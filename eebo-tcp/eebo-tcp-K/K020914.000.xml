            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THOUGH the Study of Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory be inſtructive and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; yet, in one Reſpect, it becomes the Source of frequent Error, even when it is written with Impartiality and Truth. This ariſeth from a <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Application</hi> of <hi>hiſtorical Facts.</hi> This Error is apt to creep into all Reaſonings, on every Subject, where <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> are concerned; but it is peculiarly apt to infect <hi>political</hi> Reaſonings, above all others. As the political Intereſts of Men make
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0801700100:4"/>
the principal Subject of Hiſtory, ſo the political Reaſoner hath Recourſe to Hiſtory, as the beſt Support of his Argument. But, though the Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian is, of all others, the readieſt to appeal to Hiſtory, yet he ſeems, of all others, moſt liable to be miſtaken in his Application of it to his own Purpoſe; becauſe the political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions and Intereſts of Men are, above all others, <hi>complicated</hi> and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi> Hence, as no two political Conſtitutions were ever <hi>the ſame</hi> in <hi>all</hi> their Circumſtances, though <hi>ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> in <hi>many</hi>; ſo, all Arguments drawn from a <hi>partial Reſemblance</hi> muſt be <hi>inadequate</hi> and <hi>inconcluſive</hi>; unleſs when it appears, that no other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances took Place, by which that <hi>partial Reſemblance</hi> might be <hi>counteracted,</hi> and it's Effects <hi>deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0801700100:5"/>
Yet it hath been a Practice too common among political Reaſoners, from a <hi>partial</hi> Reſemblance between two States, to infer a <hi>total</hi> one; and, becauſe they have been <hi>like</hi> in <hi>ſome</hi> Reſpects, to draw Concluſions, as if they had been <hi>like</hi> in <hi>all.</hi> Here, then, appears a Source of perpetual Error.</p>
            <p>Among all the political Queſtions that can be debated in a free Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there is none of greater Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, than that which regards the <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> of the <hi>Body of a People.</hi> Nothing hath been more uſual among political Reaſoners, than to repreſent the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>every People,</hi> as the ready <hi>Tools</hi> of <hi>Demagogues</hi> and <hi>Faction:</hi> And ſince the endleſs Factions of the <hi>Athenian Republic</hi> have been ſo often alledged, as unanſwerable Proofs
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0801700100:6"/>
of this; the intelligent Reader will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcern, that the Tendency of the following Dialogue is, to fix this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to it's <hi>proper Limits,</hi> and prevent a too <hi>general Application</hi> of a <hi>particular Fact.</hi>

               <p>I AM glad to have found you, PERICLES: Since your Converſation with COSMO, (which, you know, I overheard) I have been revolving the Subject of it in my Mind; and begin to think, you left the Matter ſhort.</p>

               <p>Your Sentiments on this Subject will give me Pleaſure. Tell me, ARISTIDES; in what Reſpect do you eſteem the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of our Argument to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>With Regard to yourſelf, I think your Concluſions were juſt: I grant you, <q>that by weakening the Power of the Court of the AREOPAGUS, you tore up that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, which SOLON had fixed, to keep his Republic ſtedfaſt and firm, againſt the Storms of popular Faction.</q> On this Account, I farther muſt allow, that <q>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Integrity which you preſerved in your public Conduct, and the great Virtues which you exerted, your Place in <hi>Elyſium</hi> is juſtly below that of thoſe, who have governed Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, or <hi>limited Monarchies,</hi> not merely with a Concern for their preſent Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; but with a prudent Regard to that <hi>Balance</hi> of <hi>Power,</hi> on which their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Happineſs</hi> always depends.</q>

               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>If you allow me this, it is all I contend for. What could remain farther to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted in the Debate?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>I am of Opinion, that the Queſtion was decided in too general a Manner: And that for Want of a little more Particularity of Argument and Proof, Concluſions might be <hi>plauſibly</hi> drawn, which would be very diſtant from the Truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, explain yourſelf a little farther, ARISTIDES; for as yet I do not clearly comprehend you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>What I mean is this: That Free States, or <hi>limited Monarchies,</hi> though they may greatly reſemble each other in their <hi>external Conſtruction,</hi> may yet be ſo very unlike in their <hi>internal Condition,</hi> that no juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0801700100:10"/>
could be drawn concerning their Proſperity and Welfare, merely from their <hi>external Reſemblance.</hi> Thus we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two States to be equally <hi>free,</hi> in their legal Conſtitution: But let us farther ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the <hi>Manners</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> which prevail in theſe two States are widely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and, in that Caſe, I apprehend, that if you regard only the legal <hi>Form</hi> of the Conſtitution, without weighing the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of the Members of the State, you will be in great Danger of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>falſe Concluſions</hi> on yourſelf and others.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>I did not force any of theſe Concluſions upon you. They are of your own making.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, you did not force them upon me: Yet they are not of my own making. For ſome of the <hi>Shades,</hi> who overheard your Converſation, have ſince told me, that the general Turn of your Diſcourſe <hi>oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led</hi> to theſe Concluſions; and therefore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0801700100:11"/>
thought that it would become ARISTIDES to diſcuſs this Point with a little more Preciſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>I am ready to hear any thing you have to ſay on this intereſting Subject.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>You will give me leave then, to examine ſome things that paſſed in your Diſcourſe with COSMO.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>Pray be as free with them as you pleaſe. I rely on the Candor as well as Juſtice of ARISTIDES.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>I will endeavour to deſerve your favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Opinion. You may remember, you ſaid <q>That by weakening the Power of the Court of AREOPAGUS, you tore up that Anchor, which SOLON had fixed, to keep his Republic ſtedfaſt and firm, againſt the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0801700100:12"/>
Storms of popular Factions.</q> This, I think, was the firſt Foundation of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>It was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>Is it a ſafe Practice, PERICLES, to build an Argument on a Metaphor?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhould think it is; provided the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor contain a juſt Image of the Fact in Queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>That I allow: but ſtill the Queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, whether the Metaphor contain that juſt Image or not. So that we are not yet advanced a Step towards the Diſcovery of Truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0801700100:13"/>
               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>At leaſt it is an Illuſtration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>Then, I think it had better have come after the Diſcovery. I believe I can give you another Metaphor which ſhall lead di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the contrary Concluſion. 'Tis a wiſe Practice, you ſay, to keep fixed the <hi>Anchor.</hi> In general, I grant you, it is ſo. Yet you know, that in Times of Tempeſt and Diſtreſs, the moſt experienced Admiral, when anchored near a rocky Shore, is forced to <hi>ſlip his Cables,</hi> and commit his Fleet to the <hi>wide Sea,</hi> till he can <hi>anchor</hi> on a <hi>ſafer Bottom.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>That is a dangerous Practice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>True: and therefore never to be tryed, except in a Time of extreme Danger.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>Well: I will grant you that a Metaphor proves nothing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>That is the only Purpoſe for which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended mine. We will proceed, therefore, with our Argument. And the ſum of what I have to ſay, will only tend to the Proof of this ſingle Point; <q>That a <hi>free State,</hi> or <hi>limited Monarchy,</hi> reſembling that of <hi>Athens</hi> in it's external Form, may yet be ſo differently circumſtanced in it's <hi>internal Condition,</hi> that a Conduct in many Reſpects ſimilar to Yours, ſhall be the only means of <hi>ſaving</hi> that State from Ruin, though Your well meant Conduct led the State of <hi>Athens</hi> to it's <hi>Deſtruction.</hi>

               <p>O PERICLES, you view the Queſtion with a partial Eye: What you call a <hi>ſecond Breach</hi> in the Conſtitution is indeed no more than the natural Effort of the <hi>ſound Parts</hi> of the Body politic, to <hi>throw off</hi> the <hi>morbific Matter</hi> by which it is oppreſſed. Thus in the natural Body, all Diſeaſes come to their Criſis, and a Cure is effected by the Vigour and Activity of the uninfected Parts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever then the Diſeaſe lies, either in the Body politic, or the Body natural, the ſound Parts muſt check and throw off that which is infected, or Death enſues. — Thus, you ſee, ſuppoſing the <hi>People</hi> to be <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>honeſt,</hi> and the Court of AREOPAGUS <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi> or <hi>incapable,</hi> the only Means of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State is the Power which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have to <hi>check</hi> and <hi>reform</hi> the Court of the AREOPAGUS.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>So far from it, that it is the only Way of <hi>fixing</hi> it; by bringing it back to it's firſt Principles. — How did this famed Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution firſt ariſe? Was it not by the united Conſent of the ſeveral Ranks of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, each of which had their ſeveral Privileges and Powers appropriated, on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of applying them to the public Good? The Court of the AREOPAGUS violates it's Engagements: The Voice of an honeſt and abuſed People rouzes them from their fatal Dream: What is the natural Conſequence? Why, ſurely, the Reformation of the Court of the AREOPAGUS. An <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>ſenſible</hi> People never deſires more than <hi>Redreſs</hi> of Grievances; and, when that is obtained, return <hi>chearfully</hi> to <hi>Subordination,</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> their <hi>Rulers.</hi>

And thus you ſee, that as the <hi>ſmall, ignorant,</hi> and <hi>needy</hi> Body of the <hi>Athenian</hi> People, in ſuch a State as You and I beheld it, is the eaſieſt of all to be ſeduced by Eloquence, or gained by Bribes; ſo, upon it's being aggrandized into ſuch a <hi>vaſt, knowing,</hi> and <hi>wealthy</hi> Body, as I have here ſuppoſed, it would, above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have been ſecure againſt the Attacks either of <hi>Eloquence</hi> or <hi>Corruption.</hi>

               <p>I perceive, I have been confounding two Things together, as being altogether <hi>ſimilar,</hi> when, in Reality, their Qualities are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>oppoſite</hi>; and this, merely becauſe they are called by the <hi>ſame Appellation,</hi> the <q>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People.</q>

               <p>I confeſs, ARISTIDES, that in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with COSMO, theſe diſtinguiſhing Particularities were not ſufficiently attended to. I drew Inferences, and extended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, to all free States, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which could only be juſtly applyed to a ſmall Republic, circumſtanced like that of <hi>Athens.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>You ſee then, PERICLES, that if <hi>Athens</hi> had been a great, rich, literate, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Republic, under the Appearance and Name of a <hi>limited Monarchy,</hi> you could have had no Chance for ſeducing the whole collective Body of the People, either by Bribes or Eloquence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>I allow it.</p>

               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>You ſee farther, that in Caſe of any Delinquency in the Courts of the AREO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PAGUS, if you had exerted your Talents in Support of the <hi>general Welfare,</hi> this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> People, with one united Voice, would have <hi>adopted</hi> and <hi>adored</hi> you: Yet only ſo long as you had made that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Welfare the undoubted Object of your Labours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
               <p>It ſeems probable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>You ſee then, that by building your Power on ſo firm a Foundation, you would have been enabled to diſpenſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> with Juſtice and Vigour; that you could have <hi>diſplaced</hi> the <hi>incapable</hi> and <hi>unworthy,</hi> and put into <hi>Action</hi> thoſe who were <hi>moſt fit</hi> to diſcharge the ſeveral Offices of the Commonwealth;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0801700100:45"/>
that you could, <hi>by Degrees,</hi> have checked the Venality and Incapacity of the various Ranks, and thus have given the proper <hi>Elaſticity</hi> and <hi>Tone</hi> to the ſeveral Parts of the Body politic.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>All this I think poſſible to have been done.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
               <p>But in doing all this, you would have been ſo far from <hi>unhinging</hi> Government, that you would have <hi>new-hinged</hi> it when it was <hi>falling</hi>; ſo far from <hi>deſtroying</hi> the <hi>Balance</hi> of <hi>Power,</hi> that you would have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed</hi> it when it had been <hi>deſtroyed</hi>; ſo far from acting with a View to <q>preſent Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</q> only, that you would have ſecured the <hi>future Welfare</hi> of the State; ſo far from conſulting a mere <hi>temporary Felicity,</hi> that you would have fixed it on a Principle of <hi>permanent Happineſs.</hi>
