            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Breeding of <hi>Worms</hi> in Human Bodies.</head>
               <p>THAT our Bodies ſhould become the Prey of <hi>Worms,</hi> when they are returning to their Original Duſt, might be ſubmitted to without Regret; but to be ſeiz'd on before that time, and even
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0491400600:3"/>upon our very Entrance on Life, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Innocence ſhould ſuſtain the Fate of the Profane <hi>Prometheus,</hi> in having their tender Bowels corroded by theſe Inteſtine Vultures, is a Condition exceedingly deplorable, and yet ſo very frequent, that 'tis almoſt always ſuſpected in Children on every Diſorder, and not unjuſtly; ſince, as <hi>Platerus</hi> obſerves, few Perſons are free from <hi>Worms;</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience verifies the Obſervation in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection of Dead Bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has aſſur'd us, That unborn Infants are invaded by them; and <hi>Dolaeus</hi> in Diſſecting an Infant, which dy'd as ſoon as born, tells us, he found a Cluſter of <hi>Worms</hi> in its Bowels.</p>
               <p>The Phyſicians and Philoſophers of former Ages, had a very ſhort and eaſy Way of Accounting for the Generation of Inſects, by ſuppoſing them bred of themſelves, out of ſome putrefying Matter, by the Aſſiſtance of Heat or Motion.</p>
               <p>But this Account is now juſtly rejected, as extreamly Abſurd and Unreaſonable, by thoſe, who have been the leaſt acquainted with the great and ſurprizing Diſcoveries of the Modern Philoſophers; who, by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Microſcopes (an Advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0491400600:4"/>to former Ages) have found, that the minuteſt Inſects are furniſh'd with all the Parts that are neceſſary, not only for Life, but alſo for the Propagation of their ſeveral Kinds, as perfect as in larger Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; and conſequently, are not produc'd at Random; but are the regular Off-ſpring of Parents of the ſame Kind, no leſs than others.</p>
               <p>It's obſervable, that Nature's wiſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has given ſuch a Propenſion to thoſe Creatures, who cannot bring up their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, to lay their Eggs in Places proper to breed them. Thus Flies commonly drop theirs in <hi>dead Bodies, Pustles, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe in ſuch tender Parts their Eggs may lie eaſy, and find Warmth ſufficient to hatch them; and afterwards, Humidity and Food for the Nouriſhment of the Animal. An Inſtance of this is related by Mr. <hi>de la Croſs,</hi> in his <hi>Memoirs, p.</hi> 229.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman had her Leg ſwoln and glandulous, about a Span from the Knee; the Chyrurgion, who had it in Cure, to know the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, took off this glandulous Body to the Bigneſs of a Nail, waſh'd it in Brandy, cut it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd therein a great many little <hi>Worms;</hi> whereupon, having conſulted Mr. <hi>Leeuwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoeck,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0491400600:5"/>he affirm'd, they were come from the Eggs, which a Fly had lain in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd Part, as he prov'd in the following Manner; He put theſe <hi>Worms</hi> into a Box, with a Piece of raw Beef, which was ſoon conſum'd by them, as well as the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Body, wherein they were hatch'd; He fed them three ſeveral times, and five Days after, <hi>viz. July</hi> 31, he found his Box empty; but having look'd carefully about the Room, he recover'd ſome of theſe <hi>Worms,</hi> that would eat no more, and were already grown to the length of ones Nail: He put them on a Paper, cover'd with a large Glaſs; and the next Day, in the Morning, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd one of theſe <hi>Worms</hi> ſhortned, but encreas'd a third Part in Bulk, ſo that it had ſomething of the ſhape of a Tun: In the Evening, he perceiv'd four others in the ſame Poſture, which from White became Red.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 11. The Cods of theſe <hi>Worms</hi> were all black, he open'd one of them, whence he took out a perfect Fly, that was yet wet and motionleſs: He obſerv'd, that beſides the Cod, this Inſect was wrap'd up in a very thin Membrane. He open'd this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Fly, and found a great quantity of Eggs in its Body.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0491400600:6"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 15. All the Flies inclos'd in the Glaſs were hatch'd, and at the ſame time he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd other Flies againſt the Glaſs-Windows of his Chamber, which he had ſuppos'd to have come from thoſe <hi>Worms,</hi> which he had not retriev'd. In feeding theſe Infects, moſt part dy'd, or fled away: So that, <hi>Sept.</hi> 7. he had but Two left, that were probably Male and Female, for they laid 145 Eggs; ſome of which he caus'd to be hatch'd in leſs than 24 Hours, by carrying them in his Pocket, ſhut up in a Box.</p>
               <p>The Learn'd <hi>Baglivi,</hi> Phyſician at <hi>Rome,</hi> in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Andry</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> writes thus concerning the Breeding of <hi>Worms.</hi> The Beginning and Original of all Animals and Vegetables is from an Egg; for what elſe are the Seeds of Plants but Eggs, in which all the Rudiments of the future Plant are contracted, as it were, into a ſhort Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium? And thoſe, by Virtue of the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Nutritive Juice, by the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Power of the Air, and the double Warmth, one of the Sun, and the other of the central Warmth of the Earth, the great Mother of all, are uncover'd by little and little; and their Fetters being as it were loos'd, they grow, and arrive in due time to ſuch a Bulk, as great as is allotted to every ſort of Plant by the Laws of Nature.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0491400600:7"/>
               <p>If all Philoſophers and Phyſicians think thus concerning Vegetables, much more muſt they think ſo of living Creatures, not only of thoſe that are call'd Perfect, but of the Imperfect alſo, which are commonly call'd Inſects. For beſides, that there is the ſame equal Order in all Things, and that all come from one Principle, and after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain general Circuit, end all in one again; Inſects, by an admirable Connexion and Conſtruction of Parts, and by a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Exerciſe of vital Operations, do not only, in no wiſe, give place to Plants, but far excel them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſince no Man ſays that Plants riſe from Putrefaction, they ought not in Reaſon to deduce the Original of Inſects, and other baſer Animals from thence. For 'tis a ſhame to Philoſophers and Phyſicians, in this moſt happy Age of Sciences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Cauſes of Things are illuſtrated by Experiments, and ſolid Precepts of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, to aſcribe to the fortuitous Chance of Putrefaction, that which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and perpetual Law of Nature, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its Seeds, rules and directs.</p>
               <p>For 'tis not Putrefaction that produces im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect living Creatures, but the Heat and Fermentation of the Things putrefying, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0491400600:8"/>makes fruitful the Seeds of Things ſpread all over the World, if I may be allow'd ſo to ſpeak; or rather, it ſtirs up, and revives the imperceptible Parts of the future living Creature in the Egg; and, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires 'em with the firſt Life, in the ſame manner with the Heat of the Sun, or that of brooding Hens.</p>
               <p>What we have ſaid of Inſects in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, may be aptly apply'd to the <hi>Worms</hi> bred in Human Bodies, ſeeing they are not generated by putrefying Humours; but the Worms Eggs lying hid in the Inteſtines, are enliven'd, and brought forth by the ſame Means.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the ſeveral Kinds of <hi>Worms</hi> bred in Human Bodies.</head>
               <p>THESE pernicious Animals differ greatly, not only among themſelves, as to Shape, and other Circumſtances; but alſo in reſpect of the ſeveral Parts of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0491400600:9"/>Body they poſſeſs, and whence they receive their Denomination.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Cephalick</hi> breed in the Head, where they occaſion violent Pains, Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſometimes contagious Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; <hi>Sennertus</hi> mentions a Perſon afflicted with an Head-Ach violent to Diſtraction; when after ſeven Days Continuance, and the Patient almoſt dead with the Pain, a <hi>Worm</hi> came out of his right Noſtril, above a Span long, after which he ſoon recover'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Andry</hi> ſays, he knew a Man, who being cur'd of a <hi>Venereal Diſeaſe,</hi> complain'd afterwards of an unſufferable Pain in his Head; for which his Skull was trepan'd, and a little ſhort <hi>Worm</hi> was found upon the <hi>Dura-mater;</hi> which being taken out, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient recover'd a perſect Health.</p>
               <p>Such another Caſe is related by <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> only the <hi>Worm</hi> he ſpeaks of was Black.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hild-ſheim</hi> tells of a Perſon, who voided Thirteen long <hi>Worms</hi> alive, and Woolly like a <hi>Caterpiller</hi> from his Noſtrils, Ears and Mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C. Gemma</hi> reports of a Matron dying of a Peſtilential Fever, whoſe Head being open'd,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0491400600:10"/>there appear'd abundance of <hi>Worms,</hi> both in the Subſtance of the Brain, and between the Coverings, and alſo Swarms of Inſects like <hi>Bugs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Account which <hi>F. Angelinus</hi> ſent his Friend is wonderful, concerning a Perſon who had an Epidemical Fever, and was reſtleſs eight Nights; when, upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, he was troubled with an Itching in his right Noſtril; and ſoon after there came out of it a <hi>Worm</hi> as long as ones little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, its Body thick and red, its Head black and hard, with two ſharp Arms like thoſe of a <hi>Scorpion;</hi> ſix Feet towards the Head, and ſome ſmall ones towards the Tail, on which it walk'd very briskly; it liv'd four Days without Food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kerckingius</hi> in his Anatomical Obſervations, gives us the Figure of an Hairy horn'd <hi>Worm,</hi> which came out of the Noſtril of a Woman at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> on the 21ſt of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1688. which he kept alive 'till the 3d of <hi>October,</hi> without giving it any Food: And which is very Remarkable, it brought forth another <hi>Worm</hi> before it dy'd.</p>
               <p>A Peſtilential Fever rag'd at <hi>Beneventum,</hi> and ſwept off abundance of People; at length the Phyſicians opening the Head of one that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0491400600:11"/>dy'd of it, found a little live <hi>Worm</hi> very ſhort, and all over red; and having try'd ſeveral Things to kill it, found nothing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual but the Decoction of <hi>Radiſhes</hi> in <hi>Malmſey</hi> Wine, which was no ſooner pour'd on the <hi>Worm</hi> but it dy'd; after which they adminiſtred the ſame Remedy to all their Patients, and almoſt all recover'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Schenckius</hi> alſo relates, That in the Year 1571. and Epidemical Fever rag'd in <hi>Ancona,</hi> which caus'd a furious Giddineſs, and Death on the third or fourth Day. All the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of the Place confeſs'd they did not underſtand the Diſeaſe, and conſequently knew not how to cure it. A rich young Man finding a Periodical Pain beginning in his Head, became apprehenſive of being ſeiz'd with the Diſtemper; and being fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ingenuous Acknowledgment of the Phyſicians, left the Country, and went to <hi>Venice;</hi> where calling for a Conſultation of the moſt Learned Phyſicians, one of them aſſerted, that a <hi>Worm</hi> in the Brain was the occaſion of thoſe Periodical Pains, which were ſo violent in the Paroxyſm, without diſturbing his Reaſon or Memory, that it ſeem'd as if his Head had been bored with an Iron.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0491400600:12"/>
               <p>They adminiſtred ſeveral Things without Effect, ſo that he dy'd in three Days time after his Arrival. They open'd his Head, and found on the Right ſide, under the <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mater</hi> the Head of a <hi>Worm,</hi> which by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the cold Air, immediately retir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Subſtance of the Brain. They then cut open the Ventricles of the Brain, and trac'd out the <hi>Worm,</hi> which was all over Red, as long as one's Fore-finger; the Head black and pointed, and the Neck Hairy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amatus Luſit.</hi> took a <hi>Worm</hi> out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Corner of a Girl's Eye; 'twas half a Span long, white, and alive when taken out.</p>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>Worms</hi> are found in the Ear, as in a Girl of Ten Years old, who was afflicted with the Evil, and had a violent Pain in the Right Ear, which ſuppurated from time to time, and ſometimes ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Deaf. Mr. <hi>Andry,</hi> after a fruitleſs Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſeveral Remedies, ſuſpected <hi>Worms,</hi> and apply'd an Ointment for that Purpoſe; whereupon abundance of ſmall <hi>Worms</hi> came forth, they were yellow, long, and very ſlender.</p>

                  <hi>Kerkingius</hi> gives an Account of five <hi>Worms,</hi> which came from a Man's Ear in the Year 1663. very much like Hog-Lice.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>Worms</hi> which breed under a Cruſt, that covers the ſurface of the Teeth. They are very ſmall, and have a round Head, mark'd with a black Point, the other Part of their Body being long and ſlender. Theſe <hi>Worms</hi> corrode the Teeth by degrees, and occaſion a Stink, but no violent Pain. They are call'd <hi>Dentarii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even the Liver has been obſerv'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain theſe Inſects, ſo <hi>Caſper Bauhinus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, That in <hi>October</hi> 1578. ſeveral ſmall <hi>Worms</hi> were found in the Liver of a Child of two Years of Age, that dy'd of the <hi>Small-Pox:</hi> They were red, round, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long and ſoft; it ſeem'd ſtrange to ſeveral Phyſicians, who were preſent at the opening: But it may be conſider'd, that there may be ſeveral Accidents, wherein the Gall in the Liver may be ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, as to loſe very much of its Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thereby permit the Ingendring of <hi>Worms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſometimes breed in the Heart, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning violent Pains, Swoonings and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0491400600:14"/>Death. Thus <hi>Sphererius</hi> writes, That a <hi>Florentine</hi> Gentleman diſcourſing one Day with a Stranger, in the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi>'s Court, drop'd down dead, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and his Body being open'd on Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of Poiſon, a live <hi>Worm</hi> was found in the Heart.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pleuriſy</hi> has been often obſerv'd to be occaſion'd by <hi>Worms. Gabucinus</hi> viſited a Maid, ſeiz'd with a <hi>Pleuriſy,</hi> and obſerving her cold and hot reciprocally, and in her hot Fits one of her Cheeks very red, the other continuing pale, ſuſpecting <hi>Worms,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd her a Medicine for that purpoſe, which, brought away a great Number of <hi>Worms,</hi> and thereupon the <hi>Pleuriſy</hi> left her.</p>
               <p>Several ancient Men, as <hi>Quercitan</hi> teſtifies, defunct, of <hi>Pleuriſies,</hi> had their Inteſtines full of large <hi>Worms,</hi> which he concluded the Cauſe of that Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> in his <hi>Obſervations,</hi> relates ſuch a Caſe of a Youth about Fourteen Years of Age, of a thin and bilious Conſtitution, who in a very ſharp Winter, having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Cold, was ſeiz'd with a true <hi>Pleuriſy,</hi> attended with a continual Fever; a prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pain in his leſt Breaſt, reaching to his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0491400600:15"/>Throat, a difficulty in Breathing, a violent Cough, and Spitting of Blood; his Body was by Intervals cold and hot, with a Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Cheeks, and a great Reſtleſsneſs. About the fifth Day of the Diſeaſe, being Coſtive, a Gliſter of Milk was injected, which brought away five <hi>Worms,</hi> which were <hi>Teretes;</hi> wherefore with ſome Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Medicines, which were before preſcrib'd, the following Powder was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</p>

               </p>
               <p>After which <hi>Worms</hi> came away daily, in all above Thirty, and he recover'd.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Andry</hi> had ſo remarkable a Caſe of this ſort, that it put him upon Writing an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Book on the Subject of <hi>Worms.</hi> The Caſe was this, On the 4th of <hi>June,</hi> 1698. a young Man, about Thirty Years of Age, was ſeiz'd with a Fever, great Pain in his Side, Spitting of Blood, and Difficulty of Breathing. He began the Cure by Opening a Vein, and repeated the ſame the next Day, on the 3d he ſweated, on the 4th he ſeem'd to be much better; but from thence to the 5th he had a <hi>Delirium,</hi> which went off the next Morning. The <hi>Delirium</hi> not being
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0491400600:16"/>preceded by the uſual Signs, occaſion'd a Suſpicion of <hi>Worms,</hi> and finding withal a great many in his Excrements by Stool, he preſcrib'd a purging Medicine the next Morning (which has been very ſucceſsful in that Caſe) an Hour after the taking it, the Patient found ſomething ſtir in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which Motion continu'd two Hours, and determin'd in the Iſſuing forth of a live <hi>Worm,</hi> or rather Link of <hi>Worms,</hi> four Ells three Inches in Length, being the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbitini,</hi> which are particularly deſcrib'd, <hi>p.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>Sometimes we meet with 'em in the Blood, where they obſtruct the Orifice in Bleeding; ſo a Chirurgion at <hi>Paris,</hi> whilſt he was Bleeding a Patient, found the Blood ſtop on a ſudden; and turning up the Arm to find the Cauſe, he ſaw an horned <hi>Worm</hi> as long as an <hi>Earwig,</hi> which burſt out with Violence along with the Blood.</p>
               <p>Such another Accident is related by Mr. <hi>de la Croſe,</hi> in his <hi>Memoirs,</hi> of Mr. <hi>du Puy,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Phyſician; who being preſent at the Bleeding of a Lady, his Patient, the Blood, after it had ſprung out above two Ounces, ſtop'd on a ſudden; and as he was looking for the Cauſe of it, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> Body that ſtop'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0491400600:17"/>the Orifice; whereupon taking the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion's Forceps, he drew out a <hi>Worm</hi> as big as could come out of the Inciſion.</p>
               <p>He accounts for its coming there in the following Manner: The Egg of ſome fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſect had been ſwallow'd by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in her Food, and being deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſmall Guts, went with the Chile into the Milky Veins, through all the Pores of the filtrating Glandules, the Heart, Lungs, Aorta, 'till arriving at laſt to the Extremities or the Fingers, it remain'd there among their ſmall Arteries and Veins, and was hatch'd out by the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and natural Heat of the Blood and Fleſh. Having thus gotten the Life and Motion of a <hi>Worm,</hi> it ſwam for greater Eaſe and Room into the Arm; and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the cheriſhing Liquor, wherein it was bred, it came at length to the Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Vein, whence Mr. <hi>du Pay</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted it.</p>
               <p>They have been often ſeen in the Urine, and of various Kinds; ſome like Hog-Lice, others like Mites in Cheeſe, ſome like Leeches, others like Graſs-Hoppers; of which laſt ſort was that voided by Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> when he lay ill of a continual Fever.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0491400600:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vidius</hi> writes of one, who after tedious Pains in the Kidnies, diſcharg'd a ſmall <hi>Worm</hi> by Urine; its Head was ſharp and horned, its Back and Belly broad, and cover'd with an hard Shell like a <hi>Tortoiſe,</hi> its Colour black, but reddiſh on the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sennertus</hi> ſays, he ſaw the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Kidnies of a Dog waſted, and only the outward Skin left, which was full of <hi>Worms</hi> like <hi>Earth-worms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Turberville,</hi> in the <hi>Philoſ. Tranſ. No.</hi> 167. <hi>p.</hi> 839. gives an Account of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who was much troubled with the <hi>Falling-Sickneſs,</hi> and diſcharg'd by Urine a great Number of ſhort <hi>Worms</hi> like <hi>Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes;</hi> two or three Purges were preſcrib'd her, and ſtill in every Water that was brought the Phyſician, he found, Eight, Ten, or more of thoſe <hi>Worms;</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd lively, and full of Motion, and the Fits continu'd daily; at laſt he gave her <hi>Oxymel Helleboratum</hi> in <hi>Tanſy</hi>- Water, which wrought well, and was ſucceſsful; ſo that ſhe had a compleat Cure.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Philoſ. Tranſ.</hi> there is an Account of one Mr. <hi>Thomas Dent,</hi> who being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0491400600:19"/>with <hi>Tumours</hi> on his Tongue, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf to one Mrs. <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter;</hi> who (in the Preſence of Two Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen of that Town, Mr. <hi>Gibbs,</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and others) pierc'd the Parts tumify'd with a Lancet, and drew ſome Blood; and ſoon after with a ſmall <hi>Spatula,</hi> and another Inſtrument, wherewith ſhe open'd the Orifices, ſhe pick'd out five or ſix <hi>Worms</hi> at a time. She plainly ſhew'd them to the Spectators, as they came out of the Fleſh; they were all alive, and mov'd their Heads, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſſer than ordinary <hi>Maggots:</hi> In leſs than eight Days ſhe took out of the Tongue more than an hundred <hi>Worms,</hi> almoſt all of the ſame Bigneſs, except two very large ones, which ſhe ſaid were of a Cancerous Production. She took more than Thirty out of the Gums, which laſt Operation was her ordinary Practice.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>de la Croſe</hi> in his <hi>Memoirs, p.</hi> 223. gives an Account of one <hi>Sarah Haſtings,</hi> who follow'd the ſame Practice at <hi>Holm,</hi> in <hi>Huntingdon-ſhire;</hi> and had attain'd to ſo great Skill, as to diſcern at firſt Sight, whether any Perſon had <hi>Worms</hi> great or ſmall in his Gums, Tongue or Face: Theſe <hi>Worms</hi> ſhe affirm'd to be the Cauſe of Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs of the Teeth, of <hi>Pustules,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0491400600:20"/>other Putrefactions; ſhe drew them out of any Part in three or four Minutes, with a Gooſe-Quill, cut like a Pen; ſhe pierc'd the Part ſo Dexterouſly, that the Pain was almoſt inſenſible; then ſhe threw the extracted <hi>Worms</hi> into a Glaſs of clean Water, where they appeared to have a round and red Head, the reſt of the Body being white. He there relates ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Cures of that Sort, too large to inſert here.</p>
               <p>But of all the Parts, the Stomach and Guts are the moſt uſually infeſted with <hi>Worms,</hi> eſpecially in Children: However, before we enter upon a particular Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe, which properly belong to theſe Parts, it may be convenient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Reader with ſome Hiſtories of very ſtrange Animals, excluded the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach by Vomiting. The Accounts are taken out of the <hi>Philoſ. Tranſactions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi>'s, of a Baker at <hi>York,</hi> who in <hi>March</hi> 1681/2. vomited up a <hi>Worm</hi> of a very ſtrange Figure; I found it (<hi>ſays the Doctor</hi>) in the Blood, which came up with it; having caus'd it to be waſh'd, for the more careful Examination of it; much of the Blood being Clods of a kind of skinny and fleſhy Subſtance. Of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0491400600:21"/>this kind of Blood there was about two Pounds ſav'd in the Waſhing, and this odd Animal amongſt it: It was of a dark, green Colour, like an Horſe-Leech, and ſpotted, not unlike ſome of them. I could not perceive, when I found it, any Life or Motion in it. The Girl, who waſh'd it, had beaten off almoſt a Fin, and part of one of the Forks of the Tail, and burſt its Belly; yet it was regularly and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſhap'd in all its Members. The Man imagin'd he drank it the Summer before in Pond-Water, whereof he was us'd to drink after ſore Labour in his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. This is certain, he had about his Stomach, and right Side, a moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and tormenting Pain for at leaſt four Months, which many times threw him into Horrors and Chilneſs, Ague like; and indeed, when he vomited this up, he was the ſickeſt Man I ever ſaw, not to die: He alſo voided Blood by Stool ſeveral Days.</p>
               <p>I am at a loſs where to place this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, it not being like any thing I ever ſaw in Nature. It was about four Inches long, and in the thickeſt Part three Inches about; it had three Fins on a ſide, all near the Head, and all of them were thick and fleſhy; but the forked Tail was finny and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0491400600:22"/>tranſparent, and to be extended. It was plac'd Horrizantally, not as that of moſt (if not all) ſmall Fiſh; and even <hi>Newts</hi> and <hi>Tadpoles,</hi> or <hi>Frogs</hi> in Diſguiſe, in which Particular it differs from all, as well as in the Fleſhineſs of the Fins.</p>
               <p>Beſides this odd Animal, I found the Head of another of a different Shape; but the like dark green Colour.</p>
               <p>I'm apt to think, we often eat and drink what is alive; and 'tis certain, ſome Things will live on in our Stomachs in ſpight of Concoction, as <hi>Gut-Worms</hi> bred in us, and perhaps in ſome Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are born. And yet I am of the Mind, that what was accidentally ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by us alive, and that ſhall have the Power to live on within us (eſpecially if it be young and tender) and yet growing, may have its Shape and deſign'd Form ſo monſtrouſly perverted, as to appear to us quite another Thing than naturally it is; and this I take to be the Caſe of this odd Creature, which might have been the Spawn, or Embrio of a <hi>Toad</hi> or <hi>Newt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The skinny Lumps of Blood vomited up with it, I think, may be eaſily accounted, for. For this Spawn, or Embrio of a <hi>Toad</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0491400600:23"/>or <hi>Newt,</hi> might well envenom the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach or Gut, in which Part or Wrinckle ſoever it chanc'd to reſt or ſtick firſt, and cauſe an Inflamation there, and have it ſwell'd or clos'd up within a Tumour of its own making; which in Proceſs of Time might gather to this Bigneſs, and at length burſting in Pieces, come up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Familiar Inſtances of this Nature we ſee in Fruits or Wens, which Inſects raiſe upon Vegetables; who by natural Inſtinct know how to envenom a Plant, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſly provide both Food and Houſing for their Young. <hi>So far Dr.</hi> Liſter.</p>
               <p>The next is, <hi>No.</hi> 117. <hi>p.</hi> 395. Of a Girl at <hi>Sheffield,</hi> about eight Months old, who was ſeiz'd with violent Fits of Vomiting, which held her about a Week; and Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> being ſent for, and happening to ſay, that <hi>Wormwood</hi> was good for the Stomach, whilſt he was gone to fetch ſome Things proper for that Occaſion, they in the mean Time offer'd the Child ſome <hi>Wormwood</hi> Ale, which ſhe took ſo greedily, that ſhe ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd down a Pint of it; and at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, ſhe vomited up in his Preſence three <hi>Hexapodes</hi> (i. e. <hi>Worms</hi> with ſix Feet) all very active and nimble; and the Child
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0491400600:24"/>ſoon recover'd. Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> carry'd them the ſame Day to Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> (who ſent the Account) they kill'd one of them in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Experiments upon it, but gave each of the other Two, the Head of a ſhining <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricapella</hi> (a Bird with black Feathers on its Head) which in about five Week's Time they eat up, Bones, Feathers and all, except the Extremities of the Feathers and Beaks. Then they gave them a Piece of <hi>Larus</hi> (a <hi>Sea-Cob</hi>) but that it ſeems did not agree ſo well with them, for they dy'd within two Days after.</p>
               <p>The laſt Account is Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi>'s, the Son of one not far from <hi>Rippon,</hi> about 9 Years of Age, in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1674. was afflicted with a great Pain in his Stomach, and continual Vomitings; a Powder was given him, wherein was a ſmall Quantity of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis;</hi> he thereupon vomited up ſeveral ſtrange <hi>Worms,</hi> two of which were brought the Doctor at <hi>York,</hi> one dead, the other alive, 'till he put it into Spirit of Wine, to preſerve it in its true Shape. Theſe <hi>Worms</hi> were very <hi>Caterpillers,</hi> with fourteen Legs, <hi>viz.</hi> ſix ſmall pointed, the eight middle Stumps, and the two hind ones Claſpers. They were ſomething more than an Inch long, of the thickneſs of a Duck's-Quill, thin hair'd, or rather naked, with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0491400600:25"/>brown <hi>Annuli,</hi> and black Heads; the ſame for kind, that is often ſeen on Plants. Theſe, no doubt, would in due time, if the Place had not hindred, have ſhrunk into <hi>Chryſalis's,</hi> and chang'd into <hi>Moths;</hi> as alſo thoſe mention'd by Mr. <hi>Jeſſop,</hi> in the preceeding Hiſtory, would have chang'd into <hi>Beetles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proper Inhabitants of theſe dark Regions, are of four Sorts; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Teres,</hi> the <hi>Cucurbitini,</hi> the <hi>Taenia,</hi> and the <hi>Aſcarides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Teres,</hi> or common long and round <hi>Worm,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tyſon</hi> has given a very curious Anatomical Deſcription in the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ. Tranſ. No.</hi> 147. <hi>p.</hi> 154. from whence I ſhall borrow a few Obſervations. Tho' we are gravell'd <hi>(ſays the Doctor)</hi> in Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how theſe Sorts of <hi>Worms</hi> ſhould come firſt into the Body; yet being once there, nothing is more plain, than that they are propagated by an univocal Generation; there being in this Sort, ſo perfect a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction or Sexes, Male and Female; and the Organs of each ſo curiouſly contriv'd, ſo conſpicuous and plain, as ſhew how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous Nature is in preſerving, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the meaneſt Species.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0491400600:26"/>
               <p>This <hi>Worm,</hi> which Children are uſually troubled with, is uſually a Foot long, the Male generally leſs than the Female; its thickneſs about that of a Wheat Straw, or Gooſe-Quill, at both Extreams, they grow narrow, the Mouth conſiſts of three Lips, the <hi>Anus</hi> of a tranſverſe Slit, a little before the extream Point of the Tail.</p>
               <p>In Cutting thro' the Muſcles under the Skin, there iſſu'd out a copious <hi>Ichor,</hi> which is naturally diſcharg'd by ſome Pores in the Skin, and makes a Covering to the Body, which is often caſt off, and obſerv'd as a mucous Matter in the Stools of thoſe, who are troubled with them.</p>
               <p>In Opening the <hi>Cornua <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>teri</hi> of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male <hi>Worm,</hi> they were found turgid with a Milky Juice, a little of which being plac'd on a ſmall <hi>Microſcope,</hi> was found to be nothing elſe but an infinite Number of Eggs, tho' to the naked Eye, it appear'd only as a fluid Body.</p>
               <p>By Comparing that ſmall Quantity, I did obſerve, and in which I could diſtinguiſh ſo many Eggs, with the whole Quantity contain'd, in both the <hi>Cornua,</hi> I cannot gueſs there could be fewer than Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0491400600:27"/>in each Female <hi>Worm,</hi> which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently accounts for that prodigious Number of <hi>Worms,</hi> ſometimes obſerv'd to be bred in Animal Bodies; and were it not that the greateſt Part of the Litter of this <hi>Worm</hi> is uſually carry'd forth by the <hi>Faeces,</hi> it could not be avoided, but we ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by ſuch a multiparous Enemy, bred in our own Bowels; of whoſe pernicious Effects, ſome of the following Inſtances are fatal Proofs.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> in the <hi>Philoſ. Tranſ. p.</hi> 326. <hi>No.</hi> 224. relates, That in Diſſecting a Boy of Nine Years of Age, who dy'd ſuddenly, being ſeiz'd with a Fit of Vomiting; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a great many other Diſorders of all the Bowels, they found a <hi>Worm</hi> in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach about nine Inches long, and a Line and a half broad.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>James Burrows</hi> reports, in the <hi>Philoſ. Tranſ. No.</hi> 264. <hi>p.</hi> 598. That in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> 1700. a Labouring Man of middle Age at <hi>Stanton,</hi> ſeven Miles from <hi>Bury,</hi> had for many Days together ſo inordinate an Appetite, that he eat up an ordinary Leg of Veal roaſted at a Meal. He would eat Sow-Thiſtles, and divers other Herbs, as greedily, during the time his <hi>Bulimia</hi> laſted, as the Beaſts that uſe ſuch Food;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0491400600:28"/>and all he could get was little enough to ſatisfy his Hunger, 'till at length he voided divers <hi>Worms,</hi> as long, and as big about as a Tobacco-Pipe; after which, his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite declin'd by degrees, 'till it came to the common Rate of others.</p>
               <p>We have alſo an Account, in the ſame Place, of a Diſſection perform'd by the <hi>Sieur Soye,</hi> in an Hoſpital, on the Body of a Servant Maid, about twenty ſix Years of Age, who was from time to time ſeiz'd with a <hi>Bloody-Flux.</hi> He found the <hi>Colon,</hi> and part of the <hi>Meſentery</hi> ulcerated, the Mouth of which <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> was ſo large, that one might eaſily thruſt in his Fiſt at it, and 'twas ſtop'd with a Clew of <hi>Worms</hi> greater than it.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Obſervations</hi> writes, That the Son of Sir <hi>Lewis Dive,</hi> a Child of a good Conſtitution of Body, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Indiſpoſition of two or three Days, attended with a dry Cough, and a reſtleſs Condition, eſpecially in the Night, with continual Cryings, was at length ſeiz'd with violent and continual <hi>Convulſions,</hi> whereof in three Days he dy'd. In cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting open the Body to diſcover the Cauſe, they were ſoon ſatisfy'd, when they found the <hi>Duodenum</hi> quite eaten thro' by a <hi>Teres,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0491400600:29"/>or long <hi>Worm,</hi> which was taken out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Fevers</hi> tells us, He knew one in an acute <hi>Fever,</hi> who was moleſted with continual Swoonings, 'till he vomited up a long round <hi>Worm;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Swoonings left him.</p>
               <p>Examples of this Kind are very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and 'tis no wonder to meet with this Species in their proper Soil; but the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> has publiſh'd in the <hi>Philoſ. Tranſ.</hi> is very ſurprizing; <hi>viz.</hi> In <hi>April</hi> 1673. a Chyrurgion at <hi>York</hi> brought him about twenty <hi>Worms,</hi> which he had juſt taken out of an ulcerated Ancle of a Girl about eight Years of Age; ſhe had been in great Miſery ſome Months, and had been ſent up to <hi>London,</hi> where ſhe was touch'd and dreſs'd for the <hi>Evil;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after her Return, her Pain continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a young Puppy was open'd, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Sore. The Chyrurgion, who took off the Puppy, found it to his great Surprize full of <hi>Worms,</hi> at leaſt ſixty in Number, of the Species of the <hi>Teretes,</hi> which Children familiarly void from the Guts. They were between three and four Inches long, all about an equal Bigneſs, as of one Brood, ſomething thicker than a <hi>Duck's</hi>-Quill,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0491400600:30"/>very ſharp at both Ends; ſtiff, and exactly round, and yet could move, and twiſt themſelves viſibly enough. The Leg was ſound, all but the Ancle, which was vaſtly ſwell'd, and the Girl otherwiſe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and well colour'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Taenia,</hi> or Tape <hi>Worm,</hi> ſo call'd from its Reſemblance to a Tape or Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, is broad and flat, and white; its Thinneſs renders it diaphanous, its Length is very uncertain, becauſe its Subſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſoft and tender; it uſually breaks off when it comes away, ſo that 'tis very rare to find it entire; the whole is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Length of all the Bowels, that is, ſeven times the Length of the Man; but lying very much folded together, takes up but little Room; it uſually comes away Piece-meal, ſeven or eight Foot long, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times nineteen, twenty three, thirty; forty five Foot of it has been found broke off at a time; it grows gradually ſmaller towards the Tail, which terminates in a very ſmall and long Part like an Hair; in its wideſt Part, its Breadth is about that of one's Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spigelius</hi> tells us of a Woman, who void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſeveral times ſeveral Pieces of this <hi>Wormy,</hi> whereof two were extraordinary
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0491400600:31"/>long. The firſt that came away, was two Yards and a half long, containing the Tail Part of the <hi>Worm,</hi> but wanting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Part of the Tail, perhaps unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly broke off by the Patient before, part of it hanging out of the <hi>Anus;</hi> her Siſter drew it forth ſo far, but tir'd with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Length, ſhe broke it off with her Nails; this Piece, in that Part where it was freſh broke off, was as broad as ones little Finger, and became narrower gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as it approach'd the Tail; its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was ſoft, throughout white, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs like a Membrane of the Guts. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Piece that came away about a Year after, was eight Foot long, and the breadth of ones Middle-Finger; the Joints were larger and thicker, the Inciſures wider, and the Sides more jagged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fabricius</hi> gives a Deſcription of the like Sort of <hi>Worm,</hi> which a Woman of twenty Years of Age voided, upon taking a Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicine, which was twenty Spans long; one of the Extreams was as ſlender as a Thread, the other broad.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author relates the following Hiſtory.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0491400600:32"/>
               <p>A Lady at <hi>Lauſanne,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> very ſubject in her Youth to Palpitations of the Heart; and after a ſort of Purge ſhe us'd to take, ſhe voided ſometimes very long Pieces of <hi>Worms.</hi> After ſhe was marry'd, and began to have Children, her Palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions left her, only ſhe was troubled with a <hi>Lienteria;</hi> during which, ſhe voided down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſeveral Pieces of <hi>Worms;</hi> ſome ſix, ſome nine, others ten Spans long. Every time ſhe voided theſe Pieces, ſhe felt the <hi>Worms</hi> break in her Bowels; one Day, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking her Remedy, ſhe voided a Piece of <hi>Worm</hi> ſeven Ells long; and a few Days after, another Piece, without perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as before that any thing broke; from which time ſhe became perfectly well. All the Pieces put together, would make above twenty Ells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olaus Borrhicius</hi> tells us, That a Patient of his has voided eight hundred Foot of this <hi>Worm</hi> in ſeveral Pieces; and that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, he has not met with the Head; for the Patient declar'd, that always in the Voiding, he perceiv'd it break off.</p>
               <p>A Sucking-Child (by the Relation of <hi>Caſp. Wolphius</hi>) brought forth a broad <hi>Worm,</hi> at leaſt three Ells long.</p>

The <hi>Cucurbitinj,</hi> or ſpurious jointed Tape <hi>Worm; Valliſnerius,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, has publiſh'd a very large and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Deſcription of this Species of <hi>Gut-Worms,</hi> the Reſult of his indefatigable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, from whom I have taken this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count following. <hi>Anno</hi> 1706. viſiting a <hi>Jeweſs,</hi> twenty five Years of Age, three Months gone with Child (who, like many of that Nation, was incident to broad <hi>Worms,</hi> which in her third or fourth Month, uſually occaſion'd her to Miſcarry; but when ſhe was not with Child, they never gave her any Diſturbance. She often void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by Vomiting and Stool, many of theſe <hi>Worms,</hi> as well ſingly as link'd together, in the manner of a Chain:) She had juſt diſcharg'd a very long Chain of theſe <hi>Worms,</hi> beſides ſeveral ſingly. He ſeparated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Pains, many of theſe from each other in that Part which was largeſt; but obſerv'd, they were very ſtrictly joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Every one of theſe conſiſted of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous, ſoft, white, ſhining, flexible and ſlippery Matter; the upper Part ſmaller than the lower.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0491400600:34"/>
               <p>In the upper Side of each there ariſe two very ſmall Prominences, which, when preſs'd with the Fingers, feel like little Horns, or crooked Thorns, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous by the <hi>Microſcope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe they adhere firmly to the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Part of the preceding <hi>Worm,</hi> in whoſe poſtick Part are Cavities fitted to receive theſe Prominences.</p>
               <p>The lateral Parts of theſe <hi>Worms</hi> are rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and out of their Middle riſes a kind of <hi>Tet,</hi> whoſe Center is perforated with a very conſpicuous Opening, and pours out ſometimes a quantity of <hi>Chyle,</hi> ſometimes clear Water, ſometimes a yellow <hi>Serum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Mouth is in the narrower and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Side, between the two <hi>Protuberances;</hi> If it be objected, that if the Mouth be in this Part, they cannot receive Nouriſhment by it adhering ſo cloſely to the preceding <hi>Worm.</hi> 'Tis anſwer'd, they being fed with a fluid Matter <hi>Chyle,</hi> which penetrating e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, eaſily enters that Chink where the Mouth is, ſince the middle Part is not ſo cloſe as the Jettings.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0491400600:35"/>at other times they are more cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected.</p>
               <p>Theſe flat <hi>Worms,</hi> when ſingle, very much reſemble in Bigneſs and Shape the Seed of a <hi>Gourd,</hi> which in <hi>Latin</hi> is call'd <hi>Cucurbita,</hi> whence they are call'd <hi>Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitini;</hi> and being very numerous, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to each other ſo firmly in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid, do form a Chain of a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Length, which has been miſtaken by ſeveral very eminent Authors for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>Worm;</hi> in particular, the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Tyſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Andry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the former having given a very particular and large Account of it in the <hi>Philoſ.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Andry,</hi> in Examining theſe <hi>Worms</hi> very diligently with a <hi>Microſcope,</hi> after cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them open, perceiv'd them full of ſmall globular Bodies, reſembling that Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Eggs, uſually found in <hi>Carps:</hi> Theſe Eggs are ſo numerous, that the Quantity taken up with the Point of a Pin, tho' no bigger than a Grain of Duſt, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, under a <hi>Microſcope,</hi> an incredible Pile of ſmall Eggs; which ſufficiently accounts for the vaſt Number of theſe Inſects.</p>

                  <hi>Wagner</hi> relates of a Soldier, who was freed of ſuch a Chain of <hi>Worms</hi> ſix Ells long; and ſoon after of another longer than the former.</p>
               <p>Examples of theſe <hi>Worms</hi> are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, tho' many Authors have ſet them down ſo confuſedly, that 'tis not poſſible to diſtinguiſh whether they are the genuine <hi>Taenia,</hi> deſcrib'd in the ſecond Article, which is but one entire <hi>Worm,</hi> or this ſpurious Sort, conſiſting of a Chain of <hi>Cucurbitini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Tyſon</hi> mentions a Perſon in <hi>London,</hi> who has voided vaſt Quantities of theſe <hi>Worms</hi> for ſeveral Years together; but in ſeveral Pieces, two, three, four, ſix, or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0491400600:37"/>more Yards long; and ſays, he had a Piece by him of a great Length, voided by a young Man, upon the Uſe of an Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the cold Seeds. It was twenty four Foot long, and conſiſted of five hundred and ſeven <hi>Joints</hi> or <hi>Worms,</hi> in Thickneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that of an Half-Crown. The Perſon drag'd it from himſelf, not without fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apprehenſions, that Guts, and all were coming out.</p>
               <p>Theſe Chains of <hi>Worms</hi> lye convoluted in ſeveral Places, and are ſometimes as long as all the Guts, and ſometimes vaſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that Length.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Worms</hi> have been found ſometimes included in a Bag; which has been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ſeveral for a large <hi>Worm.</hi> The <hi>Jeweſs,</hi> before-mention'd, upon a Time imagining a large Piece of her Bowels coming from her, tho' ſhe felt no Pain, being frighted at it, ſhe ſent for her Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who was himſelf at firſt ſurpriz'd at it. This Subſtance was like a doubl'd Rowler, cloſe in every Part, compos'd of a thick, ſmooth, ſhining, tranſparent and mucilaginous Membrane, two Thumbs broad, above a Yard long; it was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and contain'd within it a numberleſs Quantity of <hi>Cucurbitini,</hi> not link'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0491400600:38"/>but every one ſeparate, their Bigneſs was various, they were all alive, and mov'd freely.</p>
               <p>This Bag ſeems to be form'd moſtly of a concreſſible Humour in the Inteſtines, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner as <hi>Polypus's</hi> in the Heart and Arteries, and is encreas'd by a glewy Matter, caſt out by theſe <hi>Worms</hi> from their lateral Orifices.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Teretes</hi> alſo, or long and round <hi>Worms,</hi> are ſometimes found involv'd in ſuch a Bag.</p>

Their Habitation is in the loweſt Part of the Inteſtines, where they provoke a continual Itching; and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſometimes moſt direful Symptoms. Dr. <hi>Curteis,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> on the Recovery of Health, gives us the following Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>A Boy, about twelve Years of Age, was ſo extreamly afflicted with ſuch formidable Symptoms, as were imputed to the Effect of Witchcraft: What gave Birth to ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a Conjecture, were the extraordinary

               <p>Several Examples of this Sort of <hi>Worms</hi> might be produc'd out of Authors; but this is ſufficient for a Specimen.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Signs of <hi>Worms</hi> from Mr. <hi>Andry.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Signs of <hi>Worms</hi> are Common or Particular.</p>
               <p>The common Signs ſhew the Genius, and the Particular the Species; that is, when the Common meet, we ſay, there are <hi>Worms;</hi> and when we find particular Signs, we may ſay, not only that there are <hi>Worms</hi> in general, but that thoſe <hi>Worms</hi> are of ſuch a particular Sort.</p>
               <p>The common Signs are fiery ſparkling Eyes, livid Cheeks, cold Sweats in the Nights, Abundance of Spittle drivelling from the Mouth in Sleep, great Drowth in the Day-time, Dryneſs of the Tongue and Lips, a Stinking-Breath, Grating of the Teeth in Sleep, a conſtant Looſeneſs, with whitiſh Excrements, frothy Urine, ſometimes White, ſometimes Obſcure, but for the moſt part Thick and Muddy.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0491400600:41"/>
               <p>Frequent Vomitings, and Convulſion-Fits are ſometimes Signs of <hi>Worms;</hi> that is, when the Vomitings throw up nothing but what has been eaten, and the Convulſions are without Foaming at the Mouth.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they riſe in their Sleep, and move their Lips as if they were eating: To know if theſe Symptoms are from <hi>Worms,</hi> obſerve, if they are eas'd by Abſtinence; for they that have <hi>Worms,</hi> cannot faſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding themſelves tormented; not by Hunger, for many times they have no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; but by Twitchings and Tearings, caus'd by the various Motions of the <hi>Worms</hi> in ſearch of Food.</p>
               <p>A dry Cough is very often a Sign of <hi>Worms;</hi> by this <hi>Foreſtus</hi> knew, that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Girl, who had been ſix Months ill of a <hi>Quartan-Ague,</hi> was troubl'd with <hi>Worms;</hi> he preſcrib'd her Medicines accordingly, which brought away five <hi>Worms,</hi> and her <hi>Ague</hi> thereupon left her.</p>
               <p>A Stinking-Breath is very often a Sign; ſo <hi>Braſſavolus,</hi> viſiting an old Man eighty Years of Age, who ſeem'd to lye a dying, knew by his Breath that he was troubl'd with <hi>Worms;</hi> he thereupon directed him
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0491400600:42"/>ſome <hi>Vermifuges,</hi> which ſcour'd away five hundred <hi>Worms,</hi> and cur'd him.</p>
               <p>Raging Hunger many times proceeds from <hi>Worms,</hi> when 'tis accompany'd with extream Leanneſs, tho' the Party eat much; thus a Boy, about twelve Years of Age (<hi>ſays</hi> Foreſtus) had kept his Bed for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Months, and was dry'd almoſt to a <hi>Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton,</hi> without feeling any other Illneſs than a ſlight Pain in his Belly, near his Navel: The Phyſician was at firſt a little at a ſtand to find out the Diſtemper, the Cauſe of which he could not imagine; for the Child eat very well, tho' to no Purpoſe; his Urine was of a good Conſiſtency and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, tho' ſomewhat Crude and Wateriſh; but the Pain of his Belly, together with his extraordinary Hunger, caus'd him to ſuſpect <hi>Worms:</hi> Therefore, for ſeveral Days, twice a Day, he order'd a Glaſs of the Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Hyſſop, Marjoram, Fennel, Fumitory, Centaury</hi> and <hi>Wormwood,</hi> with <hi>Oxymel,</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of <hi>Fumitory,</hi> and Honey of <hi>Roſes.</hi> This Medicine, every time he took it, caus'd him to void a great Number of <hi>Worms,</hi> and perfectly cur'd him.</p>
               <p>The particular Signs differ according to the Species of <hi>Worms.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0491400600:43"/>
               <p>The Signs of Long and Round <hi>Worms,</hi> are Tenſions of the Belly, with Hardneſs and Pain, Itching of the Noſe, Corroſion of the Guts, Hiccoughs, a Palpitation in Sleep, Waking with ſudden Startings, or Shrieks, an unequal Pulſe, intermitting Fevers, of which the Party will have three or four Fits, without any certain Order; the Eyes hollow, and ſometimes red; the Cheeks ſometimes glowing red, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a Lead Colour; ſometimes they want a Stomach, and vomit after Eating; they have Fevers, accompany'd with Cold in the extream Parts of the Body: Theſe Signs never meet altogether, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one, ſometimes another.</p>
               <p>The Signs of <hi>Aſcarides</hi> are a continual Itching in the Fundament, cauſing Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſometimes Swoonings; the Itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceeds from the Motion of theſe <hi>Worms,</hi> and the quick Senſe of the Part where they lye.</p>
               <p>The Signs of the <hi>Taenia,</hi> or Tape <hi>Worm,</hi> are Laſſitude, and Faintings after Meat; frequent Numbneſs and Dulneſs in the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, which cauſe an Heavineſs above the Navel, tho' theſe may proceed from other Cauſes.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0491400600:44"/>
               <p>The Signs of the <hi>Cucurbitini</hi> are little Bodies, like the Seeds of <hi>Cucumers</hi> or <hi>Melons,</hi> found in the Excrements; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are the young Brood not yet link'd together. Both <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> mention theſe as certain Signs; to which may be added ſhifting Pains of the Liver, accompany'd with great Fluxes of Spittle; Pains in the Stomach ſucceed thoſe of the Liver by Intervals, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attended with tedious Pains in the Back.</p>

                  <p>When Children are obſerv'd to rub their Bellies very much, 'tis a Sign of <hi>Worms;</hi> eſpecially if they are often grip'd.</p>
                  <p>Very often it happens, that Perſons are ſuddenly, and without any apparent Cauſe or Signs of any other Diſtemper, reduc'd to the extreameſt Danger, like the Aſſault of an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> with Coldneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Parts, a creeping Pulſe (which is moſt commonly a Sign of <hi>Worms,</hi> as is alſo the Hiccough) Swooning, and ſometimes a ſudden Madneſs; in ſuch a Caſe we ought to ſuſpect <hi>Worms,</hi> and to preſcribe accordingly.</p>

                  <p>Bleeding by Drops, in continual Fevers, from the Noſtrils, is ſometimes a Sign of <hi>Worms,</hi> as very Judicious Authors have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
                  <p>Whenever there is the leaſt Cauſe to ſuſpect <hi>Worms,</hi> by no Means defer the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Remedies; for they often occaſion ſudden Death to grown Perſons, as well as to Children or Infants.</p>
                  <p>Whatever Diſtemper Children are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with, <hi>Worms,</hi> are always to be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for either they immediately encreaſe the Diſeaſe, or by Reaſon of its Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Seeds of <hi>Worms</hi> are hatch'd into Life, and fill the Bowels with that peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Vermine.</p>

               <p>And they are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. EXternal Applications, as <hi>Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Cataplaſms, Ointments, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> all which are not a little beneficial; For as Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> obſerves, <hi>Worms</hi> do ſo ſecurely burrow, and intrench themſelves in the Foldings and Cavities of the Bowels, as to eſcape and elude the Impreſſion of Purging, or other Medicines; for which Reaſon outward Applications are very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to diſturb them from their lurking Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo expoſe them to the Attacks of Internals, which may deſtroy, and expel them.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0491400600:47"/>
               <p n="2">2. Internal Adminiſtrations, which by a ſpecifick Quality, diſturb and kill them; the Forms of theſe are various as <hi>Liquors, Syrups, Powders, Boluſſes, Pills,</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome are Purgative, others not; in the Uſe of which Dr. <hi>Andry</hi> recommends the following Obſervations.</p>
               <p>That the beſt Time to take them is in the Wain of the Moon; he confeſſes, he look'd upon this at firſt as an idle Fancy, but that his Experience convinc'd him of his Miſtake.</p>
               <p>That in the Adminiſtration of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the <hi>Worms,</hi> there ought to be due Intermiſſions; leſt being too vigorouſly attack'd, they ſhou'd retire into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>Gut-Colon,</hi> where they wou'd be very much out of the reach of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Gliſters,</hi> they are obſerv'd to be very uſeful, and they are of two general Kinds; Sweet and Bitter.</p>
               <p>The Latter are of great Efficacy againſt the <hi>Aſcarides;</hi> which (as Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0491400600:48"/>are a ſmall, but an almoſt invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Nation; for tho' you ſhou'd waſh away all by one <hi>Gliſter,</hi> yet a new and numberleſs Off-ſpring will quickly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves, being produc'd of the Seed of the former, depoſited in the <hi>Rectum;</hi> ſo that 'twill not be ſufficient to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd the Parents, unleſs their Poſterity be alſo vigorouſly proſecuted and deſtroy'd; this may be done, if after the <hi>Aſcarides</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear, we do not preſently deſiſt, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat theſe bitter Injections for ſome time, once in two or three Days at firſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards once a Week.</p>
               <p>But for the <hi>Teretes,</hi> or long and round <hi>Worms,</hi> theſe bitter Injections are by no Means proper, ſo long as they are brisk, lively and agile, and inclin'd to get up into the Stomach, or ſmall Guts, leſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven upon thoſe Parts, they ſhou'd occaſion a great deal of Miſchief there; but after the Uſe of other Medicines, which have made them Sickly, and thruſt them down, the Exhibition of ſuch <hi>Gliſters</hi> may be very ſeaſonable and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>The ſweet <hi>Gliſters</hi> made of Milk, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are convenient before the Uſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0491400600:49"/>of the Bibber ones, when the <hi>Worms</hi> are lurking in the ſmall Guts, where, by gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tearing the Bowels, they excite violent Pains in the Belly; for the <hi>Worms</hi> take to the Milk, being pleaſant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, and ſo leave off preying on the Bowels, and are alſo entic'd out of their Burrows, and following the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Liquor, are diſpos'd to come away by Stool.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Aethiops Minerable</hi> has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obſer'd to have very happy Effects; Dr. <hi>Harris,</hi> in his Treatiſe of Children's Diſeaſes, relates an extraordinary Cure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by that Medicine, as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>J. P.</hi> A Boy of Thirteen Years of Age, was ſo pin'd away with a <hi>Conſumption</hi> by <hi>Worms,</hi> as it prov'd, that he was more like a <hi>Skelaton,</hi> than a living Perſon; his Eyes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0491400600:53"/>hollow, his Noſe ſharp, and his Bones only cover'd with Skin; he became ſenſeleſs, and ſo weak, that he could ſcarce crawl from one Side of the Room to the other with the Swiftneſs of a <hi>Snail;</hi> all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements by Urine and Stool, fell involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily from him. By taking the foreſaid <hi>Medicine</hi> twice a Day for ſome Time, and gently Purging every fourth Day without <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> he voided a great many <hi>Worms,</hi> and recover'd perfectly well.</p>
                  <p>Such, whoſe Curioſity leads them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more fully after Inſtances of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may conſult the elaborate Works of Dr. <hi>Nicholas Andry,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Daniel Clerc,</hi> who have treated very largely on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

               <hi>AN APPENDIX</hi> Concerning the first Original of <hi>Worms.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT has been already obſerv'd in the preceeding Treatiſe, that even unborn <hi>Infants</hi> are not always free from <hi>Worms,</hi> which <hi>Valliſneri,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Phyſician, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to Account for in the following Manner.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chyle (ſays he)</hi> appointed for the Nouriſhment of the <hi>Infant,</hi> is firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd in the Stomach of the Mother, and render'd more perfect and pure by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and Glands of the Bowels. Now, ſince the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> are the general Seat of <hi>Worms,</hi> and the <hi>Fetus</hi> is for ſeveral Months nouriſh'd by this <hi>Chyle,</hi> the Seeds of <hi>Worms,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0491400600:55"/>which are in the Mother's Bowels, mixing with the Flower of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> are, by the uſual Paſſages, carry'd along to the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,</hi> which involve the <hi>Fetus:</hi> By this Means it may be eaſily gueſs'd how the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant</hi> may receive this Verminous Progeny into its own Bowels. But if it happen, that the Mother be either entirely free, or having <hi>Worms,</hi> they ſhou'd not happen to ſpawn during the Time of her being pregnant, then, indeed, the <hi>Infant</hi> will not be infested with them in this Manner; but if this <hi>Infant</hi> ſhou'd happen to be ſuckl'd by another Woman, who has <hi>Worms,</hi> her Milk may furniſh the Child with a Colony of theſe Inſects, ſince Milk differs not from <hi>Chyle,</hi> and is convey'd from the Bowels to the Breaſts.</p>
            <p>But whence (it may be demanded) have this Mother or Nurſe theſe <hi>Worms,</hi> which they thus communicate to the Child? 'Tis anſwer'd, they have alſo receiv'd them in the Manner aforeſaid; and that they have been ſo convey'd down through all Ages, from the Beginning of the World, and the firſt Parents of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And, indeed, ſince the Seeds of Things, none excepted, were created at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, all Sorts of Inſects,

            <p>At this Rate, 'twill be objected, all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt neceſſarily be poſſeſs'd with theſe Inſects, or elſe their Succeſſion might fail.</p>

But thoſe that in this Man were ſo ſlowly excluded, may be much ſooner in another, even before his Birth, or in his Childhood, or Youth, according as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may favour their Production.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0491400600:59"/>
            <p>Again, in many Perſons they may be never animated; becauſe there may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wanting a ſuitable Diſpoſition of the Humours, or Place to produce them, juſt as the Eggs of the <hi>Vermis Africanus;</hi> for Example, tho' they may be lodg'd in the Skin or Fleſh of every Many, yet this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect troubles none but <hi>Africans, Indians</hi> and <hi>Arabians;</hi> not the Inhabitants of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Climates, becauſe the Heat of <hi>Africa,</hi> or <hi>India,</hi> promotes the Vivification of theſe Eggs, which cannot be animated in colder Countries; as on the other hand the Seeds of the <hi>Taenia,</hi> by Reaſon of the Moiſture of the Climate, are render'd fruitful amongſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which in <hi>India</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> becauſe of the extream Drineſs of thoſe Regions, are unprolifick.</p>
            <p>This Notion is confirm'd by the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Hemmerſam,</hi> who ſpeaking of the <hi>Vermis Africanus,</hi> ſays, 'tis worth noting, that thoſe, who only ſail by <hi>Guiney,</hi> feel an Itching in the Skin, chiefly in that of the Arms and Legs; but moſt commonly in the Thighs: This Itching certainly indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the beginning Motion of the <hi>Vermis Africanus,</hi> excited by the Heat of that Country.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0491400600:60"/>
            <p>Every one knows, how much Heat, and the Fermentation of Juices, conduces to the Production of Animals.</p>
            <p>Neither is the ſeeming Uſeleſsneſs of ſo many Seeds, conſequent upon this Notion, any juſt Objection, when the ſame may be ſaid of many other Seeds, whereof the much greater Part is often loſt; and that Loſs not to be accounted of, if we conſider their infinite Number.</p>
            <p>Nor, laſtly, ought we to object the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten long Continuance of theſe Eggs in the Body, before they are vivify'd; for as much as the Seeds of ſeveral Plants kept many Years, and afterwards committed to the Earth, do germinate as readily as if they had been freſh; and the <hi>Ova</hi> of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men advanc'd in Years, are often equally prolifick with thoſe of younger Women.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Worms,</hi> then (may the Objector further argue) were created by God in the Body of <hi>Adam,</hi> either before his Fall, or afterwards; but if we conſider Man as he was firſt created, perfectly Innocent, it ſeems not probable, that the juſt and good God would implant ſuch foul Vermine in his immaculate Body. And beſides, as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0491400600:61"/>that State of Innocence was entirely free from all manner of Diſeaſes, and poſſeſs'd of a perfect Happineſs, undiſturb'd by any Diſorder of Body, it were impoſſible he ſhould have any <hi>Worms</hi> in his Bowels; which we find, by daily Experience, are the Cauſes of innumerable Diſorders; and even of Death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Nor can it eaſily be imagin'd, how this filthy Inſect, hatch'd, and nouriſh'd in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, could ſuit with that ſweet man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living, directed by the Light of pure Reaſon, void of all Intemperance, and its Conſequences; which produce that putrid Humour, proper to receive, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Eggs of <hi>Worms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To have Recourſe to the Divine Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That God foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtacy of his Creature, prepar'd for his Puniſhment, would be very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, ſince the Suffering ſhould by no means preceed the Offence.</p>
            <p>If on the other hand we ſay, that theſe <hi>Worms</hi> were form'd after the Alteration of his Nature, by his Diſobedience to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command, the Difficulty will be yet greater; for then 'twill follow, that God began a new Creation, which is contrary
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0491400600:62"/>to the Tenour of the ſacred Scriptures, which inform us that God, before he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man, produc'd all other Creatures; not excepting Inſects.</p>
            <p>To remove theſe Objections, 'tis aſſerted, That before Man's Formation, all other Animals, Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were created; and that Man was laſt form'd out of the Mud.</p>
            <p>That in this Mud, thoſe <hi>Worms,</hi> which were a little before created, were implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo enter'd in the Compoſition of his Body, being probably deſign'd by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whilſt he continu'd Innocent, to be very uſeful to him, and to contribute to the Perfection of his Body; and, ſhould he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lapſe from his Integrity, become a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to him.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' this may ſeem ſtrange, that <hi>Worms</hi> ſhould any way conduce to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Perfection of our Bodies, yet let us conſider.</p>
            <p>That thoſe <hi>Machines,</hi> which are ſelf-moving, as Watches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd more Perfect and Surprizing, the more they comprehend other <hi>Machines,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Curious, within their Structure. And
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0491400600:63"/>is not the World accounted more Perfect, by containing ſuch an infinite Variety of Animals, great and ſmall, honourable and baſe, as they are call'd; if any of its Countries prove deſtitute of Inhabitants, are they not accounted unhappy, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable? Why ſhould not, then, our little World be eſteem'd more compleat, by being furniſh'd with its proper Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants?</p>
            <p>Nor would it be any Injury to our firſt Parent, to ſuppoſe his Body the Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of various and wonderful Inſects, which, whilſt he continu'd Innocent, were ſo far from being Pernicious to him, that they render'd him more Perfect, and redounded to his Honour. They liv'd quietly, and amicably with him, and ſed on the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of indigeſted Food only; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not their juſt Limits, they abſtain'd from preying on the Bowels, and did no Injury to the Walls of their Incloſures, but gently licking and cleanſing their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; they gratefully requited the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their Reception: Moreover, if the Fibres of the Bowels were at any time become torpid, or oppreſs'd with too copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or excrementitious Juices, which might be detrimental to the Body; theſe might excite them to the brisker Diſcharge of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0491400600:64"/>their Functions; in ſhort, they might be no ways Noxious, but very Beneficial.</p>
            <p>But this Felicity of <hi>Adam</hi> prov'd but ſhort; for by Rebelling againſt his Maker, the Natures of all Things were ſoon chang'd; and then theſe <hi>Worms</hi> alſo became the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Divine Vengeance, as well as <hi>Lyons, Tigers, Serpents,</hi> and other deſtructive Animals.</p>
