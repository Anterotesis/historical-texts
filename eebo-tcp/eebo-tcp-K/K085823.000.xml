            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I am gradually ſtepping into the eternal ſtate, to appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to beſeech you, as you wiſh to promote his honour, and the eternal ſalvation of your own and your hearers' ſouls,</p>
            <p n="1">1. See that ye be REAL CHRISTIANS yourſelves. I now more and more ſee, that nothing leſs than REAL, REAL Chriſtianity is fit to die with, and make an appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Are ye then indeed <hi>born again, born from above, born of the Spirit? created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works? —new creatures in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> having <hi>all old things paſſed away, and all things become new?</hi> Are ye indeed the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion which <hi>worſhip God in the Spirit,</hi> habitually read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, meditating, praying, preaching, converſing with your hearts, under the influence of the Holy Ghoſt? Have you no <hi>confidence in the fleſh,</hi> no confidence in your ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, your learning, your addreſs, your care and diligence, your gifts and graces;—but being emptied of ſelf, in every form, are <hi>poor in ſpirit, leſs than the leaſt of all ſaints,</hi> and the leaſt of all God's mercies; nay, the very <hi>chief of ſinners</hi> in your own fight? Hath it pleaſed God <hi>to reveal his Son in</hi> you? and to inſtruct you with a ſtrong hand, to count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt as your Lord, and to count them but dung, that you may win him and be found in him, not having your own righteouſneſs, but the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith,—and to know the power of his reſurrection, and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0935100900:3"/>
fellowſhip of his ſufferings,—and to preſs toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus. If you be, or become, <hi>graceleſs</hi> preachers or miniſters of the goſpel, how terrible is your condition! If you open your Bible, the ſentence of your redoubled damnation flaſheth into your conſcience from every page. If you compoſe your ſermon, you but draw up a tremendous indictment againſt yourſelves. If you argue againſt, or reprove other men's ſins, you but aggravate your own. If you publiſh the holy law of God, you but add to your rebellion againſt it, and make it an awful witneſs againſt your treacherous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. If you announce its threatenings, and mention <hi>hell</hi> with all its inſupportable torments, you but infeoff yourſelves in it, and ſerve yourſelves heirs to it as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance appointed you by the Almighty. If you ſpeak of Chriſt and his excellencies, fulneſs, love, and labours, it is but to trample him under your feet. If you take his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and goſpel into your mouth, it is but to profane them, and caſt them forth to be trodden under foot of men. If you talk of ſpiritual experiences, you do but deſpite to the Spirit of grace. If you commend Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and invite ſinners to new-covenant fellowſhip with them, you but treacherouſly ſtab them under the fifth rib, and betray them with a kiſs, and from your heart cry, This is the heir, the God, come let us kill him. While you hold up the glaſs of God's law or goſpel to others, you turn its back to yourſelves. The goſpel, which ye preach to others, is hid,—is a ſavour of death unto death to you, the vail re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on your hearts, and the God of this world having blinded your minds.—Without the ſaving, the heart-trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming knowledge of Chriſt and him crucified, all your knowledge is but an accurſed <hi>puffer up,</hi> and murderer of your own ſouls. And, unleſs the grace of God make <hi>an uncommon ſtretch</hi> to ſave you, how deſperate is your condition! Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no perſon under heaven bids more unlikely to be ſaved, than a <hi>graceleſs miniſter</hi>;—his conſcience is ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with guilt, ſo ſeared as with an hot iron, and his heart ſo hardened by the abuſe of the goſpel.—Alas! my dear pupils, muſt all my inſtructions, all the ſtrivings of the Holy Ghoſt, all your reading, all your meditations, all your ſermons, all your evangelical principles, all your profeſſion, all your prayers, as traps and ſnares, take and bind any of you hand and foot, that you may be caſt, as <hi>unprofitable ſervants,</hi> into <hi>utter darkneſs,</hi> with all the contents of your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0935100900:4"/>
Bible and other books,—all your gifts and apparent-like graces, as it were, inlaid in your conſcienes, that, as fewel or oil, they may for ever feed, or enrage the flames of God's wrath upon your ſouls! After being ſet for a time at the gate of heaven, to point others into it,—after propheſying in Chriſt's name, and waſting yourſelves to ſhew others the way of ſalvation, and to light up the friends of our Redeemer to their heavenly reſt,—muſt your own lamp go out in everlaſting darkneſs, and ye be bidden, <hi>Depart from me, I never knew you, ye workers of iniquity?</hi>—Muſt I, muſt all the churches behold you at laſt brought forth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as arch-traitors to our Redeemer? Muſt you, for ever, in the moſt tremendous manner, ſink into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, under the weight of the blood of the great God our Saviour,—under the weight of murdered truths, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered convictions, murdered gifts, murdered miniſtrations of the goſpel, and murdered ſouls of men!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Ponder much, as before God, what proper FURNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE you have for the miniſterial work, and labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it. To him that hath ſhall be given. Hath Jeſus beſtowed on you the Holy Ghoſt? What diſtinct knowledge have you of the myſteries of the kingdom? What aptneſs have you to teach, bringing out of the good treaſure of your own heart, <hi>things new and old?</hi> What ability to make the deep myſteries of the goſpel plain to perſons of weak capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and to repreſent things delightful or terrible, in a proper and affecting manner? What proper quickneſs in conceiving of divine things; and what rooted inclination to ſtudy them, as perſons devoted to matters of infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance? What peculiar fitneſs have you for the pulpit, qualifying you, in a plain, ſerious, orderly and earneſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to ſcrew the truths of God into the conſciences of your hearers? With what ſtock of ſelf-experienced truths and texts of inſpiration did, or do you enter on the miniſterial work? Of what truths, relative to the law of God,—or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to ſin, Satan, or the deſertions and terrors of God, hath your ſoul not only ſeen the evidence, but felt the power? What declarations, promiſes, offers and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, of the glorious goſpel, have ye, with joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing of heart, found and eaten, and therein taſted and ſeen that God is good? Of what inſpired truths and texts can you ſay, <hi>Even ſo we have believed, and therefore we ſpeak:</hi> what we have ſeen and heard with the Father, and taſted and handled of the word of life, that we declare unto you.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0935100900:5"/>
Thrice happy preacher, whoſe deeply experienced heart is, next to his Bible, his principal note-book!</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take heed that your CALL from Chriſt and his Spirit to your miniſterial work be not only REAL but EVIDENT. Without this you can neither be duly excited or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to your work; nor hope, nor pray for divine ſucceſs in it; nor bear up aright under the difficulties you muſt encounter, if you attempt to be faithful. If you run unſent by Jeſus Chriſt and his Spirit, notwithſtanding the utmoſt external regularity in your licence, call and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you, in the whole of your miniſtrations, muſt act the part of a ſacrilegious thief and robber, a pretended and treacherous ambaſſador to Chriſt and his Father, and a murderer of men's ſouls, not profiting them at all. What direction,—what ſupport,—what aſſiſtance,—what encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,—what reward, can you then expect? Ponder, therefore, as before God: Have you taken this honour to yourſelves? or, Were ye called of God as was Aaron? Hath Jeſus Chriſt ſent you to preach the goſpel, and laid upon you a delightful and awful <hi>neceſſity</hi> to preach it? While he powerfully determined you to follow providence, and avoid every ſelfiſh and irregular ſtep towards entrance into the office, as a mean of <hi>eating a piece of bread,</hi> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying carnal eaſe and honour, did he breathe on you, and cauſe you to receive the Holy Ghoſt,—filling you with deep compaſſion to the periſhing ſouls of men, and a deep ſenſe of your own unfitneſs for ſuch arduous work, and fervent deſire, that if the Lord were willing to uſe you as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of winning ſouls, he would ſanctify you, and make you meet for his work?—Perhaps, providentially ſhut out from other callings, to which you or your parents inclined, did you, in your education, go up <hi>bound in the Spirit</hi> by the love of Chriſt burning in your hearts, and conſtraining you cheerfully to ſurrender yourſelves to poverty, reproach, and hatred of men, for promoting his name and honour, and the ſalvation of men in the world?—What oracles of God, powerfully impreſſed on your ſoul, have directed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged you to his work?—Know you in what form Jeſus Chriſt gave you your commiſſion? Whether to <hi>open the eyes of the Gentiles, and turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,—that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins and an inheritance among them who are ſanctified by faith</hi> in him?—Or, to <hi>go make the heart of this people fat, their ears heavy,</hi> and to <hi>ſhut their eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. See that your END in entering into, or executing your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0935100900:6"/>
office, be ſingle and diſintereſted. Dare you appeal to him, whoſe eyes are <hi>as a flame of fire,</hi> and who <hi>ſearcheth the hearts and trieth the reins,</hi> to give to every man according to his works, that you never inclined to be put into the prieſt's office, that you might <hi>eat a piece of bread, and look every one for his gain from his quarter;</hi> that ye <hi>ſeek not great things for yourſelves</hi>; that ye <hi>covet no man's ſilver, gold,</hi> or <hi>apparel;</hi> that ye ſeek not men's property, but <hi>themſelves,</hi> that you may win them to Chriſt for their eternal welfare; that ye ſeek not your own honour, eaſe, or temporal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but the things of Chriſt and his people; that ye <hi>ſeek not honour,</hi> or <hi>glory of men,</hi> but the honour of Chriſt and his Father, in the eternal ſalvation of ſouls; and have determined to proſecute this end through whatever diſtreſs or danger the Lord may be pleaſed to lay in your way?</p>
            <p n="5">5. See that your minds be deeply impreſſed with the NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE, EXTENT, and IMPORTANCE of your miniſterial work,—that therein it is required of you, as <hi>ambaſſadors for Chriſt,</hi>—as <hi>ſtewards</hi> of the myſteries and manifold grace of God,—<hi>to be faithful;</hi> to ſerve the Lord with your ſpirit, and with much humility in the goſpel of his Son: to teſtify repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, not keeping back or ſhunning to declare every part of the counſel of God,—or any profitable inſtruction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, or encouragement; and not moved with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, perſecution, hunger or nakedneſs,—to be ready, not only to be bound, but to die for the name of the Lord Jeſus, in order to finiſh your courſe with joy. Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the infirmities of the weak, and ſtriving toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in prayer, that the word of the Lord may have free courſe, and be glorified, and your meſſages provided by God and made acceptable to your hearers, you muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with much fear and trembling, determined to know, to glory in, and make known, nothing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,—preaching the goſpel <hi>not with enticing words of man's wiſdom,</hi> as men-pleaſers, but with great plainneſs of ſpeech, in demonſtration of the Spirit and with power— ſpeaking the things which are freely given you by God, not in the words which man's wiſdom teacheth, but in <hi>words which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth,</hi> comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual,—as having the mind of Chriſt, always triumphing in HIM,—and making manifeſt the ſavour of the knowledge of him in every place, that you may be a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt in them who are ſaved, and in them who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0935100900:7"/>
periſh;—as of ſincerity, as of God, in the ſight of God, ſpeaking in Chriſt, and through the mercy of God, not fainting, but renouncing the hidden things of diſhoneſty;— not walking in craftineſs, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, or corrupting the truth, but manifeſting the truth to every man's conſcience, as in the ſight of God;— not preaching yourſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſervants to the church for his ſake, always bearing about his dying, that his life may be minifeſted in you;—and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the terror of the Lord, and deeply impreſſed with the account which you and your hearers muſt give to him of your whole conduct, in the day of judgment,—awed by his infinite authority, and conſtrained and enflamed by his love, you muſt perſuade men, beſeeching them to be reconciled unto God, and making yourſelves manifeſt to God and to their conſcience,—and, as their edification requires, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your voice, and turning yourſelves every way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming all things to all men, in order to gain them to Chriſt,—jealous over them with a godly jealouſy, in order to eſpouſe them to him, as chaſte virgins,—travailing in Birth, till he be formed in their hearts. You muſt take heed to your miniſtry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfil it;—ſtir up the gifts which were given you,—give yourſelves wholly to reading, exhortations, and doctrine;—and take heed to yourſelves and to the doctrine which you preach, that you may ſave yourſelves and them that hear you;—watching for their ſouls, as they who do and muſt give an account for them to God,—rightly divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of truth, and giving every man his portion in due ſeaſon, faithfully warning every man with tears, night and day, teaching every man, particularly <hi>young ones,</hi> and labouring to preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,— and warring, not after the fleſh, nor with carnal weapons, but with ſuch as are mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds and caſting down imaginations, and ſubduing every thought and affection to the obedience of Chriſt. Having him for the end of your converſation, and holding faſt the form of ſound words in faith in, and love to him,—not entangling yourſelves with the affairs of this life, nor aſhamed of the Lord or of his cauſe or priſoners, but ready to endure hardſhips as good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, ye muſt go forth without the camp, bearing his reproach, and, expoſed as ſpectacles of ſufferings to angels and men, muſt not faint under your tribulations, but feed the flock of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0935100900:8"/>
God which he hath purchaſed with his own blood, and over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers,— preaching the word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, reproving, rebuking and exhorting with all long-ſuffering and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,—taking the overſight of your people, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre of worldly gain, or larger ſtipends, but of a ready mind,—neither as being lords over God's heritage, but as examples to the flock,— exerciſing yourſelves to have a conſcience void of offence towards God and towards man,—having a good conſcience willing in all things to live honeſtly,—exerciſed to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,—kindly affectioned, diſintereſted, holy, juſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable,—prudent examples of the believers in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, in charity, in faith and purity,—fleeing youthful luſts and following after righteouſneſs, peace, faith, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,—not ſtriving, but being gentle unto all men,—in meekneſs inſtructing them who oppoſe themſelves,— avoiding fooliſh and unlearned queſtions,—and old wives fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,—fleeing from perverſe diſputings and worldly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, as moſt dangerous ſnares; and following after righteouſneſs, godlineſs, faith, love, patience, meekneſs;— fighting the good fight of faith, and laying hold on eternal life,—keeping your truſt of goſpel truth and miniſterial office, and without partiality or precipitancy, committing the ſame to faithful men, who may be able to teach others;—and, in fine, faithfully labouring, in the Lord, to try, and confute, and cenſure falſe teachers, publicly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, or excommunicate open tranſgreſſors, reſtore ſuch as have been overtaken in a fault in the ſpirit of meekneſs,— and having compaſſion on them, to pull them out of the fire, hating even the garment ſpotted by the fleſh, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conniving at, or partaking with any in their ſins. Who is ſufficient for theſe things? May your ſufficincy be of God; and as your days are, ſo may your ſtrength be.</p>
            <p n="6">6. See that ye take heed to your ſpirits, that ye deal not TREACHEROUSLY with the Lord. In approaching to, or executing the miniſterial office, keep your hearts with all diligence; for out of it are the iſſues of eternal life or death to yourſelves and others. Building up yourſelves on your moſt holy faith, and praying in the Holy Ghoſt, keep your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto the eternal life. If you do not <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> love Chriſt, how can you <hi>faithfully</hi> and <hi>diligently</hi> feed his lambs—his ſheep? Alas! how many precious

ſermons, exhortations and inſtructions are quite marred and poiſoned by coming through the cold, carnal, and careleſs heart of the preacher, and being attended with his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, untender, and lukewarm life? If you have not a deep-felt experience of the terrors of the Lord,—of the bitterneſs of ſin, vanity of this world, and importance of eternity,—and of the conſcience quieting and heart-capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating virtue of Jeſus' bleeding love, how can you be duly ſerious and hearty in preaching the goſpel? If, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by a predominate love to Chriſt, your heart be not fixed on everlaſting things, and powerfully animated to an eager following of peace and holineſs, how can you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the moſt abominable treachery, declare to men their chief happineſs, and the true method of obtaining it? If your graces be not kept lively, your loins girt, and your lamps burning, all enkindled by the heart-conſtraining love of Chriſt, how cold, carnal and blaſted muſt be your ſacred miniſtrations? If your work, as ambaſſadors of Chriſt, be to tranſact matters of everlaſting importance between an infinite God and immortal, but periſhing, ſouls of men; if the honours and privileges of it be ſo invaluable, what inexpreſſible need have you of habitual dependence on Chriſt by a lively faith? What ſelf-denial, what ardent love to Chriſt and his Father, what diſintereſted regard to his honour, what compaſſion to ſouls, what prudence, what faithfulneſs and diligence, what humility and holy zeal, what ſpirituality of mind and converſation, what order, what plainneſs, what fervour, what juſt temperature of mildneſs, and ſeverity;—is neceſſary in every part of it!—If, while you miniſter in holy things, your luſts prevail and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, you have leſs of real or lively Chiſtianity than the moſt weak and uncircumſpect ſaints under your charge;— if your evil heart of unblief fearfully carry you off from the living God, and you can live unconcerned while the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſanctifying preſence of God is withheld from your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or your flocks,—how ſad is your and their caſe!— If your indwelling pride be allowed to chooſe your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, your dreſs, your victuals,—nay, your text, your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, your order, your language;—if it be allowed to indite your thoughts, and, to the reproach and blaſting of the goſpel of Chriſt, to deck your ſermon with tawdry orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and fancies, as if it were a ſtage play, and to blunt and muffle up its ſharp arrows with ſilken ſmoothneſs and ſwollen bombaſt;—if it be allowed to kindle your fervour,

and form your looks, your tone, your action;—or to render you enraptured or ſelf-conceited, becauſe of ſubſequent applauſe;—or ſad and provoked, becauſe your labours are contemned, how dreadful is your danger and that of your hearers! How can miniſterial labours originating in pride, ſpurred on by the fame of learning, diligence or holineſs, —hurt the intereſts of Satan, from whoſe influence they proceed?—If pride be allowed to cauſe you to envy or wound the characters of ſuch as differ from, or outſhine you, or to make you reluctant to Chriſtian reproof from your inferiors, how fearful is your guilt and danger! Pride indulged is no more conſiſtent with a Chriſtian character, than drunkenneſs and whoredom.—If you take up or cleave to any principle or practice in religion, in the way of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contention, how abominable to God is the <hi>ſower of diſcord among brethren!</hi> If you undervalue the peace and proſperity of the church of Chriſt, and are not afflicted with her in all her afflictons, how cruel and unchriſt-like your conduct! If, in juſtly proving your opponent deceivers and blaſphemers, you, by your angry manner, plead the cauſe of the devil, will God accept it as an offering at your hands? If you are ſlothful in ſtudying or declaring the truths of Chriſt,—if to ſave labour or expence, you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active or averſe to help ſuch as have no fixed miniſtrations, or to contrive or proſecute projects for advancing the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, and promoting the ſalvation of men, how great is your baſeneſs, and fearful your hazard!——Think, as before God, did Jeſus Chriſt furniſh you for, and put you into the miniſtry, that you might idle away, or proſtitute your devoted time, tear his church, conceal or mangle his truths, betray his intereſts, or ſtarve and murder the ſouls of men? Are not your people the <hi>flock of God, which he purchaſed with his own blood?</hi> Will you then dare to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his peculiar property and portion, and attempt to fruſtrate the end of his death? Did Jeſus die for men's ſouls? And will you grudge a ſmall labour or expence to promote his honour in their eternal ſalvation? If the Son of God was crucified for men,—crucified for you, will you refuſe, through his Spirit, to crucify your ſelfiſhneſs, your pride, your ſloth, your worldly and covetous diſpoſition, in order to ſave yourſelves and them that hear you.—While your own ſalvation and the ſalvation of mulitudes are ſo deeply connected with your faithfulneſs and diligence,— while the powers of hell and earth to ſet themſelves in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

to your work, that, in your falls, they may triumph over Chriſt, your Maſter, and his church,—while ſo many eyes of God, angels and men, are upon you, why do you ever think or ſpeak of eternal things, of heaven and hell, of Jeſus's perſon, offices, righteouſneſs, love and free ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the moſt ſerious and deep impreſſion of their importance? While, perhaps, you preach your laſt ſermon, and have before you, and on every hand of you, hundreds or ſcores of periſhing ſouls, ſuſpended over hell by the frail thread of mortal life, not knowing what a day or hour may bring forth,—ſouls already in the hands of the devil, and, as it were, juſt departing to be with him in the lake which burns with fire and brimſtone,—ſouls already ſlain by the goſpel of our ſalvation blaſted and curſed to them, partly by your means, why do not tears of deep concern mingle themſelves with every point you ſtudy, every ſentence you publiſh in the name of Chriſt?—When multitudes of your hearers, ſome of them never to hear you more, and juſt leaping off into the depths of hell, are, in reſpect of their needs, crying with an exceeding bitter cry, <hi>Miniſter, help, help, we periſh,—we utterly periſh,—pluck the brand out of the burning fiery furnace,</hi>—why ſpend your devoted time in idle viſits, unedifying converſe, uſeleſs reading, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary ſleep?—What, if while you are ſo employed, ſome of your hearers drop into eternal flames, and begin their everlaſting curſing of you for not doing more to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their ſalvation? When Jeſus ariſeth to require their blood at your hand, how accurſed will appear that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which was not improven for his honour who beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it! that eaſe, which iſſued in the damnation of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes! that conformity to the world which permitted, or that unedifying converſe which encouraged your hearers to ſleep into hell in their ſins!—that pride or luxury which reſtrained your charity, or diſgracefully plunged you into debt!—Since, my dear pupils, all the truths of God, all the ordinances and privileges of his church,—the eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of multitudes, and the infinitely precious honour of Jeſus Chriſt and his Father, as connected with <hi>the preſent and future ages</hi> of time, are intruſted to you, how neceſſary, that, like Jeſus, your Maſter, you ſhould be faithful in all things to him who appointed you?—If you do the work of our Lord deceitfully,—in what tremendous manner ſhall your parents, who devoted and educated you for it,—your teachers who prepared you for it, the ſeminaries of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p n="7">7. See that ye, as workmen who need not be aſhamed, earneſtly labour RIGHTLY TO DIVIDE the word of truth, according to the capacities, needs, and particular occaſions of your hearers, giving every one of them their portion in due ſeaſon. Never make your own caſe, your inclination or honour, but the need of ſouls, and the glory of Chriſt, the regulator of your choice of ſubjects. Labour chiefly on the principal points of religion. To bring down the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental myſteries of the goſpel to the capacities of your hearers, and inculcate on their conſciences the great points of union and fellowſhip with Chriſt, regeneration, juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſanctification, will require all your grace, learning and labour. Never aim at tickling the ears or pleaſing the fancies of your hearers, but at convincing their conſciences, enlightening their minds, attracting their affections, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing their wills, that they may be perſuaded and enabled to embrace and improve Jeſus Chriſt as freely offered to them in the goſpel, for wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and redemption. Labour to preach the law as a broken covenant,—the goſpel of ſalvation,—and the law as a rule of life,—not only in their extenſive matter, but alſo in their proper order and connexion. It is only when they are properly connected, that the precious truths of God appear in their true luſtre and glory. It is at your infinite hazard, and the infinite hazard of them that hear you, if you even by negligence, either blend or put aſunder
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0935100900:13"/>
that law and goſpel which Jeſus Chriſt hath ſo delightfully joined together. No where is it more neceſſary to take heed, than in preaching up the <hi>duties of holineſs.</hi> Let all be founded in union to and communion with Chriſt, all enforced by the pattern, love, righteouſneſs and benefits of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. You have ſtated yourſelves public witneſſes for Jeſus Chriſt, who profeſs to adhere to, and propagate his <hi>injured truths,</hi>—and to commemorate with thankfulneſs the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable mercies,</hi> which he hath beſtowed on our church and nation,—and to teſtify againſt, and mourn over our own and our father's <hi>fearful backſlidings</hi> from that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted work of reformation once attained in our land. See that ye be judicious, upright, conſtant and faithful in your profeſſion. I now approach death heartily ſatisfied with our excellent Weſtminſter <hi>Confeſſion of Faith, Catechiſms,</hi> and <hi>Form of church-government,</hi>—and cordially adhering to theſe <hi>Covenants,</hi> by which our fathers ſolemnly bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their poſterity to profeſs the doctrines and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the duties therein contained. I look upon the Seceſſion as indeed the cauſe of God, but ſadly miſmanaged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by myſelf and others. Alas! for that pride, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſelfiſhneſs, and unconcern for the glory of Chriſt, and ſpiritual edification of ſouls, which hath ſo often prevailed! —Alas! for our want of due meekneſs, gentleneſs, holy zeal, ſelf-denial, hearty grief for ſin, compaſſion to ſouls in immediate connexion with us, or left in the eſtabliſhed church which became diſtinguiſhed witneſſes for Chriſt. Alas! that we did not chiefly ſtrive to <hi>pray better, preach better,</hi> and <hi>live better</hi> than our neighbours.—Study to ſee every thing with your own eyes, but never indulge an itch after novelties: moſt of thoſe, which are now eſteemed ſuch, are nothing but <hi>old errors,</hi> which were long ago juſtly refuted, varniſhed over with ſome new expreſſions. Never, by your peeviſhneſs, contentions, eagerneſs about worldly things, or the like, make others think lightly of the cauſe of God among your hands. If I miſtake not, the churches are entering into a fearful cloud of apoſtacy and trouble. But he that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved. Be ye faithful unto the death, and Chriſt ſhall give you a crown of life. But if any man draw back, God's ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</p>

I will open rivers in high places. Fear not; for I am with thee, be not diſmayed, for I am thy God. I will ſtrengthen thee: Yea, I will help thee: I will uphold thee the right hand of my righteouſneſs. Fear not, worm Jacob, —I will help thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer. I will wake thee a new ſharp threſhing inſtrument,—and thou ſhalt threſh the mountains. My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee: for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs. As thy days are, ſo ſhall thy ſtrength be.</hi>—If your troubles be many, he hath ſaid, <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters I will be with thee:—the rivers ſhall not overflow thee: When thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, nor ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi>—If your incomes be ſmall and pinching, <hi>Ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for our ſakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.

I will ſatiate the ſoul of her prieſts with fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> A ſalary of remarkable fellowſhip with Chriſt and of ſucceſs in winning ſouls is the moſt delightful and enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—If your labours appear to have little ſucceſs, be the more diligent and dependent on Chriſt. Never <hi>mourn as they that have no hope.</hi> Let not <hi>the eunuch ſay, I am a dry tree.</hi> Jeſus hath ſaid, <hi>I will pour water on him that is thirſty, and floods on the dry ground.

The kingdoms of this world ſhall become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Chriſt.</hi> Believe it on the teſtimony of God himſelf: believe it on the teſtimony of all his faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and, if mine were of any avail, I ſhould add it, that there is no Maſter ſo kind as Chriſt; no ſervice ſo pleaſant and profitable as that of Chriſt; and no reward ſo full, ſatisfying and permanent as that of Chriſt.
