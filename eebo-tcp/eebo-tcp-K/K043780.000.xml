            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS
Humbly Offer'd
By the Company exerciſing the
Trade and Miſtery of UPHOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS,
againſt Part of the
BILL, <hi>For the better Viewing,
Searching and Examining Drugs,
Medicines, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEING call'd upon by ſeveral Retailers
and Diſpenſers of Drugs and Medicines
about Town, to uſe our Endeavours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Bill now depending, <hi>for Viewing,</hi> &amp;c.
In Regard of our common Intereſt and in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to the ſaid Retailers and Diſpenſers of
Medicines (which we have always found to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0135202200:4"/>
very effectual) we preſume to lay the following
Reaſons before the Publick, againſt the ſaid Bill.</p>
            <p>That the Company of Upholders <hi>are far
from being averſe to the giving of Drugs and
Medicines in general,</hi> provided they may be of
ſuch Qualities as we require, and adminiſter'd
by ſuch Perſons in whom our Company juſtly
repoſe the greateſt Confidence: And provided
they tend to the Encouragement of Trade, and
the Conſumption of the Woolen Manufacture
of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We beg Leave to obſerve, that <hi>there hath
been no Complaint from any of the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Citizens whom we have attended.</hi> Our
Practice, which conſiſts chiefly in outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
having been always ſo effectual, that
none of our Patients have been oblig'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
a ſecond Operation. Excepting one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman;
who, after her firſt Burial, having,
burthen'd her Husband with a new Brood of
poſthumous Children, her ſecond Funeral was
by us perform'd without any further Charges to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0135202200:5"/>
the ſaid Husband of the deceas'd. And we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
hope, that one ſingle Inſtance of this Kind
(a Misfortune owing meerly to the Avarice of
a Sexton in cutting off a Ring) will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
to any Want of Skill, or Care in our
Company.</p>
            <p>We humbly conceive, that this <hi>Power, by
this Bill lodged in the Cenſors of the College of
Phyſicians,</hi> to reſtrain any of His Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from diſpenſing, and well-diſpoſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
from taking what Medicines they pleaſe, <hi>is
a manifeſt Encroachment on the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Company exerciſing the Trade and
Miſtery of Upholders, have an undiſputed Right
in and upon the Bodies of all and every the
Subjects of the Kingdom; we conceive the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of this Bill, though not abſolutely depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them of their ſaid Right, might keep them
out of Poſſeſſion by unreaſonable Delays, to the
great Detriment of our Company and their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Families.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0135202200:6"/>
We hope it will be conſider'd that there are
Multitudes of neceſſitous Heirs and penurious
Parents, Perſons in pinching Circumſtances,
with numerous Families of Children, Wives that
have lived long, many robuſt aged Women
with great Jointures, elder Brothers with bad
Underſtandings, ſingle Heirs of great Eſtates,
whereby the Collateral Line are for ever exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
Reverſionary Patents, and Reverſionary
Promiſes of Preferments, Leaſes upon Single
Lives, and Play-debts upon joint Lives, and
that the Perſons ſo agrieved have no Hope of
being ſpeedily relieved any other Way, than by
the diſpenſing of Drugs and Medicines in the
Manner they now are; Burying alive being
judg'd repugnant to the know Laws of this
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That there are many of the Deceaſed, who
by certain mechanical Motions and Powers are
carried about Town, who would have been put
into our Hands long before this Time by any
other well-ordered Government; by want of a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0135202200:7"/>
due Police in this Particular, our Company
have been great Sufferers.</p>
            <p>That frequent Funerals contribute to preſerve
the Genealogies of Families, and the Honours
conferred by the Crown, (which are no where
ſo well illuſtrated as on this ſolemn Occaſion;)
to maintain neceſſitous Clergy, to enable the
Clerks to appear in decent Habits to officiate
on <hi>Sundays,</hi> to feed the great Retinue of ſober
and melancholy Men who appear at the ſaid
Funerals, and who muſt ſtarve without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and regular Employment. Moreover we
deſire it may be remember'd, that by the paſſing
of this Bill the Nobility and Gentry will have
their old Coaches lie upon their Hands, which
are now employed by our Company.</p>
            <p>And we further hope that frequent Funerals
will not be diſcouraged (as is by this Bill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed)
it being the only Method left of <hi>carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
ſome People to Church.</p>
            <p>We are afraid that by the Hardſhips of this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0135202200:8"/>
Bill our Company will be reduced to leave
their Buſineſs here, and <hi>practiſe at</hi> York <hi>and</hi>
Briſtol, <hi>where the free Uſe of bad Medicines
will be ſtill allowed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is therefore hoped that no ſpecious Pretence
whatſoever will be thought ſufficient to introduce
an Arbitrary and unlimited Power for People to
live</hi> (in Defiance of Art) as long as they can
by the Courſe of Nature, to the Prejudice of
our Company, and the Decay of Trade.</p>
            <p>That as our Company are like to ſuffer in
ſome meaſure by the Power given to Phyſicians
to diſſect the Bodies of Malefactors, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
hope that the Manufacture of Caſes for
Skeletons will be reſerved ſolely to the Coffin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers.</p>
            <p>We likewiſe humbly preſume that the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of the ſeveral Trades and Profeſſions which
depend upon ours, may be regarded; ſuch as
that of the Makers of Hearſes, Coaches, Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins,
Epitaphs, and Bell-ropes; Stone-cutters,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0135202200:9"/>
Feather-men and Bell-ringers; and eſpecially
the Manufacturers of Crapes; and the Makers
of Snuff, who uſe great Quantities of old-Coffins,
and who, conſidered in the Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Drugs, employ by far the greateſt
Number of Hands of any Manufacture of the
Kingdom.</p>
