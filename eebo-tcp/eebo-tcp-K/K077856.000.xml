            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

INVESTIGATION,

            </head>
            <p>AMONG the many cauſes that have been
aſſigned of the preſent high price of proviſions,
I am much inclined to ſuſpect, that the principal
one has hitherto eſcaped detection; at leaſt, in
the diſcuſſions on the ſubject, either in print or
converſation, which have fallen within my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the cauſe, which I conceive to have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
moſt ſtrongly towards increaſing the price
of the neceſſaries of life, has not yet been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted.
There are ſome diſorders, which, though
they ſcarcely admit of a cure, or even of any
conſiderable mitigation, are ſtill capable of being
made greatly worſe. In ſuch misfortunes it is of
great importance to know the deſperate nature of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0028202200:3"/>
the diſeaſe. The next ſtep to the alleviation
of pain, is the bearing it with compoſure, and
not aggravating it by impatience and irritation.</p>
            <p>It cannot admit of a doubt with perſons of
ſenſe and information, that, during the laſt year,
there was a ſcarcity, to a certain extent, of all
ſorts of grain; but it muſt be at the ſame time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that the price was higher than the
degree of that ſcarcity would at firſt ſight appear
to warrant.</p>
            <p>In the Summer of 1799, in the courſe of a
northern tour, I paſſed through Sweden. There
was at that time a general dearth of corn through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the country, owing to a long drought the
preceding year. In the province of Wurmland,
adjoining to Norway, it approached almoſt to a
famine, and the lower claſſes of people ſuffered
moſt ſevere diſtreſs. At the time we were paſſing
through that part of the country, which was in
July, they were reduced to two moſt miſerable
ſubſtitutes for bread; one, made of the inner bark
of the fir, and the other, of the common ſorrel
dried, and powdered. Theſe ſubſtances, though
made into the uſual ſhape of their rye bread, had
no affinity to it whatever in taſte, and but very
little, I believe, in nouriſhment, as the effects of
this miſerable food were but too viſible in their
pallid and unhealthy countenances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0028202200:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
There could be little doubt, that the degree of
ſcarcity then prevailing in that part of Sweden,
was conſiderably greater than any we have hitherto
experienced here; and yet, as far as we could learn,
the price of rye, which is the grain principally
uſed for bread, had not riſen above double its
uſual average; whereas in this country laſt year,
in a ſcarcity, that muſt be acknowledged to be
very greatly inferior in degree, wheat roſe to
above three times its former price.</p>
            <p>The continuation of extraordinary high prices,
after a harveſt that was at one time looked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to as abundant, has contributed ſtill more
to aſtoniſh and perplex the public mind. Many
men of ſenſe have joined in the univerſal cry of
the common people, that there muſt be roguery
ſomewhere; and the general indignation has fallen
upon monopolizers, foreſtallers, and regraters—words,
that are vented from every mouth with
fearful execrations, and are applied indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
to all middle men whatever, to every kind
of trader that goes between the grower of the
commodity and the conſumer.</p>
            <p>This popular clamour, headed by the Lord
Chief Juſtice, and enforced throughout the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
by the inſtructions of the grand juries, muſt
make every reflecting mind tremble for the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0028202200:5"/>
future ſupply of our markets. I cannot but think,
therefore, that I ſhould do an acceptable ſervice,
if I could ſucceed in accounting for the preſent
high price of the neceſſaries of life, without cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
a claſs of men, who, I believe, have
been accuſed unjuſtly, and who, every political
economiſt muſt know, are abſolutely neceſſary in
the complicated machinery that diſtributes the
proviſions and other commodities of a large
nation.</p>
            <p>I ought firſt to premiſe, however, that I am
not intereſted in this queſtion, further than as a
lover of truth, and a well-wiſher to my country.
I have no ſort of connection whatever with any
of theſe middle men or great farmers, who are
now the objects of public indignation: and, as an
individual with a ſmall fixed income, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
among that claſs of perſons on whom the
high price of proviſions muſt fall the heavieſt.</p>
            <p>To proceed to the point: I am moſt ſtrongly
inclined to ſuſpect, that the attempt in moſt parts
of the kingdom to increaſe the pariſh allowances
in proportion to the price of corn, combined with
the riches of the country, which have enabled it
to proceed as far as it has done in this attempt,
is, comparatively ſpeaking, the ſole cauſe, which
has occaſioned the price of proviſions in this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0028202200:6"/>
country to riſe ſo much higher than the degree
of ſcarcity would ſeem to warrant, ſo much higher
than it would do in any other country where this
cauſe did not operate.</p>
            <p>It may appear, perhaps, at firſt, to the reader,
that this cauſe is inadequate to the effect we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
but, if he will kindly allow me a few
minutes of patient and candid attention, I hope I
ſhall be able to convince him, that it is not only
adequate to produce the preſent high price of
proviſions of which we complain; but, admitting
a real ſcarcity, that the attempt to carry it actually
into execution, might raiſe the quartern loaf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the expiration of a year, to as many ſhillings
as it is now pence.</p>
            <p>Adam Smith has moſt juſtly ſtated, that the
actual price at which a commodity is ſold, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of its natural price, the price at which it
can be brought to market, allowing the uſual
profit in times of moderate plenty, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the ſupply to the demand. When any
commodity is ſcarce, its natural price is neceſſarily
forgotten, and its actual price is regulated by the
exceſs of the demand above the ſupply.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe a commodity in great requeſt
by fifty people, but of which, from ſome failure
in its production, there is only ſufficient to ſupply
forty. If the fortieth man from the top have two
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0028202200:7"/>
ſhillings which he can ſpend in this commodity,
and the thirty-nine above him, more, in various
proportions, and the ten below, all leſs, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
price of the article, according to the genuine
principles of trade, will be two ſhillings. If more
be aſked, the whole will not be ſold, becauſe there
are only forty who have as much as two ſhillings
to ſpend in the article; and there is no reaſon for
aſking leſs, becauſe the whole may be diſpoſed of
at that ſum.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe, now, that ſomebody gives the
ten poor men, who were excluded, a ſhilling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.
The whole fifty can now offer two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
the price which was before aſked. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to every genuine principle of fair trading,
the commodity muſt immediately riſe. If it do
not, I would aſk, upon what principle are ten, out
of the fifty who are all able to offer two ſhillings,
to be rejected? For ſtill, according to the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
there is only enough for forty. The two
ſhillings of a poor man are juſt as good as the two
ſhillings of a rich one; and, if we interfere to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the commodity from riſing out of the reach
of the pooreſt ten, whoever they may be, we muſt
toſs up, draw lots, raffle, or flight, to determine
who are to be excluded. It would be beyond my
preſent purpoſe, to enter into the queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0028202200:8"/>
any of theſe modes would be more eligible,
for the diſtribution of the commodities of a
country, than the ſordid diſtinction of money;
but certainly, according to the cuſtoms of all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized
and enlightened nations, and according to
every acknowledged principle of commercial
dealing, the price muſt be allowed to riſe to that
point which will put it beyond the power of ten
out of the fifty to purchaſe. This point will,
perhaps, be half-a-crown or more, which will
now become the price of the commodity. Let
another ſhilling a-piece be given to the excluded
ten: all will now be able to offer half-a-crown.
The price muſt in conſequence immediately riſe
to three ſhillings or more, and ſo on <hi>toties quoties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the progreſs of this operation the ten ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
would not be always entirely the ſame.
The richeſt of the ten firſt excluded, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be raiſed above the pooreſt of the firſt forty.
Small changes of this kind muſt take place. The
additional allowances to the pooreſt, and the
weight of the high prices on thoſe above them,
would tend to level the two orders; but, till a
complete level had taken place, ten muſt be
always excluded, and the price would always be
fixed, as nearly as poſſible, at that ſum which the
fortieth man at the top could afford to give. This,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0028202200:9"/>
if the donatives were continued, would raiſe the
commodity to an extraordinary price, without
the ſuppoſition of any combination and conſpiracy
among the venders, or any kind of unfair dealing
whatever.</p>
            <p>The riſe in the price of corn, and of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
in this country, has been effected exactly
in the ſame manner, though the operation may be
a little more complicated; and I am firmly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that it never could have reached its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
height, but from the ſyſtem of poor laws and
pariſh allowances, which have operated preciſely
in the ſame mode as the donatives of a ſhilling
in the inſtance I have juſt adduced.</p>
            <p>The harveſt of 1799 was bad, both in quality
and quantity. Few people could deny that there
appeared to be a very conſiderable deficiency of
produce: and the price of the load of wheat roſe
in conſequence almoſt immediately to £. 20. I
returned from the North in the beginning of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,
and found the alarm ſo great and general,
and the price of corn ſo high, that I remember
thinking that it was probably fully adequate to
the degree of the deficiency, and, taking into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
the proſpect of importation from the
very early alarm, that it would not riſe much
higher during the year. In this conjecture, it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0028202200:10"/>
appears that I was much miſtaken; but I have
very little doubt that in any other country equally
rich, yet without the ſyſtem of poor laws and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
allowances, the price would never have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
£.25 the load of wheat; and that this
ſum would have been ſufficiently high to have
excluded ſuch a number of people from their
uſual conſumption, as to make the deficient crop,
with the quantity imported, laſt throughout the
year.</p>
            <p>The ſyſtem of poor laws, and pariſh allowances,
in this country, and I will add, to their honour,
the humanity and generoſity of the higher and
middle claſſes of ſociety, naturally and neceſſarily
altered this ſtate of things. The poor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to the juſtices that their wages would not
enable them to ſupply their families in the ſingle
article of bread. The juſtices very humanely,
and I am far from ſaying improperly, liſtened to
their complaints, inquired what was the ſmalleſt
ſum on which they could ſupport their families,
at the then price of wheat, and gave an order of
relief on the pariſh accordingly. The poor were
now enabled, for a ſhort time, to purchaſe nearly
their uſual quantity of flour; but the ſtock in the
country was not ſufficient, even with the proſpect
of importation, to allow of the uſual diſtribution
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0028202200:11"/>
to all its members. The crop was conſuming
too faſt. Every market-day the demand exceeded
the ſupply; and thoſe whoſe buſineſs it was to
judge on theſe ſubjects, felt convinced, that in a
month or two the ſcarcity would be greater than
it was at that time. Thoſe who were able, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
kept back their corn. In ſo doing, they
undoubtedly conſulted their own intereſt; but
they, as undoubtedly, whether with the intention
or not is of no conſequence, conſulted the true
intereſt of the ſtate: for, if they had not kept it
back, too much would have been conſumed, and
there would have been a famine inſtead of a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
at the end of the year.</p>
            <p>The corn, therefore, naturally roſe. The poor
were again diſtreſſed. Freſh complaints were
made to the juſtices, and a further relief granted;
but, like the water from the mouth of Tantalus, the
corn ſtill ſlipped from the graſp of the poor; and
roſe again ſo as to diſable them from purchaſing
a ſufficiency to keep their families in health. The
alarm now became ſtill greater, and more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <note n="*" place="bottom">I am deſcribing what took place in the neighbourhood where I then lived; and I have reaſon to believe that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nearly ſimilar took place in moſt counties of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note>. The juſtices in their individual capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0028202200:12"/>
were not thought competent to determine
on the proper modes of relief in the preſent criſis,
a general meeting of the magiſtrates was called,
aided by the united wiſdom of other gentlemen
of the county; but the reſult was merely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
and extenſion of the former ſyſtem of
relief; and, to ſay the truth, I hardly ſee what elſe
could have been done. In ſome pariſhes this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
was given in the ſhape of flour; in others,
which was certainly better, in money, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a recommendation not to ſpend the
whole of it in wheaten bread, but to adopt ſome
other kind of food. All, however, went upon the
principle of inquiring what was the uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of flour in the different families, and of
enabling them to purchaſe nearly the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
that they did before the ſcarcity. With this
additional command of money in the lower claſſes,
and the conſequent increaſed conſumption, the
number of purchaſers at the then price would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
exceed the ſupply. The corn would in
conſequence continue riſing. The poor's rates in
many pariſhes increaſed from four ſhillings in the
pound to fourteen; the price of wheat neceſſarily
kept pace with them; and before the end of the
year was at near forty pounds a load; when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0028202200:13"/>
without the operation of this cauſe it would
not have exceeded twenty or twenty-five.</p>
            <p>Some of the poor would naturally make uſe
of their additional command of money to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
butter, cheeſe, bacon, pickled pork, rice,
potatoes, &amp;c. Theſe commodities are all more
limited in quantity than corn; and would, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
more ſuddenly feel the increaſed demand.
If butter, cheeſe, bacon, pickled pork, and the
coarſer parts of meat, had continued at their
uſual price, they would have been purchaſed by
ſo many, to come in aid of an inferior kind of
bread, or to give a reliſh and additional nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their potatoes and rice, that the ſupply
would not have been half adequate to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of theſe articles that was wanted. Theſe
commodities, therefore, roſe as naturally and as
neceſſarily as the corn; and, according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
principles of fair trade, their price was
fixed at that ſum which only ſuch a number could
afford to give, as would enable the ſupply to
anſwer the demand.</p>
            <p>To fix upon this ſum is the great object of

               </gap> every commodity

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> muſt, of courſe,
exerciſe his private judgment. A reflecting
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0028202200:14"/>
mind, far from being aſtoniſhed that there are
now and then errors in ſpeculation, muſt feel
much greater aſtoniſhment that there are ſo few;
and that the ſupplies of a large nation, whether
plentiful or ſcanty, ſhould be diſtributed ſo
equally throughout the year. Moſt happily for
ſociety, individual intereſt is, in theſe caſes, ſo
cloſely and intimately interwoven with the public
intereſt, that one cannot gain or loſe without a
gain or loſs to the other. The man who refuſes
to ſend his corn to market when it is at twenty
pounds a load, becauſe he thinks that in two
months time it will be at thirty, if he be right
in his judgment, and ſucceed in his ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is a poſitive and decided benefactor to the
ſtate; becauſe he keeps his ſupply to that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
when the ſtate is much more in want of
it; and if he and ſome others did not keep it
back in that manner, inſtead of its being thirty
in two months, it would be forty or fifty.</p>
            <p>If he be wrong in his ſpeculation, he loſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
very conſiderably himſelf, and the ſtate
ſuffers a little; becauſe, had he brought his corn
to market at twenty, the price would have fallen
ſooner, and the event ſhowed that there was
corn enough in the country to allow of it; but
the ſlight evil that the ſtate ſuffers in this caſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0028202200:15"/>
is almoſt wholly compenſated by the glut in the
market, when the corn is brought out, which
makes the price fall below what it would have
been otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>I am far from ſaying that there can be no
ſuch thing as monopoly, and the other hard
words that have been ſo much talked of. In a
commodity of a confined nature, within the
purchaſe of two or three large capitals, or of a
company of merchants, we all know that it has
often exiſted; and, in a very few inſtances, the
article may have been in part deſtroyed, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance
the price, as the Dutch Company de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
the nutmeg-trees in their ſpice iſlands:
but in an article which is in ſo many hands as
corn is, in this country, monopoly, to any perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
extent, may ſafely be pronounced impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
Where are the capitals, or where is the
company of merchants, rich enough to buy
ſuch a quantity of corn, as would make it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to them to deſtroy, or, which is the ſame
thing, not to ſell a great part of it? As they
could not, by the greateſt exertions, purchaſe
one fourth of all the corn in the country, it is
evident that, if any conſiderable part of their
ſtock remained unſold, they would have enriched
all the other dealers in corn at their own expenſe;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0028202200:16"/>
and would not have gained half ſo much in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to their capital as the reſt of the farmers
and cornfactors. If on the contrary all their
ſtock ſold, it would be a proof that the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been juſt, and that the country had really
benefited by it.</p>
            <p>It ſeems now to be univerſally agreed, that the
ſtock of old corn remaining on hand at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the harveſt this year was unuſually ſmall,
notwithſtanding that the harveſt came on nearly
a month ſooner than could have been expected
in the beginning of June. This is a clear, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
and unanſwerable proof that there had
been no ſpeculations in corn that were preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to the country. All that the large farmers
and cornfactors had done, was to raiſe the corn to
that price which excluded a ſufficient number
from their uſual conſumption, to enable the
ſupply to laſt throughout the year. This price,
however, has been moſt eſſentially and powerfully
affected by the ability that has been given to the
labouring poor, by means of pariſh allowances,
of continuing to purchaſe wheat notwithſtanding
its extraordinary riſe: and this ability muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
prevent the price of corn from falling very
materially, till there is an actual glut in the
market; for, while the whole ſtock will go off at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0028202200:17"/>
thirty pounds a load, it cannot, on any regular
principle of trade, ſink lower. I was in very
great hopes, juſt before the harveſt, that ſuch a
glut was about to take place; but it is now
to be feared, from the nature of the preſent crop,
that no ſuch happy event can be hoped for during
the year.</p>
            <p>I do not know whether I have convinced my
reader that the cauſe which I have aſſigned of the
preſent extraordinary price of proviſions is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate
to the effect; but I certainly feel moſt
ſtrongly convinced of it myſelf; and I cannot
but believe that, if he differ from me, it can only
be in degree, and from thinking that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of pariſh allowances has not yet been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
far enough to produce any material effect.
With regard to the principle itſelf, if it were
really carried into execution, it appears to me
capable almoſt of mathematical demonſtration,
that, granting a real ſcarcity of one-fourth, which
could not be remedied by importation, it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate
to the effecting any height of price that
the proportion of the circulating medium to the
quantity of corn daily conſumed would admit.</p>
            <p>It has often been propoſed, and more than
once I believe, in the Houſe of Commons, to
proportion the price of labour exactly to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0028202200:18"/>
price of proviſions. This, though it would
be always a bad plan, might paſs tolerably in
years of moderate plenty, or in a country that
was in the habit of a conſiderable exportation of
grain. But let us ſee what would be its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in a real ſcarcity. We ſuppoſe, for the ſake
of the argument, that by law every kind of labour
is to be paid accurately in proportion to the price
of corn, and that the rich are to be aſſeſſed to
the utmoſt to ſupport thoſe in the ſame manner
who are thrown out of employment, and fall
upon the pariſh. We allow the ſcarcity to
be an irremediable deficiency of one fourth of
all the proviſions of the country. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that, notwithſtanding this deficiency, there
would be no reaſon for economy in the labouring
claſſes. The riſe of their wages, or the pariſh
allowances that they would receive, would enable
them to purchaſe exactly the ſame quantity of
corn, or other proviſions, that they did before,
whatever their price might be. The ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
would of courſe be conſumed; and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the regular principles of trade, as the ſtock
continued diminiſhing, the price of all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
of life would continue riſing, in the
moſt rapid and unexampled manner. The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
claſſes of ſociety would very ſoon be blended
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0028202200:19"/>
with the poor; and the largeſt fortunes could
not long ſtand againſt the accumulated preſſure
of the extraordinary price of proviſions, on the
one hand, and the ſtill more extraordinary aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for allowances to thoſe who had no other
means of ſupport, on the other. The corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
and farmers would undoubtedly be the
laſt that ſuffered, but, at the expiration of the
three quarters of a year, what they received with
one hand, they muſt give away with the other;
and a moſt complete levelling of all property
would take place. All would have the ſame
quantity of money. All the proviſions of the
country would be conſumed: and all the people
would ſtarve together.</p>
            <p>There is no kind of fear, that any ſuch tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
event ſhould ever happen in any country;
but allowed myſelf to make the ſuppoſition;
becauſe, it appears to me, that, in the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
machinery of human ſociety, the effect
of any particular principle frequently eſcapes
from the view, even of an attentive obſerver, if
it be not magnified by puſhing it to extremity.</p>
            <p>I do not, however, by any means, intend to
infer, from what I have ſaid, that the pariſh
allowances have been prejudicial to the ſtate;
or that, as far as the ſyſtem has been hitherto
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0028202200:20"/>
purſued, or is likely to be purſued, in this
country, that it is not one of the beſt modes of
relief that the circumſtances of the caſe will
admit. The ſyſtem of the poor laws, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
I certainly do moſt heartily condemn, as
I have expreſſed in another place, but I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to think that their operation in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſcarcity has been advantageous to the
country. The principal benefit which they have
produced, is exactly that which is moſt bitterly
complained of—the high price of all the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
of life. The poor cry out loudly at
this price; but, in ſo doing, they are very little
aware of what they are about; for it has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
been owing to this price that a much
greater number of them has not been ſtarved.</p>
            <p>It was calculated that there were only two-thirds
of an average crop laſt year. Probably,
even with the aid of all that we imported, the
deficiency ſtill remained a fifth or ſixth. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ten millions of people in the iſland;
the whole of this deficiency, had things been
left to their natural courſe, would have fallen
almoſt excluſively on two, or perhaps three
millions of the pooreſt inhabitants, a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
number of whom muſt in conſequence
have ſtarved. The operation of the pariſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0028202200:21"/>
by raiſing the price of proviſions ſo
high, cauſed the diſtreſs to be divided among
five or ſix millions, perhaps, inſtead of two or
three, and to be by no means unfelt even by the
remainder of the population.</p>
            <p>The high price, therefore, which is ſo much
complained of by the poor, has eſſentially mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated
their diſtreſs by bringing down to their
level two or three millions more, and making
them almoſt equal ſharers in the preſſure of the
ſcarcity.</p>
            <p>The further effects of the high price have
been to enforce a ſtrict economy in all ranks of
life; to encourage an extraordinary importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to animate the farmer by the powerful
motive of ſelf-intereſt to make every exertion
to obtain as great a crop as poſſible the next
year.</p>
            <p>If economy, importation, and every poſſible
encouragement to future production, have not
the faireſt chance of putting an end to the ſcarcity,
I confeſs myſelf at a loſs to ſay what better means
can be ſubſtituted. I may undoubtedly on this
ſubject be much miſtaken; but to me, I own,
they appear more calculated to anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
intended, than the hanging any number of
farmers and cornfactors that could be named.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0028202200:22"/>
No inference, therefore, is meant to be drawn
againſt what has been done for the relief of the
poor in the preſent ſcarcity, though it has with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt greatly raiſed the price of proviſions.
All that I contend for is, that we ſhould be
aware of the effect of what we ourſelves have
done, and not lay the blame on the wrong
perſons.</p>
            <p>If the cauſe, which I have detailed, be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to account for the preſent high price of
proviſions, without the ſuppoſition of any unfair
dealing among the farmers and cornfactors, we
ought ſurely to bear the preſent preſſure like
men labouring under a diſorder that muſt have
its courſe, and not throw obſtacles in the way of
returning plenty, and endanger the future ſupplies
of our markets, by encouraging the popular cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and keeping the farmers and corn-dealers
in perpetual fear for their lives and property.</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe that a year of ſcarcity can paſs
without diſtreſſing ſeverely a large part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of a country, is to ſuppoſe a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in the nature of things. I know of no
other definition of a ſcarcity than the failure of
the uſual quantity of proviſions; and if a great
part of the people had but juſt enough before,
they muſt undoubtedly have leſs than enough at
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0028202200:23"/>
ſuch a period. With regard to the ſcarcity being
artificial, it appears to me ſo impoſſible, that,
till it has been proved that ſome man or ſet of
men, with a capital of twenty or thirty millions
ſterling, has bought up half the corn in the
country, I own I muſt ſtill diſbelieve it. On
this ſubject, however, I know that I differ from
ſome very reſpectable friends of mine, among
the common people, who ſay that it is quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that there can be a real ſcarcity, becauſe
you may get what quantity of corn you pleaſe,
if you have but money enough; and to ſay the
truth, many perſons, who ought to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
argue exactly in the ſame way. I have
often talked with labouring men on this ſubject,
and endeavoured to ſhow them, that if they,
or I, had a great deal of money, and other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had but little, we could undoubtedly buy
what quantity of corn we liked, by taking away
the ſhares of thoſe who were leſs rich; but that
if all the people had the ſame ſum, and that there
was not enough corn in the country to ſupply all,
we could not get what we wanted for money,
though we poſſeſſed millions. I never found,
however, that my rhetoric produced much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>The cry at preſent is in favour of ſmall farms,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0028202200:24"/>
and againſt middle men. No two clamours can
well be more inconſiſtent with each other, as the
deſtruction of the middle men would, I conceive,
neceſſarily involve with it the deſtruction of ſmall
farmers. The ſmall farmer requires a quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of his ſcanty capital to enable him to pay
his rent and his workmen; and muſt therefore
ſend his corn to market almoſt immediately after
harveſt. If he were required to perform the
office of corn-dealer, as well as farmer, and wait
to regulate his ſupplies to the demands of the
markets, a double capital would be abſolutely
neceſſary to him, and not having that, he would
be ruined.</p>
            <p>Many men of ſenſe and information have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
the dearneſs of proviſions to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of paper in circulation. There was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
great reaſon for apprehenſion, that
when, by the ſtoppage of the Bank to pay in
ſpecie, the emiſſion of paper ceaſed to have its
natural check, the circulation would be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded
with this currency; but this certainly
could not have taken place to any conſiderable
extent without a ſenſible depreciation of bank
notes in compariſon with ſpecie. As this depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
did not happen, the progreſs of the evil
muſt have been ſlow and gradual, and never
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0028202200:25"/>
could have produced the ſudden and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
riſe in the price of proviſions which was
ſo ſenſibly felt laſt year, after a ſeaſon of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
cheapneſs, ſubſequent to the ſtoppage of the
Bank.</p>
            <p>There is one circumſtance, however, that
ought to be attended to. To circulate the ſame,
or nearly the ſame<note n="*" place="bottom">In a ſcarcity the quantity of commodities in circulation is probably not ſo great as in years of plenty.</note>, quantity of commodities
through a country, when they bear a much
higher price, muſt require a greater quantity of
the medium, whatever that may be. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
naturally takes up more. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
therefore, that the Bank has found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to iſſue a greater number of its notes on
this account. Or, if it has not, this deficiency
has been ſupplied by the country bankers, who
have found that their notes now ſtay out longer,
and in greater quantity, than they did before the
ſcarcity, which may tempt many to overtrade
their capitals. If the quantity of paper, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in circulation has greatly increaſed during
the laſt year, I ſhould be inclined to conſider it
rather as the effect than the cauſe of the high
price of proviſions. This ſulneſs of circulating
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0028202200:26"/>
medium, however, will be one of the obſtacles
in the way to returning cheapneſs.</p>
            <p>The public attention is now fixed with anxiety
towards the meeting of Parliament, which is to
relieve us from our preſent difficulties; but the
more conſiderate do not feel very ſanguine on
this ſubject, knowing how little is to be done
in this ſpecies of diſtreſs by legiſlative inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
We interfere to fix the aſſize of bread.
Perhaps one of the beſt interferences of the
Legiſlature, in the preſent inſtance, would be
to aboliſh that aſſize. I have certainly no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to believe in combinations and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies;
but the great interval that elapſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the fall of wheat and the fall of flour,
compared with the quick ſucceſſion of the riſe
of flour to the riſe of wheat, would almoſt tempt
one to ſuppoſe, that there might be ſome little
management in the return of the meal weighers
to the Lord Mayor. If the public ſuffer in this
inſtance, it is evidently owing to the aſſize,
without which, the opportunity of any ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
would not exiſt. And what occaſion
can there be for an aſſize in a city like London,
in which there are ſo many bakers? If ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
were ever neceſſary, it would appear to
be moſt ſo in a country village or ſmall town,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0028202200:27"/>
where perhaps there is but one perſon in the
trade, and who might, therefore, for a time, have
an opportunity of impoſing on his cuſtomers;
but this could not take place where there was
ſuch room for competition as in London. If
there were no aſſize, more attention would be
conſtantly paid to the weight and quality of the
bread bought; and the bakers who ſold the beſt
in theſe two reſpects would have the moſt cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.
The removal of this regulation would
remove, in a great meaſure, the difficulty about
brown bread, and a much greater quantity of it
would probably be conſumed.</p>
            <p>The ſoup-ſhops, and every attempt to make
a nouriſhing and palatable food of what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not in uſe among the common people, muſt
evidently be of great ſervice in the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs.</p>
            <p>It is a fact now generally acknowledged, and
it has lately received an official ſanction in a
letter of the Duke of portland to the Lord
Lieutenant of the county of Oxford, that of late
years, even in the beſt ſeaſons, we have not
grown corn ſufficient for our own conſumption;
whereas, twenty years ago, we were in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
habit of exporting grain to a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
amount. Though we may ſuppoſe that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0028202200:28"/>
the agriculture of the country has not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing,
as it ought to have done, during this
period; yet we cannot well imagine that it has
gone backwards. To what then can we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the preſent inability in the country to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
its inhabitants, but to the increaſe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation?
I own that I cannot but conſider
the late ſevere preſſures of diſtreſs on every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
in our crops, as a very ſtrong exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification
of a principle which I endeavoured to
explain in an eſſay publiſhed about two years
ago, entitled, <hi>An Eſſay on the Principle of
Population, as it affects the future Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Society.</hi> It was conſidered by many
who read it, merely as a ſpecious argument, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applicable
to the preſent ſtate of ſociety; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it contradicted ſome preconceived opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
on theſe ſubjects. Two years reflection
have, however, ſerved ſtrongly to convince
me of the truth of the principle there advanced,
and of its being the real cauſe of the continued
depreſſion and poverty of the lower claſſes of
ſociety, of the total inadequacy of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
eſtabliſhments in their favour to relieve
them, and of the periodical returns of ſuch
ſeaſons of diſtreſs as we have of late experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0028202200:29"/>
The eſſay has now been out of print above a
year; but I have deferred giving another edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it in the hope of being able to make it
more worthy of the public attention, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the principle directly and excluſively to the
exiſting ſtate of ſociety, and endeavouring to
illuſtrate the power and univerſality of its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the beſt authenticated accounts that we
have of the ſtate of other countries. Particular
engagements in the former part of the time, and
ſome moſt unforeſeen and unfortunate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
latterly, have hitherto prevented me
from turning my attention, with any effect,
towards this ſubject. I ſtill, however, have it
in view. In the mean time I hope that this
haſty attempt to add my mite to the public ſtock
of information, in the preſent emergency, will be
received with candour.</p>
