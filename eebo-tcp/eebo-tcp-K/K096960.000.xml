            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now ſome years ſince this nation entered into war againſt a powerful neighbour, in defence of rights and poſſeſſions ſecured to us by ſacred and recent treaties, but treacherouſly invaded and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us. At the ſame time, a powerful combination of the mightieſt ſtates in <hi>Europe,</hi> has been formed againſt an heroic prince, who is the glory of this age, and will be the wonder of poſterity; in whoſe preſervation, we are deeply intereſted, not only becauſe he is the ally of our gracious ſovereign, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0749400300:3"/>
chiefly becauſe he is a main patron of that pure, reformed religion, which it is our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to have eſtabliſhed in our land; and which, zeal for truth, and concern for the preſent and eternal good of mankind ought to make us wiſh to continue and to ſpread. Both we and our allies have had ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the uncertainties of war, but far greater experience of the goodneſs of that God, who hath bleſſed our arms with ſucceſs, ſignal, and almoſt unparalleled. This has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced the heart of our good king; but he has not aſcribed it to the wiſdom of his own councils, or to the power of his numerous fleets and armies. Glorying in his allegiance to the <hi>king of kings,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. vi. 15.</note> exulting in the light of his countenance, piouſly acknowledging, that all his victories are the undeſerved gift of the <hi>only potentate</hi> of heaven and earth, and that his power alone can give him continued ſucceſs; he has called upon all his ſubjects in every
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0749400300:4"/>
part of his <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions, to give thanks this day, with one heart, to him who is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the higheſt, for that national proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which he has beſtowed upon us. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to accompany the expreſſions of our fervent gratitude, with ſincere and earneſt prayers, that God would continue to give us ſucceſs in war, while war muſt laſt; and that he would ſoon eſtabliſh peace on an equal, honourable, and permanent foundation. In this ſituation, I do not know any terms in which I can addreſs you more ſuitably, either to the pious intention of our ſovereign, or to the duty that is incumbent upon ourſelves, than thoſe of the text: <hi>Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be aſhamed and confounded for your own ways, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the preceeding part of the chapter, the prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had foretold, that the heathen nations, who had formerly oppreſſed the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; when they were ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0749400300:5"/>
them, ſhould oppreſs them no more, but ſhould be themſelves deſtroyed; that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould live in peace, and enjoy plenty in their own land; and that they ſhould likewiſe enjoy the richeſt ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bleſſings. He frequently, however, in the courſe of this prediction, reminds them of their own obſtinate wickedneſs; aſſures them, that all this goodneſs was entirely undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was the very oppoſite of what their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct merited; and informs them, that it ought therefore to excite them to a deep repentance, and a thorough reformation. That theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations might make the deeper impreſſion on them, he exhibits them in one view, in the words which we have read: from which I will take occaſion to excite you to the duties which our preſent circumſtances demand, by purſuing the following method.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I WILL turn your attention to <hi>this,</hi> which the Lord hath <hi>done</hi> for us; to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0749400300:6"/>
ſucceſſes, which ought this day to fill our hearts with gratitude to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I WILL point out, how much theſe bleſſings are enhanced, and how much our gratitude ought to be inflamed by this circumſtance, that we were ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them, as, on the contrary, to merit the ſevereſt judgments. <hi>Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord God, be it known unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I WILL ſhew, how ſtrongly theſe public bleſſings, beſtowed upon us in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation, ſhould urge us to reformation. <hi>Be aſhamed and confounded for your own ways, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I WILL turn your attention to thoſe national ſucceſſes, which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us, and which ought this day to fill our hearts with gratitude to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0749400300:7"/>GOD has, in all ages, given ſome nations much greater advantages than others. Each nation is apt to be partial to itſelf; but, after making all reaſonable allowances for this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, we may juſtly ſay, that few nations have been ſo highly favoured of heaven, in a free conſtitution of government, in mild and equitable laws, and in purity of religion, as that in which we live. God has been, for ages paſt, beſtowing upon us, one national bleſſing after another, often by means which ſeemed to have a contrary tendency, 'till he has, at laſt, accumulated on us all that can render a people great and happy. It would require the whole day to enumerate, in the briefeſt manner, the publick bleſſings which we now enjoy, or reap the happy conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of. Your patience would be fatigued with hearing a rehearſal only of the bleſſings of the preſent auſpicious reign. I will therefore confine myſelf to thoſe, which are the peculiar ſubjects of this day's public thankſgiving.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0749400300:8"/>
Were I to deſcend to a particular detail even of them, I ſhould convert a ſermon into an hiſtory of one of the moſt ſplendid periods of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> glory.</p>
            <p>OUR ſucceſſes in the preſent war are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited within the compaſs of a very few years; but they are ſo many and ſo great, that they would have rendered a whole long reign illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious. In every quarter of the world, the arms of <hi>Britain</hi> and its allies have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; and wherever they have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, they have been crowned with vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Our fleets have overcome, and our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have triumphed. Scarce had we time to rejoice in one ſucceſs, 'till it was almoſt driven out of our memory by a greater. We formed large expectations from the ſpirit of our king, from the wiſdom and integrity of his miniſters, and from the ſkill and bravery of our commanders: but ſay, let any <hi>Briton</hi> ſay, did ever your moſt ſanguine hopes riſe ſo high as our real ſucceſs? We have exhauſted the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0749400300:9"/>
treaſures of our enemies, and broken their power; but our riches are not diminiſhed, our force is not weakened. We have defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their deſigns to annoy us, and we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed them in their very gates. We began the war to defend our own poſſeſſions; we have not only defended them, but we have won from our enemies ſtrong fortreſſes, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile iſlands, rich ſettlements, and vaſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents. Our acquiſitions are not merely fit to gratify wild ambition, but are uſeful for the enlargement of our commerce, for the increaſe of our riches, for the ſecurity of the lives of our fellow-ſubjects in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies, and for extending the pure, reformed religion over large tracts of country. They are won from a nation, which is our rival in power and trade, and the enemy of our religion and liberty; which has often attempted to ſet a popiſh pretender, the deſcendant of a tyrant, who derives his claim from the principles of ſlavery, upon the throne of theſe kingdoms; and which is at preſent engaged in a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0749400300:10"/>
to extirpate the proteſtant religion from <hi>Germany,</hi> and to oppreſs that hero, whom God hath raiſed for its defence.</p>
            <p>BUT if the number, the quick ſucceſſion, and the important nature of our ſucceſſes do not enough excite your joy and your gratitude, attend to the circumſtances, which render them more aſtoniſhing.</p>
            <p>WHEN this war began, <hi>Britain</hi> had but one ally; and he was by his ſituation incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of aiding her with a naval force, and by his circumſtances at that time, unable to give aſſiſtance in any way. <hi>Britain</hi> was deſerted by her ancient friends, for whom ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpared her blood or treaſure, who owed their very being to her unſhaken faithfulneſs. They were even ſo ungrateful as to join with <hi>France,</hi> and laboured to oppreſs our only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Our enemies had, in the midſt of peace, advanced far in making preparations for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging war with advantage. <hi>Britain,</hi> faithful to treaty, and void of ſuſpicion that thoſe poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0749400300:11"/>
would be attacked, which were ſecured by its ſacred ties, had taken no ſteps for its own defence. It had its armies to ſend to its diſtant colonies, when they had need to be already in the field. And for ſome time we ſeemed to ſuffer by that want of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which unſuſpicious honeſty had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
            <p>ARMIES were ſent to our colonies; and they were cut to pieces. Fleets were ſent on one ſervice; but the ſeaſon for it was expired: they were ſent on another; but cowardice or infatuation ſeized them. We were threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an invaſion at home; we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the threats, and left part of our fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign dominions an eaſy prey to our rapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemies. Our brave ally was hemmed in, on every hand, by many armies, each of which ſeemed more than ſufficient to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him up. Endeavouring to extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from preſſing difficulties, he ſeveral times
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0749400300:12"/>
loſt part of his little army, whom he could ill ſpare; and ſuffered defeats, which made all, but his own great ſoul, give him up for loſt. An illuſtrious prince, who in his youth had chaced rebellion from our land, was not able, with the wiſdom of maturer age, to protect the electoral dominions of his royal father from the cruel ravages of our enemies, or to hinder them from ſeizing them as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. God ſeemed to fight againſt us. The whole nation was ſunk into feebleneſs and deſpondence. Wiſe counſels were neceſſary; but faction obſtructed them. Vigour was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite; but indolence and effeminacy had ſeized every heart.</p>
            <p>To theſe deſperate circumſtances we were once reduced; but from them our glory ſprung. Danger baniſhed faction; wiſe counſels were concerted, and vigorous meaſures were reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on. Abilities appeared both in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0749400300:13"/>
and in the camp, which ſeemed to deſerve an opportunity of ſaving a nation from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, in order to diſplay them. Former miſtakes gave riſe to the beſt propoſals. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer misbehaviours were ſucceeded by won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of conduct and of courage. Our generals and our allies were reduced to difficulties, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they might ſurmount them with the greater glory. A deſperate ſituation ſeemed only deſigned to render a victory more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and complete. Our very loſſes removed circumſtances, which would have obſtructed our gaining greater advantages. <hi>Five have chaced an hundred, and an hundred have put ten thouſand to flight.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Lev. xxvi. 8.</note> And let us not forget that, while our country has been carrying on war with ſucceſs ſo unparalleled, we have never once felt the dangers or loſſes of war. While others have been expoſed to its fury, our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and our fortunes have been ſecure. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0749400300:14"/>
have hazarded their lives; but we have enjoyed the ſweets of peace, in the midſt of war. And to the profoundeſt quiet, the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt plenty has been ſuperadded. Our cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns have abounded in conqueſt; and our ſeaſons have excelled in fertility.</p>
            <p>CAN you conſider all this, my friends, and not rejoice? I will not check your joy. But let it not be light or diſſipated; let it not reſt in the mere view of the advantages, which our country has gained. I will not attempt to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen your regard or your veneration for thoſe, to whom we owe theſe illuſtrious tranſactions. The brave hero, the dear friend, the belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kinſman, who have ſhed their blood in their country's cauſe, demand a tear from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Briton.</hi> The bold ſailor, the daring ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, the intrepid commander, the wiſe ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the gracious ſovereign, who have been the inſtruments of our glory, deſerve our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0749400300:15"/>
and our prayers. But who is the firſt cauſe of all? <hi>I do this,</hi> ſaith the Lord, our God. Could ſo many ſucceſſes have fallen to our ſhare, if the <hi>Lord of hoſts</hi> had not fought with us? Who is ſo blind, as not to perceive his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the ſurpriſing turns of ſucceſs? Who is it that could have diſconcerted our beſt laid ſchemes by a croſs accident, and has not? <hi>Who ruleth the raging of the ſea,</hi>
               <note n="c" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxxix. 9.</note> and has hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it from ſwallowing up our navies? Who has ſteeled the ſailor's and the ſoldier's heart againſt the attacks of fear? Who has beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us generals poſſeſſed of greater milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſkill in early youth, than moſt can acquire in a whole life-time? Who has given us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, who exert the valour and activity of health and youth, amidſt the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of excruciating pain, or the diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening infirmities of old age? Who has raiſed up, in theſe degenerate days, a miniſter, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the diſintereſted and incorruptible and ſteady principles of an old republican? Who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0749400300:16"/>
has caſt into this age, and engaged on our ſide a prince greater than any whom hiſtory has recorded?

            <p n="2">II. To excite us ſtill more to this; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance our mercies, and to inflame our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, let us conſider, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, as was propoſed, that we were ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſo ſignal bleſſings, as, on the contrary, to merit the ſevereſt judgments. <hi>Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord God, be it known unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0749400300:17"/>THAT God, whoſe juſtice will never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to puniſh either an individual or a nation, except they deſerve it, is ſo abundant in goodneſs, that he very often beſtows bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, both on individuals and on nations, when they are moſt undeſerving. Did he not, could <hi>Britain</hi> be, at this day, ſo proſperous and happy? Our ſucceſſes and our bleſſings are almoſt unequalled: but is our virtue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalled too?</p>
            <p>I INTEND not to load our national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with every kind of vice. I hope truth will not permit it. This is a day of gladneſs, and forbids me to bring forth all our real abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations into light. I will not affect to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that we have many national virtues. I will mention, to the honour of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the high ſenſe of liberty, and manly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of ſentiment, which we poſſeſs; our faithfulneſs in our alliances; our ſcrupulous adherence to treaties. I will own, that, far from ſtirring up unjuſt war, we are even back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0749400300:18"/>
to engage in that which is neceſſary: that, when the monſter war muſt be let looſe, we are at pains to reſtrain it from exerting its utmoſt fury; that we hate barbarity in the field and exerciſe humanity to priſoners. I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege that the cauſe for which we fight is juſt and glorious, the defence of our own rights, the protection of the faith of treaties, the curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of boundleſs ambition, and the ſupport of a firm patron of the proteſtant religion.</p>
            <p>BUT can we in all this find merit adequate to ſuch proſperity? Or is there nothing to counterballance our virtues? A juſt cauſe is a ground for our hopes and prayers, but gives us no right to ſucceſs. The higheſt national virtue is only what we owe in ſtricteſt duty to the almighty king of nations; is but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect return of gratitude for the public mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies tranſmitted to us by our anceſtors. But muſt not the moſt favourable judgment deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that we are far from anſwering the calls of duty and of gratitude? We enjoy the beſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0749400300:19"/>
conſtitution of government under heaven; do we prize it ſufficiently? are we enough thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God for it? do we ſtudy to promote general union and harmony? do we never turn our liberty into licentiouſneſs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and faction? do the governed ſhow continually that public ſpirit, which would unite them in purſuing the public intereſt, without obliging the rulers to uſe corruption? or is there no inſtance in which this engine is employed to induce men to what is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the common good? We enjoy chriſtianity in its pureſt form. We are free from <hi>the commandments of men,</hi>
               <note n="f" place="bottom">Matth. xv. 9.</note> from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of bigots, and from the vain traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of artful or weak mortals. But do none among us therefore affect a freedom alſo from <hi>the commandments of God,</hi>
               <note n="g" place="bottom">Mat. xv. 6.</note> and from <hi>the faith which was once delivered unto the ſaints?</hi>
               <note n="h" place="bottom">Jude 3.</note> Has the purity of the goſpel protected our land from infidelity? We are delivered from that burden of uſeleſs ceremonies, which once di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0749400300:20"/>
the care of men from the real duties of religion; but has removal of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centered and invigorated our endeavours to practiſe genuine piety and virtue? Is our practice of religion purer and more blameleſs than that of our neighbours, who retain popiſh ſuperſtition? Do we ſhow a deeper ſenſe of God and a greater reverence of his name? Are we more conſtant in our attendance on his worſhip, or more fervent in our manner of performing it? I fear the reverſe is true, to our confuſion. Our commerce is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; but is it always carried on with fairneſs and equity? We enjoy plenty; but do none abuſe it as food to luxury and debauchery, as materials of extravagance, as means of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſſipation? Have our ſoldiers and our ſailors, on whoſe valour our defence immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately depends, that religious truſt in God, which alone can render valour rational? Our public bleſſings have been long continued with us; but have we even yet learned to improve
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0749400300:21"/>
them? We have ſometimes been threatened with the loſs of them; but has the fear of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them awakened us to uſe them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly?</p>
            <p>Do not theſe ſins naturally demand judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the puniſhment of them, the reverſe of thoſe bleſſings, from the abuſe of which they have ſprung? But God heaps new bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon us, and gives us new ſecurity for thoſe which we have long enjoyed. Can we recollect that his goodneſs is ſo undeſerved, and yet feel no gratitude in our hearts? Can the higheſt gratitude equal the occaſion? Does not the remembrance of our unworthineſs properly belong to the duty of this day, when it tends ſo ſtrongly to inflame our gratitude? It likewiſe tends to give it a right direction, to keep it from ſpending itſelf in a tranſient rapture, to render it ſo ſedate and fixed, that it may remain in the heart, and produce laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruits.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0749400300:22"/>III. THIS brings us to the <hi>laſt</hi> thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to ſhew how ſtrongly theſe public bleſſings, beſtowed upon us in our preſent ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, urge us to reformation.</p>
            <p>WE deſerve judgments; God ſhowers down his richeſt bleſſings on us; they cannot be rewards of our righteouſneſs; for what purpoſe then are they beſtowed, but to be motives to repentance and obedience?</p>
            <p>COMPARE God's continued bleſſings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us, with the continued provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we have given him in return; and ſay, can we have the ſmalleſt ſpark of ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, if we be not <hi>aſhamed and confounded for our own ways?</hi> Do theſe ſins, which abound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, become that nation, whom God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have choſen for his peculiar favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite? We had indulged heinous ſins; yet God bleſſed us. Should not ingenuity have moved us, whenever he began to bleſs us, to bluſh
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0749400300:23"/>
for our former misbehaviours towards him, and to turn immediately to the moſt dutiful and exemplary obedience of his laws? He has gone on to bleſs us hitherto, and we have hitherto gone on to ſin againſt him. Will we not at length be ſtruck with ſhame, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our ſins? An ingenuous mind is moſt effectually touched with returns of good for evil; there is no generoſity in that ſoul, which is inacceſſible to their impreſſions. God ſeems to ſuppoſe by his dealings with us, that the ſons of <hi>Britain</hi> are liberal minds. Will we ſhow that we are unworthy of the character, by continuing obſtinate in our ſins, in ſpite of all the good that he can do us? This were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to prove ourſelves daſtardly ſpirits, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of every thing but the rod, incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reclaimed, except by the ſevereſt judgments.</p>
            <p>BUT if we have not ingenuity enough to be ſoothed into our duty, let us conſider that God's undeſerved favours, if they be miſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, will aggravate our guilt, and may
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0749400300:24"/>
provoke him yet to change the face of things. Hitherto we and our confederates have been ſucceſsful; but the war is not ended. Our Illuſtrious ally is yet ſurrounded by all the ſame mighty powers, whom, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the war, we reckoned able to ruin him by a ſingle battle. It is only the memory of the miracles of providence, which God has wrought for him, that hinders us from being ſtill of the ſame opinion. His foes are not exhauſted, but he is weakened. His precious life is continually expoſed to greater danger than the meaneſt ſoldier. Good God ſhield him from every weapon! for ſhould he fall, the conſequences are too dreadful for us to bear to dwell upon them! That nation againſt whom we are engaged in war, has large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, and its king has abſolute power to render them effectual. Our enemies may be rendered deſperate; and what invincible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts will not deſpair ſometimes produce? They already threaten to carry the ſeat of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0749400300:25"/>
war into our own country. We have been alarmed with the fears of it; but we have hitherto dwelt in ſafety. As long as the war continues we are in danger. Should they be allowed to execute their threatenings, then we ſhould know indeed, what a judgment it is to be engaged in war. But tho' we ſhould eſcape the diſaſters which ariſe from the viciſſitudes of war, are there not a thouſand ways, in which God may blaſt in an inſtant all the mercies, which he has heaped upon us? And may not ingratitude for bleſſings ſo ſignal, and impenitence towards ſo bountiful a God, juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoke him to viſit us with a ſad reverſe?</p>
            <p>BUT tho' he ſhould continue our national proſperity, tho' he ſhould, <hi>not for our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but for the wickedneſs</hi>
               <note n="i" place="bottom">Deut. ix. 5.</note> of our enemies, or to accompliſh ſome great good purpoſe of his own, drive them ſtill before us; yet be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that every individual among us, who is not rouſed by our public advantages to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0749400300:26"/>
ſhame for his own perſonal ſins, and to ſincere reformation from them, will be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed hereafter for his ingratitude. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſins of the ſeveral individuals compoſe the national wickedneſs. It is only the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of each particular perſon, that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the nation. It is incumbent on each of us to take care of his own part. Every one ſhares in our publick bleſſings; to every one they ſhould be arguments for repentance and obedience; and they will aggravate the future puniſhment of every particular perſon, by whom they are not thus improved.</p>
            <p>IN a word, the bleſſings which God has beſtowed on our country are great and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: They demand our heartieſt thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him: They demand it the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are undeſerved: They call upon us to be ill-deſerving no longer: They will ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate our future ill-deſert: God will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, if not in this life, yet certainly in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I will conclude with God's addreſs to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0749400300:27"/>
the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which is equally applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, and which contains the ſum of what I have been ſaying: <hi>What nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things, that we call upon him for? And what nation is like this people, for whom God doth great things and terrible? Only take heed to thyſelf and keep thy ſoul diligently, leſt thou forget the things which thine eyes have ſeen, and leſt they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life.</hi>
