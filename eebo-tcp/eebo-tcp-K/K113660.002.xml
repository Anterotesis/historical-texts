            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The hiſtory of a philoſophic vagabond, purſuing novelty, but loſing content.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AFTER we had ſupped, Mrs. Arnold politely offered to ſend a couple of her footmen for my ſon's baggage, which he at firſt ſeemed to decline; but upon her preſſing the requeſt, he was obliged to inform her, that a ſtick and a wallet were all the moveable things upon this earth that he could boaſt of. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Why, aye my ſon,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"you left me but poor, and poor I find you are come back; and yet I make no doubt you have ſeen a great deal of the world."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Yes, Sir,"</q> replied my ſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"but travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling after fortune, is not the way to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0657000202:4"/>
her; and, indeed, of late, I have deſiſted from the purſuit."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, Sir,"</q> cried Mrs. Arnold, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your adventures would be amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: the firſt part of them I have often heard from my niece; but could the company prevail for the reſt, it would be an additional obligation."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Madam,"</q> replied my ſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I can promiſe you the pleaſure you have in hearing, will not be half ſo great as my vanity in the recital; and yet in the whole narrative I can ſcarce promiſe you one adventure, as my account is not of what I did, but what I ſaw. The firſt misfortune of my life, which you all know, was great; but tho' it diſtreſt, it could not ſink me. No perſon ever had a better knack at hoping than I. The leſs kind I found fortune then, the more I expected from her another time, and being now at the bottom of her wheel, every new revolution might lift, but could not depreſs me. I proceeded, therefore, towards London in a fine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0657000202:5"/>
morning, no way uneaſy about to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but chearful as the birds that caroll'd by the road. I comforted myſelf with various reflections, that London was the true mart where abilities of every kind were ſure of meeting diſtinction and reward.<p>"Upon my arrival in town, Sir, my firſt care was to deliver your letter of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to our couſin, who was himſelf in little better circumſtances than me. My firſt ſcheme, you know, Sir, was to be uſher at an academy, and I aſked his advice on the affair. Our couſin received the propoſal with a true Sardonic grin. Aye, cried he, this is a pretty career, indeed, that has been chalked out for you. I have been once an uſher at a boarding ſchool myſelf; and may I die by an anodyne necklace, but I had rather be an under turnkey in Newgate. I was up early and late: I was brow-beat by the maſter, hated for my ugly face by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0657000202:6"/>
worried by the boys within, and never permitted to ſtir out to meet civility abroad. But are you ſure you are fit for a ſchool? Let me examine you a little. Have you been bred apprentice to the buſineſs? No. Then you won't do for a ſchool. Can you dreſs the boys hair? No. Then you won't do for a ſchool. Have you had the ſmall-pox? No. Then you won't do for a ſchool. Can you lie three in a bed? No. Then you will never do for a ſchool. Have you got a good ſtomach? Yes. Then you will by no means do for a ſchool. No, Sir, if you are for a genteel eaſy profeſſion, bind yourſelf ſeven years as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to turn a cutler's wheel; but avoid a ſchool by any means. But come, continued he, I ſee you are a lad of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and ſome learning, what do you think of commencing author, like me? You have read in books, no doubt, of men of genius ſtarving at the trade: but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I'll ſhew you forty very dull fellows
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0657000202:7"/>
about town that live by it in opulence. All honeſt jogg trotmen, who go on ſmoothly and dully, and write hiſtory and politics, and are praiſed; and who, had they been bred coblers, would all their lives have only mended ſhoes, but never made them.</p>
                  <p>"Finding that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the character of an uſher, I reſolved to accept his propoſal; and having the higheſt reſpect for litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I hailed the antiqua mater of Grub-ſtreet with reverence. I thought it my glory to purſue a track which Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Otway trod before me. In fact, I conſidered the goddeſs of this region as the parent of excellence; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an intercourſe with the world might give us good ſenſe, the poverty ſhe grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was the nurſe of genius! Big with theſe reflections, I ſate down, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the beſt things remained to be ſaid on the wrong ſide, I reſolved to write
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0657000202:8"/>
a book that ſhould be wholly new. I therefore dreſt up three paradoxes with ſome ingenuity. They were falſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but they were new. The jewels of truth have been ſo often imported by others, that nothing was left for me to import but ſome ſplendid things that at a diſtance looked every bit as well. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you powers what fancied importance ſate perched upon my quill while I was writing. The whole learned world, I made no doubt, would riſe to oppoſe my ſyſtems; but then I was prepared to oppoſe the whole learned world. Like the porcupine I ſate ſelf collected, with a quill pointed againſt every oppoſer."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Well ſaid, my boy,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"and what ſubject did you treat upon? I hope you did not paſs over the importance of Hierardical monogamy. But I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, go on; you publiſhed your para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes; well, and what did the learned world ſay to your paradoxes?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0657000202:9"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> replied my ſon," <q rend="inline margQuotes">the learned world ſaid nothing to my paradoxes; nothing at all, Sir. Every man of them was employed in praiſing his friends and himſelf, or condemning his enemies; and unfortunately, as I had neither, I ſuffered the cruelleſt mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation," neglect. <p>"As I was meditating one day in a coffee-houſe on the fate of my paradoxes, a little man happening to enter the room, placed himſelf in the box before me, and after ſome preliminary diſcourſe, finding me to be a ſcholar, drew out a bundle of propoſals, begging me to ſubſcribe to a new edition he was going to give the world of Propertius, with notes. This demand neceſſarily produced a reply that that I had no money; and that conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion led him on to enquire into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of my expectations. Finding that my expectations were juſt as great as my purſe, I ſee, cried he, you are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0657000202:10"/>
with the town, I'll teach you a part of it. Look at theſe propoſals, upon theſe very propoſals I have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted very comfortably for twelve years. The moment a nobleman returns from his travels, a Creolian arrives from Jamaica, or a dowager from her country ſeat, I ſtrike for a ſubſcription. I firſt beſiege their hearts with flattery, and then pour in my propoſals at the breach. If they ſubſcribe readily the firſt time, I renew my requeſt to beg a dedication fee. If they let me have that, I ſmite them once more for engraving their coat of arms at the top. Thus, continued he, I live by vanity, and laugh at it. But between ourſelves, I am now too well known, I ſhould be glad to borrow your face a a bit: a nobleman of diſtinction has juſt returned from Italy; my face is familiar to his porter; but if you bring this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of verſes, my life for it you ſucceed, and we divide the ſpoil."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0657000202:11"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Bleſs us, George,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"and is that the employment of poets now! Do men of their exalted talents thus ſtoop to beggary! Can they ſo far diſgrace their calling, as to make a vile traffic of praiſe for bread?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"O no, Sir,"</q> returned he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"a true po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et can never be ſo baſe; for wherever there is genius there is pride. The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures I now deſcribe are only beggars in rhyme. The real poet, as he braves every hardſhip for fame, ſo he is equally a coward to contempt, and none but thoſe who are unworthy protection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to ſolicit it.<p>"Having a mind too proud to ſtoop to ſuch indignities, and yet a fortune too humble to hazard a ſecond attempt for fame, I was now obliged to take a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle courſe, and write for bread. But I was unqualified for a profeſſion where mere induſtry alone could enſure ſucceſs.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0657000202:12"/>
I could not ſuppreſs my lurking paſſion for applauſe; but uſually conſumed that time in efforts after excellence which takes up but little room, when it ſhould have been more advantageouſly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the diffuſive productions of fruitful mediocrity. My little piece would come forth in the miſt of periodical pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, unnoticed and unknown. The public were more importantly employed, than to obſerve the eaſy ſimplicity of my ſtyle, or the harmony of my periods. Sheet after ſheet was thrown off to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion. My eſſays were buried among the eſſays upon liberty, eaſtern tales, and cures for the bite of a mad dog; while Philantos, Philalethes, Philelutheros, and Philanthropos, all wrote better, becauſe they wrote faſter, than I.</p>
                  <p>"Now, therefore, I began to aſſociate with none but diſappointed authors, like myſelf, who praiſed, deplored, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed each other. The ſatisfaction we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0657000202:13"/>
found in every celebrated writer's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, was inverſely as their merits. I found that no genius in another could pleaſe me. My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that ſource of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. I could neither read nor write with ſatisfaction; for excellence in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other was my averſion, and writing was my trade.</p>
                  <p>"In the midſt of theſe gloomy reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as I was one day ſitting on a bench in St. James's park, a young gentleman of diſtinction, who had been my inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance at the univerſity, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me. We ſaluted each other with ſome heſitation, he almoſt aſhamed of being known to one who made ſo ſhabby an appearance, and I afraid of a repulſe. But my ſuſpicions ſoon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; for Ned Thornhill was at the bottom a very good-natured fellow."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0657000202:14"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What did you ſay, George?"</q> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted I. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Thornhill, was not that his name? It can certainly be no other than my landlord."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Bleſs me,"</q> cried Mrs. Arnold, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"is Mr. Thornhill ſo near a neighbour of yours? He has long been a friend in our family, and we expect a viſit from him ſhortly."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"My friend's firſt care,"</q> continued my ſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"was to alter my appearance by a very fine ſuit of his own cloaths, and then I was admitted to his table upon the footing of half-friend, half-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. My buſineſs was to attend him at auctions, to put him in ſpirits when he ſate for his picture, to take the left hand in his chariot when not filled by another, and to aſſiſt at tattering a kip, as the phraſe was, when we had a mind for a frolic. Beſide this, I had twenty other little employments in the family. I was to do many ſmall things without bidding; to carry the cork ſcrew; to ſtand godfather
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0657000202:15"/>
to all the butler's children; to ſing when I was bid; to be never out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; always to be humble, and, if I could, to be happy.<p>"In this honourable poſt, however, I was not without a rival. A captain of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, who ſeemed formed for the place by nature, oppoſed me in my patron's affections. His mother had been laundreſs to a man of quality, and thus he early acquired a taſte for pimping and pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. As this gentleman made it the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his life to be acquainted with lords, though he was diſmiſſed from ſeveral for his ſtupidity; yet he found many of them who permitted his aſſiduities, being as dull as himſelf. As flattery was his trade, he practiſed it with the eaſieſt addreſs imaginable; but it came aukward and ſtiff from me; and as every day my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's deſire of flattery encreaſed, ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour being better acquainted with his defects, I became more unwilling to give
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0657000202:16"/>
it. Thus I was once more fairly going to give up the field to the captain, when my friend found occaſion for my aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This was nothing leſs than to fight a duel for him, with a gentleman whoſe ſiſter it was pretended he had uſed ill. I readily complied with his requeſt, and tho' I ſee you are diſpleaſed at my conduct, yet as it was a debt indiſpenſably due to friendſhip, I could not refuſe. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the affair, diſarmed my antagoniſt, and ſoon after had the pleaſure of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the lady was only a woman of the town, and the fellow her bully and a ſharper. This piece of ſervice was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid with the warmeſt profeſſions of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; but as my friend was to leave town in a few days, he knew no other method to ſerve me, but by recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to his uncle Sir William Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, and another nobleman of great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, who enjoyed a poſt under the government. When he was gone, my firſt care was to carry his recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0657000202:17"/>
letter to his uncle, a man whoſe character for every virtue was univerſal, yet juſt. I was received by his ſervants with the moſt hoſpitable ſmiles; for the looks of the domeſtics ever tranſmit their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's benevolence. Being ſhewn into a grand apartment, where Sir William ſoon came to me, I delivered my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and letter, which he read, and after pauſing ſome minutes, Pray, Sir, cried he, inform me what you have done for my kinſman, to deſerve this warm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation? But I ſuppoſe, Sir, I gueſs at your merits, you have fought for him; and ſo you would expect a reward from me, for being the inſtrument of his vices. I wiſh, ſincerely wiſh, that my preſent refuſal may be ſome puniſhment for your guilt; but ſtill more, that it may be ſome inducement to your repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.—The ſeverity of this rebuke I bore patiently, becauſe I knew it was juſt. My whole expectations now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, lay in my letter to the great man.

As the doors of the nobility are almoſt ever beſet with beggars, all ready to thruſt in ſome ſly petition, I found it no eaſy matter to gain admittance. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after bribing the ſervants with half my worldly fortune, I was at laſt ſhewn into a ſpacious apartment, my letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing previouſly ſent up for his lordſhip's inſpection. During this anxious interval I had full time to look round me. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing was grand, and of happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance: the paintings, the furniture, the gildings, petrified me with awe, and raiſed my idea of the owner. Ah, thought I to myſelf, how very great muſt the poſſeſſor of all theſe things be, who carries in his head the buſineſs of the ſtate, and whoſe houſe diſplays half the wealth of a kingdom: ſure his genius muſt be unfathomable! During theſe awful reflections I heard a ſtep come heavily forward. Ah, this is the great man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! No, it was only a chambermaid. Another foot was heard ſoon after. This
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0657000202:19"/>
muſt be He! No, it was only the great man's valet de chambre. At laſt his lordſhip actually made his appearance. Are you, cried he, the bearer of this here letter? I anſwered with a bow. I learn by this, continued he, as how that—But juſt at that inſtant a ſervant delivered him a card, and without taking farther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he went out of the room, and left me to digeſt my own happineſs at leiſure. I ſaw no more of him, till told by a footman that his lordſhip was going to his coach at the door. Down I immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and joined my voice to that of three or four more, who came, like me, to petition for favours. His lordſhip, however, went too faſt for us, and was gaining his Chariot door with large ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, when I hallowed out to know if I was to have any reply. He was by this time got in, and muttered an anſwer, half of which only I heard, the other half was loſt in the rattling of his chariot wheels. I ſtood for ſome time with my neck
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0657000202:20"/>
ſtretched out, in the poſture of one that was liſtening to catch the glorious ſounds, till looking round me, I found myſelf alone at his lordſhip's gate.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"My patience,"</q> continued my ſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"was now quite exhauſted: ſtung with the thouſand indignities I had met with, I was willing to caſt myſelf away, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanted the gulph to receive me. I regarded myſelf as one of thoſe vile things that nature deſigned ſhould be thrown by into her lumber room, there to periſh in unpitied obſcurity. I had ſtill, however, half a guinea left, and of that I thought fortune herſelf ſhould not deprive me: but in order to be ſure of this, I was reſolved to go inſtantly and ſpend it while I had it, and then truſt to occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences for the reſt. As I was going along with this reſolution, it happened that Mr. Cripſe's office ſeemed invitingly open to give me a welcome reception. In this office Mr. Cripſe kindly offers all his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0657000202:21"/>
majeſty's ſubjects a generous promiſe of 30 l. a year, for which promiſe all they give in return is their liberty for life, and permiſſion to let him tranſport them to America as ſlaves. I was happy at find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place where I could loſe my fears in deſperation, and therefore entered this cell; for it had the appearance of one, being dark, damp, and dirty. Here I found a number of poor creatures, all in circumſtances like myſelf, expecting the arrival of Mr. Cripſe, preſenting a true epitome of Engliſh impatience. Each untractable ſoul at variance with fortune, wreaked her injuries on their own hearts: but Mr. Cripſe at laſt came down, and all our murmurs were huſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He deigned to regard me with an air of peculiar approbation, and indeed he was the firſt man who for a month paſt talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me with ſmiles. After a few queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he found I was fit for every thing in the world. He pauſed a while upon the propereſt means of providing for me,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0657000202:22"/>
and ſlapping his forehead, as if he had found it, aſſured me, that there was at that time an embaſſy talked of from the ſynod of Penſylvania to the Chickaſaw Indians, and that he would uſe his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to get me made ſecretary. I knew in my own heart that the fellow lied, and yet his promiſe gave me pleaſure, there was ſomething ſo magniſicent in the ſound. I fairly, therefore, divided my half guinea, one half of which went to be added to his thirty thouſand pound, and with the other half I reſolved to go to the next tavern, to be there more happy than he.<p>"As I was going out with that reſolution, I was met at the door by the captain of a ſhip, with whom I had formerly ſome little acquaintance, and he agreed to be my companion over a bowl of punch. As I never choſe to make a ſecret of my circumſtances, he aſſured me that I was upon the very point of ruin, in liſtening
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0657000202:23"/>
to the office-keeper's promiſes; for that he only deſigned to ſell me to the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. But, continued he, I fancy you might, by a much ſhorter voyage, be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily put into a genteel way of bread. Take my advice. My ſhip ſails to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Amſterdam; What if you go in her as a paſſenger? The moment you land all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen Engliſh, and I'll warrant you'll get pupils and money enough. I ſuppoſe you underſtand Engliſh, added he, by this time, or the deuce is in it. I confidently aſſured him of that; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a doubt whether the Dutch would be willing to learn Engliſh. He affirmed with an oath that they were fond of it to diſtraction; and upon that affirmation I agreed with his propoſal, and embarked the next day to teach the Dutch Engliſh in Holland. The wind was fair, our voyage ſhort, and after having paid my paſſage with half my moveables, I found myſelf, fallen as if from the ſkies, a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0657000202:24"/>
ſtranger in one of the principal ſtreets of Amſterdam. In this ſituation I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to let any time paſs unemployed in teaching. I addreſſed myſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to two or three of thoſe I met, whoſe appearance ſeemed moſt promiſing; but it was impoſſible to make ourſelves mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually underſtood. It was not till this very moment I recollected, that in order to teach Dutchmen Engliſh, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that they ſhould firſt teach me Dutch. How I came to overlook ſo obvious an objection, is to me amazing; but certain it is I overlooked it.</p>
                  <p>"This ſcheme thus blown up, I had ſome thoughts of fairly ſhipping back to England again; but happening into company with an Iriſh ſtudent, who was returning from Louvain, our converſation turning upon topics of literature, (for by the way it may be obſerved, that I always forgot the meanneſs of my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances when I could converſe upon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0657000202:25"/>
ſuch ſubjects) from him I learned that there were not two men in his whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity who underſtood Greek. This amazed me. I inſtangly reſolved to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to Louvain, and there live by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Greek; and in this deſign I was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by my brother ſtudent, who threw out ſome hints that a fortune might be got by it.</p>
                  <p>"I ſet boldly forward the next morning. Every day leſſened the burthen of my moveables, like Aeſop and his baſket of bread; for I paid them for my lodgings to the Dutch as I travelled on. When I came to Louvain, I was reſolved not to go ſneaking to the lower profeſſors, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly tendered my talents to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal himſelf. I went, had admittance, and offered him my ſervice as a maſter of the Greek language, which I had been told was a deſideratum in his univerſity. The <hi>principal</hi> ſeemed at firſt to doubt of my abilities; but of theſe I offered to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0657000202:26"/>
convince him, by turning a part of any Greek author he ſhould fix upon into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. Finding me perfectly earneſt in my propoſal, he addreſſed me thus: You ſee me, young man, continued he, I never learned Greek, and I don't find that I ever miſſed it. I have had a doctor's cap and gown without Greek: I have ten thouſand florins a year without Greek; and I eat heartily without Greek. In ſhort, continued he, I don't know Greek, and I do not believe there is any uſe in it.</p>
                  <p>"I was now too far from home to think of returning; ſo I reſolved to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. I had ſome knowledge of muſic, with a tolerable voice, and now turned what was once my amuſement into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent means of bare ſubſiſtence. I paſſed among the harmleſs peaſants of Flanders, and among ſuch of the French as were poor enough to be very merry; for I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0657000202:27"/>
ever found them ſprightly in proportion to their wants. Whenever I approached a peaſant's houſe towards night-fall, I played one of my moſt merry tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging, but ſubſiſtence for the next day. I once or twice attempted to play for people of faſhion; but they ſtill thought my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance odious, and never rewarded me even with a trifle. This was to me the more extraordinary, as whenever I uſed formerly to play for company, when playing was my amuſement, my muſic never failed to throw them into raptures, and the ladies eſpecially; but as it was now my only means, it was received with contempt: a proof how ready the world is to under rate thoſe talents which a man lives by.</p>
                  <p>"In this manner I proceeded to Paris, with no deſign but juſt to look about me, and then to go forward. The people of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0657000202:28"/>
Paris are much fonder of ſtrangers that have money, than of thoſe that have wit. You may imagine then, as I could not boaſt much of either, that I was no great favourite. After I had walked about the town four or five days, and ſeen the outſides of the beſt houſes, I was preparing to leave this retreat of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hoſpitality, when paſſing through one of the principal ſtreets, whom ſhould I meet but our couſin, to whom you firſt recommended me. This meeting was very agreeable to me, and I believe not diſpleaſing to him. He enquired into the nature of my journey to Paris, and informed me of his buſineſs there, which was to collect pictures, medals, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taglios, and antiques of all kinds, for a gentleman in London, who had juſt ſtept into taſte and a large fortune. I was ſtill more ſurpriſed at ſeeing our couſin pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon for this office, as himſelf had often aſſured me he knew nothing of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0657000202:29"/>
matter. Upon my aſking how he had been taught the art of a connoſcento ſo very ſuddenly, he aſſured me that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more eaſy. The whole ſecret conſiſted in a ſtrict adherence to two rules: the one always to obſerve, that the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might have been better if the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had taken more pains; and the other, to praiſe the works of Pietro Perugino. But, ſays he, as I once taught you how to be an author in London, I'll now undertake to inſtruct you in the art of picture buying at Paris.</p>
                  <p>"With this propoſal I very readily cloſed, as it was a living, and now all my ambition was to live. I went there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to his lodgings, improved my dreſs by his aſſiſtance, and after ſome time, accompanied him to auctions of pictures, where the Engliſh gentry were expected to be purchaſers. I was not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at his intimacy with people of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0657000202:30"/>
beſt faſhion, who referred themſelves to his judgment upon every picture or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, as to an unerring ſtandard of taſte. He made very good uſe of my aſſiſtance upon theſe occaſions; for when aſked his opinion, he would gravely take me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and aſk mine, ſhrug, look wiſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and aſſure the company, that he could give no opinion upon an affair of ſo much importance. Yet there was ſometimes an occaſion for a more ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported aſſurance. I remember to have ſeen him, after giving his opinion that the colouring of a picture was not mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low enough, very deliberately take a bruſh with brown varniſh, that was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally lying in the place, and rub it over the piece with great compoſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the company, and then aſk if he had not improved the tints.</p>
                  <p>"When he had finiſhed his commiſſion in Paris, he left me ſtrongly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0657000202:31"/>
to ſeveral men of diſtinction, as a perſon very proper for a travelling tutor; and I was after ſome time employed in that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city by a gentleman who brought his ward to Paris, in order to ſet him forward on his tour through Europe. I was to be the young gentleman's governor, with this injunction, that he ſhould always be permitted to direct himſelf. My pupil in fact underſtood the art of guiding in money concerns much better than me. He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thouſand pounds, left him by an uncle in the Weſt Indies; and his guardians, to qualify him for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of it, had bound him appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to an attorney. Thus avarice was his prevailing paſſion: all his queſtions on the road were how money might be ſaved, which was the leaſt expenſive courſe of travel; whether any thing could be bought that would turn to account when diſpoſed of again in London.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0657000202:32"/>
Such curioſities on the way as could be ſeen for nothing he was ready enough to look at; but if the ſight was to be paid for, he uſually aſſerted that he had been told it was not worth ſeeing. He never paid a bill, that he would not obſerve, how amazingly expenſive travelling was, and all this though he was not yet come to the age of twenty-one. When arrived at Leghorn, as we took a walk to look at the port and ſhipping, he enquired the expence of the paſſage by ſea home to England. This he was informed was but a trifle, compared to his returning by land, he was therefore unable to withſtand the temptation; ſo paying me the ſmall part of my ſalary that was then due, he took leave, and embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with only one attendant for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                  <p>"I now therefore was left once more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world at large; but then it was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0657000202:33"/>
a thing I was uſed to. However my ſkill in muſic could avail me nothing in a country where every peaſant was a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſician than I; but by this time I had acquired another talent, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my purpoſe as well, and this was a ſkill in diſputation. In all the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign univerſities and convents, there are upon certain days philoſophical theſes maintained againſt every adventitious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant; for which, if the champion op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes with any dexterity, he can claim a gratuity in money, a dinner, and a bed for one night. In this manner therefore I fought my way towards England, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along from city to city, examined mankind more nearly, and, if I may ſo expreſs it, ſaw both ſides of the picture. My remarks, however, were few: I found that monarchy was the beſt government for the poor to live in, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths for the rich. I found that riches in general were in every country another
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0657000202:34"/>
name for freedom; and that no man is ſo ſond of freedom himſelf that he would not chuſe to ſubject the will of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of ſociety to his own.</p>
                  <p>"Upon my arrival in England, I reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay my reſpects firſt to you, and then to enliſt as a volunteer in the firſt expedition that was ſent out; but on my journey down my reſolutions were changed, by meeting an old acquaintace, who I found belonged to a company of comedians, that were going to make a ſummer campaign in the country. The company ſeemed not much to diſapprove of me for an aſſociate. They all, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, apprized me of the importance of the taſk at which I aimed; that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic was a many headed monſter, and that only ſuch as had very good heads could pleaſe it: that acting was not to be learnt in a day; and that without ſome traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſhrugs, which had been on the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0657000202:35"/>
ſtage, and only on the ſtage, theſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, I could never pretend to pleaſe. The next difficulty was in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me with parts, as almoſt every cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was in keeping. I was driven for ſome time from one character to another, till at laſt Horatio was fixed upon, which the preſence of the preſent company happily hindered me from acting."</p>

            </argument>
            <p>MY ſon's account was too long to be delivered at once, the firſt part of it was begun that night, and he was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the reſt after dinner the next day, when the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page at the door ſeemed to make a pauſe in the general ſatisfaction. The but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who was now become my friend in the family, informed me with a whiſper, that the 'Squire had already made ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to Miſs Wilmot, and that her aunt and uncle ſeemed highly to approve the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0657000202:37"/>
match. Upon Mr. Thornhill's entering, he ſeemed, at ſeeing my ſon and me, to ſtart back; but I readily imputed that to ſurprize, and not diſpleaſure. However, upon our advancing to ſalute him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned our greeting with the moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent candour; and after a ſhort time, his preſence ſeemed only to encreaſe the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good humour.</p>
            <p>After tea he called me aſide, to enquire after my daughter; but upon my informing him that my enquiry was unſucceſsful, he ſeemed greatly ſurpriſed; adding, that he had been ſince frequently at my houſe, in order to comfort the reſt of my family, whom he left perfectly well. He then aſked if I had communicated her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to Miſs Wilmot, or my ſon; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my replying that I had not told them as yet, he greatly approved my prudence and precaution, deſiring me by all means to keep it a ſecret: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"For at beſt,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"it is but divulging one's own infamy;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0657000202:38"/>
and perhaps Miſs Livy may not be ſo guilty as we all imagine."</q> We were here interrupted by a ſervant, who came to aſk the 'Squire in, to ſtand up at country dances; ſo that he left me quite pleaſed with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt he ſeemed to take in my concerns. His addreſſes, however, to Miſs Wilmot, were too obvious to be miſtaken; and yet ſhe ſeemed not perfectly pleaſed, but bore them rather in compliance to the will of her aunt, than from real inclination. I had even the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to ſee her laviſh ſome kind looks upon my unfortunate ſon, which the other could neither extort by his fortune nor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity. Mr. Thornhill's ſeeming compoſure, however, not a little ſurpriſed me: we had now continued here a week, at the preſſing inſtances of Mr. Arnold; but each day the more tenderneſs Miſs Wilmot ſhewed my ſon, Mr. Thornhill's friendſhip ſeemed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to encreaſe for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0657000202:39"/>
He had formerly made us the moſt kind aſſurances of uſing his intereſt to ſerve the family; but now his generoſity was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to promiſes alone: the morning I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for my departure, Mr. Thornhill came to me with looks of real pleaſure to inform me of a piece of ſervice he had done for his friend George. This was nothing leſs than his having procured him an enſign's commiſſion in one of the regiments that was going to the Weſt Indies, for which he had promiſed but one hundred pounds, his intereſt having been ſufficient to get an abatement of the other two. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As for this trifling piece of ſervice,"</q> continued the young gentleman, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I deſire no other reward but the pleaſure of having ſerved my friend; and as for the hundred pound to be paid, if you are unable to raiſe it yourſelves, I will advance it, and you ſhall repay me at your leiſure."</q> This was a favour we wanted words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our ſenſe of: I readily therefore gave my bond for the money, and teſtified
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0657000202:40"/>
as much gratitude as if I never intended to pay.</p>
            <p>George was to depart for town the next day to ſecure his commiſſion, in purſuance of his generous patron's directions, who judged it highly expedient to uſe diſpatch, leſt in the mean time another ſhould ſtep in with more advantageous propoſals. The next morning, therefore, our young ſoldier was early prepared for his departure, and ſeemed the only perſon among us that was not affected by it. Neither the fatigues and dangers he was going to encounter, nor the friends and miſtreſs, for Miſs Wilmot actually loved him, he was leaving behind, any way damped his ſpirits. After he had taken leave of the reſt of the company, I gave him all I had, my bleſſing. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And now, my boy,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"thou art going to fight for thy country, remember how thy brave grandfather fought for his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred king, when loyalty among Britons was a virtue. Go, my boy, and immitate
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0657000202:41"/>
him in all but his misfortunes, if it was a misfortune to die with Lord Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Go, my boy, and if you fall, tho' diſtant, expoſed and unwept by thoſe that love you, the moſt precious tears are thoſe with which heaven bedews the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried head of a ſoldier."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning I took leave of the good family, that had been kind enough to entertain me ſo long, not without ſeveral expreſſions of gratitude to Mr. Thornhill for his late bounty. I left them in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all that happineſs which afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and good breeding procure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned towards home, deſpairing of ever finding my daughter more, but ſending a ſigh to heaven to ſpare and to forgive her. I was now come within about twenty miles of home, having hired an horſe to carry me, as I was yet but weak, and comforted myſelf with the hopes of ſoon ſeeing all I held deareſt upon earth. But the night
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0657000202:42"/>
coming on, I put up at a little public-houſe by the road-ſide, and aſked for the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord's company over a pint of wine. We ſate beſide his kitchen fire, which was the beſt room in the houſe, and chatted on po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics and the news of the country. We happened, among other topics, to talk of young 'Squire Thornhill, whom the hoſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me was hated as much as an uncle of his, who ſometimes came down to the country, was loved. He went on to obſerve, that he made it his whole ſtudy to betray the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch as received him to their houſes, and after a fortnight or three weeks poſſeſſion, he turned them out unrewarded and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to the world. As we continued our diſcourſe in this manner, his wife, who had been out to get change, returned, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that her huſband was enjoying a pleaſure in which ſhe was not a ſharer, ſhe aſked him, in an angry tone, what he did there, to which he only replied in an ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way, by drinking her health. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Mr.

to a room over-head, and I ſoon perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the loudneſs of her voice, and the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of her reproaches, that no money was to be had from her lodger.

               <p>Offences are eaſily pardoned where there is love at bottom.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE next morning I took my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter behind me, and ſet out on my return home. As we travelled along, I ſtrove, by every perſuaſion, to calm her ſorrows and fears, and to arm her with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to bear the preſence of her offended mother. I took every opportunity, from the proſpect of a fine country, through which we paſſed, to obſerve how much kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven was to us, than we were to each other, and that the misfortunes of nature's making were very few. I aſſured her, that ſhe ſhould never perceive any change in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0657000202:56"/>
my affections, and that during my life, which yet might be long, ſhe might depend upon a guardian and an inſtructor. I armed her againſt the cenſures of the world, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her that books were ſweet unreproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing companions to the miſerable, and that if they could not bring us to enjoy life, they would teach us to endure it.</p>
            <p>The hired horſe that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn by the way, within about five miles from my houſe, and as I was willing to prepare my family for my daughter's reception, I determined to leave her that night at the inn, and to come for her, accompanied by my daughter So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, early the next morning. It was night before we reached our appointed ſtage: however, after ſeeing her provided with a decent apartment, and having ordered the hoſteſs to prepare proper refreſhments, I kiſſed her, and proceeded towards home. My heart caught new ſenſations of pleaſure
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0657000202:57"/>
the nearer I approached that peaceful manſion. As a bird that has been fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its neſt, my affections out-went my haſte, and hovered round my little fire-ſide, with all the rapture of expectation. I called up the many fond things I had to ſay, and anticipated the welcome I was to receive. I already felt my wife's tender em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and ſmiled at the joy of my little ones. As I walked but ſlowly, the night wained apace. The labourers of the day were all retired to reſt; the lights were out in every cottage; no ſounds were heard but of the ſhrilling cock, and the deep-mouthed watch-dog, at hollow diſtance. I approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my little abode of pleaſure, and before I was within a furlong of the place, our honeſt maſtiff came running to welcome me.</p>
            <p>It was now near mid-night that I came to knock at my door: all was ſtill and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: my heart dilated with unutterable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0657000202:58"/>
when, to my amazement, the houſe was burſting out in a blaze of fire, and every apperture was red with conflagration! I gave a loud convulſive outcry, and fell upon the pavement inſenſible. This alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſon, who perceiving the flames, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly waked my wife and daughter, and all running out, naked, and wild with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, recalled me to life with their anguiſh. But it was only to objects of new terror; for the flames had, by this time, caught the roof of our dwelling, part after part continuing to fall in, while the family ſtood, with ſilent agony, looking on, as if they enjoyed the blaze. I gazed upon them and upon it by turns, and then looked round me for my two little ones; but they were not to be ſeen. O miſery! <q rend="inline">"Where,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"where are my little ones?"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"They are burnt to death in the flames,"</q> ſays my wife calmly, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"and I will die with them."</q>—That moment I heard the cry of the babes within, who were juſt awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0657000202:59"/>
by the fire, and nothing could have ſtopped me. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Where, where, are my children?"</q> cried I, ruſhing through the flames, and burſting the door of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in which they were confined, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Where are my little ones?"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Here, dear papa, here we are,"</q> cried they together, while the flames were juſt catching the bed where they lay. I caught them both in my arms, and ſnatched them through the fire as faſt as poſſible, while juſt as I was got out, the roof ſunk in. <q rend="inline">"Now,"</q> cried I, holding up my children, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"now let the flames burn on, and all my poſſeſſions periſh. Here they are, I have ſaved my treaſure. Here, my deareſt, here are our treaſures, and we ſhall yet be happy."</q> We kiſſed our little darlings a thouſand times, they claſped us round the neck, and ſeemed to ſhare our tranſports, while their mother laughed and wept by turns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0657000202:60"/>
I now ſtood a calm ſpectator of the flames, and after ſome time, began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that my arm to the ſhoulder was ſcorched in a terrible manner. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of my power to give my ſon any aſſiſtance, either in attempting to fave our goods, or preventing the flames ſpreading to our corn. By this time, the neighbours were alarmed, and came running to our aſſiſtance; but all they could do was to ſtand, like us, ſpectators of the calamity. My goods, among which were the notes I had reſerved for my daughters fortunes, were entirely conſumed, except a box, with ſome papers, that ſtood in the kitchen, and two or three things more of little conſequence, which my ſon brought away in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The neighbours contributed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, what they could to lighten our diſtreſs. They brought us cloaths, and furniſhed one of our out-houſes with kitchen utenſils; ſo that by day-light we had another, tho' a wretched, dwelling to retire to. My honeſt next
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0657000202:61"/>
neighbour, and his children, were not the leaſt aſſiduous in providing us with every thing neceſſary, and offering what ever conſolation untutored benevolence could ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>When the fears of my family had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, curioſity to know the cauſe of my long ſtay began to take place; having therefore informed them of every particular, I proceeded to prepare them for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our loſt one, and tho' we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wretchedneſs now to impart, yet to procure her a welcome to what we had. This taſk would have been more difficult but for our recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions. Being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to go for my poor child myſelf, as my arm now grew very painful, I ſent my ſon and daughter, who ſoon returned, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wretched delinquent, who had not courage to look up at her mother, whom
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0657000202:62"/>
no inſtructions of mine could perſuade to a perfect reconciliation; for women have a much ſtronger ſenſe of female error than men. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Ah, madam,"</q> cried her mother, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"this is but a poor place you are come to after ſo much finery. My daughter So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and I can afford but little enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to perſons who have kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany only with people of diſtinction. Yes, Miſs Livy, your poor father and I have ſuffered very much of late; but I hope heaven will forgive you."</q>—During this reception, the unhappy victim ſtood pale and trembling, unable to weep or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; but I could not continue a ſilent ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of her diſtreſs, wherefore aſſuming a degree of ſeverity in my voice and manner, which was ever followed with inſtant ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I entreat, woman, that my words may be now marked once for all: I have here brought you back a poor deluded wanderer; her return to duty demands the revival of our tenderneſs.

real hardſhips of life are now coming faſt upon us, let us not therefore encreaſe them by diſſention among each other. If we live harmoniouſly together, we may yet be contented, as there are enough of us here to ſhut out the cenſuring world, and keep each other in countenance. The kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heaven is promiſed to the penitent, and let ours be directed by the example. Heaven, we are aſſured, is much more pleaſed to view a repentant ſinner, than many perſons who have ſupported a courſe of undeviating rectitude. And this is right; for that ſingle effort by which we ſtop ſhort in the down-hill path to perdition, is itſelf a greater exertion of virtue, than an hundred acts of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice."</q>

            <p>SOME aſſiduity was now required to make our preſent abode as convenient as poſſible, and we were ſoon again qualified to enjoy our former ſerenity. Being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled myſelf from aſſiſting my ſon in our uſual occupations, I read to my family from the few books that were ſaved, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from ſuch, as, by amuſing the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, contributed to eaſe the heart. Our good neighbours too came every day with the kindeſt condolence, and fixed a time in which they were all to aſſiſt at repairing my former dwelling. Honeſt farmer Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams

was not laſt among theſe viſitors; but heartily offered his friendſhip. He would even have renewed his addreſſes to my daughter; but ſhe rejected them in ſuch a manner as totally repreſt his future ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations. Her grief ſeemed formed for continuing, and ſhe was the only perſon of our little ſociety that a week did not reſtore to chearfulneſs. She now loſt that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bluſhing innocence which once taught her to reſpect herſelf, and to ſeek pleaſure by pleaſing. Anxeity now had taken ſtrong poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her mind, her beauty began to be impaired with her conſtitution, and neglect ſtill more contributed to diminiſh it. Every tender epithet beſtowed on her ſiſter brought a pang to her heart and a tear to her eye; and as one vice, tho' cured, almoſt ever plants others where it has been, ſo her former guilt, tho' driven out by repentance, left jealouſy and envy behind. I ſtrove a thouſand ways to leſſen her care, and even forgot my own pain in a concern for her's,

If ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample be neceſſary to prove this, I'll give you a ſtory, my child, told us by a grave, tho' ſometimes a romancing, hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian.<p>"Matilda was married very young to a Neapolitan nobleman of the firſt quality, and found herſelf a widow and a mother at the age of fifteen. As ſhe ſtood one day careſſing her infant ſon in the open window of an apartment, which hung over the river Volturna, the child, with a ſudden ſpring, leaped from her arms into the flood below, and diſappeared in a moment. The mother, ſtruck with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſurprize, and making an effort to ſave him, plunged in after; but, far
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0657000202:67"/>
from being able to aſſiſt the infant, ſhe herſelf with great difficulty eſcaped to the oppoſite ſhore, juſt when ſome French ſoldiers were plundering the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on that ſide, who immediately made her their priſoner.</p>
                  <p>"As the war was then carried on between the French and Italians with the utmoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity, they were going at once to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate thoſe two extremes, ſuggeſted by appetite and cruelty. This baſe reſolution, however, was oppoſed by a young offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who, tho' their retreat required the utmoſt expedition, placed her behind him, and brought her in ſafety to his native city. Her beauty at firſt caught his eye, her merit ſoon after his heart. They were married; he roſe to the higheſt poſts; they lived long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and were happy. But the felicity of a ſoldier can never be called perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: after an interval of ſeveral years,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0657000202:68"/>
the troops which he commanded having met with a repulſe, he was obliged to take ſhelter in the city where he had lived with his wife. Here they ſuffered a ſiege, and the city at length was taken. Few hiſtories can produce more various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of cruelty, than thoſe which the French and Italians at that time exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon each other. It was reſolved by the victors, upon this occaſion, to put all the French priſoners to death; but particularly the huſband of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Matilda, as he was principally inſtrumental in protracting the ſiege. Their determinations were, in general, executed almoſt as ſoon as reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The captive ſoldier was led forth, and the executioner, with his ſword, ſtood ready, while the ſpectators in gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſilence awaited the fatal blow, which was only ſuſpended till the general, who preſided as judge, ſhould give the ſignal. It was in this interval of anguiſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0657000202:69"/>
pectation, that Matilda came to take her laſt farewell of her huſband and deliverer, deploring her wretched ſituation, and the cruelty of fate, that had ſaved her from periſhing by a premature death in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Volturna, to be the ſpectator of ſtill greater calamities. The general, who was a young man, was ſtruck with ſurprize at her beauty, and pity at her diſtreſs; but with ſtill ſtronger emotions when he heard her mention her former dangers. He was her ſon, the infant for whom ſhe had encounter'd ſo much danger. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged her at once as his mother, and fell at her feet. The reſt may be eaſily ſuppoſed: the captive was ſet free, and all the happineſs that love, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and duty could confer on each, were united."</p>

            </p>
            <p>In this manner I would attempt to amuſe my daughter; but ſhe liſtened with divided attention; for her own misfortunes engroſſed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0657000202:70"/>
the pity ſhe once had for thoſe of another, and nothing gave her eaſe. In company ſhe dreaded contempt; and in ſolitude ſhe only found anxiety. Such was the colour of her wretchedneſs, when we received certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that Mr. Thornhill was going to be married to Miſs Wilmot, for whom I always ſuſpected he had a real paſſion, tho' he took every opportunity before me to expreſs his contempt both of her perſon and fortune. This news only ſerved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe poor Olivia's affliction; ſuch a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant breach of fidelity, was more than her courage could ſupport. I was reſolved, however, to get more certain information, and to defeat, if poſſible, the completion of his deſigns, by ſending my ſon to old Mr. Wilmot's, with inſtructions to know the truth of the report, and to deliver Miſs Wilmot a letter, intimating Mr. Thornhill's conduct in my family. My ſon went, in purſuance of my directions, and in three days returned, aſſuring us of the truth of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0657000202:71"/>
the acount; but that he had found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to deliver the letter, which he was therefore obliged to leave, as Mr. Thornhill and Miſs Wilmot were viſiting round the country. They were to be married, he ſaid, in a few days, having appeared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at church the Sunday before he was there, in great ſplendour, the bride attended by ſix young ladies dreſt in white, and he by as many gentlemen. Their approaching nuptials filled the whole country with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, and they uſually rode out together in the grandeſt equipage that had been ſeen in the country for many years. All the friends of both families, he ſaid, were there, particularly the 'Squire's uncle, Sir William Thornhill, who bore ſo good a character. He added, that nothing but mirth and feaſting were going forward; that all the country praiſed the young bride's beauty, and the bridegroom's fine perſon, and that they were immenſely fond of each other; concluding, that he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0657000202:72"/>
could not help thinking Mr. Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill one of the moſt happy men in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Why let him if he can,"</q> returned I: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"but, my ſon, obſerve this bed of ſtraw, and unſheltering roof; thoſe mouldering walls, and humid floor; my wretched body thus diſabled by fire, and my children weeping round me for bread; you have come home, my child, to all this, yet here, even here, you ſee a man that would not for a thouſand worlds exchange ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.

            <p>My compaſſion for my poor daughter, overpowered by this new diſaſter, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted what I had farther to obſerve. I bade her mother ſupport her, and after a ſhort time ſhe recovered. She appeared from this time more calm, and I imagined had gained a new degree of reſolution: but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances deceived me; for her tranquility was the langour of over-wrought reſentment. A ſupply of proviſions, charitably ſent us by my kind pariſhioners, ſeemed to diffuſe chearfulneſs amongſt the reſt of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, nor was I diſpleaſed at ſeeing them once more ſprightly and at eaſe.

ſatisfactions, merely to condole with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute melancholy, or to burthen them with a ſadneſs they did not feel.

to my intended marriage, it is not ſo eaſy to be done. And then my ſteward talks of driving for the rent: it is certain he knows his duty; for I never trouble myſelf with affairs of that nature. Yet ſtill I could wiſh to ſerve you, and even to have you and your daughter preſent at my marriage, which is ſhortly to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized with Miſs Wilmot; it is even the requeſt of my charming Arabella herſelf, whom I hope you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe."</q>

            <p>My wife and ſon, who were preſent at this interview, ſeemed terrified with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. My daughters alſo, finding that he was gone, came out to be informed of the reſult of our conference, which, when known, alarmed them not leſs than the reſt. But as to myſelf, I diſregarded

the utmoſt ſtretch of his malevolence: he had already ſtruck the blow, and now I ſtood prepared to repel every new ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Like one of thoſe inſtruments uſed in the art of war, which, however thrown, ſtill preſents a point to receive the enemy.</p>
            <p>We ſoon, however, found that he had not threatened in vain; for the very next day his ſteward came to demand my annual rent, which, by the train of accidents al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready related, I was unable to pay. The conſequence of my incapacity was his dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my cattle that evening, and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appraiſed and ſold the next day for leſs than half their value. My wife and children now therefore entreated me to comply upon any terms, rather than incur certain deſtruction. They even begged of me to admit his viſits once more, and uſed all their little eloquence to paint the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I was going to endure. The terrors of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0657000202:83"/>
a priſon, in ſo rigorous a ſeaſon as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with the danger that threatened my health from the late accident that happened by the fire. But I continued inflexible.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Why, my treaſures,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"why will you thus attempt to perſuade me to the thing that is not right! My duty has taught me to forgive him; but my conſcience will not permit me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. Would you have me applaud to the world what my heart muſt internally condemn? Would you have me tamely ſit down and flatter our infamous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer; and to avoid a priſon continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer the more galling bonds of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal confinement! No, never. If we are to be taken from this abode, only let us hold to the right, and wherever we are thrown, we can ſtill retire to a charming apartment, and look round our

            <p>In this manner we ſpent that evening. Early the next morning, as the ſnow had fallen in great abundance in the night, my ſon was employed in clearing it away, and opening a paſſage before the door. He had not been thus engaged long, when he came running in, with looks all pale, to tell us that two ſtrangers, whom he knew to be officers of juſtice, were making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the houſe.</p>
            <p>Juſt as he ſpoke they came in, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the bed where I lay, after previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly informing me of their employment and buſineſs, made me their priſoner, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me prepare to go with them to the county gaol, which was eleven miles off.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"My friends,"</q> ſaid I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"this is ſevere weather on which you have come to

            <p>WE ſet forward from this peaceful neighbourhood, and walked on ſlowly. My eldeſt daughter being enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by a ſlow fever, which had begun for ſome days to undermine her conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one of the officers, who had an horſe, kindly took her behind him; for even theſe men cannot entirely diveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of humanity. My ſon led one of the little ones by the hand, and my wife the other, while I leaned upon my youngeſt girl, whoſe tears fell not for her own but my diſtreſſes.</p>

We were now got from my late dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about two miles, when we ſaw a crowd running and ſhouting behind us, conſiſting of about fifty of my pooreſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners. Theſe, with dreadful impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſoon ſeized upon the two officers of juſtice, and ſwearing they would never ſee their miniſter go to gaol while they had a drop of blood to ſhed in his defence, were going to uſe them with great ſeverity. The conſequence might have been fatal, had I not immediately interpoſed, and with ſome difficulty reſcued the officers from the hands of the enraged multitude. My chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who looked upon my delivery now as certain, appeared tranſported with joy, and were incapable of containing their rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But they were ſoon undeceived, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hearing me addreſs the poor deluded people, who came, as they imagined, to do me ſervice.</p>

               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What! my friends,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"and is this the way you love me!

Alas! my dear deluded flock, return back to the duty you owe to God, to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to me.

            </p>
            <p>They now ſeemed all repentance, and melting into tears, came one after the other to bid me farewell. I ſhook each tenderly by the hand, and leaving them my bleſſing, proceeded forward without meeting any
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0657000202:90"/>
farther interruption. Some hours before night we reached the town, or rather vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; for it conſiſted but of a few mean houſes, having loſt all its former opulence, and retaining no marks of its ancient ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority but the gaol.</p>
            <p>Upon entering, we put up at an inn, where we had ſuch refreſhments as could moſt readily be procured, and I ſupped with my family with my uſual chearfulneſs. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeeing them properly accommodated for that night, I next attended the ſheriff's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to the priſon, which had formerly been built for the purpoſes of war, and conſiſted of one large apartment, ſtrongly grated, and paved with ſtone, common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in the four and twenty. Beſides this, every priſoner had a ſeparate cell, where he was locked in for the night.</p>
            <p>I expected upon my entrance to find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but lamentations, and various ſounds

of miſery; but it was very different. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſeemed all employed in one common deſign, that of forgetting thought in merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or clamour. I was apprized of the uſual perquiſite required upon theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and immediately complied with the demand, though the little money I had was very near being all exhauſted. This was immediately ſent away for liquor, and the whole priſon ſoon was filled with riot, laughter, and prophaneneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"How,"</q> cried I to myſelf, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"ſhall men ſo very wicked be chearful, and ſhall I be melancholy! I feel only the ſame confinement with them, and I think I have more reaſon to be happy."</q>
            </p>
            <p>With ſuch reflections I laboured to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come chearful; but chearfulneſs was never yet produced by effort, which is itſelf pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. As I was ſitting therefore in a corner of the gaol, in a penſive poſture, one of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0657000202:92"/>
my fellow priſoners came up, and ſitting by me, entered into converſation. It was my conſtant rule in life never to avoid the converſation of any man who ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it: for if good, I might profit by his inſtruction; if bad, he might be aſſiſted by mine. I found this to be a knowing man, of ſtrong unlettered ſenſe; but a thorough knowledge of the world, as it is called, or, more properly ſpeaking, of human nature on the wrong ſide. He aſked me if I had taken care to provide myfelf with a bed, which was a circumſtance I had never once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That's unfortunate,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"as you are allowed here nothing but ſtraw, and your apartment is very large and cold. However you ſeem to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a gentleman, and as I have been one myſelf in my time, part of my bed-cloaths are heartily at your ſervice."</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0657000202:93"/>
I thanked him, profeſſing my ſurprize at finding ſuch humanity in a gaol in misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; adding, to let him ſee that I was a ſcholar, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the ſage ancient ſeemed to underſtand the value of company in afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he ſaid, Ton koſmon aire, ei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dos ton etairon; and in fact,"</q> continued I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"what is the World if it affords only ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?"</q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You talk of the world, Sir,"</q> returned my fellow priſoner; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>the world is in its dotage, and yet the coſmogony or creation of the world has puzzled the philoſophers of every age.

               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Well, ſir,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"all the return I can make ſhall be yours. You ſhall have more than half my bed-cloaths to night, and I'll take care to ſtand your friend in the priſon, where I think I have ſome influence."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I thanked him, and could not avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurpriſed at the preſent youthful change in his aſpect; for at the time I had ſeen him before he appeared at leaſt ſixty.—<q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0657000202:96"/>
anſwered he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"you are little acquainted with the world; I had at that time falſe hair, and have learnt the art of counterfeiting every age from ſeventeen to ſeventy.

            <p>We were now prevented from further converſation, by the arrival of the gaoler's ſervants, who came to call over the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners names, and lock up for the night.

            </argument>
            <p>THE next morning early I was awakened by my family, whom I found in tears at my bed-ſide. The gloomy ſtrength of every thing about us, it ſeems, had daunted them. I gently rebuked their ſorrow, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring them I had never ſlept with greater tranquility, and next enquired after my eldeſt daughter, who was not among them. They informed me that yeſterday's uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fatigue had encreaſed her fever, and it was judged proper to leave her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. My next care was to ſend my ſon to procure a room or two to lodge the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0657000202:99"/>
family in, as near the priſon as conveniently could be found. He obeyed; but could only find one apartment, which was hired at a ſmall expence, for his mother and ſiſters, the gaoler with humanity conſenting to let him and his two little brothers lie in the priſon with me. A bed was therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them in a corner of the room, which I thought anſwered very convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I was willing however previouſly to know whether my little children choſe to lie in a place which ſeemed to fright them upon entrance.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"my good boys, how do you like your bed? I hope you are not afraid to lie in this room, dark as it appears."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"No, papa,"</q> ſays Dick, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am not afraid to lie any where where you are."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0657000202:100"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And I,"</q> ſays Bill, who was yet but four years old, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"love every place beſt that my papa is in."</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this, I allotted to each of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily what they were to do. My daughter was particularly directed to watch her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining ſiſter's health; my wife was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend me; my little boys were to read to me: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And as for you, my ſon,"</q> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"it is by the labour of your hands we muſt all hope to be ſupported. Your wages, as a day-labourer, will be full ſufficient, with proper frugality, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us all, and comfortably too. Thou art now ſixteen years old, and haſt ſtrength, and it was given thee, my ſon, for very uſeful purpoſes; for it muſt ſave from famine your helpleſs parents and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Prepare then this evening to look out for work againſt to-morrow, and bring home every night what money you earn, for our ſupport."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0657000202:101"/>
Having thus inſtructed him, and ſettled the reſt, I walked down to the common pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where I could enjoy more air and room. But I was not long there when the execrations, lewdneſs, and brutality that invaded me on every ſide, drove me back to my apartment again. Here I ſate for ſome time, pondering upon the ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation of wretches, who finding all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in open arms againſt them, were, however, labouring to make themſelves a future and a tremendous enemy.</p>
            <p>Their inſenſibility excited my higheſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and blotted my own uneaſineſs a while from my mind. It even appeared as a duty incumbent upon me to attempt to reclaim them. I reſolved therefore once more to return, and in ſpite of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to give them my advice, and conquer them by perſeverance. Going therefore among them again, I informed Mr. Jenkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my deſign, at which he laughed,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0657000202:102"/>
but communicated it to the reſt. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was received with the greateſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humour, as it promiſed to afford a new fund of entertainment to perſons who had now no other reſource for mirth, but what could be derived from ridicule or debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
            <p>I therefore read them a portion of the ſervice with a loud unaffected voice, and found my audience perfectly merry upon the occaſion. Lewd whiſpers, groans of contrition burleſqued, winking and cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, alternately excited laughter. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I continued with my natural ſolemnity to read on, ſenſible that what I did might amend ſome, but could itſelf receive no contamination from any.</p>
            <p>After reading, I entered upon my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, which was rather calculated at firſt to amuſe them than to reprove. I previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved, that no other motive but
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0657000202:103"/>
their welfare could induce me to this; that I was their fellow priſoner, and now gained nothing by preaching. I was ſorry, I ſaid, to hear them ſo very prophane; becauſe they got nothing by it, but might loſe a great deal: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"For be aſſured, my friends,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"for you are my friends, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the world may diſclaim your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though you ſwore twelve thouſand oaths in a day, it would not put one penny in your purſe. Then what ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies calling every moment upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and courting his friendſhip, ſince you find how ſcurvily he uſes you. He has given you nothing here, you find, but a mouthful of oaths and an empty belly; and by the beſt accounts. I have of him, he will give you nothing that's good hereafter.<p>"If uſed ill in our dealings with one man, we naturally go elſewhere. Were it not worth your while then, juſt to try
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0657000202:104"/>
how you may like the uſage of another maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who gives you fair promiſes at leaſt to come to him. Surely, my Friends, of all ſtupidity in the world, his muſt be greateſt, who, after robbing an houſe, runs to the thieftakers for protection. And yet how are you more wiſe? You are all ſeeking comfort from him that has already betrayed you, applying to a more malicious being than any thieftaker of them all; for they only decoy, and then hang you; but he decoys and hangs, and what is worſt of all, will not let you looſe after the hangman has done."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>When I had concluded, I received the compliments of my audience, ſome of whom came and ſhook me by the hand, ſwearing that I was a very honeſt fellow, and that they deſired my further acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. I therefore promiſed to repeat my lecture next day, and actually conceived
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0657000202:105"/>
ſome hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was paſt the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the ſhafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim. When I had thus ſatisfied my mind, I went back to my apartment, where my wife had prepared a frugal meal, while Mr. Jenkinson begged leave to add his dinner to ours, and partake of the pleaſure, as he was kind enough to expreſs it, of my converſation. He had not yet ſeen my family, for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, already deſcribed, by this means they avoided the common priſon. Jenkinſon at the firſt interview therefore ſeemed not a little ſtruck with the beauty of my young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt daughter, which her penſive air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to heighten, and my little ones did not paſs unnoticed.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Alas, Doctor,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are too handſome and too good for ſuch a place as this!"</q>

               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Why, Mr. Jenkinſon,"</q> replied I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"thank heaven my children are pretty tolerable in morals, and if they be good, it matters little for the reſt."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, ſir,"</q> returned my fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that it muſt give you great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to have this little family about you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"A comfort, Mr. Jenkinſon,"</q> replied I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"yes it is indeed a comfort, and I would not be without them for all the world; for they can make a dungeon ſeem a palace. There is but one way in this life of wounding my happineſs, and that is by injuring them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am afraid then, ſir,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that I am in ſome meaſure culpable; for I think I ſee here</q> (looking at my ſon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"one that I have injured, and by whom I wiſh to be forgiven."</q>

My ſon immediately recollected his voice and features, though he had before ſeen him in diſguiſe, and taking him by the hand, with a ſmile forgave him. <q rend="inline">"Yet,"</q> continued he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I can't help wondering at what you could ſee in my face, to think me a proper mark for deception."</q>

            <p>THE next morning I communicated to my wife and children the ſcheme I had planned of reforming the priſoners, which they received with univerſal diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, alledging the impoſſibility and impropriety of it; adding, that my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours would no way contribute to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, but might probably diſgrace my calling.</p>

            <p>Thus ſaying, I left them, and deſcended to the common priſon, where I found the priſoners very merry, expecting my arrival; and each prepared with ſome gaol trick to play upon the doctor.

A ſecond, who ſtood at ſome diſtance, had a knack of ſpitting through his teeth, which fell in ſhowers upon my book. A third would cry amen in ſuch an affected tone as gave the reſt great delight.

But there was one whoſe trick gave more univerſal pleaſure than all the reſt; for obſerving the manner in which I had diſpoſed my books on the table before me, he very dextrouſly diſplaced one of them, and put an obſcene jeſt-book of his own in the place.

               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0657000202:114"/>
It was now that I applauded my perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and addreſs, at thus giving ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to wretches diveſted of every moral feeling, and now began to think of doing them temporal ſervices alſo, by rendering their ſituation ſomewhat more comfortable. Their time had hitherto been divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween famine and exceſs, tumultous riot and bitter repining. Their only employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was quarrelling among each other, playing cribbage, and cutting tobacco ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. From this laſt mode of idle induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try I took the hint of ſetting ſuch as choſe to work at cutting pegs for tobacconiſts and ſhoemakers, the proper wood being bought by a general ſubſcription, and when manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured, ſold by my appointment; ſo that each earned ſomething every day: a trifle indeed, but ſufficient to maintain him.</p>
            <p>I did not ſtop here, but inſtituted fines or the puniſhment of immorality, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for peculiar induſtry. Thus in leſs
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0657000202:115"/>
than a fortnight I had formed them into ſomething ſocial and humane, and had the pleaſure of regarding myſelf as a legiſlator, who had brought men from their native fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity into friendſhip and obedience.</p>
            <p>And it were highly to be wiſhed, that legiſlative power would thus direct the law rather to reformation than ſeverity. That it would appear convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments familiar, but formidable. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of our preſent priſons, which find or make men guilty, which encloſe wretches for the commiſſion of one crime, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them, if returned alive, fitted for the perpetuation of thouſands; it were to be wiſhed we had, as in other parts of Europe, places of penitence and ſolitude, where the accuſed might be attended by ſuch as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives to virtue if innocent. And this, but not the increaſing puniſhments, is the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0657000202:116"/>
way to mend a ſtate: nor can I avoid even queſtioning the validity of that right which ſocial combinations have aſſumed of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally puniſhing offences of a ſlight nature. In caſes of murder their right is obvious, as it is the duty of us all, from the law of ſelf-defence, to cut off that man who has ſhewn a diſregard for the life of another. Againſt ſuch, all nature riſes in arms; but it is not ſo againſt him who ſteals my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. Natural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the horſe he ſteals is as much his property as mine. If then I have any right, it muſt be from a compact made between us, that he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives the other of his horſe ſhall die. But this is a falſe compact; becauſe no man has a right to barter his life, no more than to take it away, as it is not his own. And next the compact is inadequate, and would be ſet aſide even in a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience, ſince it is far better
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0657000202:117"/>
that two men ſhould live, than that one man ſhould ride. But a compact that is falſe between two men, is equally ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an hundred, or an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; for as ten millions of circles can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make a ſquare, ſo the united voice of myriads cannot lend the ſmalleſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to falſehood. It is thus that reaſon ſpeaks, and untutored nature ſays the ſame thing. Savages that are directed nearly by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other; they ſeldom ſhed blood but to retaliate former cruelty.</p>
            <p>Our Saxon anceſtors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace; and in all commencing govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that have the print of nature ſtill ſtrong upon them, ſcarce any crime is held capital.</p>
            <p>It is among the citizens of a reſined community that penal laws, which are in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0657000202:118"/>
the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, ſeems to acquire the moroſeneſs of age; and as if our poſſeſſions were become dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in proportion as they increaſed, as if the more enormous our wealth, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive our fears, our poſſeſſions are paled up with new edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to ſcare every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader.</p>
            <p>Whether is it from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiouſneſs of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that this country ſhould ſhew more convicts in a year, than half the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Europe united? Perhaps it is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to both; for they mutually produce each other. When by indiſcriminate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal laws a nation beholds the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment affixed to diſſimilar degrees of guilt, from perceiving no diſtinction in the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the people are led to loſe all ſenſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in the crime, and this diſtinction is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0657000202:119"/>
the bulwark of all morality: thus the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of laws produce new vices, and new vices call for freſh reſtraints.</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed then that power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of contriving new laws to puniſh vice, inſtead of drawing hard the cords of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety till a convulſion come to burſt them, inſtead of cutting away wretches as uſeleſs, before we have tried their utility, inſtead of converting correction into vengeance, it were to be wiſhed that we tried the reſtrictive arts of government, and made law the protector, but not the tyrant of the people. We ſhould then find that creatures, whoſe ſouls are held as droſs, only wanted the hand of a refiner; we ſhould then find that wretches, now ſtuck up for long tortures, leſt luxury ſhould feel a momentary pang, might, if properly treated, ſerve to ſinew the ſtate in times of danger; that, as their faces are like ours, their hearts are ſo too; that few minds are ſo baſe as that perſeverance
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0657000202:120"/>
cannot amend; that a man may ſee his laſt crime without dying for it; and that very little blood will ſerve to cement our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

               <p>Happineſs and miſery rather the reſult of prudence than of virtue in this life. Temporal evils or felicities being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by heaven as things merely in themſelves trifling and unworthy its care in the diſtribution.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Had now been confined more than a fortnight, but had not ſince my arrival been viſited by my dear Olivia, and I greatly longed to ſee her. Having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated my wiſhes to my wife, the next morning the poor girl entered my apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leaning on her ſiſter's arm. The change which I ſaw in her countenance ſtruck me. The numberleſs graces that once reſided there were now fled, and the hand
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0657000202:122"/>
of death ſeemed to have molded every fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to alarm me. Her temples were ſunk, her forehead was tenſe, and a fatal paleneſs ſate upon her cheek.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am glad to ſee thee, my dear,"</q> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"but why this dejection Livy? I hope, my love, you have too great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for me, to permit diſappointment thus to undermine a life which I prize as my own. Be chearful child, and we may yet ſee happier days."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You have ever, ſir,"</q> replied ſhe, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"been kind to me, and it adds to my pain that I ſhall never have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſharing that happineſs you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Happineſs, I fear, is no longer reſerved for me here; and I long to be rid of a place where I have only found diſtreſs. Indeed, ſir, I wiſh you would make a proper ſubmiſſion to Mr. Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0657000202:123"/>
it may, in ſome meaſure, induce him to pity you, and it will give me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in dying."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Never, child,"</q> replied I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I never ſhall be brought to acknowledge my daughter a proſtitute; for tho' the world may look upon your offence with ſcorn, let it be mine to regard it as a mark of credulity, not of guilt. My dear, I am no way mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in this place, however diſmal it may ſeem, and be aſſured that while you continue to bleſs me by living, he ſhall never have my conſent to make you more wretched by marrying another."</q>
            </p>
            <p>After the departure of my daughter, my fellow priſoner, who was by at this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, ſenſibly enough expoſtulated upon my obſtinacy, in refuſing a ſubmiſſion, which promiſed to give me freedom. He obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the reſt of my family was not to be ſacrificed to the peace of one child
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0657000202:124"/>
alone, and ſhe the only one who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended me. <q rend="inline">"Beſide,"</q> added he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I don't know if it be juſt thus to obſtruct the union of man and wife, which you do at preſent, by refuſing to conſent to a match which you cannot hinder, but may render unhappy."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> replied I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"you are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the man that oppreſſes us. I am very ſenſible that no ſubmiſſion I can make could procure me liberty even for an hour. I am told that even in this very room a debtor of his, no later than laſt year, died for want. But though my ſubmiſſion and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation could transfer me from hence, to the moſt beautiful apartment he is poſſeſſed of; yet I would grant neither, as ſomething whiſpers me that it would be giving a ſanction to adultery. While my daughter lives, no other marriage of his ſhall ever be legal in my eye. Were
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0657000202:125"/>
ſhe removed, indeed, I ſhould be the baſeſt of men, from any reſentment of my own, to attempt putting aſunder thoſe who wiſh for an union. No, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain as he is, I could then wiſh him married, to prevent the conſequences of his future debaucheries. But ſhould I not now be the moſt cruel of all fathers, to ſign an Inſtrument which muſt ſend my child to the grave, merely to avoid a priſon myſelf; and thus to eſcape one pang, break my child's heart with a thouſand?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>He acquieſced in the juſtice of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but could not avoid obſerving, that he feared my daughter's life was already too much waſted to keep me long a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"However, continued he, though you refuſe to ſubmit to the nephew, I hope you have no objections to laying your caſe before the uncle, who has the firſt character in the kingdom for every thing that is juſt and good. I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0657000202:126"/>
would adviſe you to ſend him a letter by the poſt, intimating all his nephew's ill uſage, and my life for it that in three days you ſhall have an anſwer."</q> I thank'd him for the hint, and inſtantly fet about complying; but I wanted paper, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily all our money had been laid out that morning in proviſions, however he ſupplied me.</p>
            <p>For the three enſuing days I was in a ſtate of anxiety, to know what reception my letter might meet with; but in the mean time was frequently ſolicited by my wife to ſubmit to any conditions rather than remain here, and every hour received repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted accounts of the decline of my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's health. The third day and the fourth arrived, but I received no anſwer to my letter: the complaints of a ſtranger againſt a favourite nephew, were no way likely to ſucceed; ſo that theſe hopes ſoon vaniſhed like all my former. My mind,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0657000202:127"/>
however, ſtill ſupported itſelf though confinement and bad air began to make a viſible alteration in my health, and my arm that had ſuffered in the fire, grew worſe. But my children ſtill ſate by me, and while I was ſtretched on my ſtraw, read to me by turns, or liſtened and wept at my inſtructions. But my daughter's health declined faſter than mine; every meſſage from her contributed to encreaſe my apprehenſions and pain. The fifth morning after I had written the letter which was ſent to ſir William Thornhill, I was alarmed with an account that ſhe was ſpeechleſs. Now it was, that confinement was truly painful to me; my ſoul was burſting from its priſon to be near the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of my child, to comfort, to ſtrengthen her, to receive her laſt wiſhes, and teach her ſoul the way to heaven! Another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count came. She was expiring, and yet I was debarred the ſmall comfort of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0657000202:128"/>
by her. My fellow priſoner, ſome time after, came with the laſt account. He bade me be patient. She was dead!—The next morning he returned, and found me with my two little ones, now my only companions, who were uſing all their innocent efforts to comfort me. They entreated to read to me, and bid me not to cry, for I was now too old to weep. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And is not my ſiſter an angel, now, pappa,"</q> cried the eldeſt, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"and why then are you ſorry for her? I wiſh I were an angel out of this frightful place, if my pappa were with me"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Yes,"</q> added my youngeſt darling, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Heaven, where my ſiſter is, is a finer place than this, and there are none but good people there, and the people here are very bad."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Jenkinſon interupted their harmleſs prattle, by obſerving that now my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was no more, I ſhould ſeriouſly think of the reſt of my family, and attempt to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0657000202:129"/>
ſave my own life, which was every day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, for want of neceſſaries and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome air. He added, that it was now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on me to ſacrifice any pride or reſentment of my own, to the welfare of thoſe who depended on me for ſupport; and that I was now, both by reaſon and juſtice, obliged to try to reconcile my land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Heaven be praiſed,"</q> replied I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"there is no pride left me now, I ſhould deteſt my own heart if I ſaw either pride or reſentment lurking there. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as my oppreſſor has been once my pariſhioner, I hope one day to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him up an unpolluted ſoul at the eternal tribunal. No, ſir, I have no reſentment now, and though he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from me what I held dearer than all his treaſures, though he has wrung my heart, for I am ſick almoſt to fainting, very ſick, my fellow priſoner, yet that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0657000202:130"/>
ſhall never inſpire me with vengeance. I am now willing to approve his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and if this ſubmiſſion can do him any pleaſure, let him know, that if I have done him any injury, I am ſorry for it."</q> Mr. Jenkinſon took pen and ink, and wrote down my ſubmiſſion nearly as I have expreſt it, to which I ſigned my name, My ſon was employed to carry the letter to Mr. Thornhill, who was then at his ſeat in the country. He went, and in about ſix hours returned with a verbal anſwer. He had ſome difficulty, he ſaid, to get a ſight of his landlord, as the ſervants were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and ſuſpicious; but he accidentally ſaw him as he was going out upon buſineſs, preparing for his marriage, which was to be in three days. He continued to inform us, that he ſtept up in the humbleſt manner, and delivered the letter, which, when Mr. Thornhill had read, he ſaid that all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was now too late and unneceſſary; that he had heard of our application to his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0657000202:131"/>
uncle, which met with the contempt it deſerved; and as for the reſt, that all future applications ſhould be directed to his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, not to him. He obſerved, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that as he had a very good opinion of the diſcretion of the two young ladies, they might have been the moſt agreeable interceſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Well, ſir,"</q> ſaid I to my fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"you now diſcover the temper of the man that oppreſſes me. He can at once be facetious and cruel; but let him uſe me as he will, I ſhall ſoon be free, in ſpite of all his bolts to reſtrain me. I am now drawing towards an abode that looks brighter as I approach it: this expectation cheers my afflictions, and though I ſhall leave an helpleſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of orphans behind me, yet they will not be utterly forſaken; ſome friend, perhaps, will be found to aſſiſt them for the ſake of their poor father, and ſome
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0657000202:132"/>
may charitably relieve them for the ſake of their heavenly father."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Juſt as I ſpoke, my wife, whom I had not ſeen that day before, appeared with looks of terror, and making efforts, but unable to ſpeak. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Why, my love,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"why will you thus encreaſe my afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by your own, what though no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions can turn our ſevere maſter, tho' he has doomed me to die in this place of wretchedneſs, and though we have loſt a darling child, yet ſtill you will find comfort in your other children when I ſhall be no more."</q> 
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"We have indeed loſt,"</q> returned ſhe, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"a darling child. My Sophia, my deareſt, is gone, ſnatched from us, carried off by ruffians!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0657000202:133"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"How, madam,"</q> cried my fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"miſs Sophia carried off by villains, ſure it cannot be?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>She could only anſwer with a fixed look and a flood of tears. But one of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's wives, who was preſent, and came in with her, gave us a more diſtinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: ſhe informed us that as my wife, my daughter, and herſelf, were taking a walk together on the great road a little way out of the village, a poſt - chaiſe and four drove up to them and inſtantly ſtopt. Upon which, a well dreſt man, but not Mr. Thornhill, ſtepping out, claſped my daughter round the waiſt, and forcing her in, bid the poſtillion drive on, ſo that they were out of ſight in a moment.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Now,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the ſum of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries is made up, nor is it in the power of any thing on earth to give me another pang. What! not one left! not to leave

Our diſtreſſes are great; but I could bear this and more, if I ſaw you but eaſy. They may take away my children and all the world, if they leave me but you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>My Son, who was preſent, endeavoured to moderate our grief; he bade us take comfort, for he hoped that we might ſtill have reaſon to be thankful.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"My child,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"look round the world, and ſee if there be any happineſs left me now.

            <argument>
               <p>The equal dealings of providence demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated with regard to the happy and the miſerable here below. That from the nature of pleaſure and pain, the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſt be repaid the balance of their ſufferings in the life hereafter.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MY friends, my children, and fellow ſufferers, when I reflect on the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been given man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, yet ſtill more to ſuffer. Though we ſhould examine the whole world, we ſhall not find one man ſo happy as to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to wiſh for; but we daily ſee thouſands who by ſuicide ſhew us they
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0657000202:147"/>
have nothing left to hope. In this life then it appears that we cannot be entirely bleſt; but yet we may be completely miſerable!</p>
            <p>Why man ſhould thus feel pain, why our wretchedneſs ſhould be requiſite in the formation of univerſal felicity, why, when all other ſyſtems are made perfect only by the perfection of their ſubordinate parts, the great ſyſtem ſhould require for its perfection, parts that are not only ſubordinate to others, but imperfect in themſelves? Theſe are queſtions that never can be explained, and might be uſeleſs if known. On this ſubject providence has thought fit to elude our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, ſatisfied with granting us motives to conſolation.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation, man has called in the friendly aſſiſtance of philoſophy, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeeing the incapacity of that to conſole him, has given him the aid of religion.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0657000202:148"/>
The conſolations of philoſophy are very amuſing, but often fallacious. It tells us that life is filled with comforts, if we will but enjoy them; and on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries here, life is ſhort, and they will ſoon be over. Thus do theſe conſolations deſtroy each other; for if life is a place of comfort, its ſhortneſs muſt be miſery, and if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philoſophy is weak; but religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comforts in an higher ſtrain. Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and preparing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making himſelf a heaven of happineſs here, while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices, ſhrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0657000202:149"/>
heaven. To religion then we muſt hold in every circumſtance of life for our trueſt comfort; for if already we are happy, it is a pleaſure to think that we can make that happineſs unending, and if we are miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it is very conſoling to think that there is a place of reſt. Thus to the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate religion holds out a continuance of bliſs, to the wretched a change from pain.</p>
            <p>But though religion is very kind to all men, it has promiſed peculiar reward to the unhappy; the ſick, the naked, the houſeleſs, the heavy-laden, and the priſoner, have ever moſt frequent promiſes in our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred law. The author of our religion every where profeſſes himſelf the wretch's friend, and unlike the falſe ones of this world, beſtows all his careſſes upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn. The unthinking have cenſured this as partiality, as a preference with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0657000202:150"/>
merit to deſerve it. But they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that it is not in the power even of heaven itſelf to make the offer of unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miſerable. To the firſt eternity is but a ſingle bleſſing, ſince at moſt it but encreaſes what they already poſſeſs. To the latter it is a double advantage; for it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes their pain here, and rewards them with heavenly bliſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>But providence is in another reſpect kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the poor than the rich; for as it thus makes the life after death more deſirable, ſo it ſmooths the paſſage there. The wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man of ſorrows lays himſelf quietly down, he has no poſſeſſions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and but few ties to ſtop his departure: he feels only nature's pang in the final ſeparation, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before; for after a certain degree of pain, every
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0657000202:151"/>
new breach that death opens in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, nature kindly covers with inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
            <p>Thus providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life, greater felicity in dying, and in heaven all that ſuperiority of pleaſure which ariſes from contraſted enjoyment. And this ſuperiority, my friends, is no ſmall advantage, and ſeems to be one of the pleaſures of the poor man in the parable; for though he was already in heaven, and felt all the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happineſs, that he had once been wretched and now was comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he had known what it was to be miſerable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</p>
            <p>Thus, my friends, you ſee religion does what philſophy could never do: it ſhews the equal dealings of heaven to the happy
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0657000202:152"/>
and the unhappy, and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the ſame ſtandard. It gives to both rich and poor the ſame happineſs hereafter, and equal hopes to aſpire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleaſure here, the poor have the endleſs ſatisfaction of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it was once to be miſerable, when crowned with endleſs felicity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; and even though this ſhould be called a ſmall advantage, yet being an eternal one, it muſt make up by duration what the temporal happineſs of the great may have exceeded by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeneſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe are therefore the conſolations which the wretched have peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in which they are above the reſt of mankind; in other reſpects they are below them. They who would know the miſeries of the poor muſt ſee life and endure it.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0657000202:153"/>
To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe or practiſe. The men who have the neceſſaries of living are not poor, and they who want them muſt be miſerable. Yes, my friends, we muſt be miſerable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can ſooth the wants of nature, can give elaſtic ſweetneſs to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or eaſe to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the philoſopher from his couch of ſoftneſs tell us that we can reſiſt all theſe. Alas! the effort by which we reſiſt them is ſtill the greateſt pain! Death is ſlight, and any man may ſuſtain it; but torments are dreadful, and theſe no man can endure.</p>
            <p>To us then, my friends, the promiſes of happineſs in heaven ſhould be peculiarly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are then indeed of all men the moſt miſerable.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0657000202:154"/>
When I look round theſe gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us; this light that only ſerves to ſhew the horrors of the place, thoſe ſhackles that tyranny has impoſed, or crime made neceſſary; when I ſurvey theſe emaciated looks, and hear thoſe groans, O my friends, what a glorious exchange would heaven be for theſe. To fly through regions unconfined as air, to baſk in the ſunſhine of eternal bliſs, to carrol over endleſs hymns of praiſe, to have no maſter to threaten or inſult us, but the form of goodneſs himſelf for ever in our eyes, when I think of theſe things, death becomes the meſſenger of very glad tidings; when I think of theſe things, his ſharpeſt arrow becomes the ſtaff of my ſupport; when I think of theſe things, what is there in life worth having; when I think of theſe things, what is there that ſhould not be ſpurned away: kings in their palaces ſhould groan for ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0657000202:155"/>
but we, humbled as we are, ſhould yearn for them.</p>
            <p>And ſhall theſe things be ours? Ours they will certainly be if we but try for them; and what is a comfort, we are ſhut out from many temptations that would retard our purſuit. Only let us try for them, and they will certainly be ours, and what is ſtill a comfort, ſhortly too; for if we look back on paſt life, it appears but a very ſhort ſpan, and whatever we may think of the reſt of life, it will yet be found of leſs duration; as we grow ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the days ſeem to grow ſhorter, and our intimacy with time, ever leſſens the perception of his ſtay. Then let us take comfort now, for we ſhall ſoon be at our journey's end; we ſhall ſoon lay down the heavy burthen laid by heaven upon us, and though death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view, and like his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0657000202:156"/>
horizon, ſtill flies before him; yet the time will certainly and ſhortly come, when we ſhall ceaſe from our toil; when the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious great ones of the world ſhall no more tread us to the earth; when we ſhall think with pleaſure on our ſufferings below; when we ſhall be ſurrounded with all our friends, or ſuch as deſerved our friendſhip; when our bliſs ſhall be unutterable, and ſtill, to crown all, unending.</p>

            <p>WHEN I had thus finiſhed and my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was retired, the gaoler, who was one of the moſt humane of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, hoped I would not be diſpleaſed, as what he did was but his duty, obſerving that he muſt be obliged to remove my ſon into a ſtronger cell, but that he ſhould be permitted to reviſit me every morning. I thanked him for his clemency, and graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my boy's hand, bade him farewell, and be mindful of the great duty that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0657000202:158"/>
I again, therefore laid me down, and one of my little ones ſate by my bedſide read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when Mr. Jenkinſon entering, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me that there was news of my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for that ſhe was ſeen by a perſon about two hours before in a ſtrange gentleman's company, and that they had ſtopt at a neighbouring village for refreſhment, and ſeemed as if returning to town. He had ſcarce delivered this news, when the gaoler came with looks of haſte and pleaſure, to inform me, that my daughter was found. Moſes came running in a moment after, crying out that his ſiſter Sophy was below and coming up with our old friend Mr. Burchell.</p>
            <p>Juſt as he delivered this news my deareſt girl entered, and with looks almoſt wild with pleaſure, ran to kiſs me in a tranſport of affection. Her mother's tears and ſilence alſo ſhewed her pleaſure.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Here, pappa,"</q>

            <p>

I met ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral on the road, to whom I cried out for aſſiſtance; but they diſregarded my entreaties. In the mean time the ruffian himſelf uſed every art to hinder me from crying out: he flattered and threatened
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0657000202:161"/>
by turns, and ſwore that if I continued but ſilent, he intended no harm. In the mean time I had broken the canvas that he had drawn up, and whom ſhould I perceive at ſome diſtance but your old friend Mr. Burchell, walking along with his uſual ſwiftneſs, with the great ſtick for which we uſed ſo much to ridicule him. As ſoon as we came within hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I called out to him by name, and entreated his help. I repeated my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations ſeveral times, upon which, with a very loud voice, he bid the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillion ſtop; but the boy took no notice, but drove on with ſtill greater ſpeed. I now thought he could never overtake us, when in leſs than a minute I ſaw Mr. Burchell come running up by the ſide of the horſes, and with one blow knock the poſtillion to the ground.

The poſtillion, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, was going to make his eſcape too; but Mr. Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again, and drive back to town. Finding it impoſſible to reſiſt, he reluctantly complied, though the wound he had received ſeemed, to me at leaſt, to be dangerous. He continued to complain of the pain as we drove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, ſo that he at laſt excited Mr. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell's compaſſion, who, at my requeſt, exchanged him for another at an inn where we called on our return."</q>

welcomes. Though our chear is but wretched, yet our hearts are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you. And now, Mr. Burchell, as you have delivered my girl, if you think her a recompence ſhe is yours, if you can ſtoop to an alliance with a family ſo poor as mine, take her, obtain her conſent, as I know you have her heart, and you have mine. And let me tell you, Sir, that I give you no ſmall treaſure, ſhe has been celebrated for beauty it is true, but that is not my meaning, I give you up a treaſure in her mind."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"But I ſuppoſe, Sir,"</q> cried Mr. Burchell, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that you are apprized of my circumſtances, and of my incapacity to ſupport her as ſhe deſerves?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If your preſent objection,"</q> replied I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"be meant as an evaſion of my offer, I deſiſt: but I know no man ſo worthy to deſerve her as you; and if I could give

her thouſands, and thouſands ſought her from me, yet my honeſt brave Burchell ſhould be my deareſt choice."</q>
            </p>
            <p>To all this his ſilence alone ſeemed to give a mortifying refuſal, and without the leaſt reply to my offer, he demanded if we could not be furniſhed with refreſhments from the next inn, to which being anſwered in the affirmative, he ordered them to ſend in the beſt dinner that could be provided upon ſuch ſhort notice. He beſpoke alſo a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of their beſt wine; and ſome cordials for me. Adding, with a ſmile, that he would ſtretch a little for once, and tho' in a priſon, aſſerted he was never better diſpoſed to be merry. The waiter ſoon made his appearance with preparations for dinner, a table was lent us by the gaoler, who ſeemed remarkably aſſiduous, the wine was diſpoſed in order, and two very well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt diſhes were brought in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0657000202:165"/>
My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother's melancholy ſituation, and we all ſeemed unwilling to damp her chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the relation. But it was in vain that I attempted to appear chearful, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of my unfortunate ſon broke through all efforts to diſſemble; ſo that I I was at laſt obliged to damp our mirth by relating his misfortunes, and wiſhing that he might be permitted to ſhare with us in this little interval of ſatisfaction. After my gueſts were recovered from the conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion my account had produced, I requeſted alſo that Mr. Jenkinſon, a fellow priſoner, might be admitted, and the gaoler granted my requeſt with an air of unuſual ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The clanking of my ſon's irons was no ſooner heard along the paſſage, than his ſiſter ran impatiently to meet him; while Mr. Burchell, in the mean time, aſked me if my ſon's name were George, to which replying in the affirmative, he ſtill continued ſilent. As ſoon as my boy entered the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0657000202:166"/>
room, I could perceive he regarded Mr. Burchell with a look of aſtoniſhment and reverence. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Come on,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"my ſon, though we are fallen very low, yet providence has been pleaſed to grant us ſome ſmall relaxation from pain. Thy ſiſter is reſtored to us, and there is her deliverer: to that brave man it is that I am indebted for yet having a daughter, give him, my boy, the hand of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he deſerves our warmeſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude."</q>
            </p>
            <p>My ſon ſeemed all this while regardleſs of what I ſaid, and ſtill continued fixed at reſpectful diſtance.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"My dear brother,"</q> cried his ſiſter, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"why don't you thank my good deliverer; the brave ſhould ever love each other."</q>
            </p>
            <p>He ſtill continued his ſilence and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, till our gueſt at laſt perceived himſelf to be known, and aſſuming all his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0657000202:167"/>
native dignity, deſired my ſon to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Never before had I ſeen any thing ſo truly majeſtic as the air he aſſumed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion. The greateſt object in the univerſe, ſays a certain philoſopher, is a good man ſtruggling with adverſity; yet there is ſtill a greater, which is the good man that comes to relieve it. After he had regarded my ſon for ſome time with a ſuperior air, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I again find,'</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"unthinking boy, that the ſame crime"</q> But here he was interrupted by one of the gaoler's ſervants, who came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us that a perſon of diſtinction, who had driven into town with a chariot and ſeveral attendants, ſent his reſpects to the gentleman that was with us, and begged to know when he ſhould think proper to be waited upon.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Bid the fellow wait,"</q> cried our gueſt, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"till I ſhall have leiſure to receive him;"</q> and then turning to my ſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I again find, Sir,"</q> proceeded he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that you are guilty of the ſame offence
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0657000202:168"/>
for which you once had my reproof, and for which the law is now preparing its juſteſt puniſhments. You imagine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that a contempt for your own life, gives you a right to take that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but where, Sir, is the difference between a dueliſt who hazards a life of no value, and the murderer who acts with greater ſecurity? Is it any dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the gameſter's fraud when he alledges that he has ſtaked a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Alas, Sir,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"whoever you are, pity the poor miſguided creature; for what he has done was in obedience to a deluded mother, who in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her reſentment required him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her bleſſing to avenge her quarrel. Here, Sir, is the letter, which will ſerve to convince you of her imprudence and diminiſh his guilt."</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0657000202:169"/>
He took the letter, and haſtily read it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <q rend="inline">"This,"</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"though not a perfect excuſe, is ſuch a palliation of his fault, as induces me to forgive him. And now, Sir,"</q> continued he, kindly taking my ſon by the hand, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I ſee you are ſurpriſed at finding me here; but I have often viſited priſons upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions leſs intereſting. I am now come to ſee juſtice done a worthy man, for whom I have the moſt ſincere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem. I have long been a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed ſpectator of thy father's bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. I have at his little dwelling enjoyed reſpect uncontaminated by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and have received that happineſs that courts could not give, from the amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſimplicity round his fire-ſide. My nephew has been apprized of my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of coming here, and I find is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; it would be wronging him and you to condemn him without examination: if
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0657000202:170"/>
there be injury, there ſhall be redreſs; and this I may ſay without boaſting, that none have ever taxed the injuſtice of Sir William Thornhill."</q>
            </p>
            <p>We now found the perſonage whom we had ſo long entertained as an harmleſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſing companion was no other than the celebrated Sir William Thornhill, to whoſe virtues and ſingularities ſcarce any were ſtrangers. The poor Mr. Burchell was in reality a man of large fortune and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to whom ſenates liſtened with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and whom party heard with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; who was the friend of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but loyal to his king. My poor wife recollecting her former familiarity, ſeemed to ſhrink with apprehenſion; but Sophia, who a few moments before thought him her own, now perceiving the immenſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to which he was removed by fortune, was unable to conceal her tears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0657000202:171"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Sir,"</q> cried my wife, with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous aſpect, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"how is it poſſible that I can ever have your forgiveneſs; the ſlights you received from me the laſt time I had the honour of ſeeing you at our houſe, and the jokes which I audaciouſly threw out, theſe jokes, Sir, I fear can never be forgiven."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"My dear good lady,"</q> returned he with a ſmile, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"if you had your joke, I had my anſwer: I'll leave it to all the company if mine were not as good as yours. To ſay the truth, I know no body whom I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be angry with at preſent but the fellow who ſo frighted my little girl here. I had not even time to examine the raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal's perſon ſo as to deſcribe him in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement. Can you tell me, Sophia, my dear, whether you ſhould know him again?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, Sir,"</q> replied ſhe, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I can't be poſitive; yet now I recollect he had

a large mark over one of his eye-brows."</q> 
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I aſk pardon, madam,"</q> interrupted Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon, who was by, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"but be ſo good as to inform me if the fellow wore his own red hair?"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Yes, I think ſo,"</q> cried Sophia.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"And did your honour,"</q> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, turning to Sir William, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"obſerve the length of his legs?"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I can't be ſure of their length,"</q> cried the Baronet, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"but I am convinced of their ſwiftneſs; for he out-ran me, which is what I thought few men in the kingdom could have done."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Pleaſe your honour,"</q> cried Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I know the man: it is certainly the ſame; the beſt runner in England; he has beaten Pinwire of Newcaſtle, Timothy Baxter is his name, I know him perfectly, and the very place of his retreat this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If your honour will bid Mr. Gaoler let two of his men go with me, I'll engage to produce him to you in an hour at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt."</q> Upon this the gaoler was called, who inſtantly appearing, Sir William de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0657000202:173"/>
if he knew him. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Yes, pleaſe your honour,"</q> reply'd the gaoler, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I know Sir William Thornhill well, and every body that knows any thing of him, will deſire to know more of him."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Well then,"</q> ſaid the Baronet, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"my requeſt is, that you will permit this man and two of your ſervants to go upon a meſſage by my authority, and as I am in the commiſſion of the peace, I undertake to ſecure you."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Your promiſe is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,"</q> replied the other, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"and you may at a minute's warning ſend them over England whenever your honour thinks fit."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuance of the gaoler's compliance, Jenkinſon was diſpatched in ſearch of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy Baxter, while we were amuſed with the aſſiduity of our youngeſt boy Bill, who had juſt come in and climbed up to Sir William's neck in order to kiſs him. His mother was immediately going to chaſtiſe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0657000202:174"/>
his familiarity, but the worthy man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her; and taking the child, all rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as he was, upon his knee, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What, Bill, you chubby rogue,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"do you remember your old friend Burchell; and Dick too, my honeſt veteran, are you here, you ſhall find I have not forgot you."</q> So ſaying, he gave each a large piece of gingerbread, which the poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows eat very heartily, as they had got that morning but a very ſcanty breakfaſt.</p>
            <p>We now ſate down to dinner, which was almoſt cold; but previouſly, my arm ſtill continuing painful, Sir William wrote a preſcription, for he had made the ſtudy of phyſic his amuſement, and was more than moderately ſkilled in the profeſſion: this being ſent to an apothecary who lived in the place, my arm was dreſſed, and I found almoſt inſtantaneous relief. We were waited upon at dinner by the gaoler himſelf, who was willing to do our gueſt all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

in his power. But before we had well dined, another meſſage was brought from his nephew, deſiring permiſſion to appear, in order to vindicate his innocence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with which requeſt the Baronet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and deſired Mr. Thornhill to be introduced.</p>

            <p>MR.

How is it, Sir, that this poor man, for whom I know you profeſſed a friendſhip, is uſed thus hardly? His daughter vilely ſeduced, as a recompence
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0657000202:177"/>
for his hoſpitality, and he himſelf thrown into a priſon perhaps but for reſenting the inſult? His ſon too, whom you feared to face as a man—"</q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Is it poſſible, Sir,"</q> interrupted his nephew, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that my uncle could object that as a crime which his repeated inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alone have perſuaded me to avoid."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Your rebuke,"</q> cried Sir William <q rend="inline margQuotes">"is juſt; you have acted in this inſtance pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and well, though not quite as your father would have done: my brother indeed was the ſoul of honour; but thou—yes you have acted in this inſtance perfectly right, and it has my warmeſt approbation."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And I hope,"</q> ſaid his nephew, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that the reſt of my conduct will not be found to deſerve cenſure. I appeared, Sir, with this gentleman's daughter at ſome places
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0657000202:178"/>
of public amuſement; thus what was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, ſcandal called by a harſher name, and it was reported that I had debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. I waited on her father in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, willing to clear the thing to his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and he received me only with inſult and abuſe. As for the reſt, with regard to his being here, my attorney and ſteward can beſt inform you, as I commit the management of buſineſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to them. If he has contracted debts and is unwilling or even unable to pay them, it is their buſineſs to proceed in this manner, and I ſee no hardſhip or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in purſuing the moſt legal means of redreſs."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If this,"</q> cried Sir William, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"be as you have ſtated it, there is nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable in your offence, and though your conduct might have been more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous in not ſuffering this gentleman to be oppreſſed by ſubordinate tyranny, yet it has been at leaſt equitable."</q>

Thus, Sir,"</q> continued he, finding that I was ſilent, for in fact I could not contradict him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"thus, Sir, my own innocence is vindicated; but though at your entreaty I am ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give this gentleman every other offence, yet his attempts to leſſen me in your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, excite a reſentment that I cannot govern. And this too at a time when his ſon was actually preparing to take away my life; this, I ſay, was ſuch guilt, that I am determined to let the law take its courſe. I have here the challenge that was ſent me and two witneſſes to prove it; and even though my uncle himſelf ſhould diſſuade me, which I know he will not, yet I will ſee public juſtice done, and he ſhall ſuffer for it."</q>

but muſt my poor boy feel thy cruelty. I hope that good Sir William will protect us, for my ſon is as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as a child; I am ſure he is, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did harm to man."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Madam,"</q> replied the good man, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"your wiſhes for his ſafety are not greater than mine; but I am ſorry to find his guilt too plain; and if my nephew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts—"</q>But the appearance of Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon and the gaoler's two ſervants now called off our attention, who entered, haling in a tall man, very genteelly dreſt, and anſwering the deſcription al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given of the ruffian who had carried off my daughter—<q rend="inline">"Here,"</q> cried Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon, pulling him in, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"here we have him, and if ever there was a candidate for tyburn, this is one."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The moment Mr. Thornhill perceived the priſoner, and Jenkinſon, who had him
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0657000202:181"/>
in cuſtody, he ſeemed to ſhrink back with terror. His face became pale with conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous guilt, and he would have withdrawn; but Jenkinſon, who perceived his deſign, ſtopt him—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"What, 'Squire,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"are you aſhamed of your two old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, Jenkinſon and Baxter: but this is the way that all great men forget their friends, though I am reſolved we will not forget you. Our priſoner, pleaſe your honour,"</q> continued he, turning to Sir William, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"has already confeſſed all. He declares that it was Mr. Thornhill who firſt put him upon this affair, that he gave him the cloaths he now wears to appear like a gentleman, and furniſhed him with the poſt-chaiſe. The plan was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them that he ſhould carry off the young lady to a place of ſafety, and that there he ſhould threaten and terrify her; but Mr. Thornhill was to come in in the mean time, as if by accident, to her reſcue, and that they ſhould fight awhile
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0657000202:182"/>
and then he was to run off, by which Mr. Thornhill would have the better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of gaining her affections him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the character of her defender."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir William remembered the coat to have been frequently worn by his nephew, and all the reſt the priſoner himſelf confirmed by a more circumſtantial account; concluding, that Mr. Thornhill had often declared to him that he was in love with both ſiſters at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Heavens,"</q> cried Sir William, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"what a viper have I been foſtering in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom! And ſo fond of public juſtice too as he ſeemed to be. But he ſhall have it; ſecure him, Mr. Gaoler—yet hold, I fear there is not legal evidence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this, Mr. Thornhill, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt humility, entreated that two ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned wretches might not be admitted
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0657000202:183"/>
as evidences againſt him, but that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould be examined.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,"</q> replied Sir William, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"wretch, call them yours no longer: but come let us hear what thoſe fellows have to ſay, let his butler be called."</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the butler was introduced, he ſoon perceived by his former maſter's looks that all his power was now over. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Tell me,"</q> cried Sir William ſternly, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"have you ever ſeen your maſter and that fellow dreſt up in his cloaths in company together?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline margQuotes"> "Yes, pleaſe your honour,"</q> cried the butler, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"a thouſand times: he was the man that always brought him his ladies."</q>—<q rend="inline">"How,"</q> interrupted young Mr. Thornhill, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"this to my face!"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Yes,"</q> replied the butler, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"or to any man's face. To tell you a truth, Maſter Thornhill, I never either loved you or liked you, and I don't care if I tell you now a piece of my mind."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Now then,"</q> cried Jenkinſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"tell his

The night that gentleman's daughter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to our houſe, you were one of them."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"So then,"</q> cried Sir William, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I find you have brought a very fine wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to prove your innocence: thou ſtain to humanity! to aſſociate with ſuch wretches!"</q> (But continuing his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You tell me, Mr. Butler, that this was the perſon who brought him this old gentleman's daughter."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"No, pleaſe your honour,"</q> replied the butler, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"he did not bring her, for the 'Squire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf undertook that buſineſs; but he brought the prieſt that pretended to marry them."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"It is but too true,"</q> cried Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I cannot deny it, that was the employment aſſigned me, and I confeſs it to my confuſion."</q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Good heavens!"</q> exclaimed the Baronet, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"how every new diſcovery of his villainy
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0657000202:185"/>
alarms me. All his guilt is now too plain, and I find his preſent proſecution was dictated by tyranny, cowardice and revenge; at my requeſt, Mr. Gaoler, ſet this young officer, now your priſoner, free, and truſt to me for the conſequences. I'll make it my buſineſs to ſet the affair in a proper light to my friend the magiſtrate who has committed him. But where is the unfortunate young lady herſelf: let her appear to confront this wretch, I long to know by what arts he has ſeduced her honour. Entreat her to come in. Where is ſhe?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Sir,"</q> ſaid I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that queſtion ſtings me to the heart: I was once indeed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in a daughter, but her miſeries—"</q>Another interruption here prevented me; for who ſhould make her appearance but Miſs Arabella Wilmot, who was next day to have been married to Mr. Thornhill. Nothing could equal her ſurprize at ſeeing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0657000202:186"/>
Sir William and his nephew here before her; for her arrival was quite accidental. It happened that ſhe and the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man her father were paſſing through the town, on their way to her aunt's, who had inſiſted that her nuptials with Mr. Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill ſhould be conſummated at her houſe; but ſtopping for refreſhment, they put up at an inn at the other end of the town. It was there from the window that the young lady happened to obſerve one of my little boys playing in the ſtreet, and inſtantly ſending a footman to bring the child to her, ſhe learnt from him ſome account of our misfortunes; but was ſtill kept igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of young Mr. Thornhill's being the cauſe. Though her father made ſeveral remonſtrances on the impropriety of going to a priſon to viſit us, yet they were ineffectual; ſhe deſired the child to conduct her, which he did, and it was thus ſhe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed us at a juncture ſo unexpected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0657000202:187"/>
Nor can I go on, without a reflection on thoſe accidental meetings, which, though they happen every day, ſeldom excite our ſurprize but upon ſome extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. To what a fortuitous concurrence do we not owe every pleaſure and convenience of our lives. How many ſeeming accidents muſt unite before we can be cloathed or fed. The peaſant muſt be diſpoſed to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the ſhower muſt fall, the wind fill the merchant's ſail, or numbers muſt want the uſual ſupply.</p>
            <p>We all continued ſilent for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, while my charming pupil, which was the name I generally gave this young lady, united in her looks compaſſion and aſtoniſhment, which gave new finiſhings to her beauty. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, my dear Mr. Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,"</q> cried ſhe to the 'Squire, who ſhe ſuppoſed was come here to ſuccour and not to oppreſs us. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I take it a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly that you ſhould come here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0657000202:188"/>
me, or never inform me of the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a family ſo dear to us both: you know I ſhould take as much pleaſure in contributing to the relief of my reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend old maſter here, whom I ſhall ever eſteem, as you can. But I find that, like your uncle, you take a pleaſure in doing good in ſecret."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"He find pleaſure in doing good!"</q> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sir William, interrupting her. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"No, my dear, his pleaſures are as baſe as he is. You ſee in him, madam, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete a villain as ever diſgraced humanity. A wretch, who after having deluded this poor man's daughter, after plotting againſt the innocence of her ſiſter, has thrown the father into priſon, and the eldeſt ſon into fetters, becauſe he had courage to face his betrayer. And give me leave, madam, now to congratulate you upon an eſcape from the embraces of ſuch a monſter."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0657000202:189"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"O goodneſs,"</q> cried the lovely girl, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"how have I been deceived! Mr. Thornhill informed me for certain that this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's eldeſt ſon, Captain Primroſe, was gone off to America with his new-married lady."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"My ſweeteſt miſs,"</q> cried my wife, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"he has told you nothing but falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. My ſon George never left the kingdom, nor never was married. Tho' you have forſaken him, he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways loved you too well to think of any body elſe; and I have heard him ſay he would die a batchellor for your ſake."</q> She then proceeded to expatiate upon the ſincerity of her ſon's paſſion, ſhe ſet his duel with Mr. Thornhill in a proper light, from thence ſhe made a rapid digreſſion to the 'Squire's debaucheries, his pretended marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and ended with a moſt inſulting pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his cowardice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0657000202:190"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Good heavens!"</q> cried Miſs Wilmot, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"how very near have, I been to the brink of ruin! But how great is my pleaſure to have eſcaped it! Ten thouſand falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods has this gentleman told me! He had at laſt art enough to perſuade me that my promiſe to the only man I eſteemed was no longer binding, ſince he had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful. By his falſehoods I was taught to deteſt one equally brave and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>But by this time my ſon was freed from the incumbrances of juſtice. Mr. Jenkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo, who had acted as his valet de chambre, had dreſſed up his hair, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with whatever was neceſſary to make a genteel appearance. He now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entered, handſomely dreſt in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimentals, and, without vanity, (for I am above it) he appeared as handſome a fellow as ever wore a military dreſs.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0657000202:191"/>
As he entered, he made Miſs Wilmot a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and diſtant bow, for he was not as yet acquainted with the change which the eloquence of his mother had wrought in his favour. But no decorums could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the impatience of his bluſhing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs to be forgiven. Her tears, her looks, all contributed to diſcover the real ſenſations of her heart for having forgotten her former promiſe and having ſuffered herſelf to be deluded by an impoſtor. My ſon appeared amazed at her condeſcenſion, and could ſcarce believe it real.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sure, madam,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"this is but deluſion! I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have merited this! To be bleſt thus is to be too happy."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir,"</q> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I have been deceived, baſely deceived, elſe nothing could have ever made me unjuſt to my promiſe. You know my friendſhip, you have long known it; but forget what I have done, and as you once had my warmeſt vows of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0657000202:192"/>
conſtancy, you ſhall now have them repeated; and be aſſured that if your Arabella cannot be yours, ſhe ſhall never be another's."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"And no other's you ſhall be,"</q> cried Sir William, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"if I have any influence with your father."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This hint was ſufficient for my ſon Moſes, who immediately flew to the inn where the old gentleman was, to inform him of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumſtance that had happened. But in the mean time the 'Squire perceiving that he was on every ſide undone, now finding that no hopes were left from flattery or diſſimulation, concluded that his wiſeſt way would be to turn and face his purſuers. Thus laying aſide all ſhame, he appeared the open hardy villain. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I find then,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that I am to expect no juſtice here; but I am reſolved it ſhall be done me. You ſhall know, Sir,"</q> turning to Sir William, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am no
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0657000202:193"/>
longer a poor dependant upon your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. I ſcorn them. Nothing can keep Miſs Wilmot's fortune from me, which, I thank her father's aſſiduity, is pretty large. The articles, and a bond for her fortune, are ſigned, and ſafe in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. It was her fortune, not her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that induced me to wiſh for this match, and poſſeſſed of the one, let whoſe will take the other."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was an alarming blow, Sir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am was ſenſible of the juſtice of his claims, for he had been inſtrumental in drawing up the marriage articles himſelf. Miſs Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot therefore perceiving that her fortune was irretrievably loſt, turning to my ſon, ſhe aſked if the loſs of fortune could leſſen her value to him. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Though fortune,"</q> ſaid ſhe, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"is out of my power, at leaſt I have my hand to give."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0657000202:194"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And that, madam,"</q> cried her real lover, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"was indeed all that you ever had to give; at leaſt all that I ever thought worth the acceptance. And I now proteſt, my Arabella, by all that's happy, your want of fortune this moment encreaſes my pleaſure, as it ſerves to convince my ſweet girl of my ſincerity."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wilmot now entering, he ſeemed not a little pleaſed at the danger his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had juſt eſcaped, and readily conſented to a diſſolution of the match. But finding that her fortune, which was ſecured to Mr. Thornhill by bond, would not be given up, nothing could exceed his diſappointment. He now ſaw that his money muſt all go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own. He could bear his being a raſcal; but to want an equivalent to his daughter's fortune was wormwood. He ſate therefore for ſome minutes employed in the moſt mortifying ſpeculations, till Sir William attempted to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0657000202:195"/>
leſſen his anxiety.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I muſt confeſs, Sir,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that your preſent diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not entirely diſpleaſe me. Your immoderate paſſion for wealth is now juſtly puniſhed. But tho' the young lady cannot be rich, ſhe has ſtill a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petence ſufficient to give content. Here you ſee an honeſt young ſoldier, who is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take her without fortune; they have long loved each other, and for the friendſhip I bear his father, my intereſt ſhall not be wanting for his promotion. Leave then that ambition which diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points you, and for once admit hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs which courts your acceptance."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sir William,"</q> replied the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"be aſſured I never yet forced her inclinations, nor will I now. If ſhe ſtill continues to love this young gentleman, let her have him with all my heart. There is ſtill, thank heaven, ſome fortune left, and your promiſe will make it
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0657000202:196"/>
ſomething more. Only let my old friend here (meaning me) give me a promiſe of ſettling ſix thouſand pounds upon my girl, if ever he ſhould come to his fortune, and I am ready this night to be the firſt to join them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</q>
            </p>
            <p>As it now remained with me to make the young couple happy, I readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave a promiſe of making the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he required, which, to one who had ſuch little expectations as I, was no great favour. We had now therefore the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſeeing them fly into each other's arms in a tranſport. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"After all my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,"</q> cried my ſon George, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"to be thus rewarded! Sure this is more than I could ever have preſumed to hope for. To be poſſeſſed of all that's good, and after ſuch an interval of pain! My warmeſt wiſhes could never riſe ſo high!"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Yes, my George,"</q> returned his
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0657000202:197"/>
lovely bride, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"now let the wretch take my fortune; ſince you are happy without it ſo am I. O what an exchange have I made from the baſeſt of men to the deareſt beſt!—Let him enjoy our fortune, I now can be happy even in indigence."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"And I promiſe you,"</q> cried the 'Squire, with a malicious grin, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that I ſhall be very happy with what you deſpiſe."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Hold, hold, Sir,"</q> cried Jenkinſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"there are two words to that bargain. As for that lady's fortune, Sir, you ſhall never touch a ſingle ſtiver of it. Pray your honour,"</q> continued he to Sir William," <q rend="inline margQuotes">can the 'Squire have this lady's fortune if he be married to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"How can you make ſuch a ſimple demand,"</q> replied the Baronet, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"undoubtedly he cannot."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am ſorry for that,"</q> cried Jenkinſon; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"for as this gentleman and I have been old fellow ſporters, I have a friendſhip for him. But I muſt declare, well as I love him, that his contract is not worth a tobacco
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0657000202:198"/>
ſtopper, for he is married already."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"You lie, like a raſcal,"</q> returned the 'Squire, who ſeemed rouzed by this inſult, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I never was legally married to any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, begging your honour's pardon,"</q> replied the other, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"you were; and I hope you will ſhew a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of friendſhip to your own honeſt Jenkinſon, who brings you a wife, and if the company reſtrains their curioſity a few minutes, they ſhall ſee her."</q>—So ſaying he went off with his uſual celerity, and left us all unable to form any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conjecture as to his deſign.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Ay let him go,"</q> cried the 'Squire, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"whatever elſe I may have done I defy him there. I am too old now to be frightened with ſquibs."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am ſurpriſed,"</q> ſaid the Baronet, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"what the fellow can intend by this. Some low piece of humour I ſuppoſe!"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Perhaps, Sir,"</q> replied I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"he may have
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0657000202:199"/>
a more ſerious meaning. For when we reflect on the various ſchemes this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman laid to ſeduce innocence, perhaps ſome one more artful than the reſt has been found able to deceive him. When we conſider what numbers he has ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, how many parents now feel with anguiſh the infamy and the contamination which he has brought into their families, it would not ſurpriſe me if ſome one of them—Amazement! Do I ſee my loſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! Do I hold her! It is, it is my life, my happineſs. I thought thee loſt, my Olivia, yet ſtill I hold thee—and ſtill ſhalt thou live to bleſs me."</q>—The warmeſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the fondeſt lover were not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than mine when I ſaw him introduce my child, and held my daughter in my arms, whoſe ſilence only ſpoke her raptures. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And art thou returned to me, my dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"to be my comfort in age!"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That ſhe is,"</q> cried Jenkinſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"and make much of her, for ſhe is your

own honourable child, and as honeſt a woman as any in the whole room, let the other be who ſhe will. And as for you 'Squire, as ſure as you ſtand there this young lady is your lawful wedded wife. And to convince you that I ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth, here is the licence by which you were married together."</q>—So ſaying, he put the licence into the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet's hands, who read it, and found it perfect in every reſpect. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And now, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,"</q> continued he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I find you are ſurpriſed at all this; but a few words will explain the difficulty. That there 'Squire of renown, for whom I have a great friendſhip, but that's between ourſelves, has often employed me in doing odd lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle things for him. Among the reſt, he commiſſioned me to procure him a falſe licence and a falſe prieſt, in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this young lady. But as I was very much his friend, what did I do but went and got a true licence and a true prieſt,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0657000202:201"/>
and married them both as faſt as the cloth could make them. Perhaps you'll think it was generoſity that made me do all this. But no. To my ſhame I confeſs it, my only deſign was to keep the licence and let the 'Squire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper, and ſo make him come down whenever I wanted money."</q> A burſt of pleaſure now ſeemed to fill the whole apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; our joy reached even to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon room, where the priſoners themſelves ſympathized,<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And ſhook their chains</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>In tranſport and rude harmony.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Happineſs expanded upon every face, and even Olivia's cheek ſeemed fluſhed with pleaſure. To be thus reſtored to reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to friends and fortune at once, was a rapture ſufficient to ſtop the progreſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and reſtore former health and vivacity. But perhaps among all there was not one
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0657000202:202"/>
who felt ſincerer pleaſure than I. Still holding the dear-loved child in my arms, I aſked my heart if theſe tranſports were not deluſion. <q rend="inline margQuotes">How could you,"</q> cried I, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. Jenkinſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"how could you add to my miſeries by the ſtory of her death! But it matters not, my pleaſure at finding her again, is more than a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the pain."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As to your queſtion,"</q> replied Jenkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that is eaſily anſwered. I thought the only probable means of freeing you from priſon, was by ſubmitting to the 'Squire, and conſenting to his marriage with the other young lady. But theſe you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living, there was therefore no other method to bring things to bear but by perſuading you that ſhe was dead. I prevailed on your wiſe to join in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and we have not had a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of undeceiving you till now."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0657000202:203"/>
In the whole aſſembly now there only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared two faces that did not glow with tranſport. Mr. Thornhill's aſſurance had entirely forſaken him: he now ſaw the gulph of infamy and want before him, and trembled to take the plunge. He therefore fell on his knees before his uncle, and in a voice of piercing miſery implored compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Sir William was going to ſpurn him away, but at my requeſt he raiſed him, and after pauſing a few moments, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Thy vices, crimes, and ingratitude,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no tenderneſs; yet thou ſhalt not be entirely forſaken, a bare competence ſhall be ſupplied, to ſupport the wants of life, but not its follies. This young lady, thy wife, ſhall be put in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a third part of that fortune which once was thine, and from her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs alone thou art to expect any extraordinary ſupplies for the future."</q> He was going to expreſs his gratitude for ſuch kindneſs in a ſet ſpeech; but the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0657000202:204"/>
Baronet prevented him by bidding him not aggravate his meanneſs, which was already but too apparent. He ordered him at the ſame time to be gone, and from all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer domeſtics to chuſe one ſuch as he ſhould think proper, which was all that ſhould be granted to attend him.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he left us, Sir William very politely ſtept up to his new niece with a a ſmile, and wiſhed her joy. His example was followed by Miſs Wilmot and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; my wife too kiſſed her daughter with much affection, as, to uſe her own expreſſion, ſhe was now made an honeſt woman of. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia and Moſes followed in turn, and even our benefactor Jenkinſon deſired to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that honour. Our ſatisfaction ſeemed ſcarce capable of increaſe. Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, whoſe greateſt pleaſure was in doing good, now looked round with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance open as the ſun, and ſaw nothing but joy in the looks of all except that of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0657000202:205"/>
my daughter Sophia, who, for ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we could not comprehend, did not ſeem perfectly ſatisfied. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I think now,"</q> cried he, with a ſmile, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, except one or two, ſeem perfectly happy. There only remains an act of juſtice for me to do. You are ſenſible, Sir,"</q> continued he, turning to me, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"of the obligations we both owe Mr. Jenkinſon for his late aſſiduity in detecting a ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel. It is but juſt we ſhould both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him for it. Your youngeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Miſs Sophia, will, I am ſure, make him very happy, and he ſhall have from me five hundred pounds as her fortune, and upon this I am ſure they can live very comfortably together. Come, Miſs Sophia, what ſay you to this match of my making? Will you have him?"</q>—My poor girl ſeemed almoſt ſinking into her mother's arms at the hideous propoſal.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Have him, Sir!"</q> cried ſhe faintly. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir, never."</q>—<q rend="inline">What,"</q> cried he again,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0657000202:206"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"not have Mr. Jenkinſon, your benefactor, an handſome young fellow, with five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds and good expectations!"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I beg, Sir,"</q> returned ſhe, ſcarce able to ſpeak, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that you'll deſiſt, and not make me ſo very wretched."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Was ever ſuch obſtinacy known,"</q> cried he again, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"to refuſe a man whom the family has ſuch infinite obligations to, who has preſerved your ſiſter. What not have him!"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir, never,"</q> replied ſhe, angrily, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I'd ſooner die firſt."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"If that be the caſe then,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"if you will not have him—I think I muſt have you myſelf."</q> And ſo ſaying, he caught her to his breaſt with ardour. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"My love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt, my moſt ſenſible of girls,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"how could you ever think your own Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell could deceive you, or that Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Thornhill could ever ceaſe to admire a miſtreſs that loved him for himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? I have for ſome years ſought for a woman, who a ſtranger to my fortune
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0657000202:207"/>
could think that I had merit as a man. After having tried in vain, even amongſt the pert and the ugly, how great at laſt muſt be my rapture to have made a conqueſt over ſuch ſenſe and ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly beauty."</q> Then turning to Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As I cannot, Sir, part with this young lady myſelf, for ſhe has taken a fancy to the cut of my face, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence I can make is to give you her fortune, and you may call upon my ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to-morrow for five hundred pounds."</q> Thus we had all our compliments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, and Lady Thornhill underwent the ſame round of ceremony that her ſiſters had done before. In the mean time Sir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am's gentleman appeared to tell us that the equipages were ready to carry us to the inn, where every thing was prepared for our reception. My wife and I led the van, and left thoſe gloomy manſions of ſorrow. The generous Baronet ordered forty pounds to be diſtributed among the priſoners, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0657000202:208"/>
Mr. Wilmot, induced by his example, gave half that ſum. We were received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by the ſhouts of the villagers, and I ſaw and ſhook by the hand two or three of my honeſt pariſhioners, who were among the number. They attended us to our inn, where a ſumptuous entertainment was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and coarſer proviſions diſtributed in great quantities among the populace.</p>
            <p>After ſupper, as my ſpirits were exhauſted by the alternation of pleaſure and pain which they had ſuſtained during the day, I aſked permiſſion to withdraw, and leaving the company in the midſt of their mirth, as ſoon as I found myſelf alone, I poured out my heart in gratitude to the giver of joy as well as of ſorrow, and then ſlept undiſturbed till morning.</p>

               <p>The Concluſion.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE next morning as ſoon as I awaked I found my eldeſt ſon ſitting by my bedſide, who came to encreaſe my joy with another turn of fortune in my favour. Firſt having releaſed me from the ſettlement that I had made the day before in his favour, he let me know that my merchant who had failed in town was arreſted at Antwerp, and there had given up effects to a much greater amount than what was due to his creditors. My boy's generoſity pleaſed me almoſt as much as this unlooked for good fortune. But I had ſome doubts whether I
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0657000202:210"/>
ought in juſtice to accept his offer. While I was pondering upon this, Sir William en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room, to whom I communicated my doubts. His opinion was, that as my ſon was already poſſeſſed of a very affluent fortune by his marriage, I might accept his offer without any heſitation. His buſineſs, however, was to inform me that as he had the night before ſent for the licences, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them every hour, he hoped that I would not refuſe my aſſiſtance in making all the company happy that morning. A footman entered while we were ſpeaking, to tell us that the meſſenger was returned, and as I was by this time ready, I went down, where I found the whole company as merry as afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and innocence could make them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as they were now preparing for a very ſolemn ceremony, their laughter entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed me. I told them of the grave, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſublime deportment they ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon this myſtical occaſion, and read them two homilies and a theſis of my own
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0657000202:211"/>
compoſing, in order to prepare them. Yet they ſtill ſeemed perfectly refractory and ungovernable. Even as we were going along to church, to which I led the way, all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity had quite forſaken them, and I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tempted to turn back in indignation. In church a new dilemma aroſe, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed no eaſy ſolution. This was, which couple ſhould be married firſt; my ſon's bride warmly inſiſted, that Lady Thornhill, (that was to be) ſhould take the lead; but this the other refuſed with equal ardour, proteſting ſhe would not be guilty of ſuch rudeneſs for the world. The argument was ſupported for ſome time between both with equal obſtinacy and good breeding. But as I ſtood all this time with my book ready, I was at laſt quite tired of the conteſt, and ſhutting it, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I perceive,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that none of you have a mind to be married, and I think we had as good go back again; for I ſuppoſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0657000202:212"/>
there will be no buſineſs done here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day."</q>—This at once reduced them to reaſon. The Baronet and his Lady were firſt married, and then my ſon and his lovely partner.</p>
            <p>I had previouſly that morning given orders that a coach ſhould be ſent for my honeſt neighbour Flamborough and his family, by which means, upon our return to the inn, we had the pleaſure of finding the two Miſs Flamboroughs alighted before us. Mr. Jenkinſon gave his hand to the eldeſt, and my ſon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes led up the other; (and I have ſince found that he has taken a real liking to the girl, and my conſent and bounty he ſhall have whenever he thinks proper to demand them.) We were no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the inn, but numbers of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, hearing of my ſucceſs, came to congratulate me, but among the reſt were thoſe who roſe to reſcue me, and whom
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0657000202:213"/>
I formerly rebuked with ſuch ſharpneſs. I told the ſtory to Sir William, my ſon-in-law, who went out and reproved them with great ſeverity; but finding them quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened by his harſh reproof, he gave them half a guinea a piece to drink his health and raiſe their dejected ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Soon after this we were called to a very genteel entertainment, which was dreſt by Mr. Thornhill's cook. And it may not be improper to obſerve with reſpect to that gentleman, that he now reſides in quality of companion at a relation's houſe, being very well liked and ſeldom ſitting at the ſide-table, except when there is no room at the other; for they make no ſtranger of him. His time is pretty much taken up in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his relation, who is a little melancholy, in ſpirits, and in learning to blow the French-horn. My eldeſt daughter, however, ſtill remembers him with regret; and ſhe has
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0657000202:214"/>
even told me, though I make a great ſecret of it, that when he reforms ſhe may be brought to relent. But to return, for I am not apt to digreſs thus, when we were to ſit down to dinner our ceremonies were going to be renewed. The queſtion was whether my eldeſt daughter, as being a matron, ſhould not ſit above the two young brides, but the debate was cut ſhort by my ſon George, who propoſed, that the company ſhould ſit indiſcriminately, every gentleman by his lady, This was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with great approbation by all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting my wife, who I could perceive was not perfectly ſatisfied, as ſhe expected to have had the pleaſure of ſitting at the head of the table and carving all the meat for all the company. But notwithſtanding this, it is impoſſible to deſcribe our good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. I can't ſay whether we had more wit amongſt us now than uſual; but I am certain we had more laughing, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the end as well. One jeſt I parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0657000202:215"/>
remember, old Mr. Wilmot drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Moſes, whoſe head was turned ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, my ſon replied, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Madam, I thank you."</q> Upon which the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, winking upon the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, obſerved that he was thinking of his miſtreſs. At which jeſt I thought the two miſs Flamboroughs would have died with laughing. As ſoon as dinner was over, according to my old cuſtom, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that the table might be taken away, to have the pleaſure of ſeeing all my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily aſſembled once more by a chearful fire-ſide. My two little ones ſat upon each knee, the reſt of the company by their partners. I had nothing now on this ſide of the grave to wiſh for, all my cares were over, my pleaſure was unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It now only remained that my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in good fortune ſhould exceed my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſubmiſſion in adverſity.</p>
