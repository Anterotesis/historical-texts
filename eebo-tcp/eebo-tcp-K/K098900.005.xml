            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following Papers were publiſh'd, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of 'em written, by a Gentleman now Abroad. Many of 'em came from the ſame Hands which contributed to the other Volumes, ſeveral of which (I fancy) will eaſily diſtinguiſh themſelves to have been the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of a Gentleman lately dead; one who, to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a large Eſtate and good Education, had acquir'd Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and an exact Knowledge of the beſt Sort of Men both at
<pb facs="tcp:0397200205:3"/>
Home and Abroad; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, was Maſter of ſo much Wit and Humour, that there are few People whoſe Converſations could be more deſirable. His Friends and the Publick equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regret his Loſs, ſince he was ſerviceable and agreeable to 'em both in a very eminent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. The reſt of theſe Papers are to live upon what Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations they can give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and perhaps may be thought not altogether unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Honour of ſerving as a Supplement to the former Volumes.</p>

               <p>'TIS impoſſible perhaps for the beſt and wiſeſt amongſt us, to keep ſo conſtant a Guard upon our Temper, but that we may at one Time or other lie open to the Strokes of Fortune, and ſuch Incidents as we cannot foreſee. With Sentiments of this Kind I came Home to my Lodgings laſt Night, much fatigued with a long and ſudden Journey from the Country, and full of the ungrateful Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it. 'Twas natural for me to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Recourſe to my Pen and Ink; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would offer to make Uſe of them, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd deliberately to tell over a Hundred, and when I came to the End of that Sum, I found it more adviſable to defer drawing up my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Remonſtrance, till I had ſlept ſoundly on my Reſentments. Without any other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face

than this, I ſhall give the World a fair Account of the Treatment I have lately met with, and leave them to judge, whether the Uneaſineſs I have ſuffer'd be inconſiſtent with the Character I have generally pretended to. About Three Weeks ſince, I receiv'd an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a Kinſman in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> to ſpend my <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> in thoſe Parts. Upon taking Leave of Mr. <hi>Morphew,</hi> I put as many Papers into his Hands as would ſerve till my Return and charg'd him at parting, to be very punctual with the Town. In what Manner he and Mr. <hi>Lillie</hi> have been tamper'd with ſince, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, they have given me my Revenge, if I deſired any, by allowing their Names to an idle Paper, that in all humane Probability, cannot live a Fortnight to an End. My ſelf, and the Family I was with, were in the Midſt of Gaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a plentiful Entertainment, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Letter from my Siſter <hi>Jenny,</hi> who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioning ſome little Affairs I had intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to her, goes on thus: <q rend="inline">"The inclos'd, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, will give you ſome Surprize, as it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready aſtoniſh'd every Body here: Who Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> is, that ſubſcribes it, I don't know, any more than I can comprehend what could induce him to it. <hi>Morphew</hi> and <hi>Lillie,</hi> I am told, are both in the Secret.

                  </gap> In Purſuance of it, I was obliged upon this Notice to take Places in the Coach for my ſelf and my Maid with the utmoſt Expedition, leſt I ſhould, in a ſhort Time, be rallied out of my Exiſtence, as ſome People will needs fancy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0397200205:6"/>
Mr. <hi>Partridge</hi> has been, and the real <hi>Iſaac Bic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerſtaff</hi> have paſſed for a Creature of Mr. <hi>Steele</hi>'s Imagination. This Illuſion might have hoped for ſome tolerable Succeſs, if I had not more than once produced my Perſon in a crowded Theatre; and ſuch a Perſon as Mr. <hi>Steele,</hi> if I am not miſinformed in the Gentleman, would hardly think it an Advantage to own, though I ſhould throw him in all the little Honour I have gained by my <hi>Lucubrations.</hi> I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, perhaps, to underſtand Pleaſantry as well as other Men, and can (in the uſual Phraſe) take a Jeſt without being angry; but I appeal to the World, whether the Gentleman has not carried it too far, and whether he ought not to make a publick Recantation, if the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of ſome unthinking People ſhould force me to inſiſt upon it. The following Letter is juſt come to Hand, and I think it not improper to be inſerted in this Paper.</p>

But then, your Paper ceaſing immediately after; we were at a Loſs what to think: If you were weary of the Work you had ſo long carried on, and had given this Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> Orders to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify ſo to the Publick, he ſhould have ſaid it in plain Terms; but as that Paper is worded, one would be apt to judge, that he had a Mind to perſwade the Town that there was ſome Analogy between <hi>Iſaac Bickerſtaff</hi> and him-Poſſibly

Poſſibly there may be a Secret in this which I cannot enter into; but I flatter my ſelf that you never had any Thoughts of giving over your Labours for the Benefit of Mankind, when you cannot but know how many Subjects are yet unexhauſted, and how many others, as being leſs obvious, are wholly untouch'd. I dare promiſe, not only for my ſelf, but many other abler Friends, that we ſhall ſtill continue to furniſh you with Hints on all proper Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which is all your Genius requires. I think, by the Way, you cannot in Honour have any more to do with <hi>Morphew</hi> and <hi>Lillie,</hi> who have gone beyond the ordinary Pitch of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and tranſgreſs'd the very Letter of the Proverb, by endeavouring to cheat you of your Chriſtian and Sirname too.

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and, which was ſtill more pleaſant, with an Advertiſement at the End, calling me the <hi>Female</hi> TATLER: It is not enough to rob me of my Name, but now they muſt impoſe a Sex on me, when my Years have long ſince determin'd me to be of none at all. There is only one Thing wanting in the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they would renew my Age, and then I will heartily forgive them all the reſt. In the mean Time, whatever Uneaſineſs I have ſuffer'd from the little Malice of theſe Men, and my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement in the Country, the Pleaſures I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the ſame Occaſion, will fairly bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Account. On the one Hand I have been highly delighted to ſee my Name and Character aſſumed by the Scribblers of the Age, in order to recommend themſelves to it; and on the other, to obſerve the good Taſte of the Town, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing and exploding them through every Diſguiſe, and ſacrificing their Trifles to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>Manes</hi> of <hi>Iſaac Bickerſtaff</hi> Eſquire. But the greateſt Merit of my Journey into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> is, that it has open'd to me a new Fund of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd Follies and Errors that have hitherto lain out of my View, and, by their Situation, eſcap'd my Cenſure. For, as I have liv'd generally in Town, the Images I had of the Country were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0397200205:10"/>
ſuch only as my Senſes receiv'd very early, and my Memory has ſince preſerv'd with all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages they firſt appear'd in.</p>
               <p>Hence it was that I thought our Pariſh-Church the nobleſt Structure in <hi>England,</hi> and the 'Squire's Place-Houſe, as we call'd it, a moſt magnificent Palace. I had the ſame Opinion of the Alms-Houſe in the Church-yard, and of a Bridge over the Brook that parts our Pariſh from the next. 'Twas the common Vogue of our School, That the Maſter was the beſt Scholar in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Uſher the Second. Not happening to correct theſe Notions by comparing them with what I ſaw when I came into the World, upon return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, I began to reſume my former Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and expected all Things ſhould appear in the ſame View as I left them when I was a Boy: But to my utter Diſappointment I found them wonderfully ſhrunk, and leſſen'd almoſt out of my Knowledge. I look'd with Contempt on the Tribes painted on the Church Walls, which I once ſo much admired, and on the carv'd Chimney-Piece in the 'Squire's Hall. I found my old Maſter to be a poor ignorant Pedant; and, in ſhort, the whole Scene to be extreamly chang'd for the worſe. This I could not help mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe though it be of no Conſequence in it ſelf, yet 'tis certain, that moſt Prejudices are contracted and retained by this narrow Way of Thinking, which in Matters of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are hardly ſhook off; and which we only think true, becauſe we were made to believe ſo, before we were capable to diſtinguiſh between Truth and Falſhood. But there was one Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion which I confeſs to have parted with, much to my Regret: I mean the Opinion of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Honeſty and Simplicity of Manners which I had always imagin'd to be inherent in Country People. I ſoon obſerv'd it was with them and us, as they ſay of Animals; That every Species
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0397200205:11"/>
at Land, has one to reſemble it at Sea; for 'twas eaſy to diſcover the Seeds and Principles of every Vice and Folly that one meets with in the more known World, though ſhooting up in different Forms. I took a Fancy out of the ſeveral Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants round, to furniſh the Camp; the Bar, and the Exchange, and ſome certain Chocolate and Coffee-houſes, with exact Parallels to what, in many Inſtances, they already produce. There was a drunken quarrelſome <hi>Smith,</hi> whom I have a hundred Times fancied at the Head of a Troop of Dragoons. A Weaver, within two Doors of my Kinſman, was perpetually ſetting Neighbours together by the Ears. I lamented to ſee how his Talents were miſplac'd, and imagin'd what a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure he might make in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall.</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Crop</hi> of <hi>Compton-Farm,</hi> wants nothing but a Plumb and a Gold-Chain to qualify him for the Government of the City. My Kinſman's Stable-Boy was a gibbing Companion that would always have his Jeſt. He would often put Cow-itch in the Maids Bed, pull Stools from under Folks, and lay a Coal upon their Shoes when they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep. He was at laſt turn'd off for ſome notable Piece of Roguery, and when I came away, was loitering among the Ale-houſes. Bleſs me, thought I, what a prodigious Wit would this have been with us! I could have match'd all the Sharpers between St. <hi>James</hi>'s and <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> with a notable Fellow in the ſame Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, (ſince hang'd for picking Pockets at Fairs) could he have had the Advantages of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. So nearly are the Corruptions of the Country ally'd to thoſe of the Town, with no further Difference than what is made by another Turn of Thought and Method of Living.</p>
               <p>Many more Grievances, though not of equal Importance, have been laid before me from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts of this Kingdom, which, as they fall not under any ones Cognizance ſo properly as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0397200205:12"/>
my own, oblige me to a ſpeedy and effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of them. When I was prevail'd upon to, act as Cenſor of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> I did not enough, conſider the Extent of that Province, nor how, difficult it would be to make my Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the remoter Parts of this Iſland; for moſt of the Natives being Strangers to Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I cannot hope my Lucubrations ſhould meet with a general Reception amongſt them; and therefore I have now reſolved on an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, which I ſhall explain by the following Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

               <p>WHen I left the Town, as I ſaid before, I did not only make a ſufficient Proviſion for the Continuance of my Lucubrations, till the Time I had fix'd for my Return, but took Care to ſubſtitute one, who in caſe my Stay ſhould happen to be longer than I deſign'd, would much better have furniſhed out the uſual Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Publick expected from me. <hi>Sam Truſty,</hi> of whom I made Mention in a former Paper, was the Perſon I pitched upon to execute that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Fifty Years and upwards we have liv'd in ſo ſtrict an Intimacy, in ſo perfect an Union, that neither Times, Intereſt, Paſſions nor Opinions, have ever been able to make the leaſt Flaw in our Friendſhip. I am not aſhamed to own I have received more Advantage from his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, than from all the Academick Exerciſes; 'tis to his Inſtructions I owe the Improvement of my Underſtanding, to his Precepts and Example the forming of my Manners; and to his Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, the principal Remarks I have made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeveral States and Conditions of Mankind. As his Genius at our firſt ſetting out in the World, was much above mine, ſo he has ever ſince maintained the ſame Superiority. His Words were always few, his Arguments weighty, his Reflections juſt, his Intentions ſincere, and his Connexions were mixed with ſuch an agreeable Mirth, that I have often taken Pleaſure in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my ſelf in the Wrong, on purpoſe to excite him to ſo delightful a Reproof. A' ſudden Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0397200205:15"/>
defeated me of his Aſſiſtance, and has expoſed me to the Difficulties I have been under in reinſtating my ſelf in my former Authority. However, that he deſigned to ſerve me effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will appear by the enſuing Diſcourſe, which he intended to publiſh the Day after my Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; where in his ludicrous Way he has purſued the Directions I left him, as he takes Notice himſelf in his Introduction. I was unwilling the World ſhould be deprived of one Line of his Writing, and conſequently could not well omit what the Exceſs of his Affection prompted him to ſay in my Favour, and which is perhaps the only Inſtance that can be given of his Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>My very good Friend <hi>Iſaac Bickerſtaff,</hi> being indiſpenſably obliged to viſit ſome Relations in the Country theſe Holy-Days: That there may be no Interruption of Juſtice in his Abſence, has deputed me to officiate for him till his Return; and his laſt Inſtructions were, to have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Regard to the Intereſt of the Fair Sex, of which he has all along ſhewn himſelf a profeſs'd and conſtant Admirer. I am ſenſible how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal my Talents are for ſo important a Task, nor are our different Sentiments upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a leſs Obſtruction to the Performance of what he has enjoin'd me, than my Want of Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to fill the Place of ſo worthy and great a Perſon.

It has ever been thought natural to People advanced in Years, as I am,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0397200205:16"/>
to declaim upon the Vices of the Age they live in; but I am far from believing we are half ſo wicked as we ſay we are; and being a pretty ſtrict Enquirer into Humane Nature, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to trace all Things up to their original Cauſes, I am fully perſwaded, that a malignant Love of Detraction is the reigning Vice of our Times; and could we but eradicate the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Practice of Railing and Defamation, we ſhould appear to be much upon the Level with our Predeceſſors, and not worſe than the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about us. <hi>Zeno,</hi> the Founder of the Stoick Philoſophy, had ſo little Indulgence for the Frailties and Infirmities of Mankind, that he eſteemed the minuteſt Deviation from the Rules of Reaſon and Juſtice, to be of equal Weight with the moſt horrid Crimes, and groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Impieties; ſo ſtealing an Apple, by his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, was as great a Sin as committing Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; and the throwing at Cocks on <hi>Shrove-Tueſday</hi> would have been reckoned as heinous an Offence, as murthering ones Father in cold Blood.

They have lately ſet upon her Reputation at my Lady <hi>Swaddles,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rendezvous of reverend Female Elders, conſiſting of Antiquated Prudes, Superannuated Belles, and Coquets of Fifty Five. Her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſtroaking the downy Honours of her Chin, with a hoarſe maſculine Voice, pronounced her guilty of Incontinency, cheating at Play, Theft, and drinking to Exceſs: What an Accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Enormities! How ſevere are theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the Reputation of a young Lady?
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0397200205:17"/>
And had ſhe not a Greatneſs of Mind ſuperior to their Malice, which ſome no doubt will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to Impudence, I cannot ſee how ſhe could dare ſhew her Face. But I who have known her from her Infancy, think it incumbent on me to vindicate her Character, and make no Queſtion, in very few Words, of convincing all impartial Judges, how innocent ſhe is of what they lay to her Charge. <hi>Jenny Filch</hi> was brought up at a Boarding-School, where Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of both Sexes were promiſcuouſly receiv'd. From a Girl ſhe hated a Sedentary Life; ſo little Progreſs was made in the Sampler. Her Humour was brisk and jovial, her Conſtitution ſanguine and vigorous, which led her to delight in robuſt Diverſions; ſuch as Trap-ball, Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle-cat, Britiſh-hoppers, Nine-pins, and Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Tops. To ſhare in their Sports, ſhe was fain to be much among the Boys; ſhe grew from thence to love their Company extreamly, and has gradually continued the Affection ever ſince. I am forced to explain this Matter very particularly, becauſe ſhe has been often twitted by the Ladies for liking to be with the Fellows rather than with them. As ſhe is a very little Obſerver of Forms, ſhe ſeldom could endure to be under the Reſtraint of a ſet Dreſs, but rather chuſe, with ſome one Friend, to go in a Mob, and a Mask, into the Pit at a Play, than to ſit in a Box. The Vivacity of her Wit, and the Smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Repartees, drew conſtantly all the young Beaux about her. This Humour of hers it ſeems took mightily; and ſhe would often prevail upon thoſe Ladies of her Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whoſe Husbands were beyond Sea, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of Compaſſion, rather than to ſit moping and melancholy at Home, to go along with her; and in ſhort, did all ſhe could to procure them ſuch Diverſions, as might make them leſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their 'Spouſe's Abſence. When the Play
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0397200205:18"/>
was near done, no Body was more nice in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome of the moſt civil and harmleſs Men to lead them to a Coach; and becauſe Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Coachmen are often very rude and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, they would now and then for Protection permit them to ſtep in, and perhaps drive to <hi>Phillips</hi>'s, juſt to refreſh their Spirits. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if they were very well aſſured of the Gentlemen's Behaviour, they would in a Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick venture to ear a Frigaſee at <hi>Pontacks,</hi> but never failed to be back by Twelve. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there was a great Pother about Two or Three of her Companions, who at their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Return, were very near encreaſing their Family. But how ſhe is to blame all this while, no Body can ſay 'twas her doing; let every one anſwer for their own Follies: And this is all I ever heard alledged againſt her upon the firſt Article.</p>
                  <p>Now, as to cheating at Play, I ſuppoſe, what miſlead them into that Opinion, was her great Skill and Dexterity in all Tricks at Cards: For having very fine Fingers, ſhe took a great deal of Pleaſure in learning whatever the famous <hi>High German</hi> could teach her in that Art, wherein ſhe grew ſo great a Proficient, that in a ſhort Time ſhe out-did her Maſter. Twice or Thrice a Week (meerly for Amuſement) ſhe would paſs the Evening at <hi>Langteral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

She would make nothing of ſhewing Three Loo's in Five Deals, to the great Wonder and Surprize of all the Company. But as this was only done for Diverſion, ſhe choſe to play ſo low, that ſhe ſeldom carried off above Four or Five Pounds, juſt to pay her Chair, and buy clean Gloves; what they mean by Theft, I can't imagine, unleſs 'twas ſlipping now and then a

This, it ſeems, is a here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Piece of Furniture ſhe is very fond of; it came from <hi>Italy</hi> long ago, the Inſide is curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly painted, wherein are repreſented the Loves of <hi>Endymion</hi> and the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

She ever loved to have Things neat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, and only wanted ſome few Pieces of China to place upon the Top of this Cabinet, but being a notable Houſewife, ſhe could not endure to ſquander away her Money upon ſuch Baubles; ſo when ſhe went with any of her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to Shops that deal in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

'Tis ten to one ſome ſcrupulous People will be apt to call this Pilfering; but let them conſider, no Body ever more exactly obſerved the Rules of Juſtice, in all the Meaſures ſhe took, to ſupply her ſelf with thoſe Conveniencies. Every Shop contributed but barely its Share, and the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then being equally laid, (ſo far from giving Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Complaint) the Loſs was ſcarce felt by any Body; beſides, ſhe made them ample A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends by commending their Goods, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Cuſtom. I may add in her Behalf, that what ſhe did was meerly in Conformity of the Faſhion: Every Lady's Cabinet was cover'd with China; ſhe could not well afford to buy it, What ſhould ſhe do? It has been a receiv'd Saying, <hi>One had as good be out of the World, as out of the Faſhion;</hi> from whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, thoſe Things are as neceſſary as Meat and Drink; and no Body was ever accounted a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal

                     <hi>Jenny</hi> has a voluble Tongue, and loves to exerciſe it, that I cannot but own ſhe often talks her ſelf into a Heat, and that cauſes Thirſt; ſometimes by an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mind, pretty incident to her, ſhe will call for Glaſs after Glaſs, without remembring, ſhe drank but the Minute before. Now, this may prove ſhe has a ſhort Memory indeed; but how to infer the <hi>Love of Wine</hi> from hence, I cannot ſee. The Miſtake however is eaſy to be accounted for. The Negligence of her Dreſs, her fluſter'd Complexion, her great Loquacity ſometimes, and her incoherent Anſwers to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when her Thoughts are wandering, often concur to make her look as if ſhe were actually in Drink: But is this an equitable Way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?

               <p>LEaning out of my Window this Morning, I obſerv'd a Young Gentleman paſs under it, whoſe Face I was ſure to have ſeen, but could not preſently recollect his Name. The Oddneſs of his Figure help'd to diſguiſe him; for, though otherwiſe decent enough, he had a Napkin-Cap on his Head; and at the ſame Time, by the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of his Air, gave one to underſtand, that he thought himſelf dreſs'd for the whole Day. In this Manner he walk'd on to the End of our Lane, then turn'd ſhort upon his Heel, and hurry'd back again with the utmoſt Precipitation. By this Time I had made a ſhift to remember, that this was the ſame Young Gentleman whom I formerly made Mention of, in order to recommend a Play of his to the World. There was Merit enough in that Performance to make me a Well-wiſher to the Author, and as much Wit as might make him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of an odd Turn in his Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>I was ſorry to ſee him thus expos'd, and bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd him up to me; he came in great Confuſion, and without giving me Time to ask any Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, told me, <hi>he was particularly aſham'd to be ſeen by a Man of my Character, in ſo heedleſs a Way, that indeed he had come out in ſome haſt, and forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t his Hat and Perriwig.</hi> By his aukward Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of excuſing himſelf, I ſoon found the Cauſe of his Diſorder; that it was purely Artificial, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0397200205:22"/>
lay rather in his Heart than his Head. 'Twas with great Indignation I heard his Apology, and had not I been ſtrongly prejudic'd in the young Man's behalf, I ſhould hardly have afforded him the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a Rebuke. After ſome Enquiry, I found by him, that this Inadvertency had coſt him much Pains and Induſtry to acquire, and that by long Uſe, it was now improv'd into a Habit.</p>
               <p>He freely own'd, that this was a Method he had often took to diſtinguiſh and recommend himſelf as a Wit, and that he had hitherto met with good Succeſs. I was a little pacify'd with the Frankneſs of this Confeſſion, and encourag'd him to proceed in it.—<q rend="inline">'To tell you the Truth, Sir, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I was led into this Error ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry young, and the Occaſion of it perhaps may give you Diverſion. 'Twas a Cuſtom at the Great School where I was bred, frequently to call over the Names of the Boys, in the Preſence of the Maſter.

When I came to the Univerſity, I expected to be laugh'd out of my Fooleries; but inſtead of that, I was every Day more confirm'd in them.

I cannot help adding a Word or Two upon this Humour of ſetting up for a Wit, by perſonating a different Conduct from others, in the Common Actions of Life. The rather, becauſe within the Compaſs of my own Obſervation, it has depriv'd the World of many uſeful Perſons, and eclips'd many valuable Qualifications. It has certainly been the Misfortune of ſeveral Great Men, to have had ſomething ſingular in their Gate, their Diet, and even in their Converſation it ſelf. They who have follow'd the profounder Studies, appear of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to have their thoughts diſtracted, as 'tis par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obſerv'd of Mathematicians, their Minds being ſo ſteddily fix'd, that they cannot eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend them.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that others, imagining the Merit lies in the Singularity, are glad to find it ſo eaſie a Matter to diſtinguiſh themſelves; the Deſire of doing which I take to be the Root of all Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To ſay Truth, the Men of Wit have, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, their Share in theſe Imperfections. For as more ſevere Studies require a very cloſe Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, theirs perhaps ingage it too little, and their Spirits are too volatile to give a long and conſtant Attention. This Abſence of theirs, if I may ſo ſpeak, my Couſin <hi>Humphry</hi> calls a Tax upon great Genius's, and ſays, he thinks it a Happineſs, when a Man of eminent Parts has nothing Particular to be known by, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he walks the Street, or appears in Company. For which Reaſon, in talking over the Characters of Ingenious Men, I am frequently offended to hear People dwell upon ſome odd Circumſtances in their Behaviour. A certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor about Town is much celebrated for writing all his Works upon Backs of Letters, and Scraps of Paper. Another writ the beſt Part of his Poem upon old Cards, and had like to have loſt Ten of the fineſt Lines in it, upon an Ace of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, which he had unluckily miſplac'd. A
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0397200205:25"/>
Third, of Immortal Memory, was wont to lie in his Perriwig, and caught a Cold that deſtroy'd him, by waſhing his Hands. Theſe and many other Singularities obſervable in Men of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Talents, might, for ought one knows, be natural to them. But when <hi>Papilio</hi> ſtudies for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent Anſwers to every Queſtion that is ask'd him, and makes Appointments on purpoſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them; 'tis a Queſtion amongſt the Curious, Whether the Humour be natural or affected? I think it the moſt favourable Opinion, that there is a Mixture of both. I have often with great Pleaſure conſidered the Character of my Friend <hi>Urbanus,</hi> whoſe great Wit and Learning are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed accompanied with Singularities, ſuch as are altogether Natural, but will, I doubt, meet with few Imitators: I mean his exceſſive Candor, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and good Nature. The Affectation of theſe Qualities would ſufficiently diſtinguiſh any one that would be at the Pains to tranſcribe them, and the Conſequences of it would be of Service to the World. But to copy the Infirmities only of Great Men, and to quote their Example in our Defence, is making Precedents of them, where they leaſt deſire to be ſo, and perverting their Authority to give a Sanction to Folly.</p>

               <p>AMongſt other Severities I have met with from ſome Criticks, the crueleſt for an Old Man is, that they will not let me be at quiet in my Bed, but purſue me to my very Dreams. I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0397200205:26"/>
muſt not dream but when they pleaſe, nor upon long continued Subjects, however Viſionary in their own Natures; becauſe there is a manifeſt Moral quite thro' them, which to produce as a Dream is improbable and unnatural. The Pain I might have had from this Objection, is prevented by conſidering they have miſſed another, againſt which I ſhould have been at a Loſs to defend my ſelf. They ſhould have ask'd me whether the Dreams I publiſh can properly be call'd <hi>Lucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which is the Name I have given to all my Papers, whether in Volumes or Half-ſheets: So manifeſt a Contradiction <hi>in Terminis,</hi> that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Sophiſter ever thought of it: But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Cavil. I remember when I was a Boy at School, I have often dream'd out the whole Paſſages of a Day; that I rode a Journey, bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſupp'd, went to Bed, and roſe the next Morning; and I have known young Ladies who would dream a whole Contexture of Adventures in one Night large enough to make a Novel. In Youth the Imagination is ſtrong, not mix'd with Cares, nor tinged with thoſe Paſſions that moſt diſturb and confound it, ſuch as Avarice, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and many others. Now as old Men are ſaid to grow Children again, ſo in this Article of Dreaming, I am returned to my Childhood. My Imagination is at full Eaſe, without Care, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, or Ambition to clog it, by which, among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, I have this Advantage of doubling the ſmall Remainder of my Time, and living Four and Twenty Hours in the Day. However, the Dream I am now going to relate, is as wild as can well be imagined, and to pleaſe theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers upon Sleep, without any Moral that I can diſcover.<q>It happen'd that my Maid left on the Table in my Bed-Chamber, one of her Story-Books (as ſhe calls them) which I took up, and found full of ſtrange Impertinences, fitted to her Taſt and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0397200205:27"/>
Condition; of Poor Servants that came to be Ladies, and Serving-Men of low Degree, who married Kings Daughters. Among other Things I met this Sage Obſervation, that a Lion would never hurt a true Virgin: With this Medly of Nonſenſe in my Fancy I went to Bed, and dream'd that a Friend waked me in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and propoſed for Paſtime to ſpend a few Hours in ſeeing the Pariſh-Lions, which he had not done ſince he came to Town; and becauſe they ſhow'd but once a Week, he would not miſs the Opportunity. I ſaid I would humour him; tho', to ſpeak the Truth, I was not fond of thoſe cruel Spectacles, and if it were not ſo ancient a Cuſtom, founded, as I had heard, upon the wiſeſt Maxims, I ſhould be apt to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Inhumanity of thoſe who introduced it. All this will be a Riddle to the waking Reader, till I diſcover the Scene my Imagination had formed upon the Maxim, that a Lion would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hurt a true Virgin. I dream'd, that by a Law of Immemorial Time a He-Lion was kept in every Pariſh at the common Charge, and in a Place provided, adjoining to the Church-yard; That, before any one of the Fair Sex was married, if ſhe affirmed her ſelf to be a Virgin, ſhe muſt on her Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Day, and in her Wedding-Cloaths, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Ceremony of going alone into the Den, and ſtay an Hour with the Lion let looſe, and kept faſting Four and Twenty Hours on purpoſe. At a proper Height, above the Den, were convenient Galleries for the Relations and Friends of the Young Couple, and open to all Spectators. No Maiden was forced to offer her ſelf to the Lion; but if ſhe refuſed, it was a Diſgrace to marry her, and every one might have Liberty of calling her a Whore. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought it was as uſual a Diverſion to ſee the Pariſh-Lions, as with us to go to a Play or an
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0397200205:28"/>
Opera. And it was reckoned convenient to be near the Church, either for marrying the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin if ſhe eſcaped the Trial, or for burying the Bones when the Lion had devoured the reſt, as he conſtantly did.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To go on therefore with the Dream: <q>We call'd firſt (as I remember) to ſee St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s Lion, but we were told they did not ſhew to Day: From thence we went to that of <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> which, to my great Surprize, we found as lean as a Skeleton, when I expected quite the contrary; but the Keeper ſaid 'twas no Wonder at all, becauſe the poor Beaſt had not got an Ounce of Woman's Fleſh ſince he came into the Pariſh. This amaz'd me more than the other, and I was forming to my ſelf a mighty Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the Ladies in that Quarter of the Town, when the Keeper went on, and ſaid, He wonder'd the Pariſh would be at the Charge of maintaining a Lion for nothing. Friend, (ſaid I) do you call it Nothing, to juſtify the Virtue of ſo many Ladies, or has your Lion loſt his diſtinguiſhing Faculty? Can there be any Thing more for the Honour of your Pariſh, than that all the Ladies married in your Church were pure Virgins? That is true, (ſaid he) and the Doctor knows it to his Sorrow, for there has not been a Couple married in our Church ſince his Worſhip has been amongſt us. The Virgins hereabouts are too wiſe to venture the Claws of the Lion; and becauſe no Body will marry them, have all entered into Vows of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity. So that in Proportion we have much the largeſt Nunnery in the whole Town. This Manner of Ladies entring into a Vow of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, becauſe they were not Virgins, I eaſily conceiv'd, and my Dream told me, that the whole Kingdom was full of Nunneries, plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtock'd from the ſame Reaſon.
<p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0397200205:29"/>
We went to ſee another Lion, where we found much Company met in the Gallery, the Keeper told us, we ſhould ſee Sport enough, as he call'd it; and in a little Time, we ſaw a young beautiful Lady put into the Den, who walk'd up towards the Lion with all imaginable Security in her Countenance, and look'd ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon her Lover and Friends in the Gallery; which I thought nothing extraordinary, becauſe it was never known that any Lion had been miſtaken. But however, we were all Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for the Lion lifted up his Right Paw, which was the fatal Sign, and advancing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſeized her by the Arm, and began to tear it: The poor Lady gave a terrible ſhriek, and cry'd out, <hi>The Lion is juſt, I am no true Virgin,</hi> Oh! <hi>Sappho, Sappho.</hi> She could ſay no more, for the Lion gave her the <hi>Coup de Grace,</hi> by a ſqueeze in the Throat, and ſhe expir'd at his Feet. The Keeper dragg'd away her Body to feed the Animal when the Company was gone, for the Pariſh Lions never uſed to eat in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. After a little Pauſe, another Lady came on towards the Lion in the ſame Manner as the former; we obſerv'd the Beaſt ſmell her with great Diligence, he ſcratch'd both her Hands with lifting them to his Noſe, and clapping a Claw on her Boſom, drew Blood; however he let her go, and at the ſame Time turned from her with a So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t of Contempt, at which ſhe was not a little mortify'd, and retired with ſome Confuſion to her Friends in the Gallery. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought the whole Company immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Meaning of this, that the Eaſineſs of the Lady had ſuffered her to admit certain impudent and dangerous Familiarities, border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much upon what is Criminal; neither was it ſure whether the Lover then preſent had not ſome Sharers with him in thoſe Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0397200205:30"/>
of which a Lady can never be too ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
                     <p>This happened to be an extraordinary Day, for a Third Lady came into the Den, laughing loud, playing with her Fan, toſſing her Head, and ſmiling round on the young Fellows in the Gallery. However, the Lion leap'd on her with great Fury, and we gave her for gone; but on a ſudden he let go his Hold, turned from her as if he were nauſeated, then gave her a Laſh with his Tail; after which ſhe returned to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, not the leaſt out of Countenance: And this, it ſeems, was the uſual Treatment of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.</p>
                     <p>I thought we had now ſeen enough, but my Friend would needs have us go and viſit One or Two Lions in the City. We call'd at Two or Three Dens where they happen'd not to ſhew, but we generally found half a Score young Girls, between Eight and Eleven Years Old, playing with each Lion, ſitting on his Back, and putting their Heads into his Mouth; ſome of them would now and then get a Scratch; but we always diſcover'd, upon examining, that they had been hoydening with the young Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices. One of them was calling to a pretty Girl of about Twelve Years, that ſtood by us in the Gallery, to come down to the Lion, and upon her Refuſal, ſaid, <hi>Ah, Miſs</hi> Betty, <hi>we could never get you to come near the Lion, ſince you play'd at Hoop and Hide with my Brother in the Garret.</hi> We followed a Couple, with the Wedding Folks, goint to the Church of St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Ax</hi>'s. The Lady, though well ſtricken in Years, extremely crooked and deform'd, was dreſs'd out beyond the Gaiety of Fifteen; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving jumbled together, as I imagin'd, all the Tawd'ry Remains of Aunts, Godmothers, and Grandmothers, for ſome Generations paſt:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0397200205:31"/>
One of the Neighbours whiſper'd me that ſhe was an Old Maid, and had the cleareſt Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any in the Pariſh. There is nothing ſtrange in that, thought I, but was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd when I obſerv'd afterwards that ſhe went towards the Lion with Diſtruſt and Concern. The Beaſt was lying down, but upon Sight of her, ſnuff'd up his Noſe Two or Three Times, and then giving the Sign of Death, proceeded inſtantly to Execution. In the midſt of her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies, ſhe was heard to name the Words, <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Artifices,</hi> with the utmoſt Horror, and ſeveral repeated Execrations: And at laſt concluded, <hi>Feel that I was, to put ſo much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Toughneſs of my Skin!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Keeper immediately ſet all in order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for another Cuſtomer, which happened to be a famous Prude, whom her Parents after long Threatnings, and much Perſwaſion, had with the extreameſt Difficulty prevailed on to accept a young handſome Goldſmith, that might have pretended to five Times her Fortune. The Fathers and Mothers in the Neighbourhood uſed to quote her for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to their Daughters. Her Elbows were rivetted to her Sides, and her whole Perſon ſo order'd as to inform every Body that ſhe was afraid they ſhould touch her. She only drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to approach the Lion, becauſe it was a He one, and abhorr'd to think an Animal of that Sex ſhould preſume to breathe on her. The Sight of a Man at Twenty Yards Diſtance made her draw back her Head. She always ſate upon the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Corner of the Chair, tho' there were Six Chairs between her and her Lover, and with the Door wide open, and her little Siſter in the Room. She was never ſaluted but at the Tip of her Ear, and her Father had much ado to make her dine without her Gloves when there
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0397200205:32"/>
was a Man at Table. She enter'd the Den with ſome Fear, which we took to proceed from the Height of her Modeſty, offended at the Sight of ſo many Men in the Gallery. The Lion beholding her at a Diſtance, immediately gave the deadly Sign; at which the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (methinks I ſee her ſtill) miſcarried in a Fright before us all. The Lion ſeem'd to be ſurpris'd as much as we, and gave her Time to make her Confeſſion, <hi>That ſhe was Four Months gone, by the Fore-man of her Father's Shop, that this was her Third big Belly;</hi> and when her Friends ask'd, why ſhe would venture the Trial? She ſaid, <hi>her Nurſe aſſured her, that a Lion would never hurt a Woman with Child.</hi>" Upon this I immediately wak'd, and could not help wiſhing, that the Deputy-Cenſors of my late Inſtitution were indu'd with the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct as theſe Pariſh Lions were.</p>

               <p>Thus, as I before hinted, the beſt Part of my Time is ſet apart for the Service and true Intereſt of the Fair. Many ſleepleſs Nights, and Days of Anxiety, they have coſt me. Yet for all this, I do not find that I have any Degree of Intereſt in their Perſons, or any Reſtraint upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Not a Furbelow has been ſunk, nor a Yard of Whalebone parted with, to oblige me. Even my moſt gentle Corrections and Penny-Poſt Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, have met with Neglect, Scorn and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance. <hi>Bellaria</hi> is a provoking Inſtance of this Kind; it has in good Earneſt ſtood me in Three-Pence to reform her, and I do not find that ſhe is One Farthing the better for it. She is young, 'tis true, and may live to be wiſer: As her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty goes off, Prudence perhaps will grow upon her; but to be diſcreet in the Height of her Charms, would be a much greater Merit. She knows the Faults I have charged her with, and muſt thank her ſelf if ſhe ſhould hereafter
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0397200205:36"/>
oblige me to be more open and particular. <hi>Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> with the ſame Aggravation, continues to be haughty, inſolent, and unnatural. She is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Five beautiful Children, the eldeſt not above Seven Years Old, whom ſhe never ſpeaks to, but with a Deſign to teize them, and uſes worſe than any Animals that belong to her. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her Coach the other Day, ſhe obſerv'd Two or Three of them diverting themſelves in the Hall, and turning to her People, asked the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why thoſe Brats lay litt'ring about the Houſe. Miſs <hi>Molly</hi> was ſeverely whip'd within this Week, for calling her Mother behind her back; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Neddy</hi> taken from Table, for ſeeming only to want his Dinner before the <hi>Italian</hi> Greyhound had been fed.</p>
               <p>I have met with a Caſe yet more extraordinary, and which has given me much Uneaſineſs; Tho' I cannot ſay of ſo Criminal a Nature as the latter. Taking a Turn in the <hi>Park</hi> about a Month ſince, I ſaw a Paper lie upon the Ground, which I had the Curioſity to ſtoop for, and found to be a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe.</hi>

               <p>I was very much ſurpris'd at ſo odd a Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and having formerly had the Honour to know the Lady for whoſe Uſe it was intended, cou'd not help inquiring into the Occaſion of it:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0397200205:37"/>
With ſome Difficulty I inform'd my ſelf, that <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> whom all the World admir'd, was very lately diſpleas'd with her own Perſon. Some good natur'd Friend, it ſeems, had put it in her Head that ſhe was growing too fat, and in a little Time wou'd be out of all Shape. This ſufficiently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd her, and from a Gaiety of Temper, that was peculiar to her, ſhe fell into Spleen, Vapours, and a Thouſand imaginary Diſquiets. There was no Abſurdity ſo groſs that her Fears did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon her. As ſhe paſs'd the Streets in her Chair, ſhe expected every Moment that the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows wou'd ſink under their Burden, and wou'd often ſay to her ſelf, <hi>Bleſs me, how the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures blow!</hi> My Lady <hi>Kill-Chairman</hi>'s Shape was become the Object of her Envy, as it had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been the Subject of her Ridicule. In ſhort, a Conſultation of the moſt eminent Phyſicians was reſolv'd on, and a Courſe of Acids, <hi>Cum Regimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> was, it ſeems, the Reſult of it. As ſoon as this came to my Knowledge, I ſent <hi>Clorinda</hi> a Letter, full of ſuch preſſing Remonſtrances, as the Occaſion ſuggeſted to me. I conjur'd her with all the Tenderneſs of a Gallant, not to ſuffer ſo much Beauty to be loſt to the World, by being over-curious to preſerve it; nor that Bloom to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thro' an irreligious Mortification of her ſelf.</p>
               <p>After taking ſo much Pains, to ſee my Advice neglected, and other Meaſures purſu'd, has, I own, ſenſibly touch'd me, both as an old Man, and a graduate Phyſician. However, it is yet in the Power of <hi>Clorinda</hi> to retrieve what is paſs'd: She has nothing more to do than to eat, drink, and ſleep, to make her ſelf again the Joy of her Friends, the Deſire of Mankind; and what is yet greater, (without Vanity be it ſaid) to be heartily forgiven by the Cenſor of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>

               <p>'TIS a common Miſtake, tho' of very ill Conſequence, that many Failings and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities are too cloſely woven into our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ever to be removed by any Pains or Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our own. Had I ſuffer'd my ſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, I had been now one of the peeviſheſt old Fellows, as I was formerly one of the moſt paſſionate Youths, in the World. Till the Age of Sixteen I was never in good Humour two Hours together. I thought my ſelf affronted by every one I met, and grew into a Proverb for the Violence of my Reſentments. I no ſooner came to the Uſe of my Reaſon, but I began to cool a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, and have ever ſince preſerved ſuch an Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper as is not eaſily ruffled, and which, under the greateſt Difficulties and Diſtreſſes, has made me ſuperior to them all.</p>
               <p>I remember one Thing of my ſelf in the Days of my Minority that was pleaſant enough: When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any Body had done me an ill Office, I uſed, in the Bitterneſs of my Heart, to wiſh my ſelf Parſon of the Pariſh for their Sake. He, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, had once a Week the Privilege of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0397200205:39"/>
his Mind in publick, and of telling his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners their own. This, I thought, was a mighty Relief to his Spleen, and indeed the Doctor made Uſe of it as if he had been of the ſame Opinion. He had a particular Felicity in finding out Texts to his Purpoſe, and no one Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence could be committed againſt him, that did not appear the next <hi>Sunday</hi> to be literally forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Scripture. The Top Gentleman in the Pariſh having one Day made him a Viſit in a ſtriped Night-Gown, he looked upon this <hi>Diſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee</hi> as a Mark of Contempt; and the very next Time the Pulpit was his own, giving a Side-Glance towards the 'Squire's Pew, he pronounced with a loud Voice, <hi>Stripes are for the Backs of Fools,</hi> &amp;c. A poor Taylor had cabbaged ſome black Cloth that was put into his Hands, and the Text choſen for his Reprimand was, <hi>Hell and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction are before them;</hi> though towards the End of the Diſcourſe it was allowed, that <hi>a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This petulant Humour of proſtituting a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Capacity to particular Reſentments, is what I have induſtriouſly avoided throughout the whole Courſe of my Lucubrations. After the many Obſervations I have made upon humane Nature, it is, I confeſs, ſome Pleaſure to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them to the Publick in the Manner I have choſe to do it: But, unleſs in Caſes where my Reputation has been openly attacked, I have never once intereſted the World in any Diſputes relating to my ſelf. Every Body knows what Provocations Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> gave me, and in how crowded a Theatre, before I would deſcend to take any Notice of him. When I did, it was in ſuch a Manner, I thought, as all Controverſy ought to be managed between Scholars and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen. Mr. <hi>Morphew</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lillie</hi> obliged me to draw my Pen againſt them by a Piece of Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0397200205:40"/>
that is hardly to be matched in Hiſtory. I had always treated thoſe Perſons with a Reſpect due to their Characters, and as our Intereſts were mutual, I flattered my ſelf that our Affections were ſo too. I know I ſhall ſuffer in the Opinion of ſome unforgiving People, when I make it known, that after ſuch repeated Indignities I have again taken them into Favour. But as the following Petition was introduced to me by ſome of the firſt Quality in this Kingdom, I can deny nothing to their Commands, nor indeed to the Dictates of my own Humanity.</p>

Perquiſites thereof. In order to which, we, in the moſt humble Senſe of our Crimes, and fill'd with a deep and hearty Sorrow for the ſame, do beg for our ſelves and for each other, That the Suſpenſion now lying on the ſaid <hi>Charles Lillie,</hi> as alſo the late Sentence of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation pronounced on the ſaid <hi>John Morphew,</hi> may be cancell'd and revers'd, in full Form, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Method, purſuant to the Rules and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Court.</p>

               <p>It was an infinite Pleaſure to me the Day after I had reinſtated the Petitioners, to ſee the Faces of my old Officers about me. However, I would not have Mr. <hi>Kidney</hi> be in the leaſt diſcouraged. The little Time he has been in Employment has raiſed in me a juſt Eſteem for his good Qualities; and it is for his Sake that I give the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Advertiſement a Place in this Part of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</p>
               <q>At St. <hi>James</hi>'s Coffeehouſe is to be ſpoken with a young Man, who can give a good Account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and has by long Pains and Study, acquired many uſeful Qualifications. He perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Art of making all Sorts of warm Liquors, has made great Proficiency in Geography, Politicks, and Arithmetick, writes ſeveral good Hands, and can toſs up a Ragoo, if Occaſion be. He can ſhave, dreſs, tie up a Periwig, or take the Diſtance
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0397200205:42"/>
of Places. He is willing to go abroad and ſee the World with any young Gentleman that travels next Spring, or to be a Tutor in a Man of Quality's Family.</q>
               <p>Before I conclude, I am to acquaint my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, That as I have again received my old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, I have likewiſe renewed my former Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of continuing this Work three Times a Week; ſo, adviſing Mrs. <hi>A.

               <p>THat Activity or Reſtleſneſs of Thought, that Deſire of doing ſomething, which is natural to almoſt every Body, does, when rightly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, give Birth to many great and noble Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes; but when it falls under the Direction of a fantaſtical Judgment, it becomes troubleſome and ridiculous to all the World. On one Side, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the Characters of the greateſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and the wiſeſt Stateſmen; and on the other, it furniſhes publick Converſations with Buſy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Buffoons. I have obſerved <hi>Will Worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> for a long Time about this Town labouring under a prodigious Impatience of being diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd as a Man of ſome Sort of Figure or other. At his firſt coming from the Univerſity, he ſet up for a great Unbeliever; for which Reaſon, as likewiſe becauſe he was afraid to be in a Room by himſelf, he ſpent moſt of his Time at the <hi>Graecian.</hi> But not arriving to any great Eminence in Infidelity, he turned himſelf with great Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Calling of a Virtuoſo. To equip himſelf for this, he travel'd twice into <hi>Italy,</hi> from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0397200205:44"/>
whence, at great Expence, he brought back a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Face, with the Reputation of knowing as much as he did when he went out. Being now greatly accompliſh'd for the Service of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he thought it was high Time to take Care of the Conſtitution; and to that End, without Fear or Wit, leap'd at once over Head and Ears into publick Buſineſs. From that Time to this he has liv'd in a profeſs'd Courſe of Gravity. I have had more frequent Opportunities of converſing with him than I could have wiſh'd. For taking me by my Age to be a Man for his Purpoſe, he has in a Manner forced himſelf upon my Acquaintance. He has told me with great Frankneſs, That he thinks it below a reaſonable Man either to laugh or drink Wine, and that he has laid down ſome Rules to himſelf as eſſential to the Character he affects: <q rend="inline">"To preſerve a ſtedfaſt Countenance, to whiſper in Coffee-houſes, to ſhave but twice a Week, and to wear but one Loop to his Hat; to read nothing but the Votes, and to keep Company with his Father. He has ſometimes ſaid with as much Pleaſure as his Face is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, Well, Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> nothing ſure is ſo ſolid a Satisfaction as Buſineſs—For my Part, I love it ſo well, that I can't like a Propoſal the worſe for having been rejected;"</q> and to do him Juſtice, he has been a true Friend to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Projects, and as good as a Father to Bills in Diſgrace. He receives more Petitions than a Firſt Miniſter, and ſolicits the Affairs of all the mad Beggars about Town. <hi>Monday</hi> laſt I was obliged upon ſome Buſineſs to go to his Levee. I found with him, over Bohea and Bread and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Juſtice <hi>Upperſide</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Marmalade.</hi> Upon my coming in, Mr. <hi>Worthleſs,</hi> who ſate next the Fire, roſe up and forced me into his Chair. The Juſtice, with an innocent Smile in his Face, and his Cane at his Mouth, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Mr. <hi>Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0397200205:45"/>
you can tell us; Pray, Sir, what are all theſe Inſurances upon Births and Marriages, will they come to any Thing or no? Before I could anſwer, he went on, Why really, Sir, I would be glad Gentlemen would conſider, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation conſiſts chiefly of Men and Women. How! ſays Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> do you make nothing of Children?"</q> The Juſtice, ſhaking his Head, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My good Friend Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> you don't take me; but what I would offer, is this, If Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are hindered, Procreation in a legal Way will ceaſe, and the Conſequence of that every one knows. However, if no Body elſe takes Notice of it, I am ſure I ſhan't—'Tis not my Buſineſs to find Faults'—</q>Mr. <hi>Worthleſs</hi> ſtopping him ſhort, cried, <q rend="inline">"Pray take me along with you; for unleſs the Perſons marrying be equal to the Perſons married, where is your Ballance? For I take it, a Nation may be over as well as under married."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Well, ſays Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> I don't love diſputing in Company, but you would have a hard Matter to make that out."</q> This weighty Converſation was interrupted by Captain <hi>Myſtery,</hi> who came in from his Round of Levees, with a Face of great Hurry and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: <q rend="inline">"Gentlemen, ſays he, you little think where I have been this Morning—Hark you Mr. <hi>Worthleſs,</hi> a Word in your Ear. All out—Ships—Command—A Blockhead and a Coward, and all their Hands to it—'Tis a little hard tho' that neither Side ſhould take any Notice of one'—</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was all I overheard of his Whiſper, when a Servant came and told Mr. <hi>Worthleſs,</hi> there were ſeveral People at the Door who deſired to ſpeak with his Honour. Leave of Audience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, the firſt that entered was Don <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liero de Triſto Figure.</hi> The Solemnity of his Air, joined with the miſerable Habit he was in, was a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0397200205:46"/>
moſt exquiſite Burleſque upon the Humour of his Country. He had in his Hand a Bundle of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, much obſcured with Filth, and of a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy not to be endured. Theſe he preſented to the Patriot, who gave me to underſtand, that they contained a ſhort and eaſy Expedient to ſettle the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> on the Throne of <hi>Spain,</hi> whiſpering at the ſame Time, that he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believed this Gentleman to be of the Blood Royal.</p>
               <p>The next, as I underſtood from him, was one Mrs. <hi>James,</hi> a little ancient Gentlewoman, in a Pair of very high Pattins, who, with much Anxiety and Hunger in her Countenance, deſired his Honour, with a low Voice, and in a Language that I hardly underſtood, <q rend="inline">"To attend her Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Houſe, for that it was now juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to come on;"</q> and it ſeems it has been in the ſame Forwardneſs for theſe Thirty Years paſt. She withdrew with great Humility, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courteſies, to make Room for a Third. Mr. <hi>Worthleſs</hi> took me aſide, and told me, <q rend="inline">"That this was a Gentleman who in his younger Days ſtudied the Law; but having failed in that, had now put himſelf into the fantaſtical Habit I ſaw, and under it was one of the deepeſt Heads in the World. He has attended me, ſays he, theſe Three Years, with a Project to ſave <hi>England,</hi> and I know not yet whether I ſhall bring it to bear."</q> I was by this Time heartily tired, and in proper Form took Leave of the Company, not knowing whether I ought moſt to commiſerate the Misfortunes of theſe poor Wretches, or contemn and expoſe the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of their Patron.</p>

I was ſo pleaſed with the Style and Orthography of it, that I could not but wonder at the Careleſneſs of the Perſon who, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, after writing an Anſwer, had left ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable a Piece behind him; and knowing no readier Way to put it into his Hands again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make it publick by the firſt Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

                     <p>THough I happen to be deſcended from a Melancholy Father, and a Hypochondrix Mother, I was not till my Fortieth Year made ſenſible that Infirmities of this Kind are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from Parents to their Children. 'Twas about that Time that the College Clock run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mightily in my Head, I could not help fancying my ſelf to be ſo nearly related to it, that I was obliged not to ſpeak but when that ſtrook. My Couſin, the Clock happening ſoon after to be down with a Diſorder, I heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him for a Week together, during which Time I could not be prevailed upon to ſpeak one Syllable; and it being my Turn to read a publick Lecture, I was forced to ſend my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe in Writing.</p>
                     <p>This Fit going off, I was my ſelf for Half a Year afterwards; but ſitting much by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Room Fire, I had a ſtrange Fancy that I was a Poker, and if any Body talked of filling a Pipe, I immediately moved off for fear they ſhould make Uſe of me to light it. Upon the leaſt Indiſpoſition, I had no Notion of going to any Body but the Smith to be mended. After this, I took my ſelf for the College Gate, and lay under a conſtant Apprehenſion of being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely thumped at all Hours of the Night.

Would you think it, Sir? At laſt this Whim went ſo far, that I verily believed my ſelf to be your Paper, the <hi>Tatler,</hi> Then, though I had ſometimes the Pleaſure of thinking that I was mightily commended, at others I had inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Fears. I fancied, that a Friend of mine who had taken Phyſick, was looking for me high and low on a very unworthy Occaſion, and was wonderfully delighted when my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Gazette,</hi> was made Uſe of in my Stead. I was often vexed at my Heart to be hung al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all over with Advertiſements of Inſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Morning-Gowns, Lap-Dogs, and Lottery Tickets, and now and then had terrible Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs for having made bold with my Betters. Being at length pretty well recovered of this Fit, I thought it adviſable to come to <hi>London</hi> and take Care of my Health: But as I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Coach, to my great Surprize, I found my ſelf turned into a Foot-ball, and at the Mercy of a Pack of Scoundrels, who, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Dignity of my former Characters, kicked me from one End of the <hi>High-ſtreet</hi> to the other. During this laſt Misfortune, I have been made the unwilling Inſtrument of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Windows, and once of flying in the Face of a Civil Magiſtrate. For this Reaſon I am, as you may very well imagine, aſhamed to ſhew my Head; and being from my Spherical Figure incapable of Writing my ſelf, I have begged a Friend to conſult you in my Name up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this my deplorable Condition, and to tell you, that I hope in ſome Time I ſhall be able to aſſure you of my being my own Man, and</p>

Amongſt the reſt, he ſhewed me many Inſtances of the Sublime in the Holy Writings, which I had not heard any one before obſerve; ſo that upon the Whole, all the Difference I could find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us both in Point of knowing the World, was, that he had been chiefly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with the beſt Part of it, and I with the worſt.</p>
               <p>This Day Sevennight in the Morning Mr. <hi>Truſty</hi> preſented me another new Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: <q rend="inline">"Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> ſays he, this is Dr. — I know you will be pleaſed with one another."</q> Having never heard the Name before, I concluded him not very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in his Profeſſion. He had no Haſte in his Countenance, and ſate with me above two Hours without any viſible Impatience to be going. He appeared to have Abundance of good Nature without the ſneaking mercenary Affectation of it, and mentioned with Honour as many of his own Profeſſion as are allowed to deſerve it. He received no Meſſage all the while we were together; and I obſerved par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that he diſcourſed often as if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Revealed Religion. We dined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he carved up a Pullet without read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0397200205:56"/>
a Lecture of Anatomy upon it. He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of a facetious Wit, and after a few Glaſſes of Wine would now and then let off a Quibble, without thinking it any Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Underſtanding. I took the firſt Opportunity to enquire of my Friend into the Character of this Gentleman, whoſe Account was, That he had many Years belonged to the Faculty, that he was an admirable Scholar, and very knowing in his Profeſſion; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born a Gentleman, and to a competent Fortune of his own, he diſdained the ſervile Ways of making Court to Nurſes and Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, and therefore his chief Practice lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Poor. He never valued his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equal to the Life of a Patient, and often preſerved the latter, though by tranſgreſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Form and Method. He was once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Buſineſs, but loſt it by perſwading his Patients they were not ſick, and refuſing their Fees.</p>
               <p>The other Mr. <hi>Truſty</hi> has recommended to me, is a young Gentleman under Twenty, and a Nephew of his own. His Perſon is graceful, his Eyes quick and lively, the Tone of his Voice agreeable, his Look open, affable and ſerene, his Conſtitution vigorous and ſanguine, his Air, Dreſs and Behaviour, eaſy, modeſt and unaffected. He has been bred under the Care and Direction of his Uncle, who, I remember, often uſed to ſay to me, <q rend="inline">"I will undertake, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to make this Boy have as much uſeful Knowledge at Nineteen, as you or I have at Fifty."</q> This he has effected beyond what I could poſſibly have conceived, and the Methods he has taken to do it, ſhall hereafter in one or more of theſe Papers be communicated to the Publick. In the mean Time, it is an infinite Delight to me to find this young Man fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

What inexpreſſible Pleaſure muſt ariſe from the Reflection of having furniſhed the World with ſo extraordinary a Perſon? who, if his Merit does not hinder him, may, for half a Century, in the higheſt Stations, and moſt honourable Employments, be of publick Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the World.</p>

For my own Part, I do not remember that I ever wiſhed my ſelf from you when our Affairs would give us Leave to be together."</q> But this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, ſays I, is ſo far from being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the World, that if the Inſtitution at <hi>Dunmowe</hi> were in Favour of Friendſhip, as it is of Matrimony, I am confident there are few beſides our ſelves would have any Right to the <hi>Pramium.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"No, (ſays he) and I remember a Story of two pretty remarkable Friends of our own Time that you remind me of on this Occaſion. They had lived ſome time about Town, and being weary of mixed Company, Noiſe, and Impertinence, agreed to retire where they might without Interruption en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy one another. <hi>Nottingham</hi> was the Place reſolved on; but they had not continued

Some Third Perſon muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged into their Relief, and being acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally lodged in a Houſe next the Gaol, where a Cup of good Liquor was to be had, they ſent a Meſſage to the Gaoler, to tell him, if he was at Leiſure, there were two Gentlemen that were alone would come and ſmoak a Pipe with him. Being otherwiſe employed, he ſent his Excuſe. Upon which they went in Perſon, and asked him, If there was never an honeſt Highwayman in the Houſe that would be glad of Company? He told them he was quite out at preſent, and that if it was to ſave their Lives, he had no Body but an old Woman that was under Sentence of Death for exerciſing the Black Art, and he was ſure they would not take up with her. He happened to be miſtaken, for they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately obtained Leave to go down into the Dungeon, and there ſolaced themſelves with Ale, Brandy, and the Society of this poor unfortunate Creature, till within two Hours of her Execution.'</q>

As one every Day ſees the wretched Effects of this viciated Taſte in Converſation, Dreſs, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; I for my own Part am made more particularly ſenſible of them in the Proſecution of this Work. To ſay as much as is proper on the ſame Subject, is wearing it out, as they call it; and a Half Sheet without Four or Five Breaks has a dull heavy Look, and is offenſive to the Eyes of curious Readers; ſo that for

Without giving me Leave to anſwer for ſo inoffenſive a Member, he inſtantly drew, and took off a Piece of it at once, that reduced it to the Size of his own. This I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with ſo ſound a Blow, that ſwelled his to the Bigneſs of mine before its Amputation. Now, Sir, the Queſtion is, Whether I may not in <hi>Honour</hi> cut off his Noſe in its preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, for the ſame Reaſon he did mine before?

A bad Effect this of a moſt uſeful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution! If Church-wardens and Sides-men are thus open to Corruption, where is Juſtice and Integrity to be found? The Love of Power is without Doubt very natural to us all, and there are many Temptations in the Office of a Cenſor to juſtifie the Deſire of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

The very Heels of her Shoes are laced, her Head not above an Inch high; ſhe has Stuff enough in her Petticoat to cloath all her Brothers and Siſters, and at the ſame Time is naked her ſelf half Way down her Back.

               <p>IT is certain that moſt of our Errors, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Converſation or Conduct, are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Want of Reflection, and a right Way of Thinking. The Privilege of applying our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that Way, is the nobleſt Diſtinction of our Nature, and of the laſt Conſequence to the Regulation of our Lives. This I do not offer as a new Obſervation, but only as the general Neglect of it, and at the ſame Time the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of its being rightly underſtood, make it neceſſary to be put often in our Way. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Improvements or Acquiſitions we make without this Foundation, are but ſuperficial and Ornamental at beſt, and will never ſupport us through any Figure or Character in the World: For which Reaſon, when the Buſineſs of the Day, and the innocent Entertainments of the Evening are at an End, I conſtantly ſet apart an Hour at leaſt to deſcend into my ſelf, to weigh and examine my paſt Behaviour, and the Principles I have acted upon.

I thus ſteal from the Publick is returned to them, by endeavouring to become more perfect in the ſeveral Relations I bear to Mankind.</p>
               <p>In this Manner I was employing my Thoughts ſome Nights ago, when going towards my Window. I heard a Watchman in the Street cry, <hi>Paſt Twelve of the Clock, and a Moon-light Morning.</hi> Another, who came juſt after him, called the ſame Hour, <hi>and a cloudy Morning.</hi> He who had declared himſelf firſt, thinking his Veracity in Queſtion, turned round in ſome Anger, and in a low ſullen Voice gave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lie. Words were multiplied upon it, and Blows followed. I immediately threw up my Saſh, and had Authority enough to part them. For my own Part, I looked upon it to be a very bright Sky, and therefore gave the Fellow a Reprimand that had pronounced it otherwiſe: But when he aſſured me, that at the very Inſtant he did ſo, a Cloud was juſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over the Moon, the Cauſe was puzzled, and I did not know juſtly where to lay the Blame. However, having made up the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I pulled down my Window, and retired to Bed.

               <p>After being heartily tired with the Firſt Act, I had Leiſure to conſider the extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of theſe Foreign Entertainments, and the Diſcouragement of our own Muſick.

In this Debate, I am told they all ſpoke, and all at once; ſo it being impoſſible for them to know what each other ſaid, I could never learn the Reaſons that induced that honourable Houſe to paſs ſo cruel a Vote. Two are chiefly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged without Doors to juſtify this Severity. The Firſt is, That our Language is ſo uncooth as not to be endured, and calculated only for Acts of Parliament. The Gentleman that made this Objection, appeared at my Court Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, where being tried for Slander, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a ſmooth Defence in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, he was found guilty, and ſentenced to ſpeak no other Words than <hi>Otway</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> for the <hi>Space</hi> of Nine Days; as likewiſe to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the <hi>Mira</hi> of Mr. <hi>G—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Second Reaſon, which is, the Want of Performers, has been preſſed to me with all Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Succeſs: But the Perſons who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſo far, upon a very ſolemn Trial, were found guilty alſo by a very fair Jury, ſentenced to beg Mrs. <hi>Tofts</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Leveridge</hi>'s Pardon upon their Knees, and fined One thouſand Pound each for the Uſe of the Queen of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whoſe Treaſures are exhauſted, and her Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories invaded. I, who am advanced in Years, and have neither Leiſure nor Application for the Attainment of a Language I as yet know little of, have more than ordinary Reaſon to be apprehenſive of its encroaching too far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Should it univerſally prevail, I am in a Manner debarred the Commerce of Mankind, and my Lucubrations of Courſe fall to the Ground. I could wiſh it were further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how great Sufferers a conſiderable Part of my Fellow-Subjects would be, if we took away only the Uſe of a few Words, and whether any that can be ſubſtituted in their Stead,

would make Amends for the Loſs. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, you deprive the Lover of <hi>Angel, Goddeſs, Cupid, Charms, Darts, Flames, Fire, Sigh, Die:</hi> 'Tis plain he is undone for ever. Take from the Critick, <hi>Delicacy of Thought, Turn of Words, Propriety of Speech, Diction, Image, Genius, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime:</hi> The peeviſh Man will have very little left. Rob the Politician of <hi>Ballance of Power, Limited Monarchy, Hereditary Right, Church, State, Miniſtry:</hi> Moſt of the Coffee-houſes would break, and even that of St. <hi>James</hi>'s be very thin.</p>
               <p>After all, I am credibly informed by ſome of the Royal Society, that there is ſomething in the Formation of a Tramontane Ear, that will not ſuffer it to reliſh the Softneſs of <hi>Italian</hi> Airs; and further, that Sound it ſelf, at ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Degrees Northward, was never known to come to perfect Maturity: Only that of Drums, Trumpets, Hautboys, and here and there as much of the Vocal as will ſerve to keep a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Family in Order, being of our own Growth, and agreeing tolerably well with the Climate.</p>
               <p>For my Sentiments of Muſick in General; fitly introduced, and in its proper Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I leave them to be expreſſed by <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare,</hi> wanting Words of my own for that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>

               <p>IT is obſervable of Men of baſe Extraction and low Education, that when they have any Thing in them of what the World calls good Senſe, they turn it wholly to the getting of Money. They have but that one Point in View, and conſequently overlook all either difficult or indirect Ways which lead to it.</p>
               <p>If they attain their End, and become rich toward their middle Age, before they decline in Years, and decay in Strength, and that their Appetite of Getting is not yet turned into an Avarice of Hoarding, if they have any Fire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, they commonly feel themſelves war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a Kind of Ambition of being Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, as well as Something. They find a Want of that Reſpect which they obſerve to be paid to ſuch who are called Gentlemen, and Perſons of Condition, though of ſmall Fortunes. They would give any Conſideration to be of an honourable Deſcent, and alter the Spelling of their Names to bring them on as near as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0397200205:75"/>
to ſome Name or Seat of Antiquity. If that cannot be brought about, they puſh for a Knighthood, or an Alliance with ſome Family of Name or Title, whoſe Follies or Misfortunes have reduced them to match themſelves or Children to Money, however baſely lodged, or infamouſly obtained.</p>
               <p>I fell into this Reflection after a Viſit made me ſome Days ſince by one whom I remember to have known a Link-Boy, and who has often lighted me formerly from the <hi>Green-Dragon</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet</hi> to my Lodgings in <hi>Sheer-lane.</hi> We uſed to call him <hi>Foundling,</hi> a Name given him by his Godfather the Pariſh, and which he has not yet been able to part with, or vary, though he has found the Secret to be worth very near what they call a Plumb, and upon <hi>'Change</hi> has obtained the Appellation of a good Man. He came to me with much Frankneſs, owning both his paſt and preſent Circumſtances; but what made me, ſmile, was, the Requeſt he made me to accompany him to a Houſe in our Row, where lives one <hi>Randall</hi> (as he called him) <hi>a Creature Merchant.</hi> This Perſon is a great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo, and deals in Birds and Beaſts, though not either as a Butcher or Poulterer; for he nouriſhes nothing that is eatable, nor ever ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters any Commodity but while it is alive.</p>
               <p>As we walked towards this Virtuoſo's Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which I may call an Abridgment of the Ark, my Friend <hi>Foundling</hi> told me, <q rend="inline">"He had purchaſed a fair Seat in the Country, That he had a Mind to appear well in the World; and ſince he had a Gentleman's Eſtate, he would endeavour to have every Thing ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to it; That he had bargained already with the Herald's College for a Coat of Arms; and that his preſent Errand to <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi>'s was, from among his Variety, of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0397200205:76"/>
to fancy himſelf a Creſt, in which he mightily deſired my Aſſiſtance and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</q> I was delighted with the Folly and Frankneſs of the Man; but it happened he ſaw nothing that pleaſed him. As we returned, I adviſed him to an honeſt home-bred Creſt out of his own Farmers Yard, which was a Cock's Head untrim'd, with the Gills and Comb en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. This he approved, and took his Leave. I was about to reflect on what had paſs'd, when ſuddenly returning he called to me, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming nearer, told me, he would let me into all his Project, and deſired I would ſtep with him to a Waterman's Houſe hard by, where he had lodged a Set of Anceſtors, which were to go up next Tide to his Seat upon the River. He deſired my Judgment of the Choice he had made of Three Generations to furniſh his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor. I went with him, not readily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending what he meant, till we enter'd the Houſe, where he explained to me, that at <hi>Fleet-Ditch</hi> he had bought the Pictures of Three Men and Three Women, which were ſuited well enough to each other, and were to perſonate his Family up to his Great-Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father and Great-Grandmother, which he thought was pretending far enough for one who was in Truth related to no Body that he knew of in the World. As I was extremely diverted with the Oddneſs and Extravagance of the Man's Fancy, I was no leſs ſatisfied with his Judgment in the Choice of the Pictures; the Habits and Diſpoſitions of the Figures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuited to Three different Periods and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of Time, and concluding, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in the Great-Grandfather and Great-Grandmother, with a Pair of Trunk-Hoſe, a Ruff, and a Farthingale. I pleaſed him with my Approbation, and took Leave of him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0397200205:77"/>
my ſelf often ſince with the Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flections which naturally ariſe from the Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>templation of Vanity, Wealth, and titular Happineſs. I have ſince heard there is a Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage likely to be concluded betwixt his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter Mrs. <hi>Priſcilla Foundling</hi> and the eldeſt Son of the Lord <hi>Mortgage.</hi>

I did not mean them for your Ruin, but En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement—I ſaid, you were a good Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not an excellent Critick; pray don't mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me—Let me adviſe you to learn bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Behaviour of your Friend Mr. <hi>Penketh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> he is diverting enough upon the Stage; but off it, underſtands his Situation in Life, and is a very dull inoffenſive Kind of Man. I am informed you have great Power in your Hands as to our Theatrical Entertainments; make better Uſe of it, or reſign it quickly. The Town is as weary of your Tyranny as thoſe under your Command. To the great Injury of both, you ſuppreſs <hi>Powell, Booth,</hi> and <hi>Pack,</hi> becauſe they are better Players than your ſelf, or any of your Friends—Let me hear no more of it.—Good Night to you.</q>

My Siſter,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0397200205:82"/>
the unfortunate <hi>Fidelia,</hi> the beſt, the ſofteſt, and the faireſt of her Sex, is even now on the Brink of Diſtraction. Her Perplexity is beyond all Example, and indeed the Occaſion of it very extraordinary. It is now Three Years and upwards ſince Two young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Birth and Fortune, who had lived together in the ſtricteſt Friendſhip, became Rivals on her Account. Both ſo equally me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited her Eſteem, that for ſome Time ſhe knew not on which to beſtow her Love. The one was of an open Behaviour, warm in his Pretenſions, but not over conſtant in his Application; the other cloſe, aſſiduous, and importunate. However it happened, ſhe was at laſt determined in Favour of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and, with a Heart never before engaged in an Affair of this Kind, gave at once into all the Softneſſes and Indearments of it. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydor</hi> (if I may ſo call the neglected Lover) now found himſelf but coldly received; yet, with an unexpected Evenneſs of Temper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill to viſit my Siſter; upon the Foot of a Friend, a Platonick, or what elſe ſhe would pleaſe to call him. In the mean Time, the Father of <hi>Caſtalio,</hi> his Rival, had ſome Intimation given him of his Intrigue, and that he intended to marry <hi>Fidelia,</hi> whoſe Fortune, tho' better than Six thouſand Pounds, was by no Means anſwerable to what he propoſed for his Son. Without taking any further Notice, he ſent for him, and having a conſiderable Eſtate at <hi>Fort St. George,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> made the Care of that a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for diſpatching him thither. In ſhort, <hi>Fidelia</hi> and he were forced to part, with a Flood of Tears, and the uſual Vows to each other. Two Years almoſt paſt before any Thing was heard of him; then came the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0397200205:83"/>
News of his Death, confirmed by ſo many Hands, and ſuch particular Circumſtances, that there was no Room to doubt the Truth of it. <hi>Polydor</hi> all this while had gone on in the ſame Road of an innocent Acquaintance with my Siſter, and as ſhe ever preſerved a good Reſpect for him, now, under her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, ſhe found the Uſe of his Friendſhip. Who could ſo properly condole with her the Loſs of <hi>Caſtalio,</hi> as the Man who had loved him beyond his own Quiet and Happineſs? To whom could ſhe ſo freely communicate her Grief, as to one who knew her Weakneſs, and had long ſince forgiven her the crueleſt Effects of it? Thus, Sir, by mingling their Sorrows, they fell inſenſibly into a Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for each other. His Flame revived with greater Violence than ever, and ſhe on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wonder'd at the Progreſs ſhe had made, before ſhe well knew where ſhe was. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering her ſelf as a Kind of Widow, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to continue ſuch till a Twelvemonth was expired. She did ſo, and having appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt for her Wedding Day, juſt as ſhe was going out, ſhe was met by <hi>Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> at the Door. In the midſt of Joy and Confuſion, ſhe flew to him, and fainted in his Arms. What Meaſures, good Mr. <hi>Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff,</hi> can be taken in this Affair? <hi>Polydor</hi> raves like a Madman, walks the Streets with his Sword drawn, and in caſe he is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, threatens Deſtruction to all about him. <hi>Caſtalio</hi> bewails <hi>Fidelia</hi> and himſelf, commiſerates his Friend, and upbraids his Father that had intercepted his Letters, and purchaſed of ſeveral <hi>Iriſh</hi> Men the Report of his Death: But my Siſter—ſhe alas! is loſt to all Reaſon; and if ſhe were not, the Truth is, I have none to offer upon this
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0397200205:84"/>
Emergency. Inſtruct me, dear Sir, but to mitigate her Afflictions, and you ſhall find me from that Moment a more chearful Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, and upon all Occaſions,</p>

               </floatingText>
               <p>The Caſe of <hi>Fidelia,</hi> as well as that of the Pretenders to her, is indeed very deplorable; and the more ſo, becauſe having carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed the Records belonging to the <hi>Court of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> I cannot from thence inform my ſelf how to proceed, or in whom to veſt the Right of her Perſon. However, if neceſſary, a Special Verdict may be had without much Trouble or Expence. In the mean Time, to ſpeak upon it in an extrajudicial Way, if the Lady happens to be of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſuaſion, I adviſe her to a Nunnery; if not, and ſhe be qualified as her Brother has repreſented, I know a certain old Gentleman who will be well enough pleaſed to take her off with all her Misfortunes and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities about her. By having frequent Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of inſtilling the Precepts of Philoſophy, he may in Time alleviate her Diſquiets; at leaſt under the Protection of ſuch a one, ſhe may; as many others do, enjoy all the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Privacy, without any of the Confinement or Severities of a Monaſtick Retirement.</p>

               <p>THERE is no Conſideration of more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or which more reſpects the preſent or future Good of Mankind, than a ſevere and nice Attention to the natural Bent, Genius or Diſpoſition of Children. 'Tis through a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this, that we ſee ſo many Profeſſions, Functions and Vocations ſo ill executed and ſupplied. I have often preached this to Major <hi>Matchlock,</hi> who himſelf had been an <hi>Oliverian,</hi> and could neither write nor read, and but ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily ſet his Mark. His Conſciouſneſs of his Want of Learning made him run mad upon making his Son a Scholar. The Lad, who had an hereditary and unalienable Dulneſs, was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incapable. Nevertheleſs to the <hi>Charter-Houſe</hi> he went, where after having been for Four Years under a good Diſcipline, he was (if poſſible) more ſtupified by Correction, and returned again, like a leaden Shilling, upon his father's Hands. Soon after, by my Advice, he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0397200205:86"/>
was put to a Banker in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> is now a Common-Councilman, will ſhortly be Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Ward, and may in Time bid fair for the Chair. This is one Inſtance, and every one who reads this, cannot fail, from his own Knowledge, of recollecting many more. On the other Hand, a great Genius is ſometimes overlooked, and a Youth ty'd down to mean Applications by having a Mechanick to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe natural Fire, and Greatneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, make frequent vigorous Attempts; by which he at length ſallies from behind the Counter, breaks through his Indentures, quits his opprobrious Apron, and flouriſhes in Arts or Arms. We read, that <hi>Wolſey</hi> was but the Son of a Butcher, his Servant, the great <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> and who perhaps was as great a Man, the Son of a Blackſmith. An eminent Perſon of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Times was reproached by one of better Birth, though of meaner Parts, for having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been a Carrier. His Anſwer, for his Temper and excellent Judgment in it, is not to be forgotten, which was, <q rend="inline">"That if he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd him had once been a Carrier, he would have been a Carrier ſtill."</q> To deſcend yet to a more modern Inſtance, my Friend <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah Pattern,</hi> by Profeſſion a Saleſman in the <hi>Strand,</hi> who ſold me my laſt Purple Bays Gown, has a Son whom he bound to himſelf, that he might learn to make Clothes; but he, it ſeems, was only born to wear 'em. I cannot ſay that he appears addicted by Nature either to Arts or Arms, being of the Beau Species, and giving daily Indications of a Smart Fellow. The Symptoms broke out early upon him, in red Heels, wrought Clocks, Agate-headed Canes, Liſpings, Patches, Contortions in Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oaths, Shrugs, Smiles, white Gloves, with a perpetual Propenſity of ſtretching out his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0397200205:87"/>
Hand to lead Ladies, not only from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Door, but from Pews, Pit, Box, or Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It was alſo obſervable of him, that when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Emergency he was forced to attend the Shop, he handled his Ell, and unrolled the Callicoes, with a particular Air of Scorn, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and Indignation. What the Cataſtrophe of this Character will be I am loth to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but there ſeems to be ſome preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy in his Stars. His Mother, good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, came to me the other Day with Tears in her Eyes, and told me, that on the 6th of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> laſt he went out, to all Appearance, well in the Morning. He had indeed diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf in a rich Suit, by Means of which he was as much obſerved, as he was unknown, at Court; that he returned very late at Night, extremely diſordered, and has rav'd ever ſince. His Imagination being fill'd with the Idea's of what he ſaw there, he frequently breaks out in Exclamations on Baſſet, Drawing-Room, Balls, Rigadoons, Minuets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He talks of Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſes, Counteſſes, and Yeomen of the Guard. A poor Country Woman call'd in to buy a Yard of Flannel, and he cry'd, Stand by. A Servant Maid came juſt afterwards for a Callicoe Gown and Petticoat: Asking him how much would ſerve, he told her, ſhe muſt take ſo many Yards extraordinary, for he preſumed ſhe would have it with a Train; then offered to lead her to her Pattins, which ſhe had put off at the Door, and wiſh'd her Grace a good Night.</p>
               <p>A Perſon of leſs Penetration than my ſelf, may eaſily ſee to the Bottom of <hi>Ned Pattern</hi>'s Caſe. To ſpeak Poetically, he has, like <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus,</hi> ſtolen Fire from bright Eyes that roll in an Orb too far above him. It is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he knows not the great Lady that has given him the Wound, and utterly impoſſible
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0397200205:88"/>
that from her he ſhould ever obtain any Cure. If he can be informed of her Title and Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would adviſe him to entertain humble Thoughts, to aim at being introduced into the Preſence, and by Degrees into the Favour, of her <hi>Abigail,</hi> the Poſſeſſion of whom, though not as a principal Remedy, may yet as a <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneum</hi> prove effectual to his Recovery; a Method very familiar to us in our Practice of Phyſick: And who knows, but the old Clothes and tarniſhed Habiliments, together with the caſt Airs and Second-hand Simagreex, of the original Beauty, may have a Virtue in them like that ſaid to have been in <hi>Achilles</hi> Spear, the Ruſt of which never failed to heal the Wounds it had made<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>MY Landlady has a little Boy about Five Years old, with whoſe Converſation I often divert my ſelf when I have taken my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon's Nap. I was yeſterday, with my Spectacles on, cutting out for him the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Kings, Milk-Maids, Trees, and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0397200205:90"/>
like, in Paper. We happen'd to be in warm Debate upon ſome important Circumſtance in our Buſineſs, when <hi>Will Moody</hi> came into my Room, and ſeemed to wonder how a Perſon of my Age and Gravity could deſcend to ſuch Trifles. He made me ſo tedious a Viſit, and was ſo very diſagreeable in it, that I long'd till he was gone, and young Maſter and my ſelf had reſumed our Entertainment, having a King to finiſh, who wanted only his Crown and a Pair of Hands. I have ſince reflected with ſome Contempt on thoſe who think that Wiſdom conſiſts in a conſtant Tenor of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and that they can never put off their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs without breaking into their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. How ill Judges ſuch People are of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature may be determined, not only from the Opinions of Poets and Philoſophers, but from the Practice of the wiſeſt and greateſt Men. <hi>Socrates,</hi> who, I think, may be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the firſt Rank of Mankind, was at Fourſcore taken by ſome of his Scholars in the Fact, Whiſtling and Dancing by himſelf. <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> uſed to amuſe themſelves with ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Shells on the Sea-Shore, and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to play at Cobnut with ſome favourite Boys.</p>
               <p>As all Exerciſe, whether of Body or Mind, requires ſome Relaxation, ſo we may obſerve a Sort of Analogy or Agreement between Men's ſeveral Employments, and the Amuſements they fall into. Thus the Labourer, after the Toil of the Day, refreſhes himſelf in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Wreſtling, Dancing, or flinging the Bar: The dull Plodders in Buſineſs, as ſoon as they are diſingaged from it, fall inſenſibly aſleep, or doze over a Pint: Men of great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius naturally fall into theſe Trifles which, at the ſame Time that they give Eaſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to the Faculties, ſerve to enliven in ſome
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0397200205:91"/>
Degree, and keep them in a gentle Motion. This I take to have been the Eaſe of thoſe great Men whoſe Examples I have produced; and I am ſo far gone in this Opinion, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every Perſon underſtands the Art of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling agreeably, in Proportion to his Share of Wit and good Senſe; thoſe who are defective in either, being as incapable of doing it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as of reliſhing it in others. The only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience is, when Men in great or grave Stations are not cautious enough to diſtinguiſh before whom they give themſelves a Liberty this Way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Will Moody,</hi> amongſt many others, has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me with this Obſervation. After much formal Advice againſt doing Things unſuitable to my Age, and telling me how much it would have reflected upon me if any but a Friend had come in, he added, That he was mightily ſhocked ſome Time ago by a Perſon of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for Learning and Virtue, that had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him for half an Hour together with the Particularities of a Puppet-Show, which he carried his little Grandſon to ſee the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Truth is, ſuch ſow and groveling Spirits as theſe have ſome Reaſon for their Cenſure, who poſſeſſing no good Qualities able to gain or to raiſe Eſteem, ſhould not preſume to act a Part that would ſerve only to make 'em ridiculous. A Man who hopes to eſtabliſh his Character and Fortune by the Solemnity of his Countenance, would be in the Wrong to part with it upon every ſlight Occaſion. Should he once deviate from the Road he is in, he knows not where it might end, nor how to recover his Miſtake. Even a Smile might be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequence, and therefore he arms himſelf with an impregnable Gravity againſt all the Fooleries and Gaieties that may happen in his Way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0397200205:92"/>
                  <hi>Democritulus</hi> is equally a Coxcomb, though of a very different Mould. He laughs for Laughing's Sake in the wrong Place, and is a Trifler upon all Occaſions. In Purſuit of this Humour, he regards neither Time, Perſon, nor Circumſtance, but lays about him without Diſtinction, and is a Kind of <hi>Drawcanſir</hi> in Converſation. His neareſt Acquaintance, and their tendereſt Concerns, are the Subjects of his Wit and Ridicule; and he ſeems to value himſelf for nothing more, than for having got the better of Modeſty, good Manners, and Humanity. How an Inclination to Raillery may betray one into Offences of this Kind, I muſt produce my ſelf as an Inſtance; and as the following Letter has awakened in me a Senſe of my Error, my Willingneſs to inſert it here, will, I hope, in ſome Meaſure atone for it.</p>

               <p>THE Relation between Maſters and their Servants, would, if rightly improved, contribute a great deal to the Happineſs of both. <hi>Seneca</hi> places the latter in a lower Rank of Friends, and imputes the vile and abject Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they uſually meet with, to the Pride or Ignorance of thoſe who have the Power in their Hands. For my own Part, I have ever had a Kind of Tenderneſs and Regard for the few I have entertained in my Service: I have at proper Times beſtowed ſuitable Advice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and to the beſt of my Power impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both their Morals and Underſtanding. By this Means they have gradually commenced
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0397200205:95"/>
humble Companions, and ſerved to amuſe me with a Kind of low Converſation, at the ſame Time that they were doing the little neceſſary Offices about my Perſon. My Maid, who is now turned of Fifty, is of ſingular Uſe in this Way: As ſhe is warming my Bed, ſhe tells me a Hundred Stories of Spirits without Heads, black Dogs, and ſeveral Kinds of Apparitions, that have for <hi>ſarten</hi> been ſeen in the Pariſh where ſhe was born. In a Morning, when ſhe brings me my Candle, ſhe acquaints me how the World goes, and entertains me with her ſimple Remarks on the moſt conſiderable Men, and moſt important Affairs in it. This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the moſt of her Capacity: But <hi>Pacolet,</hi> my other Servant, was a much greater Genius, and adorn'd with many excellent Qualities the high Station of <hi>Premiere Miniſtre</hi> to the Cenſor of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Publick has been frequently obliged to his Intelligence for the Detection of ſeveral ſecret Enormities, I cannot think it improper to give ſome Account of him here, of his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence for Six Months paſt, and his late Return to theſe Parts. About the latter End of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> laſt he came to me, and after talking over ſome Affairs I had employed him in, he told me in ſhort, he was grown weary of acting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together within the narrow Limits of this Kingdom, that if I would pleaſe to allow him a Salary, and ſend him abroad with a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, he would in a ſhort Time viſit all the Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and bring from thence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Secrets and Curioſities worthy of my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Acceptance.

Time took my ſeveral Degrees in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At firſt ſetting out, it was my conſtant Rule to pay a Deference to as many as had any Pretence to it, to ſmile modeſtly when they were pleaſed to be facetious, and often ſtand their Raillery, without offering to return it. It was not without ſome Difficulty that I got this Maſtery of my ſelf, in Spight of which, towards the latter End of an Evening, I now and then made an imprudent Sally, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be as ſprightly as my Betters; but as it happened, I never ſaid a good Thing over Night that was invidiouſly remember'd the next Morning: The Truth is, the Smallneſs of my Fortune laid ſome Reſtraint upon my Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. I ſeldom rightly enjoyed my ſelf till the Reckoning was paid, and by this Means my Gaiety begun when that of other People was at an End. At length, by an habitual Dulneſs, and other innocent Arts in my Behaviour, I worked my ſelf into the Eſteem of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and in ſomething more than four Years was allowed to be one of the Company. Then it was that I began to exert my Talents, and by aſſuming every Day more and more, at length eſtabliſhed an indiſputable Authority in the World. Though the Impatience and Fire of Youth may ſuggeſt otherwiſe, theſe are certainly the Steps that lead ſafely to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Greatneſs, in whatever Form or Profeſſion we aſpire after it.</p>
               <p>I am indeed of Opinion, that ſome Years of our Lives are in a Manner thrown away and loſt by Means of a wrong Education; which nothing has more effectually convinced me of, than the great and early Improvements that my Friend <hi>Sam Truſty</hi>'s Nephew, mentioned in one of my former Papers, has made under the particular Care and Direction of his Uncle:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0397200205:102"/>
But till the ſame Method can be brought into general Practice, we muſt e'en take the World as we find it; we muſt ſubmit to the Rules univerſally received, and inſtead of weighing our own Merits abſtractedly, conſider them as they are placed in Relation to, and Dependance upon, thoſe about us. Amongſt other Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary to be obſerved in Life, there is one which, for the Benefit of thoſe who come Strangers to this City, I cannot but take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; that of Coffee-houſes I mean, the Violation of which may otherwiſe lead them into many Inconveniencies and Indecorums.

               <p>THoſe inferior Duties of Life which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>les petite Morale,</hi> or the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Morals, are with us diſtinguiſhed by the Name of good Manners or Breeding. This I look upon, in the general Notion of it, to be a Sort of artificial good Senſe, adapted to the meaneſt Capacities, and introduced to make Mankind eaſy in their Commerce with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Low and little Underſtandings, without ſome Rules of this Kind, would be perpetually wandring into a Thouſand Indecencies and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities in Behaviour, and in their ordinary Converſation fall into the ſame boiſterous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities that one obſerves amongſt them when a Debauch has quite taken away the Uſe of their Reaſon. In other Inſtances it is odd to conſider, that for Want of common Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the very End of good Breeding is wholly perverted, and Civility, intended to make us eaſy, is employed in laying Chains and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon us, in debarring us of our Wiſhes,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0397200205:106"/>
and in croſſing our moſt reaſonable Deſires and Inclinations. This Abuſe reigns chiefly in the Country, as I found to my Vexation, when I was laſt there, in a Viſit I made to a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour about Two Miles from my Couſin. As ſoon as I enter'd the Parlour, they forced me into the great Chair that ſtood cloſe by a huge Fire, and kept me there by Force till I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtifled. Then a Boy came in great Hurry to pull off my Boots, which I in vain oppoſed, urging that I muſt return ſoon after Dinner. In the mean Time the good Lady whiſpered her eldeſt Daughter, and ſlipped a Key into her Hand. She returned inſtantly with a Beer Glaſs half full of <hi>Aqua Mirabilis</hi> and Syrrup of Gillyflowers. I took as much as I had a Mind for, but Madam vowed I ſhould drink it off, (for ſhe was ſure it would do me Good after coming out of the cold Air) and I was forced to obey, which abſolutely took away my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. When Dinner came in, I had a Mind to ſit at a Diſtance from the Fire; but they told me, it was as much as my Life was worth, and ſet me with my Back juſt againſt it. Tho' my Appetite was quite gone, I reſolved to force down as much as I could, and deſired the Leg of a Pullet. Indeed, Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> ſays the Lady, you muſt eat a Wing to oblige me, and ſo put a Couple upon my Plate. I was perſecuted at this Rate during the whole Meal. As often as I called for Small Beer, the Maſter tipped the Wink, and the Servant brought me a Brimmer of <hi>October.</hi> Some Time after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ordered my Couſin's Man who came with me to get ready the Horſes; but it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved I ſhould not ſtir that Night; and when I ſeemed pretty much bent upon going, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Stable Door to be locked, and the Children hid away my Cloak and Boots.

As ſoon as her Back was turned, the little Miſſes ran backwards and forwards every Moment, and conſtantly as they came in or went out, made a Courtefie directly at me, which in good Manners I was forced to return with a Bow, and, <hi>Your humble Servant pretty Miſs.</hi> Exactly at Eight the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came up, and diſcovered by the Redneſs of her Face that Supper was not far off. It was twice as large as the Dinner, and my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution doubled in Proportion. I deſired at my uſual Hour to go to my Repoſe, and was conducted to my Chamber by the Gentleman, his Lady, and the whole Train of Children. They importuned me to drink ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went to Bed, and upon my refuſing, at laſt left a Bottle of <hi>Stingo,</hi> as they called it, for Fear I ſhould wake and be thirſty in the Night. I was forced in the Morning to riſe and dreſs my ſelf in the Dark, becauſe they would not ſuffer my Kinſman's Servant to diſturb me at the Hour I had deſired to be called. I was now reſolved to break through all Meaſures to get away, and after ſitting down to a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Breakfaſt of cold Beef, Mutton, Neats Tongues, Veniſon Paſty, and Stale Beer, took Leave of the Family; but the Gentleman would
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0397200205:108"/>
needs ſee me Part of my Way, and carry me a ſhort Cut through his own Grounds, which, he told me, would ſave half a Mile's Riding. This laſt Piece of Civility had like to have coſt me dear, being once or twice in Danger of my Neck, by leaping over his Ditches, and at laſt forced to alight in the Dirt, when my Horſe, having ſlip'd his Bridle, ran away, and took us up more than an Hour to recover him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>It is evident that none of the Abſurdities I met with in this Viſit proceeded from an ill Intention, but from a wrong Judgment of Complaiſance, and a Miſapplication of the Rules of it. I cannot ſo eaſily excuſe the more refined Criticks upon Behaviour, who having profeſſed no other Study, are yet infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the moſt material Parts of it. <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

He viſits moſt of the fine Women near St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſays the civileſt and ſofteſt Things to them of any Man breathing. To Mr. <hi>Iſaac</hi> he owes an eaſie Slide in his Bow, and a graceful Manner of coming into a Room. But in ſome other Caſes he is very far from being a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Perſon: He laughs at Men of far ſuperior Underſtanding to his own, for not being as well dreſſed as himſelf, deſpiſes all his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that are not Quality, and in publick Places has on that Account often avoided ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Notice of ſome of the beſt Speakers in the Houſe of Commons. He rails ſtrenuouſly at both Univerſities before the Members of either, and never is heard to ſwear an Oath, or break in upon Morality or Religion, but in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Divines. On the other Hand, a Man of right Senſe has all the Eſſentials of good
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0397200205:109"/>
Breeding, though he may be wanting in the Forms of it. <hi>Horatio</hi> has ſpent moſt of his Time at <hi>Oxford.</hi> He has a great deal of Learning, an agreeable Wit, and as much Modeſty as ſerves to adorn without concealing his other good Qualities.

Hence it is, that he gives no Offence, that he converſes with great Deference, Candor, and Humanity. His Bow, I muſt confeſs, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what aukward; but then he has an extenſive, univerſal, and unaffected Knowledge, which makes ſome Amends for it. He would make no extraordinary Figure at a Ball; but I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Ladies in his Behalf, and for their own Conſolation, that he has writ better Verſes on the Sex than any Man now living, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring ſuch a Poem for the Preſs as will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Praiſes and his own to many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <p>THE Concern I have for the Errors of Mankind in general, does ſenſibly abate or increaſe in Proportion to the Rank and Quality of thoſe who fall under my Obſervation. For this Reaſon I can never ſuffer a Coronet to paſs me without enquiring whom it belongs to, and whether it be worn in a Manner ſuitable to ſo honourable a Diſtinction. I can ſay with a great deal of Truth, that I am commonly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to my Satisfaction: When it happens otherwiſe, I carry my Enquiry yet further, and inform my ſelf with the greateſt Exactneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, whether the Misfortune of Complexion, or that of Education, has chiefly contributed to eclipſe the Luſtre, and defeat the Advantages, of a high and noble Deſcent. Many Failures I find chargeable on the former, but they are not ſo numerous, nor of ſo dangerous a Nature, as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0397200205:111"/>
thoſe which reſult from the latter, being only ſuch Tendencies of the Mind as, by early Care and proper Application, might have been culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and improved into uſeful and generous Qualifications. It is therefore of the laſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as well to the future Happineſs of our young Nobility, as to that of a Nation in great Meaſure depending on them; that their Genius ſhould be nicely obſerved, their Capacity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and a right Turn given to their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. To effect this, I have ſometimes had it in my Head to write a Treatiſe with Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to Tutors or Governors in the Diſcharge of ſo weighty an Employment; but being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed that they were a Sort of People who had little Opinion of any Body's Wiſdom but their own, I was diſcouraged from that Undertaking, and obliged to purſue other Meaſures. I have within this Twelvemonth made a Coffee-houſe Acquaintance with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as I could, and now and then over a Diſh of Tea enquired into the Schemes and Methods they have laid down for the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Pupils. The firſt I happened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a grave, ſober, and diſcreet Perſon, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Fifty, his Countenance ſomewhat formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and his Converſation extremely rigid and ſevere. He has by ſome Means or other ſeen the Outſides of moſt of the Courts in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and got a Smattering in the Languages; but having no Taſte of polite Learning, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſight into humane Nature, he is much better qualified to wait in an Ante-room, or keep the Accounts of the Family he belongs to, than to conduct the Hopes of it into the World. He has often told me with great Pride and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, <q rend="inline">"That he has his young Lord in as much Subjection as a Footboy, That he of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0397200205:112"/>
Courſe denies him every Thing he has a Mind to, and that in the Midſt of his Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he can make him tremble with a Frown."</q> Such is the Love of Tyranny in mean and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Spirits, even in the loweſt Circumſtance of Power. Another of them ſets up for a fine Gentleman, and is a Pedant in taking Pains to be otherwiſe. He has a Notion that Letters are but a poor Accompliſhment for a Man of Quality, that a good Air, and being furiouſly of a Party, are ſufficient Diſtinctions for one that is born to many others; and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges the Youth under his Care in an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Love of Dogs, Horſes, Plays, Gallantry, and all Manner of Entertainments. At Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Hours he flatters him with an Opinion of his Superiority to the common Level of Mankind, and ſtrictly cautions him againſt entertaining the leaſt Regard for the Scum and Dregs of the People. What a Patriot, Hero, and Counſellor, may we hope for from ſo extraordinary an Education! A Third, whom I ſuffer indeed to viſit me now and then, ſeems to have a better Senſe of his Duty in this Station than either of the others. Knowing that I am a great Lover of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he one Day brought his Pupil, who is very young, to my Lodgings. He had long promiſed him, I found, that he would carry him to wait upon Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff;</hi> and I do not remember, that I was ever ſo well pleaſed with being pointed at in Publick, as I was with the particular Survey this little Boy took of me. After this Curioſity was pretty well over, he ſeemed willing to enter into Converſation, in which he acquitted himſelf with the utmoſt good Manners, and a manly Turn of Wit very diſproportioned to his Years. I could perceive
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0397200205:113"/>
he had a great Mind to be talking of the <hi>Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> and I on Purpoſe led him into it. He made ſome very ſurpriſing Remarks upon ſeveral of them, and with an agreeable Freedom ask'd me the Meaning of others that he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. I begged his little Lordſhip to accept of the Volumes I had by me, and in Return he deſired my Leave to be a Subſcriber for the next. Ever now and then I had my Eye upon his Tutor, and could perceive in him an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Pleaſure for the good Behaviour of his Charge.</p>
               <p>I could not help taking him aſide ſoon after, and telling him, that I almoſt envy'd him the Happineſs of having ſo fine a Genius in his Hands: <q rend="inline">"Go on Sir, ſays I, to cultivate and improve it, and by that Means be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of publick Good to your Country. You will never, perhaps, have it in your Power to act in a more meritorious Capacity. Think only what a Pleaſure it will be to you, to ſee this young Gentleman hereafter at the Head of an Army, or managing a Debate in the moſt illuſtrious Aſſembly in the World. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, you will in a great Meaſure partake his Glory, and act as it were by Proxy in whatever Station his Merit ſhall advance him to If I can form any Judgment of him at theſe Years, you will from his future Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Eſteem receive the Fruits of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Pains you can beſtow upon him. He will conſider you almoſt in the higheſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and next to the Perſons that gave him Life, will love and honour one that pointed out to him the Uſe and End of his Being.'</q>

But I was very much ſurprized when, upon his coming to me again in the Evening. I found he had not received the Satisfaction we both expected from the Aſſiſtance of ſo celebrated a Phyſician. <q rend="inline">'<hi>Mr.</hi> Bickerſtaff, (ſaid he to me with a deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Countenance) I have been to ſee my old Friend <hi>Aeſculapius.</hi> I found with him a young Man whom I took at firſt to have been a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; for he looked ſadly. At his going out, I heard the Doctor ſay, <hi>Either forbear to uſe thoſe Powders, or ſee my Face no more. Ah! old Friend, ſaid he, upon Sight of me, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Boy will certainly undo me. Have I walked up ſo many Pair of Stairs to get a little Money together, to have this young Fellow ſpend it at Twopence a Day for Powder for his Hair? Come ſit down, let me know what it is brings you to Town.</hi> I told him my Caſe in as few Words as I could, to which he anſwered with a melancholy Look, <hi>That he was not at all ſurpriſed at it, ſince he was but too ſenſible of his having formerly been a Football himſelf;</hi> and to let me know what ſtrange Impreſſions the Mind of Man is capable of, he aſſured me, <hi>That a certain Gentleman in this Town me long ago took his Face for a Spitting Pot.</hi> I was no leſs ſtartled at what he ſaid, than at what I afterwards obſerved. We were no ſooner ſeated, but looking on his Watch, he ſtarted up again, and cried, <hi>Adſo! we muſt think of Dinner:</hi> Then ſtepping into the next Room, he fetched from thence a String.

faſten'd one End of it to a Nail over his Chimney, he tied a Leg of Mutton to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and giving it a Twirl, began a long Complaint of the melancholy Circumſtances he found himſelf in. He told me, <hi>Every Body thought him vaſtly rich, but they did not know what the Expences of Life were.</hi> Then giving his Mutton another Twirl, <hi>'Tis true,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have Fourſcore Thouſand Pounds in the Funds; but if a Man did not take Care to dreſs hit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Dinner, he might be poiſoned for all that.</hi> So deſiring me to reach him the Flower-Box, <hi>Doctor,</hi> ſays he, <hi>What do you think gilding a Chariot might ſtand me in?</hi> Sir, ſaid I, What need you trouble your ſelf about that? All the World knows—<hi>All the World may know what they pleaſe,</hi> replied he, <hi>but you will ſee me want before I die. However,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I think it would do no Harm if we had a Dripping-pan now; Pray give the Box a ſhake, Doctor, whilſt I ſtep and fetch it. You muſt not take it ill that I put you upon theſe Offices, there are but few Friends I can truſt to do them for me.</hi> He went on, <hi>Do you love</hi> French <hi>Wine? I believe you may; I did once my ſelf: But let me tell you, That White Port is not only the cheapeſt, but the beſt Wine now about Town.</hi> Here I interrupted him, and deſired he would think a little of my Caſe. <hi>Why, ſuppoſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>you went to the</hi> Bath? <hi>I have been there formerly. Or what if you took a Lodging about</hi> Hammerſmith? <hi>Or elſe met me at</hi> Tom<hi>'s to Morrow?</hi> I perceived it was much the ſame which of the Three I did, or whether I did any of them or no; ſo I e'en took my Leave, and came away. Judge you, Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> whether this Gentleman is able to do any Good, as the Caſe ſtands between him and me.</q>

               <p>THE Dignity and Diſtinction of Men of Wit is ſeldom enough conſidered, either by themſelves or others; their own Behaviour, and the Uſage they meet with, being generally very much of a Piece. I have at this Time in my Hands an Alphabetical Liſt of the <hi>Beaux Eſprits</hi> about this Town, Four or Five of whom have made the proper Uſe of their Genius, by gaining the Eſteem of the beſt and greateſt Men, and by turning it to their own Advantage in ſome Eſtabliſhment of their Fortunes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unequal to their Merit; others ſatisfying themſelves with the Honour of having Acceſs to great Tables, and of being ſubject to the Call of every Man of Quality, who upon Occaſion wants one to ſay witty Things for the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Company. This Treatment never moves my Indignation ſo much as when it is practiſed by a Perſon, who though he owes his

                  </gap> ignominious Terms. I know a certain Lord that has often invited a Set of People, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for their Diverſion a Buffoon Player, and an eminent Poet, to be of the Party; and which was yet worſe, thought them both ſufficiently recompenced by the Dinner, and the Honour of his Company. This Kind of Inſolence is riſen to ſuch a Height, that I my ſelf was the other Day ſent to by a Man with a Title, whom I had never ſeen, deſiring the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that I would dine with him and half a Dozen of his ſelect Friends. I found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the Footman had told my Maid below Stairs, that my Lord having a Mind to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, had reſolved right or wrong to ſend for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Iſaac.</hi> I was ſufficiently provoked with the Meſſage; however I gave the Fellow no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwer, than that <hi>I believed he had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken the Perſon, for I did not remember that his Lord had ever been introduced to me.</hi> I have Reaſon to apprehend that this Abuſe hath been owing rather to a Meanneſs of Spirit in Men of Parts, than to the natural Pride or Ignorance of their Patrons. Young Students coming up to Town from the Places of their Education, are dazzled with the Grandeur they every where meet, and making too much Haſte to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh their Parts, inſtead of waiting to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0397200205:126"/>
and careſſed, are ready to pay their Court at any Rate to a great Man, whoſe Name they have ſeen in a publick Paper, or the Frontiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of a Dedication. It has not always been thus; Wit in polite Ages has ever begot either Eſteem or Fear: The Hopes of being celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or the Dread of being ſtigmatized, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an univerſal Reſpect and Awe for the Perſons of ſuch as were allowed to have the Power of diſtributing Fame or Infamy where they pleaſed. <hi>Aretine</hi> had all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> his Tributaries, and when any of them had committed a Folly that laid them open to his Cenſure, they were forced by ſome Preſent extraordinary to compound for his Silence; of which there is a famous Inſtance on Record. When <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had miſcarried in his <hi>African</hi> Expedition, which was looked upon as the weakeſt Undertaking of that great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he ſent <hi>Aretine</hi> a Gold Chain, who made ſome Difficulty of accepting it, ſaying, <hi>It was too ſmall a Preſent in all Reaſon for ſo great a Folly.</hi> For my own Part, in this Point I differ from him, and never could be prevailed upon, by any valuable Conſideration, to conceal a Fault or a Folly ſince I firſt took the Cenſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon me.</p>
               <p>Having long conſidered with my ſelf the ill Application that ſome make of their Talents, I have this Day erected a Court of <hi>Alienation,</hi> by the Statutes of which the next a Kin is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to <hi>beg</hi> the Parts and Underſtanding of any ſuch Perſon as can be proved, either by imbezelling, making a wrong Uſe, or no Uſe at all of the ſaid Parts and Underſtanding, not to know the true Value thereof: Who ſhall immediately be put out of Poſſeſſion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified for ever; the ſaid Kinſman giving ſufficient Security that he will employ them as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0397200205:127"/>
the Court ſhall direct. I have ſet down under certain Heads the ſeveral Ways by which M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> proſtitute and abuſe their Parts, and from thence have framed a Table of Rules, whereby the Maintiff may be informed when he has a good Title to eject the Defendant. I may in a following Paper give the World ſome Account of the Proceedings of this Court. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready got Two able Criticks for my Aſſeſſors upon the Bench, who, though they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exerciſed their Pens in taking off from the Wit of others, have never pretended to challenge any themſelves, and conſequently are in no Danger of being engaged in making Claims, or of having any Suits commence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Every Writer ſhall be tried by his Peers, throughly vers'd in that Point where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he pretends to excel; for which Reaſon the Jury can never conſiſt of above half the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Number, I ſhall in general be very tender how I put any Perſon out of his Wits; but as the Management of ſuch Poſſeſſions is of great Conſequence to the World, I ſhall hold my ſelf obliged to veſt the Right in ſuch Hands as will anſwer the great Purpoſes they were intended for, and leave the former Proprietors to ſee their Fortune in ſome other Way.</p>

               <p>It is a Cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Weſt-Indians</hi> that border upon <hi>Virginia,</hi> for the Prieſts of the Country to elect a certain Number of the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuleſt young Men, and of the beſt Families, to make the Operation of <hi>Huskanawing</hi> upon. When they have gather'd together Thirty or Forty of 'em they retire with them into the moſt inacceſſible Parts of the Woods, where they build a large Stove, in which they ſweat the young Men. They keep 'em to a very ſtrange Diet, and their Drink is an odd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, and Juices of poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Herbs, which has ſuch an Effect upon them, that they loſe their Hair, their Nails, their Skins, and half of them their Lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Proceſs be half over.

Theſe are their Heroes, theſe their Counſellors, theſe their Ambaſſadors, theſe have the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of all their Publick Affairs, and are maintained at the Publick Charge. I muſt not omit, that 'tis almoſt impoſſible they ſhould, after this Operation, retain any Regard for

               <p>I went on, and having a Curioſity to ſee theſe ſtrange Creatures my Friend had ſpoke of, called in at the Place before-mentioned.

A ſurly-looking Fellow, who ſeemed to be one of thoſe who do not care a Farthing for any Body, ſate oppoſite to me, and fixing his Eyes ſtedfaſtly upon me, threw out Three or Four of his main Principles in a Breath, expecting, as I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, either my Diſlike or Approbation of them. A young Gentleman next him, who, I obſerved, filled his Pipe, and reached the Tobacco-Tongs for him, aſſented with a Smile to what he ſaid, and could not but wonder, <hi>that any Perſon ſhould be ſo propoſterous as to think otherwiſe, or ſo inſipid as to conceal his Thoughts if he did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Calmneſs and invincible Silence with which I received all this Raillery, had like to have brought me into ſome Peril; for in leſs than a Quarter of an Hour the whole Fire-ſide was up in a Paſſion: Upon which I roſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately from my Chair, laid a Couple of Pence without Noiſe upon the Bar, and ſtole out in the ſame State of Neutrality that I came in.

               <p>A Humour ſo abſurd needs not any Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adverſions.

               <p>I muſt not omit mentioning a good whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Buſineſs that I accidentally met with in this Adventure. The Boy of the Coffee-houſe having put one or two of his politick Papers into my Hand, the Title of the <hi>Spectator,</hi> which I had never before ſeen or heard of, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to read it over in ſuch a curſory Manner as that Kind of Writing requires.

The Caſe of <hi>Ned Prattin,</hi> Saleſman, and that of this unfortunate Perfumer, bear ſome Reſemblance; and I have but too much Reaſon to fear will both terminate in the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Circumſtances of <hi>Straw and a dark Room.</hi> Whether it be owing to the great Quantities of Snuff he has taken, or to Pride of Heart from the Encouragement I formerly gave him, it is certain that the latter has not for ſome Time been right in his Mind. His unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Uſage of me when I went laſt into the Country, was the firſt Sally of his Diſtemper,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0397200205:138"/>
which is now broke out into manifeſt Phrenzy. However unwilling I am to expoſe him in ſo publick a Manner, I muſt hereby warn all Perſons whatſoever concerned about him not to truſt a Penknife in his Hands, nor any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument wherewith he may do himſelf or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a Miſchief; that his Maid do every Night take off his Garters, and remove them far out of his Reach; that he be not permitted to drink out of a Glaſs, leſt he ſhould eat it; nor to feed on Fiſh, (although it be <hi>Lent</hi>) leſt he ſhould induſtriouſly choak himſelf with the Bones.</p>
               <p>I would by no Means be miſunderſtood, as if what I here ſay were meant as any Reflection on Mr. <hi>Buckley</hi>'s Paper. Any Gentleman in his Way may inſert ſuch Letters as come firſt to Hand, and I verily believe That I ſpeak of to be <hi>Charles</hi>'s own Writing.

For my own Part, as I obſerve ſome little Glimmering of a Genius in that Writer, I ſhall be very willing to encourage him in his Studies.

               <p>THE Humour of Duelling having lately very much obtained about Town, I have taken more than ordinary Pains to put a Stop to it. To this End, I have been obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear frequently at moſt of the Gaming-houſes, both the Theatres, and at Punch's Opera. At the latter of theſe Entertainments, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my Preſence, there happened one Evening ſome Advances towards a Quarrel, when Punch, with great Reſolution of Body, coming forwards upon the Stage, ask'd the Gentlemen, <hi>If they were not aſhamed to commit ſuch Diſorders before himſelf and the Cenſor of</hi> Great Britain; For which Inſtance of Reſpect, I ſhall ever honour and eſteem that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Player.

                     <p>I Return you Thanks, in the Name of this Univerſity, for your Town Eclogue, which we look upon to be a very extraordinary Piece of Ridicule. I am commiſſioned to tell you at the ſame Time, that thoſe who were your Contemporaries knowing you to have a happy Talent in Poetry, it is expected you ſhould oblige the World oftner in that Way: You ſhall want no Aſſiſtance this Place can afford. I am making a Collection of the beſt Verſes that are ſtirring for your Service.

the Folly it would be to attempt it. From my firſt Conſiderations upon Envy, I am naturally led to reflect upon ſome little ill Offices which have been lately done me.

No matter for that, ſays ſhe, that argues nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here nor there; but if you have a Mind to have your Wages raiſed, I can tell you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of the Matter—Ay, thought I to my ſelf, is that your Buſineſs! ſo, Sir, I was reſolved to take no Notice—So (ſays the to me) but Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> What makes you like to live ſo with an old Man? I am ſure, if your Place had been ſo good a Place as you talk of, Mr. <hi>Lillie</hi> would have hardly come away from your Maſter—Mr. <hi>Lillie,</hi> ſaid I! Laud help your Head, as if my Maſter could not do without Mr. <hi>Lillie;</hi> Mr. <hi>Lillie</hi> is no Rule for me, my Maſter was but too kind to him; and if I had a Mind to have ſerved Mr. <hi>Lillie</hi> a dirty Trick—My Maſter knows him well enough, and if he had not gone away as he did, my Maſter had turned him away the <hi>Thurſday</hi> after—Nay Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> ſays ſhe, if you are in a Paſſion, (and indeed I was as red as the Fire) good Night to you.

               <p>IT is in my Opinion no ſmall Reflection on the Theatrical Entertainments of this Town, that the intermiſſion of them ſhould be looked upon as a Kind of negative Preparation to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the laſt Importance. This amounts to a tacit Acknowledgment that they are, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, calculated for our Diverſion, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to our Improvement; that they amuſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unbend the Minds of an Audience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of filling them with great and noble I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's; and ſerve rather to ſink the Dignity of humane Nature, than to raiſe in us any juſt Sentiments about it. Were it otherwiſe, the Stage would have good Reaſon to remonſtrate againſt ſo peculiar a Mark of Infamy, as that of being denied to the World at the Approach of any Religious Solemnity, and forced by that Means to confeſs an irreconcilable Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pleaſures of the one, and the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the other. Notwithſtanding all this, I confeſs, for my own Part, that I receive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Advantages from going to the Play-houſe ſometimes. There is, beſides the Play it ſelf,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0397200205:162"/>
ſomething in the Circumſtances of ſuch an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, that gives me a new Turn of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and furniſhes me with Obſervations out of the common Road. I have a Pleaſure more than I ever obſerved in any one elſe on that Occaſion, in ſeeing ſo great a Variety of Faces, as well beautiful as others, and in tracing their ſeveral Tempers, Humours and Opinions in their Looks, Air and Behaviour. To ſit Three Hours in a Crowd, is in my Opinion a ſevere Trial of a Man's Underſtanding, and from his Deportment there I can generally form a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his whole Life and Converſation. Amongſt others, I have ever avoided making an Acquaintance with any Perſon of either Sex who talked loud, or laboured by any Means to be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the Audience. My Friend <hi>Sam Truſty</hi> exceeds me in Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He and I commonly ſit together, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Acts entertain our ſelves with read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over as many People as lie within our Kens. He enters not only into their Diſpoſitions, but the minuteſt Circumſtances of their Fortunes, can caſt up their Monthly Accounts, knows how their Rooms are furniſhed, what they eat and drink; and in ſhort, is at firſt Sight of their Perſons let into the Secrets of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Families. In taking a Survey of the Front Boxes, we are from thence furniſhed with many ſerious Speculations, whilſt the more youthful Part of the Company are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining themſelves on the ſame Subject after a very different Manner. We examine coolly and without Danger the Symmetry and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a fine Face; and from the Bloom of a Complexion, are led perhaps into Reflections upon Light and Colours. We were engaged in a Converſation of this Sort ſome Evenings ago at the Opera, when <hi>Sam Truſty</hi> breaking

               <p>I Cannot better ſhew the Concern I have for the <hi>Belles Letters,</hi> than in making ſuch a Proviſion for thoſe who are turned that Way as may beſt conduce to their Proficiency in it. The different Seaſons of the Year are proper for different Sorts of Performances, which I don't remember any of my Fellow-Labourers in Aſtrology to have obſerved in their Yearly Almanacks. This indeed is a very groſs Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and I queſtion not, if Mr. <hi>Partridge</hi> were alive, but he would readily embrace the Hint, and hereafter improve upon it. Suppoſe, for Inſtance, in a Work of this Kind one were to write <hi>Obſervations on</hi> April.<q>

               <p>Subjoining afterwards:<q>This Month alſo lay the Plots of Plays, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Models of Heroick Poems.

               <p>Thoſe concerned in Paſtorals I have elſewhere conſider'd.

               <p>For the Summer Quarter, any one who has unfaſhionable Wares lying dead upon his Hands, as tawdry Panegyricks, or faded Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, which neither pleaſe the preſent, nor hurt the paſt Miniſtry, is adviſed to ſeek out ſome Plantation or Colony of civil <hi>Indians,</hi> where perhaps they may barter them for Ale, Rum, and Tobacco; and if they ſhould fail there, to proceed on a trading Voyage to the <hi>Bath,</hi> where, by altering the Names, without chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subſtance, their Goods will become Lampoons, and undergo a Fate reverſe to that of <hi>Aſa Foetida,</hi> which ſets out a Perfume from <hi>Surat,</hi> and arrives a Stink at <hi>London.</hi> In one Place it is eat for Sawce, and in the other cures Hyſterick Fits.

               <p>As I was meditating in this Way, I fell into a Sort of Enthuſiaſm: I ſeemed to behold a Chariot, that had painted upon the Doors of it a Snake with the Tail in its Mouth, which being the Hieroglyphick of the Year, as well as the Enſign of the Divinity of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, I was at a Loſs what to make of it.

It is my Cuſtom in an Afternoon to ſaunter from one Coffee-houſe to another; and as I was the other Day thus rambling about, a Couple of odd Fellows enter'd the Room where I was; one of them in his own ſhort black Hair, with an uncommon Smartneſs in his Face; the other a thin meagre Perſon, having much Hunger and Diſcontent in his Countenance. Whilſt the former of theſe engaged the Man of the Houſe in a brisk Converſation, the latter, I obſerved, ſlip'd the <hi>Tatler</hi> into his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0397200205:176"/>
Pocket, and drop'd two <hi>Spectators</hi> in the Place of it, in order, as I ſuppoſe, to ſtifle the one, and introduce the other. They immediately afterwards went out, and upon following them in a careleſs Manner to three or four o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſes, I found them putting the ſame Stratagem in Practice. At laſt I laid hold of one of them, and reſolved to bring him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, when giving a ſudden Spring, he broke looſe from me, and with his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice made the beſt of his Way up the next Alley.

But to return to the Plant: It bore the Figure of that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Weed (if it be lawful to call it one) that more than half the World hold in ſo great Eſteem; and my Friend growing leſs ſerious, deſired, that (while I ſmoaked my Pipe) he might take <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Liberty, and let the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Vegetable give its own Hiſtory in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words:</p>
                     <p>Our Extract is of ancienter Date than that of Mankind, flouriſhing in the World before the Days of <hi>Adam.</hi> Our Parents, tho' wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant from each other as Heaven and Earth, yet always kindly concurred in our Generation and Production, raiſing us higher in their Favour than any of our Siſter Plants. As our Birth was for many Ages ſpontaneous, ſo was our Life uncontrouled; and while we ſaw our Neighbours devoured all by Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Brutes, or Men, our ſelves ſecurely ranged the <hi>American</hi> Woods unexpoſed to their voracious Appetites; for as we were Objects of their Love, ſo neither were they of our Fears. How did the Sun each Morn ſmile on us with Paternal Rays, and deck us with its cleareſt Gems, while the Gignatick Trees around (as our Life-Guards) protected us from the Fury of inſulting Winds, and only ſuffered the Fans of gentle <hi>Zephyrs</hi> to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0397200205:178"/>
refreſh us. Thus for long Tracts of Time did each reviving Spring cheriſh our Infant Days, and Summer's Heat mature us, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing all their various Beauties to us, and e'er ill-boding Winter, that mortal Foe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Plants, frowned on us, we in a good old Age retired to endleſs Reſt within our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Boſom.</p>
                     <p>But alas! thoſe happy Times are now no more! For a malicious <hi>Indian</hi> (for what Cauſe we know not) committed (ſome Ages ſince) a grave Anceſtor of ours to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Flames, the Odors of whoſe Death procured us all the Injuries we have ſince received; for we no longer lived or died in Peace, but fell an eaſy and defenceleſs Prey to numberleſs Tortures, invented by the barbarous Nations round, to raviſh from us all our new diſcovered Sweets and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</p>
                     <p>This was not long our Caſe before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of an unknown World came, and inflicted on them as many Deaths as they on us; a juſt Return for their inhumance Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of us poor Innocents! But theſe too proved, alas! as mercileſs as thoſe, and have ever ſince forced us into Life by their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Art and cruel Care, to be untimely torn from our Mother's Breaſt, then left to ſcorch with Thirſt and pine away, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a kind Burial in our Native Soil, tranſported us to far diſtant Regions, where our withered Fleſh ſtripped from our ſhrivel'd Bones, was cut in a Thouſand Pieces by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of a dire Invention.</p>
                     <p>Nor are theſe laſt Complaints unjuſt, for though when plucked from Earth our Vegetation ceaſes, yet do we ſtill retain our Spirits in full Strength, and ſo are never
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0397200205:179"/>
releaſed from Pain till totally conſumed in Flames.</p>
                     <p>To enumerate the Qualities I have been famed for, the Uſage I have met with, and the various, and ſometimes contrary Effects aſcribed to my powerful Operations, would be an endleſs Task; I ſhall inſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only in ſome few.</p>
                     <p>At firſt I was the Priſoner of the meaneſt Sort, confined in greazy Pouches, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them my native Fields and Hedges: But I ſoon got the Eſteem of thoſe who kept me in a nearer, though a ſtronger Priſon, and ſo was introduced to Shops and Taverns. Then the learned Faculty began their curious Searches into my hidden Virtues, and could not long conceal their good Opinion of me, which quickly exalted me to the ſublimeſt Heads, ſo that the Stateſman, Lawyer, and Divine, admitted me to their Cloſets and their Studies; and I have often ſince been the obſtetrical Aſſiſtant of many a teeming Brain. How often have I created a keen Appetite to him that before had none; and, which is ſtranger, as often filled a hungry Belly? Many a Time have I received the Thanks of the Scholar at his Books, the Trader at his Accounts, and the Soldier in the Camp, for the Thoughts I have inſpired, the Compoſedneſs I have occaſioned, and the Refreſhment I have adminiſtred. The Sick have praiſed my Cures, the Healthy my Preventions, the Solitary my Amuſements; and thus have I gratified the greateſt Part of the Male World, but generally been the Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Fair.</p>
                     <p>I was once indeed the private Favourite of a Maiden Lady, but unfortunately diſcovered by her Admirer, by being forgotten to be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0397200205:180"/>
thruſt behind the Hangings; and he, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to brook ſo diſguſtful a Rival, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſmiſs'd his Suit, which produced a Shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between the whole Sex and me in my ancient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>orm ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>But ſince I have been refined by the new Mode of cruſhing me to ſmalleſt Atoms, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being kept Priſoner as before to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in Flames, I have had all the Riches of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> beſtowed in fitting up Apartments for me, and am become the conſtant and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Companion of the moſt celebrated Wits and Beauties. I freely viſit now the Church, the Court, the Manſions of the Great, the Tea-Table, and the Cloſet, and every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of higheſt Quality.</p>
                     <p>Nay, I'm not refuſed the Virgin Bed, but often dwell at Midnight on the ſweeteſt Lips, and wake the chaſteſt Fair with Longings to embrace me. By this new Art I gain a free Admiſſion to the Brain too, and am as it were immortalized by being almoſt mixed with Thought it ſelf. But what I value more than all is, that I am the richeſt Jewel in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Diadem.</p>

               <p>HAving, as I formerly obſerved, paſſed through an infinite Variety of Scenes in humane Life, I cannot better employ the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections I have made upon them, than by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing thoſe in the Paths they ought to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue whoſe Youth and Unexperience would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe betray them into a Thouſand Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0397200205:182"/>
Miſapplication of my Parts and Learning, came to an ignoble End. This is a reigning Misfortune amongſt the Genius's of the preſent Age, but has indeed prevailed much more in ſome foregoing Reigns. It is with the utmoſt Indignation that I ſee many great Capacities proſtituted to the moſt unworthy Purpoſes, and the World in a Manner corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched by Perſons whoſe Talents ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Ornament and Reformation of it. Next to the Want of Morality, I bewail the Narrowneſs of Fortune which too often preſſes Men of a liberal Education, and which perhaps is one Step towards leading them into the former. A young Fellow who is uneaſy in his Circumſtances, is naturally betrayed into thoſe Follies which recommend him to Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and give him Hopes of making an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that may one Time or other turn to his Advantage. With this View he gives into many Fooleries that he ſecretly deſpiſes, and at laſt is harden'd into Vices which he former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorred. The Students of both Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are on this Account in a peculiar Manner the Objects of my Care and Concern. As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I ſee a new Face about Town, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes much good Underſtanding, and a lively Imagination, I conclude it came up by the laſt Coach from <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge.</hi> I am im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the Rack to conſider the many Difficulties ſuch a one muſt encounter, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance he muſt pay to inſolent Greatneſs, the frequent Shocks he will receive from the Promotion of inferior Merit, from the Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſome, and the Envy of others; and at laſt, from the mean Reward he is likely to meet with for a long Courſe of Slavery and Dependance.</p>

                     <p>IF the Diſtreſſes of Mankind do really fit ſo near you as we are given to underſtand by your Paper of the 27th of the laſt Month, I have but too juſt a Right to your Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the moſt tender Advice you can beſtow upon me.</p>
                     <p>It was not long ſince my good Fortune to be a Member of — College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where I ſpent Four Years in a Manner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly innocent and agreeable to my Temper. Good Part of my Time was ſpent in Reading, the reſt in ſuch Amuſements as the Place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded. I was generally well eſteemed by the few I was known to, and being not much turned to Gallantry, made a Shift to be eaſy without the Company of Ladies, which, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body knows, are ſcarce in thoſe Parts. During this Retirement, I happened to write a Copy of Verſes which alarmed Two or Three of the Top Bookſellers in this Town, and gave them Hopes of me for a future Author of ſome more conſiderable Work. Whether they employed my Acquaintance to flatter me on that Occaſion I know not, but, to my utter Ruin, I received incredible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe for my Performance. Soon after, I took it in my Head that the Univerſity was too narrow a Sphere for me to act in. I
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0397200205:184"/>
formed to my ſelf great Notions of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation at <hi>London,</hi> and thought it would be taken amiſs, if I did not go and viſit my Friends and Admirers there. I made a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney accordingly, and had the Honour to be introduced to ſome Perſons of a conſiderable Figure. Now, thought I, my Fortune is made; I have ſeen the greateſt General, and the beſt Poet in <hi>Europe.</hi> My old Friends in the mean Time whom I had left behind me, ſent frequent Letters of Congratulation upon the Proſpect I had of coming into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which I received, and anſwered with the Air and Style of one that was already in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. I affected, for Inſtance, a new Way of writing my Name, of making up my Paper, and of ſubſcribing my ſelf according to the Forms received in the Offices about <hi>Whitehall.</hi> The great Civility and good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of many whom I was preſented to, had like to have led me into ſome Miſtake: Through my great Ignorance, and Want of Breeding, I believed every Word they ſaid to me; and when they aſſured me, <hi>they would do me any Service that lay in their Power, that they had a great Opinion of my Merit, and only wanted an Opportunity to ſhew it;</hi> I had no more Complaiſance than to take them at their Words, and look out for Occaſions of trying their Friendſhip. In the mean while my ſlender Fortune run out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace; the Spleen ſucceeded, and I am now, in every Eſſential, as errant a Wit as any about Town. Words cannot expreſs the Shame, Scorn, and Regret I have for my paſt Indiſcretion, which I can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe atone for than by laying it open in this Way for the Good of others, and applying at the ſame Time for Advice to Mr. <hi>Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff</hi>

               <p>IN taking a Survey of Mankind, one cannot but obſerve an univerſal Purſuit of what they call Pleaſure, and at the ſame Time the groſſeſt Miſtakes about the Notion of it. Not to enter into more Particulars, let it ſuffice, that in the Catalogue of Things conducing to this End, Friendſhip is generally omitted, and either not at all conſidered, or elſe exploded and laughed out of Countenance. The Truth is, our Vanity ſeems to have got the better of our Reaſon, and chooſe rather to appear happy than be ſo. Hence it is, that inſtead of cultivating an Intimacy with a few, we make a ſuperficial Acquaintance with all that offer, and are more deſirous of being ſeen by a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, than rightly known and underſtood by any.

                  <hi>Sam Truſty,</hi> whom I have often mentioned in theſe Papers, was almoſt my firſt Choice, and has preſerved me from many Errors which Youth and Indiſcretion would otherwiſe have led me into. I am infinitely obliged to my Couſin <hi>Humphry Wagſtaff</hi> on the ſame Account, as well as for the great Aſſiſtance he has given me in the Proſecution of this Work. My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with each of theſe Gentlemen is a Kind of elegant Retirement from the World, as it furniſhes me with the juſteſt Remarks upon the ſeveral Occurrences in it. Our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents are communicated without Reſerve, inſomuch that our ordinary Diſcourſe is by the latter ſtiled Thinking aloud. In this happy Situation of Life we ſtand leſs expoſed than others commonly are, either to the Strokes of Fortune, the Ill-nature of our Enemies, or any Calamity that can befal us. In the mean Time all our Enjoyments, by being ſhared amongſt us, are heightened and improved in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Pleaſure that every Individual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from them.</p>
               <p>In order to make Mankind happy in the Reliſh of ſo refined a Commerce with each other, I could wiſh our preſent Writers of Plays, inſtead of filling their Works of that Sort with the Buſineſs of Love, would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diverſify them with the Diſtreſs of Friends, their Heroick Behaviour under it, with all the beautiful Incidents that Hiſtory can furniſh, or a warm and noble Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuggeſt upon that Model. I am ſenſible how great a Genius is required to this Task; but whenever the Prudence of our Superiors ſhall think fit to deliver the Stage from the State of Slavery and Miſmanagement it now labours under, I ſhall not deſpair of ſeeing

                     <p>I Came hither about a Week ſince, being forced from <hi>London,</hi> where I ſpent the Winter, by the Commands of my Mother, who took it in her Head that I grew too fond of that Place, and was in Danger of throwing my ſelf away upon ſome idle young Fellow or other. It is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed how melancholy I am here: My Heart akes at this Inſtant as if it would break; I look upon no one Object with Pleaſure. The Fellows whom I liked well enough Half a Year ago, appear ſilly and aukward, and even the Cathedral Church, of a <hi>Sunday,</hi> affords me no Entertainment.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0397200205:196"/>
What ſhall I do, dear Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Heavineſs that ſits upon my Heart? How ſhall I divert my ſelf in this wild and ſolitary Retreat? Formerly indeed I could ſpend whole Days and Nights in turning over my Romances; I could with infinite Pleaſure rove about the Wilderneſs, in our Garden, and charm the Rival Nightingales with the Muſick of my Flute. How often have I there unbound my Silver Locks, and given them to be the Sport of wanton <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrs?</hi> Young ruddy Damſels waited round me, and decking me forth with all the Pride and Beauty of the Spring, proclaimed me Goddeſs of the Place—Oh curſed <hi>Damon</hi>—That dear diſſembling Youth! He, alas! has robbed me of my Innocence, and with it, of all the pleaſing Errors that made Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude delightful, and gilded over theſe Silvan Scenes—</p>
                     <p>He in ſhort, Sir, has turned my Notions another Way, and given me a new Set of Deſires and Inclinations. If you will beſtow ſome Advice upon me, I will endeavour to follow it, and give you a conſtant Account of the Succeſs it has with me. If I at all underſtand my own Caſe, I am by my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances very well qualified for a Rural Cenſor, and can ſee no Reaſon why Women ſhould be excluded that Office. I promiſe you to have a very ſtrict Eye upon my own Sex, and may perhaps let you into ſome Secrets relating to them that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto eſcaped your Cenſure. The faithful Execution of this Employment will be a Means to divert my own Spleen, and may perhaps conduce to the Gratification of yours, and that of many Thouſands more. I will in all Things act as becomes the Subſtitute of

               <p>The Caſe of <hi>Belinda</hi> is in my Opinion very deplorable, and would, if fully conſidered, give Occaſion to many uſeful Reflections. At preſent I ſhall only obſerve upon it, that the Blemiſh ſhe has received in her own Character is by no Means a Step towards a Power and Juriſdiction over the Conduct of others. I am not unwilling to admit ſome of the Fair Sex into the Employment ſhe ſollicits for, having in general a great Opinion of their Capacities, as well as of their earneſt Deſire to reform the Manners of thoſe about them. It may not however be amiſs to give the Electors in this Point a ſhort Abſtract of the Qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to a Female Cenſor, leſt any Miſtakes ſhould happen upon ſo weighty an Affair: As firſt, That ſhe is indeed with an habitual Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; Secondly, That ſhe has a known Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to Scandal and Detraction; Thirdly, That ſhe neither pays nor receives any impertinent Viſits; Fourthly, That ſhe is a conſtant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Tatler;</hi> And Fifthly and Laſtly, That ſhe has, beſides other Books, a huge <hi>

               <p>ONE great Deſign of this Paper is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Men to their ſeveral Stations in Life, and to remove that Uneaſineſs which commonly ariſes from the ſuppoſed Advantages of thoſe about them. Unleſs this be in ſome Meaſure effected, it is in vain to expect any great Succeſs from Precepts of another Kind; a Perſon who is out of Humour being as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of receiving Advice as beſtowing it on others. The Stake chiefly contended for is Power, and this, if I miſtake not, is more equally divided than we commonly imagine. The executive Part of it ſeems indeed to be pretty much engroſs'd by Men of great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and large Poſſeſſions. They, 'tis true, carry about them all the Diſtinctions of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Superiority, they are attended by Maces, adorned with Ribands, and crowded by a numerous Train of Dependants. In the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0397200205:201"/>

He will by this Means diſcover that theſe great Machines are informed, turned and directed by the moſt minute Springs and Movements; that in many Inſtances, a menial Servant has the Management of their higheſt Concerns, and diſpoſes of their Actions as he in his great Wiſdom ſhall judge moſt convenient for them.</p>
               <p>As my Couſin <hi>Humphrey</hi> and my ſelf were taking a Walk in the <hi>Park</hi> the other Day, a Perſon of Note paſſed by us with an Air of Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Contempt, attended by a very mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Equipage. He, with his uſual Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, taking me aſide, deſired me to obſerve that fine Thing, and to give my Opinion of him. Obſerving me a little reſerved upon the Matter, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Iſaac</hi> (ſays he) with ſome Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, You are the greateſt Coward in the World: Had I put the ſame Queſtion to you upon Fifty others of Five hundred Times the Worth of inferior Rank, you would have made no Scruple of ſpeaking your Sentiments. I will tell you then; That Gentleman you ſee there, is one Way or other in Subjection to every one of thoſe Fellows that dangle after him. I happen (continued he) to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted in his Family, in which there is a Chain of Intereſts carried on after the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Manner: The Steward, who is an old Servant, and has cheated his Maſter Time out of Mind, has the entire Government of him. The Houſekeeper has a Hank, as they call it, over the Steward, and makes ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Uſe of him in all impertinent Affairs.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0397200205:202"/>
The Page has no leſs Intereſt in the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, at the ſame Time that he is himſelf in Love with the Chambermaid. <hi>Roſe,</hi> for that is her Name, profeſſes a Paſſion for <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> the Footman, who is deeply ſmitten with dirty <hi>Moll</hi> the Kitchen Wench.

               </p>
               <p>Having but little Knowledge of great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, I was not before aware that this Scheme of Government was received amongſt them; but in the Compaſs of my own Acquaintance I have ſeldom ſeen it otherwiſe. Old Major <hi>Matchlock,</hi> I remember, was a very bluſtering Fellow over a Bottle, and withal made a good terrible Figure at the Head of a Company; but within his own Doors he behaved himſelf with great Puſillanimity, and paid the utmoſt Subjection to an ancient Maid, whom in leſs than Forty Years he had raiſed from raking in a Heap of Cinders, to the Superintendancy over all his domeſtick Affairs. I am not in my own Nature much addicted to Fear, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but confeſs that I ſtand in Awe of my old Servant <hi>Mary.</hi> She happens to be of a mild Diſpoſition, which makes her Authority fit the more eaſy upon me; but if it were otherwiſe, I do not preſume that I ſhould have Courage enough to make Head againſt her. As ſhe has few other Favourites or Companions than my Dog and tabby Cat, there is no Danger of her leading me into any Abſurdities on their Behalf.</p>

               <p>THere is nothing more ſhocking to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Mind, than to ſee his Labours ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered vain and fruitleſs.

Your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the different Characters of Men by the Inſtruments of Harmony, has given moſt an Inclination to be muſical; each pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and hoping to appear in a better Claſs. This innocent Ambition has had an Effect even on the loweſt Kind, and I have known ſome Drums, deſpairing of ever getting a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Note, content to be ſilent; a great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Bleſſing to thoſe unhappy Gentlemen who were ſometimes condemned to be Part of their Audience! But, Sir, there is Need of a farther Reformation, there are ſome People who have formed to themſelves a Sound that comes under no Denomination you have yet imparted to the World; indeed there are not many of this Sect, nor ſhould I
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0397200205:207"/>
take any Notice of them, but that I have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately obſerved they begin to get Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. Theſe noiſy Men have their Fits come upon them very conſtantly, and with very little Intermiſſion, yet they can be ſometimes articulate; but then I don't obſerve thoſe Tokens of Mirth which they ſhow at the End of the Paroxiſm. I have ſeen one of them jump out of his Chair, and ſuddenly getting his Legs from the Ground five or ſix Times, make ſuch a Noiſe as Nature gave us not Ears to receive, which has ended in about Seven Minutes in a ſtrong loud Laugh, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the reſt of the Sect, if there be any preſent, (for the Fit often takes 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Strangers) who join in the Chorus. I have ſeen your great Maſters of Noiſe, Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hunters, Bombardiers, Gunners of all Kinds, Sailers, who are Judges of Storms, amazed at their prodigious Vociferation. I ſhould take them to be ſomething Enthuſiaſtical, but there is no Shew of Religion among them. The <hi>Hottentotts,</hi> (a <hi>Free People</hi>) as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Travellers tell us, come near them in Sound, but with leſs Impetuoſity. From their Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they may paſs for <hi>French</hi> Prophets, but I think they deſerve neither <hi>Toleration</hi> nor <hi>Indulgence.</hi> There have been Arguments us'd by Men of Wit, and God knows of Probity, to ſupport all the Follies that have appeared in the World. Mr. <hi>Herbert, an old ſolemn Bard of our own,</hi> a Defender of Joking to the laſt Extent, has obſerved, <hi>That every Thing is big with Jeſt, and has Wit in it, if you can find it out.</hi> I neither doubt your Power Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically, Aſtrologically, or Mathematically; yet if you can reduce theſe Sounds into any Compaſs, if you can form any Figure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſomething inarticulate, though the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition

He tells me, he ſhould be as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed if his Friends did not come and ſee him while his Garden is in its Pride, as a fine Lady would be on her Day, if no Body came to admire how well ſhe was lighted up.</p>
               <p>I went down on <hi>Monday</hi> laſt to his Houſe. It was almoſt dark when I arrived, and I found my Friend watering his Pots with his own Hand, and covering the choiceſt of them with Glaſſes, leſt the Inclemency of one Froſty Night, in ſo uncertain a Climate as ours is, ſhould ſhorten the Duration of a Pleaſure which is but too Tranſitory even in its longeſt Continuance.

Harmonious Voices, ſweet Breaths, fine Complexions, blooming Youth, and then for Conſtancy, (one of my poor Turtles is dying of a Widowhood) Where will you match me theſe in the reſt of the World? You durſt not talk at that Rate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd I, nor I hear you, but at the Age of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty, though it is natural for every one to give as much Dignity as he can to whatever he is fond of. Dignity! interrupted <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> a little warmly, we want no Dignity, or at leaſt we need not ſtrain a Point for it. Pray, Friend <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when Man was made lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower than the Angels, what was he? A Prince, a General, or a Great Miniſter? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He was a Gardiner. Pray what is it
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0397200205:211"/>
that diſtinguiſhes Man from Beaſts? Why all Philoſophers ſay, Reaſon. Philoſophers are Puppies; if Man were diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the Creation by Reaſon, would he not be diſtinguiſh'd by the nobleſt Operation of Reaſon; the cultivating a virtuous Mind? But how is that? Ask any of theſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers for Examples of Cruelty, Luſt, of Avarice, of Diſobedience to Parents, of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, of Ambition, of Treachery, of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, of any Vice they ſhall bring you Inſtances of all theſe from Kings, Queens, Generals, Popes, and even Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: But talk to them of Fidelity, they quote you the Dog; of Piety to Parents, the Stork; of Induſtry, the Ant and the Bee; of Meekneſs, the Lamb; of Courage, the Lion; and of Conſtancy, there my poor Turtle comes in again. Oh! Reaſon is a dainty Thing; I love that noble Diſtinction mightily: 'Tis almoſt as good as Riſibility. Hold, dear <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> ſaid I, pray let us be diſtinguiſhed ſome Way or other, or let us go naked as they do, and ſave Taylors Bills; or rather let us get Hair and Feathers on our Skins, for I doubt I ſhould not like to walk about pull'd neither."</q> He ſmiled upon me, and went on, <q rend="inline">"I deſign to diſtinguiſh for you too: The true Diſtinction between Man and Beaſt, and which <hi>ſoli Homini convenit</hi> is Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening. <hi>Homo eſt Animal Horticolum:</hi> Upon that Condition you may differ from Beaſts as much as you pleaſe, and be as diſtinct a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as you can.

one in a Romance, that if it would not make this Paper too long, I could be content to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it: About Seven a Clock my Friend came into my Chamber, and told me I was going to be very Happy as ſoon as I had drank my Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate, for every Thing conſpired to make our Walk ſo pleaſant, that, what with the Perfume of the Flowers, and the Harmony of the Birds, he queſtioned whether I would regret either the Smoak or the Noiſes of <hi>London.</hi> There were Two Parterres on either Side of the Houſe, which were ſeparated by a neat Eſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier from the reſt of the Garden. Theſe were deſtined for the Reception of the Flowers of Quality, ſuch as <hi>Auricula's, Tulips, Anemonies, Ranunculus's,</hi> and <hi>Carnations,</hi> who lived here removed from the Commerce of the People of Flowers which inhabit the Remainder of this vegetable Kingdom. My Friend was pleaſed to ſee me ſurprized with the Beauties of his Benches of <hi>Auricula's.</hi> He made me take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Notice of Number I. which he told me was honoured with the Name of a Great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and the reſt of the Confederacy ſtood in their proper Places after her. The next Series my Friend enlarged more upon, finding I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to taſt the Entertainment, and made me remark a Flower which was a little overblown; but he told me it had been wonderfully fine in its Time, and whiſpered me in the Ear the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Name it went by: <q rend="inline">"And what I value it for exceedingly, ſaid he, is, That I have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe Four Seedlings which ſtand next her from this Flower. There was a Fifth, but I could not preſerve it: If we had not ſuch Loſſes, we ſhould be too happy."</q> In ſhort, he went on with above Fifty fine Ladies one after another, and I believe would never have given off if I had not interrupted him,

Juſt by the <hi>Cock-Pit,</hi> at the <hi>Privy-Garden</hi> Door, there ſtep'd up gently to me an ancientiſh Woman, in a little black Hood, a Whisk Band, and a Crape Gown, and in a ſoft low Voice calls to me, "<hi>Sir.</hi> I could never think it Charity to relieve your Street-Beggars: What little I do in that Kind, is chiefly to Charity-Schools, and decayed Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers.

But indeed the Troubles I have gone thro' ſince you and I danced toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Mayor's Feaſt at <hi>Litchfield,</hi> would have altered a better Face than I could ever pretend to. Whatever Changes Time and Trouble may have made in you, ſaid I, I'm ſure it has not made ſo much in me, but that I am mightily concerned to know what has happened to you, ſince I am now aſſured you can be no other than Mrs. <hi>Olivia Darkin,</hi> for whom once I paſs'd ſo many uneaſy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. Well, Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> I muſt own—But pray ſit down, ſaid I—And <hi>Mary,</hi> D'ye hear? Bring me a Pint of that Sack in the Corner, and bake a Toaſt. Well, pray go on.

In ſhort, Sir, we were no ſooner married, but he carried me over with him to the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> where he had Relations who were well enough to paſs, and what with their Aſſiſtance, and that little we had of our own, we made a pretty good Shift for ſome Years, 'till the War breaking out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> my Husband was too zealous for the Popiſh Intereſt, and entered into the Service of the late K— <hi>J—s.</hi> I told him

Never talk on it, ſaid I, I'll die a Thouſand Deaths before I'll change my Religion, and ſo he never preſs'd me any more about it. But as I had foretold, ſo it happened, he was killed at the Siege of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> and our Houſe plundered; I may ſafely ſay they did not leave me the Value of this Rag to wind about my Finger."</q> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Relations! Ah Lord! ſaid ſhe, they were his Relations, not mine; and when he went, all went with him: You muſt think, Sir, I went to 'em, but they looked as coldly upon me as if I came to take the Bread out of their Mouths. At laſt, they agreed among 'em to take one of my Girls off my Hands, and gave me Five Pounds to carry me over to <hi>England.</hi> But when I came there, I was never the near, for I had anger'd all my Friends in Marrying; and I dare ſay ſome of 'em were glad to ſee me in ſuch Neceſſity.

It pleaſed God ſhe died in about Two Years after, and left me in Money and Goods to the Value of Four hundred Pounds. Upon this I pluck'd up a good Heart again, and had ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers made me from ſubſtantial Farmers of good Repute in the Neighbourhood; but it

was a Sort of Life I did not care for, and having no Thoughts of altering my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing would ſerve me but I muſt come up to Town here; and having a Stock of Linen, and other good Things that my Aunt left me, I hired a handſome Houſe, and took Lodgers. Well, why this put you in a good Way again, ſaid I, interrupting her. Yes indeed, Sir, ſaid ſhe, I had ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Men and other very good Gentlemen in my Houſe, and lived as creditably as any Body in my Employ; ſo that in a few Years I thought I ſhould be able to do very well for my Children.

and as ſoon as ſhe was up, Well, Mother, ſays ſhe, I will not live here to be a Diſgrace to you, I'll try my Fortune in the <hi>Indies.</hi> So I agreed with a <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Captain of my Acquaintance, ſince the Girl had ſuch a Mind to travel into foreign Parts; but the firſt News I had by the Return of the Ships was, that ſhe died of the Diſtemper of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Still I was in Hopes my Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> would do well; but he was got in with an idle Gang, who would ſend for him at all Hours in the Night. I was fond of him, and ſed him with Money till I was almoſt redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced again, in Hopes to reclaim him by fair Means: At other Times I would talk to him ſeriouſly, and tell him he had had another Sort of an Education: But nothing would do; I found I was but a Woman; he would give me the Hearing, and then away to his Comrades. But one Day above the reſt, there was a great Noiſe of a Robbery and Murder that had been committed upon <hi>Bagſhot-Heath,</hi> and my Son, among others, was taken up and carried to <hi>Newgate.</hi> Upon his Tryal, he confeſſed he was among them, and was found guilty; but he declared with his laſt Breath, he was not concerned in the Murder. I was with him every Day after his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. He told me all along he was willing to die; but I did what I could with Money and Friends, till I had nothing left, to get his Pardon; and a Gentleman who belonged to the Court, and had formerly been my Lodger, gave me Hopes to the laſt, and bid me fear nothing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

is it come to this? I repented afterwards that I had deluded my poor Child with vain Promiſes; for he relied ſo much upon them, that I am afraid he did not make ſo good an End as he ſhould have done. It was a bad End indeed, ſaid I, for an only Son; but Children, you know, are certain Troubles, and uncertain Comforts: However, what's paſt can't be recalled. I am ſorry for your Misfortunes; but pray tell me, Do you want any little Aſſiſtance that I can give you? Sir, ſaid ſhe, I'll conceal nothing from you; I want for nothing: I have between Six and Seven Hundred Pounds by me, which I have pick'd up in this Way, and hope that will put me above Dependance for the reſt of my Life."</q> I drank again to her to renew our old Acquaintance, and ſo we parted. She left me ſo full of Reflections upon the Eſcape I had had when I would have married her, that I could not ſleep a Wink that Night.</p>

               <p>EVER ſince I have taken upon me the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Cenſor of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> it has been my principal Care to guard my ſelf againſt all Manner of juſt Reproaches, which might depretiate thoſe wholeſome Maxims which I every Day diſtribute to the Publick, and to fence againſt all thoſe Vices which render old Age contemptible. And 'tis wholly owing to this that I have never fallen into that common Weakneſs of finding Fault with the preſent only for an Excuſe to cry up the laſt Age. I muſt own I have had a great Itch to do it, but as I weigh every Thing before I attempt doing it, I find upon mature Deliberation, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

ſpeaking the Age is virtuouſly inclined, and that what Faults it has proceed chiefly from excellent Principles, and might be made Virtues with a very little Trouble. For, in the firſt Place, I obſerve that Part of Mankind, where one would leaſt expect it, to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inclined to Oeconomy; I mean the Young and the Fair of Quality. No Froſt, Snow, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But as the City does generally value it ſelf upon out-doing t'other End of the Town in theſe Matters, ſo I have long obſerved, with infinite Satisfaction, a certain Coach, which I eſteem particularly. It belongs to a worthy Trader in or near <hi>Well-Cloſe,</hi> and no Diſparagement to <hi>Charles</hi>'s-<hi>Wain,</hi> it keeps its Courſe as regularly as any Fix'd Star of 'em all. The Family to which this wondrous Automaton belongs, goes to Dinner as ſoon as Morning Service is over, they ſet out in the Cool of the Noon, about Half an Hour after Twelve, and, according to the Rule of diſcreet Travellers, make the Coachman drive ſlowly at firſt, by which they have Two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; one, that they ſee all the Company go to Church in the City, and the other, that their Horſes have Time to empty themſelves. At <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> they ſtop and give the Cattel a Mouthful of Hay, have a cool Tankard, or the like, and any of the Gentlewomen that have Occaſion ſtep out of the Coach. By the End of <hi>Suffolk-ſtreet</hi> they mend their Pace, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0397200205:228"/>
get into a tolerable Trot, which brings them ſo happily to the fartheſt Part of their Journey, and in ſuch good Time, that they are there as ſoon as the beſt of 'em. I remember laſt Year I was over-againſt <hi>Northumberland</hi> Houſe when this Caravan repoſed there; they were Five of the Fair Sex, Three pretty fat ones, one very fat, and a lean one. They were all ſure of the Thouſand Pounds a Year in the Lottery, and almoſt fell out about their ſeveral Ways of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of it. The fatteſt of them ſaid, <q rend="inline">"If it ſhould pleaſe God to take away her Maſter, ſhe would not change her Condition tho' ſhe ſhould get the Thouſand Pounds a Year, but would lay it up to make her Children love her; but if they ſhould prove undutiful, ſhe could not tell how far ſhe might be prevailed upon; but an't pleaſe God ſhe'd never mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Seaman again, ſhe'd have no more Frights and Twitters at every puff of Wind."</q> The next in Size to her Ladiſhip ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Laud Mother, Why to be ſure, Forſooth, you won't have it; you'll have enough without it. Child, ſaid her Mother, Will you never leave off that ugly Trick? Can't you call a Body, Madam? I wou'd to God I had ſent you to <hi>Chelſey</hi> inſtead of <hi>Stepney,</hi> but 'twas ſuch a great Way off. Prithee, Siſter, don't fright your ſelf, ſays another, I ſhall have it mun; for I was adreamed, and ſo methought there came a fine Gentleman to me, in a Cinnamon-colour'd Coat and Gold Buttons, and a long Wig, and a Gold Chain about his Neck, and ſo he ax'd me to go with him to his Country-Houſe at <hi>Grinitch,</hi> and methought he had my Lord Mayor's Bage and Tiſdale, and the City Muſick, and he ſaid as how 'twas becauſe I had a great Forti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The Third ſaid, ſhe was ſure ſhe ſhould have it, becauſe ſhe had a Mind to it; and if ſhe got it, ſhe'd come away immediately to that very Coffee-houſe yonder, and ſend for one of thoſe young Officers out, and marry him immediately; and then, Madam, I'll come and wait upon you in my Glaſs Chariot, and paſs my Time like a little Queen. Ah, <hi>Mal!</hi> ſaid the old one, thou art a mad Girl; thou'dſt think on't twice—Ay ſo I ſhall Forty Times, ſaid ſhe; till the Lottery is drawn, I ſhall do nothing but think on't: But Siſter <hi>Rachel</hi> ſays nothing. Why, ſays the lean one, I'm ſatisfied none of you will have it, for 'tis come into my Head juſt now that I ſhall have it my ſelf; and I'll take a Houſe in <hi>Devonſhire-Square,</hi> and get a Set to play all Day long at <hi>Lue,</hi> and never marry, but deſpiſe Mankind; though now I think on't, if any of you have a Girl to my Mind, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may breed her up, and when I die, leave her all I have, and then ſhe may be married to a Lord: Look'ee there now."</q> It grieved me mightily to ſee the Coach drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at this Period, and I could not but make this Reflection: How Five People could be ſanguine enough to expect the great Lot, which was One hundred and fifty thouſand to One whether either of them had it, and of the many Thouſand Owners of Coaches in and about this great City, not one of them was afraid of having their Necks broke at the <hi>Park,</hi> where the Odds are not above Two hundred at moſt; nay, Folks are glad to borrow a Chance for being crippled. I concluded with my ſelf, that thoſe who come from the wary Part of the Town, had perhaps had the Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to inſure in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> without which
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0397200205:230"/>
I thought it impoſſible Ladies ſhould venture to travel ſo far to run ſuch Dangers; for we may perceive by the Number of Offices now in Town, that it is no longer in Faſhion to ride Poſt to Sieges: But the Myſtery was ſoon explained as to theſe <hi>Well-Cloſe</hi> Pilgrims; for that very Evening my honeſt Friend <hi>Faber</hi> would needs take me from St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park</hi> with him to eat a cold Chicken and Sallad, and drink a Flask of <hi>Flurrence,</hi> as he calls it; and as we were looking out at Window in the <hi>Pall-Mall,</hi> and ſeeing the Coaches going to the <hi>Park,</hi> I ſaw my Lady and her Daughters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. I had an Inclination to ſmile at firſt; but upon Reflection, I could not but admire the Sagacity of thoſe People, who (having a great Way to go) come out of the <hi>Park</hi> when others are going in, for by that Means they ſee all the Company, and avoid all the Danger.</p>

               <p>I Cannot without Admiration behold the forward Pretenſions of the Youth of this Age, wherein we daily find Boys exerting the very firſt Operations of their Minds in the moſt abſtruſe Parts of Learning; ſo that one would th nk the Souls of their Great Grandfathers had tranſmigrated into them. This praecoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wit, as it is very unbecoming in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Man of my Years, ſo is it likewiſe very ominous to the Perſons who are poſſeſſed with it; for they are generally ſhort-liv'd, and give Occaſion to their Mothers to ſay, The poor Child had too much Senſe to live long. It is therefore my Opinion, That this great Vice takes its Beginning entirely from taking Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren too ſoon f om the Breaſt, and admitting them ſo early to the Uſe of a luxurious Variety in their Food, which forces an Underſtanding before its due Time. I have therefore, from a
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0397200205:232"/>
long Obſervation amongſt young Fellows, as I find them in their Converſation, and according to the Subjects which they handle, been able to tell the very Day when the Nurſe applied the bitter Drug to the Nipple, to give them an Averſion to Sucking. There was a Law among that wiſe People the <hi>Romans,</hi> That no Man ſhould kill above Thirty Aſſes at a Time for a Banquet; and the Reaſon was, that they being a Creature then eſteemed a great Dainty, and a vaſt Conſumption of them, there was found at length a great Defect of their Milk for the Education of the Offspring of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to the unſpeakable Pain and Labour of the good Women, who were otherwiſe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſuckle their Children till they ſhould be fit to carry Arms in Defence of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I have therefore, out of a due Reſpect to ſuch an excellent Example, and to prevent the Inconveniencies of theſe too early Eſſays in Things of ſublime Science, ordered the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Mr. <hi>Charles Bubbleboy</hi> to get made for the Uſe of the Publick, from Time to Time, a ſufficient Number of Sucking-Bottles, which all young Fellows under the Age of Twenty are to hang with a Chain about their Necks. And I likewiſe ordain, That when any Perſon under the Age above written ſhall preſume to launch out of his Depth in Theoretical Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſhall be in the Power of any By-ſtander to apply the Bottle to his Mouth, and make him ſuck.</p>
               <p>I hope by this Simplicity of Diet in ſome reaſonable Time ſo far to reform the Manners of Youth in Converſation, that no one under the Age aforementioned ſhall preſume to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Limits of Grammatical Learning in Diſcourſe; and likewiſe to augment the

For this Reaſon I was looked upon as a meer Idiot all the Time of my Childhood, and lived in a State of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to an Age wherein others are wont to exert egregious Signs of Wiſdom. I remember very well, that I ſucked my Mother till I was able to carry my Cradle on my Back, and could not ſpeak a Word till I was Ten Years old, being a perfect <hi>Pythagorean</hi> by Nature, and always more inclinable to hear than talk, till I grew ſo full of Conceptions, that at laſt I was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give Vent by Writing, as my Thoughts oppreſs'd me, the Delivery of which hath had that wonderful Effect as to make me arrive at the Dignity of being Cenſor of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>

               <p>MY Curioſity led me the other Day to be preſent at the Election at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> School, where I met with an Entertainment of Juvenile Exerciſes ſuitable to my Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obſerved with great Satisfaction thoſe pretty Velitations of Wit, which may be called the politer Parts of Grammatical Learning, and are the promiſing Preludes of future Perfections in the ſublime Sciences. Thoſe little Epigram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Flowers, in which you behold Poetry in her Spring, very various in her Array of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, but not daring yet to ſhoot high from the Earth, which were then offered up as Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

the Subject commended, and which ought to be the particular Province of an Epick Poet.</p>
               <p>When I firſt entered the School, I was ſtruck with a becoming Awe and Veneration to ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a Place, and the Dignity of the Perſon preſiding in it, not without a due Regard to the <hi>Faſces,</hi> which are the Symbol of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. I could not then forbear taking the Perſon and Office of a Schoolmaſter into a nearer Conſideration, and to propoſe him to my Mind in the Abſtract, with a View of what he teaches.</p>
               <p>A Schoolmaſter is a compleat Treaſury of choſen Words from Claſſick Authors, the very Compoſition of whoſe Body does not ſeem to owe it ſelf ſo much to the Four Phyſicical Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to the Four and twenty Letters of the Alphabet; and yet with ſo little Confuſion in his Contexture, that he ſhall be able, as it were, to unravel his whole Subſtance into Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms, Proper Diction, Golden Sentences, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Themes, and Declamations. You would think the Oeconomy of his Houſe was directed entirely according to the Three Special Rules, and that the Book of Tenſes ſerved for a Clock to it. His proper Buſineſs is to teach Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, which he diſtributes as ſound Aliment to his Scholars, giving every one ſuch a Portion for a Meal, and with that Impartiality, that no one complains of having too little.</p>

               <p>LOng have I laboured, and much have I travelled, for the Improvement of my Fellow-Subjects. I have not been wanting by my Speculations to ſhow the eaſy and pleaſant Ways to Virtue; nor have I been leſs ſevere in cenſuring Vice wherever I met it, which I find every where increaſe, and come on apace, while Virtue ſlowly creeps up, meets with continual Oppoſition, and ſeldom, very ſeldom comes to that Perfection as to dare to look Vice in the Face; but then it eaſily looks ſuch falſe Courage out of Countenance. It was moſt amazing to me, when I was Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at St. <hi>James</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, to ſee a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Youth, well dreſſed and powdered, whom I knew not only to be of very mean Extract, but of more deſpicable Parts, lay his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Chin over a Duke's Shoulder, and as familiarly ask him impertinent Queſtions, as if his Equality or Intimacy entitled him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb that noble Peer, who, when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Weight of his Chin, enquired who he was. How eaſy had it been for me to have told the Company, that that Place was

indeed very fit for him, but in another Capaci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty? However I only privately informed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>DIſcouraged and wearied by the ill Succeſs of my Endeavours to reclaim this obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Age f om its Vices and Follies, I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten had it in my Thoughts to quit my Office. My Friends all importune me to it, and one of them, whom in <hi>January</hi> laſt I had deſired to continue this Paper during a neceſſary Avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine, actually tried to lay it down handſomly for me. Nothing has hindered me from complying with their Requeſts, but a ſtrong Benevolence I have always had towards Mankind, and an ardent Deſire of doing ſome Good in my Generation. Theſe alone have ſupported me under my Diſappointment, and now prompt me to put in Execution a new Scheme, which is to abate ſomething from the Grandeur of my Enterprize; and, ſince I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain a greater Good, to attempt a leſs, no longer endeavouring to eaſe Men of their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but in their Follies; nor ſtriving to make
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0397200205:252"/>
Men ſupportable to each other, but each one to himſelf. This Thought aroſe in me the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Night at the Play, upon obſerving ſeveral Difficulties that many of our Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try laboured under. A pretty young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tore his Breeches, and broke his Sword, by getting over the Box into the Pit, that he might have that Opportunity of expoſing to Sight his Pearl-coloured Stockings and red-top'd Shoes. Another, who had a very fine Wig, and a Feather in his Hat, was forced to ſit covered all the Time, and ſpoil the Wig to ſhew the Feather. A Third, leſt his fring'd Gloves ſhould not be ſeen, underwent the Pain of leaning forwards for a whole Play together upon the fore Part of the Box, ſetting his Arms upright upon his Elbows. A Fourth, who was in low Circumſtances of Stature, every now and then with great Labour heaved into Sight a rich Sword-Knot: And many others were variouſly hamper'd and perplex'd in diſplaying their ſeveral Fineries. To remedy which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, I at firſt thought it might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to adviſe the Owners of the Play-houſe to appropriate each Diviſion of the Side-Boxes to a ſeveral Dreſs, and to diſtinguiſh them by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions over them in large Letters in theſe and the like Words:<list>
                     <item>Red-top'd Shoes.</item>
                     <item>Sword-Knots.</item>
                     <item>Feathers.</item>
                     <item>Fring'd Gloves.</item>
                     <item>Gold Snuff-Boxes.</item>
                     <item>Dreſs'd at all Points.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>By which Means the whole Audience would at one Glance be appriz'd of the particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of every Perſon in that Diviſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0397200205:253"/>
But reflecting ſince that this Invention would be of too narrow an Uſe, (it being likely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only to the Play-houſe, and perhaps a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral or two) I have applied my ſelf to find out ſomething that may be of general Eaſe to the Beau Monde; proceeding in this Manner; I conſidered what might be the Riſe or Cauſe of all that vaſt Variety of Faſhions which we Yearly ſee. This I found to be ſolely the Oftentation of Riches; for upon this Accoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it is, that People have no ſooner one Sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> brought Home from the Taylor's, but (to ſhew that their Purſe is not exhauſted) they beſpeak another, which (that it may appear to the moſt careleſs Eye to be a late Purchaſe) muſt differ from the former, not only in Matter, but in Form. This in the preſent Courſe of Things will be an eternal Occaſion of the Mutability of Faſhions, and as a Man has but one Way of being in the Right, and Ten thouſand of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Wrong, ſo there can be but one Dreſs commodious, and as ſoon as we deviate from that, we ſhall find all the reſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. I therefore thought, that if a Medium could be invented by me, whereby both the Fair and the Foul. Sex might at once be rid of the Incumbrances of the Mode, and be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Reputation of Profuſeneſs, I ſhould do an acceptable Piece of Service to my Country, and procure to my ſelf Peace of Mind in a Conſciouſneſs that I had not lived in vain. This I hope I have at laſt happily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the following Project:</p>
               <q>An Office ſhall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ed by the Name of <hi>The Equivalent Office.</hi> In this Office, any Perſon ſhall be admitted to pay down ſuch Sum or Sums of Money as he or ſhe ſhall be deſirous to expend in any particular
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0397200205:254"/>
Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Ornaments. Upon the Payment of ſuch Sum or Sums, and Intimation given what Piece of Finery it is deſigned for, there ſhall be made out a neat Ticket or Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial (in the Language of the Office) to be worn in the moſt conſpicuous Part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, certifying to all Men, that the Wearer thereof has actually laid out ſo much Money as would have purchaſed ſuch an Ornament therein deſcribed, and requiring them to deem, eſteem and repute the ſaid Wearer as <hi>ipſo facto</hi> wearing the ſaid Ornament, any Thing in outward Appearance to the contrary notwithſtanding.</q>
               <p>The Advantages that will ariſe from this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice are innumerable. I ſhall only hint at a few, which will put the Reader into a Way of diſcovering many more.</p>
               <p>By Vertue of proper Credentials, Gentlemen may wear Wigs of ſuch Size and Colour as ſhall beſt ſuit with their Features and Complexions, and yet have the Credit of Light Full-Bottoms. Thick Legs may be diminiſhed by black Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Spindle-Shanks enlarged by white, yet both be reputed as Scarlet Silk. Corns may be avoided by keeping the Feet in eaſy old Shoes, and yet the Owner maintain the Reputation of having a new Pair every Day. Ladies, by theſe Credentials, may yet farther enlarge their Petticoats, which in their preſent Method is impoſſible to be done. They may make their Head-Dreſſes proportionable to their Petticoats, and they may patch their Faces with Diamonds without Diſparagement to their Eyes.</p>
               <p>I am not inſenſible how highly beneficial this Scheme might be in raiſing Money for the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0397200205:255"/>
Publick; but a former Project of mine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been rejected with Scorn when I offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and Two Years after made Uſe of with good Succeſs, but without any Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of or to the Inventor, I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted from making any more Propoſals of that Nature. I had once a Mind to apply the Profits to Charitable Uſes; but then I thought again, that doing Good with the Money would be ſo prodigious an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Application of it, that it would create an inſuperable. Objection againſt the whole Undertaking in thoſe who were likely to be my Contributors; ſo that I have at laſt reſolved to apply it wholly to my own Benefit.</p>

               <p>IT is impoſſible to deſcribe Wit by Generals: We muſt deſcend to Particulars, and trace it Part by Part.

                  </hi> and <hi>Jingle;</hi> and when it conſiſts chiefly in the Thought, the ſame Diligence is required that it may not ſink into any of thoſe <hi>Flowers</hi> of the School, or <hi>Common-Places</hi> of Youth, by which they gradually aſcend to this Attainment. Both the <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Verbal Turn</hi> owe their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Novelty; for there is no greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in theſe Witticiſms, than what ariſes from that ſudden Surprize they make upon the Imagination. They ſeem to take their Name from their Nature; for they conſiſt moſtly in advancing a Thought or Expreſſion, and then making what follows, play upon it in an agreeable Way, either by retracting what went before, or wittily perverting it, or comparing it with ſomething that hits the ſame Fact or Idea to any Degree of Exactneſs, or giving ſome ſurprizing Reaſon for it when it ſeemed a Paradox. Indeed, the Variety of Turns is ſo great, and their Beauty ſo entirely owing to this Variety, that it is almoſt impoſſible to fix them to any ſtated Rules. A <hi>Turn</hi> being the Product of Fancy, it is unnatural to uſe it but in thoſe gayer and more airy Parts of Poetry, where the Fancy is at Liberty to wanton and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0397200205:258"/>
gambol. In the <hi>Epick,</hi> in <hi>Tragedy,</hi> or in that Sort of <hi>Elegy</hi> which has Diſtreſs for its Subject, it would be ridiculous and trifling; for here the chief Buſineſs belongs to the Judgment, and the Fancy is only concerned in ranging for Images and Ideas equal to the Grandeur of the Subject. A Hero in a Paſſion, might as well expreſs the high Sentiments of his Soul by laughing at one of the Plumes out of his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, as by playing with a Turn or a Double Entendre. A Lover, lamenting the Rigour of his Miſtreſs, or a Poet the Loſs of his Friend, in this ſportive Way, would make as aukward a Figure as the reſigned <hi>Ardelia,</hi> when ſhe laughs at the Miſchiefs committed by her Monkey, though the Loſs of her <hi>China</hi> wrings her very Soul; or an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> in his Country Way, ſinging at a Funeral. The Ancients had Abundance of this Sort of Wit, and uſed it more diſcreetly than the Moderns. The <hi>Greeks</hi> indeed appear perfect Strangers to it: They had other Ways to improve that Mirth which was ſo natural to them. <hi>Anacreon</hi> and <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> write in a Way where <hi>Turns</hi> are a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet it is very difficult to find ſo much as one Expreſſion of that Sort in their Works. <hi>Homer, Heſiod, Theocritus,</hi> and <hi>Muſaeus,</hi> have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it in their Poems. It ſeems to have begun at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Epigrams</hi> became the common Entertainment of their beſt People. After Supper, or over a Bottle in a cool Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, it was their Cuſtom to divert one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with reciting or compoſing three or four <hi>Diſtichs,</hi> that were uſually pointed with one of theſe Turns, in which they were ſmart upon ſome of the reigning Coxcombs, Coquets, or Humours of that Age.

               <p>THE Hours to me are Ages of Miſery; they muſt be inſupportable to a Wretch who can never know what Joy is but in her Preſence. Love may well be defined a reſtleſs Impatience to be with thoſe we adore. What a miſerable Conſtraint then muſt I live under, who make it my Buſineſs to avoid the Miſtreſs of my Soul? Where my Heart, my Wiſhes, my Thoughts are eternally, there I muſt never be. Did ſhe but know what I ſuffer, and how much a Diſcretion as exact as mine makes one miſerable; but alas! they muſt love like me that are to gueſs at my Torments. I hardly know I live, but by what I endure for her. O! Nothing can touch my Soul; there is no Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0397200205:262"/>
in Words, unleſs ſhe ſpeaks-them; there is no Bliſs, but in her Smile; no Terror, but in her Frown; nothing worth living for, but her Eſteem. There is this Comfort in an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction like mine, no other Thing can give me a Moment's Uneaſineſs. She prevents all other Grief, ſhe prevents all other Pleaſure. If the whole World ſhould change its Place, and ſhe not concerned, I ſhould hardly perceive it. Whether Peace or War, what Party prevails, whoſe Ruin is near, all theſe Things are now indifferent, they employ not my Thoughts. My only Impatience is to increaſe her good Opinion, my only Care not to forfeit her Eſteem. This Thought brings me into one of thoſe terrible Fits of Fear which often ſeize them that adore her. I know I am not in poſitive Diſobedience; and a little Equivocation, if ſo much practiſed in Religion, may be indulged in Love. I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther write nor ſend to her; I dare not diſobey. Sure if there be any Thing like a Fault in this, I am ſafe. Who is it is to accuſe? Who is guilty? And I hope I may ſay, What is the Crime? This Letter is ſent to you, meant to her, and it came from him; but, Who are theſe? In this Dreſs, it is to every Body, it is to no Body. How will you draw up my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment? However let me not be condemn'd unaccus'd, unheard; ſave me from being cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, if you can think me ſo. Burn this, and there can be but a ſingle Evidence againſt me, your ſelf; and there never ſhall be another. This is the plotting Way of your Servant, who with leſs Fear would engage in Treaſon than in what might offend her too ſcrupulous Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I confeſs I tremble, tho' I can ſay (if this be one) it is a new Kind of Sin, againſt which there is no Law.</p>

I knew there muſt be Wit and Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I heard ſo, and I found more than was ſpoken of. Thus I was ſtruck by Prepoſſeſſion, and the Poiſon firſt inſtilled into my Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaw or knew her, can never be removed from thence by all that I ſhall ever ſee or know. I would not profane a Confeſſion as ſincere as ever was a dying Man's with the leaſt Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Truth. I will not pretend that I have not endeavoured to remove, by any other Object, a Stroke of Fate (as I may call it) that has given and will give me ſuch Uneaſineſs. Were I to make a Wiſh for a Friend, he ſhould have many Half-Paſſions, but none ſuch as I have felt for her.</p>
               <p>O! This would content me alone, that ſhe might know how long I have ſtruggled againſt her Charms in vain.</p>
               <p>As the Beginning of my Fate was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, I think all the Steps of it have been and will be out of the common Road. The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a common Paſſion is a Deſire to pleaſe ones ſelf, but the Aim of mine is only to pleaſe her I adore.</p>

O the falſe Fires with which the perſecuting Fops afflict your Sex! Every Way falſe! They are not ſuch as warm my Breaſt. Though I could leap through Flames to come to her, and not feel more Heat; though I could ſwim through Seas, and not quench the Flame; yet I love with that Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Temper, with that Command over my Paſſion, that, rather than bring her to the leaſt Inconveniency, I would renounce the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Happineſs if it were in my Reach. One would think this were enough to be allowed the moſt paſſionate, the moſt miſerable of Men. Miſery beyond this is hardly to be conceived. This ſeems Torment enough in Love to drag an afflicted Heart through ſo many diſtracted Fears for ſuch an Eternity: But to have lived accuſed of having deſerved her Anger, to think I was accounted Criminal, that knew the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der faithful Paſſion of my Soul; to live thus for Ages, for many Months without obtaining one happy to be juſtified, without doing any Thing raſh or indiſcreet to ſhow my Innocence: This you will ſure allow to have been Torment and Diſcretion beyond any Example.</p>
