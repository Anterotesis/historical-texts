            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>
               </hi> Man who offers to the World any thing not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore known, or not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally underſtood, muſt expect to meet with two ſorts of Adverſaries; who won't fail to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him, tho they are as inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with each other, as with the Truth: that is to ſay, ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will deny the Invention as either not practicable, or not uſeful; whilſt others at the ſame time, who are convinc'd of the Worth of it, will tell you, that it was long before
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0202400900:5"/>known and practis'd, and that you muſt not challenge to your ſelf the Glory. Thus our Immortal <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,</hi> when he happily diſcover'd the Circulation of the Blood, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd on both ſides; and tho I won't pretend to compare what I here offer with his noble Diſcovery, yet it won't he deſpis'd when it's conſider'd that the Circulation of the Blood is a Speculation not ſo immediately uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as what you have in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sheets, which is to reſcue Men in the Agony of Death.</p>
            <p>They who ſay the opening an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is not to be practis'd but in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Caſes, own it to be a Remedy when all others fail, but at the ſame time would not have it practis'd till all Remedies are too late.</p>
            <p>They who ſay this is an Operation us'd of old, won't, I hope, quarrel
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0202400900:6"/>with me for preferring the Antiquity of Truth before the Novelty of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; at leaſt I won't quarrel with them, being much more intent upon doing Service to Mankind, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Reputation to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>They who alledg that Evacuation by an Artery makes a greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Spirits than by a Vein, will find themſelves ſo fully confuted in the following Treatiſe, that I need ſay nothing more here. In ſhort, I take the great and ſacred Rule of Phyſick to be the Obſervation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and her Dictates; <hi>Quo Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura tendit.</hi> Now I would ask my Adverſaries to produce one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance where Nature ever reliev'd her ſelf by a Vein; and if there he no Inſtance of it, then to uſe that Veſſel is to croſs Nature. Thus we ſee that the vaſt Quantity of Blood which often iſſues from the Noſe, as
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0202400900:7"/>well as the great Diſcharge by the Piles (as they are vulgarly call'd) is ſtill Arterial Blood. But the moſt notable Inſtance is the menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood in Women, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flows from 'em in Streams to an unknown Quantity, and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd from the Arteries in the <hi>Ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and <hi>Vagina:</hi> whereas ſhould it proceed from the Veins, it would be impoſſible for 'em to ſubſiſt under it.</p>
            <p>It is plain therefore that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine I advance is agreeable to the Dictates of Nature; and if Nature be for me, I don't much care who is againſt me.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> NEW METHOD <hi>Of Curing APOPLEXIES, AND</hi> Other Diſtempers of the HEAD.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Otwithſtanding the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Treatiſes that have been writ by learned and ingenious Men, as well antient as modern, on this Subject, which have been han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with the greateſt Accurateneſs as to the Theory; yet for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0202400900:9"/>of treating it thro the whole Courſe, particularly at its firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, I find nothing writ more forreign from the Purpoſe: For by bleeding out of the Veins, and other uſual Methods of Practice, they prey upon and exhauſt the animal Spirits, and confirm the Diſtemper, rather than relieve the Patient.</p>
            <p>But not to detain the Reader with the Meaſures others have taken, and ſtill perſiſt in; I ſhall only offer my own Thoughts, and the Method by which for ſome Years paſt I've found ſuch happy Succeſs, as well in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> as elſewhere, confirm'd by a few Obſervations. Therefore without any further Introduction, I ſhall juſt deſcribe this Diſeaſe, and proceed.</p>
            <p>'Tis then an Apoplexy when the Body is ſuddenly depriv'd of the chief Animal Faculties, as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal as external, and all voluntary Motion, ſo that the Animal Spirits are either deny'd a Paſſage from the Brain, or an Entrance into it; the Ventricles or Pores of the Brain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either compreſs'd from a Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0202400900:10"/>or obſtructed from a Plethora, Poiſons, Medicines endued with a Narcotic Faculty, which ſo alter the Blood, Lymph, and other Fluids, as to render 'em unfit to paſs freely thro the Arteries of the Brain, whereby, thro the violent Impetus of of the Heart, the Blood is ſo wedg'd in, that it cauſes a Stagnation; and oftentimes Polypuſes are form'd in the Carotids, Sinus's, and Vertebral Arteries, ſo that all the Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Nature can rally to ſupport the Fabric, are detach'd to the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Thorax, to perform Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, without which the Patient is inevitably loſt.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the Brain is the Seat of this Diſeaſe, 'twill not be at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to take notice of its Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as its Uſe, before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any farther. There are then two Subſtances which conſtitute the Brain, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cinericious, being the Exterior, call'd the Cortical; the inner, from its Whiteneſs and Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Medullary: the former of which, according to <hi>Malpigius,</hi> is nothing but a Gland of the conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0202400900:11"/>kind, or a Heap of ſmall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Glands contiguous with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to each of which is affix'd an Artery that brings the Blood, by the means of which Glands the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſtituting the Animal Spirits, is ſecern'd from its purer and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tler Parts: from hence the Veins carry back the refluent Blood, that's unfit for generating of Spirits; and then the Nerve, or Root of a Nerve, in which, as in an excretory Duct of a Gland, the Spirits juſt now perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are carry'd into the Medulla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subſtance, as a Storehouſe or Magazine, and from thence thro the whole nervous Syſtem, for the Benefit of conveying Senſe and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Animal Oeconomy.</p>
            <p>Now ſince not only the Corti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Subſtance of the Brain, but the Medullary alſo, and even the Nerves themſelves are interſpers'd with an infinite Number of exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſmall Blood-Veſſels; whatever cauſes an Obſtruction in them, or makes 'em too turgid, cauſes an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy in ſome degree or other, by preſſing on the Nerves, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0202400900:12"/>the Circulation of their Fluid.</p>
            <p>To diminiſh then the Quantity of Blood from the Veins, is what all have had immediate recourſe to as their chief Refuge and Aſylum, either from the Frontal, Jugular, Cephalic, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana for a Revulſion; whereas that is now exploded, the Laws of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation not admitting it: and if this did not anſwer their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Patient was given over as in a deſperate Caſe; according to this of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſpeaking of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, <hi>Venae ſectio, ni juvet, occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det;</hi> or this of <hi>Celſus,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Sanguinis detractio, vel oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit, vel liberat.</hi> Which is enough to convince us how prejudicial ſuch Evacuations from the Veins were found, and how uncertain the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was obſerv'd to be, even by the Antients; tho, for want of a better, it has unhappily been perſiſted in to this preſent time.</p>
            <p>'Twas indeed in many Caſes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently us'd by the Antients, but now become ſo much in vogue, that 'tis order'd almoſt on all Occaſions,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0202400900:13"/>except in Cachectic Perſons, or thoſe grown Hydropical by impoveriſh'd Blood, Diſeaſes contracted by Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Fatigue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the Obſtruction be where it will, tho at the Fingers end, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Vein muſt relieve it. I can't indeed wonder that the Antients did it, being in a manner Strangers to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy, and knowing nothing of the Circulation of the Blood: but ſince, by the indefatigable Induſtry of the Moderns, that Part of Learning is arriv'd to ſuch Perfection, I admire there's not more notice taken of the Inconveniencies that attend Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy; but 'tis paſt over as an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be attempted by any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at any Seaſon, regard being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had to the Strength of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, touching of the Nerve, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or its Aponeuroſis.</p>
            <p>But if by an Obſtruction, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, or any Diſtemper incident to the Head is caus'd; to make a more copious Evacuation, and ſpeedy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation, the Diſcharge muſt be made by opening the Jugulars: which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration falls ſo far ſhort of their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0202400900:14"/>Intention, that it proves far more diſmal in its Conſequences; by ſo much the more effectually confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Obſtruction, by how much the nearer the Ligatures approach the Part affected.</p>
            <p>Experienc'd Surgeons indeed will uſe no Ligature round the Neck, for fear of Suffocation in Apoplexies and Squinanceys but only let a Stander-by compreſs the Jugular, on the contrary ſide, with his Thumb, and fix their own juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Place where they deſign their Aperture. But too many uſe Ligatures, and either apply the middle of the Fillet behind the Neck, the two Ends being brought before and twiſted; or turn one End over one Clavicle, and under the contrary Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illa, and ſo the two Ends are brought before and faſtned: both which are very pernicious, particularly the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which by preſſing on the Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illary Vein, ſtops the refluent Blood; by which, beſides confirming the Obſtruction, as before mention'd, Syncopes, Palpitations, Tremors, and the like are cauſed: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0202400900:15"/>thwarts or croſſes the circular Progreſs of the Blood, produces theſe Effects.</p>
            <p>But even bleeding in the Arm, the Tediouſneſs of the Operation is ſuch, and the Advantage that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it ſo ſmall, I can by no means be reconcil'd to. For firſt the Ligature muſt be ſtrain'd, in order to cauſe the Veins to ſwell, for the more commodious introducing the Lancet; which perhaps after all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Surgeon's Frictions, to force the Blood to the intended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: and this is not ſufficient, but often there muſt be hot Cloaths, and the Arm plung'd in hot Water; and then when the Aperture is made, by the Miſapplication of the Bandage, the Skin relaxes, the Orifice cloſes, and obſtructs its Paſſage: and when the Impetuoſity of the Blood abates, the Ligature is again ſlacken'd, that as much Blood may paſs into that Part by the Arteries, as will ſuffice for the intended Evacuation. During which time, the Obſtruction is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming; for the Blood in the Veins ſteers an eaſy Courſe from nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0202400900:16"/>Paſſages to broader Channels, thro their ſoft Tunicles, quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe of the Arteries; whoſe Coats being elaſtic, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the large Trunks, give a Velocity to the Blood, which if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, cauſes the Blood to be ſo turgid in the capillary Veſſels of the Brain, even to extravaſate, and obſtructs the Spirits in the <hi>Senſorium Commune,</hi> the firſt Courſe of all Nervous Diſtempers; as Palſies, Cramps, Convulſions, Apoplexies, Emaciations, and inſenſible Decays, without any viſible Cauſe, that it would even poſe Perſons of the beſt Judgment to account for it; as alſo that Chronical Diſtemper, the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drocephalus,</hi> or watry Humour in the Head, which proceeds from extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated Lymph, occaſion'd by the Compreſſion of the Lymphatics.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince any unprejudiced Perſon, of the Inconveniences that attend Phlebotomy. If we reflect on the firſt Riſe of this Operation, 'twill not much heighten our Eſteem of it. <hi>Pliny,</hi> in his Natural Hiſtory,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0202400900:17"/>tells a whimſical Story of the <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popotamus,</hi> or Sea-Horſe; who, when he finds himſelf heavy or indiſpos'd, ſeeks out the ſharpeſt pointed Thorn, with which he pricks a certain Vein of the Leg; and after a Quantity of Blood is drawn, ſtops the Wound with Mud: a very poor Precedent, that we are oblig'd to have recourſe to for this Operation.</p>
            <p>But all the propoſed Ends will be anſwer'd <hi>by opening an Artery.</hi> Tho I'm well aſſur'd this Hypotheſis will be exploded by the greateſt part of the Faculty, it being not only what is uncommon, but alſo their being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted how the Operation is to be perform'd, and the hazard of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting it, will occaſion the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Objections, to render this Method trifling and inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>Some fancy with <hi>Celſus,</hi> that an Artery once cut, by reaſon of its Syſtole and Diaſtole, from the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Fibres, can't again conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and grow together, but forms a Thrombus.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0202400900:18"/>
            <p>Others have had Stupidity enough to affirm, that thoſe Veſſels muſt be paſt through with a Needle and Thread, in order to re-unite them.</p>
            <p>Again, there are thoſe who will allow of it in ſome Caſes; yet own that they contract, retire within the Fleſh, are cicatrized there, and ſo ceaſe from their Office of conveying Blood to that Part.</p>
            <p>There are alſo ſome, that after they have been prevail'd upon to acknowledge the Poſſibility of their Re-union; yet ſtill object againſt the Inconveniencies of Bandages, which muſt neceſſarily be continued for ſeveral Days.</p>
            <p>But when theſe Objections have been anſwer'd by ocular Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they'l undertake to prove, that the Blood in the Arteries, and that of the Veins, does not in the leaſt differ in their component Parts; and that both being continued Tubes, it matters not out of which the Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation is made. Whereas there is no greater difference between the Fluid contain'd in the Lympheducts and Nerves, than between that in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0202400900:19"/>the Veins and Arteries: that of the Arteries being of a more lively, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, ſcarlet Colour, more ſubtil and ſpiritous, and the Vehicle that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys the Alimentary or Nutritious Particles, which in their progreſſive Motion, preſs upon thoſe Glands whoſe Pores are adapted to admit of ſuch Juices as ſerve either for Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, Nutrition, or Reparation: whereas the Venal being only the Refuſe of thoſe Secretions, returns to the Heart, that ſo by filling its Coronary Veſſels and Ventricles it may be enabled to perform its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Contraction and Dilatation, which, if its Reflux be intercepted by Bandages, it muſt neceſſarily be depriv'd of, and conſequently ſuch Effects are produc'd as before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. So that this Objection is as trifling and frivolous as the reſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe being ſo eaſily anſwer'd, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother unanſwerable Objection is ſtarted, <hi>viz.</hi> That that Branch, which we durſt attempt to draw Blood from, is ſo ſmall, as not to admit of a plentiful Diſcharge.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0202400900:20"/>
            <p>But the moſt powerful Argument to anſwer all theſe Objections, is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. I've us'd this Method in all Caſes where diminiſhing the Quantity of Blood is requir'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Apoplexies, Quinancies, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the Lungs, Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Aſthma's; in all ſorts of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whether intermitting, continual, or malignant, without the leaſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Accident attending it. But this Precaution muſt be uſed, that it be ſuch an Artery as immediately paſſes over a Bone, which are none but thoſe of the Head; and of theſe the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Artery</hi> is the Principal, it being the moſt conſiderable Branch of the Carotid, which paſſing over the <hi>Os Temporale,</hi> admits of a double Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. This may be open'd with leſs Danger, and with far greater Succeſs than any Vein; and I've frequently ſeen it run with as continu'd a Stream, as from the Arm.</p>
            <p>By this time there's no room to doubt but the chief Difficulties are remov'd; and becauſe ſo few are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to this Operation, I ſhall juſt mention how 'tis perform'd;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0202400900:21"/>which is thus. Preſs your Finger on the Veſſel, above the place where you deſign your Aperture, and your Thumb on the ſaid Veſſel beneath, to keep the Skin ſmooth, and the Veſſel from rolling; then introduce your Lancet, raiſing up its Point to cut thro the Veſſels and Teguments, but not by Punction, as too many do in opening the Veins; by which means you may make as plentiful a Diſcharge as you pleaſe, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liable to the afore-mention'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that attend Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy.</p>
            <p>After which, you have nothing elſe to do than to place your Thumb on the Orifice, and preſs it againſt the <hi>Os Temporale;</hi> ſo that if a Throm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſhould ariſe, 'tis ſoon diſpers'd, and in a few Minutes the Lips of the Orifice will unite. This done, you may either uſe a Pledgit of Lint with a Plaiſter, or if you pleaſe, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs with the circular Bandage, which is ſufficient without the leaſt Occaſion of Styptics.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0202400900:22"/>
            <p>This Aperture gives an immediate Check to the impetuous Velocity of the aſcending Blood; which by the Syſtole or Contraction of the Heart is projected to the Head by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotids and Vertebral Arteries, and by means of their Semilunary Valves prevent its Return to the Heart by the ſame Veſſels; ſo that in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant it relieves the Patient, without preventing the Blood, Lymph, and Nervous Fluid, from performing their circular Tour, which by Ligatures muſt neceſſarily be intercepted.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe ſeveral Springs ſend out as many Rivulets, which after various Turnings and Windings unite and form a River, which is receiv'd in a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; wherein an Engin is fix'd, which, with its repeated projectile Force, throws the Water into ſeveral Tubes, in order to be convey'd to and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all Parts of a City: now ſhould there be an Obſtruction in the Pipes, the Engineer may as well expect to remove it by diverting and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Water in the Rivulets, by a different Current, as a Phyſician may expect to remove an Obſtruction
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0202400900:23"/>in the Arteries, by ordering bleeding out of the Veins.</p>
            <p>But there is no occaſion to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Similies to prove what is ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obvious.</p>
            <p>'Tis the part of a Phyſician to aſſiſt Nature, by obſerving nicely the various Steps ſhe takes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe the Enemy. <hi>Natura curat Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos,</hi> ſays <hi>Celſus.</hi> The Dogmatiſt, that can reaſon learnedly on a Diſeaſe, but has not throughly conſider'd the Nature of it, and the Method of Cure, falls far ſhort of a meer Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyric, who practiſes only by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience without any Foundation of Learning; ſo that 'tis not the being a learned Philoſopher, an accurate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſt, that entitles a Man to be a great Phyſician. That ſucceſsful Practitioner, Dr. <hi>Radcliff,</hi> never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to any of theſe Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nay took a Pleaſure to diſown his Knowledg in them; but who in his time ſo happy to ſtrike at the Root of a Diſtemper!</p>
            <p>The Father of Phyſic, <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> when the Art was in its Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, eſpecially that part of it, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0202400900:24"/>how ignorant was he of ſome Parts of Learning, that the Moderns glory in, and value themſelves upon? as appears from the confus'd Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he gives, that the Veins take their Riſe from the Liver: and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Artery, he means the <hi>Aſpera Arteria;</hi> and then calls the Ureters Veins, and makes a Jumble of Nerves, Veins, and Arteries. But then who ſo great and ſucceſsful a Practitioner ever before or ſince?</p>
            <p>Tho I'm not unſenſible that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authors have touch'd on this Subject, yet what firſt induc'd me to the Opinion of <hi>Arteriotomy,</hi> was, that I don't remember ever to have read or heard of Women liable to Apoplexies, unleſs from Poiſons, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piates, or Miſmanagement of ſome foregoing Diſtemper. For however Authors differ in their ſeveral <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes</hi> laid down to account for the Periodical Purgations of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whether this menſtruous Blood offends in Quantity or Quality, it matters not to my preſent Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but whenever this Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is raiſed, whether Natural,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0202400900:25"/>Periodical, or provok'd by <hi>Emena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,</hi> it occaſions an Aperture of the Mouths of the Vaginal Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and not of the Veins.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Haemorroides,</hi> or Piles, by ſome vitious Ferment irritating the tender Fibres of the Arteries, by them is diſcharged incredible Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Blood. <hi>Borellus</hi> relates a Story of a certain Tailor, who loſt Ten Pounds by thoſe Veſſels, and yet recover'd.</p>
            <p>How many Inſtances have we had of profuſe <hi>Haemorrhagies</hi> of the Noſe? <hi>Bartholin</hi> mentions one who bled forty eight Pound in three Days, without the Loſs of Life. 'Tis well known that bleeding at the Noſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves Obſtructions and Pains of the Head, whether proceeding from an Ebullition or Redundancy of Blood. And whence is this Diſcharge but by an <hi>Anaſtomoſis,</hi> or Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous disjoining of the Capillary Arteries, occaſion'd by a convulſive Contraction of the Coats of a larger Artery? which muſt neceſſarily give an extraordinary Diſtention to the next, till the Blood can be no longer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0202400900:26"/>contain'd, but burſts out with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity, even to Pounds; whereas a few Ounces, diſcharg'd by the Veins, has thrown the Patient into Faintings, Swoonings, and occaſion'd even Death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now ſince indulgent Nature is ſo clear in her Dictates, points out an exact Method how we may free her from the Inſults of the common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, <hi>Diſeaſes;</hi> 'tis unreaſonable we ſhould not fall in with her Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>By this time I hope any unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd Reader will be reconcil'd to <hi>Arteriotomy,</hi> and not be byas'd by Cuſtom to prefer that of <hi>Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> preceding, the next Intention is exhibiting <hi>Emetics;</hi> which from Obſervation I ſhall prove to be ſo far from relieving the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, that it proves very pernicious.</p>
            <p>For before the Vomit is adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, 'tis eaſy to ſuppoſe to what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the Glands of the Brain are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, and perhaps the Sanguiferous Veſſels and Lymphatics burſt. This
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0202400900:27"/>extravaſated Blood and Lymph diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd into the <hi>Sinus's</hi> of the Brain, and there coagulated and lodg'd: what Relief can poſſibly be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from an Emetick, which is dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to their former Intention of bleeding out of the Jugulars? For in this there is ſome colour of Reaſon to expect the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the Obſtruction; from that there's no room to hope for any thing but a Confirmation of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper; nor truly in any other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, unleſs when the principal Seat is in the Stomach and Inteſtines, to diſcharge the morbific Matter, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the <hi>Primae Viae.</hi> Then an Emetic is not altogether unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; tho even then other Meaſures may be taken leſs hazardous, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually advantageous. But in this Caſe: Vomits are as contrary to true Practice, as this Operation to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the Fibres of the Stomach being ſo diſpos'd, as to diſcharge its Contents through the Inteſtines: but by theſe irritating Vomits the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm, Intercoſtals, and Muſcles of the lower Belly are ſo ſtimulated,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0202400900:28"/>that by means of their violent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, they force 'em thro the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophagus: for what with the violent convulſive Motion of the aboveſaid Muſcles, together with the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Organs of Reſpiration, the Blood is precipitately hurried and projected to the Brain with that Force as to increaſe the Extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How then it is poſſible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to expect Relief from it, I can't conjecture. An antient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, ſpeaking of an Apoplexy and its Cure, lays down this as a Rule: <hi>Vomitoria fugienda, ne ſuffocationis pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculum augeatur, et caput repleatur.</hi> Nay, in his Purgatives he would not allow the leaſt Quantity of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it being alſo endued with a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting Faculty: <hi>Antimonium non convenit, cum vomitum ſimul moveat;</hi> ſuch ſort of irritating Medicines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient of themſelves to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Apoplexies.</p>
            <p>And I, for my part, verily believe, that were the Bills of Mortality nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examin'd into, and the Cauſes of thoſe Caſualties ſtrictly enquir'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they would be found more owing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0202400900:29"/>to the irregular Adminiſtration of improper Medicines, than to any peccant Matter in the Fluids, or any external Cauſe whatever.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid I ſhall only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm with two or three Obſervations, and that as conciſely as poſſible.</p>

               <p>There was one Mr. <hi>Roach</hi> of <hi>Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol,</hi> who for a long time had labour'd under an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> attended with a violent Cough till almoſt ſuffocated; but after he had expectorated this viſcid Phlegm, was reliev'd: but the Diſeaſe increaſing, and deſpairing of Relief, he apply'd himſelf to me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me he had been ſo afflicted for many Years, that at Spring and Fall he had very ſevere Fits of the Gout; ſo that what with one and t'other, he was render'd incapable of proſecuting any Buſineſs. I exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Medicines of a warm attenuating kind, to diſentangle and carry off the vitious Matter, promote Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration, fortify the Stomach and Lungs, which effectually compleated the Cure. After which he could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

But ſince my Removal from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> his old Indiſpoſition returning afreſh, he had immediate Recourſe to his former Chip-in-Pottage Doctor, that ſafe Phyſician that never did him any good nor hurt, till he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed that innocent harmleſs Vomit, that extoll'd <hi>Indian</hi> Root, <hi>Ipecacoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> which he had no ſooner taken with a Draught of <hi>Carduus</hi> Tea, but preſently he complain'd of a Dizzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that every thing appear'd to him to have a circular Motion: which he had no ſooner ſaid, but he dropt down dead.</p>

I (being accidentally intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by a Friend, who deſir'd my Advice) prevented his taking away a greater Quantity, but order'd that he might be carry'd home in a Chair; which Motion contributed mightily to a free and uninterrupted Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſomuch that he began to have a regular Pulſe.

But a certain Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary coming, whoſe Advice was more prevalent with the Patient's Friends, adminiſtred a Vomit under the pretence of a Cordial: this not

After which manner he continued in the Hoſpital during the whole Campaign; at the breaking up of which, he was committed to the Surgeon's Care of the reſpective Regiment, till the opening of the next Campaign; and then was again receiv'd into the Hoſpital, in a much worſe Condition than when he left it, being perfectly emaciated, having cruſty Ulcers on the Backs of his Hands, and on his Shin-Bones, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling Venereal Nodes; the Bones alſo carious, ſeveral Abſeſſes form'd on the Head, with fiery Botches or Carbuncles, occaſion'd by the ſharp Cauſtic Lixivious Salts, with which the Blood abounded. He fell under my Care, but all means proving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, he died in a few days. I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0202400900:40"/>indeed ſuſpected his Caſe at firſt to be Venereal; but being a Perſon bearing a good Character, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting he had been at no time converſant with Women, I thought it would be requiſite to endeavour to diſcover from what Cauſe thoſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects aroſe. In order thereto, I firſt reſolv'd to examine the Brain, and had no ſooner made my Inciſion on the Scalp, but I perceiv'd the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> to be foul and carious; which, in taking it off, I found had reach'd not only the inner <hi>Lamina,</hi> but alſo both <hi>Meninges,</hi> and even the Corti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Subſtance of the Brain: in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming which, notwithſtanding there iſſued a vaſt Quantity of <hi>Serum,</hi> yet in the third Ventricle, by the <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula Pinealis,</hi> was lodg'd near a Pint of Lymph, and that ſo very viſcous and ropy as to be deny'd the leaſt Paſſage.

This Diſcovery contributed mightily to my Satisfaction; and 'twas very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0202400900:41"/>that the Train of this poor Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's Misfortunes proceeded not from any Venereal Cauſe, but from thoſe Falls and Bruiſes he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly receiv'd; which when Nature was indulged, the Spirits buoy'd up, the Fibres firm and elaſtic, each part could better perform its Function, and ſo prevent the enſuing Diſeaſe: but when reduced to mean Diet and ſcanty Allowance, expos'd to Heats and Colds, inſeparable Concomitants of a Military Life; the Spirits flag and become languid, the Fibres loſe their wonted Elaſticity, and become lax, the Blood loſes its Tone; in ſhort, the whole Animal Oeconomy is ſo diſorder'd, that the vigorous Attack of a Diſeaſe meets with a very feeble Repulſe.

               <p>A certain Gentlewoman of <hi>Ghent</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> accompanying her Spouſe to <hi>Batavia,</hi> of which he was Major Commandant till his Deceaſe, in her Return from thence was taken very ill; for which Indiſpoſition the Surgeon of the Veſſel adviſed her to the Uſe of the <hi>Cold Bath:</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther owing to his Ignorance or her Neglect, ſhe omitted emerging her Head. She was no ſooner got out of the <hi>Bath,</hi> but immediately her Head and Face was ſo ſwoln, as to deprive her both of Sight, Speech, and the Uſe of all her Limbs. At her Arrival at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> Conſultations were held by the beſt Phyſicians concerning her Caſe, with very good Succeſs as to the abating the Swelling of her Head, and Recovery of Speech; but as for retrieving the Uſe of her Limbs, ſhe found no manner of Benefit, but remain'd void of all Senſe and Motion. Thus deſpairing of Help, ſhe return'd to <hi>Ghent,</hi> and apply'd her ſelf to the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0202400900:43"/>Phyſicians of the <hi>French</hi> Hoſpital, who were then in that Gariſon, but with as little Advantage as the former. In this Condition was ſhe for ſome Years confin'd to her Bed, and reduc'd to a meer Skeleton; the Bones of the <hi>Carpus</hi> and <hi>Metacarpus,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> and <hi>Metatarſus</hi> being diſtorted to a Deformity; nay, the very <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langes</hi> of the Fingers and Toes were diſlocated by the Contraction of the Tendons. She then had recourſe to the Town Phyſicians: but neither their Inunctions of penetrating Oils, camphorated Spirits; their Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, or volatile Sudorifics, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and diſcharge this peccant Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that intercepted the nervous Fluid; nor their Decoctions of the Woods, Fomentations or <hi>Hot Baths,</hi> avail'd any thing: of ſhe entertain'd no longer Hopes of being reliev'd.</p>
               <p>But after that Memorable Battle at <hi>Ramillies,</hi> on <hi>May</hi> 23. 1706. the Victory being obtain'd over the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> by that Victorious General, his <hi>Grace the Duke of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> which occaſion'd the ſpeedy Reduction of all the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>

               <p>Her Caſe being very uncommon, and the Succeſs precarious, I could not promiſe much to raiſe her Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; yet being unwilling to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage her, I took my leave with an Aſſurance of conſidering her Caſe, and get the Opinion of other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, whom I conſulted: but their concluding that 'twas a perfect <hi>Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> diſſuaded me from attempting that which was ſo improbable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompliſh'd.</p>
               <p>My laſt Obſervation ſuggeſted to me, that this Numbneſs and Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proceeded from the Obſtruction of the nervous Fluid, occaſion'd by the viſcous glutinous Matter lodg'd in the <hi>Sinus's</hi> of the Brain; which, if it could be diluted by the Power of Medicine, ſo as to be carry'd off by its proper Veſſels, I then thought I
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0202400900:45"/>might expect Succeſs: ſo communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating my Thoughts of her Caſe, and the Method I deſign'd to proſecute for the Cure, to the ingenious Dr. <hi>Laurence,</hi> then <hi>Phyſician General to her Majeſty's Forces in</hi> Flanders, he approv'd of my Method, as the moſt probable to recover my Patient, and eſtabliſh my Character.</p>
               <p>This encourag'd me to undertake the Cure. What fluſh'd me more with Hopes of Succeſs, was, that in a ſhort time her <hi>Menſtrua</hi> flow'd; which before, during the whole time of her Illneſs, were totally ſuppreſs'd: after which, in three Weeks time, ſhe was capable (with the Aſſiſtance of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Arm) to walk to Church, and by degrees acquir'd her former Health and Strength, to the great Surprize of all that knew her deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Caſe. In a ſhort time after ſhe was marry'd, and deliver'd of a ſtrong and healthy Child.</p>
               <p>This confirm'd me in the Opinion, that let a Chronical Caſe be ne'er ſo intricate, 'tis in the power of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines (if rightly apply'd) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, ſuppoſing there's not too

               <p>Here's an Inſtance of an <hi>Apoplexy</hi> from <hi>Laudanum,</hi> which convinces me that its <hi>Narcotic</hi> or <hi>Hypnotic</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty proceeded neither from an occult Quality, or intenſe Coldneſs, either by coagulating or environing the Particles of Blood or Spirits, and ſo preventing their Motion: for ſince by a Chymical <hi>Analyſis</hi> we find it gives a copious Quantity of fetid Oil and Volatile Spirit, it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſutes that Aſſertion of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold; but on the contrary, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the Texture of the Blood, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Humours more fluid, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Spirits into diſorderly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Heart, by its repeated Syſtole, projects the Blood with too great a Velocity to the Brain.</p>

               <p>Some time after having an Affair at the <hi>Bath,</hi> and there meeting with a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, he was prevail'd upon to bathe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but what with ſweating, the Vitriolic, Sulphureous, or Bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Waters, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came faint, heavy, and render'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Lethargic: however relying too much on the Strength of Nature, he neglected the Uſe of Means, till one
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0202400900:50"/>Night being taken with a Contraction of the Nerves, and ſoon after ſeiz'd with a few Convulſive Paroxyſms; I was ſent for the Morning follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and advis'd him to air and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe himſelf with gentle Riding: he no ſooner attempted to riſe, and plac'd his Feet on the cold Floor, but was immediately ſeiz'd with a violent Fit of an Apoplexy, and in a moment became cold, ſtiff, and to all Appearance lifeleſs. At this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Accident, the whole Family ran out to rally ſome of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood to their Aſſiſtance, left me alone, where I accidentally found a ſmall Bottle of Spirits of Harts-horn, which I pour'd down his Throat; and at their Return I deſir'd he might have a Friction all over his Body: which prov'd ſo ſucceſsful, that I ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Pulſation and Reſpiration. I then took Sixteen Ounces of Blood from the Temporal Artery, and in leſs time than ever I obſerv'd from the Arm; after which, I preſcrib'd what I thought proper for his Caſe. Other Phyſicians who were alſo ſent
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0202400900:51"/>for, came, and to my Face approv'd of my Method of treating him, but after my Departure they ridicul'd it as miſchievous and hurtful, ſaying 'twas the only way to draw the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper to, and confirm it in the Head. Whether <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi> had the Aſcendant, or whether equal Parts of both contributed to furniſh their <hi>

Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, after this ſecond Diſcharge he immediately recover'd his Senſe and Speech. At my Return, his Friends inform'd me what had happen'd, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0202400900:52"/>that 'twas owing to thoſe Phyſicians, that they had not ſtrictly obſerv'd my Method; at which being about to leave him, I was prevail'd upon, by his importuning me ſo earneſtly, to tarry. I was entirely of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Veſſels of the Brain were burſt; but however I deſir'd a Conſultation with Dr. <hi>Bave</hi> of <hi>Bath,</hi> and acquainted him with my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, which he approv'd of, and gave him my Opinion of the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateneſs of his Caſe, which he alſo fear'd. But the other Phyſicians, tho their Companies and Opinions were deſir'd, yet thought fit, as they had ſneak'd off, to abſcond, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too conſcious to themſelves of the irreparable Prejudice they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done; giving only this ſhuffling, trifling Excuſe, That truly Dr. <hi>Bave</hi> was ſo ſingular as to conſult with none but ſuch as had been educated at <hi>Oxford;</hi> whereas that <hi>ingenious,</hi> as well as <hi>ingenuous</hi> Gentleman, who is a Credit to the Univerſity where educated, an Advantage to the Town where he reſides, and to ſuch that have Recourſe there for

After ſome Medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, the Doctor returns without entertaining the leaſt Hopes of his Recovery; but the Patient reſting well that Night, his former Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians concluded then he was in a fair way of doing well. I took li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to inform 'em how great Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers they were to his preſent Caſe; and that when they were in the greateſt Expectations of his being out of danger, that then they would have moſt reaſon to fear his being ſnatch'd away: which happen'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; for the very enſuing Night, whilſt jocoſe and merry with his Friends, he was ſeiz'd of a ſudden, and had juſt time allow'd him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath his Soul to God that gave it, and ſo expir'd, ſnorting and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vaſt Quantity of Livid Blood from his Noſtrils.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0202400900:55"/>that in the ſpace of three Hours he became very ſenſible; and amongſt ſeveral Phyſicians that were mention'd to him, he was pleas'd to ſend for me, inform'd me of his manner of being ſeiz'd, that he was then very Coſtive, and had a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Urine; but the Pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not very irregular, I defer'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Artery: ſo at that time I preſcrib'd only <hi>Laxatives</hi> and <hi>Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,</hi> and took my leave, deſiring him to acquaint me at the firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the returning Fit; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the following Morning at Four a Clock: at which time the Fit was ſo exceeding ſevere, that he was almoſt ſuffocated, and his Face diſcolour'd like one ſtrangled: the Artery being then turgid and quick (as it always is in thoſe Caſes) I immediately took away about Sixteen Ounces, which I had no ſooner done, but he ask'd me what I was doing. I order'd him to be rais'd out of his Bed (being there too much confin'd) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd into a more airy Room; which occaſion'd him to make Water very
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0202400900:56"/>plentifully: But after a ſtrict Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I found that the Concuſſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Brain, and the Symptoms attending it were ſuch, that the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels muſt neceſſarily be broke, and that there was but ſmall Hope left to expect his Recovery; which I freely told his Friends, they being very preſſing with me to give my real Sentiments, and deſirous of a Conſultation, which for their Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I approv'd of. So they ſent for Dr. — at Four in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who, notwithſtanding he had given his Word of Honour to be immediately there; yet, after his uſual way, kept 'em in expectation till Eleven, at which time aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his uſual haughty Air (to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate himſelf into the Opinion of the Vulgar) he enters; but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd who was above, in order for a Conſultation, this brazen Oracle turns on his heel, and pronounces theſe Words, <hi>With this I conſult, and none elſe,</hi> pointing to his Breaſt, the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> being equally as well furniſh'd with Brain, as the <hi>Cranium.</hi> But tho he was mightily reflected on for this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0202400900:57"/>imperious Air, 'tis every Perſon's Duty to judg charitably, and put the moſt favourable Conſtruction that 'twill bear: I for my part would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to an innate Modeſty, being conſcious of his Ignorance in that Caſe; and that offering his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, would be but expoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without the lead Service accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Patient: <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> ſuiting no more his Genius, than <hi>Cook</hi> or <hi>Littleton.</hi> But not to harp too long on ſuch an untunable String, I'll wave this, heartily wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (for the Benefit of thoſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate diſtemper'd Perſons that fall under his Care) that for the future he may have better Succeſs, than from his Knowledg in the Faculty of Phyſic can reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>I continu'd in the Uſe of proper Means, but for the Reaſons before mention'd could not expect his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; for tho to appearance he was much better, yet the next day about Eleven in the Forenoon, he fell into a cold clammy Sweat, and for the Space of almoſt an Hour ſhorted
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0202400900:58"/>exceſſively, foam'd at the Mouth, and expir'd.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps may ſay this might have as well been omitted as inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Patient dying; but this may ſerve to confirm my Aſſertion, that <hi>Arteriotomy</hi> is ſo much preferable to <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> there being no Parallel Inſtance, that ever the latter had ſo ſpeedy an Effect to recal the Senſes.</p>

               <p>I ſhall only add one Inſtance more of the Miſmanagement of Diſeaſes, and the irregular Adminiſtration of Medicines, and conclude. 'Twas on the famous <hi>William Penn</hi> Eſq; who being of a <hi>Plethoric</hi> Habit of Body, and <hi>Lethargic,</hi> was one day ſeiz'd with Convulſions at his Table, and falter'd in his Speech: immediately their Family Phyſician was ſent for, who took the uſual Method of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, till at length it terminated in an <hi>Intermitting Fever,</hi> which was ſo ill manag'd, that 'twas ſix Weeks before he could be removed to his Country Houſe. Being at <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſix Months after, he was ſeiz'd with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0202400900:61"/>Fit of the ſame kind, but much more ſevere: a Learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician was then employ'd, who, ſcorning to jog on in the old beaten <hi>Lane,</hi> Pack-horſe like, was more pompous in his Preſcriptions; as appear'd by ordering his <hi>Antilethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic</hi> or famous <hi>Cephalic</hi> Powder, which by virtue of an occult Quality, (could it but have inſinuated it ſelf into every Crevice of the <hi>Cranium</hi>) would have work'd Wonders: but theſe <hi>Circumforaneous</hi> Scouts want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Parole,</hi> could not paſs, the Ports of the <hi>Os Crebriforme</hi> being ſo well guarded with <hi>Nerves, Veins, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,</hi> and ſo cloſely lin'd with <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes;</hi> ſo that this <hi>Specific</hi> Powder not anſwering Expectation, this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman left him, who after ſome moderate days Journeys arriv'd at his Country Seat at <hi>Ruſcomb</hi> near <hi>Reading,</hi> where he was ſeiz'd with a third Fit. Their Phyſician was then ſent for from <hi>London,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted his former Method, only with this difference, that he order'd Cupping, Scarifying; and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the ſtrongeſt <hi>Epiſpaſtics,</hi> this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0202400900:62"/>barbarous Treatment caus'd diſmal Stranguries; and the little Urine he made was with great Pain and much Difficulty, and of a bloody Tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, intermix'd with coagulated Matter, reſembling Lumps of Fat, ſo large, that 'twould be thought incredible to paſs the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra.</hi> By this Severity (tho entirely owing to a good Conſtitution) he was not kill'd, yet it confirm'd a <hi>Hydrocepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> or Dropſy in his Head, which caus'd a ſenſible Decay thro all Parts of his Body, depriv'd him of his Speech, and the uſe of his Senſes: and in this deſponding State the Doctor left him.</p>
               <p>All which Misfortunes might have been prevented by bleeding in the <hi>Artery,</hi> at the firſt Appearance of the Diſeaſe, and falling in with my Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures before mention'd.</p>
               <p>I was then ſent for, and ſucceeded ſo Well, that in a few days he was apparently better; ſo I left him to the Care of his Apothecary, and in about ten days time paying him a ſecond Viſit, I found him quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man: he had reaſſum'd his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0202400900:63"/>wonted Briskneſs and Alacrity; and thus continu'd for ſome Months in a very good State of Health, till this unhappy Accident: having two Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels betwixt the <hi>Scapula's,</hi> on one of which a Protuberance roſe like a Boil, which threw him into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fever; this Tumor encreas'd to a prodigious Size, extending it ſelf from the lower Angle of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> all over the <hi>Clavicle.</hi> My being ſent for to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to viſit an antient La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (who had formerly been my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and beſt <hi>Benefactrix</hi>) oblig'd him to make uſe of the former Phyſician, and a <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Surgeon: but a Friend of Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> being very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with me, I waited on him with all Expedition, found they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Cataplaſms</hi> in order to bring it to Suppuration, and had attempted to lay the <hi>Abſceſs</hi> open, but thro Fear had only ſcratch'd the Teguments. I then took the Probe, and introduc'd it eight or nine Inches, and made a deep Inciſion, from whence a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Quantity of <hi>Pus</hi> diſcharg'd it ſelf. Then I order'd a Digeſtive to deſtroy whatever <hi>Fungus</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0202400900:64"/>main; by which means he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately freed from the Fever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Occaſion of being cramb'd with <hi>febrifuge</hi> Draughts, Powders, and <hi>Bolus's</hi> that lay ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully prepar'd for him; ſo I left him to the Care of a Surgeon in <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> an ingenious Man, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Cure effectually: and now he enjoys as large a Meaſure of Health as ever.</p>
               <p>This Operation of <hi>Arteriotomy,</hi> that the Generality are ſo timerous and cautious of attempting, I've not only perform'd and order'd for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dults, but even on Infants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. One particularly who fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Care, was the Child of a diſtemper'd Parent, who as ſoon as born was attended with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and at ſix Weeks old was ſeiz'd with one ſo violent, that none had the leaſt room to hope for Life: but at the taking away a ſmall Quantity of Blood from the <hi>Artery,</hi> the Child was in an inſtant reliev'd, look'd chearful, pleaſant, and immediately took the Breaſt, which for ſome time before the Fit
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0202400900:65"/>he had refus'd, and ſo with the Uſe of proper Medicines perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd.</p>
               <p>This Treatiſe I don't doubt but will meet with ſome who will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, as well as other preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd Perſons that will be as ready to contemn and condemn it. But what I've writ was entirely owing to a Senſe of my Duty to my Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creatures, without either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the Applauſe of the former, or valuing in the leaſt the malicious Cenſures of the latter.</p>

            <p>MY Bookſeller having aſſur'd me, that a Book without an Appendix is like a Play without an Epilogue, I immediately addreſs'd my ſelf to write one; but the Difficulty was, to fix on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, among ſo many as offer'd themſelves to my Thoughts. At firſt I reſolv'd to demonſtrate that the <hi>Animalcula</hi> did not enter the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> till they had impregnated one of the <hi>Ova</hi> in the <hi>Ovaria;</hi> and when there maturated, fall from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Tubae Fallopianae,</hi> and laſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Womb.</hi> Then I thought I would expoſe (as the Practice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) the uſe of Oils, Syrups and Diuretics in Diſtempers of the Stone, and confirm my Opinion by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Obſervations, ſhowing that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0202400900:67"/>ſuch Applications generate the Stone, but never diſſolve or carry it off; and inſtead of Syrups, Oleaginous and Tartarous Liquids, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Uſe of Malt Liquors: and at the ſame time to ſhew that Gravel is not producd from any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the Kidneys, but a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the Bowels ariſing from Indigeſtion. At another time, I thought it would be no unuſeful thing to the Town, to demonſtrate that the Conſumptions, which we frequently meet with, ariſe not from any Tendency in Nature, but from the miſchievous Effects of improper and ill-apply'd Medicines in venereal Caſes.</p>
            <p>While I was thus in ſuſpence, a Book caſually fell into my hands, of <hi>Obſervations on Bezoar-Stones, with a Vindication of Sugars,</hi> &amp;c. in which I ſaw there was copious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to remark upon: but finding in it a Letter from Dr. <hi>Cooke</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which extols this new Chalk Medicine above all others, I ſhall confine my ſelf to that part of the Book, and ſhow the World, by a few Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0202400900:68"/>how little this Medicine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Praiſes given it.</p>

               <p>Mrs. <hi>Paget,</hi> the Wife of a noted Man in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> had for many Years been afflicted with the Cholick and Stone, but ſmall ones, and at ſome Seaſons of the Year more violent than others. Under this Misfortune ſhe apply'd to Dr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings, who in vain us'd their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Medicine, with their Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum Doſes, till ſhe was brought upon a Rack, and continud ſo for ſix or ſeven Months. I being ſent for (and being appriz'd how ſhe had been us'd) gave her ſome things of a warm attenuating Nature, by the Help of which ſhe diſcharg'd vaſt Quantities of a hard compact Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that was generated in her Stomach, with much Choler and Bile. Afterwards ſhe had an Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion downwards of great Numbers of Stones that were hardned in the Bowels, occaſion'd by this Chalk mixing it ſelf with the Flame in the Stomach; by which means they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0202400900:69"/>were lapify'd by the Heat of the Liver, as Chalk will be before the Fire when mix'd with Water. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſecond Application, many more came away, ſome ſmaller, and ſome greater. The third time ſhe diſcharg'd one as large as a big Walnut, which I have now by me, and which ſhows where it was faſtned to the <hi>Ductus Bilearius,</hi> and the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows made by the Periſtaltic Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Guts; and by pricking of it you bring out the very Chalk, as appears from mixing it with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that gives a Colour like other Chalk. From that moment ſhe was reliev'd from all Complaints; and falling aſleep for ſome hours, ſhe wak'd perfectly refreſh'd. I us'd ſome things which I thought proper to recover the Tone of her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> She now enjoys a good State of Health, and has continu'd well ever ſince.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0202400900:71"/>Fruit, and taking Cold, ſhe fell into an intermitting Fever with a Cough. In which Caſe ſome officious Friends (as ſuch are never wanting) prevail'd with her to put her ſelf into the hands of Dr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and ſome of his Underſtrappers, well enough known in the City; who giving her (<hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Conſuetudinem,</hi> but not <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Artem</hi>) Chalk, Milk, and <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum</hi> Draughts, the Diſtemper gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Strength (as how could it do otherwiſe) and the abus'd Patient threw up great Quantities of Chalk and curdled Milk together; the Cauſe inſtead of the Cure of her Diſeaſe.

Upon Diſcourſe with her Mother, I perceiv'd the Doctor had been there again after me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his Medicine, which in a few Hours threw her into ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions as ended in Death.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s Wife being ill of a Complication of Diſtempers, had at length, by the Care of Dr. <hi>Cook</hi>'s Creatures, a fix'd Pain in her Back, in ſo much that if ſhe ſlip'd her Foot by Accident againſt any thing, ſhe would fall down as dead with the Agony of the Pain. I being ſent for, took the ſame Method which I us'd with Mrs. <hi>Paget;</hi> that is, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangled a vaſt many little Stones that had petrify'd in her Bowels, and upon the <hi>Ductus Bilearius:</hi> which was no ſooner effected, than ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd

               <p>By this Obſervation it appears how eaſily the Miſapplication of Medicines deſtroy the Conſtitution, and the chief Faculties of Procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; from whence I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that there is neither Man nor Woman, but who is qualify'd to procreate, or might be made ſo: Of which I could produce Inſtances more than a few, if it were proper.</p>

               <p>Captain <hi>Scot</hi>'s Wife of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an infirm Woman for many Years, and being treated in the ſame manner as the Perſons before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, was at length thrown into a Jaundice and Scurvy, with a Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of her Limbs, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Strangury; in which deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State ſhe continu'd for ſeven Years, and then fell into a Dropſy all over her Body. It was then I was call'd, and by taking Methods ſutable to the Dictates of Nature, as I have always done, and by the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0202400900:76"/>Grace of God ever ſhall, ſhe was ſo wonderfully reliev'd, as to be able to walk a Mile to her Dinner, who could not before move out of her Chamber. I follow'd theſe happy Beginnings with ſuch Preſcriptions as brought her to a perfect State of Health; ſo that ſhe has been ſeveral times ſince at <hi>London.</hi> Upon the whole matter I would obſerve, that the Fault lies not in the Medicines ſo much as in the unskilful Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them; and particularly I affirm, that I have made uſe of the <hi>Bezoar</hi> and <hi>Gaſcoin Powder</hi> with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Succeſs, and have found it to be the beſt of Cordials. Until there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dr. <hi>Slare</hi> gives a few Inſtances of the pernicious Effects of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar Stone</hi> and <hi>Gaſcoin Powder,</hi> for the many I have produc'd of his admir'd Chalk, and many more that I can; I hope he will allow me (at leaſt I ſhall allow my ſelf) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the former.</p>

               <p>Captain <hi>James Grant,</hi> of Brigadier <hi>Grant</hi>'s Regiment, had a Fever and Ague after the Battle of <hi>Mons</hi> to a violent degree, and receiv'd no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from the Bark; but had his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for ſix Hours in twelve: at length being brought in a Litter to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> he fell under my Care. I gave him ſome things proper to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangle and carry off the Load of Matter which oppreſs'd his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and then waited for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his Fit, which, as I expected, was more moderate than before. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, I preſcrib'd the Bark, and told him, with ſome Aſſurance, that his Fit ſhould return no more; which, tho he did not in the leaſt believe, yet he found it to be true. Thus it is plain, that it is of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that a Medicine be a good one, unleſs it is apply'd in a proper Caſe, in a due Manner, and when the Patient is fitly prepar'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to receive it.

            <p>THE Conſideration of Graſs for Beaſts, leads me to Corn; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Staff of Life for human Kind; of the four Grains, Wheat, Rye, Barly, Oats; of each of theſe Bread may be made very wholeſom and good. It is true, if you chew and eat any of theſe, they do not give ſo ſignal a Sweet to our Taſte, as what is really contain'd in them, and will ſoon be made to exert that Sweetneſs. For Example, if you do but wet any of theſe Corns in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, you will ſtir up ſome active inherent Principles, which will ferment and ſwell the Grain, and make it to grow (as the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters call it.) This gives them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſpreading it abroad to dry, which may be done in the Sun; but for Conveniency is perform'd on a Kiln, by the Admiſſion of Heat from the Fire made beneath it. This is now call'd Malt; if you eat a Grain or two, you will diſcern it to be ſweet; if you boil it in Water (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has been powder'd or ground)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0202400900:80"/>it will give a ſweet Tincture, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd Wort; you may boil it to the Conſiſtence of a Syrup: And this Product of Corn ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with Melloſſus, which if it be ſpread upon Bread, it adds conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Nouriſhment to your Bread, and would be eſteem'd a good Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and pleaſant Entertainment, did we not abound with ſo many other more refin'd and dainty Sweets, and eaſier to come at. Thus Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus is commonly given to School-Boys with their Bread; nor can I think it bad Food for Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more miſchief may be due to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their new ſpungy or dowy, and not well baked Bread, than to the <hi>Indian</hi> Sweet. It is this ſweet Decoction of Malt that makes your great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of fine Ales and Beer, much more wholeſom, more pleaſant and fit for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bodies, than your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd Wines, whether <hi>Rheniſh, French,</hi> or <hi>Florence;</hi> for theſe do abound with gritty, tartarous Matter, very apt to lodg in the Kidneys, and lay the Foundation of the moſt intolerable Diſtemper in the World, the Stone;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0202400900:81"/>or if they be ſo happy to eſcape that, the Gout will make an Attack on the Joints of the Toes or Fingers of a potent Drinker, and tear and ſwell the tender Parts, and ſometimes mercifully thruſt out thoſe <hi>Tophi</hi> or Stones into the extream Parts, which otherwiſe would probably have been caſt upon the too ſenſible and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Kidneys: but none could ever charge our ſoft and balſamick Ale with breeding any ſort of ſandy or tartarous Matter in the Barrel, and I think not in the Body. I cannot forbear mentioning an Obſervation of my good Friend Dr. <hi>Cyprianus,</hi> who told me long ſince, he had cut above fourteen Hundred Perſons for the Stone, but never obſerv'd that he cut any Ale-houſe Keepers, but many Vintners. He always advis'd his Patients that fear'd the Stone, or were concern'd with that excrucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Diſeaſe, to drink ſoft Ale, the newer the better: for he condemns moſt or all four Juices, as apt to breed the Stone, or increaſe it.</p>

            <p>I Receiv'd your kind Letter and the Manuſcript, of which I cannot give an adequate Encomium. It is an impartial Trial and Condemnation of <hi>Bezoar</hi> by the Laws of Chymiſtry, Reaſon, and Experience. Oh how uſeful might our Profeſſion be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to the Poor, as well as to the Rich, if all the chargeable part of our <hi>Materia Medica</hi> was thus exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd fairly; and whatever appear'd inſipid, inodorous, unactive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolvable in mild Menſtruums and very gentle Heats, ſhould be judged unworthy to be depended on for the Cure of Diſeaſes! The Reformation of the Errors and Cheats of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialiſts would be a very great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Mankind, who are too often in as much danger from the true <hi>Terra damnata</hi> of Medicine, as from thoſe Diſeaſes which Quiet and

But to return to your moſt accurate Analyſis of this falſe, tho celebrated and precious Antidote, I will read it over once or twice more; for it will afford ſtill freſh Delight to me, who can ſcarce forbear interceding with you, that
