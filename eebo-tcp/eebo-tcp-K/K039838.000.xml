            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Whoſe ſhadowy marvels Learning loves to boaſt,</l>
            <l>Shew not, in civic glory's favourite days,</l>
            <l>Pleaders more worthy of a People's praiſe.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0331500900:31"/>When by rapt Greece Demoſthenes was heard,</l>
            <l>And thunder ſeem'd leſs potent than his word;</l>
            <l>The ſtormy paſſions of revenge and ire</l>
            <l>Ting'd his bright language with intemp'rate fire:</l>
            <l>When Tully, deſtin'd to the Grecian's doom,</l>
            <l>Pour'd forth philippics to applauding Rome;</l>
            <l>Perſonal hate, with patriot virtue warm,</l>
            <l>Gave force and fury to his verbal ſtorm.</l>
            <l>Theſe heroes of the hot forenſic ſcene</l>
            <l>Blended with public zeal their private ſpleen:—</l>
            <l>Not ſo the Pleaders who this verſe inſpire,</l>
            <l>Who merit paeans, from a nobler lyre:</l>
            <l>As free from virulence, as void of fear,</l>
            <l>In conduct graceful, as in motive clear.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0331500900:32"/>They paid juſt homage to preſiding Law,</l>
            <l>With manly deference, and decent awe.</l>
            <l>No ſelfiſh pride, in which light minds rejoice,</l>
            <l>Rais'd to victorious ſway their temp'rate voice:</l>
            <l>But England's welfare, on their heart impreſt,</l>
            <l>Pure public virtue, glowing in their breaſt,</l>
            <l>Arm'd their juſt ſouls with intellectual force,</l>
            <l>To check Authority's vindictive courſe,</l>
            <l>And turn Deluſion's tide in Danger's hour,</l>
            <l>Reckleſs of frowns from Prejudice and Power.</l>
            <l>ERSKINE and GIBBS! whoſe names, to Nature dear,</l>
            <l>Ages unborn may grateſully revere;</l>
            <l>While this memorial of your worth I raiſe,</l>
            <l>And firmly credit what I fondly praiſe;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0331500900:33"/>One hateful truth ſhall Mem'ry dare ſuggeſt,</l>
            <l>Grav'd on the deep receſſes of her breaſt:</l>
            <l>Rudely ſhe teaches, from her ample range,</l>
            <l>That Public Virtue is moſt apt to change.</l>
            <l>The faithful hand, that theſe frank lines ſupplied,</l>
            <l>Ne'er laviſh'd incenſe by the heart belied;</l>
            <l>But, with fond zeal to court in joyous youth</l>
            <l>A public idol of imagin'd truth,</l>
            <l>Has oft diſcarded an unfiniſh'd taſk,</l>
            <l>Finding Apoſtacy in Virtue's maſk;</l>
            <l>For ere my fingers could the garland weave,</l>
            <l>Like that our hapleſs Father twin'd for Eve,</l>
            <l>It dropp'd, and all its faded roſes ſhed,</l>
            <l>Scorning to garniſh an Apoſtate's head.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0331500900:34"/>But may this civic wreath, in eager haſte</l>
            <l>Form'd of wild flowers, by Merit's ſmile be grac'd!</l>
            <l>For lives preſerv'd unqueſtionably due,</l>
            <l>(The nameleſs donor proves the tribute true;)</l>
            <l>Bays from Sincerity's obſcure retreat</l>
            <l>May cheriſh Virtue in Contention's heat.</l>
            <l>Ye, to whom England owes a pleaſing debt,</l>
            <l>That Engliſh gratitude ſhould ne'er forget;</l>
            <l>Thus Freedom prays, to recompenſe your care,</l>
            <l>Deign, righteous Heav'n! to ratify the pray'r:</l>
            <l>"Live my firm aids to life's ſereneſt end,</l>
            <l>Friends to each other, each the people's friend;</l>
            <l>Live beyond life of Briton's glory part,</l>
            <l>Enſhrin'd for ever in the public heart!"</l>
