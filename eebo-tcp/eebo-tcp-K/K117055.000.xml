            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S to the <hi>Original</hi> of this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scourge of Mankind call'd the <hi>Plague,</hi> I find the moſt learned <hi>Phyſicians</hi> are much divided in their <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions</hi> concerning it, and thoſe who have ſearched ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far into the Secrets of <hi>Nature</hi> do yet ingenuouſly acknowledge themſelves to be very much at a loſs about it. The great Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> freely and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſes his <hi>own</hi> and his <hi>Brethren's</hi> Ignorance in this Matter, and that not without a <hi>Smart</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon ſuch as pretend to know more than their Neighbours, in this and other Particulars of the ſame abſtruſe Nature. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 2 d. <hi>Page</hi> 71. of his Works, he thus expreſſes himſelf. <hi>At verò quae, qualiſque ſit, illa aeris Diſpoſitio à quâ mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bificus hic apparatus promanat, nos, pariter ac com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plura alia circa quae vecors ac arrogans Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantium

            <p>I muſt here indeed freely own that I am much pleaſed with the <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi> of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and diligent <hi>Diemerbroeck,</hi> who after a large Recital and Examination of the ſeveral <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> that had been advanced before his Time concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Origine of the <hi>Plague,</hi> and after weighing the Arguments and Reaſons brought by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Patrons for the Support of them, declares himſelf wholly diſſatisfied with them all, in the eight Chapter of his firſt Book and the Annotations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and after all, he has Recourſe to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the great <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> (the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,</hi>) and endeavours to make it appear that ſomething ſupernatural or preternatural is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood thereby, and that <hi>That</hi> ancient <hi>Sage</hi> (tho' guided only by the Light of natural Reaſon) inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſignifie by that Term, ſomewhat ſent down from angry <hi>Heaven,</hi> as a juſt Puniſhment for the Wickedneſs of Men.</p>
            <p>But it may not be improper to add ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this <hi>Head</hi> from that great <hi>Chriſtian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> and (while he lived) illuſtrious <hi>Ornament</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> never to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned without a Preface of Honour. This <hi>Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>Critical,</hi> but <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Modeſt</hi> Enquirer into the Powers of <hi>Nature,</hi> and Operations of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes,</hi> in his Occaſional Diſquiſition concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Plague,</hi> wiſely chuſes the middle Way, between thoſe who recur wholly to ſupernatural <hi>Cauſes,</hi> and thoſe who impute all to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Ones,</hi> in their Accounts hereof: He obſerves,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1235100200:6"/>in his <hi>Experimental Diſcourſe</hi> concerning the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalubrity</hi> and <hi>Salubrity</hi> of the <hi>Air, Page</hi> 50. &amp;c. That the <hi>Sacred Writings</hi> expreſly teach that ſome <hi>Plagues</hi> have been in an extraordinary Manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by <hi>God,</hi> particularly <hi>That</hi> which in <hi>David's</hi> Time ſwept away in three Days <hi>Seventy Thouſand</hi> Men. But <hi>He</hi> ſeems to think that it is carrying the Matter too far to infer from hence, or to affirm po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively that <hi>All</hi> are ſo. <hi>I have ſometimes ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (ſays he, Page 52.) <hi>that in the Controverſie concerning the Origine of the Plague whether it be Natural or Supernatural, neither of the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties is altogether in the Right, ſince 'tis very poſſible that ſome Peſtilences may not break forth without an extraordinary Interpoſition of Almighty God, provoked by the Sins of Men; and yet other Plagues may be produced by a tragical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of merely natural Cauſes.</hi> But we are not to think that by this laſt Expreſſion <hi>He</hi> meant to exclude the Superior Agency or Superintendency of the <hi>Firſt</hi> in any <hi>Caſe;</hi> for no <hi>Man</hi> can expreſs a more becoming and awful Senſe of, or an higher Reverence for the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Cauſes,</hi> than <hi>this</hi> great <hi>Genius</hi> does in all his Writings; and I could heartily wiſh that <hi>He</hi> were more generally imitated herein by the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> of the preſent <hi>Age,</hi> and that a more explicit Reference to <hi>Divine Providence</hi> were to be found in all their Reſearches into <hi>Nature:</hi> And I cannot but hope that it would very much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute hereunto, if our Modern <hi>Wits</hi> would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly read and conſider that excellent <hi>Treatiſe</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Chriſtian Virtuoſo,</hi> written by this <hi>Noble Author.</hi> But to return from this (I hope not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful) <hi>Digreſſion:</hi> As to Mr. <hi>Boyle's</hi> Opinion concerning the Riſe of <hi>Ordinary Plagues,</hi> it is in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1235100200:7"/>ſhort <hi>This: He</hi> inclines to think that the <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> whereby the <hi>Plague</hi> is propagated, if not firſt produced, is imputable to ſome Kind of <hi>Subterraneal Expirations,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to <hi>Arſenical Fumes;</hi> but as to this <hi>He</hi> is far from being Poſitive, or Dogmatical: What <hi>He</hi> offers to render this Conjecture probable, they that pleaſe may ſee, in his <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> as to its Unhealthfulneſs or Healthfulneſs, already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Thus far as to the <hi>Origine</hi> of the <hi>Plague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the Learned Dr. <hi>Mead</hi> advances, about the Beginning of <hi>Page</hi> 4. of his Diſcourſe, in theſe Words; <hi>[Nor do I think that in this Iſland particularly, there is any one Inſtance of a Peſtilential Diſeaſe among us of great Conſequence, which we did not receive from other Iufected Places:]</hi> is perfectly agrecable to the Opinion of the celebrated <hi>Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who obſerves, that to the evil Diſpoſition of the <hi>Air,</hi> which proceeds (according to <hi>Him</hi>) from a latent unknown <hi>Cauſe,</hi> there muſt be joyned the Reception of ſome <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>Infection</hi> flowing from ſome <hi>Plaguy</hi> Body, and received either <hi>immediately</hi> by a near Approximation to it, or elſe <hi>mediately</hi> by the Means of ſome <hi>Fomes</hi> tranſmitted thencefrom into ſomething apt to receive and retain the ſame, and transferred therewith to diſtant Places; until by the great Number of infected Bodies, the <hi>Air</hi> receives ſuch a <hi>Taint,</hi> [or rather is ſo charged and loaded with <hi>Poiſonous Particles</hi>] as ſuffices to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the <hi>Contagion</hi> to ſome Diſtance, without any other Spark to kindle the ſpreading Fire. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this may be ſeen in <hi>Page</hi> 72. of his Works.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 7. the <hi>Doctor</hi> briefly mentions that moſt terrible <hi>Plague</hi> which carried <hi>Death</hi> over the greateſt Part of the then known <hi>World,</hi> about the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1235100200:8"/>Middle of the fourteenth <hi>Century,</hi> the Hiſtory of which being very remarkable (eſpecially if all the Circumſtances related by <hi>Authors</hi> of conſiderable Note be true) I ſhall preſent the Reader with a ſomewhat larger <hi>Narrative</hi> of it, as very proper to affect us with a pious Awe and Fear of the Wrath and Vengeance of a righteous <hi>God,</hi> and alſo to give us a melancholy and humbling Repreſentation of the horrid <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of humane Nature, and the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Obſtinacy of irreclaimably <hi>Wicked Men.</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in <hi>Page</hi> 69. of the forementioned Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe has given a brief Account of this prodigious <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> from that excellent French Hiſtorian <hi>Mouſieur de Mezeray,</hi> who (as he tells us) relates in the Life of <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> that the <hi>Plague</hi> which happened in <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1346, was ſo Contagious and Deſtructive, that ſcarce a Village or even a Houſe eſcaped uninfected by it: <hi>He</hi> adds, that this <hi>Peſtilence</hi> began two Years before in the Kingdom of <hi>Cathay,</hi> by a Vapour that was moſt horribly ſtinking, which brake out of the Earth like a Kind of <hi>Subterraneal Fire;</hi> and devoured above 200 Leagues of that Country, even to the very Trees and Stones, and infected the <hi>Air</hi> in a wonderful Manner: From <hi>Cathay</hi> (ſays he) it paſſed into <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> thence into <hi>Africa,</hi> afterwards into <hi>Europe,</hi> which it ranſack'd throughout. Thus far Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> from <hi>Mezeray,</hi> in whoſe Account the Date of the Year ſeems to have been miſtaken, or 1346 miſprinted for 1348, or 1349. For by Dr. <hi>Mead</hi>'s and the following Account, it began in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thay,</hi> (the Northern Part of <hi>China</hi>) in 1346.</p>
            <p>Beſides what I have quoted from Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> I ſhall entertain the Reader with a more Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Relation of this moſt fearful Calamity which I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1235100200:9"/>met in <hi>Kircher's Chronology</hi> of the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Plagues</hi> that are recorded in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> annexed to his <hi>Scrutinium Phyſico-Medicum contagioſae Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, quae Peſtis dicitur.</hi> The <hi>Subſtance</hi> of what he writes is this; That in the <hi>Poutificate</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixth, <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth being <hi>Emperor,</hi> there raged a moſt cruel <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> the worſt that ever was, ſcarcely the third Part of Mortals being left alive. It ſo prevailed every where, that <hi>God</hi> ſeemed as if he would deſtroy all Mankind by a general Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, as of old in the univerſal <hi>Deluge. Villanius</hi> tells us that it had its firſt Riſe in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Aſia,</hi> and particularly in the Kingdom of <hi>Cathay,</hi> in the Year 1346, from a moſt filthy Smell ſuppoſed to proceed from a certain <hi>Fiery Body,</hi> which either fell from <hi>Heaven,</hi> or broke out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and extended its horrible and terrifying <hi>Bulk</hi> to ſo vaſt a Compaſs, that it conſumed every thing that ſtood in its Way, Animals, Houſes, Trees, &amp;c. for the Space of fifteen Days Journey: And ſome moſt filthy lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Beaſts</hi> furniſhed with Feet and Tails, [by this Deſcription they ſeem to have been a Sort of <hi>Neuts</hi> or <hi>Lizards</hi>] as alſo <hi>Worms,</hi> and a ſmall Sort of <hi>Snakes</hi> in a numberleſs Multitude, fell at the ſame Time from the Air upon the Earth, the Stench and Putrefaction whereof infected the whole <hi>Region.</hi> A <hi>Peſtilence</hi> hence ariſing invaded the adjacent Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and then ſpread it ſelf to the remoter Cities and Provinces, ſo that it depopulated all <hi>Aſia.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it penetrated into <hi>Egypt, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Thence it paſſed over into <hi>France, Spain</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and at length into <hi>Germany, Poland</hi> and all the <hi>Northern Parts,</hi> with the Deſtruction of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Perſons. In the City of <hi>Florence</hi> only, <hi>Villanius</hi> ſays there periſhed 60000, but St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>

            <p>This moſt fearful <hi>Plague</hi> is alſo taken Notice of by many other <hi>Chronologers. Alſtedius</hi> relates that at <hi>Lubeck</hi> it carried off 90000. And that of the Bare-footed <hi>Monks</hi> in ſeveral Parts it deſtroyed ſo great a Number that in the whole their Dead amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to 1244434; and the ſame Particular is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Hogelius</hi> in his <hi>Horologium Hiſtoricum,</hi> Page 632. who tells us alſo, that at <hi>Erford</hi> there died ſuch Multitudes that the burying Places in the City being all fill'd with Carcaſes, 12000 were laid in eleven Caves under the <hi>Mountain</hi> called the <hi>Red Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> Page 650.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1235100200:11"/>of the later Ones particularly deſcribed by Learned Phyſicians, as That at <hi>Delft</hi> in 1557 by <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> That at <hi>Vicenza</hi> by <hi>Maſſaria</hi> in 1576, That at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> in 1636 by <hi>Diemerbroeck,</hi> and the laſt very terrible One at <hi>London</hi> in 1665 by <hi>Hodges,</hi> which they that pleaſe may conſult.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 11. towards the End, the <hi>Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> juſt mentions the Opinion of ſome who have thought that the <hi>Peſtilential Contagion</hi> or <hi>Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is propagated by the Means of <hi>Inſects,</hi> whoſe <hi>Eggs</hi> may eaſily be conveyed from Place to Place, and produce the Diſeaſe when they come to be hatched: But he obſerves withal that this is a <hi>Suppoſition</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon no manner of <hi>Obſervation,</hi> and that there is no Need to have Recourſe to it. As to this <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of poyſonous <hi>Inſects</hi> giving Riſe to the <hi>Plague,</hi> it has been lately inſiſted on by Mr. <hi>Bradley,</hi> who in his <hi>new</hi> (and indeed very ingenious and uſeful) <hi>Improvements of Planting and Gardening</hi> Reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here, has publiſhed a Letter from Mr. <hi>Robert Ball</hi> containing ſeveral curicus Obſervations which ſeem to him to render it highly probable; and in a ſmall Tract lately publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Bradley,</hi> the Title of which is, <hi>The Plague at Marſeilles conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> he has purſued the ſame <hi>Conjecture,</hi> and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of what is to be found in the <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Letter</hi> already mentioned upon the Head of <hi>Inſects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Notion ſeems to be much a-kin to that which was advanced by <hi>Athanaſius Kircher</hi> (that famous <hi>Enquirer</hi> into Nature, ſufficiently known to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned World by his Voluminous Labours) in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Century,</hi> and he ſeems to have taken the Hint from the noted <hi>Cardan,</hi> for in <hi>Page</hi> 52. of his <hi>Scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Peſtis,</hi> he tells us, that <hi>Cardan</hi> relates that in his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1235100200:12"/>Time (who flouriſhed about the Middle of the ſix-teenth <hi>Age</hi>) there was a moſt cruel <hi>Peſtilence</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> ariſing (as he conjectures) from an infinite Number of little Worms: Of theſe <hi>Vermiculi Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> diſcourſes very largely in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Plague,</hi> bothbefore and after thenowmention'd Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from <hi>Cardan;</hi> and particularly in <hi>Page</hi> 141. he ſpeaks of the <hi>Plague</hi> as ſomething which he hadſhewn to be <hi>Animated,</hi> becauſe of thoſe <hi>Animalcula</hi> which hetakes to be often, if not always, the <hi>Seminary</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, concerning which he thus expreſſes himſelf; <hi>Sunt autem hi Vermiculi Peſtis propagatores, tam exigui, tam tenues et ſubtiles, ut omnem ſenſûs captum cludant;</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Subſtance</hi> of what he ſays is this; That theſe little <hi>Worms</hi> which he ſuppoſes to be the <hi>Spreaders,</hi> if not wholly the <hi>Breeders</hi> of the <hi>Plague,</hi> are ſo exceeding <hi>Small</hi> that they are to the Senſe and Sight imperceptible and undiſcernable, unleſs it be by the Help of the moſt exquiſite <hi>Microſcopes,</hi> and for their Smalneſs may be called <hi>Atoms,</hi> but they encreaſe ſo prodigiouſly that their Numbers are beyond Compute. Theſe <hi>Vermiculi,</hi> as they are generated <hi>(Ex putredine)</hi> out of Corruption, ſo they are eaſily thruſt forth by all the Pores of the Body in which they are, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſweaty <hi>Vapours,</hi> and are carried along with the ſlighteſt Motion of the Air in vaſt Swarms, like the Motes that may be ſeen plying to and fro in the Sun Beams, when they ſhine into a Room that is ſomewhat obſcure thro' a Hole. Theſe <hi>Inſects</hi> (he ſuppoſes) do tenaciouſly adhere to any Thing they meet with, and inſinuate themſelves into the ſmalleſt Pores of Bodies; and to render all this more probable, he ſays, that he has oft found the <hi>Blood</hi> taken from Perſons labouring under <hi>Putrid Fevers</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1235100200:13"/>ſo full of <hi>Worms,</hi> within an Hour or two after the Emiſſion, as even aſtoniſhed him, from whence he perſwades himſelf that <hi>Man</hi> may (not only after his Death, but even) while alive be plentifully ſtored with ſuch Vile <hi>Animalcules,</hi> tho' the Senſe cannot diſcern them, and that, on this, as well as other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks as he does. <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.14 <hi>[I have ſaid to Corruption thou art my Father: to the Worm thou art my Mother and my Siſter.]</hi> He goes on to ſhew that this <hi>Verminoſe Brood,</hi> which (according to his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) is caſt forth in very great Quantity both from the <hi>Living</hi> Bodies of ſuch as are infected with the <hi>Plague,</hi> and from the Carcaſes of the <hi>Dead</hi> when they begin to putrifie, being received into the innermoſt Parts of Linen and Woolen Cloaths, and the like, are there cheriſhed, and therewith conveyed to diſtant Places, and that this is the firſt and principal <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> of the whole <hi>Contagion;</hi> as he endeavours to ſhew more at large: But ſuch as deſire further Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as to this Particular, muſt have Recourſe to the Book it ſelf, for it would require much more Time and Room, than can be allowed at preſent but to make an Abridgement of his copious Diſcourſe about it in ſeveral Parts of the ſaid Treatiſe. This <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> muſt be acknowledged very plauſible and ingenious, if it be built upon a ſolid Foundation, and if ſuch <hi>Vermiculi</hi> as theſe have a real Exiſtence <hi>in Rerum Naturâ,</hi> and be not the Creatures of aſtrong Imagination only. That there are <hi>Worms</hi> very often found in Humane Bodies is indeed ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident, and what none are ignorant of; and that <hi>Worms</hi> have been ſometimes vomited up by Perſons ſick of the <hi>Plague</hi> is atteſted by Authors of good Credit: <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> mentions one Inſtance of this Kind, <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 52. Page 306. where he relates
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1235100200:14"/>this Particular concerning a <hi>Patient</hi> of his, that he caſt up by Vomit above 60 ſmall <hi>Worms</hi> as red as Blood, ſoon after which he died; but he adds that he never ſaw the like in any other Perſon. We are alſo told that Multitudes of ſuch <hi>Worms</hi> were found in ſome dead Bodies that were opened at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> which lived and moved very briskly when put into <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Brandy,</hi> but were ſoon killed with <hi>Oyl</hi> and Juice of <hi>Lemons;</hi> yet after all, <hi>Kircher's Vermiculi</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ball's</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bradley's Inſects</hi> do not ſeem to be of the ſame Species with theſe <hi>Worms,</hi> for the former are repreſented as ſo many animated <hi>Atoms,</hi> ſcarcely diſcoverable by the Help of the beſt Glaſſes, whereas the latter were ſufficiently obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous both to the Sight and Touch. For my part I ſhall not go about to determine any Thing in this Matter, but ſhall leave it to the nicer Examination of the moſt Learned <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> who are capable of penetrating much farther into the Myſteries of <hi>Nature</hi> than I can pretend to be. Only I cannot forbear adding that I do very much doubt while theſe <hi>Inſects</hi> (which by the way can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the ſame with Mr. <hi>Bradley's Blighting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects,</hi> for then we ſhould have a <hi>Plague</hi> every Time we have a <hi>Blight,</hi> which in and about this Place is almoſt as oft as we have a Spring, as the <hi>Gardeners</hi> know to their Sorrow, by the ſo frequent Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Fruit: I ſay I do much doubt, while theſe <hi>Inſects</hi>) remain in ſuch an inviſible State, the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that is founded upon them will alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main precarious, and as little demonſtrable as others that have been formerly propoſed. To which I ſhall ſubjoin this one Remark more; That the Generation of <hi>Worms</hi> or any other <hi>Animals, ex putredine,</hi> which <hi>Kircher</hi> ſeems to take for granted, is now almoſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1235100200:15"/>univerſally exploded, and no ſuch Thing as <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous</hi> or <hi>aequivocal</hi> Generation allowed to the meaneſt <hi>Inſect:</hi> but 'tis agreed among the Learned, that the ſmalleſt Creatures do (as well as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt) proceed <hi>ex Semine,</hi> and have <hi>Parents</hi> of their own Kind by whom they are propagated; and this indeed is what Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> no where denies, and I do not ſay but that his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> may be conſiſtent with the <hi>univocal</hi> as well as <hi>aequivocal</hi> Generation of ſuch <hi>Animalcula.</hi> Yet give me Leave to obſerve once more, that the gradual Progreſs which the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> uſually makes, does not ſeem very well to agree with the exceeding Lightneſs of theſe volatile <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects,</hi> and upon conſidering this Circumſtance one would be enclined to imagine, that whatever is the <hi>Fomes</hi> of the <hi>Contagion,</hi> it muſt be ſomething more <hi>ponderous,</hi> tho' no leſs <hi>poiſonous</hi> than theſe <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Inſects</hi> are ſuppoſed to be; and I cannot well conceive how it would be poſſible by all the Care or Precaution in the World, to prevent the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Diſtemper from one End of a Countrey to the other, in a very ſhort Space of Time, if it be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about by theſe <hi>Nimble, Light-heel'd, Living A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,</hi> who would make nothing of flying over <hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> or faſtning upon the Men themſelves that ſtand to guard the <hi>Paſſes,</hi> and in ſhort, muſt go which Way ſoever they are carried by every <hi>Puff</hi> of Wind or <hi>Stream</hi> of Air. But I ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt further at preſent upon this or any other Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that occur to my Thoughts with Reference to this <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> I ſhall leave theſe little <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> to ſhift for themſelves as well as they can, but if they be ſuch <hi>Plaguy</hi> ones as they are repreſented, I deſire to have no experimental Acquaintance with them, tho' I own that the Notion and Speculation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1235100200:16"/>of them may be agreeable enough to an inquiſitive <hi>Genius;</hi> and the Objections which lye croſs in my Mind againſt this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Plague-producing Inſects,</hi> may poſſibly be anſwered to Satisfaction by the Patrons of it, how inſoluble ſoever they may at preſent appear to me.</p>
            <p>What the Learned <hi>Doctor</hi> ſuggeſts in Page 22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt the old but unhappy Cuſtom of <hi>ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> up Infected <hi>Houſes,</hi> is ſo <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and ſupported with ſuch <hi>Solid Reaſons,</hi> that I cannot but hope it will be ſo far attended to by our wiſe <hi>Legiſlators</hi> in all future <hi>Regulations</hi> they ſhall ſee fit to make, that ſuch a cruel and hurtful Method may be effectually prevented, and that if at any time it ſhould pleaſe <hi>God</hi> to viſit us with that ſore <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> the <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> of it ſhall not be augmented by Treating the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Sufferers</hi> with ſuch <hi>unreaſonable</hi> rigour as manifeſtly tends to ſink and overwhelm their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (which ought to be kept up as much as poſſible, as in other <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> ſo more <hi>Eſpecially</hi> in this) and to diſpoſe them for nothing (humanely Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) but to <hi>Deſpair</hi> and <hi>Die.</hi> And I cannot doubt but that ſuch timely Proviſion will be made by the <hi>Publick,</hi> of convenient <hi>Lazarettoes</hi> for the Reception of the <hi>Sick</hi> upon the firſt breaking ſorth of the <hi>Dire Diſeaſe</hi> in any large <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Town,</hi> as may (through the Bleſſing of <hi>Heaven</hi>) prove an happy Means of ſtopping the <hi>Progreſs</hi> thereof in its beginning.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Alternative</hi> which the <hi>Doctor</hi> propoſes in the cloſe of his <hi>excellent Performance</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>infected Goods,</hi> that if they be not <hi>burned</hi> they may be <hi>buried</hi> deep in the <hi>Ground;</hi> I cannot but think the <hi>Latter</hi> of theſe Methods, (or the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And if this Method of <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> be ſo pernicious in the Caſe of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> I doubt there is too much Ground of fear (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common way of arguing <hi>à Minori ad Majus</hi>) that it may prove ſtill more fatal in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1235100200:18"/>Caſe of the <hi>Plague;</hi> But this I humbly ſubmit to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Learned in Philoſophy and Phyſick.</p>
            <p>As for proper <hi>Prophylacticks</hi> or <hi>Preſervatives</hi> from the <hi>Plague,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> has not offered much upon this Head, and ſeems to deſpair of the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of any Specifick of vertue ſufficient to fortifie nature againſt the aſſaults of ſuch a <hi>Malignant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</hi> After the mention of ſome general and very uſeful rules to be obſerved by way of prevention, and juſt hinting at a few particulars, eſpecially the uſe of <hi>Wine Vinegar</hi> in ſmall quantities, [which, with his <hi>Conſerva me Domine,</hi> is ſaid to have been the <hi>Antidote</hi> of the famous <hi>Sylvius</hi>] <hi>He</hi> does in the 35. Page, recommend leaving the infected place as the <hi>Sureſt Preſervative,</hi> which is the ſame with the Counſel that <hi>Ramazzini</hi> gives in his late Diſſertation concerning the <hi>Plague</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> about ſeven Years ago; Page 469. of his Works; where he thus expreſses himſelf. <hi>

If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing could be found out that would, if not always, (which indeed is not to be expected) yet pretty often prove a <hi>Defenſative</hi> againſt this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Enemy,</hi> it would certainly be a great and moſt acceptable Service to Mankind to acquaint the world therewith. But as to this, I (being no <hi>Phyſician</hi> my ſelf) have little to offer but what has occaſionally occurred to me in peruſing ſome of the beſt <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Books, written by <hi>Authors</hi> of the greateſt Name and Note, who have themſelves been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Practitioners,</hi> and particularly have had cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough to Viſit the Sick in places where the <hi>Plague</hi> has raged with the greateſt Violence.

It would take up too much room to tranſcribe the half of thoſe Receits, which he propoſes from himſelf and others by way of prevention, in his Treatiſe of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1235100200:20"/>I ſhall therefore only give my Reader the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what he ſets down in the 12 Ch. of his 2d.

[the Compoſition of which ſhall be ſubjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Account] That beginning to viſit the Sick between <hi>Four</hi> and <hi>Five</hi> in the Morning, he could then take Nothing, his Stomach perfectly loathing both Meat, Drink, and Medicine, ſo that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained (though againſt his own Judgment) to go forth faſting, and could do no more than (after committing himſelf to <hi>God</hi> by pious Prayers) to chew ſome Grains of the leſſer <hi>Cardamom;</hi> That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Six</hi> a Clock in the Morning he took a little <hi>Treacle,</hi> or <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> or eat a little <hi>Candied Orange Pill,</hi> and very frequently three or four Bits of <hi>Candied Elecampane:</hi> About <hi>Eight</hi> he break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted upon a Peice of <hi>Bread</hi> with <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheeſe</hi> made of Sheeps Milk, drinking a Glaſs of Ale, and now and then (but not daily) he took a Draught of <hi>Wormwood Wine</hi> about <hi>Nine:</hi> At <hi>Ten</hi> he ſmoaked a Pipe of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> and after Dinner <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three,</hi> and the like after Supper, and ſometimes <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> more between Meals, and if at any Time he found himſelf affected with the <hi>Ill Smell</hi> of the Sick, he preſently had Recourſe to the ſame <hi>Remedy,</hi> which he ſays (he found by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) as well as always thought to be the moſt effectual <hi>Preſervative,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Tobacco be of the beſt Sort.</hi> He adds, that upon the ceaſing of the <hi>Plague</hi> he left off <hi>Smoaking,</hi> not willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom himſelf to it, leſt he ſhould turn its laudable Uſe into a deteſtable Abuſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Compoſition</hi> of the <hi>Anti-peſtilential</hi> Pills is as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take the Roots of Butter-bur, Carline Thiſtle, Dittany, Angelica, Elecampane, of each an½Ounce; and Half; of Gentian one Dram and Half; of the beſt Rhubarb, one Ounce and Half; of Zedoary one
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1235100200:22"/>Dram: Of the whiteſt Agarick, Half an Ounce; Take alſo the Herbs Scordium, the leſſer Centory, Rue, of each Half an Ounce; Carduus Benedict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, ſix Drams; and of the Flowers of Staechas one Dram and an half; as alſo the Seeds of Citron and Oranges, of each one Dram; of all theſe make a groſs Powder, which ſteep for two or three Days in two Pounds and an half or three Pounds of White Wine, then boil it for about a Quarter of an Hour, and ſtrain it very ſtrongly in a Preſs, and afterwards ſtrain itagain through thin Paper: In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve three Ounces and an half of the beſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, and three Drams and an half of clear Myrrh in Drops: Let the Moiſture evaporate in a China Diſh 'till a Maſs of Pills can be made of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder.</hi> Theſe Pills (ſays the Author) we have found to be of great Uſe in Time of the <hi>Plague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far from the accurate <hi>Diemerbroeck;</hi> who has alſo given us no leſs than 120 <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of ſo many particular Perſons afflicted with the <hi>Plague,</hi> in whoſe Caſes may be ſeen all the various <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms</hi> of that ſore Diſtemper, with the Remedies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to each of them, which are well worth the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of ſuch as underſtand the Language wherein they are writ.</p>
            <p>Proceed we now to the Learned Dr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> who by the Appointment of the <hi>Government</hi> continued in <hi>London</hi> during that moſt dreadful <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> which raged there in the Year 1665, of which he afterwards publiſhed an <hi>Hiſtorical Narration</hi> with the <hi>Title</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or an <hi>Account of the Plague:</hi> in which he treats concerning the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Progreſs,</hi> the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Signs,</hi> and <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Contagion,</hi> and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates his own Manner of living in that Time of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. What I ſhall obſerve from him ſhall be only
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1235100200:23"/>the few particular Directions which he gives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch Things as he judges proper to be done by Way of <hi>Precaution;</hi> omitting the general Ones relating to the timely providing <hi>Lazaretto's,</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Streets clean,</hi> and the like, which Dr. <hi>Mead</hi> has perfectly well recommended. As to particular <hi>Preſervatives</hi> from the <hi>Plague,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hodges</hi> gives us ſeveral <hi>Receits,</hi> of which I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down <hi>Two</hi> that are of eaſy Preparation, and perhaps of equal Virtue with the more pompous Forms. The firſt is what he calls an <hi>Electuary for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Poor,</hi> the Compoſition of which is in <hi>Page</hi> 229, of his Book, <hi>viz. Take Conſerve of Wood-ſorrel and Goats Rue, of each half a Pound; of Marigolds, one Pound; London-treacle, three Ounces; Bole Armoniack vitriolated, four Ounces; with Syrup of Lemons as much as is ſufficient; make an Electuary; two or three Drams of which may be taken Morning and Evening.</hi> The other is an <hi>Hauſtus</hi> ſaid to be of great Virtue. <hi>Viz. Take Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of red Roſes camphorated two Ounces, the beſt Vinegar one Ounce, in which diſſolve two Scruples of the beſt Bole Armoniack; add three Drams of ſimple Syrup of Scabious, mix them for a Draught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do the rather mention this becauſe the Uſe of <hi>Vinegar</hi> ſeems to be much approved by the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Dr. <hi>Mead. Diemerbroeck</hi> alſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and ſays that he had ſeen many poor People better preſerved by taking a <hi>Spoonful</hi> thereof every Morning, than ſome Others were by the moſt coſtly <hi>Remedies.</hi> Page 170.</p>
            <p>Among other <hi>Antidotes</hi> againſt the <hi>Peſtilential Contagion,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hodges</hi> does particularly commend <hi>Canary</hi> of the beſt Sort, of which he frequently drank while he attended the Sick, and found it of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1235100200:24"/>Uſe to himſelf and others. His Time of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was at <hi>Dinner,</hi> and a little before <hi>Bed-time;</hi> but as to the <hi>Smoaking</hi> of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> which <hi>Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broeck</hi> ſo much extols, <hi>He</hi> ſpeaks very doubtfully of it, and ſeems to have had an Averſion to it, and to ſuſpect that the <hi>Peſtiferous Vapours</hi> may be ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in with the <hi>Smoak;</hi> and in fine he prefers his good <hi>Spaniſh Wine</hi> very much before it, and this ſo far as appears was the <hi>Antidote</hi> he chiefly truſted to among the <hi>Internal</hi> Ones. But then as to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Defenſatives againſt this deadly Enemy (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the many <hi>Amulets</hi> vulgarly preſcribed, the moſt of which he thinks to be uſeleſs, and ſome noxious,) there is one which he greatly commends as the moſt powerful and effectual of all others in this Caſe, and that is the having of large <hi>Iſſues;</hi> for Inſtance, one in the <hi>Left Arm,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Right Leg,</hi> capacious enough to contain five or ſix Peaſe. The more to enforce this Advice, he does ſolemnly affirm, <hi>Page</hi> 240. that as oft as he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Places that were more than ordinarily <hi>Infected,</hi> he found that Part of his <hi>Arm</hi> in which the <hi>Iſſue</hi> was, exceedingly pained, and that <hi>thin, undigeſted, Bloody Matter</hi> would flow from it, with a very ſmart Pungency, and that upon this Warning given him, he preſently had Recourſe to proper <hi>Alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks.</hi> It ſeems plain from hence even to Senſe and ocular Demonſtration, that the <hi>Virus,</hi> the <hi>Venom,</hi> and <hi>Poiſon</hi> of the <hi>Contagion</hi> did work off in a great Meaſure by Means of this Sort of <hi>Evacuation.</hi> I ſhall only add under this <hi>Head,</hi> that <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> does alſo much commend this Remedy, and obſerves that many who had <hi>Iſſues</hi> eſcaped the <hi>Plague at Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen,</hi> and of thoſe that had it, a conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber recovered ſpeedily upon taking a <hi>Sweating
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1235100200:25"/>Medicine,</hi> and he mentions ſeveral other eminent <hi>Phyſicians</hi> that had found the happy Effect of ſuch <hi>Iſſues</hi> in the Courſe of their <hi>Practice.</hi> Page 150. <hi>&amp;c. He</hi> obſerves alſo that many of thoſe that had <hi>Sores</hi> about them eſcaped the <hi>Plague,</hi> and he tells us that <hi>Galen</hi> of old made the Same <hi>Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now in the Cloſe of this <hi>Collection</hi> juſt mention <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two Preſervatives</hi> recorded by the Excellent <hi>Mr. Boyle,</hi> towards the latter end of his diſcourſe of the <hi>Air</hi> beforementioned. The former of theſe is in Page 86. which was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him by one whom he calls an ancient and very experienced <hi>Phyſician,</hi> to whoſe care a great <hi>Peſt-houſe</hi> was committed. This <hi>Perſon</hi> own'd to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> that beſides ardent <hi>Prayers</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and a very regular diet, his conſtant <hi>Antidote</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take every Morning faſting a little <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> diſſolved in a few Spoonfuls of <hi>Fair Water:</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> adds that he thinks it deſirable that Notice be taken of all Remedies that have been found by good <hi>Trials</hi> available againſt the <hi>Plague;</hi> for ſince <hi>Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences</hi> are various in their Kinds, 'tis very poſſible that their appropriated Remedies may be ſo too; and that Medicine may prove ſucceſsful in one, which has proved ineffectual in another. The <hi>Noble Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> adds to this, That the ſaid Conſideration for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him to paſs by the following Particular, <hi>Viz.</hi> That a very Learned <hi>Phyſician</hi> having recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him the Herb called <hi>Galega,</hi> or <hi>Goats-rue,</hi> at that time little noted in <hi>England,</hi> as a moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt the <hi>Plague,</hi> he cauſed it to be cultivated in a Garden, and when the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> raged moſt, having ſome of it by him made up with a little <hi>Sugar</hi> in the form of a <hi>fine green Conſerve,</hi> he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1235100200:26"/>ſent it to <hi>Two</hi> infected Perſons, who, by the divine bleſſing on it, both of them recovered. He alſo takes notice of the great vertue of this <hi>Herb</hi> againſt the <hi>Bitings</hi> of <hi>Venomous Creatures:</hi> It may be eaten in its entire Subſtance as a Salad, or the <hi>Conſerve</hi> or <hi>Syrup</hi> may be taken, or the <hi>Juice</hi> newly expreſs'd, which he thinks better than the <hi>Syrup</hi> or <hi>Conſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have finiſhed what I had to offer to the <hi>Publick</hi> concerning the <hi>Plague,</hi> and the moſt proper <hi>Antidotes</hi> againſt it which I have met with in my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reading. I ſhall only add, That after all, our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal-Truſt and Confidence muſt be in the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> through the Merits of our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns all <hi>Perſons</hi> to ſearch and try their ways, and turn unto the <hi>Lord</hi> with their whole hearts. Let the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments</hi> or <hi>Second Cauſes</hi> of this terrible Calamity be what they will; whether it owes its <hi>Origin</hi> to <hi>Subterraneal Steams</hi> and the <hi>Expirations</hi> of Noxious <hi>Minerals,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> conjectures) or, to a peſtiferous <hi>Aura,</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a peculiar, and (in a Sort) corruptive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the <hi>Nitro-aereal</hi> Spirit, (as Dr. <hi>Hodges</hi> thinks) or, to prodigious <hi>Swarms</hi> of inviſible <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Inſects,</hi> (as <hi>Kircher</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) Or <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to an unhealthy Conſtitution of the Seaſon, and Diſorder in the <hi>Air</hi> Occaſioned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Moiſture,</hi> (as <hi>Galen</hi> taught of old) which evil Conſtitution is heightned and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more Malignant by the Stinks of <hi>Stagnating Waters,</hi> by <hi>Putrid Exhalations</hi> from the <hi>Earth</hi> and from dead <hi>Carcaſes</hi> lying unburied, which fill the <hi>Air</hi> with <hi>Contagious Particles,</hi> and ſo being <hi>Suck'd</hi> in with the <hi>Breath</hi> taint in their paſſage the <hi>Salival</hi> Juices, which being Swallowed down into
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1235100200:27"/>the <hi>Stomach</hi> fix the <hi>Malignity</hi> there, as the Learned Dr. <hi>Mead</hi> obſerves, Pag 7. and 11. of his Diſcourſe: I ſay whether this <hi>Dreadful Diſeaſe</hi> owes its <hi>Origine</hi> to any one, or (which is more probable) to a <hi>Concurrence,</hi> and <hi>Complication</hi> of <hi>Secondary Cauſes,</hi> Yet ſtill it becomes us to look higher, and to reverence <hi>Divine Providence</hi> as the firſt and principal <hi>Cauſe.</hi> The great <hi>God</hi> has ſaid, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>[Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?] Sword</hi> and <hi>Famine</hi> and <hi>Peſtilence</hi> are what <hi>He</hi> expreſly calls, <hi>His ſore Judgments.</hi> (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.21.) The <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Fire,</hi> the <hi>Air,</hi> all the <hi>Elements,</hi> and all their <hi>Actions</hi> are at his <hi>Beck,</hi> and under his ſteady <hi>Government,</hi> and 'tis not improbable that he does employ <hi>Angels,</hi> as the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to inſlict deſerved <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> and particularly this of <hi>Peſtilence</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a guilty People: Poſſibly he may by their <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> Hands ſcatter through the <hi>Air</hi> thoſe fatal <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmata,</hi> thoſe Malignant <hi>Venomous Atoms,</hi> and <hi>Poiſonous Effluvia,</hi> the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Contagious</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, that carry <hi>Death and Deſtruction</hi> all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round; to which Thought ſome <hi>Divines</hi> have been led by ſome paſſages in <hi>Holy Writ</hi> that ſeem in their opinion to look this way. Be this as it will, 'tis certain that the <hi>Almighty</hi> is the principal <hi>Agent,</hi> who orders and over-rules all <hi>Inferiour ones,</hi> and therefore whatever or whoever be the <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> 'tis with him that we have chiefly to do, 'tis from him that we have more to <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Hope</hi> than from all the <hi>World</hi> beſides, and therefore it muſt needs be both our Duty and our Intereſt to fly to his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Seat,</hi> to <hi>Humble</hi> our ſelves before him, and to make our earneſt <hi>Supplication</hi> to him, either to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> us from ſuch <hi>Publick</hi> deſolating Calamities,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1235100200:28"/>or to <hi>prepare</hi> us for them. And a general <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> is one of the moſt hopeful Means of <hi>Preſervation</hi> from this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> whereby the <hi>Wrath</hi> of an <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God</hi> is revealed from <hi>Heaven</hi> againſt the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs</hi> of a guilty World. Yea, if <hi>God</hi> ſhould ſee fit to ſend it among us, ſuch <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Amendment,</hi> joined with a true <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Mediator,</hi> would beſt prepare us for it, give us the greateſt Courage and Comfort under it, and the moſt happy Iſſue out of it, and even <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf would be to us no other than a Paſſage to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Life.</hi>
