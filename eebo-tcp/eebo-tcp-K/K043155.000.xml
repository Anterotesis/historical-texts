            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Sir Liſtleſs Lounge, with well-bred yawn, declares,</l>
               <l>He dreads encount'ring your election bears;</l>
               <l>What with the toil of canvaſſing, he vows,</l>
               <l>And making ſpeeches when one's in the houſe,</l>
               <l>So much of rights, and liberties they rave,</l>
               <l>In theſe free ſtates a man's a downright ſlave!</l>

               <l>To treat of liberty, in our weak lays,</l>

               <p>And to compleat the ridicule, his mother canvaſſes for him. Sure the ſpirit of abſurdity has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended upon our family, and determined we ſhould be a public laughing-ſtock. She would have me with her yeſterday; and ſuch a tramp as we had! She took me through all the filthy alleys in town; then we were obliged to kiſs the children in every houſe we went into, be they never ſo dirty, and keep a pocket full of halfpence to ſlip into her hands; a proof, dear father, of what a bribe can do, when we can purchaſe nothing but a rattle with it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parma.</speaker>
               <p>Why this was mere paſtime to what I have gone through on my canvaſs. I went yeſterday to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit the vote and intereſt of old Smoke Jack, the chimney-ſweeper, and found his whole family ſeated at a banquet of ox-cheek and bacon. I was preſſed to eat you may be ſure; ſo down I ſat between his two eldeſt boys, as he called them, ſo black! that they looked more like two organized bags of ſoot than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings. I ſat clear for ſome time, 'till one of the lads reaching his brother the bread acroſs me, black'd all the ſide of my coat, which, as ill-luck would have it, happened to be cream-coloured. His father, mad at his ill manners, got up to ſtrike him; when the boy, in ſtriving to eſcape, threw me and his brother down, and before I got up I was black enough to paſs for one of the family.</p>

               <speaker>Parma.</speaker>

               <p>He may be returned for the borough of Bribewell, but Belfield has an intereſt in my heart, which no venal candidate can rob him of.</p>

               <p>Grumble as much as you pleaſe, ma'am, but I am determined your marriage articles, and the writs for the new parliment, ſhall be returnable toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I fancy there are ſew who can ſay as much for themſelves as Joe Parmazan. I was bred a cheeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, 'tis true, but what of that? when I have a ſon in the houſe, his cloquence will pare off the rind of my obſcurity. I hope, like his father, be'll have all the blue mold of patriotiſm about him. Let me ſee, how ſtand my morning expences, (<hi>Pulls the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent articles out of his pocket as be names them</hi>) I have above three hundred pounds worth of goods in my pockets, that at a juſt appraiſement would not be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at twenty ſhillings; but election wares are tickliſh articles, and whilſt the fair laſts, keen chapmen will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0589603400:7"/>have their prices. Here's a piece of gingerbread that coſt me five guineas, that I could have bought for a penny at any baker's in London, but no price is thought too high for real parliment cakes. A child's trumpet too! a pretty play-thing this for a man of my age! It coſt me two guineas, and I muſt wait 'till my grandſon is born to blow me a tune upon it. Here's fifty pounds ſlap in a caſe of razors. Theſe razors may ſhave keen, but I think they never will cut ſo cloſe as the fellow who ſold them. Here's a toothpick-caſe, coſt me twenty pounds. If a man was to pay every day in the ſame proportion for his dinner, he might ſoon ſhut up his mouth, and give his teeth a holiday! But oh, monſtrous! in this paper I have a hundred hob-nails, for which I paid a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds down upon the nail; I was nail'd hard in that bargain. Here is ſome Scotch ſnuff, and ſome court ſticking-plaiſter, which coſt me very dear; but I don't mind that, as they are articles which will be of great uſe to the Member when he gets into the houſe.</p>
