            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE fame of Gratian, before he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the twentieth year of his age, was equal to that of the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <note place="margin">Character and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the emperor Gratian. A. D. 379—383.</note> princes. His gentle and amiable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition endeared him to his private friends, the graceful affability of his manners engaged the affection of the people: the men of letters, who enjoyed the liberality, acknowledged the taſte and eloquence, of their ſovereign; his valour and dexterity in arms were equally applauded by the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0034700105:10"/>
ſoldiers; and the clergy conſidered the humble piety of Gratian as the firſt and moſt uſeful of his virtues. The victory of Colmar had delivered the Weſt from a formidable invaſion; and the grateful provinces of the Eaſt aſcribed the merits of Theodoſius, to the author of <hi>his</hi> greatneſs, and of the public ſafety. Gratian ſurvived thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable events only four or five years; but he ſurvived his reputation; and, before he fell a victim to rebellion, he had loſt, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the reſpect and confidence of the Roman world.</p>
            <p>The remarkable alteration of his character or <note place="margin">His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</note> conduct, may not be imputed to the arts of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which had beſieged the ſon of Valentinian from his infancy; nor to the headſtrong paſſions which that gentle youth appears to have eſcaped. A more attentive view of the life of Gratian, may perhaps ſuggeſt the true cauſe of the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the public hopes. His apparent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, inſtead of being the hardy productions of experience and adverſity, were the premature and artificial fruits of a royal education. The anxious tenderneſs of his father was continually employed to beſtow on him thoſe advantages, which he might perhaps eſteem the more highly, as he himſelf had been deprived of them; and the moſt ſkilful maſters of every ſcience, and of every art, had laboured to form the mind and body of the young prince <note n="1" place="bottom">Valentinian was leſs attentive to the religion of his ſon; ſince he entruſted the education of Gratian to Auſonius, a profeſſed Pagan (Mem. de l'Academie des Inſcriptions, tom. xv. p. 125—138.). The poetical fame of Auſonius condemns the taſte of his age.</note>. The knowledge which they pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0034700105:11"/>
communicated was diſplayed with oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and celebrated with laviſh praiſe. His ſoft and tractable diſpoſition received the fair impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their judicious precepts, and the abſence of paſſion might eaſily be miſtaken for the ſtrength of reaſon. His preceptors gradually roſe to the rank and conſequence of miniſters of ſtate <note n="2" place="bottom">Auſonius was ſucceſſively promoted to the Praetorian praefecture of Italy (A. D. 377.), and of Gaul (A. D. 378.); and was at length inveſted with the conſulſhip (A. D. 379.). He expreſſed his gratitude in a ſervile and inſipid piece of flattery (Actio Gratiarum, p. 699—736.), which has ſurvived more worthy productions.</note>; and, as they wiſely diſſembled their ſecret autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he ſeemed to act with firmneſs, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and with judgment, on the moſt important occaſions of his life and reign. But the influence of this elaborate inſtruction did not penetrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſurface; and the ſkilful preceptors, who ſo accurately guided the ſteps of their royal pupil, could not infuſe into his feeble and indolent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the vigorous and independent principle of action, which renders the laborious purſuit of glory eſſentially neceſſary to the happineſs, and almoſt to the exiſtence, of the hero. As ſoon as time and accident had removed thoſe faithful counſellors from the throne, the emperor of the Weſt inſenſibly deſcended to the level of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural genius; abandoned the reins of government to the ambitious hands which were ſtretched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to graſp them; and amuſed his leiſure with the moſt frivolous gratifications. A public ſale of favour and injuſtice was inſtituted, both
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0034700105:12"/>
in the court, and in the provinces, by the worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs delegates of his power, whoſe merit, it was made <hi>ſacrilege</hi> to queſtion <note n="3" place="bottom">Diſputare de principali judicio non oportet. Sacrilegii enim in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar eſt dubitare, an is dignus ſit, quem elegerit imperator. Codex Juſtinian. l. ix. tit. xxix. leg. 3. This convenient law was revived and promulgated, after the death of Gratian, by the feeble court of Milan.</note>. The conſcience of the credulous prince was directed by ſaints and biſhops <note n="4" place="bottom">Ambroſe compoſed, for his inſtruction, a theological treatiſe on the faith of the Trinity: and Tillemont (Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 158. 169.) aſcribes to the archbiſhop the merit of Gratian's intolerant laws.</note>; who procured an Imperial edict to puniſh, as a capital offence, the violation, the neglect, or even the ignorance, of the divine law <note n="5" place="bottom">Qui divinae legis ſanctitatem, neſciendo omittunt, aut negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo violant, et offendunt, ſacrilegium committunt. Codex Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian. l. ix. tit. xxix. leg. 1. Theodoſius indeed may claim his ſhare, in the merit of this comprehenſive law.</note>. Among the various arts which had exerciſed the youth of Gratian, he had applied himſelf, with ſingular inclination and ſucceſs, to manage the horſe, to draw the bow, and to dart the jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin; and theſe qualifications, which might be uſeful to a ſoldier, were proſtituted to the viler purpoſes of hunting. Large parks were incloſed for the Imperial pleaſures, and plentifully ſtocked with every ſpecies of wild beaſts; and Gratian neglected the duties, and even the dignity, of his rank, to conſume whole days in the vain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his dexterity and boldneſs in the chace. The pride and wiſh of the Roman emperor to excel in an art, in which he might be ſurpaſſed by the meaneſt of his ſlaves, reminded the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſpectators of the examples of Nero and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0034700105:13"/>
Commodus: but the chaſte and temperate Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian was a ſtranger to their monſtrous vices; and his hands were ſtained only with the blood of animals <note n="6" place="bottom">Ammianus (xxxi. 10.) and the younger Victor acknowledge the virtues of Gratian; and accuſe, or rather lament, his degenerate taſte. <q>The odious parallel of Commodus is ſaved by "licet incru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entus;" and perhaps Philoſtorgius (l. x. c. 10. and Godefroy, p. 412.) had guarded, with ſome ſimilar reſerve, the compariſon of Nero.</q>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The behaviour of Gratian, which degraded his <note place="margin">Diſcontent of the Roman troops. A. D. 383.</note> character in the eyes of mankind, could not have diſturbed the ſecurity of his reign, if the army had not been provoked to reſent their peculiar injuries. As long as the young emperor was guided by the inſtructions of his maſters, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf the friend and pupil of the ſoldiers; many of his hours were ſpent in the familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the camp; and the health, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, the rewards, the honours, of his faithful troops, appeared to be the object of his attentive concern. But, after Gratian more freely indulged his prevailing taſte for hunting and ſhooting, he naturally connected himſelf with the moſt dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous miniſters of his favourite amuſement. A body of the Alani was received into the military and domeſtic ſervice of the palace; and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſkill, which they were accuſtomed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play in the unbounded plains of Scythia, was exerciſed, on a more narrow theatre, in the parks and incloſures of Gaul.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0034700105:14"/>
and, as if he meant to inſult the public opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he frequently ſhewed himſelf to the ſoldiers and people, with the dreſs and arms, the long bow, the ſounding quiver, and the fur garments, of a Scythian warrior. The unworthy ſpectacle of a Roman prince, who had renounced the dreſs and manners of his country, filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation <note n="7" place="bottom">Zoſimus (l. iv. p. 247.) and the younger Victor aſcribe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution to the favour of the Alani, and the diſcontent of the Roman troops.

Even the Germans, ſo ſtrong and formidable in the armies of the empire, affected to diſdain the ſtrange and horrid appearance of the ſavages of the North, who, in the ſpace of a few years, had wandered from the banks of the Volga to thoſe of the Seine. A loud and licentious murmur was echoed through the camps and garriſons of the Weſt; and as the mild indolence of Gratian neglected to extinguiſh the firſt ſymptoms of diſcontent, the want of love and reſpect was not ſupplied by the influence of fear. But the ſubverſion of an eſtabliſhed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is always a work of ſome real, and of much apparent, difficulty; and the throne of Gratian was protected by the ſanctions of cuſtom, law, religion, and the nice balance of the civil and military powers, which had been eſtabliſhed by the policy of Conſtantine.

The troops, whoſe ſtation more immediately attached them to the ſervice of the palace, abandoned the ſtandard of Gratian the firſt time that it was diſplayed in the neighbourhood of Paris. The emperor of the Weſt fled towards Lyons, with a train of only three hundred horſe; and, in the cities along the road, where he hoped to find a refuge, or at leaſt a paſſage, he was taught, by cruel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that every gate is ſhut againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.

The events of this revolution had paſſed in ſuch rapid ſucceſſion, that it would have been impoſſible for Theodoſius to march to the relief <note place="margin">Treaty of peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Maximus and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius, A. D. 383—387.</note> of his benefactor, before he received the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his defeat and death. During the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſincere grief, or oſtentatious mourning, the Eaſtern emperor was interrupted by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival  of the principal chamberlain of Maximus: and the choice of a venerable old man, for an office which was uſually exerciſed by eunuchs, announced to the court of Conſtantinople the gravity and temperance of the Britiſh uſurper. The ambaſſador condeſcended to juſtify, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, the conduct of his maſter; and to proteſt, in ſpecious language, that the murder of Gratian had been perpetrated, without his knowledge or conſent, by the precipitate zeal of the ſoldiers. But he proceeded, in a firm and equal tone, to offer Theodoſius the alternative of peace, or war. The ſpeech of the ambaſſador concluded with a ſpirited declaration, that although Maximus, as a Roman, and as the father of his people, would chuſe rather to employ his forces in the common defence of the republic, he was armed and prepared, if his friendſhip ſhould be rejected, to diſpute, in a field of battle, the empire of the world. An immediate and peremptory anſwer was required; but it was extremely difficult for Theodoſius to ſatisfy, on this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occaſion, either the feelings of his own mind, or the expectations of the public. The imperious voice of honour and gratitude called aloud for revenge. From the liberality of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0034700105:20"/>
he had received the Imperial diadem: his patience would encourage the odious ſuſpicion, that he was more deeply ſenſible of former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, than of recent obligations; and if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the friendſhip, he muſt ſeem to ſhare the guilt, of the aſſaſſin. Even the principles of juſtice, and the intereſt of ſociety, would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus: and the example of ſucceſsful uſurpation would tend to diſſolve the artificial fabric of government, and once more to replunge the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age. But, as the ſentiments of gratitude and honour ſhould invariably regulate the conduct of an individual, they may be overbalanced in the mind of a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, by the ſenſe of ſuperior duties: and the maxims both of juſtice and humanity, muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the eſcape of an atrocious criminal, if an innocent people would be involved in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of his puniſhment. The aſſaſſin of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian had uſurped, but he actually poſſeſſed, the moſt warlike provinces of the empire: the Eaſt was exhauſted by the misfortunes, and even by the ſucceſs, of the Gothic war; and it was ſeriouſly to be apprehended, that, after the vital ſtrength of the republic had been waſted in a doubtful and deſtructive conteſt, the feeble conqueror would remain an eaſy prey to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians of the North. Theſe weighty conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions engaged Theodoſius to diſſemble his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to accept the alliance of the tyrant.

The brother of Gratian was confirmed and ſecured in the ſovereignty of Italy, Africa, and the Weſtern Illyricum; and ſome honourable conditions were inſerted in the treaty, to protect the memory, and the laws, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed emperor <note n="17" place="bottom">Ambroſe mentions the laws of Gratian, quas non abrogavit hoſtis (tom. ii. epiſt. xvii. p. 827.).</note>.

Among the benefactors
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0034700105:22"/>
of the church, the fame of Conſtantine has been rivalled by the glory of Theodoſius. If Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine had the advantage of erecting the ſtandard of the croſs, the emulation of his ſucceſſor aſſumed the merit of ſubduing the Arian hereſy, and of aboliſhing the worſhip of idols in the Roman world. Theodoſius was the firſt of the emperors baptiſed in the true faith of the Trinity. Although he was born of a Chriſtian family, the maxims, or at leaſt the practice, of the age, encouraged him to delay the ceremony of his initiation; till he was admoniſhed of the danger of delay, by the ſerious illneſs which threatened his life, towards the end of the firſt year of his reign. Before he again took the field againſt the Goths, he received the ſacrament of baptiſm <note n="20" place="bottom">For the baptiſm of Theodoſius, ſee Sozomen (l. vii. c. 4.), Socrates (l. v. c. 6.), and Tillemont (Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 728.).</note> from Acholius, the orthodox biſhop of Theſſalonica <note n="21" place="bottom">Aſcolius, or Acholius, was honoured by the friendſhip, and the praiſes, of Ambroſe; who ſtyles him, murus fidei atque ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis (tom. ii. epiſt. xv. p. 820.); and afterwards celebrates his ſpeed and diligence in running to Conſtantinople, Italy, &amp;c.

But the dangerous interview was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the prayers of the Empreſs Flaccilla, who trembled for the ſalvation of her huſband; and the mind of Theodoſius was confirmed by a theological argument, adapted to the rudeſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.

The next day after his arrival, he ſummoned Damophilus to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and offered that Arian prelate the hard alternative of ſubſcribing the Nicene creed, or of inſtantly reſigning, to the orthodox believers, the uſe and poſſeſſion of the epiſcopal palace, the cathedral of St. Sophia, and all the churches of Conſtantinople.

Theodoſius was ſtill inexorable: but as the angels who protected the Catholic cauſe, were only viſible to the eyes of faith, he prudently reinforced thoſe heavenly legions, with the more effectual aid of temporal and carnal weapons: and the church of St. Sophia was occupied by a large body of the Imperial guards. If the mind of Gregory was ſuſceptible of pride, he muſt have felt a very lively ſatisfaction, when the emperor conducted him through the ſtreets in ſolemn triumph; and, with his own hand, reſpectfully

placed him on the archiepiſcopal throne of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople. But the ſaint (who had not ſubdued the imperfections of human virtue) was deeply affected by the mortifying conſideration, that his entrance into the fold was that of a wolf, rather than of a ſhepherd: that the glittering arms, which ſurrounded his perſon, were neceſſary for his ſafety; and that he alone was the object of the imprecations of a great party, whom, as men and citizens, it was impoſſible for him to deſpiſe. He beheld the innumerable multitude of either ſex, and of every age, who crowded the ſtreets, the windows, and the roofs of the houſes; he heard the tumultuous voice of rage, grief, aſtoniſhment, and deſpair; and Gregory fairly confeſſes, that on the memorable day of his inſtallation, the capital of the Eaſt wore the appearance of a city taken by ſtorm, and in the hands of a Barbarian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror <note n="38" place="bottom">See Gregory Nazianzen, tom. ii. de Vitâ ſuâ, p. 21, 22.

Yet there is reaſon to imagine that the violence of zeal and revenge was, in ſome meaſure, eluded by the want of reſiſtance; and that, in their adverſity, the Arians diſplayed much leſs firmneſs, than had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of Conſtantius and Valens.

Both parties, in the ſchools, as well as in the temples, acknowledged and worſhipped the divine majeſty of Chriſt; and, as we are always prone to impute our own ſentiments and paſſions to the Deity, it would be deemed more prudent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful to exaggerate, than to circumſcribe, the adorable perfections of the Son of God. The diſciple of Athanaſius exulted in the proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that he had entitled himſelf to the divine

favour: while the follower of Arius muſt have been tormented, by the ſecret apprehenſion, that he was guilty, perhaps, of an unpardonable offence, by the ſcanty praiſe, and parſimonious honours, which he beſtowed on the Judge of the World. The opinions of Arianiſm might ſatisfy a cold and ſpeculative mind: but the doctrine of the Nicene Creed, moſt powerfully recommended by the merits of faith and devotion, was much better adapted to become popular and ſucceſsful in a believing age.</p>

A final and unanimous ſentence was pronounced to ratify the equal Deity of the Holy Ghoſt; the myſterious doctrine has been received by all the nations, and all the churches of the Chriſtian world; and their grateful reverence has aſſigned to the biſhops of Theodoſius, the ſecond rank among the general councils <note n="42" place="bottom">The firſt general council of Conſtantinople now triumphs in the Vatican: but the popes had long heſitated, and their heſitation perplexes, and almoſt ſtaggers, the humble Tillemont (Mem.

In an age, when the eccleſiaſtics had ſcandalouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from the model of apoſtolical purity, the moſt worthleſs and corrupt were always the moſt eager to frequent, and diſturb, the epiſcopal aſſemblies. The conflict and fermentation of ſo many oppoſite intereſts and tempers inflamed the paſſions of the biſhops: and their ruling paſſions were, the love of gold, and the love of diſpute. Many of the ſame prelates who now applauded the orthodox piety of Theodoſius, had repeatedly changed, with prudent flexibility, their creeds
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0034700105:36"/>
and opinions; and in the various revolutions of the church and ſtate, the religion of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign was the rule of their obſequious faith. When the emperor ſuſpended his prevailing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, the turbulent ſynod was blindly impelled, by the abſurd or ſelfiſh motives of pride, hatred, and reſentment. The death of Meletius, which happened at the council of Conſtantinople, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the moſt favourable opportunity of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating the ſchiſm of Antioch, by ſuffering his aged rival, Paulinus, peaceably to end his days in the epiſcopal chair. The faith and virtues of Paulinus were unblemiſhed. But his cauſe was ſupported by the Weſtern churches: and the biſhops of the ſynod reſolved to perpetuate the miſchiefs of diſcord, by the haſty ordination of a perjured candidate <note n="43" place="bottom">Before the death of Meletius, ſix or eight of his moſt popular eccleſiaſtics, among whom was Flavian, had <hi>abjured,</hi> for the ſake of peace, the biſhopric of Antioch (Sozomen, l. vii. c. 3. 11.

Their unanimous ſuffrage had confirmed the pretenſions which the biſhop of Conſtantinople derived from the choice of the people, and the approbation of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. But Gregory ſoon became the victim of malice and envy. The biſhops of the Eaſt, his ſtrenuous adherents, provoked by his moderation

in the affairs of Antioch, abandoned him, without ſupport, to the adverſe faction of the Egyptians; who diſputed the validity of his election, and rigorouſly aſſerted the obſolete canon, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the licentious practice of epiſcopal tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The pride, or the humility, of Gregory prompted him to decline a conteſt which might have been imputed to ambition and avarice; and he publicly offered, not without ſome mixture of indignation, to renounce the government of a church, which had been reſtored, and almoſt created, by his labours. His reſignation was accepted by the ſynod, and by the emperor, with more readineſs than he ſeems to have expected. At the time when he might have hoped to enjoy the fruits of his victory, his epiſcopal throne was filled by the ſenator Nectarius; and the new arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, accidentally recommended by his eaſy temper and venerable aſpect, was obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the ceremony of his conſecration, till he had previouſly diſpatched the rites of his baptiſm <note n="46" place="bottom">The whimſical ordination of Nectarius is atteſted by Sozomen (l. vii. c. 8.); but Tillemont obſerves (Mem.

After this remarkable experience of the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of princes and prelates, Gregory retired once more to his obſcure ſolitude of Cappadocia; where he employed the remainder of his life, about eight years, in the exerciſes of poetry and devotion.

The orthodox emperor conſidered every heretic as a rebel againſt the ſupreme powers of heaven, and of earth; and each of thoſe powers might exerciſe their peculiar juriſdiction over the ſoul and body of the guilty. The decrees of the council of Conſtantinople had aſcertained the true ſtandard of the faith; and the eccleſiaſtics, who governed the conſcience of Theodoſius, ſuggeſted the moſt effectual methods of perſecution. In the ſpace of fifteen years, he promulgated at leaſt fifteen ſevere edicts againſt the heretics <note n="48" place="bottom">See the Theodoſian Code, l. xvi. tit. v. leg. 6—23., with Godefroy's commentary on each law, and his general ſummary, or <hi>Paratition,</hi> tom. vi. p. 104—110.</note>; more eſpecially againſt thoſe who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity; and, to deprive them of every hope of eſcape, he ſternly enacted, that if any laws, or reſcripts, ſhould be alleged in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the judges ſhould conſider them as the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal productions either of fraud, or forgery. The penal ſtatutes were directed againſt the miniſters, the aſſembles, and the perſons, of the heretics; and the paſſions of the legiſlator were expreſſed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0034700105:40"/>
in the language of declamation and invective. I. The heretical teachers, who uſurped the ſacred titles of Biſhops, or Preſbyters, were not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the privileges and emoluments ſo liberally granted to the orthodox clergy, but they were expoſed to the heavy penalties of exile and confiſcation, if they preſumed to preach the doctrine, or to practiſe the rites, of their <hi>accurſed</hi> ſects. A fine of ten pounds of gold (above four hundred pounds Sterling) was impoſed on every perſon who ſhould dare to confer, or receive, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, an heretical ordination: and it was reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expected, that if the race of paſtors could be extinguiſhed, their helpleſs flocks would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, by ignorance and hunger, to return within the pale of the Catholic Church. II. The rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prohibition of conventicles was carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to every poſſible circumſtance, in which the heretics could aſſemble with the intention of worſhipping God and Chriſt according to the dictates of their conſcience. Their religious meetings, whether public or ſecret, by day or by night, in cities or in the country, were equally proſcribed by the edicts of Theodoſius; and the building, or ground, which had been uſed for that illegal purpoſe, was forfeited to the Imperial do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. III. It was ſuppoſed, that the error of the heretics could proceed only from the obſtinate temper of their minds; and that ſuch a temper was a fit object of cenſure and puniſhment. The anathemas of the church were fortified by a ſort of civil excommunication; which ſeparated them from their fellow-citizens, by a peculiar brand of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0034700105:41"/>
infamy; and this declaration of the ſupreme ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate tended to juſtify, or at leaſt to excuſe, the inſults of a fanatic populace. The ſectaries were gradually diſqualified for the poſſeſſion of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or lucrative, employments; and Theodoſius was ſatisfied with his own juſtice, when he decreed, that, as the Eunomians diſtinguiſhed the nature of the Son from that of the Father, they ſhould be incapable of making their wills, or of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any advantage from teſtamentary donations. The guilt of the Manichaean hereſy was eſteemed of ſuch magnitude, that it could be expiated only by the death of the offender; and the ſame capital puniſhment was inflicted on the Audians, or <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>todecimans</hi>

But an accurate, or rather a candid, enquiry, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that if the Priſcillianiſts violated the laws of nature, it was not by the licentiouſneſs, but by the auſterity, of their lives. They abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the uſe of the marriage-bed; and the peace of families was often diſturbed by indiſcreet ſeparations. They enjoined, or recommended, a total abſtinence from all animal food; and their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0034700105:44"/>
continual prayers, faſts, and vigils, inculcated a rule of ſtrict and perfect devotion. The ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative tenets of the ſect, concerning the perſon of Chriſt, and the nature of the human ſoul, were derived from the Gnoſtic and Manichaean ſyſtem; and this vain philoſophy, which had been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Egypt to Spain, was ill adapted to the groſſer ſpirits of the Weſt. The obſcure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Priſcillian ſuffered, languiſhed, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually diſappeared: his tenets were rejected by the clergy and people, but his death was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a long and vehement controverſy; while ſome arraigned, and others applauded, the juſtice of his ſentence. It is with pleaſure that we can obſerve, the humane inconſiſtency of the moſt illuſtrious ſaints and biſhops, Ambroſe of Milan <note n="57" place="bottom">Ambroſ. tom. ii. epiſt. xxiv. p. 891.</note>, and Martin of Tours <note n="58" place="bottom">In the Sacred Hiſtory, and the Life of St. Martin, Sulpicius Severus uſes ſome caution; but he declares himſelf more freely in the Dialogues (iii. 15.).

They pitied the unhappy men, who had been executed at Treves; they refuſed to hold communion with their epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal murderers; and if Martin deviated from that generous reſolution, his motives were laudable, and his repentance was exemplary.

The humanity of Ambroſe and Martin was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the ſcandalous irregularity of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt Priſcillian, and his adherents. The civil and eccleſiaſtical miniſters had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the limits of their reſpective provinces.

He was deſcended from a noble family of Romans; his father had exerciſed the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant office of Praetorian praefect of Gaul; and the ſon, after paſſing through the ſtudies of a liberal education, attained, in the regular grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of civil honours, the ſtation of conſular of Liguria, a province which included the Imperial reſidence of Milan. At the age of thirty-four, and before he had received the ſacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Ambroſe, to his own ſurpriſe, and to that of the world, was ſuddenly transformed from a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to an archbiſhop. Without the leaſt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it is ſaid, of art or intrigue, the whole body of the people unanimouſly ſaluted him with the epiſcopal title; the concord and perſeverance of their acclamations were aſcribed to a praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural impulſe; and the reluctant magiſtrate was compelled to undertake a ſpiritual office, for which he was not prepared by the habits and occupations of his former life. But the active force of his genius ſoon qualified him to exerciſe, with zeal
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0034700105:47"/>
and prudence, the duties of his eccleſiaſtical juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and, while he cheerfully renounced the vain and ſplendid trappings of temporal greatneſs, he condeſcended, for the good of the church, to direct the conſcience of the emperors, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the adminiſtration of the empire. Gratian loved and revered him as a father; and the ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate treatiſe on the ſaith of the Trinity, was deſigned for the inſtruction of the young prince. After his tragic death, at a time when the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Juſtina trembled for her own ſafety, and for that of her ſon Valentinian, the archbiſhop of Milan was diſpatched, on two different embaſſies, to the court of Treves. He exerciſed, with equal firmneſs and dexterity, the powers of his ſpiritual and political characters; and perhaps contributed, by his authority and eloquence, to check the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Maximus, and to protect the peace of Italy <note n="62" place="bottom">Ambroſe himſelf (tom. ii. epiſt. xxiv. p. 888—891.) gives the emperor a very ſpirited account of his own embaſſy.</note>. Ambroſe had devoted his life, and his abilities, to the ſervice of the church. Wealth was the object of his contempt; he had renounced his private patrimony; and he ſold, without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the conſecrated plate for the redemption of captives.

midſt of an orthodox people, had the misfortune of profeſſing the Arian hereſy, which ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to inſtil into the mind of her ſon. Juſtina was perſuaded, that a Roman emperor might claim, in his own dominions, the public exerciſe of his religion; and ſhe propoſed to the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, as a moderate and reaſonable conceſſion, that he ſhould reſign the uſe of a ſingle church, either in the city or ſuburbs of Milan.

               </note>. The palaces of the earth might indeed belong to Caeſar; but the churches were the houſes of God; and, within the limits of his dioceſe, he himſelf, as the lawful ſucceſſor of the apoſtles, was the only miniſter of God. The privileges of Chriſtianity, temporal as well as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, were confined to the true believers; and the mind of Ambroſe was ſatisfied, that his own theological opinions were the ſtandard of truth and orthodoxy. The archbiſhop, who refuſed to hold any conference, or negociation, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Satan, declared, with modeſt firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his reſolution to die a martyr, rather than to yield to the impious ſacrilege; and Juſtina, who reſented the refuſal as an act of inſolence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, haſtily determined to exert the Imperial prerogative of her ſon. As ſhe deſired to perform her public devotions on the approaching feſtival
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0034700105:49"/>
of Eaſter, Ambroſe was ordered to appear before the council. He obeyed the ſummons with the reſpect of a faithful ſubject, but he was followed, without his conſent, by an innumerable people: they preſſed, with impetuous zeal, againſt the gates of the palace; and the affrighted miniſters of Valentinian, inſtead of pronouncing a ſentence of exile on the archbiſhop of Milan, humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that he would interpoſe his authority, to protect the perſon of the emperor, and to reſtore the tranquillity of the capital. But the promiſes which Ambroſe received and communicated, were ſoon violated by a perfidious court; and, during ſix of the moſt ſolemn days, which Chriſtian piety has ſet apart for the exerciſe of religion, the city was agitated by the irregular convulſions of tumult and fanaticiſm. The officers of the houſehold were directed to prepare, firſt, the Portian, and afterwards, the new, <hi>Baſilica,</hi> for the immediate reception of the emperor, and his mother. The ſplendid canopy and hangings of the royal ſeat were arranged in the cuſtomary manner; but it was found neceſſary to defend them, by a ſtrong guard, from the inſults of the populace. The Arian eccleſiaſtics, who ventured to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſtreets, were expoſed to the moſt imminent danger of their lives: and Ambroſe enjoyed the merit and reputation of reſcuing his perſonal enemies from the hands of the enraged multitude.</p>
            <p>But while he laboured to reſtrain the effects of their zeal, the pathetic vehemence of his ſermons continually inflamed the angry and ſeditious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0034700105:50"/>
of the people of Milan. The characters of Eve, of the wife of Job, of Jezabel, of Herodias, were indecently applied to the mother of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; and her deſire to obtain a church for the Arians, was compared to the moſt cruel perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions which Chriſtianity had endured under the reign of Paganiſm. The meaſures of the court ſerved only to expoſe the magnitude of the evil. A fine of two hundred pounds of gold was impoſed on the corporate body of merchants and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers: an order was ſignified, in the name of the emperor, to all the officers, and inferior ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, of the courts of juſtice, that, during the continuance of the public diſorders, they ſhould ſtrictly confine themſelves to their houſes: and the miniſters of Valentinian imprudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the moſt reſpectable part of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Milan was attached to the cauſe of their archbiſhop. He was again ſolicited to reſtore peace to his country, by a timely compliance with the will of his ſovereign. The reply of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe was couched in the moſt humble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful terms, which might, however, be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as a ſerious declaration of civil war. <q>"His life and fortune were in the hands of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; but he would never betray the church of Chriſt, or degrade the dignity of the epiſcopal character.

They were encountered, on the ſacred threſhold, by the archbiſhop, who, thundering againſt them a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of excommunication, aſked them, in the tone of a father and a maſter, Whether it was to invade the houſe of God, that they had implored the hoſpitable protection of the republic? The ſuſpenſe of the Barbarians allowed ſome hours for a more effectual negociation; and the empreſs was perſuaded, by the advice of her wiſeſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, to leave the Catholics in poſſeſſion of all the churches of Milan; and to diſſemble, till a

By the influence of Juſtina, an edict of toleration was promulgated in all the provinces which were ſubject to the court of Milan; the free exerciſe of their religion was granted to thoſe who profeſſed the faith of Rimini; and the emperor declared, that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſhould infringe this ſacred and ſalutary conſtitution, ſhould be capitally puniſhed, as the enemies of the public peace <note n="65" place="bottom">Sozomen alone (l. vii. c. 13.) throws this luminous fact into a dark and perplexed narrative.</note>. The character and language of the archbiſhop of Milan may juſtify the ſuſpicion, that his conduct ſoon afforded a reaſonable ground, or at leaſt a ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to the Arian miniſters; who watched the opportunity of ſurpriſing him in ſome act of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to a law, which he ſtrangely repreſents as a law of blood and tyranny. A ſentence of eaſy and honourable baniſhment was pronounced, which enjoined Ambroſe to depart from Milan without delay; whilſt it permitted him to chuſe the place of his exile, and the number of his companions.

The numerous poor, who had been relieved by the liberality of Ambroſe, embraced the fair occaſion of ſignaliſing their zeal and gratitude; and as the patience of the multitude might have been exhauſted by the length and uniformity of nocturnal vigils, he prudently introduced into the church of Milan the uſeful inſtitution of a loud and regular pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ody.

The bones of the martyrs, their blood, their garments, were ſuppoſed to contain a healing power; and the praeternatural influence was communicated to the moſt diſtant objects, without loſing any part of its original virtue.

unable to contend with the favourite of heaven. The powers likewiſe of the earth interpoſed in the defence of Ambroſe: the diſintereſted advice of Theodoſius was the genuine reſult of piety and friendſhip; and the maſk of religious zeal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the hoſtile and ambitious deſigns of the tyrant of Gaul <note n="71" place="bottom">Tillemont, Mem.

But the aſpiring uſurper, whoſe ſordid ambition was not dignified by the love of glory and of arms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered his actual forces as the inſtruments only of his future greatneſs, and his ſucceſs was the immediate cauſe of his deſtruction. The wealth which he extorted <note n="72" place="bottom">The modeſt cenſure of Sulpicius (Dialog. iii. 15.) inflicts a much deeper wound than the feeble declamation of Pacatus (xii. 25, 26.).</note> from the oppreſſed provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was employed in levying and maintaining a formidable army of Barbarians, collected, for the moſt part, from the fierceſt nations of Germany. The conqueſt of Italy was the object of his hopes and preparations; and he ſecretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth, whoſe government was abhorred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by his Catholic ſubjects. But as Maximus wiſhed to occupy, without reſiſtance, the paſſes of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0034700105:56"/>
the Alps, he received, with perfidious ſmiles, Domninus of Syria, the ambaſſador of Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian, and preſſed him to accept the aid of a conſiderable body of troops, for the ſervice of a Pannonian war. The penetration of Ambroſe had diſcovered the ſnares of an enemy under the profeſſions of friendſhip <note n="73" place="bottom">Eſto tutior adverſus hominem, pacis involucro tegentem, was the wiſe caution of Ambroſe (tom. ii. p. 891.), after his return from his ſecond embaſſy.</note>; but the Syrian Dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus was corrupted, or deceived, by the liberal favour of the court of Treves; and the council of Milan obſtinately rejected the ſuſpicion of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with a blind confidence, which was the effect, not of courage, but of fear. The march of the auxiliaries was guided by the ambaſſador; and they were admitted, without diſtruſt, into the fortreſſes of the Alps. But the crafty tyrant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, with haſty and ſilent footſteps, in the rear; and, as he diligently intercepted all intelligence of his motions, the gleam of armour, and the duſt excited by the troops of cavalry, firſt announced the hoſtile approach of a ſtranger to the gates of Milan. In this extremity, Juſtina and her ſon might accuſe their own imprudence, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious arts of Maximus; but they wanted time, and force, and reſolution, to ſtand againſt the Gauls and Germans, either in the field, or within the walls of a large and diſaffected city. Flight was their only hope, Aquileia their only refuge; and as Maximus now diſplayed his genuine cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the brother of Gratian might expect the ſame fate from the hands of the ſame aſſaſſin.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0034700105:57"/>
Maximus entered Milan in triumph; and if the wiſe archbiſhop refuſed a dangerous and criminal connection with the uſurper, he might indirectly contribute to the ſucceſs of his arms, by incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, from the pulpit, the duty of reſignation, rather than that of reſiſtance <note n="74" place="bottom">Baronius (A. D. 387. No 63.) applies to this ſeaſon of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic diſtreſs ſome of the penitential ſermons of the archbiſhop.</note>. The unfortunate Juſtina reached Aquileia in ſafety; but ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the ſtrength of the fortifications; ſhe dreaded the event of a ſiege; and ſhe reſolved to implore the protection of the great Theodoſius, whoſe power and virtue were celebrated in all the countries of the Weſt. A veſſel was ſecretly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to tranſport the Imperial family; they embarked with precipitation in one of the obſcure harbours of Venetia, or Iſtria; traverſed the whole extent of the Hadriatic and Ionian ſeas; turned the extreme promontory of Peloponneſus; and, after a long, but ſucceſsful, navigation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves in the port of Theſſalonica. All the ſubjects of Valentinian deſerted the cauſe of a prince, who, by his abdication, had abſolved <note place="margin">Flight of Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian.</note> them from the duty of allegiance; and if the little city of Aemona, on the verge of Italy, had not preſumed to ſtop the career of his inglorious victory, Maximus would have obtained, without a ſtruggle, the ſole poſſeſſion of the weſtern em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of inviting his royal gueſts to the palace <note place="margin">Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius takes arms in the cauſe of Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian. A.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0034700105:58"/>
theſe reaſons did not proceed from contempt or indifference, as he ſpeedily made a viſit to that city, accompanied by the greateſt part of his court and ſenate. After the firſt tender expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of friendſhip and ſympathy, the pious emperor of the Eaſt gently admoniſhed Juſtina, that the guilt of hereſy was ſometimes puniſhed in this world, as well as in the next; and that the public profeſſion of the Nicene faith, would be the moſt efficacious ſtep to promote the reſtoration of her ſon, by the ſatisfaction which it muſt occaſion both on earth and in heaven. The momentous queſtion of peace or war was referred, by Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius, to the deliberation of his council; and the arguments which might be alleged on the ſide of honour and juſtice, had acquired, ſince the death of Gratian, a conſiderable degree of addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional weight. The perſecution of the Imperial family, to which Theodoſius himſelf had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for his fortune, was now aggravated by recent and repeated injuries. Neither oaths nor treaties could reſtrain the boundleſs ambition of Maximus; and the delay of vigorous and deciſive meaſures, inſtead of prolonging the bleſſings of peace, would expoſe the eaſtern empire to the danger of an hoſtile invaſion. The Barbarians, who had paſſed the Danube, had lately aſſumed the character of ſoldiers and ſubjects, but their native fierceneſs was yet untamed; and the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of a war, which would exerciſe their valour, and diminiſh their numbers, might tend to relieve the provinces from an intolerable oppreſſion. Notwithſtanding theſe ſpecious and ſolid reaſons,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0034700105:59"/>
which were approved by a majority of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, Theodoſius ſtill heſitated, whether he ſhould draw the ſword in a conteſt, which could no longer admit any terms of reconciliation; and his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous character was not diſgraced by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions which he felt for the ſafety of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſons, and the welfare of his exhauſted people. In this moment of anxious doubt, while the fate of the Roman world depended on the reſolution of a ſingle man, the charms of the princeſs Galla moſt powerfully pleaded the cauſe of her brother Valentinian <note n="75" place="bottom">The flight of Valentinian, and the love of Theodoſius for his ſiſter, are related by Zoſimus (l. iv. p. 263, 264.). Tillemont pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſome weak and ambiguous evidence to antedate the ſecond marriage of Theodoſius (Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 740.), and conſequently to refute ces contes de Zoſime, qui ſeroient trop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traires à la pieté de Theodoſe.</note>. The heart of Theodoſius was ſoftened by the tears of beauty; his affections were inſenſibly engaged by the graces of youth and innocence; the art of Juſtina managed and directed the impulſe of paſſion; and the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the royal nuptials was the aſſurance and ſignal of the civil war. The unfeeling critics, who conſider every amorous weakneſs as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible ſtain on the memory of a great and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox emperor, are inclined, on this occaſion, to diſpute the ſuſpicious evidence of the hiſtorian Zoſimus. For my own part, I ſhall frankly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that I am willing to find, or even to ſeek, in the revolutions of the world, ſome traces of the mild and tender ſentiments of domeſtic life; and, amidſt the crowd of fierce and ambitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, I can diſtinguiſh, with peculiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,

a gentle hero, who may be ſuppoſed to receive his armour from the hands of love. The alliance of the Perſian king was ſecured by the faith of treaties; the martial Barbarians were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to follow the ſtandard, or to reſpect the frontiers, of an active and liberal monarch; and the dominions of Theodoſius, from the Euphrates to the Hadriatic, reſounded with the preparations of war both by land and ſea. The ſkilful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the forces of the Eaſt ſeemed to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply their numbers, and diſtracted the attention of Maximus. He had reaſon to fear, that a choſen body of troops, under the command of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid Arbogaſtes, would direct their march along the banks of the Danube, and boldly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate through the Rhaetian provinces into the centre of Gaul. A powerful fleet was equipped in the harbours of Greece and Epirus, with an apparent deſign, that as ſoon as the paſſage had been opened by a naval victory, Valentinian, and his mother, ſhould land in Italy, proceed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, to Rome, and occupy the majeſtic ſeat of religion and empire. In the mean while, Theodoſius himſelf advanced at the head of a brave and diſciplined army, to encounter his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy rival, who, after the ſiege of Aemona, had fixed his camp in the neighbourhood of Siſcia, a city of Pannonia, ſtrongly fortified by the broad and rapid ſtream of the Save.</p>

with his ſucceſſor, who, like him, had uſurped the throne of the Weſt, was eaſily decided in the term of two months <note n="76" place="bottom">See Godefroy's Chronology of the Laws, Cod. Theodoſ. tom. i. p. cxix.</note>, and within the ſpace of two hundred miles. The ſuperior genius of the emperor of the Eaſt might prevail over the feeble Maximus; who, in this important criſis, ſhewed himſelf deſtitute of military ſkill, or perſonal cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; but the abilities of Theodoſius were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the advantage which he poſſeſſed of a numerous and active cavalry. The Huns, the Alani, and, after their example, the Goths them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were formed into ſquadrons of archers; who fought on horſeback, and confounded the ſteady valour of the Gauls and Germans, by the rapid motions of a Tartar war. After the fatigue of a long march, in the heat of ſummer, they ſpurred their foaming horſes into the waters of the Save, ſwam the river in the preſence of the enemy, and inſtantly charged and routed the troops who guarded the high ground on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide. Marcellinus, the tyrant's brother, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to ſupport them with the ſelect cohorts, which were conſidered as the hope and ſtrength of the army. The action, which had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the approach of night, was renewed in the morning; and, after a ſharp conflict, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving remnant of the braveſt ſoldiers of Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus threw down their arms at the feet of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. Without ſuſpending his march, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the loyal acclamations of the citizens of Aemona, Theodoſius preſſed forwards, to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0034700105:62"/>
the war by the death or captivity of his rival, who fled before him with the diligence of fear. From the ſummit of the Julian Alps, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended with ſuch incredible ſpeed into the plain of Italy, that he reached Aquileia on the evening of the firſt day; and Maximus, who found himſelf encompaſſed on all ſides, had ſcarcely time to ſhut the gates of the city. But the gates could not long reſiſt the effort of a victorious enemy; and the deſpair, the diſaffection, the indifference of the ſoldiers and people, haſtened the downfall of the wretched Maximus. He was dragged from his throne, rudely ſtripped of the Imperial orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the robe, the diadem, and the purple ſlippers; and conducted, like a malefactor, to the camp and preſence of Theodoſius, at a place about three miles from Aquileia. The behaviour of the emperor was not intended to inſult, and he ſhewed ſome diſpoſition to pity and forgive, the tyrant of the Weſt, who had never been his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal enemy, and was now become the object of his contempt. Our ſympathy is the moſt forcibly excited by the misfortunes to which we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; and the ſpectacle of a proud competitor, now proſtrate at his feet, could not fail of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing very ſerious and ſolemn thoughts in the mind of the victorious emperor. But the feeble emotion of involuntary pity was checked by his regard for public juſtice, and the memory of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the ſoldiers, who drew him out of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial preſence, and inſtantly ſeparated his head from his body. The intelligence of his defeat
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0034700105:63"/>
and death was received with ſincere, or well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſembled, joy: his ſon Victor, on whom he had conferred the title of Auguſtus, died by the order, perhaps by the hand, of the bold Arbogaſtes; and all the military plans of Theodoſius were ſucceſsfully executed. When he had thus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the civil war, with leſs difficulty and bloodſhed than he might naturally expect, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the winter months of his reſidence at Milan, to reſtore the ſtate of the afflicted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; and early in the ſpring he made, after the example of Conſtantine and Conſtantius, his triumphal entry into the ancient capital of the Roman empire <note n="77" place="bottom">Beſides the hints which may be gathered from chronicles and eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, Zoſimus (l. iv. p. 259—267.), Oroſius (l. vii. c. 35.), and Pacatus (in Panegyr.

The
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0034700105:64"/>
wiſdom of his laws, and the ſucceſs of his arms, rendered his adminiſtration reſpectable in the eyes both of his ſubjects, and of his enemies. He loved and practiſed the virtues of domeſtic life, which ſeldom hold their reſidence in the palaces of kings. Theodoſius was chaſte and temperate: he enjoyed, without exceſs, the ſenſual and ſocial pleaſures of the table; and the warmth of his amorous paſſions was never diverted from their lawful objects. The proud titles of Imperial greatneſs were adorned by the tender names of a faithful huſband, an indulgent father; his uncle was raiſed, by his affectionate eſteem, to the rank of a ſecond parent: Theodoſius embraced, as his own, the children of his brother and ſiſter; and the expreſſions of his regard were extended to the moſt diſtant and obſcure branches of his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous kindred. His familiar friends were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly ſelected from among thoſe perſons, who, in the equal intercourſe of private life, had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before his eyes without a maſk: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of perſonal and ſuperior merit enabled him to deſpiſe the accidental diſtinction of the purple; and he proved by his conduct, that he had forgotten all the injuries, while he moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully remembered all the favours and ſervices, which he had received before he aſcended the throne of the Roman empire. The ſerious, or lively, tone of his converſation, was adapted to the age, the rank, or the character, of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whom he admitted into his ſociety; and the affability of his manners diſplayed the image of his mind. Theodoſius reſpected the ſimplicity of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0034700105:65"/>
the good and virtuous; every art, every talent, of an uſeful, or even of an innocent, nature, was rewarded by his judicious liberality; and, except the heretics, whom he perſecuted with implacable hatred, the diffuſive circle of his benevolence was circumſcribed only by the limits of the human race. The government of a mighty empire may aſſuredly ſuffice to occupy the time, and the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, of a mortal: yet the diligent prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſpiring to the unſuitable reputation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found learning, always reſerved ſome moments of his leiſure for the inſtructive amuſement of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hiſtory, which enlarged his experience, was his favourite ſtudy. The annals of Rome, in the long period of eleven hundred years, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with a various and ſplendid picture of human life; and it has been particularly obſerved, that whenever he peruſed the cruel acts of Cinna, of Marius, or of Sylla, he warmly expreſſed his generous deteſtation of thoſe enemies of humanity and freedom. His diſintereſted opinion of paſt events was uſefully applied as the rule of his own actions; and Theodoſius has deſerved the ſingular commendation, that his virtues always ſeemed to expand with his fortune: the ſeaſon of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity was that of his moderation; and his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency appeared the moſt conſpicuous after the danger and ſucceſs of the civil war. The Mooriſh guards of the tyrant had been maſſacred in the firſt heat of the victory; and a ſmall number of the moſt obnoxious criminals ſuffered the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the law. But the emperor ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much more attentive to relieve the innocent,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0034700105:66"/>
than to chaſtiſe the guilty. The oppreſſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Weſt, who would have deemed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy in the reſtoration of their lands, were aſtoniſhed to receive a ſum of money equivalent to their loſſes; and the liberality of the conqueror ſupported the aged mother, and educated the orphan daughters, of Maximus <note n="80" place="bottom">Ambroſ. tom. ii. epiſt. xl. p. 955. Pacatus, from the want of ſkill, or of courage, omits this glorious circumſtance.</note>. A character thus accompliſhed, might almoſt excuſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant ſuppoſition of the orator Pacatus; that, if the elder Brutus could be permitted to reviſit the earth, the ſtern republican would abjure, at the feet of Theodoſius, his hatred of kings; and ingenuouſly confeſs, that ſuch a monarch was the moſt faithful guardian of the happineſs and dignity, of the Roman people <note n="81" place="bottom">Pacat. in Panegyr.

Theodoſius (Claud. in iv. Conſ. Hon. 266, &amp;c.) exhorts his ſon to moderate his anger.</note>. In the purſuit of an important object, his active courage
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0034700105:67"/>
was capable of the moſt vigorous exertions; but, as ſoon as the deſign was accompliſhed, or the danger was ſurmounted, the hero ſunk into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious repoſe; and, forgetful that the time of a prince is the property of his people, reſigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the enjoyment of the innocent, but trifling, pleaſures of a luxurious court. The natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Theodoſius was haſty and choleric; and, in a ſtation where none could reſiſt, and few would diſſuade, the fatal conſequence of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, the humane monarch was juſtly alarmed by the conſciouſneſs of his infirmity, and of his power. It was the conſtant ſtudy of his life to ſuppreſs, or regulate, the intemperate ſallies of paſſion; and the ſucceſs of his efforts enhanced the merit of his clemency. But the painful vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which claims the merit of victory, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the danger of deſeat; and the reign of a wiſe and merciful prince was polluted by an act of cruelty, which would ſtain the annals of Nero or Domitian.

The exigencies of the Gothic war, and the inevitable expence that accompanied the concluſion of the peace, had conſtrained the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to aggravate the weight of the public im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; and the provinces of Aſia, as they had not been involved in the diſtreſs, were the leſs inclined to contribute to the relief, of Europe. The auſpicious period now approached of the tenth year of his reign; a feſtival more grateful to the ſoldiers, who received a liberal donative, than to the ſubjects, whoſe voluntary offerings had been long ſince converted into an extraordinary and oppreſſive burthen. The edicts of taxation interrupted the repoſe, and pleaſures, of Antioch; and the tribunal of the magiſtrate was beſieged by a ſuppliant crowd; who, in pathetic, but, at firſt, in reſpectful, language, ſolicited the redreſs of their grievances. They were gradually incenſed by the pride of their haughty rulers, who treated their complaints as a criminal reſiſtance; their ſatirical wit degenerated into ſharp and angry invectives; and, from the ſubordinate powers of government, the invectives of the people inſenſibly roſe to attack the ſacred character of the emperor himſelf. Their fury, provoked by a feeble oppoſition, diſcharged itſelf on the <note place="margin">Feb. 26.</note> images of the Imperial family, which were erected, as objects of public veneration, in the moſt conſpicuous places of the city. The ſtatues of Theodoſius, of his father, of his wife Flaccilla, of his two ſons, Arcadius and Honorius, were
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0034700105:69"/>
inſolently thrown down from their pedeſtals, broken in pieces, or dragged with contempt through the ſtreets: and the indignities which were offered to the repreſentations of Imperial majeſty, ſufficiently declared the impious and treaſonable wiſhes of the populace. The tumult was almoſt immediately ſuppreſſed by the arrival of a body of archers; and Antioch had leiſure to reflect on the nature and conſequences of her crime <note n="84" place="bottom">The Chriſtians and Pagans agreed in believing; that the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Antioch was excited by the daemons.

The nobleſt, and moſt wealthy, of the citizens of Antioch, appeared before them in chains; the examination was aſſiſted by the uſe of torture, and their ſentence was pronounced or ſuſpended, according to the judgment of theſe extraordinary magiſtrates.

Theodoſius had already ſubſided; the deputies of the people, both the biſhop and the orator, had obtained a favourable audience; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the emperor were the complaints of injured friendſhip, rather than the ſtern menaces of pride and power.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0034700105:73"/>
more dreadful conſequences. That great city, the metropolis of all the Illyrian provinces, had been protected from the dangers of the Gothic war by ſtrong fortifications, and a numerous gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. Botheric, the general of thoſe troops, and, as it ſhould ſeem from his name, a Barbarian, had among his ſlaves a beautiful boy, who excited the impure deſires of one of the charioteers of the Circus. The inſolent and brutal lover was thrown into priſon by the order of Botheric; and he ſternly rejected the importunate clamours of the multitude, who, on the day of the public games, lamented the abſence of their favourite; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the ſkill of a charioteer as an object of more importance than his virtue. The reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people was embittered by ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious diſputes; and, as the ſtrength of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon had been drawn away for the ſervice of the Italian war, the feeble remnant, whoſe numbers were reduced by deſertion, could not ſave the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy general from their licentious fury. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theric, and ſeveral of his principal officers, were inhumanly murdered: their mangled bodies were dragged about the ſtreets; and the emperor, who then reſided at Milan, was ſurpriſed by the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty of the people of Theſſalonica. The ſentence of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate judge would have inflicted a ſevere puniſhment on the authors of the crime; and the merit of Botheric might contribute to exaſperate the grief and indignation of his maſter. The fiery and choleric temper of Theodoſius was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the dilatory forms of a judicial enquiry;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0034700105:74"/>
and he haſtily reſolved, that the blood of his lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant ſhould be expiated by the blood of the guilty people. Yet his mind ſtill fluctuated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the counſels of clemency and of revenge; the zeal of the biſhops had almoſt extorted from the reluctant emperor the promiſe of a general pardon; his paſſion was again inflamed by the flattering ſuggeſtions of his miniſter Rufinus; and, after Theodoſius had diſpatched the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of death, he attempted, when it was too late, to prevent the execution of his orders. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of a Roman city was blindly committed to the undiſtinguiſhing ſword of the Barbarians; and the hoſtile preparations were concerted with the dark and perfidious artifice of an illegal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy. The people of Theſſalonica were trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly invited, in the name of their ſovereign, to the games of the Circus: and ſuch was their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiate avidity for thoſe amuſements, that every conſideration of fear, or ſuſpicion, was diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded by the numerous ſpectators. As ſoon as the aſſembly was complete, the ſoldiers, who had ſecretly been poſted round the circus, received the ſignal, not of the races, but of a general maſſacre. The promiſcuous carnage continued three hours, without diſcrimination of ſtrangers or natives, of age or ſex, of innocence or guilt; the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate accounts ſtate the number of the ſlain at ſeven thouſand; and it is affirmed by ſome writers, that more than fifteen thouſand victims were ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to the manes of Botheric. A foreign mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who had probably no concern in his murder, offered his own life, and all his wealth, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

the place of <hi>one</hi> of his two ſons; but, while the father heſitated with equal tenderneſs, while he was doubtful to chuſe, and unwilling to condemn, the ſoldiers determined his ſuſpenſe, by plunging their daggers at the ſame moment into the breaſts of the defenceleſs youths. The apology of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins, that they were obliged to produce the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed number of heads, ſerves only to increaſe, by an appearance of order and deſign, the horrors of the maſſacre, which was executed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Theodoſius. The guilt of the emperor is aggravated by his long and frequent reſidence at Theſſalonica. The ſituation of the unfortunate city, the aſpect of the ſtreets and buildings, the dreſs and faces of the inhabitants, were familiar, and even preſent, to his imagination; and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius poſſeſſed a quick and lively ſenſe of the exiſtence of the people whom he deſtroyed <note n="91" place="bottom">The original evidence of Ambroſe (tom. ii. epiſt. li. p. 998.), Auguſtin (de Civitat.

The monks and populace of Callinicum, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure town on the frontier of Perſia, excited by their own fanaticiſm, and by that of their biſhop, had tumultuouſly burnt a conventicle of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians, and a ſynagogue of the Jews. The ſeditious prelate was condemned, by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of the province, either to rebuild the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, or to repay the damage; and this mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſentence was confirmed by the emperor. But it was not confirmed by the archbiſhop of Milan <note n="92" place="bottom">See the whole tranſaction in Ambroſe (tom. ii. epiſt. xl, xli. p. 946—956.), and his biographer Paulinus (c. 23.).

The emperor was deeply affected by his own reproaches, and by thoſe of his ſpiritual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, after he had bewailed the miſchievous and irreparable conſequences of his raſh fury, he proceeded, in the accuſtomed manner, to perform his devotions in the great church of Milan. He was ſtopped in the porch by the archbiſhop; who, in the tone and language of an ambaſſador of Heaven, declared to his ſovereign, that private contrition was not ſufficient to atone for a public fault, or to appeaſe the juſtice of the offended Deity. Theodoſius humbly repreſented, that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide, David, the man after God's own heart, had been guilty, not only of murder, but of adultery. <q>"You have imitated David in his crime, imitate then his repentance,"</q> was the reply of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Ambroſe. The rigorous conditions of peace and pardon were accepted; and the public pennance of the emperor Theodoſius has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as one of the moſt honourable events in the annals of the church.

authority of the laws; and to correct the abuſes, which had prevailed with impunity under the uſurpation of Maximus, and the minority of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian.

The important commands of the army were diſtributed among the Franks; the creatures of Arbogaſtes were promoted to all the honours and offices of the civil government; the progreſs of the conſpiracy removed every faithful ſervant from the preſence of Valentinian; and the emperor, without power, and without intelligence, inſenſibly ſunk into the precarious and dependent condition of a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <note n="105" place="bottom">Gregory of Tours (l. ii. c. 9. p. 165. in the ſecond volume of the Hiſtorians of France) has preſerved a curious fragment of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picius Alexander, an hiſtorian far more valuable than himſelf.</note>.

But the hopes of relief were diſtant, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and, as every day furniſhed ſome new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, the emperor, without ſtrength or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, too haſtily reſolved to riſk an immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with his powerful general.

The army of Theodoſius was ſheltered by their poſition from the impetuoſity of the wind, which blew a cloud of duſt in the faces of the enemy, diſordered their ranks, wreſted their weapons from their hands, and diverted, or repelled, their ineffectual javelins.

The opinion, and perhaps the intereſt, of the public had confirmed the diviſion of the Eaſtern and Weſtern empires; and the two royal youths, Arcadius and Honorius, who had already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, from the tenderneſs of their father, the title of Auguſtus, were deſtined to fill the thrones of Conſtantinople and of Rome.

The arrival of Honorius at Milan was welcomed by a ſplendid exhibition of the games of the Circus;

and the emperor, through he was oppreſſed by the weight of his diſorder, contributed by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to the public joy. But the remains of his ſtrength were exhauſted by the painful effort, which he made, to aſſiſt at the ſpectacles of the morning. Honorius ſupplied, during the reſt of the day, the place of his father; and the great Theodoſius expired in the enſuing night. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the recent animoſities of a civil war, his death was univerſally lamented. The Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, whom he had vanquiſhed, and the churchmen, by whom he had been ſubdued, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, with loud and ſincere applauſe, the qualities of the deceaſed emperor, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the moſt valuable in their eyes.

ſpirit, which ſacrifices, without a bluſh the conſideration of duty and intereſt to the baſe indulgence of ſloth and appetite <note n="124" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. iv. p. 244.</note>. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of contemporary writers, who deplore the increaſe of luxury, and depravation of manners, are commonly expreſſive of their peculiar temper and ſituation. There are few obſervers, who poſſeſs a clear and comprehenſive view of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of ſociety; and who are capable of diſcovering the nice and ſecret ſprings of action, which impel, in the ſame uniform direction, the blind and capricious paſſions of a multitude of individuals. If it can be affirmed, with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of truth, that the luxury of the Romans was more ſhameleſs and diſſolute in the reign of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius than in the age of Conſtantine, perhaps, or of Auguſtus, the alteration cannot be aſcribed to any beneficial improvements, which had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually increaſed the ſtock of national riches. A long period of calamity or decay muſt have checked the induſtry, and diminiſhed the wealth, of the people; and their profuſe luxury muſt have been the reſult of that indolent deſpair, which enjoys the preſent hour, and declines the thoughts of futurity. The uncertain condition of their property diſcouraged the ſubjects of Theodoſius from engaging in thoſe uſeful and laborious undertakings which require an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate expence, and promiſe a ſlow and diſtant advantage. The frequent examples of ruin and deſolation tempted them not to ſpare the remains
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0034700105:97"/>
of a patrimony, which might, every hour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the prey of the rapacious Goth. And the mad prodigality which prevails in the confuſion of a ſhipwreck, or a ſiege, may ſerve to explain the progreſs of luxury amidſt the misfortunes and terrors of a ſinking nation.</p>
            <p>The effeminate luxury, which infected the <note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry lay aſide their armour.</note> manners of courts and cities, had inſtilled a ſecret and deſtructive poiſon into the camps of the legions: and their degeneracy has been marked by the pen of a military writer, who had accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudied the genuine and ancient principles of Roman diſcipline. It is the juſt and important obſervation of Vegetius, that the infantry was invariably covered with defenſive armour, from the foundation of the city, to the reign of the emperor Gratian. The relaxation of diſcipline, and the diſuſe of exerciſe, rendered the ſoldiers leſs able, and leſs willing, to ſupport the fatigues of the ſervice; they complained of the weight of the armour, which they ſeldom wore; and they ſucceſſively obtained the permiſſion of laying aſide both their cuiraſſes and their helmets. The heavy weapons of their anceſtors, the ſhort ſword, and the formidable <hi>pilum,</hi> which had ſubdued the world, inſenſibly dropped from their feeble hands. As the uſe of the ſhield is incompatible with that of the bow, they reluctantly marched into the field; condemned to ſuffer, either the pain of wounds, or the ignominy of flight, and always diſpoſed to prefer the more ſhameful alternative. The cavalry of the Goths, the Huns, and the Alani, had felt the benefits, and adopted the uſe,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0034700105:98"/>
of defenſive armour; and, as they excelled in the management of miſſile weapons, they eaſily overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions, whoſe heads and breaſts were expoſed, without defence, to the arrows of the Barbarians. The loſs of armies, the deſtruction of cities, and the diſhonour of the Roman name, ineffectually ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the ſucceſſors of Gratian to reſtore the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets and cuiraſſes of the infantry. The enervated ſoldiers abandoned their own, and the public, defence; and their puſillanimous indolence may be conſidered as the immediate cauſe of the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal of the empire <note n="125" place="bottom">Vegetius, de Re Militari, l. i. c. 10.

            </head>
            <p>THE ruin of Paganiſm, in the age of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius, is perhaps the only example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition <note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Pagan religion. A. D. 378—395.</note>; and may therefore deſerve to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as a ſingular event in the hiſtory of the human mind. The Chriſtians, more eſpecially the clergy, had impatiently ſupported the prudent delays of Conſtantine, and the equal toleration of the elder Valentinian; nor could they deem their conqueſt perfect or ſecure, as long as their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries were permitted to exiſt. The influence, which Ambroſe and his brethren had acquired over the youth of Gratian, and the piety of Theodoſius, was employed to infuſe the maxims of perſecution into the breaſts of their Imperial proſelytes. Two ſpecious principles of religious juriſprudence were eſtabliſhed, from whence they deduced a direct and rigorous concluſion, againſt the ſubjects of the empire, who ſtill adhered to the ceremonies of their anceſtors: <hi>that,</hi> the magiſtrate is, in ſome meaſure, guilty of the crimes which he neglects to prohibit, or to puniſh; and, <hi>that</hi> the idolatrous worſhip of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous deities, and real daemons, is the moſt abominable crime againſt the ſupreme majeſty of the Creator. The laws of Moſes, and the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0034700105:100"/>
examples of Jewiſh hiſtory <note n="1" place="bottom">St. Ambroſe (tom. ii. de Obit. Theodoſ. p. 1208.) expreſsly praiſes and recommends the zeal of Joſiah in the deſtruction of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The language of Julius Firmicus Maternus on the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (de Errore Profan. Relig. p. 467, edit. Gronov.) is piouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human. Nec filio jubet (the Moſaic Law) parci, nec fratri, et per amatam conjugem gladium vindicem ducit, &amp;c.</note>, were haſtily, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps erroneouſly, applied, by the clergy, to the mild and univerſal reign of Chriſtianity <note n="2" place="bottom">Bayle (tom. ii. p. 406, in his Commentaire Philoſophique) juſtifies, and limits, theſe intolerant laws by the temporal reign of Jehovah over the Jews. The attempt is laudable.</note>. The zeal of the emperors was excited to vindicate their own honour, and that of the Deity: and the temples of the Roman world were ſubverted, about ſixty years after the converſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</p>
            <p>From the age of Numa, to the reign of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, <note place="margin">State of Paganiſm at Rome.</note> the Romans preſerved the regular ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſeveral colleges of the ſacerdotal order <note n="3" place="bottom">See the outlines of the Roman hierarchy in Cicero (de Legibus, ii. 7, 8.), Livy (i. 20.), Dionyſius Harlicarnaſſenſis (l. ii. p. 119—129. edit. Hudſon), Beaufort (Republique Romaine, tom. i. p. 1—90.), and Moyle (vol. i. p. 10—55.). The laſt is the work of an Engliſh Whig, as well as of a Roman antiquary.</note>. Fifteen PONTIFFS exerciſed their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme juriſdiction over all things, and perſons, that were conſecrated to the ſervice of the gods; and the various queſtions which perpetually aroſe in a looſe and traditionary ſyſtem, were ſubmitted to the judgment of their holy tribunal. Fifteen grave and learned AUGURS obſerved the face of the heavens, and preſcribed the actions of heroes, according to the flight of birds. Fifteen keepers of the Sybilline books (their name of QUIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DECEMVIRS

was derived from their number) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally conſulted the hiſtory of future, and, as it ſhould ſeem, of contingent, events. Six VESTALS devoted their virginity to the guard of the ſacred fire, and of the unknown pledges of the duration of Rome; which no mortal had been ſuffered to behold with impunity <note n="4" place="bottom">Theſe myſtic, and perhaps imaginary, ſymbols have given birth to various fables and conjectures. It ſeems probable, that the Palladium was a ſmall ſtatute (three cubits and a half high) of Minerva, with a lance and diſtaff; that it was uſually incloſed in a <hi>ſeria,</hi> or barrel; and that a ſimilar barrel was placed by its ſide, to diſconcert curioſity, or ſacrilege. See Mezeriac (Comment. ſur les Epitres d'Ovide, tom. i. p. 60—66.), and Lipſius (tom. iii. p. 610. de Veſtâ, &amp;c. c. 10.).</note>. Seven EPULOS prepared the table of the gods, conducted the ſolemn proceſſion, and regulated the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the annual feſtival. The three FLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENS of Jupiter, of Mars, and of Quirinus, were conſidered as the peculiar miniſters of the three moſt powerful deities, who watched over the fate of Rome and of the univerſe. The KING of the SACRIFICES repreſented the perſon of Numa, and of his ſucceſſors, in the religious functions, which could be performed only by royal hands. The confraternities of the SALIANS, the LUPERCALS, &amp;c. practiſed ſuch rites, as might extort a ſmile of contempt from every reaſonable man, with a lively confidence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending themſelves to the favour of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal gods. The authority, which the Roman prieſts had formerly obtained in the counſels of the republic, was gradually aboliſhed by the eſtabliſhment of monarchy, and the removal of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0034700105:102"/>
the ſeat of empire. But the dignity of their ſacred character was ſtill protected by the laws and manners of their country; and they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, more eſpecially the college of pontiffs, to exerciſe in the capital, and ſometimes in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, the rights of their eccleſiaſtical and civil juriſdiction. Their robes of purple, chariots of ſtate, and ſumptuous entertainments, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the admiration of the people; and they received, from the conſecrated lands, and the public revenue, an ample ſtipend, which liberally ſupported the ſplendour of the prieſthood, and all the expences of the religious worſhip of the ſtate. As the ſervice of the altar was not incompatible with the command of armies, the Romans, after their conſulſhips and triumphs, aſpired to the place of pontiff, or of augur; the ſeats of <note n="5" place="bottom">Cicero, frankly (ad Atticum, l. ii. epiſt. 5.), or indirectly (ad Familiar. l. xv. epiſt. 4.), confeſſes, that the <hi>Augurate</hi> is the ſupreme object of his wiſhes. Pliny is proud to tread in the footſteps of Cicero (l. iv. epiſt. 8.), and the chain of tradition might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from hiſtory, and marbles.</note> Cicero and Pompey were filled, in the fourth century, by the moſt illuſtrious members of the ſenate; and the dignity of their birth reflected additional ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour on their ſacerdotal character. The fifteen prieſts, who compoſed the college of pontiffs, enjoyed a more diſtinguiſhed rank as the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of their ſovereign; and the Chriſtian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors condeſcended to accept the robe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which were appropriated to the office of ſupreme pontiff. But when Gratian aſcended the throne, more ſcrupulous, or more enlightened,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0034700105:103"/>
he ſternly rejected thoſe prophane ſymbols <note n="6" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. iv. p. 249, 250. I have ſuppreſſed the fooliſh pun about <hi>Pontifex</hi> and <hi>Maximus.</hi>

Paganiſm was ſtill the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional religion of the ſenate. The hall, or temple, in which they aſſembled, was adorned by the ſtatue and altar of victory <note n="7" place="bottom">This ſtatue was tranſported from Tarentum to Rome, placed in the <hi>Guria Julia</hi> by Caeſar, and decorated by Auguſtus with the ſpoils of Egypt.</note>; a majeſtic female ſtanding on a globe, with flowing gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, expanded wings, and a crown of laurel in her out-ſtretched hand <note n="8" place="bottom">Prudentius (l. ii. in initio) has drawn a very awkward portrait of Victory: but the curious reader will obtain more ſatisfaction from Montfaucon's Antiquities (tom. i. p. 341.)</note>. The ſenators were ſworn on the altar of the goddeſs, to obſerve the laws of the emperor and of the empire; and a ſolemn offering of wine and incenſe was the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary prelude of their public deliberations <note n="9" place="bottom">See Suetonius (in Auguſt. c. 35.), and the Exordium of Pliny's Panegyric.</note>. The removal of this ancient monument was the only injury which Conſtantius had offered to the ſuperſtition of the Romans. The altar of Victory was again reſtored by Julian, tolerated by Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian, and once more baniſhed from the ſenate by the zeal of Gratian <note n="10" place="bottom">Theſe facts are mutually allowed by the two advocates, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus and Ambroſe.</note>. But the emperor yet
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0034700105:104"/>
ſpared the ſtatues of the gods which were expoſed to the public veneration: four hundred and twenty-four temples, or chapels, ſtill remained to ſatisfy the devotion of the people; and in every quarter of Rome, the delicacy of the Chriſtians was offended by the fumes of idolatrous ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <note n="11" place="bottom">The <hi>Notitia Urbis,</hi> more recent than Conſtantine, does not find one Chriſtian church worthy to be named among the edifices of the city.

            <p>But the Chriſtians formed the leaſt numerous party in the ſenate of Rome <note n="12" place="bottom">Ambroſe repeatedly affirms, in contradiction to common ſenſe (Moyle's Works, vol. ii. p. 147.), that the Chriſtians had a majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the ſenate.</note>; and it was only <note place="margin">Petition of the ſenate for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, A.

In that aſſembly, the dying  embers of freedom were, for a moment, revived and inflamed by the breath of fanaticiſm. Four reſpectable deputations were ſucceſſively voted to the Imperial court <note n="13" place="bottom">The <hi>firſt</hi> (A. D. 382.) to Gratian, who refuſed them audience. The <hi>ſecond</hi> (A.

Lardner (Heathen Teſtimonies, vol. iv. p. 372—399.) fairly repreſents the whole tranſaction.</note>, to repreſent the grievances of the prieſthood and the ſenate; and to ſolicit the reſtoration of the altar of Victory. The conduct of this important buſineſs was entruſted to the eloquent Symmachus <note n="14" place="bottom">Symmachus, who was inveſted with all the civil and ſacerdotal honours, repreſented the emperor under the two characters of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Princeps Senatûs.</hi> See the proud inſcription at the head of his works.</note>, a wealthy and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0034700105:105"/>
noble ſenator, who united the ſacred characters of pontiff and augur, with the civil dignities of proconſul of Africa, and praefect of the city. The breaſt of Symmachus was animated by the warmeſt zeal for the cauſe of expiring Paganiſm; and his religious antagoniſts lamented the abuſe of his genius, and the inefficacy of his moral virtues <note n="15" place="bottom">As if any one, ſays Prudentius (in Symmach, i. 639.), ſhould dig in the mud with an inſtrument of gold and ivory. Even ſaints, and polemic ſaints, treat this adverſary with reſpect and civility.</note>. The orator, whoſe petition is extant to the emperor Valentinian, was conſcious of the difficulty and danger of the office which he had aſſumed. He cautiouſly avoids every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; humbly declares, that prayers and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties are his only arms; and artfully draws his arguments from the ſchools of rhetoric, rather than from thoſe of philoſophy. Symmachus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſeduce the imagination of a young prince, by diſplaying the attributes of the goddeſs of victory; he inſinuates, that the confiſcation of the revenues, which were conſecrated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the gods, was a meaſure unworthy of his liberal and diſintereſted character; and he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that the Roman ſacrifices would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their force and energy, if they were no longer celebrated at the expence, as well as in the name, of the republic. Even ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm is made to ſupply an apology for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. The great and incomprehenſible

               <hi>ſecret</hi> of the univerſe eludes the enquiry of man. Where reaſon cannot inſtruct, cuſtom may be permitted to guide; and every nation ſeems to conſult the dictates of prudence, by a faithful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to thoſe rites, and opinions, which have received the ſanction of ages. If thoſe ages have been crowned with glory and proſperity, if the devout people has frequently obtained the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which they have ſolicited at the altars of the gods, it muſt appear ſtill more adviſable to perſiſt in the ſame ſalutary practice; and not to riſk the unknown perils that may attend any raſh innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The teſt of antiquity and ſucceſs was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with ſingular advantage to the religion of Numa; and ROME herſelf, the caeleſtial genius that preſided over the fates of the city, is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the orator to plead her own cauſe before the tribunal of the emperors. <q>"Moſt excellent princes," ſays the venerable matron, "fathers of your country! pity and reſpect my age, which has hitherto flowed in an uninterrupted courſe of piety.

            <p>But the hopes of Symmachus were repeatedly <note place="margin">Converſion of Rome. A.

In this controverſy, Ambroſe condeſcends to ſpeak the language of a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and to aſk, with ſome contempt, why it ſhould be thought neceſſary to introduce an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary and inviſible power, as the cauſe of thoſe victories, which were ſufficiently explained by the valour and diſcipline of the legions. He juſtly derides the abſurd reverence for antiquity, which could only tend to diſcourage the improvements of art, and to replunge the human race into their original barbariſm. From thence gradually riſing to a more lofty and theological tone, he pronounces, that Chriſtianity alone is the doctrine of truth and ſalvation; and that every mode of Polytheiſm conducts its deluded votaries, through the paths of error, to the abyſs of eternal perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="17" place="bottom">See Ambroſe (tom. ii. epiſt. xvii, xviii. p. 825—833.). The former of theſe epiſtles is a ſhort caution; the latter is a formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the petition or <hi>libel</hi> of Symmachus. The ſame ideas are more copiouſly expreſſed in the poetry, if it may deſerve that name, of Prudentius; who compoſed his two books againſt Symmachus (A. D. 404.) while that ſenator was ſtill alive. It is whimſical enough, that Monteſquieu (Conſiderations, &amp;c. c. xix. tom. iii. p. 487.) ſhould overlook the two profeſſed antagoniſts of Symmachus; and amuſe himſelf with deſcanting on the more remote and indirect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futations of Oroſius, St. Auguſtin, and Salvian.</note>.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0034700105:108"/>
Arguments like theſe, when they were ſuggeſted by a favourite biſhop, had power to prevent the reſtoration of the altar of Victory; but the ſame arguments fell, with much more energy and effect, from the mouth of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; and the gods of antiquity were dragged in triumph at the chariot-wheels of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius <note n="18" place="bottom">See Prudentius (in Symmach. l. i. 545, &amp;c.). The Chriſtian agrees with the Pagan Zoſimus (l. iv. p. 283.), in placing this viſit of Theodoſius after the <hi>ſecond</hi> civil war, gemini bis victor caede Tyranni (l. i. 410.).

A great number of plates of different metals, artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially joined together, compoſed the majeſtic figure of the Deity, who touched on either ſide the walls of the ſanctuary. The aſpect of Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis, his ſitting poſture, and the ſceptre, which he bore in his left hand, were extremely ſimilar to the ordinary repreſentations of Jupiter.

            <p>In the cruel reigns of Decius and Diocletian, <note place="margin">oppreſſed,</note> Chriſtianity had been proſcribed, as a revolt from the ancient and hereditary religion of the empire; and the unjuſt ſuſpicions which were entertained of a dark and dangerous faction, were, in ſome meaſure, countenanced by the inſeparable union, and rapid conqueſts, of the Catholic church. But the ſame excuſes of fear and ignorance cannot be applied to the Chriſtian emperors, who violated the precepts of humanity and of the goſpel. The experience of ages had betrayed the weakneſs, as well as folly, of Paganiſm; the light of reaſon and of faith had already expoſed, to the greateſt part of mankind, the vanity of idols; and the declining ſect, which ſtill adhered to their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, might have been permitted to enjoy, in peace and obſcurity, the religious cuſtoms of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.

Without much regard for truth or probability, they invented names for ſkeletons, and actions for names. The fame of the apoſtles, and of the holy men who had imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated their virtues, was darkened by religious fiction. To the invincible band of genuine and primitive martyrs, they added myriads of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary heroes, who had never exiſted, except in the fancy of crafty or credulous legendaries; and there is reaſon to ſuſpect, that Tours might not be the only dioceſe in which the bones of a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor were adored, inſtead of thoſe of a ſaint <note n="76" place="bottom">Martin of Tours (See his Life, c. 8. by Sulpicius Severus) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted this confeſſion from the mouth of the dead man.

In the reign of the younger Theodoſius, Lucian <note n="77" place="bottom">Lucian compoſed in Greek his original narrative, which has been tranſlated by Avitus, and publiſhed by Baronius (Annal.

A venerable figure ſtood before him, in the ſilence of the night, with a long beard, a white robe, and a gold rod; announced himſelf by the name of Gamaliel, and revealed to the aſtoniſhed preſbyter, that his own corpſe, with the bodies of his ſon Abibas, his friend Nicodemus, and the illuſtrious Stephen, the firſt martyr of the Chriſtian faith, were ſecretly buried in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent field.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0034700105:137"/>
was opened by the biſhop, in the preſence of an innumerable multitude. The coffins of Gamaliel, of his ſon, and of his friend, were found in regular order; but when the fourth coffin, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the remains of Stephen, was ſhewn to the light, the earth trembled, and an odour, ſuch as that of paradiſe, was ſmelt, which inſtantly cured the various diſeaſes of ſeventy-three of the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. The companions of Stephen were left in their peaceful reſidence of Caphargamala: but the relics of the firſt martyr were tranſported, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn proceſſion, to a church conſtructed in their honour on Mount Sion; and the minute particles of thoſe relics, a drop of blood <note n="78" place="bottom">A phial of St. Stephen's blood was annually liquefied at Naples, till he was ſuperſeded by St. Januarius (Ruinart.

            </head>
            <p>THE genius of Rome expired with Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius; the laſt of the ſucceſſors of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus and Conſtantine, who appeared in the field <note place="margin">Diviſion of the empire between Arcadius and Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, A. D. 395. Jan. 17.</note> at the head of their armies, and whoſe authority was univerſally acknowledged throughout the whole extent of the empire. The memory of his virtues ſtill continued, however, to protect the feeble and inexperienced youth of his two ſons. After the death of their father, Arcadius and Honorius were ſaluted, by the unanimous conſent of mankind, as the lawful emperors of the Eaſt, and of the Weſt; and the oath of fidelity was eagerly taken by every order of the ſtate; the ſenates of old and new Rome, the clergy, the magiſtrates, the ſoldiers, and the people. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadius, who then was about eighteen years of age, was born in Spain, in the humble habitation of a private family. But he received a princely education in the palace of Conſtantinople; and his inglorious life was ſpent in that peaceful and ſplendid ſeat of royalty, from whence he appeared to reign over the provinces of Thrace, Aſia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, from the Lower Danube to the confines of Perſia and Aethiopia. His younger brother, Honorius, aſſumed, in the eleventh year
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0034700105:146"/>
of his age, the nominal government of Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain, and Britain; and the troops, which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom, were oppoſed, on one ſide, to the Caledonians, and on the other to the Moors. The great and martial praefecture of Illyricum was divided between the two princes: the defence and poſſeſſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Noricum, Pannonia, and Dalmatia, ſtill belonged to the weſtern empire; but the two large dioceſes of Dacia and Macedonia, which Gratian had entruſted to the valour of Theodoſius, were for ever united to the empire of the Eaſt. The boundary in Europe was not very different from the line which now ſeparates the Germans and the Turks; and the reſpective advantages of territory, riches, populouſneſs, and military ſtrength, were fairly balanced and compenſated, in this final and permanent diviſion of the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The hereditary ſceptre of the ſons of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius appeared to be the gift of nature, and of their father; the generals and miniſters had been accuſtomed to adore the majeſty of the royal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; and the army and people were not admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of their rights, and of their power, by the dangerous example of a recent election. The gradual diſcovery of the weakneſs of Arcadius and Honorius, and the repeated calamities of their reign, were not ſufficient to obliterate the deep and early impreſſions of loyalty. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Rome, who ſtill reverenced the perſons, or rather the names, of their ſovereigns, beheld, with equal abhorrence, the rebels who oppoſed,

his paſſions were ſubſervient only to the paſſions of his maſter: yet, in the horrid maſſacre of Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica, the cruel Rufinus inflamed the fury, without imitating the repentance, of Theodoſius.

The two praefects were accuſed of rapine and corruption in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the laws and finances. For the trial of theſe illuſtrious offenders, the emperor conſtituted a ſpecial commiſſion: ſeveral judges were named to ſhare the guilt and reproach of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; but the right of pronouncing ſentence was reſerved to the preſident alone, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident was Rufinus himſelf. The father, ſtripped of the praefecture of the Eaſt, was thrown into a dungeon; but the ſon, conſcious that few mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can be found innocent, where an enemy is their judge, had ſecretly eſcaped; and Rufinus muſt have been ſatisfied with the leaſt obnoxious victim, if deſpotiſm had not condeſcended to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the baſeſt and moſt ungenerous artifice. The proſecution was conducted with an appearance of equity and moderation, which flattered Tatian with the hope of a favourable event; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence was fortified by the ſolemn aſſurances, and perfidious oaths, of the preſident, who preſumed to interpoſe the ſacred name of Theodoſius him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and the unhappy father was at laſt perſuaded to recal, by a private letter, the fugitive Proculus. He was inſtantly ſeized, examined, condemned, and beheaded, in one of the ſuburbs of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, with a precipitation which diſappointed

the clemency of the emperor. Without reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the misfortunes of a conſular ſenator, the cruel judges of Tatian compelled him to behold the execution of his ſon: the fatal cord was faſtened round his own neck; but in the moment when he expected, and perhaps deſired, the relief of a ſpeedy death, he was permitted to conſume the miſerable remnant of his old age in poverty and exile <note n="7" place="bottom">

The new praefect of the Eaſt (for Rufinus inſtantly ſucceeded to the vacant honours of his adverſary) was not diverted, however, by the moſt criminal purſuits, from the performance of the religious duties, which in that age were conſidered as the moſt eſſential to ſalvation. In the ſuburb of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon, ſurnamed the <hi>Oak,</hi> he had built a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent villa; to which he devoutly added a ſtately church; conſecrated to the apoſtles St. Peter and St. Paul, and continually ſanctified by the prayers, and pennance, of a regular ſociety of monks. A numerous, and almoſt general, ſynod of the biſhops of the eaſtern empire was ſummoned to celebrate, at the ſame time, the dedication of the church, and the baptiſm of the founder. This double ceremony was performed with extraordinary pomp; and when Rufinus was purified, in the holy font, from all the ſins that he had hitherto committed, a venerable hermit of Egypt raſhly propoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the ſponſor of a proud and ambitious ſtateſman <note n="9" place="bottom">Ammonius . . .

The

ambitious candidate eagerly ſolicited, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the faireſt part of his patrimony, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and emoluments of ſome provincial go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: the lives and fortunes of the unhappy people were abandoned to the moſt liberal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer; and the public diſcontent was ſometimes appeaſed by the ſacrifice of an unpopular criminal, whoſe puniſhment was profitable only to the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Eaſt, his accomplice and his judge. If avarice were not the blindeſt of the human paſſions, the motives of Rufinus might excite our curioſity; and we might be tempted to inquire, with what view he violated every principle of humanity and juſtice, to accumulate thoſe immenſe treaſures, which he could not ſpend without folly, nor poſſeſs without danger. Perhaps he vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that he laboured for the intereſt of an only daughter, on whom he intended to beſtow his royal pupil, and the auguſt rank of Empreſs of the Eaſt. Perhaps he deceived himſelf by the opinion, that his avarice was the inſtrument of his ambition.

Lucian proclaimed to the Eaſt, that the praefect, whoſe induſtry was much abated in the diſpatch of ordinary buſineſs, was active and indefatigable in the purſuit of revenge. Lucian, the ſon of the praefect Florentius, the oppreſſor of Gaul, and the enemy of Julian, had employed a conſiderable part of his inheritance, the fruit of rapine and corruption, to purchaſe the friendſhip of Rufinus, and the high office of Count of the Eaſt. But the new magiſtrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court, and of the times; diſgraced his benefactor, by the contraſt of a virtuous and temperate adminiſtration; and preſumed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe an act of injuſtice, which might have tended to the profit of the emperor's uncle. Arcadius was eaſily perſuaded to reſent the ſuppoſed inſult; and the praefect of the Eaſt reſolved to execute in perſon the cruel vengeance, which he meditated againſt this ungrateful delegate of his power. He performed with inceſſant ſpeed the journey of ſeven or eight hundred miles, from Conſtantinople to Antioch, entered the capital of Syria at the dead of night, and ſpread univerſal conſternation among a people, ignorant of his deſign, but not ignorant of his character. The count of the fifteen provinces of the Eaſt was dragged, like the vileſt malefactor, before the arbitrary tribunal of Rufinus. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the cleareſt evidence of his integrity, which was not impeached even by the voice of an accuſer, Lucian was condemned, almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a trial, to ſuffer a cruel and ignominious pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.

No ſooner had Rufinus perpetrated this inhuman act, the ſole object of his expedition, than he returned, amidſt the deep, and ſilent, curſes of a trembling people, from Antioch to Conſtantinople; and his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was accelerated, by the hope of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without delay, the nuptials of his daughter with the emperor of the Eaſt <note n="12" place="bottom">

While the praefect ſatiated his revenge at Antioch, a ſecret conſpiracy of the favourite eunuchs, directed by the great chamberlain Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius, undermined his power in the palace of Conſtantinople. They diſcovered that Arcadius was not inclined to love the daughter of Rufinus, who had been choſen, without his conſent, for his bride; and they contrived to ſubſtitute in her place the fair Eudoxia, the daughter of Bauto <note n="13" place="bottom">Zoſimus (l. iv. p. 243.) praiſes the valour, prudence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, of Bauto the Frank.

Soon after the return of Rufinus, the approaching ceremony of the royal nuptials was announced to the people of Conſtantinople, who prepared to celebrate, with falſe and hollow acclamations, the fortune of his daughter. A ſplendid train of eunuchs and officers iſſued, in hymeneal pomp, from the gates of the palace; bearing aloft the diadem, the robes, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable ornaments, of the future empreſs. The ſolemn proceſſion paſſed through the ſtreets of the city, which were adorned with garlands, and filled with ſpectators; but, when it reached the houſe of the ſons of Promotus, the principal eunuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully entered the manſion, inveſted the fair Eudoxia with the Imperial robes, and conducted her in triumph to the palace and bed of Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius <note n="15" place="bottom">This ſtory (Zoſimus, l. v. p. 290.) proves that the hymeneal rites of antiquity were ſtill practiſed, without idolatry, by the Chriſtians of the Eaſt; and the bride was <hi>forcibly</hi> conducted from the houſe of her parents to that of her huſband.

At the moment when he flattered himſelf that he ſhould become the father of a line of kings, a foreign maid, who had been educated in the houſe of his implacable enemies, was introduced into the Imperial bed; and Eudoxia ſoon diſplayed a ſuperiority of ſenſe and ſpirit, to improve the aſcendant which her beauty muſt acquire over the mind of a fond and youthful huſband. The emperor would ſoon be inſtructed to hate, to fear, and to deſtroy, the powerful ſubject, whom he had injured; and the conſciouſneſs of guilt deprived Rufinus of every hope, either of ſafety or comfort, in the retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a private life. But he ſtill poſſeſſed the moſt effectual means of defending his dignity, and perhaps of oppreſſing his enemies. The prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtill exerciſed an uncontrouled authority over the civil and military government of the Eaſt:

and his treaſures, if he could reſolve to uſe them, might be employed to procure proper inſtruments, for the execution of the blackeſt deſigns, that pride, ambition, and revenge, could ſuggeſt to a deſperate ſtateſman. The character of Rufinus ſeemed to juſtify the accuſations, that he conſpired againſt the perſon of his ſovereign, to ſeat himſelf on the vacant throne; and that he had ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the Huns, and the Goths, to invade the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the empire, and to increaſe the public confuſion. The ſubtle praefect, whoſe life had been ſpent in the intrigues of the palace, oppoſed, with equal arms, the artful meaſures of the eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch Eutropius; but the timid ſoul of Rufinus was aſtoniſhed by the hoſtile approach of a more formidable rival, of the great Stilicho, the general, or rather the maſter, of the empire of the Weſt <note n="16" place="bottom">Zoſimus (l. v. p. 290.), Oroſius (l. vii. c. 37.), and the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of Marcellinus.

The muſe of Claudian <note n="17" place="bottom">Stilicho, directly or indirectly, is the perpetual theme of Claudian.

ſupplied with authentic materials, we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to illuſtrate the annals of Honorius, from the invectives, or the panegyrics, of a contemporary writer; but as Claudian appears to have indulged the moſt ample privilege of a poet and a courtier, ſome criticiſm will be requiſite to tranſlate the language of fiction, or exaggeration, into the truth and ſimplicity of hiſtoric proſe. His ſilence concerning the family of Stilicho may be admitted as a proof, that his patron was neither able, nor deſirous, to boaſt of a long ſeries of illuſtrious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors; and the ſlight mention of his father, an officer of Barbarian cavalry, in the ſervice of Valens, ſeems to countenance the aſſertion, that the general, who ſo long commanded the armies of Rome, was deſcended from the ſavage and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious race of the Vandals <note n="18" place="bottom">Vandalorum, imbellis, avarae, perfidae, et doloſae, gentis, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere editus.

If Stilicho had not poſſeſſed the external advantages of ſtrength and ſtature, the moſt flattering bard, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſo many thouſand ſpectators, would have heſitated to affirm, that he ſurpaſſed the meaſure of the demi-gods of antiquity; and, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he moved, with lofty ſteps, through the ſtreets of the capital, the aſtoniſhed crowd made room for the ſtranger, who diſplayed, in a private condition, the awful majeſty of a hero. From his earlieſt youth he embraced the profeſſion of arms; his prudence and valour were ſoon diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the field; the horſemen and archers of the Eaſt admired his ſuperior dexterity; and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0034700105:160"/>
in each degree of his military promotions, the public judgment always prevented and approved the choice of the ſovereign. He was named by Theodoſius, to ratify a ſolemn treaty with the monarch of Perſia: he ſupported, during that important embaſſy, the dignity of the Roman name; and after his return to Conſtantinople, his merit was rewarded by an intimate and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alliance with the Imperial family. Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius had been prompted, by a pious motive of fraternal affection, to adopt, for his own, the daughter of his brother Honorius; the beauty and accompliſhments of Serena <note n="19" place="bottom">Claudian, in an imperfect poem, has drawn a fair, perhaps a flattering, portrait of Serena.

The prompt and unexpected obedience of the general of the Weſt, convinced the vulgar of his loyalty and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, as he had already engaged the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eaſtern troops, he recommended to their zeal the execution of his bloody deſign, which might be accompliſhed in his abſence, with leſs danger perhaps, and with leſs reproach. Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licho left the command of the troops of the Eaſt to Gainas, the Goth, on whoſe fidelity he firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied; with an aſſurance, at leaſt, that the hardy Barbarian would never be diverted from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by any conſideration of fear or remorſe. The ſoldiers were eaſily perſuaded to puniſh the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Stilicho, and of Rome; and ſuch was the general hatred which Rufinus had excited, that the fatal ſecret, communicated to thouſands, was faithfully preſerved during the long march from Theſſalonica to the gates of Conſtantinople. As ſoon as they had reſolved his death, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to flatter his pride; the ambitious prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was ſeduced to believe, that thoſe powerful auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head; and the treaſures which he diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a tardy and reluctant hand, were accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the indignant multitude, as an inſult, rather than as a gift. At the diſtance of a mile from the capital, in the field of Mars, before the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Hebdomon, the troops halted: and the emperor, as well as his miniſter, advanced, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ancient cuſtom, reſpectfully to ſalute the power which ſupported their throne. As Rufinus paſſed along the ranks, and diſguiſed,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0034700105:166"/>
with ſtudied courteſy, his innate haughtineſs, the wings inſenſibly wheeled from the right and left, and incloſed the devoted victim within the circle of their arms. Before he could reflect on the danger of his ſituation, Gainas gave the ſignal of death; a daring and forward ſoldier plunged his ſword into the breaſt of the guilty praefect, and Rufinus fell, groaned, and expired, at the feet of the affrighted emperor. If the agonies of a moment could expiate the crimes of a whole life, or if the outrages inflicted on a breathleſs corpſe could be the object of pity, our humanity might perhaps be affected by the horrid circumſtances which accompanied the murder of Rufinus. His mangled body was abandoned to the brutal fury of the populace of either ſex, who haſtened in crouds, from every quarter of the city, to trample on the remains of the haughty miniſter, at whoſe frown they had ſo lately trembled. His right hand was cut off, and carried through the ſtreets of Conſtantinople, in cruel mockery, to extort contributions for the avaricious tyrant, whoſe head was publicly expoſed, borne aloft on the point of a long lance <note n="31" place="bottom">The <hi>diſſection</hi> of Rufinus, which Claudian performs with the ſavage coolneſs of an anatomiſt (in Rufin. ii. 405—415.), is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpecified by Zoſimus and Jerom (tom. i. p. 26.).</note>.

The contemplation of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal order and harmony had ſatisfied Claudian of the exiſtence of the Deity; but the proſperous impunity of vice appeared to contradict his moral attributes; and the fate of Rufinus was the only event which could diſpel the religious doubts of the poet <note n="33" place="bottom">See the beautiful exordium of his invective againſt Rufinus, which is curiouſly diſcuſſed by the ſceptic Bayle, Dictionnaire Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, RUFIN.

In leſs than three months they were informed of the maxims of the new adminiſtration, by a ſingular edict, which eſtabliſhed the excluſive right of the treaſury over the ſpoils of Rufinus; and ſilenced, under heavy penalties, the preſumptuous claims of the ſubjects of the Eaſtern empire, who had

Even Stilicho did not derive from the murder of his rival, the fruit which he had propoſed; and though he gratified his revenge, his ambition was diſappointed. Under the name of a favourite, the weakneſs of Arcadius required a maſter; but he naturally preferred the obſequious arts of the eunuch Eutropius, who had obtained his domeſtic confidence; and the emperor contemplated, with terror and averſion, the ſtern genius of a foreign warrior. Till they were divided by the jealouſy of power, the ſword of Gainas, and the charms of Eudoxia, ſupported the favour of the great chamberlain of the palace: the perfidious Goth, who was appointed maſter-general of the Eaſt, betrayed, without ſcruple, the intereſt of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor; and the ſame troops, who had ſo lately maſſacred the enemy of Stilicho, were engaged to ſupport, againſt him, the independence of the throne of Conſtantinople. The favourites of Arcadius fomented a ſecret and irreconcileable war againſt a formidable hero, who aſpired to govern, and to defend, the two empires of Rome, and the two ſons of Theodoſius. They inceſſantly laboured, by dark and treacherous machinations, to deprive him of the eſteem of the prince, the reſpect of the people, and the friendſhip of the Barbarians. The life of Stilicho was repeatedly attempted by the dagger of hired aſſaſſins; and a decree was obtained, from the ſenate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,

to declare him an enemy of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, and to confiſcate his ample poſſeſſions in the provinces of the Eaſt. At a time when the only hope of delaying the ruin of the Roman name, depended on the firm union, and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aid, of all the nations to whom it had been gradually communicated, the ſubjects of Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius and Honorius were inſtructed, by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective maſters, to view each other in a foreign, and even hoſtile, light; to rejoice in their mutual calamities, and to embrace, as their faithful allies, the Barbarians, whom they excited to invade the territories of their countrymen <note n="35" place="bottom">See Claudian (i Conſ.

During thoſe twelve years, the provinces of Africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant, who ſeemed to unite the unfeeling temper of a ſtranger, with the partial reſentments of domeſtic faction. The forms of law were often ſuperſeded by the uſe of poiſon; and if the trembling gueſts, who were invited to the table of Gildo, preſumed to expreſs their fears, the inſolent ſuſpicion ſerved only to excite his fury, and he loudly ſummoned the miniſters of death.

Such profeſſions would not have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the maſter of the Roman world: but the death of Theodoſius, and the weakneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of his ſons, confirmed the power of the Moor; who condeſcended, as a proof of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to abſtain from the uſe of the diadem, and to ſupply Rome with the cuſtomary tribute, or rather ſubſidy, of corn. In every diviſion of the empire, the five provinces of Africa were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably aſſigned to the Weſt; and Gildo had conſented to govern that extenſive country in the name of Honorius; but his knowledge of the character and deſigns of Stilicho, ſoon engaged him to addreſs his homage to a more diſtant and feeble ſovereign.

The interruption, or at leaſt the diminution, of the ſubſidy, which the Goths had received from the prudent liberality of Theodoſius, was the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of their revolt: the affront was embittered by their contempt for the unwarlike ſons of Theodoſius; and their reſentment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by the weakneſs, or treachery, of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Arcadius.

The character of the civil and military officers, on whom Rufinus had devolved the government of Greece, confirmed the public ſuſpicion, that <note place="margin">Alaric marches into Greece, A.

The proconſul Antiochus was the unworthy ſon of a reſpectable  father; and Gerontius, who commanded the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial troops, was much better qualified to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the oppreſſive orders of a tyrant, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, with courage and ability, a country moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably fortified by the hand of nature. Alaric had traverſed, without reſiſtance, the plains of Macedonia and Theſſaly, as far as the foot of Mount Oeta, a ſteep and woody range of hills, almoſt impervious to his cavalry. They ſtretched from Eaſt to Weſt, to the edge of the ſea-ſhore; and left, between the precipice and the Malian Gulf, an interval of three hundred feet, which, in ſome places, was contracted to a road capable of admitting only a ſingle carriage <note n="6" place="bottom">Compare Herodotus (l. vii. c. 176.) and Livy (xxxvi. 15.).

Syneſius obſerves, and deplores the fatal abuſe,  which the imprudent bounty of the late emperor had introduced into the military ſervice. The citizens, and ſubjects, had purchaſed an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the indiſpenſable duty of defending
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0034700105:195"/>
their country; which was ſupported by the arms of Barbarian mercenaries. The fugitives of Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia were permitted to diſgrace the illuſtrious dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the empire; their ferocious youth, who diſdained the ſalutary reſtraint of laws, were more anxious to acquire the riches, than to imitate the arts, of a people, the object of their contempt and hatred; and the power of the Goths was the ſtone of Tantalus, perpetually ſuſpended over the peace and ſafety of the devoted ſtate. The meaſures, which Syneſius recommends, are the dictates of a bold and generous patriot. He exhorts the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to revive the courage of his ſubjects, by the example of manly virtue; to baniſh luxury from the court, and from the camp; to ſubſtitute, in the place of the Barbarian mercenaries, an army of men, intereſted in the defence of their laws and of their property; to force, in ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of public danger, the mechanic from his ſhop, and the philoſopher from his ſchool; to rouſe the indolent citizen from his dream of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to arm, for the protection of agriculture, the hands of the laborious huſbandman. At the head of ſuch troops, who might deſerve the name, and would diſplay the ſpirit, of Romans, he ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the ſon of Theodoſius to encounter a race of Barbarians, who were deſtitute of any real courage; and never to lay down his arms, till he had chaced them far away into the ſolitudes of Scythia; or had reduced them to the ſtate of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious ſervitude, which the Lacedaemonians formerly impoſed on the captive Helots <note n="21" place="bottom">Syneſius de Regno, p. 21—26.</note>. The
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0034700105:196"/>
court of Arcadius indulged the zeal, applauded the eloquence, and neglected the advice, of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſius. Perhaps the philoſopher, who addreſſes the emperor of the Eaſt, in the language of reaſon and virtue, which he might have uſed to a Spartan king, had not condeſcended to form a practicable ſcheme, conſiſtent with the temper, and circumſtances, of a degenerate age. Perhaps the pride of the miniſters, whoſe buſineſs was ſeldom interrupted by reflection, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as wild and viſionary, every propoſal, which exceeded the meaſure of their capacity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated from the forms and precedents of office. While the oration of Syneſius, and the downfal of the Barbarians, were the topics of popular conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, an edict was publiſhed at Conſtantinople, which declared the promotion of Alaric to the rank of maſter-general of the Eaſtern Illyricum. The Roman provincials, and the allies, who had reſpected the faith of treaties, were juſtly indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that the ruin of Greece and Epirus ſhould be ſo liberally rewarded. The Gothic conqueror was received as a lawful magiſtrate, in the cities which he had ſo lately beſieged. The fathers, whoſe ſons he had maſſacred, the huſbands, whoſe wives he had violated, were ſubject to his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and the ſucceſs of his rebellion encouraged the ambition of every leader of the foreign mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries. The uſe to which Alaric applied his new command, diſtinguiſhes the firm and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious character of his policy. He iſſued his orders to the four magazines and manufactures of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and defenſive arms, Margus, Ratiaria, Naiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,

and a numerous body of the cavalry of the Alani was perſuaded to engage in the ſervice of the emperor, who anxiouſly expected the return of his general. The prudence and vigour of Stili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho were conſpicuous on this occaſion, which revealed, at the ſame time, the weakneſs of the falling empire.

At the head of a choſen and intrepid vanguard, Stilicho ſwam the ſtream of the Addua, to gain the time which he muſt have loſt in the attack of the bridge; the paſſage of the Po was an enterpriſe of much leſs hazard and difficulty; and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful action, in which he cut his way through the Gothic camp under the walls of Aſta, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the hopes, and vindicated the honour, of Rome.

The capital was ſaved by the active and inceſſant diligence of Stilicho: but he reſpected the deſpair of his enemy; and, inſtead of committing the fate of the republic to the chance of another battle, he propoſed to purchaſe the abſence of the Barbarians. The ſpirit of Alaric would have rejected ſuch terms, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a retreat, and the offer of a penſion, with contempt and indignation; but he exerciſed a limited and precarious authority over the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent chieftains, who had raiſed him, for <hi>their</hi> ſervice, above the rank of his equals; they were ſtill leſs diſpoſed to follow an unſucceſsful gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and many of them were tempted to conſult their intereſt by a private negociation with the miniſter of Honorius.

Ignorant of the treaſon, which had already betrayed his bold and judicious enterpriſe, he advanced towards the paſſes of the mountains, already poſſeſſed by the Imperial troops; where he was expoſed, almoſt at the ſame inſtant, to a general attack in the front, on his flanks, and in the rear. In this bloody action, at a ſmall diſtance from the walls of Verona, the loſs of the Goths was not leſs heavy than that which they had ſuſtained in the defeat of Pollentia; and their valiant king, who eſcaped by the ſwiftneſs of his horſe, muſt either have been ſlain or made priſoner, if the haſty raſhneſs of the Alani had not diſappointed the meaſures of the Roman general. Alaric ſecured the remains of his army on the adjacent rocks; and prepared himſelf, with undaunted reſolution, to maintain a ſiege againſt the ſuperior numbers of the enemy, who inveſted him on all ſides. But he could not oppoſe the deſtructive progreſs of hunger and diſeaſe; nor was it poſſible for him to check the continual deſertion of his impatient and capricious Barbarians.

This naval eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, which included the arſenals and maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, the barracks of the troops, and the houſes of the artificers, derived its origin and name from the permanent ſtation of the Roman fleet; the intermediate ſpace was ſoon filled with buildings and inhabitants, and the three extenſive and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous quarters of Ravenna gradually contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to form one of the moſt important cities of Italy. The principal canal of Auguſtus poured a copious ſtream of the waters of the Po through the midſt of the city, to the entrance of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; the ſame waters were introduced into the profound ditches that encompaſſed the walls; they were diſtributed, by a thouſand ſubordinate canals, into every part of the city, which they divided into a variety of ſmall iſlands; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was maintained only by the uſe of boats and bridges; and the houſes of Ravenna, whoſe appearance may be compared to that of Venice, were raiſed on the foundation of wooden piles.

The gradual retreat of the ſea has left the modern city at the diſtance of four miles from the Hadriatic; and as early as the fifth or ſixth century of the Chriſtian aera, the port of Auguſtus was converted into pleaſant orchards; and a lonely grove of pines covered the ground where the Roman fleet once rode at anchor <note n="62" place="bottom">The fable of Theodore and Honoria, which Dryden has ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably tranſplanted from Bocaccio (Giornata iii. novell. viii.) was acted in the wood of <hi>Chiaſſi,</hi> a corrupt word from <hi>Claſſis,</hi> the naval ſtation, which, with the intermediate road or ſuburb, the <hi>Via Caeſaris,</hi> conſtituted the <hi>triple</hi> city of Ravenna.</note>.

The Chineſe annals, as they have been interpreted by the learned induſtry of the preſent age, may be uſefully applied to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the ſecret and remote cauſes of the fall of the Roman empire.

The Topa ſoon compelled the paſtoral nations of the eaſtern deſert to acknowledge the ſuperiority of

their arms; they invaded China in a period of weakneſs and inteſtine diſcord; and theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Tartars, adopting the laws and manners of the vanquiſhed people, founded an Imperial dynaſty, which reigned near one hundred and ſixty years over the northern provinces of the monarchy. Some generations before they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the throne of China, one of the Topa princes had enliſted in his cavalry a ſlave of the name of Moko, renowned for his valour; but who was tempted, by the fear of puniſhment, to deſert his ſtandard, and to range the deſert at the head of an hundred followers.

The examples of Caeſar muſt have been familiar to the moſt illiterate of the Roman warriors; and the fortifications of Dyrra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium, which connected twenty-four caſtles, by a perpetual ditch and rampart of fifteen miles, afforded the model of an intrenchment which might confine, and ſtarve, the moſt numerous hoſt of Barbarians <note n="78" place="bottom">

The only oppoſition which was made to the authority of Conſtantine, proceeded not ſo much from the powers of government, or the ſpirit of the people, as from the private zeal and intereſt of the family of Theodoſius. Four brothers <note n="98" place="bottom">Verinianus, Didymus, Theodoſius, and Lagodius, who, in modern courts, would be ſtyled princes of the blood, were not diſtinguiſhed by any rank or privileges above the reſt of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubjects.</note> had obtained,

Such were the feeble arms which decided the poſſeſſion of the Weſtern provinces of Europe, from the wall of Antoninus to the columns of Hercules. The events of peace and war have undoubtedly been diminiſhed by the narrow and imperfect view of the hiſtorians of the times, who were equally ignorant of the cauſes, and of the effects, of the moſt important revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

this unfortunate expedition, the king of the Goths muſt indeed have ſuſtained a conſiderable loſs; and his haraſſed forces required an interval of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to recruit their numbers, and revive their confidence. Adverſity had exerciſed, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, the genius of Alaric; and the fame of his valour invited, to the Gothic ſtandard, the braveſt of the Barbarian warriors; who, from the Euxine to the Rhine, were agitated by the deſire of rapine and conqueſt. He had deſerved the eſteem, and he ſoon accepted the friendſhip, of Stilicho himſelf. Renouncing the ſervice of the emperor of the Eaſt, Alaric concluded, with the court of Ravenna, a treaty of peace and alliance, by which he was declared maſter-general of the Roman armies throughout the praefecture of Illyricum; as it was claimed, according to the true and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient limits, by the miniſter of Honorius <note n="101" place="bottom">Theſe dark tranſactions are inveſtigated by the Count de Buat (Hiſt. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. vii. c. iii—viii. p. 69—206.), whoſe laborious accuracy may ſometimes fatigue a ſuperficial reader.</note>. The execution of the ambitious deſign, which was either ſtipulated, or implied, in the articles of the treaty, appears to have been ſuſpended by the formidable irruption of Radagaiſus; and the neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality of the Gothic king may perhaps be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the indifference of Caeſar, who, in the conſpiracy of Catiline, refuſed either to aſſiſt, or to oppoſe, the enemy of the republic. After the defeat of the Vandals, Stilicho reſumed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to the provinces of the Eaſt; appointed civil magiſtrates for the adminiſtration of juſtice,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0034700105:243"/>
and of the finances; and declared his impatience to lead, to the gates of Conſtantinople, the united armies of the Romans and of the Goths. The prudence however of Stilicho, his averſion to civil war, and his perfect knowledge of the weakneſs of the ſtate, may countenance the ſuſpicion, that domeſtic peace, rather than foreign conqueſt, was the object of his policy; and, that his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal care was to employ the forces of Alaric at a diſtance from Italy. This deſign could not long eſcape the penetration of the Gothic king, who continued to hold a doubtful, and perhaps a treacherous correſpondence, with the rival courts; who protracted, like a diſſatisfied mercenary, his languid operations in Theſſaly and Epirus, and who ſoon returned to claim the extravagant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his ineffectual ſervices.

            <p>The political and ſecret tranſactions of two ſtateſmen, who laboured to deceive each other <note place="margin">Debates of the Roman ſenate, A.

The neceſſity of finding ſome arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſupport for a government, which, from a principle, not of moderation, but of weakneſs, was reduced to negociate with its own ſubjects, had inſenſibly revived the authority of the Roman ſenate: and the miniſter of Honorius reſpectfully conſulted the legiſlative council of the republic. Stilicho aſſembled the ſenate in the palace of the Caeſars; repreſented, in a ſtudied oration, the actual ſtate of affairs; propoſed the demands of the Gothic king, and ſubmitted to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the choice of peace or war. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, as if they had been ſuddenly awakened from a dream of four hundred years, appeared on this important occaſion to be inſpired by the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, rather than by the wiſdom, of their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. They loudly declared, in regular ſpeeches, or in tumultuary acclamations, that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the majeſty of Rome, to purchaſe a precarious and diſgraceful truce from a Barbarian king; and that, in the judgment of a magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous people, the chance of ruin was always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to the certainty of diſhonour. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0034700105:245"/>
whoſe pacific intentions were ſeconded only by the voices of a few ſervile and venal followers, attempted to allay the general ferment, by an apology for his own conduct, and even for the demands of the Gothic prince. <q>"The payment of a ſubſidy, which had excited the indignation of the Romans, ought not (ſuch was the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Stilicho) to be conſidered in the odious light, either of a tribute, or of a ranſom, extorted by the menaces of a Barbarian enemy. Alaric had faithfully aſſerted the juſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the republic to the provinces which were uſurped by the Greeks of Conſtantinople: he modeſtly required the fair and ſtipulated recompence of his ſervices; and if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted from the proſecution of his enterpriſe, he had obeyed, in his retreat, the peremptory, though private, letters of the emperor himſelf. Theſe contradictory orders (he would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the errors of his own family) had been procured by the interceſſion of Serena. The tender piety of his wife had been too deeply affected by the diſcord of the royal brothers, the ſons of her adopted father; and the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature had too eaſily prevailed over the ſtern dictates of the public welfare."</q> Theſe oſtenſible reaſons, which faintly diſguiſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure intrigues of the palace of Ravenna, were ſupported by the authority of Stilicho; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, after a warm debate, the reluctant appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the ſenate. The tumult of virtue and freedom ſubſided; and the ſum of four thouſand pounds of gold was granted, under the name of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0034700105:246"/>
a ſubſidy, to ſecure the peace of Italy, and to conciliate the friendſhip of the king of the Goths. Lampadius alone, one of the moſt illuſtrious members of the aſſembly, ſtill perſiſted in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; exclaimed with a loud voice, <q>"This is not a treaty of peace, but of ſervitude <note n="103" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. v. p. 338, 339.

            <p>But the reign of Stilicho drew towards its end; and the proud miniſter might perceive the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms <note place="margin">Intrigues of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, A.

The generous  boldneſs of Lampadius had been applauded; and the ſenate, ſo patiently reſigned to a long ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, rejected with diſdain the offer of invidious and imaginary freedom. The troops, who ſtill aſſumed the name and prerogatives of the Roman legions, were exaſperated by the partial affection of Stilicho for the Barbarians: and the people im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the miſchievous policy of the miniſter, the public misfortunes, which were the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their own degeneracy. Yet Stilicho might have continued to brave the clamours of the people, and even of the ſoldiers, if he could have maintained his dominion over the feeble mind of his pupil. But the reſpectful attachment of Honorius was converted into fear, ſuſpicion, and hatred. The crafty Olympius <note n="104" place="bottom">He came from the coaſt of the Euxine, and exerciſed a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did office, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. His actions juſtify his character, which Zoſimus (l. v. p. 340.) expoſes with viſible ſatisfaction. Auguſtin revered the piety of Olympius, whom he ſtyles a true ſon of the church (Baronius, Annal. Eccleſ. A. D. 408. No 19, &amp;c. Tillemont, Mem. Eccleſ. tom. xiii. p. 467, 468.). But theſe praiſes, which the African ſaint ſo unworthily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows, might proceed, as well from ignorance, as from adulation.</note>, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed

his vices under the maſk of Chriſtian piety, had ſecretly undermined the benefactor, by whoſe favour he was promoted to the honourable offices of the Imperial palace. Olympius revealed to the unſuſpecting emperor, who had attained the twenty-fifth year of his age, that he was without weight, or authority, in his own government; and artfully alarmed his timid and indolent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition by a lively picture of the deſigns of Stili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, who already meditated the death of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, with the ambitious hope of placing the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem on the head of his ſon Eucherius. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was inſtigated, by his new favourite, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the tone of independent dignity; and the miniſter was aſtoniſhed to find, that ſecret reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions were formed in the court and council, which were repugnant to his intereſt, or to his intentions. Inſtead of reſiding in the palace of Rome, Honorius declared, that it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to return to the ſecure fortreſs of Ravenna. On the firſt intelligence of the death of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arcadius, he prepared to viſit Conſtantinople, and to regulate, with the authority of a guardian, the provinces of the infant Theodoſius <note n="105" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. v. p. 338, 339. Sozomen, l. ix. c. 4. Stilicho offered to undertake the journey to Conſtantinople, that he might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Honorius from the vain attempt. The Eaſtern empire would not have obeyed, and could not have been conquered.</note>. The
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0034700105:248"/>
repreſentation of the difficulty and expence of ſuch a diſtant expedition, checked this ſtrange and ſudden ſally of active diligence; but the dangerous project of ſhewing the emperor to the camp of Pavia, which was compoſed of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man troops, the enemies of Stilicho, and his Barbarian auxiliaries, remained fixed and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable. The miniſter was preſſed, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his confident Juſtinian, a Roman advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, of a lively and penetrating genius, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a journey ſo prejudicial to his reputation and ſafety. His ſtrenuous, but ineffectual, efforts confirmed the triumph of Olympius; and the prudent lawyer withdrew himſelf from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ruin of his patron.</p>
            <p>In the paſſage of the emperor through Bologna, <note place="margin">Diſgrace and death of Stilicho, A. D. 408, Aug. 23.</note> a mutiny of the guards was excited and appeaſed by the ſecret policy of Stilicho; who announced  his inſtructions to decimate the guilty, and aſcribed to his own interceſſion the merit of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. After this tumult, Honorius embraced, for the laſt time, the miniſter whom he now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a tyrant, and proceeded on his way to camp of Pavia; where he was received by the loyal acclamations of the troops who were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled for the ſervice of the Gallic war. On the morning of the fourth day, he pronounced, as he had been taught, a military oration in the preſence of the ſoldiers, whom the charitable viſits, and artful diſcourſes, of Olympius had prepared to execute a dark and bloody conſpiracy. At the firſt ſignal, they maſſacred the friends of Stilicho, the moſt illuſtrious officers of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0034700105:249"/>
two Praetorian praefects, of Gaul, and of Italy; two maſters-general, of the cavalry, and infantry; the maſter of the offices; the quaeſtor, the treaſurer, and the count of the domeſtics. Many lives were loſt; many houſes were plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the furious ſedition continued to rage till the cloſe of the evening; and the trembling em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who was ſeen in the ſtreets of Pavia, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his robes or diadem, yielded to the perſuaſions of his favourite; condemned the memory of the ſlain; and ſolemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of their aſſaſſins. The intelligence of the maſſacre of Pavia filled the mind of Stilicho with juſt and gloomy apprehenſions: and he inſtantly ſummoned, in the camp of Bologna, a council of the confederate leaders, who were attached to his ſervice, and would be involved in his ruin. The impetuous voice of the aſſembly called aloud for arms, and for revenge; to march, without a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's delay, under the banners of a hero, whom they had ſo often followed to victory; to ſurpriſe, to oppreſs, to extirpate the guilty Olympius, and his degenerate Romans; and perhaps to fix the diadem on the head of their injured general. Inſtead of executing a reſolution, which might have been juſtified by ſucceſs, Stilicho heſitated till he was irrecoverably loſt. He was ſtill igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the fate of the emperor; he diſtruſted the fidelity of his own party; and he viewed with horror the fatal conſequences of arming a crowd of licentious Barbarians, againſt the ſoldiers and people of Italy. The confederates, impatient of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0034700105:250"/>
his timorous and doubtful delay, haſtily retired, with fear and indignation. At the hour of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, Sarus, a Gothic warrior, renowned among the Barbarians themſelves for his ſtrength and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſuddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor, plundered the baggage, cut in pieces the faithful Huns, who guarded his perſon, and penetrated to the tent, where the miniſter, penſive and ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, meditated on the dangers of his ſituation. Stilicho eſcaped with difficulty from the ſword of the Goths; and, after iſſuing a laſt and generous admonition to the cities of Italy, to ſhut their gates againſt the Barbarians, his confidence, or his deſpair, urged him to throw himſelf into Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna, which was already in the abſolute poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his enemies. Olympius, who had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the dominion of Honorius, was ſpeedily informed, that his rival had embraced, as a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant, the altar of the Chriſtian church. The baſe and cruel diſpoſition of the hypocrite was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of pity or remorſe; but he piouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to elude, rather than to violate, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of the ſanctuary. Count Heraclian, with a troop of ſoldiers, appeared, at the dawn of day, before the gates of the church of Ravenna. The biſhop was ſatisfied by a ſolemn oath, that the Imperial mandate only directed them to ſecure the perſon of Stilicho: but, as ſoon as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate miniſter had been tempted beyond the holy threſhold, he produced the warrant for his inſtant execution. Stilicho ſupported, with calm reſignation, the injurious names of traitor and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0034700105:251"/>
parricide; repreſſed the unſeaſonable zeal of his followers, who were ready to attempt an inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual reſcue; and, with a firmneſs not unworthy of the laſt of the Roman generals, ſubmitted his neck to the ſword of Heraclian <note n="105" place="bottom">Zoſimus (l. v. p. 336—345.) has copiouſly, though not clearly, related the diſgrace and death of Stilicho.

His family, united by a triple alliance with the family of Theodoſius, might envy the condition of the meaneſt peaſant.

            <p>Among the train of dependents, whoſe wealth <note place="margin">The poet Claudian.</note> and dignity attracted the notice of their own times, <hi>our</hi> curioſity is excited by the celebrated name of the poet Claudian, who enjoyed the favour of Stilicho, and was overwhelmed in the ruin of his patron. The titular offices of tribune and notary fixed his rank in the Imperial court: he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the powerful interceſſion of Serena for his marriage with a very rich heireſs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Africa <note n="113" place="bottom">At the nuptials of Orpheus (a modeſt compariſon!) all the parts of animated nature contributed their various gifts; and the gods themſelves enriched their favourite. Claudian had neither flocks, nor herds, nor vines, or olives. His wealthy bride was heireſs to them all. But he carried to Africa, a recommendatory letter from Serena, his Juno, and was made happy (Epiſt. ii. ad Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renam).</note>; and the ſtatue of Claudian, erected in the forum of Trajan, was a monument of the taſte and liberality of the Roman ſenate <note n="114" place="bottom">Claudian feels the honour like a man who deſerved it (in praefat. Bell. Get.). The original inſcription, on marble, was found at Rome, in the fifteenth century, in the houſe of Pomponius Laetus. The ſtatue of a poet, far ſuperior to Claudian, ſhould have been erected, during his life-time, by the men of letters, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and contemporaries. It was a noble deſign!</note>. After the praiſes of Stilicho became offenſive and criminal, Claudian was expoſed to the enmity of a powerful and unforgiving courtier, whom he had provoked by the inſolence of wit. He had compared, in a lively epigram, the oppoſite cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of two Praetorian praefects of Italy; he contraſts the innocent repoſe of a philoſopher, who ſometimes reſigned the hours of buſineſs to

ſlumber, perhaps to ſtudy; with the intereſted diligence of a rapacious miniſter, indefatigable in the purſuit of unjuſt, or ſacrilegious gain. <q>"How happy, continues Claudian, how happy might it be for the people of Italy, if Mallius could be conſtantly awake, and if Hadrian would always ſleep <note n="115" place="bottom">

The poet concealed himſelf, however, during the tumult of the revolution; and, conſulting the dictates of prudence rather than of honour, he addreſſed, in the form of an epiſtle, a ſuppliant and humble recantation to the offended praefect. He deplores, in mournful ſtrains, the fatal indiſcretion into which he had been hurried by paſſion and folly; ſubmits to the imitation of his adverſary, the generous examples of the clemency of gods, of heroes, and of lions; and expreſſes his hope, that the magnanimity of Hadrian will not trample on a defenceleſs and contemptible foe, already humbled by diſgrace

Yet, in ſome places, an air of irony and indignation betrays his ſecret reluctance.</note>. Whatever might be the ſucceſs of his prayer, or the accidents of his future life, the period of a few years levelled in the grave the miniſter and the poet; but the name of Hadrian is almoſt ſunk in oblivion, while Claudian is read with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in every country which has retained, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, the knowledge of the Latin language. If we fairly balance his merits and his defects, we ſhall acknowledge, that Claudian does not either ſatisfy, or ſilence, our reaſon. It would not be eaſy to produce a paſſage that deſerves the epithet of ſublime or pathetic; to ſelect a verſe, that melts the heart, or enlarges the imagination. We ſhould vainly ſeek, in the poems of Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, the happy invention, and artificial conduct, of an intereſting fable; or the juſt and lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the characters and ſituations of real life. For the ſervice of his patron, he publiſhed occaſional panegyrics and invectives: and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of theſe ſlaviſh compoſitions encouraged his propenſity to exceed the limits of truth and nature. Theſe imperfections, however, are compenſated in ſome degree by the poetical virtues of Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. He was endowed with the rare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious talent of raiſing the meaneſt, of adorning the moſt barren, and of diverſifying the moſt ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, topics: his colouring, more eſpecially in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive poetry, is ſoft and ſplendid; and he

To theſe commendations, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of any accidents of time and place, we muſt add the peculiar merit which Claudian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the unfavourable circumſtances of his birth. In the decline of arts, and of empire, a native of Egypt <note n="117" place="bottom">National vanity has made him a Florentine, or a Spaniard.

The Gothic prince would have ſubſcribed with pleaſure the edict which the fanaticiſm of Olympius dictated to the ſimple and devout emperor. Honorius excluded all perſons, who were adverſe to the catholic church, from holding any office in the ſtate; obſtinately rejected the ſervice of all thoſe who diſſented from his religion; and raſhly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified many of his braveſt and moſt ſkilful officers, who adhered to the Pagan worſhip, or who had imbibed the opinions of Arianiſm <note n="3" place="bottom">Eos qui catholicae ſectae ſunt inimici, intra palatium militare prohibemus.

This law was applied in the utmoſt latitude, and rigorouſly executed. Zoſimus, l. v. p. 364.</note>. Theſe meaſures, ſo advantageous to an enemy, Alaric would have approved, and might perhaps have ſuggeſted; but it may ſeem doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Barbarian would have promoted his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt at the expence of the inhuman and abſurd cruelty, which was perpetrated by the direction, or at leaſt with the connivance, of the Imperial miniſters. The foreign auxiliaries, who had been attached to the perſon of Stilicho, lamented his death; but the deſire of revenge was checked by a natural apprehenſion for the ſafety of their
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0034700105:260"/>
wives and children; who were detained as hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages in the ſtrong cities of Italy, where they had likewiſe depoſited their moſt valuable effects. At the ſame hour, and as if by a common ſignal, the cities of Italy were polluted by the ſame horrid ſcenes of univerſal maſſacre and pillage, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, in promiſcuous deſtruction, the families and fortunes of the Barbarians. Exaſperated by ſuch an injury, which might have awakened the tameſt and moſt ſervile ſpirit, they caſt a look of indignation and hope towards the camp of Alaric, and unanimouſly ſwore to purſue, with juſt and implacable war, the perfidious nation, that had ſo baſely violated the laws of hoſpitality. By the imprudent conduct of the miniſters of Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, the republic loſt the aſſiſtance, and deſerved the enmity, of thirty thouſand of her braveſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: and the weight of that formidable army, which alone might have determined the event of the war, was transferred from the ſcale of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans into that of the Goths.</p>
            <p>In the arts of negociation, as well as in thoſe of war, the Gothic king maintained his ſuperior <note place="margin">Alaric marches to Rome, A. D. 408, Oct. &amp;c.</note> aſcendant over an enemy, whoſe ſeeming changes  proceeded from the total want of counſel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. From his camp, on the confines of Italy, Alaric attentively obſerved the revolutions of the palace, watched the progreſs of faction and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, diſguiſed the hoſtile aſpect of a Barbarian invader, and aſſumed the more popular appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho; to whoſe virtues, when they were no longer formidable, he could pay a juſt tribute of ſincere
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0034700105:261"/>
praiſe and regret. The preſſing invitation of the malcontents, who urged the king of the Goths to invade Italy, was enforced by a lively ſenſe of his perſonal injuries; and he might ſpeciouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that the Imperial miniſters ſtill delayed and eluded the payment of the four thouſand pounds of gold; which had been granted by the Roman ſenate, either to reward his ſervices, or to appeaſe his fury. His decent firmneſs was ſupported by an artful moderation, which contributed to the ſucceſs of his deſigns. He required a fair and reaſonable ſatisfaction; but he gave the ſtrongeſt aſſurances, that, as ſoon as he had obtained it, he would immediately retire. He refuſed to truſt the faith of the Romans, unleſs Aetius and Jaſon, the ſons of two great officers of ſtate, were ſent as hoſtages to his camp: but he offered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, in exchange, ſeveral of the nobleſt youths of the Gothic nation. The modeſty of Alaric was interpreted, by the miniſters of Ravenna, as a ſure evidence of his weakneſs and fear. They diſdained either to negociate a treaty, or to aſſemble an army; and with a raſh confidence, derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger, irretrievably waſted the deciſive moments of peace and war. While they expected, in ſullen ſilence, that the Barbarians ſhould evacuate the confines of Italy, Alaric, with bold and rapid marches, paſſed the Alps and the Po; haſtily pillaged the cities of Aquileia, Altinum, Concordia, and Cremona, which yielded to his arms; increaſed his forces by the acceſſion of thirty thouſand
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0034700105:262"/>
auxiliaries; and, without meeting a ſingle enemy in the field, advanced as far as the edge of the moraſs which protected the impregnable reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the emperor of the Weſt. Inſtead of attempting the hopeleſs ſiege of Ravenna, the prudent leader of the Goths proceeded to Rimini, ſtretched his ravages along the ſea-coaſt of the Hadriatic, and meditated the conqueſt of the ancient miſtreſs of the world. An Italian her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, whoſe zeal and ſanctity were reſpected by the Barbarians themſelves, encountered the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious monarch, and boldly denounced the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of heaven againſt the oppreſſors of the earth: but the ſaint himſelf was confounded by the ſolemn aſſeveration of Alaric, that he felt a ſecret and praeternatural impulſe, which directed, and even compelled, his march to the gates of Rome. He felt, that his genius and his fortune were equal to the moſt arduous enterpriſes; and the enthuſiaſm which he communicated to the Goths, inſenſibly removed the popular, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſuperſtitious, reverence of the nations for the majeſty of the Roman name. His troops, animated by the hopes of ſpoil, followed the courſe of the Flaminian way, occupied the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded paſſes of the Apennine <note n="4" place="bottom">Addiſon (ſee his Works, vol. ii. p. 54. edit.

In the beginning of the war, the Roman people conſiſted of two hundred and fifty thouſand citizens of an age to bear arms <note n="9" place="bottom">In the three <hi>cenſus</hi> which were made of the Roman people, about the time of the ſecond Punic war, the numbers ſtand as follows (ſee Livy, Epitom. l. xx. Hiſt. l. xxvii. 36. xxix. 37.), 270, 213, 137, 108, 214,000. The fall of the ſecond, and the riſe of the third, appears ſo enormous, that ſeveral critics, notwithſtanding the unanimity of the MSS. have ſuſpected ſome corruption of the text of Livy. (See Drakenborch ad xxvii. 36. and Beaufort, Republique Romaine, tom. i. p. 325.) They did not conſider that the ſecond <hi>cenſus</hi> was taken only at Rome, and that the numbers were diminiſhed, not only by the death, but likewiſe by the <hi>abſence,</hi> of many ſoldiers. In the third <hi>cenſus,</hi> Livy expreſsly affirms, that the legions were muſtered by the care of particular commiſſaries. From the numbers on the liſt, we muſt always deduct one twelfth above threeſcore, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of bearing arms. See Population de la France, p. 72.</note>. Fifty thouſand had already died in the defence of their country; and the twenty-three legions which were employed in the different camps of Italy, Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, and Spain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired about one hundred thouſand men. But there ſtill remained an equal number in Rome, and the adjacent territory, who were animated by the ſame intrepid courage; and every citizen was trained, from his earlieſt youth, in the diſcipline and exerciſes of a ſoldier.

I ſuſpect that they were both managed by the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable policy of the ſenate.</note>. He led his Africans to the gates of Rome, where he found three armies in order of battle, prepared to receive him; but Hannibal dreaded the event of a combat, from which he could not hope to eſcape, unleſs he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the laſt of his enemies; and his ſpeedy retreat confeſſed the invincible courage of the Romans.</p>

The genealogy of her father, Rogatus, which aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as high as Agamemnon, might ſeem to betray a Grecian origin; but her mother, Blaeſilla, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the Scipios, Aemilius Paulus, and the Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi, in the liſt of her anceſtors; and Toxotius, the huſband of Paula, deduced his royal lineage from Aeneas, the father of the Julian line. The vanity of the rich, who deſired to be noble, was gratified by theſe lofty pretenſions.

Compared to this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a thouſand or fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds of gold might be conſidered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian rank, which required many expences of a public and oſtentatious kind.

This popular eſtimation allows ſome latitude; but it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to explain a law in the Theodoſian Code (l. vi. leg. 5.), which fixes the expence of the firſt praetor at 25,000, of the ſecond at 20,000, and of the third at 15,000 <hi>folles.</hi> The name of <hi>follis</hi> (ſee Mem. de l'Academie des Inſcriptions, tom. xxviii. p. 727.) was equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a purſe of 125 pieces of ſilver, and to a ſmall copper coin of the value of 1/2625 part of that purſe.

            <p>The opulent nobles of an immenſe capital, <note place="margin">Their manners.</note> who were never excited by the purſuit of military glory, and ſeldom engaged in the occupations of civil government, naturally reſigned their leiſure to the buſineſs and amuſements of private life.

Yet it appears from the Theodoſian Code (ſee Godefroy ad l. ii. tit. xxxiii. tom. i. p. 230—289.), that they were permitted to take ſix per cent. or one half of the legal intereſt; and, what is more ſingular, this permiſſion was granted to the <hi>young</hi> ſenators.</note>. A conſiderable maſs of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure muſt always have exiſted at Rome, either in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and ſilver plate; and there were many ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards in the time of Pliny, which contained more ſolid ſilver, than had been tranſported by Scipio from vanquiſhed Carthage <note n="32" place="bottom">Plin.

The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the nobles, who diſſipated their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in profuſe luxury, found themſelves poor in the midſt of wealth; and idle in a conſtant round of diſſipation. Their deſires were continually gratified by the labour of a thouſand hands; of the numerous train of their domeſtic ſlaves, who were actuated by the fear of puniſhment; and of the various profeſſions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain.

Hoſpitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every ſtranger, who could plead either merit or misfortune, was relieved, or rewarded, by their generoſity. At preſent, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to one of the proud and wealthy ſenators, he is welcomed indeed in the firſt audience, with ſuch warm profeſſions, and ſuch kind enquiries, that he retires, enchanted with the affability of his illuſtrious friend, and full of regret that he had ſo long delayed his journey to Rome, the native ſeat of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as well as of empire. Secure of a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reception, he repeats his viſit the enſuing day, and is mortified by the diſcovery, that his perſon, his name, and his country, are already forgotten. If he ſtill has reſolution to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents, and obtains the permiſſion to pay his aſſiduous and unprofitable court to a haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty patron, incapable of gratitude or friendſhip; who ſcarcely deigns to remark his preſence, his departure, or his return.

But the coſtly inſtruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous lyres, and hydraulic organs, are conſtructed for their uſe; and the harmony of vocal and inſtrumental muſic is inceſſantly repeated in the palaces of Rome. In thoſe palaces, ſound is preferred to ſenſe, and the care of the body to that of the mind.

The diſtreſs which follows and chaſtiſes extravagant luxury, often reduces the great to the uſe of the moſt humiliating expedients. When they deſire to borrow, they employ the baſe and ſupplicating ſtyle of the ſlave in the comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they aſſume the royal and tragic declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the grandſons of Hercules.

From the morning to the evening, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the ſun, or of the rain, the ſpectators, who ſometimes amounted to the number of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horſes and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear, for the ſucceſs of the <hi>colours</hi> which they eſpouſed: and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Rome appeared to hang on the event of a race <note n="60" place="bottom">Juvenal.

The daily allowance of three pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn ſtill continued to riſe in a rapid and extravagant proportion. The poorer citizens, who were unable to purchaſe the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life, ſolicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public miſery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at Rome, and conſecrated, to the uſe of the indigent, the princely revenue, which ſhe annually received from the grateful ſucceſſors of her huſband <note n="74" place="bottom">The mother of Laeta was named Piſſumena.

The ſtern features of Alaric were inſenſibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length conſented to raiſe the ſiege, on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate payment of five thouſand pounds of gold, of thirty thouſand pounds of ſilver, of four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand robes of ſilk, of three thouſand pieces of fine ſcarlet cloth, and of three thouſand pounds weight of pepper <note n="78" place="bottom">Pepper was a favourite ingredient of the moſt expenſive Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cookery, and the beſt ſort commonly ſold for fifteen denarii, or ten ſhillings, the pound.

It was brought from India; and the ſame country, the coaſt of Malabar, ſtill affords the greateſt plenty: but the improvement of trade and navigation has multiplied the quantity, and reduced the price. See Hiſtoire Politique et Philoſophique, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 457.</note>. But the public treaſury was exhauſted; the annual rents of the great eſtates in Italy and the provinces, were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vileſt ſuſtenance; the hoards of ſecret wealth were ſtill concealed by the obſtinacy of avarice; and ſome remains of conſecrated ſpoils afforded the only reſource that could avert the impending ruin of the city. As ſoon as the Romans had ſatisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0034700105:304"/>
in ſome meaſure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty. Several of the gates were cautiouſly opened; the importation of proviſions from the river, and the adjacent country, was no longer obſtructed by the Goths; the citizens reſorted in crowds to the free market, which was held during three days in the ſuburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade, made a conſiderable profit, the future ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the city was ſecured by the ample magazines which were depoſited in the public and private granaries. A more regular diſcipline, than could have been expected, was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wiſe Barbarian juſtified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the juſt ſeverity with which he chaſtiſed a party of licentious Goths, who had inſulted ſome Roman citizens on the road to Oſtia. His army, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by the contributions of the capital, ſlowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuſcany, where he propoſed to eſtabliſh his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-quarters; and the Gothic ſtandard became the refuge of forty thouſand Barbarian ſlaves, who had broke their chains, and aſpired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries, and the diſgrace, of their cruel ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. About the ſame time, he received a more honourable reinforcement of Goths and Huns, whom Adolphus <note n="79" place="bottom">This Gothic chieftain is called by Jornandes and Iſidore, <hi>Athaulphus;</hi> by Zoſimus and Oroſius, <hi>Ataulphus;</hi> and by Olympio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus, <hi>Adaoulphus.</hi> I have uſed the celebrated name of <hi>Adolphus,</hi> which ſeems to be authoriſed by the practice of the Swedes, the ſons or brothers of the ancient Goths.</note>, the brother of his wife,

A victorious leader, who unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the daring ſpirit of a Barbarian with the art and diſcipline of a Roman general, was at the head of an hundred thouſand fighting men; and Italy pronounced, with terror and reſpect, the formidable name of Alaric <note n="80" place="bottom">The treaty between Alaric and the Romans, &amp;c. is taken from Zoſimus, l. v. p. 354, 355. 358, 359. 362, 363.

In the midſt of his apparent proſperity, Alaric was conſcious, perhaps, of ſome ſecret weakneſs, ſome internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he diſplayed, was intended only to deceive and diſarm the eaſy credulity of the miniſters of Honorius. The king of the Goths repeatedly declared, that it was his deſire to be conſidered as the friend of peace, and of the Romans. Three ſenators, at his earneſt requeſt, were ſent ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to the court of Ravenna, to ſolicit the exchange of hoſtages, and the concluſion of the treaty; and the propoſals, which he more clearly expreſſed during the courſe of the negociations, could only inſpire a doubt of his ſincerity, as they might ſeem inadequate to the ſtate of his fortune. The Barbarian ſtill aſpired to the rank
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0034700105:306"/>
of maſter-general of the armies of the Weſt; he ſtipulated an annual ſubſidy of corn and money; and he choſe the provinces of Dalmatia, Nori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, and Venetia, for the ſeat of his new king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which would have commanded the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant communication between Italy and the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube. If theſe modeſt terms ſhould be rejected, Alaric ſhewed a diſpoſition to relinquiſh his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary demands, and even to content himſelf with the poſſeſſion of Noricum; an exhauſted and impoveriſhed country, perpetually expoſed to the inroads of the Barbarians of Germany <note n="81" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. v. p. 367, 368, 369.</note>. But the hopes of peace were diſappointed by the weak obſtinacy, or intereſted views, of the miniſter Olympius. Without liſtening to the ſalutary remonſtrances of the ſenate, he diſmiſſed their ambaſſadors under the conduct of a military eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence. Six thouſand Dalmatians, the flower of the Imperial legions, were ordered to march from Ravenna to Rome, through an open country, which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the Barbarians. Theſe brave legionaries, encompaſſed and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fell a ſacrifice to miniſterial folly; their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Valens, with an hundred ſoldiers, eſcaped from the field of battle; and one of the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchaſe his freedom with a ranſom of thirty thouſand pieces of gold.

The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of Honorius, and the empire, to Jovius, the Praetorian praefect; an unworthy ſervant, who did not atone, by the merit of perſonal attachment, for the errors and misfortunes of his adminiſtration. The exile, or eſcape, of the guilty Olympius, reſerved him for more viciſſitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obſcure and wandering life; he again roſe to power; he fell a ſecond time into diſgrace; his ears were cut off; he expired under the laſh; and his ignominious death afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a grateful ſpectacle to the friends of Stilicho. After the removal of Olympius, whoſe character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticiſm, the Pagans and heretics were delivered from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic proſcription, which excluded them from the dignities of the ſtate.

Very different were the ſentiments of the council of Carthage, who deputed four biſhops to the court of Ravenna, to complain of the law, which had been juſt enacted, that all converſions to Chriſtianity ſhould be free and voluntary.

a ſoldier of Barbarian origin, who ſtill adhered to the worſhip of his anceſtors, had been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lay aſide the military belt: and though he was repeatedly aſſured by the emperor himſelf, that laws were not made for perſons of his rank or merit, he refuſed to accept any partial diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and perſevered in honourable diſgrace, till he had extorted a general act of juſtice from the diſtreſs of the Roman government. The conduct of Gennerid, in the important ſtation, to which he was promoted or reſtored, of maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, ſeemed to revive the diſcipline and ſpirit of the republic. From a life of idleneſs and want, his troops were ſoon habituated to ſevere exerciſe, and plentiful ſubſiſtence; and his private generoſity often ſupplied the rewards, which were denied by the avarice, or poverty, of the court of Ravenna. The valour of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerid, formidable to the adjacent Barbarians, was the firmeſt bulwark of the Illyrian frontier; and his vigilant care aſſiſted the empire with a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of ten thouſand Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of proviſions, and ſuch a numerous train of ſheep and oxen, as might have been ſufficient, not only for the march of an army, but for the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0034700105:309"/>
ſettlement of a colony. But the court and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of Honorius ſtill remained a ſcene of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtraction, of corruption and anarchy. Inſtigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards roſe in furious mutiny, and demanded the heads of two generals, and of the two principal eunuchs. The generals, under a perfidious promiſe of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were ſent on ſhip-board, and privately exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and ſecure exile at Milan and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople. Euſebius the eunuch, and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian Allobich, ſucceeded to the command of the bed-chamber and of the guards; and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual jealouſy of theſe ſubordinate miniſters was the cauſe of their mutual deſtruction. By the inſolent order of the count of the domeſtics, the great chamberlain was ſhamefully beaten to death with ſticks, before the eyes of the aſtoniſhed emperor; and the ſubſequent aſſaſſination of Allobich, in the midſt of a public proceſſion, is the only circumſtance of his life, in which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius diſcovered the fainteſt ſymptom of courage or reſentment. Yet before they fell, Euſebius and Allobich had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire, by oppoſing the concluſion of a treaty which Jovius, from a ſelfiſh, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a criminal, motive, had negociated with Alaric, in a perſonal interview under the walls of Rimini. During the abſence of Jovius, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was perſuaded to aſſume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, ſuch as neither his ſituation, nor his character, could enable him to ſupport: and a letter, ſigned with the name of Honorius,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0034700105:310"/>
was immediately diſpatched to the Praetorian praefect, granting him a free permiſſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the public money, but ſternly refuſing to proſtitute the military honours of Rome to the proud demands of a Barbarian. This letter was imprudently communicated to Alaric himſelf; and the Goth, who in the whole tranſaction had behaved with temper and decency, expreſſed, in the moſt outrageous language, his lively ſenſe of the inſult ſo wantonly offered to his perſon, and to his nation. The conference of Rimini was haſtily interrupted; and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the faſhionable opinions of the court. By his advice and example, the principal officers of the ſtate and army were obliged to ſwear, that, without liſtening, in <hi>any</hi> circumſtances, to <hi>any</hi> conditions of peace, they would ſtill perſevere in perpetual and implacable war againſt the enemy of the republic. This raſh engagement oppoſed an inſuperable bar to all future negociation. The miniſters of Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius were heard to declare, that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the public ſafety, and truſt their ſouls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had ſworn, by the ſacred head of the emperor himſelf; they had touched, in ſolemn ceremony, that auguſt ſeat of majeſty and wiſdom; and the violation of their oath would expoſe them to the temporal penalties of ſacrilege and rebellion <note n="85" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. v. p. 367, 368, 369. This cuſtom of ſwearing by the head, or life, or ſafety, or genius, of the ſovereign, was of the higheſt antiquity, both in Egypt (Geneſis xlii. 15.) and Scythia. It was ſoon transferred, by flattery, to the Caeſars; and Tertullian complains, that it was the only oath which the Romans of his time affected to reverence.

The artificial moles, which formed the narrow entrance, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced far into the ſea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largeſt veſſels ſecurely rode at anchor within three deep and capacious baſons, which received the northern branch of the Tyber, about two miles from the ancient colony of Oſtia <note n="88" place="bottom">The <hi>Oſtia Tyberina</hi> (ſee Cluver.

The clamours of that people, and the terror of famine, ſubdued the pride of the ſenate; they liſtened, without reluctance, to the propoſal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the ſuffrage of the Gothic conqueror beſtowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0034700105:314"/>
majeſty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of Egypt and the Eaſt, which had once acknowledged the ſovereignty of Rome.

But the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, with their uſual levity, applauded the change of maſters. The public diſcontent was favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the rival of Honorius; and the ſectaries, oppreſſed by his perſecuting edicts, expected ſome degree of countenance, or at leaſt of toleration, from a prince, who, in his native country of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, had been educated in the Pagan ſuperſtition, and who had ſince received the ſacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm from the hands of an Arian biſhop <note n="91" place="bottom">We may admit the evidence of Sozomen for the Arian baptiſm, and that of Philoſtorgius for the Pagan education, of Attalus. The viſible joy of Zoſimus, and the diſcontent which he imputes to the Anician family, are very unfavourable to the Chriſtianity of the new emperor.</note>. The firſt days of the reign of Attalus were fair and proſperous. An officer of confidence was ſent with an inconſiderable body of troops to ſecure the obedience of Africa; the greateſt part of Italy ſubmitted to the terror of the Gothic powers; and though the city of Bologna made a vigorous and effectual reſiſtance, the people of Milan, diſſatisfied perhaps with the abſence of Honorius, accepted, with loud acclamations, the choice of the Roman ſenate. At the head of a formidable army, Alaric conducted his royal cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0034700105:315"/>
almoſt to the gates of Ravenna; and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn embaſſy of the principal miniſters, of Jovius, the Praetorian praefect, of Valens, maſter of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaeſtor Potamius, and of Julian, the firſt of the notaries, was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, with martial pomp, into the Gothic camp. In the name of their ſovereign, they conſented to acknowledge the lawful election of his, competitor, and to divide the provinces of Italy and the Weſt between the two emperors. Their propoſals were rejected with diſdain; and the refuſal was aggravated by the inſulting cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of Attalus, who condeſcended to promiſe, that, if Honorius would inſtantly reſign the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſhould be permitted to paſs the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of ſome remote iſland <note n="92" place="bottom">He carried his inſolence ſo far, as to declare, that he ſhould mutilate Honorius before he ſent him into exile. But this aſſertion of Zoſimus is deſtroyed by the more impartial teſtimony of Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piodorus, who attributes the ungenerous propoſal (which was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely rejected by Attalus) to the baſeneſs, and perhaps the treachery, of Jovius.</note>. So deſperate indeed did the ſituation of the ſon of Theodoſius appear, to thoſe who were the beſt acquainted with his ſtrength and reſources, that Jovius and Valens, his miniſter and his general, betrayed their truſt, infamouſly deſerted the ſinking cauſe of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the ſervice of his more fortunate rival. Aſtoniſhed by ſuch examples of domeſtic treaſon, Honorius trembled at the approach of every ſervant, at the arrival of every meſſenger. He dreaded the ſecret ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0034700105:316"/>
who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bed-chamber; and ſome ſhips lay ready in the harbour of Ravenna, to tranſport the abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>But there <hi>is</hi> a Providence (ſuch at leaſt was the opinion of the hiſtorian Procopius <note n="93" place="bottom">Procop. de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. 2.</note>) that watches <note place="margin">He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded by Alaric, A. D. 410.</note> over innocence and folly; and the pretenſions of Honorius to its peculiar care cannot reaſonably be diſputed. At the moment when his deſpair, incapable of any wiſe or manly reſolution, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated a ſhameful flight, a ſeaſonable reinforcement of four thouſand veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna. To theſe valiant ſtrangers, whoſe fidelity had not been corrupted by the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city; and the ſlumbers of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror were no longer diſturbed by the apprehenſion of imminent and internal danger. The favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able intelligence which was received from Africa, ſuddenly changed the opinions of men, and the ſtate of public affairs. The troops and officers, whom Attalus had ſent into that province, were defeated and ſlain; and the active zeal of Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clian maintained his own allegiance, and that of his people. The faithful count of Africa tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a large ſum of money, which fixed the attachment of the Imperial guards; and his vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, in preventing the exportation of corn and oil, introduced famine, tumult, and diſcontent, into the walls of Rome. The failure of the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0034700105:317"/>
African expedition, was the ſource of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus; and the mind of his protector was inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly alienated from the intereſt of a prince, who wanted ſpirit to command, or docility to obey. The moſt imprudent meaſures were adopted, without the knowledge, or againſt the advice, of Alaric; and the obſtinate refuſal of the ſenate, to allow, in the embarkation, the mixture even of five hundred Goths, betrayed a ſuſpicious and diſtruſtful temper, which, in their ſituation, was neither generous nor prudent.

In a large plain near Rimini, and in the preſence of an innumerable multitude of Romans and Barbarians, the wretched Attalus was publicly deſpoiled of the diadem and purple; and thoſe enſigns of royalty were ſent by Alaric, as the pledge of peace and friendſhip, to the ſon of Theodoſius <note n="94" place="bottom">See the cauſe and circumſtances of the fall of Attalus in Zoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, l. vi. p. 380—383.

to reſpect the churches of the apoſtles St. Peter and St. Paul, as holy and inviolable ſanctuaries.

According to Iſidore, Alaric himſelf was heard to ſay, that he waged war with the Romans, and not with the Apoſtles.

From the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill, to the diſtant quarter of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal ſtreets, protected, with glittering arms, the long train of their devout compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who bore aloft, on their heads, the ſacred veſſels of gold and ſilver; and the martial ſhouts of the Barbarians were mingled with the ſound of religious pſalmody.

In the ſack of Rome, ſome rare and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary examples of Barbarian virtue had been <note place="margin">Pillage and fire of Rome.</note> deſervedly applauded. But the holy precincts of the Vatican, and the apoſtolic churches, could receive a very ſmall proportion of the Roman people: many thouſand warriors, more eſpecially of the Huns, who ſerved under the ſtandard of Alaric, were ſtrangers to the name, or at leaſt to the faith, of Chriſt; and we may ſuſpect, without any breach of charity or candour, that, in the hour of ſavage licence, when every paſſion was inflamed, and every reſtraint was removed, the precepts of the goſpel ſeldom influenced the behaviour of the Gothic Chriſtians.

of the public diſorder, he ſhared the dominion, and the plunder, of Gaul and Spain; with the tribes of Barbarians, whoſe deſtructive progreſs was no longer checked by the Rhine or Pyrenees. Stained with the blood of the kinſmen of Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, he extorted, from the court of Ravenna, with which he ſecretly correſponded, the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his rebellious claims. Conſtantine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf, by a ſolemn promiſe, to deliver Italy from the Goths; advanced as far as the banks of the Po; and after alarming, rather than aſſiſting, his puſillanimous ally, haſtily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate, with intemperate luxury, his vain and oſtentatious triumph. But this tranſient proſperity was ſoon interrupted and deſtroyed by the revolt of count Gerontius, the braveſt of his generals; who, during the abſence of his ſon Conſtans, a prince already inveſted with the Imperial purple, had been left to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the provinces of Spain. For ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, inſtead of aſſuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his reſidence at Tarragona, while the active count preſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, through the Pyrenees, to ſurpriſe the two emperors, Conſtantine and Conſtans, before they could prepare for their defence. The ſon was made priſoner at Vienna, and immediately put to death; and the unfortunate youth had ſcarcely leiſure to deplore the elevation of his family; which had tempted, or compelled him, ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly to deſert the peaceful obſcurity of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtic life. The father maintained a ſiege within

the walls of Arles; but thoſe walls muſt have yielded to the aſſailants, had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian army. The name of Honorius, the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a lawful emperor, aſtoniſhed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending parties of the rebels. Gerontius, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by his own troops, eſcaped to the confines of Spain; and reſcued his name from oblivion, by the Roman courage which appeared to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the laſt moments of his life. In the middle of the night, a great body of his perfidious ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſurrounded, and attacked his houſe, which he had ſtrongly barricaded. His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſlaves, were ſtill attached to his perſon; and he uſed, with ſo much ſkill and reſolution, a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above three hundred of the aſſailants loſt their lives in the attempt. His ſlaves, when all the miſſile weapons were ſpent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been reſtrained by conjugal tenderneſs, might have imitated their example; till the ſoldiers, provoked by ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate reſiſtance, applied fire on all ſides to the houſe. In this fatal extremity, he complied with the requeſt of his Barbarian friend, and cut off his head. The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of miſery and diſgrace, eagerly preſented her neck to his ſword; and the tragic ſcene was terminated by the death of the count himſelf, who, after three ineffectual ſtrokes, drew a ſhort dagger, and ſheathed it in

The unprotected Maximus, whom he had inveſted with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.

In the familiar intercourſe of private life, his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he ſometimes diſdain, in the licence of convivial mirth, to vie
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0034700105:353"/>
with the pantomimes themſelves, in the exerciſes of their ridiculous profeſſion. But when the trumpet ſummoned him to arms; when he mounted his horſe, and, bending down (for ſuch was his ſingular practice) almoſt upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, Conſtantius then ſtruck terror into his foes, and inſpired his ſoldiers with the aſſurance of victory. He had received from the court of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna the important commiſſion of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the Weſt; and the pretended emperor Conſtantine, after enjoying a ſhort and anxious reſpite, was again beſieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy. Yet this interval allowed time for a ſucceſsful negociation with the Franks and Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni; and his ambaſſador, Edobic, ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, at the head of an army, to diſturb the operations of the ſiege of Arles. The Roman general, inſtead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wiſely, reſolved to paſs the Rhône, and to meet the Barbarians. His meaſures were conducted with ſo much ſkill and ſecrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of Conſtantius in the front, they were ſuddenly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, ſurrounded, and deſtroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had ſilently gained an advantageous poſt in their rear. The remains of the army of Edobic were preſerved by flight or ſubmiſſion, and their leader eſcaped from the field of battle to the houſe of a faithleſs friend; who too clearly underſtood, that the head of his
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0034700105:354"/>
obnoxious gueſt would be an acceptable and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative preſent for the Imperial general. On this occaſion, Conſtantius behaved with the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of a genuine Roman. Subduing, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, every ſentiment of jealouſy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and ſervices of Ulphilas: but he turned with horror from the aſſaſſin of Edobic; and ſternly intimated his commands, that the camp ſhould no longer be polluted by the preſence of an ungrateful wretch, who had violated the laws of friendſhip and hoſpitality. The uſurper, who beheld, from the walls of Arles, the ruin of his laſt hopes, was tempted to place ſome confidence in ſo generous a conqueror. He required a ſolemn promiſe for his ſecurity; and after receiving, by the impoſition of hands, the ſacred character of a Chriſtian Preſbyter, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to open the gates of the city. But he ſoon experienced, that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Conſtantius, were ſuperſeded by the looſe doctrines of political morality.

rapid ſucceſſion of uſurpers, regardleſs of the fate of their predeceſſors, ſtill continued to ariſe. This miſchief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of Spain and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguiſhed by war and rebellion. Before Conſtantine reſigned the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the fourth month of the ſiege of Arles, intelligence was received in the Imperial camp, that Jovinus had aſſumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the inſtigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate, on whom they had beſtowed the empire, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, with a formidable hoſt of Barbarians, from the banks of the Rhine to thoſe of the Rhône. Every circumſtance is dark and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in the ſhort hiſtory of the reign of Jovinus. It was natural to expect, that a brave and ſkilful general, at the head of a victorious army, would have aſſerted, in a field of battle, the juſtice of the cauſe of Honorius. The haſty retreat of Conſtantius might be juſtified by weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but he reſigned, without a ſtruggle, the poſſeſſion of Gaul: and Dardanus, the Praetorian praefect, is recorded as the only magiſtrate, who refuſed to yield obedience to the uſurper <note n="152" place="bottom">Sidonius Apollinaris (l. v. epiſt. 9. p. 139. and Not.

When the Goths, two years after the ſiege of Rome, eſtabliſhed their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to ſuppoſe that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reſerved in their camp for the occaſional purpoſe of acting the part of a muſician or a monarch. Yet in a moment of diſguſt (for which it is not eaſy to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign a cauſe, or a date), Adolphus connected himſelf with the uſurper of Gaul; and impoſed on Attalus the ignominious taſk of negociating the treaty, which ratified his own diſgrace. We are again ſurpriſed to read, that, inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Gothic alliance as the firmeſt ſupport of his throne, Jovinus upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, ſcorning the advice of his great ally, he inveſted with the purple his brother Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian; and that he moſt imprudently accepted the ſervice of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the ſoldier of Honorius, was provoked to deſert the court of a prince, who knew not how to reward, or puniſh. Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who eſteemed the duty of revenge as the moſt precious and ſacred portion of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, advanced with a body of ten thouſand Goths to encounter the hereditary enemy of the houſe of Balti. He attacked Sarus at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded moment, when he was accompanied only by eighteen or twenty of his valiant followers. United by friendſhip, animated by deſpair, but

The death of Sarus diſſolved the looſe alliance which Adolphus ſtill maintained with the uſurpers of Gaul. He again liſtened to the dictates of love and prudence; and ſoon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the brother of Placidia, by the aſſurance that he would immediately tranſmit, to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Ravenna, the heads of the two tyrants, Jovinus and Sebaſtian. The king of the Goths executed his promiſe without difficulty or delay: the helpleſs brothers, unſupported by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal merit, were abandoned by their Barbarian auxiliaries; and the ſhort oppoſition of Valentia was expiated by the ruin of one of the nobleſt cities of Gaul. The emperor, choſen by the Roman ſenate, who had been promoted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded, inſulted, reſtored, again degraded, and again inſulted, was finally abandoned to his fate: but when the Gothic king withdrew his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was reſtrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the perſon of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus. The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without ſubjects or allies, embarked in one of the ports of Spain, in ſearch of ſome ſecure and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary

The ſame meaſure of puniſhment, with which, in the days of his proſperity, he was accuſed of menacing his rival, was inflicted on Attalus himſelf: he was condemned, after the amputation of two fingers, to a perpetual exile in the iſle of Lipari, where he was ſupplied with the decent neceſſaries of life. The remainder of the reign of Honorius was undiſturbed by rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; and it may be obſerved, that, in the ſpace of five years, ſeven uſurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince, who was himſelf incapable either of counſel or of action.</p>

The footſteps of the Barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were ſoon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian aera, the cities of Emerita or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the moſt illuſtrious of the Roman

The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and manufactured by the ſkill of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval ſtores contributed to ſupport an extenſive and profitable trade <note n="154" place="bottom">Without recurring to the more ancient writers, I ſhall quote three reſpectable teſtimonies which belong to the fourth and ſeventh centuries; the Expoſitio totius Mundi (p. 16. in the third volume of Hudſon's Minor Geographers), Auſonius (de Claris Urbibus, p. 242. edit.

The arts and ſciences flouriſhed under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the Spaniards was enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by peace and ſervitude, the hoſtile approach of the Germans, who had ſpread terror and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation from the Rhine to the Pyrenees, ſeemed to rekindle ſome ſparks of military ardour. As long as the defence of the mountains was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they ſucceſsfully repelled the frequent attempts of the Barbarians. But no ſooner had the national troops been compelled to reſign their poſt to the Honorian bands, in the ſervice of Conſtantine; than the gates of Spain were trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the ſack of Rome by the Goths <note n="155" place="bottom">The date is accurately fixed in the Faſti, and the Chronicle of Idatius.

The misfortunes of Spain may be deſcribed in the language of its moſt eloquent hiſtorian, who has conciſely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the paſſionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers <note n="156" place="bottom">Idatius wiſhes to apply the Prophecies of Daniel to theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional calamities; and is therefore obliged to accommodate the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the event to the terms of the prediction.</note>. <q>"The irruption of theſe nations was followed by the moſt dreadful calamities: as the Barbarians exerciſed their indiſcriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the Romans and the Spaniards; and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country. The progreſs of famine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the miſerable inhabitants to feed on the fleſh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beaſts, who multiplied, without controul, in the deſert, were exaſperated, by the taſte of blood, and the impatience of hunger, boldly to attack and devour their human prey. Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence ſoon appeared, the inſeparable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of famine; a large proportion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was ſwept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their ſurviving friends. At length the Barbarians, ſatiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themſelves had introduced, fixed their permanent ſeats in the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0034700105:361"/>
depopulated country. The ancient Gallicia, whoſe limits included the kingdom of Old Caſtille, was divided between the Suevi and the Vandals; the Alani were ſcattered over the provinces of Carthagena and Luſitania, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of Boetica was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the Vandalic nation. After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new ſubjects ſome reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by a captive people. The greateſt part of the Spaniards was even diſpoſed to prefer this new condition of poverty and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm, to the ſevere oppreſſions of the Roman government: yet there were many who ſtill aſſerted their native freedom; and who refuſed, more eſpecially in the mountains of Gallicia, to ſubmit to the Barbarian yoke <note n="157" place="bottom">Mariana de Rebus Hiſpanicis, l. v. c. 1. tom. i. p. 148.

In this diſpoſition, the ſucceſſor of Adolphus no longer refuſed to liſten to a Roman ambaſſador, whoſe propoſals were enforced by the real, or ſuppoſed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Conſtantius.

The Spaniſh war was obſtinately ſupported, during three campaigns, with deſperate valour, and various ſucceſs; and the martial atchievements of Wallia diffuſed through the empire the ſuperior renown of the Gothic hero. He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Boetica. He ſlew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of thoſe Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian wanderers, who eſcaped from the field, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of chuſing a new leader, humbly ſought a refuge under the ſtandard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded. The Vandals themſelves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous multitude of Barbarians, whoſe retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Gallicia; where they ſtill continued, in a narrow compaſs, and on a barren ſoil, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their domeſtic and implacable hoſtilities.

While the event of the war was ſtill doubtful, the firſt advantages obtained by the

The palace of Conſtantinople rivalled, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps excelled, the magnificence of Perſia; and the eloquent ſermons of St. Chryſoſtom <note n="1" place="bottom">Father Montſaucon, who, by the command of his Benedictine ſuperiors, was compelled (ſee Longueruana, tom. i. p. 205.) to execute the laborious edition of St. Chryſoſtom, in thirteen volumes in folio (Paris, 1738.), amuſed himſelf with extracting from that immenſe collection of morals, ſome curious <hi>antiquities,</hi> which illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the manners of the Theodoſian age (See Chryſoſtom.

while they condemn, the pompous luxury of the reign of Arcadius. <q>"The emperor," ſays he, "wears on his head either a diadem, or a crown of gold, decorated with precious ſtones of ineſtimable value. Theſe ornaments, and his purple garments, are reſerved for his ſacred perſon alone; and his robes of ſilk are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with the figures of golden dragons. His throne is of maſſy gold. Whenever he appears in public, he is ſurrounded by his courtiers, his guards, and his attendants. Their ſpears, their ſhields, their cuiraſſes, the bridles and trappings of their horſes, have either the ſubſtance, or the appearance, of gold; and the large ſplendid boſs in the midſt of their ſhield, is encircled with ſmaller boſſes, which repreſent the ſhape of the human eye. The two mules that draw the chariot of the monarch, are perfectly white, and ſhining all over with gold. The chariot itſelf, of pure and ſolid gold, attracts the admiration of the ſpectators, who contemplate the purple cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the ſnowy carpet, the ſize of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, and the reſplendent plates of gold, that glitter as they are agitated by the motion of the carriage. The Imperial pictures are white, on a blue ground; the emperor appears ſeated on his throne, with his arms, his horſes, and his guards beſide him; and his vanquiſhed enemies in chains at his feet."</q> The ſucceſſors of Conſtantine eſtabliſhed their perpetual reſidence in the royal city, which he

Inacceſſible to the menaces of their enemies, and perhaps to the complaints of their people, they received, with each wind, the tributary produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every climate; while the impregnable ſtrength of their capital continued for ages to defy the hoſtile attempts of the Barbarians.

The form of government was a pure and ſimple monarchy; the name of the ROMAN REPUBLIC, which ſo long preſerved a faint tradition of freedom, was confined to the Latin provinces; and the princes of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople meaſured their greatneſs by the ſervile obedience of their people.

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weakeſt of the predeceſſors of Arcadius, the reign of the eunuchs had been ſecret, and almoſt inviſible.

The diſregard of cuſtom and decency always betrays a weak and ill-regulated mind; nor does Eutropius ſeem to have compenſated for the folly of the deſign, by any ſuperior merit or ability in the execution.

His three ſervices, which Claudian more particularly deſcribes, were theſe: 1. He ſpent many years as the catamite of Ptolemy, a groom or ſoldier of the Imperial ſtables. 2. Ptolemy gave him to the old general Arintheus, for whom he very ſkilfully exerciſed the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a pimp. 3.

As long as he deſpoiled the oppreſſors, who had enriched themſelves with the plunder of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Eutropius might gratify his covetous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition without much envy or injuſtice: but the progreſs of his rapine ſoon invaded the wealth which had been acquired by lawful inheritance, or laudable induſtry. The uſual methods of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion were practiſed and improved; and Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian has ſketched a lively and original picture of the public auction of the ſtate. <q>"The impotence of the eunuch" (ſays that agreeable ſatiriſt) "has ſerved only to ſtimulate his avarice: the ſame hand which, in his ſervile condition, was exerciſed in petty thefts, to unlock the coffers of his maſter, now graſps the riches of the world; and this infamous broker of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire appreciates and divides the Roman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, from Mount Haemus to the Tigris.

crime of introducing that abject ſlave to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Conſtantinople: and ſome degree of praiſe muſt be allowed to a powerful and ungrateful favourite, who was ſatisfied with the diſgrace of his benefactor. Abundantius was ſtripped of his ample fortunes by an Imperial reſcript, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to Pityus, on the Euxine, the laſt frontier of the Roman world; where he ſubſiſted by the precarious mercy of the Barbarians, till he could obtain, after the fall of Eutropius, a milder exile at Sidon in Phoenicia. The deſtruction of Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius <note n="13" place="bottom">Suidas (moſt probably from the hiſtory of Eunapius) has given a very unfavourable picture of Timaſius. The account of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, the judges, trial, &amp;c. is perfectly agreeable to the practice of ancient and modern courts. (See Zoſimus, l. v. p. 298, 299, 300.) I am almoſt tempted to quote the romance of a great maſter (Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's Works, vol. iv. p. 49, &amp;c. 8vo edit.), which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the hiſtory of human nature.</note>

That great officer, the maſter-general of the armies of Theodoſius, had ſignaliſed his valour by a deciſive victory, which he obtained over the Goths of Theſſaly; but he was too prone, after the example of his ſovereign, to enjoy the luxury of peace, and to abandon his confidence to wicked and deſigning flatterers. Timaſius had deſpiſed the public clamour, by promoting an infamous dependent to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a cohort; and he deſerved to feel the ingratitude of Bargus, who was ſecretly inſtigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the favourite to accuſe his patron of a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conſpiracy. The general was arraigned before the tribunal of Arcadius himſelf; and the principal eunuch ſtood by the ſide of the throne,

to ſuggeſt the queſtions and anſwers of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. But as this form of trial might be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed partial and arbitrary, the farther enquiry into the crimes of Timaſius was delegated to Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus and Procopius; the former of conſular rank, the latter ſtill reſpected as the father-in-law of the emperor Valens. The appearances of a fair and legal proceeding were maintained by the blunt honeſty of Procopius; and he yielded with reluctance to the obſequious dexterity of his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league, who pronounced a ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the unfortunate Timaſius. His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe riches were confiſcated, in the name of the emperor, and for the benefit of the favourite; and he was doomed to perpetual exile at Oaſis, a ſolitary ſpot in the midſt of the ſandy deſerts of Libya <note n="14" place="bottom">The great Oaſis was one of the ſpots in the ſands of Libya, watered with ſprings, and capable of producing wheat, barley, and palm-trees.

Secluded from all human converſe, the maſter-general of the Roman armies was loſt for ever to the world; but the circumſtances of his fate have been related in a various and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory manner.

II. This extreme ſeverity might perhaps be juſtified, had it been only directed to ſecure the repreſentatives of the ſovereign from any actual violence in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their office. But the whole body of Imperial dependents claimed a privilege, or rather impunity, which ſcreened them, in the looſeſt moments of their lives, from the haſty, perhaps the juſtifiable, reſentment of their fellow-citizens: and, by a ſtrange perverſion of the laws, the ſame degree of guilt and puniſhment was applied to a private quarrel, and to a deliberate conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt the emperor and the empire. The edict of Arcadius moſt poſitively and moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly declares, that in ſuch caſes of treaſon, <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> ought to be puniſhed with equal ſeverity; that the knowledge of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous intention, unleſs it be inſtantly revealed,

yet they gradually alarmed both the court and the capital. Every misfortune was exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated in dark and doubtful hints; and the future deſigns of the rebels became the ſubject of anxious conjecture. Whenever Tribigild advanced into the inland country, the Romans were inclined to ſuppoſe that he meditated the paſſage of Mount Taurus, and the invaſion of Syria. If he deſcended towards the ſea, they imputed, and perhaps ſuggeſted, to the Gothic chief, the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in the harbours of Ionia, and of extending his depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations along the maritime coaſt, from the mouth of the Nile to the port of Conſtantinople. The approach of danger, and the obſtinacy of Tribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gild, who refuſed all terms of accommodation, compelled Eutropius to ſummon a council of war <note n="25" place="bottom">The council of Eutropius, in Claudian, may be compared to that of Domitian in the fourth ſatire of Juvenal.

The raſhneſs of the Oſtrogoths had drawn them into a diſadvantageous poſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the rivers Melas and Eurymedon, where they were almoſt beſieged by the peaſants of Pamphylia; but the arrival of an Imperial army, inſtead of completing their deſtruction, afforded the means of ſafety and victory. Tribigild ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed the unguarded camp of the Romans, in the darkneſs of the night; ſeduced the faith of the greater part of the Barbarian auxiliaries, and diſſipated, without much effort, the troops, which had been corrupted by the relaxation of diſcipline, and the luxury of the capital. The diſcontent of Gainas, who had ſo boldly contrived and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the death of Rufinus, was irritated by the fortune of his unworthy ſucceſſor; he accuſed his own diſhonourable patience under the ſervile reign of an eunuch; and the ambitious Goth was convicted, at leaſt in the public opinion, of ſecretly fomenting the revolt of Tribigild, with whom he was connected by a domeſtic, as well as by a national, alliance <note n="27" place="bottom">The <hi>conſpiracy</hi> of Gainas and Tribigild, which is atteſted by the Greek hiſtorian, had not reached the ears of Claudian, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the revolt of the Oſtrogoths to his own <hi>martial</hi> ſpirit, and the advice of his wife.</note>.

Two paſſions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, fear and conjugal affection, awakened the languid ſoul of Arcadius: he was terrified by the threats of a victorious Barbarian; and he yielded to the tender eloquence of his wife Eudoxia, who, with a flood of artificial tears, preſenting her infant children to their father, implored his juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for ſome real or imaginary inſult, which ſhe imputed to the audacious eunuch <note n="28" place="bottom">This anecdote, which Philoſtorgius alone has preſerved (l. xi. c. 6. and Gothofred.

In this hour of diſtreſs and deſpair, his only refuge was in the ſanctuary of the church, whoſe privileges he had wiſely, or profanely, attempted to circumſcribe; and the moſt eloquent of the ſaints, John Chryſoſtom, enjoyed the triumph of protecting a proſtrate miniſter, whoſe choice had raiſed him to the eccleſiaſtical throne of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.

His infirmities compelled him to return to the ſociety of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and the authority of Meletius devoted his talents to the ſervice of the church: but in the midſt of his family, and afterwards on the archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal throne, Chryſoſtom ſtill perſevered in the practice of the monaſtic virtues. The ample revenues, which his predeceſſors had conſumed in pomp and luxury, he deligently applied to the eſtabliſhment of hoſpitals; and the multitudes, who were ſupported by his charity, preferred the eloquent and edifying diſcourſes of their arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, to the amuſements of the theatre, or the circus.

When Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom thundred, from the pulpit of St. Sophia, againſt the degeneracy of the Chriſtians, his ſhafts were ſpent among the crowd, without wounding, or even marking, the character of any individual.

The Boſphorus was covered with innumerable veſſels; the ſhores of Europe and Aſia were profuſely illuminated; and the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of a victorious people accompanied, from the port to the cathedral, the triumph of the archbiſhop; who, too eaſily, conſented to reſume the exerciſe of his functions, before his ſentence had been legally reverſed by the authority of an eccleſiaſtical ſynod.

the Perſian monarch. Inſtead of tempting the allegiance of an ambitious ſubject, by the participation of ſupreme power, he boldly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the magnanimity of a king; and placed, by a ſolemn teſtament, the ſceptre of the Eaſt in the hands of Jezdegerd himſelf. The royal guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian accepted and diſcharged this honourable truſt with unexampled fidelity; and the infancy of Theodoſius was protected by the arms and councils of Perſia. Such is the ſingular narrative of Procopius; and his veracity is not diſputed by Agathias <note n="64" place="bottom">Agathias, l. iv. p. 136, 137. Although he confeſſes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of the tradition, he aſſerts, that Procopius was the firſt who had committed it to writing. Tillemont (Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 597.) argues very ſenſibly on the merits of this fable. His criticiſm was not warped by any eccleſiaſtical authority: both Procopius and Agathias are half Pagans.</note>, while he preſumes to diſſent from his judgment, and to arraign the wiſdom of a Chriſtian emperor, who, ſo raſhly, though ſo fortunately, committed his ſon and his dominions to the unknown faith of a ſtranger, a rival, and a heathen. At the diſtance of one hundred and fifty years, this political queſtion might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in the court of Juſtinian; but a prudent hiſtorian will refuſe to examine the <hi>propriety,</hi> till he has aſcertained the <hi>truth,</hi> of the teſtament of Arcadius. As it ſtands without a parallel in the hiſtory of the world, we may juſtly require, that it ſhould be atteſted by the poſitive and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous evidence of contemporaries.

            <p>The maxims of Roman juriſprudence, if they <note place="margin">Adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, A. D. 408—415.</note> could fairly be transferred from private property to public dominion, would have adjudged to the emperor Honorius the guardianſhip of his nephew, till he had attained, at leaſt, the fourteenth year of his age. But the weakneſs of Honorius, and the calamities of his reign, diſqualified him from proſecuting this natural claim; and ſuch was the abſolute ſeparation of the two monarchies, both in intereſt and affection, that Conſtantinople would have obeyed, with leſs reluctance, the orders of the Perſian, than thoſe of the Italian, court. Under a prince, whoſe weakneſs is diſguiſed by the external ſigns of manhood and diſcretion, the moſt worthleſs favourites may ſecretly diſpute the empire of the palace; and dictate to ſubmiſſive provinces, the commands of a maſter, whom they direct and deſpiſe. But the miniſters of a child, who is incapable of arming them with the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the royal name, muſt acquire and exerciſe an independent authority. The great officers of the ſtate and army, who had been appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the death of Arcadius, formed an ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, which might have inſpired them with the idea of a free republic; and the government of the eaſtern empire was fortunately aſſumed by the praefect Anthemius <note n="65" place="bottom">Socrates, l. vii. c. 1. Anthemius was the grandſon of Philip, one of the miniſters of Conſtantius, and the grandfather of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Anthemius. After his return from the Perſian embaſſy, he was appointed conſul and Praetorian praefect of the Eaſt, in the year 405; and held the praefecture about ten years.

The ſafety of the young emperor proved the merit and integrity of Anthemius; and his prudent firmneſs ſuſtained the force and reputation of an infant reign. Uldin, with a formidable hoſt of Barbarians, was encamped in the heart of Thrace: he proudly rejected all terms of accommodation; and, pointing to the riſing ſun, declared to the Roman ambaſſadors, that the courſe of that planet ſhould alone terminate the conqueſts of the Huns. But the deſertion of his confederates, who were privately convinced of the juſtice and liberality of the Imperial mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, obliged Uldin to repaſs the Danube: the tribe of the Scyrri, which compoſed his rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, was almoſt extirpated; and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand captives were diſperſed, to cultivate, with ſervile labour, the fields of Aſia <note n="66" place="bottom">Sozomen, l. ix. c. 5.

His ſiſter Pulcheria <note n="68" place="bottom">Sozomen has filled three chapters with a magnificent panegyric of Pulcheria (l. ix. c. 1, 2, 3.); and Tillemont (Memoires Eccleſ. tom. xv. p. 171—184.) has dedicated a ſeparate article to the honour of St. Pulcheria, virgin, and empreſs.</note>, who was only two years older than himſelf, received, at the age of ſixteen, the title of <hi>Auguſta;</hi> and though her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour might be ſometimes clouded by caprice or intrigue, ſhe continued to govern the Eaſtern empire near forty years; during the long mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her brother, and after his death, in her own name, and in the name of Marcian, her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal huſband.

was inſcribed on a tablet of gold and gems; which they publicly offered in the great church of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople. Their palace was converted into a monaſtery; and all males, except the guides of their conſcience, the ſaints who had forgotten the diſtinction of ſexes, were ſcrupulouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the holy threſhold. Pulcheria, her two ſiſters, and a choſen train of favourite dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, formed a religious community: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the vanity of dreſs; interrupted, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent faſts, their ſimple and frugal diet; allotted a portion of their time to works of embroidery; and devoted ſeveral hours of the day and night to the exerciſes of prayer and pſalmody. The piety of a Chriſtian virgin was adorned by the zeal and liberality of an empreſs. Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory deſcribes the ſplendid churches, which were built at the expence of Pulcheria, in all the provinces of the Eaſt; her charitable foundations for the benefit of ſtrangers and the poor; the ample donations which ſhe aſſigned for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual maintenance of monaſtic ſocieties; and the active ſeverity with which ſhe laboured to ſuppreſs the oppoſite hereſies of Neſtorius and Eutyches. Such virtues were ſuppoſed to deſerve the peculiar favour of the Deity; and the relics of martyrs, as well as the knowledge of future events, were communicated in viſions and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to the Imperial ſaint <note n="71" place="bottom">She was admoniſhed, by repeated dreams, of the place where the relics of the forty martyrs had been buried. The ground had ſucceſſively belonged to the houſe and garden of a woman of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, to a monaſtery of Macedonian monks, and to a church of St. Thyrſus, erected by Caeſarius, who was conſul A. D. 397; and the memory of the relics was almoſt obliterated. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charitable wiſhes of Dr. Jortin (Remarks, tom. iv. p. 234.), it is not eaſy to acquit Pulcheria of ſome ſhare in the pious fraud; which muſt have been tranſacted, when ſhe was more than five-and-thirty years of age.</note>. Yet the devotion
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0034700105:426"/>
of Pulcheria never diverted her indefatigable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from temporal affairs; and ſhe alone, among all the deſcendants of the great Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, appears to have inherited any ſhare of his manly ſpirit and abilities. The elegant and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar uſe which ſhe had acquired, both of the Greek and Latin languages, was readily applied to the various occaſions of ſpeaking, or writing, on public buſineſs: her deliberations were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely weighed; her actions were prompt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive; and, while ſhe moved without noiſe or oſtentation the wheel of government, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly attributed to the genius of the emperor, the long tranquillity of his reign. In the laſt years of his peaceful life, Europe was indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the arms of Attila; but the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive provinces of Aſia ſtill continued to enjoy a profound and permanent repoſe. Theodoſius the younger was never reduced to the diſgraceful neceſſity of encountering and puniſhing a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſubject: and ſince we cannot applaud the vigour, ſome praiſe may be due to the mildneſs, and proſperity, of the adminiſtration of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheria.</p>
            <p>The Roman world was deeply intereſted in the <note place="margin">Education and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius the younger.</note> education of its maſter. A regular courſe of ſtudy and exerciſe was judiciouſly inſtituted; of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0034700105:427"/>
the military exerciſes of riding, and ſhooting with the bow; of the liberal ſtudies of grammar, rhetoric, and philoſophy: the moſt ſkilful maſters of the Eaſt ambitiouſly ſolicited the attention of their royal pupil; and ſeveral noble youths were introduced into the palace, to animate his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by the emulation of friendſhip. Pulcheria alone diſcharged the important taſk of inſtructing her brother in the arts of government; but her precepts may countenance ſome ſuſpicion of the extent of her capacity, or of the purity of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. She taught him to maintain a grave and majeſtic deportment; to walk, to hold his robes, to ſeat himſelf on his throne, in a manner worthy of a great prince; to abſtain from laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; to liſten with condeſcenſion; to return ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able anſwers; to aſſume, by turns, a ſerious or a placid countenance; in a word, to repreſent with grace and dignity the external figure of a Roman emperor. But Theodoſius <note n="72" place="bottom">There is a remarkable difference between the two eccleſiaſtical hiſtorians, who in general bear ſo cloſe a reſemblance. Sozomen (l. ix. c. 1.) aſcribes to Pulcheria the government of the empire, and the education of her brother; whom he ſcarcely condeſcends to praiſe. Socrates, though he affectedly diſclaims all hopes of ſavour or fame, compoſes an elaborate panegyric on the emperor, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly ſuppreſſes the merits of his ſiſter (l. vii. c. 22. 42.).

<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0034700105:428"/>
preſume to meaſure the degrees of incapacity) below the weakneſs of his father and his uncle. Arcadius and Honorius had been aſſiſted by the guardian care of a parent, whoſe leſſons were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by his authority, and example. But the unfortunate prince, who is born in the purple, muſt remain a ſtranger to the voice of truth; and the ſon of Arcadius was condemned to paſs his perpetual infancy, encompaſſed only by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile train of women and eunuchs. The ample leiſure, which he acquired by neglecting the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential duties of his high office, was filled by idle amuſements, and unprofitable ſtudies. Hunting was the only active purſuit that could tempt him beyond the limits of the palace; but he moſt aſſiduouſly laboured, ſometimes by the light of a midnight lamp, in the mechanic occupations of painting and carving; and the elegance with which he tranſcribed religious books, entitled the Roman emperor to the ſingular epithet of <hi>Calligraphes,</hi> or a fair writer. Separated from the world by an impenetrable veil, Theodoſius truſted the perſons whom he loved; he loved thoſe who were accuſtomed to amuſe and flatter his indolence; and as he never peruſed the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that were preſented for the royal ſignature, the acts of injuſtice the moſt repugnant to his character, were frequently perpetrated in his name. The emperor himſelf was chaſte, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, liberal, and merciful; but theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which can only deſerve the name of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, when they are ſupported by courage, and
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0034700105:429"/>
regulated by diſcretion, were ſeldom beneficial, and they ſometimes proved miſchievous, to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. His mind, enervated by a royal educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was oppreſſed, and degraded, by abject ſuperſtition: he faſted, he ſung pſalms, he blindly accepted the miracles and doctrines, with which his faith was continually nouriſhed. Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius devoutly worſhipped the dead and living ſaints of the Catholic church; and he once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to eat, till an inſolent monk, who had caſt an excommunication on his ſovereign, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to heal the ſpiritual wound which he had inflicted <note n="73" place="bottom">Theodoret, l. v. c. 37.

The celebrated Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais <note n="74" place="bottom">Socrates (l. vii. c. 21.) mentions her name (Athenais, the daughter of Leontius, an Athenian ſophiſt), her baptiſm, marriage, and poetical genius. The moſt ancient account of her hiſtory is in John Malala (part ii. p. 20, 21. edit. Venet. 1743), and in the Paſchal Chronicle (p. 311, 312.). Thoſe authors had probably ſeen original pictures of the empreſs Eudocia. The modern Greeks, Zonaras, Cedrenus, &amp;c. have diſplayed the love, rather than the talent, of fiction. From Nicephorus, indeed, I have ventured to aſſume her age. The writer of a romance would not have <hi>imagined,</hi> that Athenais was near twenty-eight years old when ſhe inflamed the heart of a young emperor.</note> was educated by her father Leontius in the religion and ſciences of the Greeks; and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous was the opinion which the Athenian philoſopher entertained of his contemporaries,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:0034700105:430"/>
that he divided his patrimony between his two ſons, bequeathing to his daughter a ſmall legacy of one hundred pieces of gold, in the lively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that her beauty and merit would be a ſufficient portion. The jealouſy and avarice of her brothers ſoon compelled Athenais to ſeek a refuge at Conſtantinople; and, with ſome hopes, either of juſtice, or favour, to throw herſelf at the feet of Pulcheria. That ſagacious princeſs liſtened to her eloquent complaint; and ſecretly deſtined the daughter of the philoſopher Leontius for the future wife of the emperor of the Eaſt, who had now attained the twentieth year of his age. She eaſily excited the curioſity of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by an intereſting picture of the charms of Athenais; large eyes, a well-proportioned noſe, a fair complexion, golden locks, a ſlender perſon, a graceful demeanour, an underſtanding improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſtudy, and a virtue tried by diſtreſs, Theodoſius, concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his ſiſter, was permitted to behold the Athenian virgin: the modeſt youth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately declared his pure and honourable love; and the royal nuptials were celebrated amidſt the acclamations of the capital and the provinces. Athenais, who was eaſily perſuaded to renounce the errors of Paganiſm, received at her baptiſm the Chriſtian name of Eudocia; but the cautious Pulcheria withheld the title of Auguſta, till the wife of Theodoſius had approved her fruitfulneſs by the birth of a daughter, who eſpouſed, fifteen years afterwards, the emperor of the Weſt. The
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0034700105:431"/>
brothers of Eudocia obeyed, with ſome anxiety, her Imperial ſummons; but, as ſhe could eaſily forgive their fortunate unkindneſs, ſhe indulged the tenderneſs, or perhaps the vanity, of a ſiſter, by promoting them to the rank of conſuls and praefects. In the luxury of the palace, ſhe ſtill cultivated thoſe ingenious arts, which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to her greatneſs; and wiſely dedicated her talents to the honour of religion, and of her huſband. Eudocia compoſed a poeticall para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe of the firſt eight books of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the prophecies of Daniel and Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah; a cento of the verſes of Homer, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the life and miracles of Chriſt, the legend of St. Cyprian, and a panegyric on the Perſian victories of Theodoſius: and her writings, which were applauded by a ſervile and ſuperſtitious age, have not been diſdained by the candour of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial criticiſm <note n="75" place="bottom">Socrates, l. vii. c. 21. Photius, p. 413—420. The Homeric cento is ſtill extant, and has been repeatedly printed; but the claim of Eudocia to that inſipid performance is diſputed by the critics. See Fabricius, Biblioth. Graec. tom. i. p. 357. The <hi>Ionia,</hi> a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaneous dictionary of hiſtory and fable, was compiled by another empreſs of the name of Eudocia, who lived in the eleventh century; and the work is ſtill extant in manuſcript.</note>. The fondneſs of the emperor was not abated by time and poſſeſſion; and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia, after the marriage of her daughter, was permitted to diſcharge her grateful vows by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn pilgrimage to Jeruſalem. Her oſtentatious progreſs through the Eaſt may ſeem inconſiſtent with the ſpirit of Chriſtian humility: ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, from a throne of gold and gems, an
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0034700105:432"/>
eloquent oration to the ſenate of Antioch, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her royal intention of enlarging the walls of the city, beſtowed a donative of two hundred pounds of gold to reſtore the public baths, and accepted the ſtatues, which were decreed by the gratitude of Antioch. In the Holy Land, her alms and pious foundations exceeded the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the great Helena; and though the public treaſure might be impoveriſhed by this exceſſive liberality, ſhe enjoyed the conſcious ſatisfaction of returning to Conſtantinople with the chains of St. Peter, the right arm of St. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, and an undoubted picture of the Virgin, painted by St. Luke <note n="76" place="bottom">Baronius (Annal. Eccleſ. A. D. 438, 439.) is copious and florid; but he is accuſed of placing the lies of different ages on the ſame level of authenticity.</note>. But this pilgrimage was the fatal term of the glories of Eudocia. Satiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with empty pomp, and unmindful, perhaps, of her obligations to Pulcheria, ſhe ambitiouſly aſpired to the government of the Eaſtern empire: the palace was diſtracted by female diſcord; but the victory was at laſt decided, by the ſuperior aſcendant of the ſiſter of Theodoſius. The exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Paulinus, maſter of the offices, and the diſgrace of Cyrus, Praetorian praefect of the Eaſt, convinced the public, that the favour of Eudocia was inſufficient to protect her moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friends; and the uncommon beauty of Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus encouraged the ſecret rumour, that his guilt was that of a ſucceſsful lover <note n="77" place="bottom">In this ſhort view of the diſgrace of Eudocia, I have imitated the caution of Evagrius (l. i. c. 21.), and count Marcellinus (in Chron.

The two authentic dates aſſigned by the latter, overturn a great part of the Greek fictions; and the celebrated ſtory of the <hi>apple,</hi> &amp;c. is fit only for the Arabian Nights, where ſomething not very unlike it may be found.</note>. As ſoon as the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0034700105:433"/>
empreſs perceived that the affection of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius was irretrievably loſt, ſhe requeſted the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of retiring to the diſtant ſolitude of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. She obtained her requeſt; but the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of Theodoſius, or the vindictive ſpirit of Pulcheria, purſued her in her laſt retreat; and Saturninus, count of the domeſtics, was directed to puniſh with death two eccleſiaſtics, her moſt favoured ſervants. Eudocia inſtantly revenged them by the aſſaſſination of the count: the furious paſſions, which ſhe indulged on this ſuſpicious occaſion, ſeemed to juſtify the ſeverity of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius; and the empreſs, ignominiouſly ſtript of the honours of her rank <note n="78" place="bottom">Priſcus (in Excerpt.

The remainder of the life of Eudocia, about ſixteen years, was ſpent in exile and devotion; and the approach of age, the death of Theodoſius, the misfortunes of her only daughter, who was led a captive from Rome to Carthage, and the ſociety of the Holy Monks of Paleſtine, inſenſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the religious temper of her mind. After a full experience of the viciſſitudes of human life, the daughter of the philoſopher Leontius expired, at Jeruſalem, in the ſixty-ſeventh year of her age; proteſting with her dying breath,

The Paſchal Chronicle may ſometimes deſerve regard; and, in the domeſtic hiſtory of Antioch, John Malala becomes a writer of good authority. The Abbé Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>née, in a memoir on the fertility of Paleſtine, of which I have only ſeen an extract, calculates the gifts of Eudocia at 20,488 pounds of gold, above 800,000 pounds Sterling.</note>.</p>

Tillemont, Mem. Eccleſ. tom. xii. p. 356—364. Aſſemanni, bibliot. Oriental. tom. iii. p. 396. tom. iv. p. 61. Theodoret blames the raſhneſs of Abdas, but extols the conſtancy of his martyrdom. Yet I do not clearly underſtand the caſuiſtry which prohibits our repairing the damage which we have unlawfully committed.</note>. His zeal and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy were revenged on his brethren: the Magi excited a cruel perſecution; and the intolerant zeal of Jezdegerd was imitated by his ſon Vara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranes, or Bahram, who ſoon afterwards aſcended the throne. Some Chriſtian fugitives, who eſcaped to the Roman frontier, were ſternly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and generouſly refuſed; and the refuſal, aggravated by commercial diſputes, ſoon kindled a war between the rival monarchies. The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Armenia, and the plains of Meſopotamia,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:0034700105:435"/>
were filled with hoſtile armies; but the operations of two ſucceſſive campaigns were not productive of any deciſive or memorable events. Some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements were fought, ſome towns were beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with various and doubtful ſucceſs; and if the Romans failed in their attempt to recover the long loſt poſſeſſion of Niſibis, the Perſians were repulſed from the walls of a Meſopotamian city, by the valour of a martial biſhop, who pointed his thundering engine in the name of St. Thomas the Apoſtle. Yet the ſplendid victories, which the incredible ſpeed of the meſſenger Palladius repeatedly announced to the palace of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, were celebrated with feſtivals and pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrics. From theſe panegyrics the <note n="81" place="bottom">Socrates (l. vii. c. 18, 19, 20, 21.) is the beſt author for the Perſian war. We may likewiſe conſult the three Chronicles, the Paſchal, and thoſe of Marcellinus and Malala.</note> hiſtorians of the age might borrow their extraordinary, and, perhaps, fabulous, tales; of the proud challenge of a Perſian hero, who was entangled by the net, and diſpatched by the ſword, of Areobindus the Goth; of the ten thouſand <hi>Immortals,</hi> who were ſlain in the attack of the Roman camp; and of the hundred thouſand Arabs, or Saracens, who were impelled by a panic terror to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves headlong into the Euphrates. Such events may be diſbelieved, or diſregarded; but the charity of a biſhop, Acacius of Amida, whoſe name might have dignified the ſaintly calendar, ſhall not be loſt in oblivion. Boldly declaring, that vaſes of gold and ſilver are uſeleſs to a God
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0034700105:436"/>
who neither eats nor drinks, the generous prelate ſold the plate of the church of Amida; employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the price in the redemption of ſeven thouſand Perſian captives; ſupplied their wants with affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate liberality; and diſmiſſed them to their native country, to inform the king of the true ſpirit of the religion which he perſecuted. The practice of benevolence in the midſt of war muſt always tend to aſſuage the animoſity of contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nations; and I wiſh to perſuade myſelf, that Acacius contributed to the reſtoration of peace. In the conference which was held on the limits of the two empires, the Roman ambaſſadors degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the perſonal character of their ſovereign, by a vain attempt to magnify the extent of his power; when they ſeriouſly adviſed the Perſians to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, by a timely accommodation, the wrath of a monarch, who was yet ignorant of this diſtant war. A truce of one hundred years was ſolemnly ratified; and, although the revolutions of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia might threaten the public tranquillity, the eſſential conditions of this treaty were reſpected near fourſcore years by the ſucceſſors of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and Artaxerxes.</p>
            <p>Since the Roman and Parthian ſtandards firſt <note place="margin">Armenia divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Perſians and the Romans,</note> encountered on the banks of the Euphrates, the kingdom of Armenia <note n="82" place="bottom">This account of the ruin and diviſion of the kingdom of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia is taken from the third book of the Armenian hiſtory of Moſes of Chorene. Deficient as he is in every qualification of a good hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, his local information, his paſſions, and his prejudices, are ſtrongly expreſſive of a native and contemporary. Procopius (de Edificiis, l. iii. c. 1. 5.) relates the ſame facts in a very different manner; but I have extracted the circumſtances the moſt probable in themſelves, and the leaſt inconſiſtent with Moſes of Chorene.</note> was alternately oppreſſed

D. 431—440.</note> A diſgraceful treaty had reſigned Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia to the ambition of Sapor; and the ſcale of Perſia appeared to preponderate. But the royal race of Arſaces impatiently ſubmitted to the houſe of Saſſan; the turbulent nobles aſſerted, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, their hereditary independence; and the nation was ſtill attached to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> princes of Conſtantinople. In the beginning of the fifth century, Armenia was divided by the progreſs of war and faction <note n="83" place="bottom">The weſtern Armenians uſed the Greek language and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their religious offices; but the uſe of that hoſtile tongue was prohibited by the Perſians in the eaſtern provinces, which were obliged to uſe the Syriac, till the invention of the Armenian letters by Meſrobes, in the beginning of the fifth century, and the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent verſion of the Bible into the Armenian language; an event which relaxed the connection of the church and nation with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</note>; and the unnatural diviſion precipitated the downfal of that ancient monarchy. Choſroes, the Perſian vaſſal, reigned over the Eaſtern and moſt extenſive portion of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; while the Weſtern province acknowledged the juriſdiction of Arſaces, and the ſupremacy of the emperor Arcadius. After the death of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaces, the Romans ſuppreſſed the regal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and impoſed on their allies the condition of ſubjects. The military command was dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the count of the Armenian frontier; the city of Theodoſiopolis <note n="84" place="bottom">Moſes Choren. l. iii. c. 59. p. 309. and p. 358.

a ſtrong ſituation, on a fertile and lofty ground, near the ſources of the Euphrates; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent territories were ruled by five ſatraps, whoſe dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple. The leſs fortunate nobles, who lamented the loſs of their king, and envied the honours of their equals, were provoked to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate their peace and pardon at the Perſian court; and returning, with their followers, to the palace of Artaxata, acknowledged Choſroes for their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſovereign. About thirty years afterwards, Artaſires, the nephew and ſucceſſor of Choſroes, fell under the diſpleaſure of the haughty and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious nobles of Armenia; and they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly deſired a Perſian governor in the room of an unworthy king. The anſwer of the archbiſhop Iſaac, whoſe ſanction they earneſtly ſolicited, is expreſſive of the character of a ſuperſtitious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He deplored the manifeſt and inexcuſable vices of Artaſires; and declared, that he ſhould not heſitate to accuſe him before the tribunal of a Chriſtian emperor, who would puniſh, without deſtroying, the ſinner. "Our king," continued Iſaac, <q>"is too much addicted to licentious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but he has been purified in the holy waters of baptiſm. He is a lover of women, but he does not adore the fire or the elements. He may deſerve the reproach of lewdneſs, but he is an undoubted Catholic; and his faith is pure, though his manners are flagitious.
