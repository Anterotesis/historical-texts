            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very Perſon is ſenſible, how fatal the Diſeaſe I inſiſt on, hath been theſe late Years; and perhaps there is not a Family in the Kingdom, that laments not the Spoils of it; which is ſufficient to juſtify every honeſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to free the Publick from ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0205300800:4"/>
            <p>I ſhall not enter into the Diſpute about Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, which is now on the Carpet; by reaſon what I have in my Views, is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeding any Occaſion for that Operation; which, if it could be obtain'd, muſt, on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Accounts, be preferr'd to the general Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it; and render it more ſafe in the few Inſtances, wherein, after all, it may be eſteem'd proper.</p>
            <p>In order to introduce this Propoſal, I think it neceſſary to obſerve what gave me the firſt Hint, and is the real Foundation of it; <hi>viz. That the Diſtemper it ſelf is both of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Extract, and of a late Origin.</hi> There are ſome Parts of the World entirely unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it at this Day; and we are aſſur'd, one Quarter of it (viz. <hi>America</hi>) was ſo, till the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſubdued it; when, by the Infection of a Negro, this cruel Diſeaſe ſpread it ſelf among the Natives, and hath now almoſt extirpated great and populous Clans.</p>
            <p>The old <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Phyſicians had no Idea of this Diſorder; For we have the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0205300800:5"/>firſt Deſcriptions of it from the <hi>Arabian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I confeſs, we read of Eruptions in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and have Reaſon to think theſe obtain'd in ancient Time. I know not whether what we term the <hi>Chicken-Pox,</hi> may not be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per critical Secretion of ſome Humours in Children; for they often affect them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous Contagion, and are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no ill Conſequence. But the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> (who, every Perſon knows, by their ſordid, naſty way of Living, in a hot Climate, have turn'd common Fevers into Plagues;) have perhaps, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, given that malignant, contagious Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, to thoſe Mild and Natural Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtules.</p>
            <p>From this Account of the Caſe, it muſt evidently follow, that the Diſtemper I now treat of, <hi>is One Species of a Plague;</hi> and therefore both <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>ought,</hi> in the ſame Manner, to be extirpated from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The late Experiments of Inoculating it, confirm this Account; and, at the ſame Time, ſufficiently demonſtrate, how ſmall a Seed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0205300800:6"/>leſs than the Hundredth Part of a Grain, will produce a very plentiful Crop. It's true, this may differ very much, in regard of the Soil; which is a Conſideration, in Favour of a Practice, that allows us a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Opportunity to prepare the Body, and to adjuſt both the Quantity and Situation of the Particles, that are thrown into it. But why ſhou'd we <hi>generally</hi> cultivate after this manner an <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Plant, that hath made ſuch dreadful Havock among us? Eſpecially ſince there is ſo much Reaſon to queſtion, whether we could promiſe our ſelves that Succeſs, if it were <hi>univerſally</hi> in Uſe: For, the Contagion muſt increaſe in Proportion to the Subjects; whereas, on the other hand, when the Diſeaſe hath left us, the few who (on the Account of Travelling, or Phyſick) may have leave to go through the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will run leſs Hazard in it.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, there will be a Difficulty in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming popular Prejudices, in Favour of theſe Diſorders. They eſteem them ſent of God, for the Sins of Mankind; which is a pious Account of all our Afflictions. But when this Repreſentation diſcourages the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0205300800:7"/>Endeavours to remove them; it hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally been eſteem'd, in other Caſes, a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Abuſe of the Doctrine. This is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the Caſe in <hi>Turkey;</hi> where, for that Reaſon, their great Towns are no more free from the Plague, than ours are from the <hi>Small-Pox.</hi> But I have the Pleaſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that <hi>the Articles of the Church of England</hi> prudently caution us againſt this Conſtruction of the Sentence of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; <hi>which, for Curious and Carnal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to have before their Eyes,</hi> is there ſaid to be, <hi>a great Downfall.</hi> But I leave the Management of this Argument to our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
            <p>When our People are well reconcil'd to the Religion of the Thing, there can, perhaps, be nothing more eaſy or ſafe, than to deliver us from the Infection. For, the Subſtance of my Propoſal is but, in ſhort,
<q>To take the Method, that was inſiſted on as neceſſary to deliver us from the Plague, if it had been imported among us; <hi>as we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it might, from</hi> Marſeilles.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0205300800:8"/>
            <p>The Thing is then ſo far done, that I have Reaſon to hope, and ſay, A few Generations hence would enquire, what Sort of Diſtemper their Anceſtors intended, by the Name of the <hi>Small-Pox?</hi> And when ſo great an Advantage may be procur'd by it; there can be nothing unkind, or difficult, only <hi>in obliging the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants and Phyſicians, where the</hi> Small-Pox <hi>are, to perform a Sort of</hi> Quarantain; <hi>to bury the Furniture, and purify the Houſes;</hi> which is all that will be requir'd, and to which they will have ſufficient Inducement to conſent, if the Loſs they ſuſtain by it, is but ſupported by the Publick. I know not whether an <hi>Office of Inſurance</hi> might not be eſtabliſh'd for that Purpoſe: But this will be the Care of the Legiſlature, if our Phyſicians do but come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scheme: They are the only Perſons that will ſuffer, in a profitable Branch of their Practice. But whatever ſome impudent Quacks may have in their View, I have the Aſſurance to ſay, The Gentlemen of the Faculty, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Principles of the New Philoſophy, and the beſt Experience, will eſteem this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal worthy their Conſideration. They know very well, that when the Eruption is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0205300800:9"/>and the putrid Particles have fix'd on the Lungs, and vital Parts, the Event muſt be left to Nature; for there is little Room for the Exerciſe of the beſt Skill: And upon that Account, they muſt be pleas'd with an Expedient, that will ſecure their Art from the Tryals, that are vain in themſelves, and often fatal to their Reputation. As for the Scandal of our Profeſſion, the Men who have no Comfort but in Filth and Ordure, and are only Caterers for the Worms; I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to confeſs, I have ſhew'd no regard to their mercenary Ends.</p>
            <p>It is to the very Learned and Worthy-Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I ſubmit this Propoſal; who will, I am perſuaded, at leaſt honourably treat a Plan, that is form'd upon the Practice of ſome of the Ancient Phyſicians, the Fathers and firſt Ornaments of this Science; who did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſult particular Caſes, but <hi>deliver'd whole Nations at once from Plagues.</hi> If the Method I have ſuggeſted appears to them as well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for this Purpoſe, as it's honeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd; I have no Reaſon to doubt the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Perſons of ſuch a generous and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0205300800:10"/>Education, and whoſe Buſineſs is the Health of the People.</p>
            <p>I know, the Fate of this Scheme will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on their Repreſentation of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by reaſon <hi>The Royal College of Phyſicians</hi> are beſt qualify'd to direct the Execution, I have not preſum'd to offer the <hi>particular Rules</hi> that muſt be obſerv'd, and that will require the Sanction of the Legiſlature: It is what, I do not doubt, they will favour their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with, if this Propoſal is ſo happy as to come recommended by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Moſt Sacred Majeſty,</hi> whom God long preſerve; and Their <hi>Royal Highneſſes,</hi> tho' they are now in no pain for the <hi>Princes,</hi> the young Hopes and Joys of theſe Realms; They have too much Regard for their People, not to encourage every Thing that may make them Happy and Healthful.</p>
            <p>And I hope our <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> will eſteem it too much a common Intereſt, to neglect this Propoſal, if there is a Proſpect (as, I think, there is a very good one) in this Way of being ſecure from this Diſtemper,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0205300800:11"/>and, at the ſame Time, from a Train of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Ulcers, that generally attend the worſt Sort of it. For why ſhou'd we cheriſh the cruel Brood of <hi>Africa</hi> or <hi>Aſia</hi> in our Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, that have made thoſe frightful Ravages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and entail this Poiſon on our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that was, perhaps, the Import of our Holy Wars in former Days?</p>
            <p>How great muſt be the Happineſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the new Scenes ariſe, when a noiſome Plague ſhall ceaſe to <hi>change our Countenances, and ſend us away, or to make us a Terror to our ſelves and others!</hi> How deſirable would it be, no more (unleſs by the ſpecial Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Heaven) to feel any of the Fury of it, filling our Graves, or ſpoiling our Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? We ſhou'd not then ſo frequently meet the diſmal Scars, and indelible Characters, it hath left on almoſt every Face: But <hi>Britain,</hi> no longer inhabited by theſe Sort of <hi>Picts,</hi> would become <hi>Fair Albion</hi> once again.</p>
            <p>Then, to uſe the ſacred Stile, <hi>may our Sons be as Plants grown up in their Youth;</hi> they will always carry their firſt Bloom; <hi>and our Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as Corner-ſtones, poliſh'd after the ſimilitude
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0205300800:12"/>of a Palace;</hi> or, in our Language, more ſmooth and ſparkling than the beſt-wrought Marble. Then would all the Domeſtick Virtues flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: The Beautiful Mothers, ſecure of the Affection of their Huſbands, wou'd convey the healthy Treaſure to their Offspring: The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies wou'd ſhine in our Aſſemblies; and the Gentlemen ſoften, under their Influence, into every Virtue. Let future Ages tell the reſt with Joy!</p>
            <p>Full of this Project, I can't forbear ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to my ſelf the Acknowledgments of a whole Iſland; and every Perſon in it, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to make my Life eaſy and happy, who have in this Propoſal ſtudied to make theirs ſo.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>WHen I wrote this Scheme, I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible of ſome conſiderable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which a Learned Gentleman, who is a Glory to the Profeſſion, did me the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to make to it: As, <hi>That the Seeds of the</hi> Small-Pox <hi>are almoſt in every Houſe, which hath made it the Diſeaſe of the Country.</hi> But how much ſoever they are naturaliz'd to the Soil, and have diffus'd themſelves in it; I have Reaſon to hope, Care and Induſtry might ſurmount this Difficulty. For, the Particles appear, by their ſlow Operation, not to have that Life and Action, which thoſe have which conſtitute the Plague: If every Houſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in <hi>Great Britain</hi> (that is ſuſpected) would but ſubmit to <hi>ſuch a Purification</hi> as the <hi>Inſpir'd Lawgiver</hi> (I had almoſt ſaid <hi>Phyſician</hi>) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in another Species of a Plague, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0205300800:14"/>xiii. 47, 48, &amp;c. and xiv. 33, &amp;c. we might obſerve the happy Effects of it, not only in deſtroying the Vegetation of the Seeds of this Diſtemper, but of ſome others, which ſubſiſt in Rags and Dirt. In general, it muſt render the Nation more clean and healthful: And why ſhould not a <hi>Divine Law,</hi> as far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <hi>immediately to Health,</hi> lay us under a Moral Obligation now, where there is any Parity in the Caſe, as I apprehend in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? Our Criticks may obſerve with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſicians apply to the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> ſome of the Terms which occur in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Verſion of theſe Chapters. If it is ſaid, The Prieſts were to execute the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Order; it is, becauſe <hi>They</hi> were the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> But it is not my Buſineſs here to conſider the typical Uſe of it.</p>
            <p>I apprehend it will be urged, That after all this Care, when they are extirpated in one Place, they may poſſibly break out in another. It is what may be expected for ſome Time, and will only require a more conſtant Attendance on this Diſtemper through the whole Iſland: In which this Advantage will probably be gain'd; That whenever it does
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0205300800:15"/>ſprout in any Quarter, there will be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reaſon to expect, where the Soil is not too favourable, (if I may be allow'd to purſue a Figure that will beſt explain it to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reader) it will be a weak and tender Shoot, which we may eaſily weed out, and not one rank Crop upon another, as we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times experience now.</p>
            <p>As for the Time that will be requir'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh all this; it can't be ſuppos'd I ſhou'd preſume to determine it: For, our Phyſicians know, it was ſeveral Years before we were rid of the laſt Plague. It is ſufficient, that the Affair is of ſo much Conſequence, that the Children who are yet unborn demand our Attention to it.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Objection is from the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the People; who are inclin'd to think every Abridgment of their Liberty, tho' it is for their Advantage, inhuman and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous. But in this Inſtance, I know not how it is; Perſons of Quality and Fortune, and very many of the Populace, are almoſt come into this Practice of themſelves, from their own Obſervations and Reaſonings upon the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0205300800:16"/>Head. The Husband and Wife, we have ſeen content to live apart for a Time; or, if they are determin'd againſt it, they might perhaps be indulg'd to perform the <hi>Quarantain</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> as ſtiff-neck'd and rebellious a People as they are repreſented in the Holy Writings, had ſo much regard to their Health, as to ſubmit to a much ſeverer <hi>Regimen.</hi> For there is a vaſt Difference between a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Society for a few Days, which is all this Scheme requires; and theirs, which in ſome Caſes continued for Life.</p>
            <p>I can't doubt, the Worthy and Learned Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Phyſicians, if they came into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, wou'd take care to direct the Execution of it, to a general Satisfaction: And upon this Account, if the Legiſlature made them a Sort of <hi>Office of Inſurance;</hi> the Contributions they would receive from the whole Nation, and the Voluntary Benefactions of very many, to whoſe Families this Diſtemper hath been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, would, I'm perſuaded, render them very capable of diſcharging that Service, by their Agents, with great Applauſe. I might ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0205300800:17"/>the Pleaſure they muſt have by that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence this would eſtabliſh, to obſerve the State of Diſeaſes and Phyſick through the whole Nation, and to direct the Practice of it in this Inſtance: Which laſt is a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of too much Weight, not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to the Publick: For, if any Thing can, it muſt reconcile every Perſon to this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; That He, and his Relations, tho' they are the meaneſt of the People, (among whom this Diſtemper generally lodges) will have proper Medicines and Attendance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Care of the moſt Learned Body of Phyſicians in the World.</p>
