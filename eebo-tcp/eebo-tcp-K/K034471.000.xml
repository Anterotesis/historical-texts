            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>Spoken by Mrs. BULKLEY.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>OUR author, all ſubmiſſion, ſends me here,</l>
               <l>To make excuſes for your ſimple cheer;</l>
               <l>And I, that have no intereſt in his ſcenes,</l>
               <l>Muſt bear the train of tragic kings and queens.</l>
               <l>Shall I ſupport the weakneſs of his Muſe?—</l>
               <l>Egad—if ſo—I'll fit him with abuſe—</l>
               <l>I'll ſoon diſſect his fine-ſpun work, and ſhow</l>
               <l>That all his plot has more of farce than woe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For, after all, the creature's much deceiv'd,</l>
               <l>If e'er he thinks his tale can be believ'd.</l>
               <l>So tame and ſo inanimate his maid is—</l>
               <l>How very different from our modern ladies!—</l>
               <l>What, could a blooming laſs with ripen'd charms,</l>
               <l>Be held ſo long from her admirer's arms?—</l>
               <l>If ſuch were truths in prudiſh Heathen climes,</l>
               <l>Examples vary in our later times—</l>
               <l>Then for theatric play—how poor! how cold!</l>
               <l>A heroine's language ſhould be nobly bold,</l>
               <l>Outſtrip the decency of vulgar life,</l>
               <l>Mouth at the Heavens, and ſet the Gods at ſtrife.—</l>
               <l>Time was indeed, an antiquated bard</l>
               <l>Paid to that beldame, Nature, ſome regard,</l>
               <l>And drew his females with ſuch ſimple features,</l>
               <l>That all, who ſaw, believ'd them human creatures.</l>
               <l>Plain <hi>Deſdemona</hi> bore no trace of art,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Portia</hi> play'd a wife's domeſtic part;</l>
               <l>While <hi>Conſtance</hi> ſhew'd, but what before we knew,</l>
               <l>And only griev'd, as real mothers do.—</l>
               <l>Shall this ſtale poet give the Drama law,</l>
               <l>Who poorly copied only what he ſaw?</l>
               <l>Nay, ſtole from life, in every clime and age,</l>
               <l>The characters that fill his boaſted page?—</l>

               <l>Well! as I live, 'tis he!<hi>—(looking out)—</hi>O, axe you come?</l>
               <l>Does all go well?—poor devil!—ſeal his doom.</l>
               <l>This live-long night he watches every eye,</l>
               <l>Talks, like his heroes, in ſoliloquy—</l>
               <l>Then ſtarts aſide—"What! ſomething goes amiſs?—</l>
               <l>"Sure 'tis the diſtant murmur of a hiſs!"—</l>
               <l>Alas! kind ſoul!—I pity his condition,</l>
               <l>And will in his behalf this Houſe petition:—</l>
               <l>To you, good folks above, for ever ready</l>
               <l>To ſerve a friend, all Engliſh hearts and ſteady!</l>
               <l>To you, ye men of candour, ſenſe, and wit,</l>
               <l>Who fill the circle of this awful pit;</l>
               <l>To you, ye ladies, ever prone to ſpare</l>
               <l>The bard, who love and beauty makes his care;</l>
               <l>I here commend him—take him to your favour,</l>
               <l>And I'll be ſurety for his good behaviour.</l>
