            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Papilio Iris is eſteemed among the beautiful, and placed with the rare of the <hi>Engliſh Lepidoptera.</hi> The curſory reader may not perceive that ſuperiority, particularly as many of the minute Inſects infinitely excel in real beauty and richneſs of colouring; but the ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tific

will be ever ready to give it the firſt place as a Britiſh Papilio, and to thoſe a figure of the Caterpillar and Chryſalis will be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable acquiſition. It derives the title of Purple High Flyer, as it very rarely deſcends to the ground; except in ſome few inſtances, it has never been taken but in the moſt elevated ſituations, and even thoſe inſtances have been after a ſtrong wind, or heavy rain: The tops of the loftieſt foreſt trees afford it an aſylum, and in the Caterpillar and Chryſalis ſtate, it is preſerved from the wanton cruelty of man, by the almoſt inacceſſible height of its habitation. They feed on the Sallow, <hi>ſalix caprea,</hi> and the Caterpillars are obtained by beating the branches of the tree with a pole twenty or thirty feet in length; it is then but a neceſſary precaution to cover the ground beneath with large ſheets to a certain diſtance, or the inſects which fall, will be loſt among the herbage.</p>
                  <p>It is in Caterpillar about <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June;</hi> it paſſes to the Chryſalis ſtate, and in <hi>July</hi> or <hi>Auguſt</hi> is a Papilio.</p>
                  <p>The great difficulty and trouble to rear the Caterpillars, when found; and greater difficulty to take the Fly, has ſtamped a valuable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration on it, and particularly ſo when fine, and a high price is but eſteemed an adequate compenſation for it if in good preſervation. The male is ſmaller, but more beautiful than the female; the upper ſide of the wings of the female not being enriched with that vivid change of purple which the male poſſeſſes in ſuch an eminent degree; but the underſide of the female is far richer in the various teints of colour than the male: they are both beautifully ſpotted, mottled, and waved with brown, black, white, and orange. The Chryſalis is of a very delicate texture, much reſembling thin white paper, and is tinged in ſeveral parts with a very lively purple hue which it borrows from the wings of the encloſed inſect, and bears the characteriſtic mark of a Papilio, by being ſuſpended from the tail, with the head downward.</p>

                  <p>Many ſpecies of the <hi>Cimex</hi> genus differ ſo materially in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral form, that very nice attention is neceſſary to diſcriminate the ſpecies which evidently belong to this extenſive family. The external appearance of the Houſe, or Scarlet Bug, cannot intimate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection to the ſame genus with this ſlender bodied inſect; but ſo they are arranged by Linnaeus, and ſo they will appear on a proper inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe parts which conſtitute their generic character.</p>
                  <p>The preſent ſpecies is common, and may be taken during great part of the warm ſeaſons. We have an Inſect of the ſame genus <hi>(Cimex Lacuſtris)</hi> which has frequently attracted notice by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and activity of its motions, when ſporting on the ſurface of ſtagnant pools, or other ſtanding water: It appears to fly, or ſkim the ſurface, but its wings are not often expanded, the lightneſs of its body
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0622600702:7"/>
and length of its legs, permitting it to dart with great velocity in any direction, and when it alights, it cauſes only a gentle tremulous motion beneath it. Its habits have much affinity to the generality of aquatic inſects, and being conſtantly found on that element, would almoſt determine it to be of that race; but it is rather amphibious, and very rarely deſcends beneath the ſurface. It will at intervals reſt for ſeveral minutes motionleſs on the water, its ſix legs are then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded, and the tarſi of the feet only touch the ſurface; but the <hi>Cimex Stagnorum</hi> is remarkable for the regularity and carefulneſs of all its actions; it rarely runs, but treads the water, ſlow, and ever appears to apprehend danger; it frequently pauſes ſuddenly, and if it then perceives any thing diſagreeable, retires. Aquatic Inſects are generally ſupplied at ſeveral parts of their body with an oily matter that the water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not penetrate, and the legs of this Inſect is apparently poſſeſſed of that property.</p>

The larva is not unlike the adult inſect, though its body js longer and tapering, and it hath no ſhells to defend it if in danger; its ſecurity therefore depends on its feet, which are rather longer, or at leaſt appear longer, than in the after-ſtate; all the ſpecies, whether as the larva or the adult, commonly feed on graſs, but they as frequently are taken on the plantain, thiſtle and roſe, or any other plant, whether wild or cultivated. They faſten themſelves to the leaves of any plant that is near when they enter the Chryſalis ſtate, and its appearance is then as if it were tied to the leaf by threads which paſs each other in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe directions; they remain only a few days in the Chryſalis, as it undergoes but little change. May, June, and July, or later if the weather ſhould prove fine, is the time to find them; many of the ſpecies are ſo numerous in almoſt every ſituation, that collectors give little trouble to obtain them, or at leaſt ſearch for ſuch only as are moſt uncommon.</p>

                     <p>Ichneumons are the moſt voracious of all the winged Inſects;—in their nature, robuſt and powerful, and armed with a formidable ſting; they are the dread, and deſtroyer of other tribes, and mortal enemies to each other; like the animal <note n="*" place="bottom">The Ichneumon is a well known animal in Egypt, particularly near the river Nile, and are uſeful for deſtroying the Eggs of the Crocodile, &amp;c.</note> whence their ſignificant appellation is derived, they exiſt by rapine and plunder, and ſupport their infant offspring on the vitals of larger Inſects.</p>
                     <p>The female Ichneumon, when ready to lay her eggs, is ſeen eagerly ruſhing from one plant to another, if its prey offers, which is generally the Larva of the <hi>Phalaena, Papilio,</hi> &amp;c. it darts down with the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of an eagle, and graſps the tender body in its claws; it is now in vain that the unwieldy animal attempts reſiſtance, as all its efforts are but the ſport of a ſavage conqueror. For raiſing the body almoſt upright, or into the form of a bow, the creature returns it in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and daſhes the ſting up to the baſe, in the ſofteſt part of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillar's body; this, if undiſturbed, it will repeat thirty or forty times, always chooſing a freſh ſpot for every new wound, and often entirely ſcarifying the Inſect. The ſtung animal refuſes to eat, and ſometimes its illneſs terminates in its death, though generally the eggs are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and the Inſects produced from the living body, ſo that if it ſurvives its miſery, and the wounds heal, the heat of the body ripens the embryos, and the young Ichneumons gnaw, and tear large paſſages through the body, to complete their delivery.

                     <p>It is by no means for the beauty, but ſingularity of this creature that we have given it a place in our preſent ſelection. If it is too perfect for the larva of an Inſect, it certainly appears too imperfect for the adult ſtate; it has ſhells, but cannot fly, and their length compared with the proportion of the body contributes much to its awkward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. It is very quick-ſighted, and runs with ſwiftneſs when in danger.

                  <p>In Plate 24 of this work we have repreſented the LIBELLULA DEPRESSA in the winged ſtate, and our preſent Figure is, of the Larva of that Inſect. We have before deſcribed it as a ſavage vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious creature in every ſtate of its exiſtence. The Larva, which is an aquatic, feeds on Inſects of that element; and when it becomes adult, Moths, Butterflies, and other winged Inſects are its prey. As Lepidopterous Inſects are not provided with any weapons, defenſive or offenſive, it will encounter the largeſt, graſp them in its claws, and tear them to pieces. Its mouth is ſpacious, and well adapted for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Larvae of moſt winged Inſects paſs to the Aurelia, or Chryſalis ſtate, and thence produce the Fly; but the Larvae of the <hi>Libellulae</hi> never undergoes that change, and though its appearance is altered ſeveral times in its progreſs to perfection, it does not become dormant. When the ultimate period of its laſt change arrives, it crawls to the bank, or ſide of the ditch, and affixing its legs firmly to the ground, or graſs, it collects all its ſtrength, and by one violent effort the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between the Thorax and Abdomen is broken, whence the Head and Thorax is protruded; after ſome pauſe the exuvia is caſt off, and the Wings, which were before enwrapped in the ſhort caſes at the bottom of the Thorax, expand. The creature now entirely formed for flight, only waits a ſhort time to exhale the ſuperfluous moiſture, and then ruſhes into the air, to ſpread havoc and diſorder.</p>

Its firſt proceſs is to make a deep inciſion acroſs the leaf, which it effects with little labour, as its mouth is well armed for the purpoſe; the upper part of the leaf being thus deprived of its ſupport, inſtantly becomes dependent; the Caterpillar embraces the two ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces of the fractured leaf, and weaves its web between.

                     <p>The Genus <hi>Tipula,</hi> compriſes an extenſive family of the Dipterous Order, or of ſuch Inſects as are furniſhed with two Wings only. Our largeſt Species are <hi>Tip.</hi> Rivoſa, Crocata, Lunata, &amp;c. the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is <hi>T.</hi> Oleracea, generally known by the trivial appellations, <hi>Long Legs, Old Father,</hi> &amp;c. It is, as are alſo the other Species, perfectly harmleſs and inoffenſive; yet their ſingular form, and more particularly the extraordinary diſproportion of their legs, operates frequently to their diſadvantage with the ignorant, who readily ſuppoſe they have to avoid, the ſecreted ſting, of whatever appears aukward or uncommon.</p>
                     <p>Our ſmaller Species are infinitely more numerous, and many of them are not deſcribed, being ſo very minute as to remain unnoticed. The <hi>Tipula Plumoſa,</hi> Plate XXII, differs materially in its general appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the larger kinds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0622600702:37"/>We rarely find a ſpecimen of the larger kinds of Tipula with the legs complete; the loſs of one or two of thoſe members do not materially retard the briſkneſs of its motions, but it cannot fly after ſuffering a total amputation, though it will then live a conſiderable time.</p>
                     <p>The Tipula Rivoſa being entangled by two of its legs in the ſnare of a large ſpider [ARANEA DIADEMA], at firſt endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage them by force, but this rather added to its calamity, and a third leg was attracted by the glutinous matter on the threads; the ſpider approached, and the creature accelerated its eſcape by leaving its legs in the web. It is very common to obſerve the broken limbs of the <hi>Tipulae</hi> in the ſnares of this ſpecies of ſpider.</p>
                     <p>The Larvae of many Tipulae, more eſpecially the very minute ſorts, are found in ſtanding water, but the larger, generally feed on the roots of graſs, and may be found by turning up the light ſurface of the earth. The Tipula Rivoſa is taken in May and June, the Tipula Crocata in June and July; the latter is obſerved in the flower-garden or orchard.</p>

                  <p>The Genus <hi>Aranea</hi> includes a vaſt, if not endleſs variety of ſpecies, and though the greateſt diſſimilarity may be obſerved as to ſize, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, or colouring, of many individual kinds, yet the rapaciouſneſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0622600702:40"/>
common to the family, is apparent in all. Our domeſtic Spiders are plain in their colours, and ſeldom attain a very extraordinary ſize; the gardens are infeſted by ſpecies ſomewhat larger, and more lively in their marks and teints, but if we wiſh to trace the juſt gradations of the beauty, or ſize, of thoſe deteſtable creatures, the foreſts abound; and will afford the higheſt gratification to the enquiries of the naturaliſt. We have Spiders purely white, or white ſtained with a lovely green; yellow, marked with a vivid red; purples ſhaded with the richeſt hues, and the brighteſt browns, beſpangled with the utmoſt elegance and ſymmetry: Yet under thoſe rich adornments which nature has ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely beſtowed on this complication of beauty, and ferocity, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover inherent qualities, which, in larger animals, would become formidable, and though we feel confident of our ſuperiority over the inſidious art of ſuch a contemptible creature, yet the mind is ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an inward abhorrence at its touch, which neither the expanſion of philoſophy, or ignorance of its diſpoſition, will ſometimes ſuppreſs.

                  <p>Early in the ſpring we find the neſts of Spiders in the crevices of old walls, trees, and other obſcure places. They are encloſed in webs of a white, yellow, or grey colour, varying according to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0622600702:41"/>
ſpecies; immediately that the warmth of the ſun has hatched them, they diſperſe, it being no longer neceſſary to live in ſocieties, which indeed, would deprive ſome of their ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>In February we took a neſt of minute yellowiſh eggs, which proved to be the infant offspring of the A. Diadema, they ſcarcely exceeded the ſize of a pin's head when hatched, and were of a bright yellow colour; at firſt their food was the common houſe fly, but their increaſe in bulk was ſo rapid that it was neceſſary to deſtroy many, to preſerve a few; we therefore ſelected four ſpecimens, which being fed in ſeparate glaſſes, and on different inſects, exhibited each a diſtinct degree of ſtrength, and colour. One ſpecimen deſtroyed thirty of the common houſe fly in a day; it then appeared much enlarged, and the colours were almoſt black, except the ſpots of white, which ſparkled with infinite luſtre; but being confined a week without a freſh ſupply, its colours were conſiderably faded; another week of abſtinence reduced its colours to a pale uniform brown, the body was much waſted, and the creature became perfectly ravenous. It devoured a vaſt quantity of food, and recovered much of its former colours a few hours after.</p>
                  <p>Our largeſt Spiders are incomparable for their ſize, or venomous qualities, to the productions of America, or of the eaſtern countries; in Germany they are far ſuperior in ſize to our ſpecimens, but in Surinam they are infinitely ſurpaſſed, Spiders of thoſe parts being often found with legs as thick as a gooſe-quill, and three or four inches in length, which with difficulty ſupport a body as large as a pullet's egg. Their ſnares are commonly extended from one branch of a tree to another, covering the ſpace of twenty or thirty feet, and is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtrong to entangle the largeſt inſects. A. Seba has figured a Spider of this deſcription, as deſcending from an arm of a tree, into the neſt of a ſmall ſpecies of Humming Bird, to ſuck the blood of the parent, and eggs.</p>
                  <p>"The eyes of the Spider are a very beautiful microſcopic object, viewed either as tranſparent or opake; they have generally eight, two on the top of the head, that look directly upwards; two in the front, a little below the foregoing, to diſcover what paſſes before it; and on each ſide a couple more, one whereof points ſideways forward, the other ſideways backward; ſo that it can ſee almoſt all around it. They are immoveable, and ſeem to be formed of a hard, tranſparent, horny ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The number of eyes is not the ſame in all the ſpecies of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0622600702:42"/>
Spider. They have eight legs, with ſix joints, thickly beſet with hairs, and terminating in two crooked moveable claws, which have little teeth like a ſaw; at a ſmall diſtance from theſe claws, but placed higher up, is another, ſomewhat like a cock's ſpur, by the aſſiſtance of which it adheres to it's webs; but the weapon wherewith it ſeizes and kills its prey is a pair of ſharp crooked claws, or forceps, placed in the fore-part of the head. They can open or extend theſe pincers as occaſion may require; when undiſturbed they ſuffer them to lie one upon another. Mr. <hi>Lewenhoeck</hi> ſays, that each of theſe claws has a ſmall aperture, or ſlit, through which he ſuppoſes a poiſonous juice is injected into the wound it makes.</p>
                  <p>"The exuvia of the Spider, which may be found in cobwebs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſparent, is an excellent object; and the fangs, or forceps, may be eaſier ſeparated from it, and examined with more exactneſs than in a living Spider. The contexture of the Spider's web, and their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of weaving them, have been diſcovered by the microſcope. The Spider is ſupplied with a large quantity of glutinous matter within it's body, and five dugs, or teats, for ſpinning it into thread. This ſubſtance, when examined accurately, will be found twiſted into many coils, of an agate colour, and which, from its tenacity, may be eaſily drawn out into threads. The five teats are placed near the extremity of its tail; from theſe the aforeſaid ſubſtance proceeds; it adheres to any thing it is preſſed againſt, and being drawn out, hardens in the air. The Spider can contract or dilate at pleaſure the orifices through which the threads are drawn. The threads unite at a ſmall diſtance from the body, ſo that thoſe which appear to us ſo fine and ſingle, are notwithſtanding compoſed of five joined together, and theſe are many times doubled when the web is in formation."</p>

                  <p>A very elegant, though common Species of the Sphinx <hi>Genus:</hi> it is taken in the months June and July. After the Inſect dies, the colour of the thorax and abdomen, except the yellow bands, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely black, or black with a very faint gloſs of a reddiſh blue: but is an exceedingly brilliant dark purple, while the creature is alive; and the yellow belts on the alternate diviſions of the body, glitter in the ſunſhine with the effulgence of molten gold. The legs are yet more beautiful, as the purple, though paler, is of a livelier luſtre; and every joint is deeply fringed with the ſame golden colour as that on the body.

                        <hi>Cicada Spumaria</hi> is not only common in this country, but is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in every part of Europe. It frequents moſt plants, but thoſe eſpecially which exhale much moiſture. The food of the Larva ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears entirely of the vegetable kind, and conſiſts, for the moſt part, of the ſuperabundant fluids which all plants tranſpire.</p>
                     <p>"The CUCKOW-SPIT, or FROTH-WORM, is often found hid in that frothy matter which we find on the ſurface of plants. It has an oblong, obtuſe body; and a large head, with ſmall eyes. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Wings, for it hath four, are of a duſky brown colour, marked with two white ſpots: the head is black. The ſpume in which it is found wallowing, is all of its own formation, and very much reſembles frothy ſpittle. It proceeds from the vent of the animal, and other parts of the body; and, if it be wiped away, a new quantity will be quickly ſeen ejected from the little animal's body. Within this ſpume, it is ſeen in time to acquire four tubercles on its back, wherein the wings are encloſed: theſe burſting, from a reptile it becomes a winged animal."</p>
                     <p>The colour of the winged Inſect is found to vary from a deep cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate, to a very pale brown. It is taken in July and Auguſt.</p>
                     <p>It rarely uſes its wings for flight, as the hind legs are formed for leaping; at one effort it will frequently bound to the diſtance of two or three yards.</p>

The inferior wings are of a yellowiſh-white, with a ſhade of purple, a dark ſpot on the middle, and a pale black, broad border, with a white fringe.</p>

                  <p>This elegant ſpecies of the <hi>Noctua</hi> diviſion of Moths, appears to be not only a nondeſcript, but altogether unknown before; even to the beſt practical entymologiſts: That an inſect of ſuch magnitude ſhould have been unnoticed by <hi>Linnaeus,</hi> or <hi>Fabricius,</hi> is not very ſingular, as ſeveral nondeſcripts of a ſimilar, and many of an inferior,

ſize, are to be ſeen in almoſt every cabinet; but that the ſpecies ſhould have eſcaped the reſearches of the moſt eminent collectors, is rather aſtoniſhing.</p>
                  <p>We have ſought every information which our connection would permit; and from the reſult we ſcarcely heſitate to pronounce the inſect of a nondeſcript ſpecies, and our ſpecimen to be perfectly unique; at leaſt it is a newly-diſcovered acquiſition to many ſcientific entymologiſts.</p>
                  <p>The original, whence the figure has been copied, is in the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the author; it was taken in a lane leading immediately from the wood at <hi>Tottenham,</hi> the laſt week in June, 1793. It was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the evening, on a blade of graſs; and, from its wet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, as well as exquiſite preſervation, it had certainly juſt emerged from its chryſalis.</p>
                  <p>The Caterpillar may be ſuppoſed to be an underground feeder, and to ſubſiſt on the roots of graſs, &amp;c. or one of that kind which comes only above the ſurface of the earth in the night.</p>

                  <p>The underſide, from the greater tenacity of the ſkin, or ſhelly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is leſs liable to alteration than the upper ſide; it is entirely of a dark, but beautiful purple, which is changeable in proportion to the convexity of the body, to the moſt brilliant hues; the legs are alſo of a beautiful purple, with the appearance of bronze or copper colour intermixed.</p>

                  <p>This ſpecies is found in every part of Europe, though very ſcarce; and in England it is extremely rare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0622600702:115"/>And it is no leſs diſtinguiſhed for the very ſingular ſtructure and length of its antennae, than for its rarity; that part which forms one of the moſt certain characteriſtics of almoſt every tribe of Inſects, conſtitutes the moſt prominent character in this.</p>
                  <p>Of its uſe, we are altogether ignorant, as the various opinions that have been given by former writers are now obliterated; ſome have ſuppoſed that they were the organs of hearing, or ſmell; and others have imagined that they were ſuſceptible of the leaſt motion in the ambient fluid in which they move.</p>
                  <p>Geoffroy diſcovered the organs of hearing in ſeveral amphibious animals, viz. in the toad, frog, viper, ſome other ſerpents, lizard, water-ſalamander, and ſkate <note n="*" place="bottom">Memoires Etrangers de l'Acad. de Paris, 1755.</note>; and many of the moſt eminent ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts of the preſent time have diſcovered by their reſearches into the animal kingdom, thoſe organs in different creatures. Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Camper, in 1763, publiſhed remarks on the organs of hearing in fiſhes, in the Harlem Tranſactions <note n="†" place="bottom">In the Year 1763, &amp;c.</note>: Mr. Hunter has deſcribed others in the Philoſophical Tranſactions <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vol. lxxii.</note>; and Dr. Monro has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and figured great variety of them in his large work on the ſtructure and phyſiology of fiſhes.</p>
                  <p>Probably, induced by thoſe diſcoveries profeſſor Fabricius endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to aſcertain the organs of hearing in Inſects alſo; and about nine years ago publiſhed an account of this intereſting diſcovery in the New Copenhagen Tranſactions <note n="§" place="bottom">Vol. ii. p. 375.</note>, with figures of thoſe organs in the crab and lobſter: he found the external orifice of the organ in theſe animals to be placed between the long and the ſhort antennae, the cochlea, &amp;c. being lodged in the upper part, which Linnaeus calls the thorax, near the baſe of the ſerrated projection at its apex; we muſt therefore conclude that the antennae of Inſects are appropriated for ſome other purpoſes than thoſe it is at preſent ſuſpected they anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The Cerambyx Aedilis, Fabricius informs us, lives in the trunks of trees; its horns are moveable, as it can either direct them forward, or ſupport them in an erect poſition; and when it ſleeps, it reclines them along its back; it alſo reclines them when it walks quick, or has to paſs through a narrow track, as the leaſt reſiſtance from any thing in its way, would be very liable to injure, or break them off.</p>
                  <p>Our ſpecimen was taken in May.</p>
