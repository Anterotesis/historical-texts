            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I ſhall dread to take up my ſhears to make a meaſure, for fear they ſhould take an affidavit I'm going to ſnip off their noſes. My prentice-boy is a Muſſulman, and if I ſhould kick him, though I even caught him cribbing my cabbage, I'm lug'd before the Cadi, and baſtinado'd with my own lapboard. My wife is ſo buſy preparing our ſupper, that I fancy ſhe hasn't heard me <stage>(knocks loud).</stage> Abſalom and Dora by this time are married, and if they bring the jolly father, Anſelm, with them, I've got a glaſs of good wine here <stage>(pointing to his baſket)</stage> It's neceſſary; for this plaguy proclamation has let down my ſpirits, and taken away my appetite—dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to be in the ſtreet! Now if we had all our little company ſafe within the walls of my caſtle, and ſome merry fellow to tickle the guitar, while I tune up my ſmall pipes in a chearful ſong, I'd lock my doors
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0054801900:18"/>for the night, and we'd all be as ſnug as the lady in the lobſter <stage>(Crumpy ſings without).</stage> What's yonder! a Muſſulman! I'll get out of his way <stage>(knocks very loud at his door)</stage>—Deafen this wife of mine. Juggy!</p>

I begin to deſpair of an adventure—Though by my office, I'm privileged to ſay what I pleaſe, yet the character of jeſter is difficult to ſupport.—He! he! he! my introducing the barber into his preſence was rather lucky; yet, damn it, I've got ſome how flat—being obliged to tell the ſame ſtory three times over, and my patron is always gaping for new jokes, like boys at bob-cherry—Eh! for a nice neat ſtory to have for the Baſſa, ſpick and ſpan!—I'd venture a few knocks o'the pate, or even get into a hobble for one—but, zounds!—I can meet with no living being, except our Turks, and they're ſo muz'd with their betel and opium—my only gig is amongſt Jews and Chriſtians—none can I meet—the devil!—I can't make fun out of the poſts and window-ſhutters!

Ha! ha! ha!—I ſhould like to invite him in, his guitar would add ſuch life to our little entertainment <stage>(aſide)</stage>— <stage>(Crumpy plays)</stage> Oh! ſweet!—I think as we are all ſuch quiet folks, there's no danger of a quarrel to bring us under the penalty of the proclamation—I'm ſtrongly tempted to venture—Juggy, come here and liſten—ſhe is ſo
