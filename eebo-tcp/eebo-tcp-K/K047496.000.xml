            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving been employed on a Voyage into the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> under the Command of Capt. <hi>Dampier,</hi> in the Year 1703, and having
<pb facs="tcp:0698300300:3"/>
both in that Expedition, and in my Return by the Eaſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the South-Sea, and through the <hi>Indian</hi>-Ocean, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked not only faithfully, but with all the Accuracy I could, whatever I conceived might be ſerviceable, or inſtructive to ſuch as ſhould hereafter ſail into thoſe Parts, I hope you will pardon my Preſuption in laying my ſaid Obſervations before you.</p>
            <p>I humbly take the Liberty to repreſent to you, that I have launched forth into no Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or particular Accounts of Things, which the Courſe of my Voyage gave me not ſufficient Opportunity to be
<pb facs="tcp:0698300300:4"/>
fully and perfectedly inſtructed in, and I ſpared no Pains in the ſetting them down, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Draughts of ſuch Places as I had time or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of taking; and in all this I have not through any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of contradicting others, or in hopes thereby to recommend my own Performance, either oppoſed or ſlighted any good and true Obſervations which have already been made by thoſe who have heretofore viſited any of the ſame Places. This I preſume to mention, with a particular regard to the moſt material of Captain <hi>Dampier</hi>'s own Obſervations, formerly publiſhed, which I found by
<pb facs="tcp:0698300300:5"/>
Experience to be true: But I hope I may, without breach of Modeſty, declare that I have remarked ſeveral things both new and uſeful, which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Courſe we ſteared, and the unuſual Accidents we met with, gave me particular Opportunities to enquire into.</p>
            <p>Sir, I am not pretending to a meritorious Claim of your Protection, but am encourag'd to hope for it from your known Candour and Goodneſs: And it is very natural to flatter our ſelves, that Perſons of your Judgment and Experience in Maritime Affairs, will look with a more favourable Eye,
<pb facs="tcp:0698300300:6"/>
even on our meaneſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, than thoſe can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to do, who know but little of thoſe Matters, and are apt to prefer ſuperficial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, which are frequently very erroneous, before the moſt uſeful, though leſs diverting. However it be, if I can be ſo happy as to receive any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from your diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgment, or at leaſt your Pardon for this my Boldneſs, I ſhall not fear that any Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Prejudice of leſs diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons, can diſcredit the Truth, or Uſefulneſs of my Obſervations.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, Sir, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I ought to encroach upon
<pb facs="tcp:0698300300:7"/>
your Time, which is ſo uſefully and ſo diligently employed: And therefore I humbly beg leave to conclude with ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing my ſelf,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE Voyages and Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions formerly publiſhed by Captain <hi>William Dampier,</hi> have met with ſo good Reception and univerſal Approbation in the World; and there has been ſo general an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Succeſs of the preſent Expedition, under the Command of a Perſon ſo perfectly acquainted with thoſe Parts of the World to which we were
<pb facs="tcp:0698300300:9"/>
bound, and ſo well skilled in the Trade, Shipping, Cuſtoms and Deſigns of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> againſt whom we were employed; that I preſume there needs no Apology, for publiſhing the following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>The Succeſs indeed of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, was not ſuch as might at firſt have been expected from the Skill of our Commander and the Reſolution of our Men. Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements and Miſmanagements having broken our Meaſures, and defeated our moſt promiſing Hopes; as they have often been Occaſions of the miſcarriage of the greateſt and nobleſt Attempts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0698300300:10"/>
But though we failed in our chief Deſigns; yet the great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Accidents we met with, and the many Diſcoveries we made, and particular Accounts of the manner how our Attempts miſcarried, I hope cannot but be very acceptable to the inquiſitive Reader.</p>
            <p>I have choſen not to be large in the Deſcriptions of Towns and Places, of which others have already given us ſufficient Accounts. But the whole Weſtern Coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> from the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of <hi>California</hi> to the Port of <hi>Valdivia,</hi> which is above ſixty Degrees, I have given one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and much more particular
<pb facs="tcp:0698300300:11"/>
Deſcription of, than has ever yet been made publick; and alſo I have given an exact Account of the Variation of the Compaſs upon the whole Coaſt. And though it may perhaps by ſome be thought not ſo pleaſant and entertaining, as Deſcriptions of the Country within Land; yet it cannot but be much more uſeful, eſpecially to ſuch as ſhall hereafter ſail into thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot in juſtice but take notice, that upon all this Coaſt, and during our whole ſtay in the South Seas, we found Captain <hi>Dampier</hi>'s Deſcriptions of Places very exact; and his
<pb facs="tcp:0698300300:12"/>
Account of Winds, Currents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> very extraordinary.</p>
            <p>After our parting from Capt. <hi>Dampier</hi> in the Gulf of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palla,</hi> and running over to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi> we met, as with many Hardſhips, ſo alſo with ſome Variety of new Diſcoveries, in our wandering among un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Spice-Iſlands: And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Miſfortunes, which neceſſitated us to put in at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> where we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Priſoners by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> gave me an opportunity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch Enquiries into the State, Government, Product, Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of that Iſland,
<pb facs="tcp:0698300300:13"/>
as I perſwade my ſelf will be very acceptable to the ingenious Reader.</p>

for the South-Seas: The one was named the St <hi>George,</hi> Captain <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Dampier</hi> Commander, on Board of which I was; and the other was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Fame, John Pulling</hi> Captain. We were each of us ſupplied with all War-like Stores, and very well victualled for nine Months; and had Commiſſions from his Royal Highneſs the Lord High-Admiral, to proceed in a War-like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards:</hi> And we Both were upon the ſame Terms, of no Purchaſe no Pay. But whilſt we were in the <hi>Downs,</hi> there ariſing ſome Difference between the two Captains, Captain <hi>Pulling</hi> in his Ship the <hi>Fame</hi> went away and left us; intending, as he ſaid, to go and cruize among the <hi>Canary-Iſlands;</hi> and we never ſaw him after. But before our going away from <hi>Ireland,</hi> we were joyned by another Ship ſent after us on purpoſe. She was a ſmall Ship, named the <hi>Cinque-ports</hi> Gally, burthen about ninety Tuns, ſixteen Guns, and ſixty three Men, <hi>Charles Pickering</hi> Captain: Which Ship was alſo very well victualled and provided for the ſaid Voyage. Our Propoſals were to go into the River of <hi>Plate,</hi> to <hi>Buonas Aires,</hi> to take two or three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galleons which Captain <hi>Dampier</hi> gives an account are uſually there: And if by that Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we got to the value of 600000 Pounds,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0698300300:27"/>
then to return again without proceeding further: But if we miſſed of Succeſs there, then to cruize upon the Coaſt of <hi>Peru,</hi> for the <hi>Valdivia</hi> Ships, which commonly are ſaid to bring down ſtore of Gold to <hi>Lima:</hi> But if that Deſign ſhould alſo fail, then to attempt ſome rich Towns, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Captain <hi>Dampier</hi> ſhould think fit: And after that, we were at the uſual time of the Year to go down upon the Coaſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> to ſeek for a great Galleon, which Trades from <hi>Manila,</hi> one of the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, to <hi>Acapulco</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co;</hi> and which is commonly reported to be worth thirteen or fourteen Millions of Pieces of Eight.

In this he is like the Lyon; in all other parts quite different; He hath four Fins; the two foremoſt ſerve him, when he goes aſhoar, to raiſe the fore-part of his Body, and then he draws the hinder-part after him; the two hinder Fins are of no uſe to him on Land, but only in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Theſe Creatures are very fat; for which reaſon we kill'd ſeveral of them, and ſoon made us a Tun of Oil for our Lamps; although moſt of us, whilſt we were here, made uſe of it in frying of Fiſh; and indeed it had no unpleaſant taſte. We killed one which was twenty three Feet in length, fourteen foot and a half round, and cut ſeventeen Inches deep in fat. They have ſhort Hair, of a light Colour, but lighter when young, than old; For when old, they look more ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Their Food is Fiſh; for their prey is all in the Water, though they generally come on Land to ſleep; and then five, ſix or ſeven of them will huddle together like Swine, and lie ſo three or four Days if not moleſted. They are very much afraid of a Man; and ſo ſoon as they ſee him any thing near, they will make to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for they never go far from it. If they are hard purſued, they will turn about and

And often times he would find us work enough. But he being an unweildy Creature; and we aſſaulting him both behind, before, and all round; we muſt needs conquer. Yet he often put us to the run; and ſometimes he would run himſelf, but knew not which way, for we commonly got beeween the Water and him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seals</hi> are much of the ſame kind; only their Heads are like a Hounds. They howl like Dogs, when old; and bark like them, when young.

When they come out of the Sea, they bleat like Sheep for their Young; which, though they are to paſs through Thouſands both young and old, yet will find out their own Damm to ſuck; For none of them will ſuffer any Young to ſuck them, but only their own. Both young and old love much to lie aſhoar; but when beaten by us, they make to the Sea; and a ſmall blow on the Noſe ſoon kills them. I have eaten of theſe Seals often, but it was to ſave better Victuals; however they eat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably well, to thoſe that are very hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and have no other Meat.

He ſeeing us get under ſail, tackt and ſtood from us; and we made the beſt of our way after him; and our Conſort made what haſte he could after us; and about eleven at Night we came cloſe up with him, but did not think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to engage till Day. In this chace our Pinnace towed under Water; ſo we cut her looſe. Captain <hi>Stradling</hi>'s Boat alſo broke looſe, and in her was a Man and a Dog. At Sun-riſe the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, being <hi>March</hi> the 1ſt, we began to engage the ſaid Ship; which was a <hi>French</hi> Ship of about four hundred Tuns, and thirty Guns, well-mann'd. We fought her very cloſe, broad-ſide and broad-ſide, for ſeven Hours; and then a ſmall Gale ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, ſhe ſhear'd off. As for our Conſort, he fir'd about ten or twelve Guns, and then fell a Stern, and never came up again during the Fight. We had nine of our Men killed in the Fight, and ſeveral wounded. We were deſirous to have the other Tryal with him, knowing it would be of dangerous Conſequence to let him go; for if we did, we were ſure he would diſcover us to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which would

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1704</label> be of ill Conſequence to our whole Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: But our Captain was againſt it, ſaying, that at the worſt, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould know of our being in thoſe Seas, and ſo ſhould hinder their Merchant-ſhips from coming out, yet that he knew where to go and could not fail of taking to the value of 500000 <hi>l.</hi> any Day in the Year. Upon this we lay by for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, who ſoon came up; And it was quickly agreed between the two Captains to let her go. So the Enemy ſtood from us, I ſuppoſe very well ſatisfied that he had diſappointed us both: And we were very much diſſatisfied that we ſhould ſuffer our ſelves to be ſo baffled in our firſt Attempt: But however, ſince it was ſo, we conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to return to <hi>Juan Fernando</hi>'s, to get our Anchors, Cables, Long-boats, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Tun of Water casked, with a Tun of Sea-Lions Oyl, which we had left there: And Captain <hi>Stradling</hi> had left five of his Men, who were gone to the Weſt part of the Iſland, and knew nothing of our going out after the Enemy. He had alſo left behind him all his Sails, except thoſe at the Yards, with a great many other Stores. Accordingly we ſtood away towards the ſaid Iſland; and on the 3d ſaw the Iſland bearing South, diſtant about nine or ten Leagues. We had then the Wind at South, right off the Land; ſo that we found it

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1704</label> very difficult to get up with it. But it falling calm, the <hi>Cinque-ports</hi> put out her Oars, and rowed towards the Iſland. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after which, we ſaw two Sail. The <hi>Cinque-ports</hi> was pretty near them, and they fired at her ſeveral ſhots; but ſhe rowed away to us, and gave us an account that they were two <hi>French</hi> Ships, each of about thirty ſix Guns: So the two Captains thought it convenient not to go in, but to go away for the Coaſt of <hi>Peru;</hi> leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind Capt. <hi>Stradling</hi>'s five Men, with other Neceſſaries that we could ill ſpare: For now we had neither of us any Boats. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, according to their Agreement, on <hi>March</hi> the 6th, we ſtood away for the Coaſt of <hi>Peru;</hi> and on the 11th fell in with the Land; it being very high, three rows of Hills one within another; that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Water loweſt, and that towards the Land higheſt. We were then in the Latitude of 24 d. 53 m. S. From thence we coaſted along ſhore to the Northward; and on the 14th paſt by the Port of <hi>Copiapo,</hi> whoſe Latitude is 21 d. 00 m. S. We obſerved here, and found the Variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by AZ<hi>th</hi> Compaſs to be 2 d. 50 m. Eaſterly.</p>
               <p>This is ſaid to be a very good Port, and to be fenced from almoſt all Winds. Near to the Port are four or five Rocks; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Land it is inhahited by <hi>Indians,</hi> who

In this Port they load Wine, Money, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goods for <hi>Coquimbo.</hi> We would very willingly have gone aſhoar here to have got ſome Refreſhment, but could not for want of Boats. The Land continues to be very high and mountainous, ſo that I think it is the higheſt Land I ever ſaw. We kept ſtill cruizing down along ſhore.</p>
               <p>The 19th Inſtant, our Men being all at Dinner, and our Ship about ten Leagues off Shore, going with a fine freſh Gale of Wind at Eaſt, we were ſuddenly ſurprized with the change of the Colour of the Water, which looked as red as Blood to as great a diſtance as we could ſee, which might be about ſeven or eight Leagues. At firſt we were mightily ſurprized; but recollecting our ſelves, we ſounded, but had no Ground at one hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Fathom. We then drew ſome Water up in Buckets, and poured ſome into a Glaſs. It ſtill continued to look very red, till about a quarter of an Hour after it had been in the Glaſs; when all the red Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance floated at top, and the Water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath was as clear as uſual. The red which floated at top, was of a ſlimy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, with little Knobs; and we all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it could be nothing but the Spawn

               <p>From the Latitude of 16 d. 11 m.

Here They likewiſe make abundance of Sea-fiſh-Oil. Having narrowly eſcaped theſe Rocks, we ſtood away to the Northward, and ſoon deſcryed two Sail.

               <p>Being therefore very much diſcontented, we again ſtood along ſhore to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and the next Day in the Morning, being <hi>March</hi> the 24th, we ſaw a Sail which we gave chaſe to, and came up with her, and took her without any reſiſtance; She

On the 4th of <hi>April</hi> this ſecond Prize, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had taken out a few odd Things, was, contrary to moſt of our Minds, diſmiſt; the Captain alledging, that he would not cumber up his Ship, for that he intended to make a Voyage at one ſtroke upon ſome rich Town, on which he had a ſpeedy Deſign.</p>

This is a very noted Iſland: When you are to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, it appears in three Hummocks, which at a diſtance look like three Iſlands; and the Land between each Hummock, is very low. But when you are to the N. W. of it, at the South end you will ſee a ſmall Iſland, or rather Rock, which looks very much like a Ship under ſail; And when you are at the North end, you will ſo open the Land, as that you will ſee part of it does not join to the Iſland, as it ſeems to do when you are to the VVeſtward of it. At the N. E. end of this Iſland are three ſmall Iſlands, or rather Rocks; the one of which is pretty high, and at a diſtance looks like a Barn; and the other two look like two Sail of Ships. At this Iſland you may ſee the main Land, which is very low near the VVater-ſide, but prodigious high up into the Country.

               <p>They are about the bigneſs of a Man's Arm. I meaſured one, which from the Head to the end of the Tail, was three foot eleven Inches. He has a large ſort of a Comb upon his Head, which ſtands up like a Helmet or Head-piece to defend his Head. When he is aſſaulted or frightned, he ſets his Comb up an end; but otherwiſe it lies down flat in a deep Dent in his Head, juſt fitted to it; ſo that when it is down, it can hardly be perceived. He has two very large Eyes; a large Mouth, with a great many fine ſmall ſharp Teeth. His Skin is very tough, of a ſad Colour; full of black, yellow and blueiſh Spots: In all other things he reſembles the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lizard.

               <p>On the 21ſt we ſaw a Sail, and ſtood towards her; and next day, being <hi>July</hi> the 22d, came up with her. She proved to be one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Men of War which was fitted out on purpoſe to take us. This was the Ship of thirty two Guns. We being pretty near each other, they gave us a broad-ſide, but we did not mind them; all our care was to get the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-gage. In order to which, while we carried too much Sail, and the Wind blew very freſh, our fore-top Maſt unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came by the board. Immediately we got our Hatchets and cut all clear way, and our Captain ordered the Helm to be clapt a Weather and bore away.

We obſerving that our running had increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Courage, reſolved thereupon to lie by, and fight it out.

The Enemy kept to windward at a good diſtance from us, ſo that we could not come to make uſe of our ſmall Arms; But we divided the two Watches, and one was to manage the great Guns, whilſt the other looked on; and when thoſe at the great Guns were weary, the other were to take their places, till they had refreſh'd themſelves. Thus we fired, I believe, five Guns to his one. We fired about 560, and he about 110 or 115; and we fought him from twelve at Noon to half an hour paſt ſix at Night, although at a good diſtance; for he kept ſo far to windward of us, that our ſhot ſometimes would hardly reach him, tho' his would at the ſame time fly over us. At half an hour paſt ſix, it growing duskiſh, they left off firing, and we did the ſame. We had by good Providence none of our Men either kill'd or wounded by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; only two thro' careleſneſs had their Hands and Faces blaſted; but in a ſmall time they both recovered.

However we found the <hi>Middle Iſlands</hi> to be as convenient as any place could be: And our Captain ſeeming to like this place as well, and knowing we could fortifie our ſelves as ſtrongly here and with as little trouble; we choſe this place: Accordingly on the 18th, it being fair Weather and calm, we towed our Ship in amongſt the Iſlands, and lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Stones caſt of the Shore all round, with one Anchor a Head, and a Cable out at our Stern, which was made faſt to a great Tree on the Shore. As ſoon as we had faſtened our Ship, all Hands went aſhore and began to build Tents for our Cooper and Sail-maker to work in, and to put our Goods and Proviſions in. In the mean time our chief Mate was ſent in the little <hi>Dragon</hi> with twenty Men armed, and two Pattereroes, to cruize in the Gulf; where after he had cruized five or ſix Days, he returned with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Bark of about forty Tuns: She had in her ſome few Jars of Brandy, Wine, and ſome Sugar. They were going to repair her, ſhe being very old; and for that purpoſe had five or ſix Carpenters and Caukers on board, who came very opportunely to help us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair our Ship, for we had great need of Workmen. We took out our Powder, Shot and all our Ammunition; with all our Bread, ſome of our Flower, and our

Then we got all the reſt of our things aſhore, and made every thing ready for cleaning our Ship. Our Men went aſhore often with the Sain, and caught ſtore of Fiſh, eſpecially if they took the right time, which was at the Flood, and better in the Night than in the Day. The 22d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> we ſent our Canoas to an Iſland juſt by us, upon which there were ſeveral old fallen-down Houſes; the Thatch of which we brought away to make uſe of in burning the bottom of our Ship. The bottom of our Ship was in many places eaten like a Honey-Comb; inſomuch that the firm Plank was no thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than an old Six-pence: Nay, in ſome places in the Hold, we could thruſt our Thumbs quite through with eaſe.

               <p>We found here ſeveral ſorts of very good Fiſh, as <hi>Mullets, Breams, Silver-fiſh,</hi> &amp;c.

The Fleſh of them, both ſmells and taſtes ſo ſtrong of Musk, that there is no eating of it.

               <p>The <hi>Pelican,</hi>

They are good Food; only they taſte ſomewhat fiſhy. They have broad Feet like a Duck, being Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowls; but they rooſt commonly on Rocks and in Trees, and always ſet with their Heads to the Wind; ſo that if the Wind changes whilſt they are at rooſt, they turn about their Heads to the Wind.

               <p>The <hi>Guano</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Fig. XIX.</note> is a ſort of Creature, ſome of which are found on Land, ſome in the Water. He is about three foot long, more or leſs; and is a very ugly Creature to look at; having great, ſharp, black and green Scales, from the fore-part of his Head to the end of his Tail; and a ſet of great and ſharp Teeth, with four long Claws upon each Foot. They breed commonly in the Roots of old Trees, near the Water ſide; and frequent the Water as well as Land. When they are ſtewed with a little Spice, they make good Broth; and the Fleſh looks very white, and eats very well; but if they are not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily well boiled, they are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to eat; making Men very ſick, and often putting them into a Feaver, as we were informed by our Priſoners.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Sea-Turtles</hi> there are ſeveral ſorts, but we always account the green Turtle to be the beſt Meat. They have ſeveral I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands and ſandy Bays, where they go to lay their Eggs: Which they do in different places at different times. For in ſome places, as at the Iſland of <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> in the Atlantick Ocean, their common time of laying is in <hi>April, May, June</hi> and <hi>July.</hi> In other places, as in the Bay of <hi>Motines</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> we took them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore

When they want to lay, they go aſhore in ſome ſandy Bay, and with their Fins make a Hole in the Sand about two foot and a half deep, wherein they lay their Eggs, commonly about eighty or ninety at a time: Then they cover them up with the Sand they had ſcraped out of the Hole, and ſo leave them for the heat of the Sun to hatch. Thus they lay two or three times in a Seaſon; and after they have laid, they go off to Sea, and leave the Young, when hatcht, to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; who, as ſoon as they get out of the Shell and Sand, retire to the Water.

               <p>The <hi>Pearl-Oyſter</hi> is much about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our common Oyſter, but more flat and broad. It hangs to the Rocks by a long ſtringy Beard, like a Muſcle. The Pearl lies in the thickeſt part of it; ſome have five, ſix or ſeven Pearls in them. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> make ſeveral Voyages to this Gulf of <hi>Nicoya</hi> and to the Iſland <hi>California</hi> for them. The <hi>Indians</hi> go down in five, ſix, ſeven or eight fathom water, and bring up eight, ten, or twelve Oyſters at a time, while the Men on board open them. The Meat of this Oyſter is very green, and the Oyſter fat. I have eaten of this Oyſter ſeveral times, both boiled and ſtewed; and found them to be tolerable good Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Great Oyſter</hi> grows to the Rocks, as other Oyſters; not hanging to them by a Beard, as the Pearl-Oyſter. When they are opened, one part looks of a fine Red like a Cherry, the other part is of a fine White. I have eat of this ſort of Oyſter many times; but it was for want of better Victuals. They are ſo large, that one of them cut in pieces and ſtewed, is ſufficient for a Meal for five or ſix Men.</p>

In the Year 1534, this Mountain was ſaid to burſt open, and threw Water in ſuch large quantities, that it drowned the City of <hi>Guatimala;</hi> which cauſed the Inhabitants to remove the City three Leagues further off, where it now ſtands.

                  <hi>November</hi> the 11th, in the Even, we ſaw four ſmall White Iſlands, lying cloſe together: On the Eaſt-end of which, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Miles diſtance, is a large Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock, which looks like an Iſland, but is not; the Land going from it to the Main, being very low, cauſes it, till you are very near it, to look like an Iſland. This place is called <hi>Suvartaneo,</hi> inhabited by <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> It lies in the Latitude of 17 d. 40 m. N; and has a ſmall Village, of about forty Houſes, ſtanding by the Sea-ſide. Here we anchored in 14 fathom Water, not above Piſtol-ſhot from the Village. At our coming in, we ſaw about 500 <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> both Horſe and Foot. We fired eight or ten of our great Guns at them, and they retired into the Woods. Then we landed about 30 of us, and went to the Village and romaged it. In it we found a great many ſmall things, with 16 Packs of very good Flower. We filled here two Boats load of Water; but the Sea running high, over-ſet our Boats. Our Men would have ſet the Village on fire, but the Captain being aſhore would not ſuffer them. So on the 18th we went out with the Land-wind, and ſtood away to the Weſtward.</p>

On the back-ſide of the City, is a very pleaſant and fruitful Country.

For this City has the conveniency of Trade both from the North and South Sea: From the North Sea, it receives all or moſt of the <hi>European</hi> Goods which are brought by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to <hi>Portobel</hi> or <hi>Carthagena,</hi> or by any other Nation trading on the North-ſide: And theſe <hi>European</hi> Goods are from hence by ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the South Sea ſent to <hi>Guiaquill, Truxillo, Lima, Arica, Coquimbo, Gova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadore, Valpirizo</hi> and <hi>Valdivia,</hi> with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other noted places; from whence they return back richly laden with the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of theſe Parts.

However the <hi>French</hi> at preſent make very great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Voyages; and now that they find the ſweet of it, they will be ſure, if they can, to ſettle a firm and laſting Trade here. For, as we have been aſſured by ſeveral <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captains whom we took, they have made better than 5000 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of their Goods, one with another. This City ſtood formerly four Miles to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the place where it now ſtands; But it being taken and kept a Month by

It is now much larger, ſtronger and better built, than it was before. The Port of <hi>Perica</hi> is the Harbour for <hi>Panama;</hi> but diſtant from it three Miles. For the great ebbing and ſhoalneſs of the Water, will not ſuffer any great Ship to come any nearer than the ſaid Iſland of <hi>Perica,</hi> which is far out of Command of their Guns at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama:</hi> Therefore ſhipping may eaſily be taken out. But although great Ships are forced to lie here, yet ſmall Veſſels run through a little Creek cloſe up to the City.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Panama</hi> to the Iſland <hi>Tabago,</hi> is between five and ſix Leagues, and they bear nearly North and South from each other. This Iſland of <hi>Tabago,</hi> is in length one league, in breadth about half a league. The Iſland is high and mountainous, but higheſt at the South end. It is very well clothed with Trees of ſeveral ſorts; and on it are ſeveral Walks of <hi>Plantains, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanoes, Coco-nuts,</hi> &amp;c. which they ſend to ſell at <hi>Panama.</hi> Upon this Iſland, on the North-ſide, is a ſmall Village of thatcht Houſes, inhabited by <hi>Negroes,</hi> who are Slaves to the Gentlemen at <hi>Panama,</hi> and are kept here on purpoſe to look after their

Right againſt the ſaid ſmall Village is the common anchoring place, in which there is tolerable good anchoring in ſeventeen or eighteen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom Water. There are two other ſmall Iſlands juſt by it; They are both very well clothed wth Woods; aad on them are ſome few <hi>Negroes,</hi> as there is upon moſt or all of theſe Iſlands in the Bay of <hi>Panama.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the South Eaſt of theſe <hi>Iſlands</hi> is a great range of Iſlands, called the <hi>Kings Iſlands;</hi> they are moſt of them pretty low and pleaſant Iſlands, and very well clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with tall ſtreight Trees of ſeveral ſorts. About them are a great many very good anchoring places; and upon moſt of them is good Wood, Water and Fruit. They are in all about forty in number. On the great Iſland called the <hi>Kings Iſland</hi> (which gives name to all the reſt) the <hi>Spaniards</hi> build good Veſſels, which are commonly counted pretty good Sailers. You muſt obſerve, that amongſt theſe Iſlands you will hardly find much more or leſs than ſixty fathom Water, unleſs you are very near them.

Right againſt this Iſland, on the Main, is a large River called <hi>Cheapo;</hi> and ſeven Leagues up the ſaid River, is a Town of the ſame Name, which is very plentiful of Proviſions.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Chepelio</hi> to the Iſland of <hi>Planta,</hi> is ſeven leagues. It lies a league from the Main, and the water about it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently deep; but near the Main it is all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſhole water, not above four Foot, though you be a league from the ſhore.</p>
               <p>From hence to <hi>Cape Saint Lorenzo,</hi> is ten leagues. This Cape is low Land, full of Creeks; and near it, is ſhole water.

North. The Tide runs here five Knots and a half <hi>per</hi> hour. It riſes and falls three Fathom; and ebbs and flows N. E. and S. W.</p>
               <p>From Point <hi>Garachina</hi> to Port <hi>Pinas,</hi> is ſeven leagues, North and South. The Port of <hi>Pinas</hi> has two ſmall Iſlands at the Mouth of it; But, if you pleaſe, you may ſail cloſe by them; for there is no danger; neither is there leſs than twelve or fourteen Fathom water. At this place is good wooding and watering. The Land is high and very woody, and goes up hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the middle. It is very full of Pine-Trees, and thence called Port <hi>Pinas.</hi> In ſome part of this Port, is good anchoring; and in the Port are three Rivers of freſh water; and the Banks of the Rivers are full of tall ſtreight Trees. The Port lies in the Latitude of 7 d. North. Longitude from <hi>London</hi> Weſt, 82 d. 00 m. And a

The Land here, is not ſo high as at Port <hi>Pinas;</hi> but in many places here are very pleaſant Walks of Coco-nuts. The Coaſt is very deep and dangerous in Winter-time. At the bottom of Port <hi>Quemado,</hi> are two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of freſh water; and at the entrance of the Port, both on the North and South ſide, are ſeveral ſmall Iſlands, or rather Rocks: Keep mid-way between both Points, and you may go in very ſecurely.

               <p>Here therefore we went aſhore at the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland <hi>Conchagua,</hi> to ſeek for water; and after ſome ſearch, we found behind the Hills a large bottom, in which was a large Plantain-walk, and a great deal of Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, that fell from the Mountains. This was very inconvenient for us, becauſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo behind the Hills, we knew we muſt be forced to carry all our water over a high Hill, which we could hardly climb by our ſelves: But ſeeing there was no remedy, we firſt cut down the Buſhes which were in our way, to make us a clear Path; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, the Hill being pretty ſteep on the Land-ſide, towards the bottom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the freſh water; we with our Axes and Shovels cut out ſteps in the Hill: And our Sail-maker having in the mean time made us a Canvas-Pipe of about ninety fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom

The water which we took up was very muddy; and on the top of it grew Duck-weed, as it does uſually in our Ditches. At firſt we raked the Duck-weed away: But our Doctor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading us, that if we took up the weeds, they would mightily preſerve our water; we, according to his advice, took up both weeds and water together. When each Man had filled his ſix Gallon Cask, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it up to the top of the Hill, and then poured it into the Canvas-Pipe, which conveyed it down the Hill into our Cask. Thus we employed our ſelves for four days. And having filled about twenty-five Tuns, which we concluded would laſt lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than our Victuals; and got it on board our Veſſel; the next day, being the 31ſt of <hi>January</hi> 1704/5, we all went aſhore to the Plantain-walk: And having cut down a ſufficient quantity of them, we returned at night on board our Veſſel, intending to ſail next day. This Evening two of our Men who had reſolved to ſtay with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Dampier,</hi> left him and came over to us; ſo that now we were 35 in number, <hi>viz.</hi> thirty-four <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and one little <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro</hi> Boy, whom we had taken from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

For now our Commons was leſſened to half a pound of courſe Flower a Man <hi>per</hi> Day, with two Ounces of Salt-Meat every other Day. Our Veſſel was a ſmall Bark with two Maſts, of about ſeventy Tuns, which we had taken from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> But whilſt we lay here, ſhe was ſo eaten by the Worms, that ſhe begun to grow very leaky; and to add to our Afflictions, we had no Carpenter; neither if any of us ſhould fall ſick, had we any Doctor, or any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to make uſe of; And, which was worſt of all, we had no Boat to aſſiſt our ſelves, if our Veſſel ſhould fail us; for the Doctor, Carpenter and Boat were left with Captain <hi>Dampier.</hi> But truſting to Gods Providence, who had already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us out of ſo many dangers, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on our intended Voyage for <hi>India.</hi>

He has a very large Head, a great Eye, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary good Food. It is very Fleſhy, having no Bone but the Back-bone. Theſe Fiſh, when taken by us, looked very white; but the tips of their Fins and Tail, were yellow; for which reaſon we called them <hi>Yellow-tails.</hi> They were very welcome to us; for whilſt they laſted, which was three days, we ſaved our own Proviſions, feeding upon nothing elſe but this Fiſh.</p>

For we knew the preſent Wind to be only the Land-wind, which we could not think would laſt long. For we did not expect to get into the true Trade, till we had run about ninety or a hundred leagues from the Land. For which reaſon we ſteered away, as I ſaid, S. W. and S. W. by W. Which courſe we held till we came into the Latitude of 10 d. When finding our ſelves in the true Trade, we hauled away VV. N. VV. intending to get into the Latitude of 13 d.

VVe got our ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Sails up by day break every morning, and at Sun-ſet haul'd them down again: For it commonly blew ſo freſh in the Night, that we were forced to ſettle our Top-ſail; and with the riſing of the Sun, the VVind would ſomething abate again:

               <p>For the firſt twenty Days after our Fiſh and Turtle was gone, we fed upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our Plantains, of which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed our ſelves two for a Meal, and two ſuch Meals a day: But after our Plantains were gone, we went to our half pound of Flower a Man <hi>per</hi> day, and our two ounces of Salt Beef or Pork every other day. The Meat had been ſo long in Salt, that when we boiled it, it commonly ſhrunk one half. So we finding a loſs in boiling our Meat, concluded to eat it raw; which we did all the Voyage after, ſo long as it laſted. We now and then caught a Dolphin, and ſometimes ſaw a great many Sea-birds, as Boobies, Noddies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would come and ſettle upon our Veſſel; and happy was he, that could catch one of them.</p>

So we gave him a good Glaſs full, which he immediately drank off; but we thought the Fellow would never ſhut his Mouth again; for he was ſo amazed at the Heat it had left in his Mouth and in his Belly, that I believe he thought he had ſet himſelf on Fire. He laid himſelf down and roared like a Bull; which ſcared moſt of the reſt of them away.

The next Morning, at Day-break, being <hi>May</hi> the 7th, we found our ſelves within a Ships length of a great ledge of Rocks, which ran from 1 Iſland to the other; which we not ſeeing before, and thinking to go between the two Iſlands, had like to have been upon them; But through God's great Mercy, a ſmall breeze of Wind coming from the Shore, we got off, and ſtood to the weſtermoſt Iſland; becauſe we ſaw many Sholes lying off the reſt of them. The Rocks we had like to have been upon, were near the Northermoſt Iſland; which, upon account of our miraculous eſcape, we call'd the Iſland of <hi>Deceit;</hi> it having, to the Eye, diſcover'd no ſuch danger. When we came near the Weſtermoſt Iſland, which was the biggeſt of the three, we ſtood in for the Iſland; and as we drew nearer, about forty or fifty of their flying Proes came off; in which might be about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Men, allowing ten to each Proe: And we could ſee multitudes of people upon the Shore: For as we paſt by any of theſe Iſlands to go to the next, the people alſo followed us. Their flying Proes lay at a diſtance from us, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; till we beckoned and made Signs for them to come to us. Then one of them, which was in the midſt, advanced towards us; and being pretty near, lay

VVe ſtill made Signs for him to draw nearer: Then he came within a Ships length of us, and lay ſtill again. In her were ten Men all naked; and in the midſt of them, a grave chearful old Man, of a pleaſant Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; who had on his Head a four-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered Cap, without a Crown; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he was quite naked, as were all the reſt of them. This Man, by the Reſpect which all the reſt in the Boat ſhowed to him, we gueſſed to be a King or Prince. At their approach to us they ſung a Song, which continued about a quarter of an hour: VVe could not underſtand it, but it was tuned very prettily. VVhen this Song was done, they came almoſt cloſe to our Veſſel's ſide, and then ſung another Song. This was begun by the grave old Man, and followed by all the reſt in the Boat. VVhich done, they put themſelves in the poſture of praying, and made ſeveral Bows and Cringes towards us, after the manner of their Country. Then one of the Men in the Boat, having a very ſore Leg, held it up to us, and pointed to the VVound: By the Signs he made to us, we underſtood that he would have us to cure it; for we being white, and they (I believe) having never ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny white Man before, they ſeem'd as if they did not think us to be mortal Men.

Then they ſhook their Heads, in way of Denial, as I ſuppoſe. But ſeeing us ſtill make towards the Iſland, one of the Men in the Boat blew a Horn; at the ſound of which, all the reſt of the Boats made boldly to us. Upon this, we all believing they would be aboard of us, fired a Musket over them; not deſigning to harm, but only to frighten them: At the noiſe of which they ſeemed wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amazed, and drew back; menacing us at a diſtance with their Paddles, and ſtill following us. So, ſeeing, as I ſaid before, many hundreds of them upon the ſhore; and finding we could have nothing from them, but by force; and having no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors or Cables by which we dare truſt our Bark; and beſides having no Boat to go aſhore in; ſo that ſhould we ſwim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, as ſome of our Men propoſed, yet we could not carry our Arms with us; and the <hi>Indians</hi> might knock us on the Head with Stones, whilſt we were in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; we concluded there was no good to be done here.

So we left the ſaid Iſlands, and called the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt of them <hi>The Iſland of Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> becauſe we made certain account of getting ſome Water here, but could not. They were all three, low, flat, even I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands; full of ſeveral ſorts of Trees, all very green and flouriſhing; And no doubt, if we had had a Boat, we might have met with ſomething which would have been beneficial to our ſelves, and of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our Country: As we might alſo at ſeveral other ſmall Iſlands, which we afterwards paſs'd by. The Inhabitants of moſt of theſe Iſlands, were a very large ſtrong-bon'd People. They had long black ſtreight Hair, which reached down to their middle; and they all go ſtark naked, not ſo much as covering their Privy-parts. I think I never ſaw ſuch a parcel of large ſtout-limb'd Fellows together in my Life.

VVe ſounded ſeveral times, but had no Ground at a hundred Fathom; ſo we ſtill kept on our Courſe, and kept good look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out all night. The next Morning betimes, being <hi>May</hi> the 8th, we ſaw the main Land of <hi>New-Guinea,</hi> bearing South by Weſt, diſtant eighteen or nineteen leagues. And now with a few old broken Boards, which we had in our Veſſel, we went to work to build us a ſmall Boat; which afterwards proved very uſeful to us. The Land was very high and mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. At a diſtance it looked very black; but drawing nearer, it looked more grey. The 9th, we had dirty ſqually uncertain weather, and the VVinds variable all round the Compaſs. VVe kept the Coaſt of <hi>New-Guinea</hi> aboard; and the Land ſtill continued to be of a good height, very full of great high Hills, and ſmall Valleys; which all ſeemed very barren.<note place="margin">See Fig. XXXIII.</note> It is all a rocky Coaſt; neither could we perceive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Harbour, Bay, or place to anchor in.

               <p>From the 8th to the 11th, we had dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Rainy-weather for the moſt part, with uncertain Gales of Wind; and in the Night, it being dark, and we not keeping the Coaſt of <hi>New Guinea</hi> ſo cloſe aboard as we ſhould, we miſſed the common Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and ran paſt it; and in the Morning betimes, found our ſelves amongſt a vaſt number of ſmall Iſlands: When percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving we had over-ſhot the Paſſage, and the Wind being at Eaſt, we concluded to look out for a paſſage to the Southward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe Iſlands. Accordingly we ſtood to the Southward; but found a great many Rocks and Sholes which ſtretched from one Iſland to another: Wherefore at Night, there being little Wind, and not daring to venture further amongſt theſe unfrequented Iſlands and Sholes; we reſolved to lye by all Night: Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the morning, if the Wind ſhould prove Weſterly, to return back again and

This Night we ſaw two or three Fires, which were made on ſhore by the Inhabitants. The Iſlands here were moſt of them of a good height, and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well clothed with ſeveral ſorts of Trees, which all appeared very green and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. This day we put our ſelves to a Pint and half of Water a Man <hi>per</hi> day. On the 12th we had fair weather; with a fine freſh Gale at N. E. So we proceeded to the Weſtward, and at the ſame time had a ſtrong Tide ſetting to the Weſtward. About eight this morning we ſhot in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two high Head-lands, which were diſtant from each other near two Miles. Upon this, ſome of us went to the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt-head, to look if we had a clear Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through; and we ſaw not any let or hindrance: So we got through this place by two in the Afternoon. It was in length about ſeven leagues, and about two Miles broad. In it we could find no Anchor-ground, till within a Ships length of the ſhore; and then we had thirty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom Water. The Land here was of an indifferent height, and very woody. At noon the Tide ſetting back to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and it being calm, we drove by five in the Evening half way back again;

Not long after, a ſtrong Gale ſpringing up again, by ſeven in the Evening we got clear out of this ſtreight the ſecond time; and then it fell calm again: And we drove with the Tide, which then ſet to the Weſtward. In this ſtreight we ſaw a flying Proe under Sail, but it did not come near us. We alſo in ſome of the ſmall Bays ſaw ſeveral old Houſes, ſome ſtanding, and ſome half down; but could not ſee any Inhabitants. On the 13th, we had little wind at E. S. E. and ſometimes calm; but when we had any wind, we ſteered away S. by W. Here we ſaw a great many Iſlands to the Southward of us, but none of them ſo near together but that there vvas room enough to paſs between them, and ſcarce any ground to be found vvith one hundred Fathom of Line.

W, about fifteen Miles; in breadth, about eight; and lyes in the Latitude of about 3 d. 25 m. South; and Weſtward of the Iſland <hi>Bonoa</hi> about 20 Miles. It is a pretty high Iſland, and very well inhabited by <hi>Malayans;</hi> as are all the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands. It is ſhole almoſt all round; which ſholes ſome of them ſtretch a league and a half off the ſhore. Wherefore, unleſs a Man be acquainted or has good Draughts of the place, it is dangerous coming near it. The Iſland is of a good height, but not ſo high as the Iſland <hi>Keylan</hi> before mentioned. On it are ſeveral very good ſprings of freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and on the S. W, ſide of the Iſland, the <hi>Dutch</hi> have a ſmall Fort of ſix Guns. The Island is governed by a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, three Corporals, and a Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunner; and they have under them twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers. On it grow abundance of Cloves and Rice, of which they ſend great quantities to <hi>Amboyna.</hi> The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are moſt of them Fiſher-men.

               <p>From this place we ſtood to the South Weſtward, having the wind at S. S. E And it blowing freſh, we reefed our Top ſails. But when we got clear of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland,

We were now quite out of heart: For we did not expect to fetch <hi>Amboyna;</hi> the S. E.

And we could not think of getting to <hi>Batavia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we had not Victuals to carry us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and beſides, as the wind was, we could not weather the ſholes, which lye to the E. S.

Theſe they commonly preſerve and put up in ſmall Jarrs, of about a quart; of which they tranſport great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities to ſeveral parts of the World. Thoſe which are ripe in <hi>February,</hi> are called the Summer-Clove: Theſe are accounted much better and ſtronger than the former; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe have the beſt part of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to ripen in; whereas the former have not above a Months fair Weather, and all the reſt is rainy and cloudy, ſo that the Rays of the Sun cannot come to them. It is the common receiv'd Opinion, that Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace and Cinamon, grow all upon one Tree; but it is a great miſtake. Theſe Trees commonly bear ſixty, ſeventy, or eighty pound weight at a time; and every ſix Years they are ſure to have a double Crop. There is a vaſt number of theſe Trees upon this Iſland; which are very carefully looked after, and a Regiſter kept of them in the Company's Book. They are numbred once every Year; and beyond a certain number they will not let them encreaſe, but cut them down and deſtroy them for fear of leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Price. All theſe Trees belong to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, or to their Freemen: But thoſe that belong to the Free-men, the Company ſets them an allowance as to

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1705</label> their number: And if any one rears up more than what the Company allows of, he is ſeverely fined, and his Trees forfeited. And whatſoever Cloves, the Trees belonging to Free-men produce, the Freemen are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſell to the Company, after the rate of 6 <hi>d.</hi> a pound. So that properly all the Cloves upon the Iſland are ingroſſed into the Companies Hands; And if any Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or other ſells or conveys away to the value of ten pounds; all that he has in the World is forfeited to the Company, and he to be made a Slave during Life. The Inhabitants uſed formerly to put Cheats upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Sale of their Cloves; for it was common with them to put their Cloves in a large Sheet, which they hung up by its four Corners under the Cieling of their Houſe; and upon the Floor, right under the Cloves, they would ſet a large Tub of freſh Water; which the Cloves, being very dry and of a hot Nature, would by degrees draw up, and make a large addition to their weight, without being eaſily perceived: But now the <hi>Dutch</hi> are grown too cunning for them; For they always try them by giving them a ſmall fillip with their Fore-finger on the Head; and then, if the Clove be throughly ripe, and no Deceit has been uſed, the Head will break all in pieces like a piece of thin brittle Glaſs: But if it has been wetted,

               <p>There are ſome few Nut-megs upon this Iſland; the Trees of which are much like the Peach. But they grow moſtly at the Iſland <hi>Banda:</hi> From whence two or three Ship-loads are exported every Year. The Fruit of this Tree conſiſts of four Parts; the firſt and outward Rind, is like that of a green Wal-nut; the ſecond is dry and thin, which we call Mace; the third is a tough thin Shell, like that of a Cheſnut; and the fourth is the Kernel included in the ſaid Shell, which we call Nut-meg.</p>
               <p>There are ſaid to be upon this Iſland ſome Mines of Gold. One of the <hi>Malayans</hi> ſhowed me ſome of the Ore, which he ſaid was taken out of them: But this he ſaid was a great Crime; and if the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould know it, he ſhould be ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed: For this is an extraordinary Secret, which, as much as they can, they keep from all <hi>Europeans.</hi>

               <p>Although, as I ſaid before, they can raiſe about five hundred and fifty fighting Men upon this Iſland; yet once every Year they are forced to ſpare a great many of their People, which are ſent away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Buſineſſes.

Theſe ſeventy-five Orambies are divided into three Squadrons: The firſt conſiſting of twenty Orambies; which Squadron is always commanded by one of the Council, who carries a yellow Flag: The Rear conſiſts of twenty more, and is commanded by the Fiſcall, who commonly carries a red Flag: The reſt are in the middle Squadron, and attend the Governour, who hath twelve <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers, a Corporal and a Serjeant for his Body-guard, and carries a blew Flag. The Governour carries with him the <hi>Indian</hi> King, and all their Princes, for fear they ſhould rebel in his Abſence. In this Order they go and viſit all theſe Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Iſlands, but eſpecially thoſe that do or would produce Cloves or Nut-megs. And at every Iſland they go to, they have an additional ſtrength. The time of their cruizing in this manner, is commonly ſix Weeks; in which time they cut down, burn and deſtroy all the Clove and Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg Trees they can find, excepting ſuch as

               <p>The <hi>Crockadore</hi> is a Bird of various ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes; ſome being as big as a Hen, and others no bigger than a Pidgeon. They are in all parts exactly of the ſhape of a Parrot. Their Feathers are all over white, excepting only a Bunch upon their Head,

This Bunch of Feathers lies ſo cloſe fitted into a dent in the Head, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perceived, unleſs when the Bird is frighted; and then he ſets it up an end, and it ſpreads open like a Fan. The Fleſh and Legs of this Bird are quite black; and they ſmell very ſweet. When thy fly wild up and down the Woods, they will call <hi>Crockadore, Crockadore;</hi> for which reaſon they go by that name.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſſawaris</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Fig. XXXVI.</note> is about the bigneſs of a large <hi>Virginia</hi> Turkey. His Head is the ſame as a Turkeys; and he has a long ſtiff hairy Beard upon his Breaſt before, like a Turkey. He hath two great Legs, almoſt as thick as a Man's Wriſt; with five great Claws upon each Foot: He has a high round Back; and inſtead of Feathers only long Hairs; and the ſame upon the Pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Wings.

I have ſeen ſeveral of them here embalm'd with Spice, which preſerves them from decay; And ſo embalm'd they are ſent as Rarities to ſeveral parts of the World. It is related of theſe Birds, that when the Nutmegs are ripe, which is in the Months of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> they reſort to the Places where they grow, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Banda</hi> and this place, and eat off the outer-rind of the Nut: After which they fall down dead drunk, and an innumerable Company of Ants gather about them and feed upon them, and kill them.</p>
               <p>Of Fiſh here are alſo ſeveral ſorts; but the moſt noted is the <hi>Sea-Porcupine:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Fig. XXXVII.</note> It is in length about three foot, and two foot and a half round. It has a very large Eye; with two Fins on his Back, and one large one on each ſide near his Gills.

               </p>
               <p>Of Fruits here are Plantains, Bonanoes, Pine-Apples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Pine-Apple grows upon a low ſhrub, with prickly Leaves. They are ſo big, that they will commonly weigh two pound, and two pound and a half. When it is ripe, it is yellow and red without, and full of little Bunches; within it is yellow, and ſo juicy, that when you bite it, the Juice will run down your Chin and Clothes; and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor

Before they eat it, they commonly rub it well with Salt, and ſo let it lye for about an Hour, which takes away the rawneſs of it; then they waſh it in freſh Water, and eat it. But One is ſufficient for two or three People: For they are very apt to cauſe Feavers.</p>
               <p>Here is alſo another ſort of Fruit, called a <hi>Mangoe.</hi> It is about the bigneſs of our common Cucumber. The out-ſide, altho' ripe, looks green; and within, it is very yellow. It is a very delicious Fruit, when ripe; and has a fine fragrant ſmell. When they are green, they cut them in two pieces, which they pickle and ſend to moſt parts of the World. They grow upon a Tree about the bigneſs of our common Apple-tree.</p>
               <p>This Iſland of <hi>Amboyna</hi> is ſandy all round; but the Water is ſo deep, that there is no anchoring near it, but at the <hi>Ley,</hi> (which is at the Weſt-end of the Iſland,) in forty fathom Water cloſe to the ſhore; and in the common Harbour. This Harbour runs up a great way into the Iſland, and almoſt divides it into two Parts, ſo that they are almoſt two Iſlands, being only joined by a ſmall Neck of Land, ſo narrow, that the <hi>Malayans</hi> often haul their Canoas over.

               </p>
               <p>About two Miles further to the North Eaſt, within the Harbour, is the place where formerly our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory was ſettled; and near it is ſaid to be the Hole, into which all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were thrown, after they had been maſſacred by the <hi>Dutch.</hi> There were few of us now here, but expected the ſame Fate; and ſome of the Inhabitants were no way ſhy to tell us, that the Journal which was ſent in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships that we met going out hence for <hi>Batavia,</hi> was our Protection.

               <p>The Iſland <hi>Zalayer</hi> is of a moderate height. It is inhabited by <hi>Malayans,</hi> and planted all round with Coco-nut-trees. The Inhabitants are forced yearly to ſend ſtore of Oil and Match to the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Macaſſer,</hi> as a Tribute.</p>

We could ſee the Ground very plain for about two Miles; and never had above ſix, or under five fathom Water, though it looked as if there was not above two fathom.

And as the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly-wind, being near the <hi>European</hi> ſhore, is the coldeſt; ſo, being near the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> ſhore in the ſame height of Southern
