            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O great and ſo juſt is the Fame and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Sir <hi>Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in Phyſick or Philoſophy
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0538300300:3"/>ſuffices to recommend it to the World, without the Neceſſity of ſuperadding Arguments, Reaſons, or Experiments, to give it more Credit or Authority: But we have alſo the concurring Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of another Perſon, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for ſolid Erudition, Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the <hi>Facultas Medica,</hi> or College of Phyſicians. It was in <hi>your Preſence,</hi> Sirs, and not <hi>in yours alone,</hi> but together with ſeveral Fellows of both theſe illuſtrious Societies, before whom the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters were brought, and have been examin'd by ſeveral Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and were taſted, and by <hi>You</hi> were highly commended for their Strength and grateful Taſte, and promiſing Vertue, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That they did much exceed the <hi>Spa</hi> Waters, with which they were compar'd.</p>
            <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0538300300:4"/>
            <p>Upon this Approbation of <hi>Yours,</hi> together with my own Experience of the good theſe Waters had done to my ſelf, and alſo to ſeveral of my Friends of late and formerly, I thought I had Reaſon enough to undertake this Province, of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this Account of <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of this Tract is not to depreciate or undervalue the <hi>Spa</hi> Waters; for they have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs been of conſiderable Benefit to Mankind, and will, I hope, continue to do much good; but yet ſince a kind Providence opens a richer or more ſalubrious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Waters, ſhall we not thankfully embrace this Gift of God? The <hi>Spa</hi> Waters have had a great Advantage above theſe,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0538300300:5"/>they have been longer and more apply'd to than other Waters of that Kind. Much perhaps may be due to the happy Scituation, and good Accommodation of the Place, which invited and caus'd a more copious and numerous Reſort of rich and populous Neighbouring Nations, ſuch as <hi>Flanders, Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> The <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters lie more North, have been moſt frequented by the <hi>Northern</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Germany;</hi> and of late Years Perſons of the higheſt Birth and Quality, even Princes of the Illuſtrious Houſes of <hi>Hanover</hi> and of <hi>Saxony,</hi> have graced theſe Waters with their Preſence, and have diſcern'd their Vertue and good Effects, and have given them a greater Fame than formerly: But <hi>England,</hi> which has been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as to have known no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0538300300:6"/>of them hitherto, is now like to be ſupply'd by wiſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods taken to furniſh this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with conſiderable Quantity, of theſe Waters, at whoſe Arrival (which is daily expected) their own Vertue will ſuffice to give them Reputation.</p>
            <p>But that I may crown, and give the finiſhing Stroke to this Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters, we have the Experience and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Gracious Sovereign, a Wiſe and Judicious Prince, who has choſen and preferr'd theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of that vaſt Variety of Steel Waters which <hi>Germany</hi> abounds with. You have a lively Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Atteſtation of the Health-preſerving Vertue of theſe Waters, viſible in his Majeſty's healthful Countenance, who not only the
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0538300300:7"/>laſt Year, but in many preceding Years, drank theſe cordial and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimating Waters. Nor will it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe a Prince endow'd with ſo much Bounty and Benevolence, to have been a happy Occaſion of recommending this ſalutiferous Fountain, or Source of Water, to his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects. It was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent made by one of his Majeſty's Family, which enabled me to make the ſeveral Tryals and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mention'd in this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. But amongſt the reſt, that which gave me the greateſt Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Comfort was this, That they could be brought in ſo great a Perfection, as to contain and carry their Virtue entirely good to us, perhaps, with leſs Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than a Bottle of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> or old <hi>Rheniſh</hi> do bring theirs. And may our moſt Clement and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING procured a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters, I made ſome Trials with them, both internal and external, by Drinking them, and by other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments which are here related. By the Taſt I manifeſtly diſcovered that they contain'd a rich Chalybeat In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, far exceeding that of the beſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0538300300:16"/>
               <hi>Spa</hi> Water I ever taſted: The <hi>Spa</hi> Waters have juſtly the Preference, not only to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Steel Waters, but to all the Foreign Waters that are brought over, which made me compare theſe with the <hi>Spa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spa</hi> Waters are then looked upon to be moſt excellent, when they ſparkle in the Glaſs, and give a brisk Taſt to the Palate. The <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters gave this Proof of their Briskneſs, as ſoon as the Cork was opened, and the Air was admitted, did make a notable Ebullition, like bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Cyder, and gave a ſmart, ſpirituous, and pleaſant Taſt, and continued the brisk and high chalybeat Reliſh to the laſt Glaſs, tho' we were ſome Hours about the drinking off a Bottle of Two Quarts.</p>
            <p>In Reference to the internal Uſe of theſe Waters, I proſecuted the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Method: I got ſome excellent good <hi>Spa</hi> Waters, I drank them for 6 or 7 Days, a Flask at a Time; I then drank the ſame Quantity of <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Water for 4 Days, and afterwards continued the Uſe of both theſe Waters alternately, until I had drank about 20 Days: The Reſult of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0538300300:17"/>was ſo plain and manifeſt to me, that the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters gave me more Spirit and Strength thoſe Days I drank them, than when I us'd the others; and I have good Reaſon to hope, that many Perſons will confirm this Experience of mine, when they ſhall be ſo happy as to obtain theſe Waters.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Water is by the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Phyſicians reckoned amongſt the <hi>Acidulae,</hi> or ſour Wells or Waters; I take the more Notice of this, becauſe I gave a Glaſs of it to more than one of my Friends, who were ſurprized at the Quickneſs of the Taſt, and called it ſharp or <hi>acid;</hi> but when I made them drink another Glaſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it better, they were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and confeſs that the ſmart and brisk Taſt had miſled them to call it acid or ſour. Thus Cyder and ſoft Ale when bottled, may give a ſmart and acute Impreſſion to the Palate, tho' very far from being ſour; and even Spirits, or volatile Alkalies of <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac</hi> or of <hi>Hartſhorn,</hi> when mixt with Water, do cauſe a ſmart and pungent Affection on the Tongue; which is far from being <hi>acid.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0538300300:18"/>
            <p>But to bring this to a yet further Trial, whether an <hi>Acidity</hi> was preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or ſo much as to be found in theſe Waters, we dropt a good Proportion of Spirit of <hi>Hartſhorn</hi> and Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> into theſe Waters, and did not find the leaſt Luctation or Motion appear, as they uſually do with an <hi>acid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I made a yet more critical and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Examen of the <hi>Acidity</hi> ſaid to be found in <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters, by mixing them with Milk in various Meaſures and Proportions, and I alſo gave vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Degrees of Heat to them, ſome were tried in a tepid or lukewarm, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a boyling Heat, but did not curdle the Milk at all; on the contrary, the Waters preſerved the Milk for 4 or 5 Days from curdling, or being ſour; which ſtrong <hi>Alkalies</hi> will do in like Manner. Theſe Experiments do ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prove, that our <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters do not contain an <hi>acid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I often made theſe following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove the chalybeat Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Vertues of theſe Waters in my own private Room, and ſhewed them to ſome Friends: According to the common way of trying chalybeat Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0538300300:19"/>I put a ſmall Quantity of pouder'd Gall, about half a Grain or leſs, to half a Pint of <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Water, and ſtirr'd it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſo as to make a ſudden Mixture, and it did in a Moment give a deep Purple Colour; but if you drop the Powder gently on the Surface of the Water, it will make a very fine Blue Tincture, more pleaſant to the Spectator, but far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo curious as the following Tincture.</p>
            <p>We took 4 or 5 Leaves of ſtrong Green Tea, placed them in the Bottom of a Glaſs, holding a quarter of a Pint, and pouring on the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Water, and ſtirred it not at all, we obſerved theſe Leaves to unfold themſelves, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually tinge theſe Waters with a fine caeruleous azure Blue, few Vegetables do afford the like: Note, that if theſe, or any other Stipticks, (which are the Praecipitators) do continue long in the Water, they give a deeper Purple, and even at length an <hi>Atramentarius</hi> Colour.</p>
            <p>There is another Property in theſe Waters, which makes them more uſeful to us than any Foreign Chalybeat Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters we yet know, that is, they do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry better, and keep their Vertue long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, are not ſo ſoon ſpoil'd by any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Inſinuations of the Air, as <hi>Spa,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0538300300:20"/>and other Iron or Chalybeat Waters are apt to be. The Mineral is here tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly well united and mixt with this Water, ſo that it does not eaſily precipitate, or ſeparate from the Water; it carries alſo a much greater Quantity of the Steel, or (as ſome call it) Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Quality in it; and for theſe Reaſons does the better paſs the <hi>Vaſa Lactea,</hi> and communicate with the Blood it ſelf, and work the more conſiderable Effects.</p>
            <p>That theſe <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters do hold their Vertue beyond any other we know of, appear'd to me, becauſe there was not one of thoſe I open'd, (ſome of which were kept the whole Winter,) that diminiſhed any Thing of the ſtrong Iron or Steel Taſt. Moreover, I made this Experiment; I ſuffered a Bottle, or Flask of <hi>Spa</hi> Waters, being about half full, to be unſtopp'd, and expoſed to the Air for 12 Hours; I examined it, and it did neither tinge nor taſt of the Mineral, but was inſipid; but the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters, expoſed juſt after the ſame Manner, did taſt ſtrong of the Mineral, nay, they continued to do ſo, and to give the Tincture to Galls for 2 Days, and perhaps might have done ſo longer, but I thought that ſuffic'd.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0538300300:21"/>
            <p>In Order to the making good, or prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what has been aſſerted in the Account of the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters, Theſe Experiments were made at a full Meeting of the Fellows of the Royal Society, <hi>February</hi> the 28th, 17 16/17. Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> Preſident, being in the Chair.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT I might the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the worthy Members of the Royal Society, of the promiſing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and Vertues of theſe Waters, (for very few had ever taſted them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,) I brought a Bottle full of <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> Waters that held above Two Quarts, which I had kept ſince <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt; The Weather being very cold, I placed the Bottle ſo near the Fire, as to give it a little Warmth, or to damask it, as they do to Wine; The Bottle being open'd, the Water immediately made a viſible Ebullition, but not ſo much as it did in Summer, and being poured out, did ſparkle in the Glaſs: I preſented a Glaſs of it to the Preſident, he ſaid it was highly Chalybeat, and of a brisk and grateful Taſt. Moſt, if not all the Gentlemen preſent, taſted the Waters,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0538300300:22"/>did all agree with the Preſident, That they were a ſtrong Chalybeat, or Steel Water, and of a pleaſant Taſt; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, Doctor <hi>Douglas,</hi> a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Phyſician, declared, that his Glaſs of Water (which was a good large one) did give a very kind and comfortable Warmth to his Stomach, which made him infer, that it would prove of great Uſe, and be a notable Stomachick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. I often found it to affect my Stomach, much as it did his; but he proves a better Judge, becauſe he has avoided drinking Wine for many Years paſt. This being done,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I opened a Flask of the beſt <hi>Spa</hi> Waters I could get, which being pour'd into the Glaſs, was preſented alſo to the Preſident, but had a very ſmall and low Taſt of the Chalybeat, (and was judged ſo not only by him, but the reſt who taſted it) when compared with the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I alſo demonſtrated in their Preſence the Experiments abovementioned, by putting 4 or 5 Leaves of Tea to a Glaſs of theſe Waters, and about half a Grain of Galls to another, which preſented them with a curious Blue or Purple
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0538300300:23"/>Colour; that with Tea exceeded in Beauty the other.</p>
            <p>In Reference to the Experiment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned, as to the way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving theſe Waters, it is now perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to more Advantage after this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: I fill'd a Pint Bottle of <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters out of my great Bottle, which being well ſtopp'd, was put into the Cuſtody of the Curator, who brought it forth the next Meeting, being full 7 Days, and then was found to hold a ſtrong Chalybeat Taſt, and did tinge with Galls. It will prove a hard Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make the <hi>Spa</hi> Water hold 7 Hours after this way of Management; So that on this Account theſe Waters have ſome conſiderable Advantage, becauſe many Perſons cannot drink above half a Flask at a Time of the <hi>Spa</hi> Water, by the next Morning the Remainder does loſe all its Vertue, and will taſt much like common Water.</p>

            <p>At the reading my firſt Account which I gave of the Vertue of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> Waters, it was diſcourſed and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that they contain'd a purging
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0538300300:25"/>Quality in them, which is not only aſſerted by Authors, but even by thoſe that have actually drank them, who have poſitively aſſur'd me, that they did purge them. For my Part, I much queſtioned this general Effect of any Chalybeat Water, and ſo ſoon as I drank them my ſelf, I found th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, which was more agreeable to the ſeveral Sorts of Steel Waters, whoſe Nature and Properties I have examin'd, and are Printed by Sir <hi>Hans Sloan,</hi> in, the Tranſactions. See<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vol.</hi> 28. p. 247</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now to bring this to a fair Trial, whether any purging Ingredient can be found in theſe Waters, I made this Experiment.</p>
            <p>I evaporated a Quart of theſe Waters <hi>ad ſiccitatem,</hi> and then poured upon this Remainder ſome Rain Water, enough to diſſolve and take up the Salts; and then having filter'd this Solution, I then by a moderate Heat exhal'd the Water, which contain'd about 4 Grains of a brackiſh Salt, more like Sea Salt, than that of the purging Waters. We may ſafely conclude, that ſo ſmall a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0538300300:26"/>of Salt in a Quart of Water, can by no Means be imagined to cauſe the leaſt Purgation, no not in an Infant; For ſince we have ſeparated the Salts out of the Purging Waters, and brought them into common Practice, we do find by Experience, that 2 Drams, or 120 Grains, diſſolved in a Quart of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, purges very little; and that a whole Ounce of the true genuine Salts, is but a uſual Doſe.</p>
            <p>I have made it more than probable, in a former Examen of Steel Waters;<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </gap> for</hi> 1713. p. 249.</note> That Chalybeat Waters do contain ſtiptic and reſtringent Qualities in them, and that they are derived from Iron Minerals, and more particularly the Pyrites, which Doctor <hi>Liſter</hi> ſuggeſts, (not without Reaſon) to be the Parent of all Iron Oar. I have often examin'd at <hi>Deptford</hi> the Solution of the Pyrites by Rain Water, out of which Copperas or Vitriol is made, and found it to be a very ſtrong Chalybeat Water: From this Mineral of Iron we have our ſtrong ſtiptic Powders and Waters to ſtop Bleedings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for external and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0538300300:27"/>Uſe. A judicious Uſe of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> and <hi>Spa</hi> Waters hath cured obſtinate and inveterate Diarraeas, which did not yield to the Force of all other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding our arguing to the contrary, it will De retorted upon us, that there is Matter of Fact and Experience againſt us, <hi>that they really do purge at</hi> Pyrmont, where they are drank: This Effect I ſoon conjectured to be due to ſome irregular, or immoderate Uſe of theſe Waters; for I found above Thirty Years paſt, the ſame Effect at <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> on thoſe that drank the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haſtily and in profuſe Quantities; they cauſed Giddineſs, Sickneſs, Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Purgings; but ſince our Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have corrected theſe Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, we hear of no ſuch Complaint; for all agree that theſe Waters are bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and oft require opening Medicines. Now I am well informed at <hi>Pyrmont,</hi> that they are ordered to drink large Quantities, oft three or four Quarts or more of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meaſure, and that pretty haſtily; which makes it no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that their Weight preſſes and forces them thorough the Bowels, becauſe a much leſs Quantity of Rain, Pump, or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0538300300:28"/>Spring Water, do purge of themſelves, as I have experienced in my ſelf a few Days paſt for the Cure of a <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> two Quarts being drank haſtily gave me about ſix Dejections; whereas if you drink theſe or any Chalybeat Waters leiſurely, and in juſt Quantities, they will paſs off as they ſhould, by Urine only. And herein lies the Intention and great Uſe of theſe altering Waters, which is to temper and meliorate the State of the Blood, for they ought to prove a Cordial, and give Strength to the weak and depreſſed Spirits; but if they chance to purge, the Patient will ſoon complain that he loſes Ground, and muſt uſe Means to check any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arraea, and to make the Waters go the right way by Urine, which he then finds will do him good, and produce the deſired Effect.</p>
            <p>I am informed by a learned Phyſician, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Archiater to our Sovereign, That it ſeemed ſtrange to ſeveral of the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Water Drinkers of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance at Court, that any one ſhould doubt of the purging Quality of thoſe Waters: I have my ſelf alſo been told by more than one Phyſician, that have been there upon the Place,

               </gap>f our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Springs. The laſt named Dr. <hi>Grew,</hi> an ancient and early Fellow
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0538300300:30"/>of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> has uſhered this Medicine into the World, by bringing it into a dry Salt; and recommending it into the <hi>Materia Media,</hi> which is now of great Uſe to Mankind, is carried into remote Countries, even to the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> is the cheapeſt and moſt general Purge of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This premis'd, I have hinted above, that a Quart of <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Water has very little real Salt of any Kind, not enough to purge a Sparrow, and has little or none at all of the Purging Cathartick Salt to be found in it, ſo that it cannot purge, no, not even when drawn freſh out of the Well, and drank rationally, that is, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately: Nor is the Argument of any Validity, that it loſes its purging Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty by Carriage; becauſe the purging Salt is a fixt Salt, and will carry as far as the <hi>Indies,</hi> as well as Salt Petre, or our common Kitchin Salt will do; nay, will carry all the World over, and loſe nothing of its Vertue, though it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to -the open Air, or diſſolv'd in Water, being dried up it recovers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>If I may be any tolerable Judge my ſelf, who am eaſily wrought upon by any Lenitives, I do vouch, that the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0538300300:31"/>
               <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters have no laxative Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at all on me. The ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have from a learned Divine, who aſſur'd me, that he found no purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quality in the Uſe of them; We both drank them the laſt Year. I do farther venture to prognoſtick, (and to my great Satisfaction of their greater Vertue) That they will not purge them who ſhall drink a Flask of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, containing the Quantity of a <hi>Spa</hi> Flask; nay, I may venture to ſay, two of thoſe Flasks, if not drank haſtily, nor with too much Motion.</p>
            <p>Since I am upon the Topick of Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and we are mighty apt amongſt us, I mean the Ignorant, to talk much of carrying off ſome Reliques of Diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, perhaps of Fevers; which, I fear, are oft done precipitantly, and do bring on Relapſes. This brings to my Mind the Practice at <hi>Tunbridge</hi> for about 40 Years paſt, when I frequented thoſe Waters, That they did not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Patient by Purges, for his Courſe of Drinking, which was very convenient, but they did give ſtrong Purges at the Concluſion of their Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That ſagacious and conſidering Phyſician, Dr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> (in whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0538300300:32"/>I had ſome Intereſt) charg'd me to have a Care of being miſled into that Errour; aſſuring me, That this Practice would deſtroy and carry off all the Strength and Vertue the Patient gain'd in a Month's Drinking. He gave me a parallel Inſtance in the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, which ſuſtain'd the ſame Damage by Purging, and it is diſallowed of every where by the Skilful; and yet we have in both theſe Caſes, ſome very ignorant, but confident Pretenders to Phyſick, who aver, That the Bark, as well as Steel Waters, do leave behind them malignant and dangerous Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if not carried off by Purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: Which Practice is generally laid aſide by the Learned Phyſicians in <hi>England,</hi> and I hope in other Countries.</p>
            <p>There is one Method alſo has been made Uſe of at <hi>Pyrmont,</hi> and other of the Mineral Waters, which to me ſeems erroneous and dangerous, and ought to be conſider'd and examin'd, whether it does not cauſe ſome very bad Effects, and that is, as I am told, the Phyſicians do order their Patients, with their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies full of Water, to walk up and down haſtily, and to beſtir themſelves very nimbly: And I am alſo told from very
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0538300300:33"/>good Authority, That it is common to forbid ſuch the Uſe of the Waters, who through Lameneſs, or other Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are diſabled from Action or nimble Motion: But in <hi>England</hi> we often find the contrary Method neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, eſpecially in tender and infirm Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, in whom the Operations of Medicines are moſt conſpicuous and diſtinguiſh'd, for theſe do feel the good Effects of being very ſtill and ſedate, of being quiet both in Body and Mind: Of this the late Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Inſtance, who could never drink <hi>Tunbridge, Bath,</hi> or any other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uretick Waters, but in her Bed; which has been the Caſe of many others of my own Friends, with whom they would not agree, nor paſs off, if they walk'd with them, or took them in any other Poſture than lying. I am far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing this Way promiſcuouſly, and to all Sorts of People, doubtleſs mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate walking may agree with many; I have known where riding, after the Waters have been pretty well gone off, has done no Harm; but I found in my ſelf, when young and ſtrong, very ill Effects in Riding too ſoon after I had drank a Quantity of Mineral Waters,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0538300300:34"/>that my Legs ſwell'd, and an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> attended that Swelling.</p>
            <p>An Anatomiſt, who well conſiders, that the Waters muſt circulate through the Heart with the Blood, and from thence up and down through an Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of aſcending as well as deſcending Windings and Turnings, he will ſay, that the upright or erect Poſture will appear leſs likely to facilitate the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood, now loaded with Water, than the Horizontal Poſture of lying on a Couch or a Bed does: Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it ſelf confirms the Truth of this, not only of my own, but of many other Water-Drinkers, of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> as well as of the <hi>Bath,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe Waters have not paſs'd to any Degree in the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, but theſe have gone off very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully at Night in their Beds. I have for many Years paſt recommended a large Glaſs of <hi>Bath</hi> Waters to my Friends, to be conſtantly taken in their Beds every Night; for which Draught I have had the Thanks of many, but never heard of any Harm received.</p>
            <p>As a farther Argument againſt much Morion, when we drink the Chalybeat Waters, (eſpecially ſince they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally us'd in hot Weather) we muſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0538300300:35"/>avoid all Methods that provoke Sweat, or diſpoſe us to a quick Perſpiration through the cutaneous Glands, which we plainly feel and obſerve to be cauſed by much Agitation or Walking, and by that Means the Current of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is diverted from its natural and proper Channel, and hinder'd from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by Urine, which ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>
            <p>I now appeal to the Judgment of the moſt wiſe and learned Perſons of this Honourable Society, who have been the Authors of ſo much Good to Mankind; whether theſe Arguments for regulating the Uſe of theſe noble medical Waters, have not ſome Weight, and may not deſerve to be conſider'd, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd untry'd: This I am ſure, that this Method is no wiſe hazardous to the Lives of Men; whereas the great Weight and Load of Water in the Blood, (for all Perſons cannot throw them off <hi>per Sedem</hi>) muſt needs produce ſome ill Effects. The great Quantity may too much extend and ſpoil the Stomach, may cauſe Diſeaſes of the Head, Vertigo's, Apoplexies, break down the Lymphaeducts, and make an <hi>Aſcitis,</hi> the worſt of Dropſies; and cauſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0538300300:36"/>thoſe very Diſeaſes, which a moderate Uſe would certainly cure.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be looked upon as an Omiſſion, for having taken no mow Notice of the fixed Parts, or of the Ingredients which are to be found in all Chalybeat Waters, and therefore in the <hi>Pyrmont.</hi> For I mention only a ſmall Quantity of Water evaporated <hi>ad ſiccitatem,</hi> and I have made Uſe only of the watry Element to diſſolve the Salts, and examine their Figure and Taſt, that I might reduce them to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Species of Salts. As to the Salts, I never fail'd of a <hi>Sal Marine,</hi> but found it in all Sorts of Mineral Waters, (tho' in ſome in very ſmall Quantity,) which is not to be wondred at, ſince 'tis very probable, that our Fountains and Wells may owe their Original to the Sea; and ſo may not altogether ſtrain off all, and clear themſelves, by Tranſcola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the Earth, of every ſaline Particle. Moreover, the Earth it ſelf does not only furniſh whole Hills or Rocks of Salt, but has ſmaller Veins, and even Grains of Salt ſcatter'd up and down, which are again abſorb'd by ſmall Rivulets, or Currents of Water, and do in more or leſs Quantity impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0538300300:37"/>ſtagnating Wells, or flowing Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
            <p>I have indeed formerly examin'd the Remains or fixt Parts of many of our ferruginous Waters; I have generally found them much the ſame, for all of them do contain Iron Particles; but thoſe that abounded moſt with Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, held a crude groſs Ocre, and would give the deepeſt and blackeſt Tincture to the Water, and had the leaſt Vertue in them. The Chymiſt having collected a good deal of this Subſtance, makes it paſs through many a fiery Trial by Calcination, Reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at length he brings forth a Powder of a Reddiſh or deep Yellow, and ſhall adorn it with a fine Name, perhaps he will call it a <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> or a Saffron of Steel; (this Name he borrows from one of our moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Vegetables, <hi>Saffron,</hi>) or elſe his Fancy ſhall run upon another Notion, and ſhall call it a <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Mars;</hi> and not reſt here, but endeavour to make up the Three Chymical Principles, namely, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury; he will call it Sulphur, though it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combuſtible; it muſt be a Salt, though it be undiſſolvable; and a Mercury,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0538300300:38"/>although it look like a Gravel Stone. To what Purpoſe all this Labour and Pains? whereas,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The very Taſt tells us, that the <hi>Spa</hi> Waters are impregnated with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat or Iron Particles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Eyes will tell us, that we may ſee Iron in theſe Waters to a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; if you put a little Powder or Solution of Galls to theſe Waters, it gives a black Colour, and will make Ink. Now ſince we have in <hi>England</hi> not any one Thing that gives a black Colour, or is dyed black, but what comes from Iron; none will doubt at firſt Sight of this Experiment, whether the Waters do belong to the Iron Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal or no. In <hi>England</hi> we abound much with the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> or Copperas Stone, out of this we make great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of this Copperas, which is almoſt all Iron. The Dyers make Uſe of it to give the black to Woollen, Linen, Silks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by boiling it in Water with Galls, and without it we can't give a good black to one Yard of Cloth.</p>
            <p>To me theſe two eaſy and ſenſible Experiments, made with little Coſt and Trouble, do as plainly exhibit the Iron Quality, as if I had evaporated ſome
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0538300300:39"/>Gallons of theſe Waters, and had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Recrements through Chymical Fires, and had with a Loadſtone (as I have done formerly in the like Caſe) taken up the very Subſtance of Iron.</p>
            <p>But after all theſe pompous and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Experiments, by which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to examine and analize theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Waters, we muſt return to the Waters themſelves, whoſe Vertue lies in their <hi>Syntheſi,</hi> or natural Conſtitution in the Form of Waters: As ſuch, let us endeavour to make them as uſeful as poſſible; for without all doubt, they do contain Medicines adapted to the Cure of many Diſeaſes, which will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed more effectually, if the Phyſicians, eſpecially he that practiſes at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Head, do abound in Piety and Charity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let him not diſparage the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Author of this great Medicine, for its not being made by the Hands of proud or weak Man: Let him not ſay, as ſome Wretches have done, that theſe Waters are only a good Vehicle for his own wiſer and better Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but rather let him aſcribe to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0538300300:40"/>great Founder of theſe noble Medicines, the due Tribute of Thanks and Praiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let his Charity be expreſſed to his Neighbour, by applying theſe Waters with the utmoſt Care and Skill he can, by giving them after a due Manner, in juſt Proportion and Quantity, and not pour into the Stomach whole Deluges of Water, to break down Nature's Boundaries; but ſetting aſide all Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Self-Ends, let him regard what Symptoms they beſt relieve, and what ſtubborn Diſeaſes they moſt effectually cure. Let him not, from a vain and ambitious Conceit, pretend to improve theſe Waters, by adding ſome Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Drops or Fancies of his own; for theſe often give a nauſeous Taſt to the grateful Waters, and may not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the Drinker of his pleaſant Draught, but alſo of the ſuperiour Vertue inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Waters themſelves. This Method is too much practis'd amongſt us, and often injuriouſly, and deſerves to be cenſured.</p>

            <head>A Liſt of ſome of thoſe Diſeaſes, which Chalybeat Waters are preſcrib'd to cure.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THEY are a proper Remedy for moſt Diſeaſes of the Stomach, as Want of Appetite, or Defects of Digeſtion from Weakneſs or Relaxation of the Fibres of the Stomach; alſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine and exceſſive Appetites, ſour and bitter Vomitings, Heart-burning, or <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> and many other Stomach Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſeaſes of the Bowels, ſuch as painful and griping Colicks proceeding from corroſive or fretting Salts, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bilious, or other glandulous Juices of the Bowels; theſe are diluted, alter'd, or ſweetned by the Chalybeat Virtue of theſe healing Waters; and the Chyle it ſelf is better prepar'd and elaborated in the Region of the Bowels, and being freed from diſtemper'd Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, is convey'd into the Blood, better adapted for Sanguification. In Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriack Diſeaſes, where pent up Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and flatulent Humours rack and lacerate the tender Fibres and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0538300300:42"/>of the Stomach and Bowels, theſe ſalutiferous Waters are eſteem'd ſpecifick.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their Vertue is not confin'd to thoſe Parts called the <hi>primae viae,</hi> or firſt <hi>apparatus</hi> of the Chyle, but extends farther, even penetrates the Maſs of Blood, and is of manifeſt Uſe to cure the Jaundice, and even Dropſies, (if not too far gone.) It dilutes and waſhes the Scorbutick Salts out of the Blood, and at the ſame time waſhes off the Gravel, and ſmaller Stones collected in the Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder, and prevents their Concretions in thoſe Parts again. By them the latent Seeds of many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes fixt in the Organisk Parts, ſuch as the moſt ſagacious Phyſician cannot perceive, are carried off, or obliterated in their Original. Sickly and ſqualid Countenances, viſible Indications of a deprav'd State of Health, ſhall, after a convenient Uſe of theſe Waters, look healthful and ſanguine: By theſe the very Texture of the Blood is mended, drooping Spirits are cheer'd, exhilirated, and enabled to do the various Offices of Nature more ſtrenuouſly, and they affect our Spirits with a much more

            </p>
            <p>I have now given a ſhort Hint only of ſome few of thoſe Diſeaſes for which theſe Waters are proper; Time would fail me to enumerate them all.</p>
            <p>This gives a great Reputation unto the Excellency of theſe Waters, that when Phyſicians have in vain applied their own Preparations to obtain a Cure, they are forced to fly to theſe Divine Remedies, and do very often find their Account here.</p>
            <p>Since it is agreed, by the general Conſent and Experience of Nations, to aſcribe extraordinary Vertues to theſe Sorts of Fountains that are impregnated with Chalybeat Particles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are called Steel Waters; I hope I have done <hi>this my Native Country,</hi> not only a Piece of Juſtice, but an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Service, in theſe my Endeavours to recommend to them theſe particular Waters of <hi>Pyrmont,</hi> eſpecially ſince it appears, that they do in many Degrees
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0538300300:44"/>ſurpaſs any of our own Waters, in their Medicinal Properties, or any others that are brought to us from Foreign Parts.</p>
            <p>There are ſome particular Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Privileged which belong to this Chalybeat Fountain, for this Spring abounds with a vaſt Quantity of Water, it is more portable, carries, and holds its Vertue better than any other; I have kept it a Summer and Winter without Decay; it is ſcituated as near the Sea Side as any Foreign Water, and requires leſs Land Carriage; and, I doubt not in Time, ſo ſoon as a Trade is ſettled, it will be brought over much cheaper than any Sort of Foreign Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Abroad.</p>
            <p>It can be no Objection to me againſt theſe <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters, which I find ſome have complain'd of beyond the Sea, that theſe are too heavy and too ſtrong of the Mineral. I do allow them to contain a very great Proportion of that Ingredient in them, as a Proof of their Excellency; for the Mineral here is not a groſs and heavy Ocre, but finely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and exalted; a Vitriol (not to be match'd by humane Art) well diſſolv'd in its watry Vehicle. For Want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0538300300:46"/>of a Strength ſuperiour to any in Uſe amongſt us, which I hope, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, will rejoice the Hearts, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the drooping Spirits of many a ſad and hypocondriack Soul; for whom moſt of our Chalybeats are found too weak.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrong Argument that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat Waters, particularly the <hi>Spa,</hi> have given great Satisfaction, and done much good, becauſe they have been much more preſcrib'd and us'd amongſt us of late Years than formerly; and they would ſtill be in greater Vogue if they were not adulterated, or if the true Waters from the <hi>Spa</hi> could be brought to us in Perfection with their original Strength, which (I am ſorry to ſay) can rarely be brought to paſs. On the other Hand, thoſe of <hi>Pyrmont,</hi> with but a very moderate Care in ſtopping, can ſcarce fail of being delivered to us in their full Strength. I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that Experience will ſoon evince and demonſtrate the Truth of this Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>It is another Misfortune, that the Chalybeat Fountains of Water, ſuch as <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> &amp;c. can be only applied to in the warm Weather, for four or five
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0538300300:47"/>Months in the Year; but ſince theſe Waters, (which were brought before the <hi>Royal Society</hi> in Winter) after they were a little warm'd by the Fire, did then give very good Proof of their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vertue, we may hence be ſecur'd of their being like to be brought into Uſe, even in the ſevereſt Winters.</p>
            <p>I cannot paſs by a Propoſition of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovenamed Learned Phyſician, Dr. <hi>Stei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerthall,</hi> my worthy Friend, who, in a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tract of his, gives an Account of great Variety of Waters in <hi>Germany</hi> and other Places, and particularly mentions this, That at <hi>Swalbach,</hi> when the Weather is cold, they bring the Waters to the Fire, and warm them before they drink them: He propoſes the making theſe Waters warm by an ignited Rod or Gad of Iron; the Doctor confeſſes with great Modeſty that he never made the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, but to me it ſeems ſo ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that it ought to be taken Notice of; and that it may be made practical, give me leave to add theſe Directions. Take a ſmall Bar or Rod of Iron, about a Foot long, fit a wooden Handle to one End, to be put on or off at Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, pour off half a Pint of Water out of the Flask, into a convenient Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0538300300:48"/>of Silver or China, not of Glaſs, plunge the ignited Iron into the Water, bring the Water to a very low Degree of Heat; when you pour off more out of the Flask, get your Heaters always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. In this Experiment you loſe none of the Chalybeat Vertue of the Waters, but rather receive an Addition from the heated Iron. You obviate another Inconvenience, when a whole Flask is warmed in boiling Water, as we uſe the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters, it will be apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit and make the whole Bottle flat and lifeleſs. But this Way may theſe <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters in the coldeſt Seaſons of the Year be drank, with the ſame Vertue, and therefore with as much Benefit as in Summer, nay, perhaps with many People to better Advantage; The Waters being more likely to paſs off by Urine in cold Weather, than in the hot Summer.</p>
            <p>Whereas I have animadverted above upon the great Quantity of Waters that are drank, at the ſour Brunns or <hi>Acidulae</hi> (ſo called) abroad, it ſeemed to me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible that any Perſon ſhould drink for ſeveral Days ſucceſſively, ſuch an extravagant Quantity as that of ſix or ſeven Quarts of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meaſure,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0538300300:49"/>which I now no more doubt of, having read it in Dr. <hi>Steigerthall</hi>'s ingenious Treatiſe; though I am very well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that it was never done with his Advice, nor with his Approbation. It is the more ſurpriſing to us, becauſe we do ſee very good Effects of a ſingle Flask of <hi>Spa</hi> Waters, (when they are good, that is, brisk and vigorous) in recovering Health, provided they are continued for near a Month more or leſs. One of theſe Flasks does not fully contain a Quart and half of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meaſure. It muſt be allow'd, that there may be now and then a Caſe extraordinary, which will require greater Quantities than what is uſual, but rarely any Thing ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive as what is here mentioned: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our <hi>Bath</hi> Patients, the Quantity of Two of our Quarts is eſteem'd a large Proportion; and moſt abide at One, or Three Pints: And Two Quarts of the Chalybeat are reckon'd a large Doſe, and to be allow'd to only very ſtrong Perſons.</p>

He obſerves, that Vitriol and Sulphur are found in the Glebe or Earth, from whence theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do ſpring, but yet does not give us one Proof or Experiment of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found any real Vitriol, or true Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, or any Acidity in thoſe Waters. He fills his Book with Imaginations and Quotations, expoſing other Mens Ignorance, whilſt he himſelf is plunged in the ſame common vulgar Errour.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Jordis,</hi> an eminent Phyſician at <hi>Francford,</hi> and a Fellow of the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Society,</hi> did formerly viſit the famous Well or ſour Brunn at <hi>Swalbach</hi> in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, and practiſed there during the Seaſon: I was my ſelf then exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Nature of all Sorts of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Cathartick and Chalybeat, or Steel Waters, and the other which contain the bitter purging Salts; my Requeſt to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0538300300:52"/>this very Learned Phyſician was, That he would give me an Account of the Contents of the ſaid Water, number'd amongſt the <hi>Acidulae;</hi> particularly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Diſtillation he could obtain any Thing ſour or acid, as Vinegar and Juice of Oranges will do this Way; but he could not ſatisfy me that the leaſt Drop of acid did riſe, or diſtil over. He alſo evaporated a great Quantity of this Water <hi>ad ſiccitatem,</hi> and thought that he found ſome Sulphureous Parts in it; but Sulphur it ſelf is far from being an acid, but the contrary. He alſo found Ocre and other ferrugineous Particles contain'd in it, but theſe we find in all Chalybeat Waters, which do truly belong to the Nature of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalis, and not of Acids.</p>
            <p>That which gave me the firſt Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that the Chalybeat Waters did not contain any rough or acid Salts in them, proceeded from an accidental Uſe of a very ſtrong Iron Water, which happen'd to me above Thirty Years ago, in ſuch a Place, where I could get no other: In this Water I diſſolved my Soap, waſhed my Hands, and found it to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beyond my Expectation, I alſo ſhaved with it. I afterwards tried ſome
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0538300300:53"/>other Chalybeat Waters, which did the ſame, that is, much better than Pump Water did.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I conſulted my Palate, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether I could diſcover any Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Acidity in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Steel Waters at <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> at the <hi>Black-Boy</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Franfield</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> at <hi>Hampſtead, Sunning-Hill</hi> in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> and other Places; But I was ſo far from diſcovering any ſuch Thing, that theſe Waters ſeem'd rather to leave a ſweetiſh Flavour or Farewel behind: Thus many Alkaly Salts, if nicely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, (of the fixed Kind) have affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Taſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I made Experiments with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sorts of ſuch Spirits as are apt to ferment with Acids, ſuch as Spirit of <hi>Hartſhorn,</hi> of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> &amp;c. but theſe made no Ferment, nor any Motion, or Efferveſcence in theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I conſidered the Diſeaſes in Humane Bodies, which thoſe Waters were preſcribed by Phyſicians to cure; That they were often ſuch as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0538300300:54"/>from ſharp, acid, or acrimonious Cauſes, as <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> or Heart Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſour Vomitings, corroſive Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raea's, Colicks from Scurvies and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guries; and that for theſe Diſtempers ſweetning and alkaliſate Remedies are made Uſe of.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I conſider'd theſe Waters as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in them the Properties of Iron, and I find by Experience, that it is moſt oppoſite to Acids, being one of their great Correctors; and therefore rather to be eſteemed an Alkaly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take ſome Filings of Iron, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a Dram, and pour on them about an Ounce of the milder Acids, ſuch as Vinegar, Verjuice, or the Juice of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and it will deſtroy the Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe Juices: Or if you pour on theſe Filings, Mineral Acids, as the very corroſive Spirit of Nitre, or of Salt, or what is called Oil of Vitriol, they will immediately loſe their Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, be diſarm'd of their ſharp Points, and by Evaporation give a Salt that will taſt ſweetiſh, and is by Chymiſts called <hi>Saccharum Martis,</hi> if duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0538300300:55"/>which is ſafely given inwardly, and is eſteemed a good altering Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Steel beaten to a fine Powder, is without any farther Preparation given inwardly with great Succeſs for Stomachick Diſeaſes, as in the Green-Sickneſs, Hypocondriack, and various other acid and acrimonious Diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="5">V. I conſidered Milk to be a very proper and obvious Subject to bring this Controverſy to a plain and unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Deciſion. I made this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all poſſible Exactneſs: I firſt proved the Chalybeat Waters, more particularly the <hi>Spa</hi> Waters, by trying whether, they tinged with Galls. Theſe being very good, I put Part of the Waters to cold Milk, ſome I only made Lukewarm, and ſome I boiled together in equal Proportions; But they were ſo far from affording any Curd or Coagulation, that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſeveral Days without being ſour. Since Mineral Waters, eſpecially thoſe that are Chalybeat, are of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0538300300:56"/>Uſe in Phyſick, and have gain'd amongſt us ſo juſt a Reputation for their excellent Vertues, and are the greateſt Refuge in very potent and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Diſeaſes; This has made me judge it a Work not unacceptable to Virtuoſo's, eſpecially thoſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Phyſick, to have this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine fairly examin'd, its genuine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties aſſerted, and what was called an Acid, to be demonſtrated an Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Is it not a Sort of Juſtice due to the World, that the <hi>Germans,</hi> who ſent us over theſe Waters, with this falſe Character of ſour Waters, ſhould ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this miſguiding Term from their <hi>Spa's?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is from this Miſtake, that their Phyſicians do prohibit the Uſe of all Manner of <hi>Lacticinia,</hi> as if they were as noxious as deadly Poiſons, whilſt they are in a Courſe of their Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Waters, unjuſtly called Sour Brunns.</p>
            <p>Since this Prejudice has prevailed very much amongſt moſt of our Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Drinkers in <hi>England,</hi> I do atteſt, that I have frequently advis'd in ſome Caſes, Milk to be given daily in the Evening, through a whole Courſe of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0538300300:57"/>Steel Waters, with good Effect: Nay, I do affirm, that ſome others could not bear theſe Waters without having a Third Part of Milk or more, mixed with them; and have continued them ſo for many Weeks with good Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: Nor do I find the leaſt Reaſon to prohibit the Uſe of Milk in a Courſe of <hi>Bath</hi> Waters, having been there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Year and half, making the beſt Scrutiny I could into the Properties; Vertues, and Vices (if they have any) of thoſe Waters: Here we uſe Aſſes Milk Morning and Afternoon in the Uſe of <hi>Bath</hi> Waters; nor did I ever forbid Cows Milk, where it agreed with that Perſon, at any other Time.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Since our Experiments diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that thoſe Things which are of a ſweetning Alkaliſate Nature, do ſo very well agree with theſe Mineral Waters, it will appear by the following Experiment, that Acids do very much diſagree.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I put but one Drop of Oil of Vitriol to a large Glaſs full of ſtrong <hi>Spa</hi> Waters, which, before the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0538300300:58"/>of this Acid, did give a deep Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Solution of Galls, but now would not give the leaſt Tincture, though I put in Four Times, as much of the Galls: From hence I conclude, That the Vertues of the Chalybeat Ingredients, which I take to be the Life and Soul of theſe Waters, were ſo far bound up or deſtroyed, as to have loſt their Cordial, or corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Faculty, and that the Bile or Gall in the Humane Bowels, could not be able to ſeparate the Chalybeat (which are the only medical) Particles, and mix them with the Chyle, in order to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer any End in Phyſick.</p>
            <p>Let this be a Caution to thoſe that deſign to make theſe Waters paſs better by Urine, that they do not make Uſe of any Acids, it being a common Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to uſe Spirit of Vitriol, <hi>Spiritus Nitri dulcis,</hi> &amp;c. as a Diuretick, unleſs it ſhould ſo happen, that they have a Deſign to take off and diveſt them of their warm Cordial or altering Power, and ſo to bring them near to common Water; which I muſt confeſs we are forc'd to do, eſpecially in the Uſe of <hi>Bath</hi> Waters, in ſome hot inflammatory Caſes.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0538300300:59"/>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall conclude with one ſhort Experiment in Favour of our Alkalies; That if you put any Alkaly Salt, vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile or fixed, ſuch as volatile Salt of <hi>Hartſhorn,</hi> or of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> or fixed Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> of <hi>Wormwood,</hi> or any other true Alkaly, you will then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the abovenamed acid Spirit which was dropt into the Water, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Vertue of the Waters, and diſpoſe them to give their Tincture as they uſed to do in their natural State.</p>

            <p>AFter many fruitleſs Attempts to get a Book from <hi>Germany,</hi> which treated of theſe Waters <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> at length I obtained theſe Two, of which I ſhall give a ſhort Account; they did not come to my Hand until my little Tract was finiſhed, and my Papers were actually with the Printer.</p>
            <p>The Firſt I ſhall take Notice of, is one Dr. <hi>Cunaeus,</hi> whoſe Book was Printed about Seven Years ſince; of whom I ſhall have Occaſion to ſay very little, becauſe he treats of many Niceties and Impertinencies to the Cure of Diſeaſes; he enumerates an Abundance of his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum's</hi> and <hi>Noſtrum's,</hi> and imputes ſuch extraordinary Vertues to them, which make theſe ſanative Waters, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> needleſs. As to the Nature of the Waters, he had not the leaſt Imagination of their being any Thing elſe, but an <hi>Acidula,</hi> or ſour Brunn; but this miſtaken Notion will do leſs Harm than his Practice did, who,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0538300300:61"/>Page 17. directs the Patient at his firſt Drinking to begin with Two Quarts of the Waters; in another Place he gives a great Charge to the Water-Drinker, to have a great Care of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with that dangerous Thing Milk, and remarks, that ſeveral Children having drank theſe Waters, upon eating Milk, did fall into Convulſions and other Diſeaſes. He alſo obſerves, That ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons who did put Sugar into theſe ſour Waters, and others, who drank a Glaſs of Wine betwixt their Draughts of Waters, did by this Means fall into dangerous Diſtempers. As to Milk, not only my own Experience of many Years ſtanding, diſcharges it from cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any bad Effects if uſed the ſame Day, wherein the Patient drinks Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat Waters, but I have the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Teſtimony of the beſt of our Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians now alive, as well as of many that are lately dead, that they have put their Patients into a Courſe of joining Milk with our Steel Waters at <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and other Places, and have had the good Succeſs of making the Waters agree better with the Patient, and have cur'd that Diſeaſe this Way, which they could not do by by the Waters
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0538300300:62"/>alone. His judging and cenſuring Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar for having had malignant Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on thoſe that diſſolve it in theſe Waters, is abſolutely intolerable. Is it poſſible, that ſo innocent and pleaſant a Balſam can do any Harm? I have ſeveral Times caus'd my Patients at the <hi>Bath</hi> to mix fine white Sugar Candy with their Waters with very good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. I little ſuſpected to have a Glaſs of Wine forbid by a <hi>German,</hi> which I have found a neceſſary Diuretick for ſome. The Prohibition of mixing Wine with Chalybeat Waters to be drank at Meals will never take Place in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe both ſtrong and weak, the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ſickly, do conſpire with us here to drink it mixt at Meals, and declare it to be both pleaſant and beneficial. But it is high Time to paſs over ſuch Trifles, and to look into the following Author.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Seippius,</hi> appointed by Prince <hi>Waldeck,</hi> (the Proprietor of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess) to be the only Phyſician to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe at <hi>Pyrmont,</hi> has publiſhed his Book this Year, 1717.</p>
            <p>This ingenious and very induſtrious Perſon has taken much Pains to examine and enquire into the Principles and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0538300300:63"/>Operations of theſe Waters. He has made many curious and uſeful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have led him nearer the Standard of Truth, than any of his Predeceſſors. For thoſe Contents or Ingredients which he found in the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Water, he is forc'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs, that they are all Alkalies, and that hey cannot exert the leaſt acid Effect in the Waters, but rather owns them to have a healing and balſamick Quality; ſo that in reality he ought to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Proſelyte to my new Notion, that even this <hi>Pyrmont</hi> ſour Brunn, is a ſweet dulcifying Water, and a true Alkaly.</p>
            <p>But yet ſuch is the Prejudice of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and common Opinion, that even this candid Author cannot altogether in the firſt Part of his Tract clear himſelf of this wrong Notion, of theſe Waters having an acid or ſour Taſt, which does <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot appear to me, nor to any of my Friends, who attentively conſider it. He alſo thinks, that there is a latent Acid conceal'd in theſe Waters, and that it comes from the Sulphur of the Pyrites, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom which theſe medicated Waters are derived; but ſtill he confeſſes, that this Acid can exert no manner of Effect,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0538300300:64"/>being quite ſubject to thoſe Alkalies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Water.</p>
            <p>The Contents of theſe Waters, he ſays, are a ſweet, ſubtle, Alkaly Earth, have the Selenites, or ſomewhat like a tranſparent Cryſtal, a ſmall Quantity of Salt, Iron and Sulphur. We do even in our Mineral Waters, eſpecially in that of the <hi>Bath,</hi> find a Sort of a Cretaceous Subſtance, which we ſay is from the <hi>Lapis Calcarius;</hi> (with which our Earth in <hi>England</hi> does much abound) and ſeems to be that very tranſparent Subſtance which he calls Selenites, and the ſweet Alkaly Earth. Iron is indeed a very great Alkaly, abſorbs and corrects all Acids, as we have prov'd to a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in this Tract.<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Page</hi> 40, 41.</note> It is from the Sulphur or Brimſtone which he diſcovers in thoſe Waters, that an Acidity or Sourneſs is thought to be deriv'd to theſe Waters, which ſtill is only imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, becauſe the contrary Quality ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be there.</p>
            <p>I muſt own, That I formerly never ſo much as doubted Sulphur to be other than an Acid, having always heard ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0538300300:65"/>much Talk of the very ſharp Oil of Sulphur, and Gas of Sulphur, beſides the very ſuffocating and acrimonious Vapour of Brimſtone, when kindled or made to flame, might eaſily impoſe ſuch a falſe Opinion upon the unwary; but Experiment will prove juſt the contrary, and we ſhall find it rather to belong to the Alkalies, and not to have the leaſt Shew or Footſtep of an Acid in it: No, not to have ſo much of the Acid in it, as the pleaſant and ſweeteſt Wine of <hi>Italy,</hi> or the <hi>Canaries</hi> contain in them; for theſe, when boiled with Milk, make a ſtrong Curd, which Sulphur will not do.</p>
            <p>The Experiment. We took a Dram of Flowers of Brimſtone, and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Pint of Milk, and boiled them together, they did not in the leaſt cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Milk, but made it taſt more ſoft and balſamick than it did before. If you taſt Sulphur, it lies ſoft upon the Tongue, does not give the leaſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acid Reliſh; on the contrary, from hence are our healing and pectoral Balſams made, and many cutaneous and itching Diſtempers of the Skin, where the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours do tare and lacerate the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0538300300:66"/>Parts, Sulphur is made Uſe of as a vulnerary, and cures beyond moſt other Applications. It is true it has a ſtrong offenſive Smell, but not the leaſt of an acid Smell, Taſt, or Quality, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you reduce it to Flame; and then it is no longer Sulphur, but what proceeds from it is actually a Creature of the Fire. Let me give one common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to ſhew the Difference between a Subſtance in its natural State, and when brought to an actual Flame, <hi>viz.</hi> good Oil of Olives may be ſwallow'd for a healing, pleaſant, inward Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and is outwardly apply'd to eaſe an Inflammation or heal a Sore; in like manner the Tallow of a Candle may be apply'd to a ſore Part, but if you touch the Flame of either of theſe, you will be made ſenſible, that they have loſt all their Properties, and that what was a vulnerary, is become now of a corroſive and devouring Nature.</p>
            <p>I perceive, that this ſedulous Author has by ſtrong Fires diſtilled ſome acid Spirits out of great Quantities of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment of the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters, which may well be obtain'd from thoſe Salts and Sulphurs, he ſays, are contain'd in them; but whatever they are, I do po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0538300300:67"/>aſſert theſe acid Spirits to be Creatures of the Fire, and not to have been originally in the Water; Thus Oil of Vitriol (which our Author truly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts to be the ſame with Oil of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur) is only Fire wrapt up, or incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in a little moiſt Vehicle, will burn your Fleſh, raiſe Bliſters, heat Water, and give many other Proofs of its fiery Nature; which it may well do, having been perhaps 24 Hours a conſtant igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Body of Fire.</p>
            <p>Having prov'd Sulphur to be an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly, this will furniſh our Author with one Argument more, and a very ſtrong one, to eſtabliſh the Opinion, that our Chalybeat Waters are Alkalies, not <hi>Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulae;</hi> for what Refuge can the Acidiſt fly to in order to the ſupporting the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Waters being an <hi>Acidula,</hi> or a ſour Brunn; ſince even Brimſtone it ſelf (contain'd in theſe Waters, and judg'd an unqueſtionable Acid) proves to be the Reverſe, or juſt contrary?</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledge my ſelf very much indebted to him for this following Experiment, which alone would ſuffice to put a finiſhing, deciſive Stroak to all this Controverſy: In Page 109. he ſays, <hi>That theſe Waters do make a pretty ſtrong
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0538300300:68"/>Efferveſcence with all Sorts of Sours, as with Vinegar, Wine, Spirit of Nitre, of Salt, of Vitriol:</hi> This Experiment outdoes all I ever met with, for none of our Waters (though ſome of them ſeem full of Iron) do in the leaſt pretend to ſuch an Alkaly, as in the leaſt to ferment with Acids. But if this ſhould fail, as I can ſcarce think it will, becauſe it is ſo poſitively aſſerted, that when freſh taken up at the Fountain Head it does ferment; yet the following Experiment exhibits as certain, tho' not ſo ſudden a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. He makes Uſe of Milk, and boils it with his Waters, and declares, that they will not curdle, but rather that they do preſerve the Milk from coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating: See Page 148, 248. of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. He makes the ſame Experiment and Obſervation with mine Printed in the Tranſaction above 3 Years ſince, and ſince reprinted here.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 41.</note> And infers as we do, that this is a ſtrong Argument of the Alkalies contained in theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>Our Author takes Notice of a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Salt he finds in theſe Waters,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0538300300:69"/>at the utmoſt 14 Grains in a Quart, to which he would aſcribe the ſame purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vertue; that our purging Salts have; but having had a Deſire to ſatisfy my ſelf in this Matter, I cauſed a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Chymiſt to make an accurate Examen of theſe Waters new brought over, and he obtained about Ten Grains of Salt which one Quart afforded; this Salt conſiſted of a conſiderable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Sea-Salt mixt with a bitter Salt; but had the Water held ten times the Quantity of that Compound Salt, it could not have cauſed one Purge, eſpecially ſince theſe Waters are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reſtringent, and guarded with ſtiptick Ingredients.</p>
            <p>Now we are giving due Praiſes to the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters, we may alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that Juſtice be done to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> purging Salts, which are deſervedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd and receiv'd in our <hi>Materia Medica:</hi> This Author wrong repreſents them as a Chymical Compoſition of ſome Alkaly or other, join'd with an Acid: To my certain Knowledge many Centners of Pounds have been made out of our Purging Waters; but now indeed they have found out another Sort of a <hi>Minera,</hi> which produces this very
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0538300300:70"/>particular Salt, and is of the very ſame Figure, Taſt, and Operation; but after this Way it can be made at leſs Expence, which ſtill contributes more Good to Mankind. There is no more Art us'd in making this admirable Salt, than in making our common Sea Salt, there is nothing added to it, only other Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſeparated from it. Our Sea Salt may more pertinently be ſtyled an Artificial Chymical Compoſition than this purging Salt, becauſe there are more Things added to make that Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulat than are requir'd for this, tho' they are both hewn from off the ſame Rock, or dug out of the ſame Mine. I do not think it the worſt Action of my Life for having been an early Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in preparing and bringing this purging Salt into Practice; having made and uſed it before Doctor <hi>Grew,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Phyſician, publiſh'd it to the World: It was once at 20 <hi>s.</hi> the Pound, he brought it to 8 <hi>s.</hi> I rejoice to ſee it, for the good of the Poor, at 12 <hi>d.</hi> the Pound: So that now they may have 16 Purges for one Shilling.</p>
            <p>I have remarked above, that of late our Practice condemns the giving large Quantities of our ferruginous Waters. Our
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0538300300:71"/>Author here goes on ſomewhat faſt in advancing ſo high as to direct Three Quarts of Water to be given to the Drinker the Third Day, but he makes a Stand at Four Quarts: I know it is a hard Matter, where the Practice of Drinking great Quantities has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long, not to be born down with the Torrent of ancient Cuſtom; but yet I muſt ſay in his Commendation, that though he be yet a young Man, he ſees the Error, and will doubtleſs ſhake off the Prejudice of Cuſtom and Education: For in Page 203. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, that it were safer and better to drink the Waters more moderately, and, as he ſays, <hi>not to offer Violence to Nature,</hi> but to allow more Time for a Cure.</p>
            <p>This very Method would prevent another Inconvenience of Purging ſo much as they do; for if they did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharge the Drinker with ſuch Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Water, there would general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking) be no need of Catharticks to diſcharge that Burden.</p>
            <p>Both later and former Drinkers of the mention'd Waters at <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>THE unknown, or conceal'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, will doubtleſs be found out at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> eſpecially at this Fountain Head, with a vaſt Train of Patients daily crouding about theſe All-healing Waters; to which he aſcribes ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Vertues, as far exceed all other Waters, but eſpecially <hi>German Spa</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: We are very ſeverely chid and cenſur'd for our <hi>great Vanity and Folly in buying, and Cheats in ſelling theſe</hi> Waters; and that we may be ſure not to overlook this Cenſure, it is put in the Title Page of this Book.</p>
            <p>The Characters or Encomiums he gives, or attributes to theſe new-found Waters, are very great. That they do excel other Waters, in their pleaſant and brisk, or ſpirituous Taſt, in the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of keeping many Months without Loſs of Strength, in their Volatility, and doing great Cures, and in many other ſuper-excellent Qualities he aſſigns them,

            <p>For my Part, I am perſwaded that he would ſoon have Numbers of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and Advocates, to join with him in extolling and recommending his Waters, provided they could be aſſured of the Truth of their aſſumed Vertue. Nor would he have Cauſe to be jealous of the Faculty it ſelf, of being ſuch Fools and Aſſes as he ſeems to deſcribe them, pag. 82. <hi>Stiff Zealots, adhering to their own Opinions, like Aſſes being once led to Water; will drink at the ſame Place if poſſible.</hi>

Wherefore the Author muſt expect ſome Queries, or Remarks, or Poſtulata, will be propos'd: I ask leave only for ſome very few, having no Room for many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Let me candidly expoſtulate with our Author, whether be has taken the beſt Way to convince us of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Excellency of his Waters, by depreciating others, and ſo dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally aſſerting the Value of his own? Why did he not ſend a Hamper of his Waters to the Preſident and Electors of the College, and that in Time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Book had been delivered to them. This was eaſy for him to do, becauſe his Waters may be dip'd in the Morning, and be delivered at <hi>London</hi> in the Even; This was done by me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I preſumed to give my Account of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rmont</hi> Water; I obtained the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Two famous Societies, having brought a Quantity of theſe Waters for them to taſt, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine by other Experiments: This Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is oft kept back by contrary Winds,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0538300300:76"/>and ſo came not to my Hands before it had been dip'd at leaſt Two Months, and at leaſt 8 Months before either of the Societies had it preſented to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Does he think, That an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart <hi>Spring of Water, which he ſays,</hi> pag. 126. <hi>is lately diſcovered at</hi> Ipſwich, <hi>and that has but ſix Weeks obtained its full Perfection,</hi> ſhould ſo ſuddenly gain ſuch Authority and Power, as to prohibit or proſcribe the Uſe of thoſe celebrated <hi>German</hi> Waters, which Phyſicians of the preceding, as well as the preſent Age, have ſucceſsfully preſcribed to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Is it not more likely that he aims at his own Intereſt more than at the Good of Mankind? What is the Meaning of his taking Care to have an <hi>Arcanum</hi> of his to be alſo mixt with theſe Waters, he gives it the Name of <hi>Tinctura Baſilica;</hi> which it ſeems is ſold up and down the Town of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> as <hi>Daphy's</hi> Elixir, or <hi>Stoughton's</hi> Drops? Altogether conſidered, it, makes one ſhrewdly ſuſpect, that the Doctor and Proprietor have a great Regard to ſelf and by-Ends: when convinced of the contrary, I ſhall ſoon retract.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0538300300:77"/>
            <p>In the Title Page we are told, that he has made <hi>ſeveral curious Experiments and nice Obſervations, ſuch as were never before made.</hi> Give me leave to challenge 2 or 3 of theſe nice Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He endeavours to prove an Acidity in theſe Waters, and is led into the old <hi>German</hi> Error of the <hi>Acidulae.</hi> In Page 121. he ſays, <hi>Having taken about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Pint of Milk, and cauſed it to be heated, I poured into it whilſt it was warm about four Spoonfuls of the</hi> Ipſwich Spa, <hi>and it immediately turn'd it to Curds, as if Beer, or ſome mild Acid had been poured in.</hi> For my Part, I ſhould much leſs eſteem his Water, if it were ſo as he ſays, that it would turn Milk, and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf an Acid; for Acids cauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſeaſes, and we fly to Alkalies for the Cure. But I ſtand amazed at this Aſſertion of his, when I am morally certain of the contrary, and that there is no Chalybeat Water in <hi>England</hi> that is Acid, or produces this Effect on Milk.</p>
            <p>But to give my ſelf more Satisfaction, I procured ſome Bottles from the <hi>Ipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> Fountain, which came to my Hands full, well cork'd, and carefully ſeal'd. I made the Experiment as above di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, but could not make any Curd
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0538300300:78"/>to riſe: I made farther Experiments in Favour of the Water, I doubled and trebled the Quantity of the Water, to ſee if by any Means I could curdle the Milk, but nothing ſucceeded: Have a Care that you uſe new Milk, and do not miſtake a few Creamy, or Oily Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that will ſtick to the Side of any Glaſs, and call that Curd. Intereſt and Prejudice can diſcover what they have a Mind to.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He runs much upon a volatile Acid, as if it were one of the grand Principles of his own, and even all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Waters. See Page 52. and in many other Places. Is it not ſtrange, that the Promiſer of ſuch curious Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Title Page, ſhould not put it upon this moſt natural and eaſy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in the World, which a very ordinary Chymiſt may perform? Why did he not (ſince he lives near the Spring) put a Quart or two of this Water into a Glaſs Limbec, (called Head and Body) or any other Still, and by a very gentle Fire receive the Liquor that came over, and ſo taſt and try it whether it held any Acidity or no? Does not this Omiſſion put a Man juſtly upon the Queſtion, whether
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0538300300:79"/>this Author has really a Mind to find out Truth or no? For my Part, I can tell him the Fate of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he will certainly diſtil over an inſipid Water, even from the firſt to the laſt Drop in the Still, becauſe I have tried many ſuch Waters as his this way, and none of them ever gave the leaſt Drop of an Acid.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He alſo aſſerts, and takes it for granted, that the fixt Salts that remain after Evaporation are Acid. It is ſtrange that this muſt alſo be ſupppoſed, and not tried. I found in his Waters, which is the Condition of moſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chalybeat Waters, that they contain very little Salt. Out of his <hi>Ipſwich</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I could only get Two Grains from a Pint; I tried it with Milk, but it would not curdle half a Spoonful of Milk after ſeveral Days ſtanding in a Window: I gained Five Grains out of a Pint of <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters, (which Waters do hold more Salt than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the true Chalybeat Waters. I have ſeen or heard of) I put theſe Grains to one Spoonful of Milk, which did keep the Milk, from curdling full Seven Days in <hi>September.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0538300300:80"/>
            <p n="4">4. He ſays he has experimented this, that his Waters have not only 14 Days, but as many Weeks, kept their intire Vertue. I wiſh he had try'd them whether they would carry to <hi>London,</hi> as far as the College of Phyſicians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe which I ſent for did not carry Four Days, ſo as to hold their Vertue; and truly by the courſe <hi>Ocra</hi> I found at the Bottom, they ſeem to me to reſemble <hi>Iſlington</hi> Waters, which will loſe their Vertue in 24 Hours.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid in the high Praiſe of the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> Waters, being a Foreign <hi>German</hi> Water, muſt certainly expoſe me to the Diſpleaſure of this Author; eſpecially ſince I have alſo in ſome low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Degree juſtified the Vertue of the <hi>Spa,</hi> when brought to us in a good Condition; and this I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this laſt Year they have been brought us better than formerly; tho' I am ſure it is not in their Nature to preſerve their Vertue as the <hi>Pyrmont</hi> will do.</p>
            <p>Now I conclude with my hearty Wiſhes, that this Endeavour of mine to ſerve my Neighbour may have ſome good Effect. I can aſſure the Reader,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0538300300:81"/>that a ſincere Love of Truth, diveſted of all Manner of private Intereſt, has been the only Motive of this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>I pretend not to Infallibility, ſome Errors and Miſtakes, and ſome unjuſt Cenſures will attend every Writer; he that candidly convinces me of the former, ſhall always have the Thanks of</p>
