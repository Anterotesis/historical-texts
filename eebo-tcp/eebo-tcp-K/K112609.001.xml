            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE importance of Hiſtory, as an object of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious attention, has been ſo frequently illuſtrated, and ſo generally admitted, that to attempt freſh arguments in ſupport of its extenſive utility, would be as ſuperfluous, as it would be ſceptical and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to bring it into queſtion. But Hiſtory, when employed in elucidating <hi>Public Concerns,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording NATIONAL TRANSACTIONS, however import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the Stateſman, or amuſive to the Politician, does not come ſo immediately home to the concerns and feelings of mankind, as the particular branch of this literary ſcience which develops the ſources of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual action, and traces the footſteps of eminent Characters, from the vale of obſcurity to the ſublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Fame, or the ſplendid abodes of opulence and power. The fate of brave or injured nations, may, it is true, call forth our ſympathetic feelings, and the exploits of heroic armies may warm the gratified ſoul with the enthuſiaſm of admiration; but he who devotes his labours to the narrative of facts like theſe, though he may claim a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading laurel as his reward, confers not an equal obligation on ſociety, with him who, dedicating his attention to the minuter, but more philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal branch of hiſtory, perpetuates the Conduct and
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0613800301:5"/>
Characters of Individuals, and preſerves, in durable colours, the mental features of thoſe with whom we might deſire to aſſimulate, or whoſe example it ſhould be our wiſh to ſhun. The former province of the Hiſtorian, it is true, fills the mind with more grand ideas, and better ſerves to produce the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative pleaſures, or awakens ſurpriſe and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is from the latter we are to ſeek for the inſtruction, which, in every department of life, may be found of practical importance.</p>
            <p>Biography does not only rouſe to emulation, by ſhewing the rewards of genius and application, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the proper objects of patronage and renown, and holding up to our view the moſt ſplendid and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive examples: it furniſhes alſo the means of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, by putting us in poſſeſſion of the experience of former candidates; and thus ſmoothing before us the thorny and intricate paths which conduct to the favoured goal. To ſpeak by a more familiar figure, Biography unfolds the motives and ſources of human conduct; it diſplays the minute ſprings which firſt ſet the grand machine in action; and traces, from wheel to wheel, the intricate movements by which the whole ſyſtem is put in motion, and the important effects are produced: while general Hiſtory affords only the repreſentation of Facts; leaving the mind to wander in the regions of uncertainty, vaguely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing by what means ſimilar attainments are again to be expected. In ſhort, Biography may be
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0613800301:6"/>
called the Key of the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> by means of which we are initiated among the ſecret myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe apparent miracels which, in the grand ſphere of human action, have contributed to ſurpriſe and ennoble mankind; while the Hiſtory of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Events, leaves us awe-ſtruck without the Temple, gazing with wonder at the dazzling phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena.</p>
            <p>The foregoing remarks are applicable to Biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy in general; and would, in ſome reſpects, not only ſuit the preſent publication, but be equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent as an introduction to the labours of the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic Plutarch, and the light ſketches of the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but penetrating Cheſterfield. But the Biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia Addenda, with which we have enriched our work, makes it neceſſary we ſhould particularly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the ſuperior advantages of <hi>modern</hi> Biography.</p>
            <p>Man is at all times, and in all countries, the ſame; that is to ſay, as to the admixture of vices and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, powers and weakneſs; and, therefore, the HIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORY OF MAN, in every Age, in every Country, is a ſerious and inſtructive object for MAN'S ATTEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION. But thoſe qualities and endowments, thoſe blemiſhes and perfections, are differently called into action at different periods, and in different places, by means of the prevalence of climate and of habit, of cuſtoms, of accidents, and examples, ſo as to produce various and widely diſſimilar modulations. Nay, with ſo much latitude is the general maxim of
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0613800301:7"/>
the uniformity of human nature, as a Maſs, to be underſtood, that blind indeed, to rationality and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, muſt be the pretended philoſopher, who ſhould not admit, that the different influences of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſes, at different times, and in different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, produce, not only an infinite diverſity of exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior deportment and appearances, but alſo the moſt material actual differences and changes in human character: ſo far as relates to the ſtate and intereſts of Society, and to whatever endowments are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the advancement and happineſs of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ages,</hi> as well as <hi>Nations,</hi> have their <hi>different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions</hi>; nor are the ſhades of <hi>mind,</hi> leſs curiouſly and progreſſively diverſified, than thoſe of cutaneous tint and phyſiognomical expreſſion The ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of human nature, therefore, which leads us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be delighted with the portraiture of a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary friend, than with the effigy of long mouldered anceſtors, or the heroes of diſtant climes, will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion us to peruſe with more <hi>pleaſure</hi> the lives of thoſe who have become famous in our own days, and who have diſtinguiſhed themſelves within the ſphere we ourſelves are to move, than the recorded exploits of ſuch as have, neither by age nor country, any hold upon our prejudices, or claim to our affections. Nor is this the only foundation of preference upon which this ſpecies of Biography reſts. Pleaſure, it is true, is a uſeful auxiliary to literature and ſtudy, whether
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0613800301:8"/>
conſidered as an object of allurement, or a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent gratification. But uſeleſs above every rank and order of ſociety, are the <hi>tribe</hi> of <hi>writers,</hi> if to amuſe is the only object at which they aim. A prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple like this would degrade the ſons of Science to a level with the graſshopper that chirrips in the fields, or the fly that flutters his painted wings among the bloſſoms of the ſpring.</p>
            <p>If it be <hi>inſtructive</hi> to con over the leſſons of POLICY <hi>and</hi> VALOUR which our plain rough anceſtors taught, when POLICY and VALOUR were in their infant ſtate, and to note the rude manner in which theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were by them exerted, how <hi>indiſpenſible</hi> is it that we call in the aid of Biography to conduct us to the Camps and the Cabinets of thoſe who have entered upon the ſcene of exertion but ſhortly before us, and who, conſequently, are our more proper guides and our more able inſtructors.</p>
            <p>Ancient and foreign Biography, may, it is true, ſhew us the general principles and grand traits of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and tend to the formation of ſteady cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; but they are the <hi>minutiae</hi> which ſecure a man's proſperity in life, and tend to ſtamp his reputation with the world; and he who ſhould attempt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement of theſe from any but his contemporaries and compatriots, would make no better figure in the ſeaſon of buſtle and action, than he who, with untu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored and antiquated courage, ſhould, twanging the Indian Bow in the face of an European phalanx, defend himſelf with a breaſt-plate and target, againſt
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0613800301:9"/>
the thunder of modern Artillery. Hence then it is evident, not only that "the proper <hi>ſtudy</hi> of <hi>mankind</hi> is man," but that the moſt important leſſon in the courſe of this ſtudy, is that which teaches us to conſider <hi>man</hi> under all the impreſſions which the <hi>climate</hi> and <hi>age</hi> we live in, have ſtamped upon his <hi>character</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This branch of ſtudy is equally eſſential, whether we conſider it as the mean of diving into the hearts and characters of others, or of aſſiſting and directing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the departments of life to which by chance or inclination we are attached. In the former caſe it enables us to detect the fallacy of habitual deluſion, in the latter it points out the track which we ought, in prudence, to purſue.</p>
            <p>As to the particular object to which the ſtudy of Biography ſhould be directed, inclination and caprice may be the directors of many, while, with others, profeſſion, or other circumſtances of intereſt or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, muſt neceſſarily determine; And though this firſt volume preſents but few examples of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern caſt, it is intended, in the proſecution of the work, to give ſo ample a collection, as to furniſh abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of argument, both for the amuſement and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Reader, by whatever taſte or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he may be directed in his ſtudies.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>AMONG all the literary purſuits of life, none claim a greater attention than the inſtructive ſtudy of BIOGRAPHY.—It has advantages ſuperior to general hiſtory; it repreſents great men detached from the crowd of other actors, and by deſcending into a detail of their actions and characters, it throws more light on human nature, excites more to imitation, and exhibits the human mind in all forms and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The ſtriking facts of hiſtory, the riſe of ſtates, or the fall of kingdoms, affect the reader but for a moment; the monarch or the ſtateſman alone find opportunities to reduce the knowledge gained from them to practice. But when BIOGRAPHY ſhews the effects of vice or folly in an individual; or when by the exertion of any virtue, we behold a ſhining character riſing to honour, or enabled to drive miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes far from him—then each perſon naturally makes the application to himſelf, and, if he is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of common ſenſe, will avoid the vice which
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0613800301:11"/>
may reduce him to the ſituation of the former, and carefully cheriſh that virtue which has befriended the latter.</p>
            <p>In depicting the manners of a monarch, we may not only admire the ſhining traits of the character, but alſo learn to imitate him in his domeſtic virtues: in characters of a lower rank, we all find ourſelves highly intereſted, and may from every recited fact draw ſome uſeful inſtruction.</p>
            <p>A Select Syſtem of BIOGRAPHY therefore is and ought to be eſteemed a moſt uſeful as well as enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining publication. And it will be the ſtudy of the Editor to make choice of ſuch Lives only as will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Reader, without proving tedious.</p>

            <head>LIFE OF FRANCIS AARSENS.</head>
            <p>FRANCIS AARSENS, Lord of Someldyck and Spyck, was one of the greateſt miniſters for negociation the United Provinces could ever boaſt of. His father, Cornelius Aarſens, was Regiſter to the States; and being acquainted with Mr. Pleſſis Mornay, at the Court of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Prince of Orange, he prevailed upon him to take his ſon under him, with whom he continued ſome years. John Olden Barnevelt, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided over the affairs of Holland and the United Provinces, ſent him afterwards agent into France, where he learned to negociate under thoſe profound politicians, Henry IV. Villeroy, Silleri, Roſſie, Jaonnin, &amp;c. and acquitted himſelf in ſuch a manner as to attain their approbation. Soon after he was inveſted with the character of an ambaſſador, being the firſt who was recognized as ſuch by the French court; at which time Henry IV. declared, that he ſhould take precedence next to the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian miniſter. He reſided in France fifteen years; during which time he received great marks of eſteem from the king, who created him a knight and baron; and for this reaſon he was received amongſt the nobles of the province of Holland. However, he became at length ſo odious to the French court, that they deſired to have him recalled. He was afterwards deputed to Venice, and to ſeveral German and Italian princes, upon occaſion of the troubles in Bohemia. He was the firſt of three extraordinary ambaſſadors ſent to England in 1620, and the ſecond in 1641; in which latter embaſſy he was accompanied by the Lord of Brederode as firſt ambaſſador, and Heemſvliet as third, to treat about the marriage of Prince William, ſon to the Prince of Orange. He was likewiſe ambaſſador extraordinary at the French court in 1624; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0613800301:13"/>
the Cardinal de Richlieu having juſt taken the adminiſtration of affairs into his hands, and knowing he was an able man, made uſe of him to ſerve his own purpoſe. He died in a very advanced age; and his ſon, who ſurvived him, was reputed the wealthieſt man in Holland.</p>

            <head>ABARIS.</head>
            <p>A CELEBRATED ſage of antiquity, whoſe hiſtory and travels have been the ſubject of much learned diſcuſſion. Such a number of fabulous ſtories were told of him, that Herodotus himſelf ſeems to ſcruple to relate them. He tells us only, that this Barbarian was ſaid to have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with an arrow, and to have taken no ſuſtenance: but does not acquaint us with the marvellous properties which were attributed to that arrow; nor that it had been given him by the Hyperborean Apollo. With regard to the occaſion of his leaving his native country, Harpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration tells us, that the whole earth being infeſted with a deadly plague, Apollo, upon being conſulted, gave no other anſwer than that the Athenians ſhould offer up prayers in behalf of all other nations: upon which, ſeveral countries deputed ambaſſadors to Athens, among whom was Abaris the Hyperborean. In this journey, he renewed the alliance between his countrymen and the inhabitants of the iſland of Delos. It appears that he alſo went to Lacedaemon; ſince, according to ſome writers, he there built a temple conſecrated to Proſerpine the Salutary. It is aſſerted, that he was capable of foretelling earthquakes, driving away plagues, laying ſtorms, &amp;c. He wrote ſeveral books, as Suidas informs us. Himerius the ſophiſt applauds him for ſpeaking pure Greek; which attainment will be no matter of wonder to ſuch as conſider the ancient intercourſe there was between the Greeks and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboreans. If the Hebrides, or Weſtern Iſlands of Scotland (ſays Mr. Toland), were the Hyperboreans of Diodorus, then the celebrated Abaris was of that country; and likewiſe a Druid, having been the prieſt of Apollo. Suidas, who knew not the diſtinction of the inſular Hyperboreans, makes him a Scythian; as do ſome others, miſled by the ſame vulgar error; though Diodorus has truly fixed his country in an iſland, and not on the continent. Indeed the fictions and miſtakes concerning our Abaris are infinite: however, it is by all agreed that he travelled quite over Greece, and from thence into Italy, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed familiarly with Pythagoras, who favoured him beyond all his diſciples, by inſtructing him in his doctrines (eſpecially his thoughts of nature) in a more compendious method than he did any other. This diſtinction could not but be very advantageous to Abaris. The Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borean in return preſented the Samian, as though he equalled Apollo himſelf in wiſdom, with the ſacred arrow, on which the Greeks have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0613800301:14"/>
fabulouſly related that he ſat aſtride, and flew upon it through the air, over rivers and lakes, foreſts and mountains; in like manner as our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſtill believe, particularly thoſe of the Hebrides, that wizards and witches fly whitherſoever they pleaſe on their broomſticks. The ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Himerius abovementioned, though one of thoſe who, from the equivocal ſenſe of the word Hyperborean, ſeem to have miſtaken Abaris for a Scythian, yet deſcribes his perſon accurately, and gives him a very noble character.
<q rend="inline">"They relate (ſays he) that Abaris the ſage was by nation an Hyperborean, appeared a Grecian in ſpeech, and reſembled a Scythian in his habit and appearance. He came to Athens, holding a bow in his hand, having a quiver hanging on his ſhoulders, his body wrapt up in a plaid, girt about the loins with a gilded belt, and wearing trowſers reaching from his waiſt down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward."</q>
By this it is evident (continues Mr. Toland) that he was not habited like the Scythians, who were always covered with ſkins; but appeared in the native garb of an Aboriginal Scot. As to what relates to his abilities, Himerius informs us, that
<q rend="inline">"he was affable and pleaſant in converſation, in diſpatching great affairs ſecret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, quick-ſighted in preſent exigencies, in preventing future dangers circumſpect, a ſearcher after wiſdom, deſirous of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, truſting little to fortune, and having every thing truſted him for his prudence."</q>
Neither the Academy nor the Lycaeum could have furniſhed a man with fitter qualities to travel ſo far abroad, and to ſuch wiſe nations, about affairs no leſs arduous than important. And if we further attentively conſider his moderation in eating, drinking, and the uſe of all thoſe things which our natural appetites inceſſantly crave; joining the candour and ſimplicity of his manners with the ſolidity and wiſdom of his anſwers, all which we find ſufficiently atteſted; it muſt be owned, that the world at that time had few to compare with Abaris.</p>

She dreamed ſhe was told, if ſhe would eat a jack or pike, the child ſhe went with would prove a ſon, and riſe to great preferment. Not long after, ſhe accidentally caught a jack in a pail of water taken out of the river Way, and had an opportunity of fulfilling her dream. This ſtory was much talked of; and coming to the ears of ſome perſons of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they offered to become ſponſors to the child, which was accepted; and they afterwards ſhewed many teſtimonies of their affection to their godſon while at ſchool, and at the univerſity. This is the account given by Mr. Aubrey in his Antiquities of Surry, who ſeems to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired much about it. When he was of a proper age, he was ſent with his elder brother Robert to a free ſchool, erected by King Edward VI. in their native town of Guilford; and having paſſed through the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of literature, he was in 1578 removed to the univerſity of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and entered a ſtudent in Baliol College.</p>
            <p>November 29, 1588, being then bachelor of arts, he was elected pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationer fellow of his college, and afterward proceeding in the faculty of arts, he entered into holy orders, and became a celebrated preacher in the univerſity. He commenced bachelor of divinity in 1593, and proceeded doctor in that faculty in May 1597; and in the month of September of the ſame year he was elected maſter of Univerſity College.

great uneaſineſs to both. In the year 1598, he publiſhed a Latin work which did him great honour, and was afterwards reprinted at Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Germany; the title <hi>Queſtiones ſex totidem Praelectionibus in Scholae Theologica Oxoniae pro forma habitis diſcuſſae et diſceptatae, Anno</hi> 1597. In March 1599, he was inſtalled dean of Wincheſter, in the room of Dr. Heron, who was preferred to the biſhoprick of Ely. He was never dean of Glouceſter, as aſſerted by ſome writers. In 1600 he was vice-chancellor of Oxford, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf while in that high of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by the opinion he gave with reſpect to refixing the croſs in Cheapſide, about which there were great diſputes; but in the end he carried his point againſt Dr. Bancroft, then Biſhop of London, which gained him great reputation. He publiſhed the ſame year his Sermons on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Jonah, which were received with great applauſe. In 1603 he was again choſen vice-chancellor of the univerſity, and diſcharged that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with general approbation. The ſucceeding year, the tranſlation of the Bible, which is now in uſe, was made by direction of King James; Dr. Abbot was one of the eight divines in the univerſity of Oxford to whom the care of tranſlating part of the New Teſtament was committed. He likewiſe publiſhed this year an anſwer to Dr. Hill's Reaſons for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding Popery. In 1605, he was a third time vice-chancellor; and the ſucceeding year he is ſaid to have had a ſhare in the troubles of Laud, who was called to an account by the vice-chancellor, Dr. Ayrey, for a ſermon preached before the univerſity: that year he loſt both his father and mother. In 1608, Dr. Abbot's great patron, Thomas Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville Earl of Dorſet, lord high treaſurer of England, and chancellor of the univerſity of Oxford, died ſuddenly at the council table, at whoſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Dr. Abbot preached a ſermon, which was afterwards printed, and generally commended. After his deceaſe, Dr. Abbot became chaplain to George Earl of Dunbar, treaſurer of Scotland, one of King James's early favourites, and who had long a very high ſhare in his eſteem; with him he went this year into Scotland, in order to aſſiſt in the execution of an important deſign, for eſtabliſhing an union between the churches of the two kingdoms: in this he behaved with ſuch prudence and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as gained him a very high character, and is thought to have been the firſt ſtep to his future preferment. While he was at Edinburgh a proſecution was commenced againſt George Sprot, a notary of Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, for having been concerned in Gowrie's conſpiracy, eight years before, for which he was tried before Sir William Hart, lord juſtice general of Scotland, condemned and executed. A large account of this affair was drawn up by the judge, and a narrative prefixed thereto by Dr. Abbot, who had been eye-witneſs of all that paſſed; this was publiſhed at London, in order to ſettle the minds of the people with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0613800301:18"/>
to that conſpiracy, which had been hitherto looked upon as a very myſterious affair. The king well knew the difficulties to be encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe northern parts, and it gave him a high opinion of the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the man who was able to overcome them; and when another ſet of men raiſed apprehenſions in the king's mind, he had recourſe to Dr. Abbot. Thus, when the king was engaged in the mediation of peace between Spain and the United Provinces, he demanded the advice of the convocation then fitting as to the lawfulneſs of eſpouſing the cauſe of the States in their claim of independence. The convocation, inſtead of ſatisfying the king's ſcruples, launched at once into the wide ſea of politics: the king wrote a letter on this ſubject to Dr. Abbot, which is an inconteſtible proof of the confidence he had in him; and the Doctor ſtood ſo high in favour, that on the death of Dr. Overton in April 1689, he was, on the king's recommendation, promoted to the united ſees of Litchfield and Coventry. But this did not appear to his majeſty a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient recompence, and therefore in leſs than a month he was tranſlated to the biſhoprick of London, vacant by the death of Dr. Ravis.</p>
            <p>It was but a ſhort time that he poſſeſſed theſe biſhopricks, and yet he ſo remarkably diſtinguiſhed himſelf by the diligent performance of his function, by conſtant preaching, and by expreſſing the utmoſt readineſs to promote learning and learned men, that he obtained a general good character.</p>
            <p>While the biſhop was thus employed, a new opportunity offered of the king's teſtifying his eſteem of, and confidence in him, by the vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the archiepiſcopal ſee of Canterbury, on the 2d of November, 1610, on the death of Dr. Bancroft. The court biſhops immediately caſt their eyes upon the celebrated Dr. Andrews, then Biſhop of Ely, and pointed him out to the king as one ſufficiently qualified to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the government of the church. They thought this recommendation, joined to the king's known regard for this eminent man, enough to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his promotion to the primacy; but without taking the advice of thoſe prelates, his majeſty preferred Biſhop Abbot to the throne of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, on which he was ſeated on the 9th of April, 1611, and on the 23d of June following, was ſworn of his majeſty's moſt honourable privy council: thus we ſee him, before he had arrived at the age of fifty, exalted to the higheſt dignity in the church.</p>
            <p>At this time he was in favour both with prince and people, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have had a conſiderable hand in all the great tranſactions in church and ſtate. He was never eſteemed very fond of power, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of carrying his prerogative to an extraordinary height, yet as ſoon as he had taken poſſeſſion of the archbiſhoprick, he ſhewed a ſteady reſolution in the maintenance of the rights of the high commiſſion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0613800301:19"/>
court, and would not ſubmit to Lord Coke's prohibition: he likewiſe ſhewed his concern for the intereſt of the proteſtant religion abroad, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his majeſty's application to the States General againſt Conrade Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius, whom they called to the profeſſorſhip of Leyden. In which affair Sir Ralph Winwood was employed; and when it was found difficult to obtain from the States that ſatisfaction which the king deſired, his grace, in conjunction with the Lord Treaſurer Saliſbury, framed an expedient for contenting both parties. In all probability this alarmed ſome of the warm churchmen at home, who were by no means pleaſed with the king's diſcountenancing abroad thoſe opinions which themſelves favoured in both univerſities: but whatever their ſentiments upon this matter might be, Archbiſhop Abbot ſeems to have had as great concern for the church as any one, when he thought it really in danger; this appears by a ſhort and plain letter of his to Sir Ralph Winwood, about one Mr. Ammiot who had been appointed preacher in the congregation at the Hague; of whom the biſhop ſays, that he was very capable to breed up the captains and ſoldiers there in mutiny and faction, and conſequently very unfit for his office. His great concern for the true intereſt of religion made him a zealous promoter of the match between the Elector Palatine and the Princeſs Elizabeth; and that prince coming here in October 1612, his grace invited the nobility his attendants to an entertainment at his archiepiſcopal palace at Lambeth, where, though unexpected, the Elector himſelf appeared, to ſhew his great reſpect for the archbiſhop; and was ſo well pleaſed with his welcome, that when he feaſted the members of the privy council at Eſſex Houſe, he ſhewed particular reſpect to the archbiſhop and thoſe who attended him. The feſtivity occaſioned by the arrival of the Elector Palatine, was interrupted for a time by the illneſs and death of Henry Prince of Wales, in the 19th year of his age: our prelate had the melancholy office of attending that accompliſhed prince in his dying moments, and of preaching his funeral ſermon.</p>
            <p>On the fourteenth of February following, the marriage of the Elector with the Princeſs Elizabeth was ſolemnized with great ſplendour, the archbiſhop performing the ceremony on a ſtage erected in the middle of the royal chapel; and his electoral Highneſs before his departure, made a preſent of plate to the archbiſhop as a proof of the juſt ſenſe he had of the pains his grace had taken in accompliſhing his marriage; and as an additional mark of his confidence, he wrote to him from Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, relative to the cauſes of that diſcontent with which he left England.</p>
            <p>The concern his majeſty had ſhewn for removing Arminius and Vorſtius, had given their followers in Holland ſo much uneaſineſs, that Hugo Grotius, the great champion of their cauſe, was ſent over to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0613800301:20"/>
to endeavour to mitigate the king's diſpleaſure, and if poſſible to give him a better opinion of the Remonſtrants, as they began to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and we have a very ſingular account of the man and of his negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the pen of our archbiſhop.</p>
            <p>In the ſpring of the year 1613, the affair of the Charter-houſe was ſettled; his grace and the reſt of the truſtees took poſſeſſion of that place, purſuant to the will of Mr. Sutton. An affair happened about the ſame time, which diſturbed the primate not a little:—This was the famous caſe of the divorce between the Lady Francis Howard, daughter to the Earl of Suffolk, and Robert Earl of Eſſex, her huſband, which has been always conſidered as one of the greateſt blemiſhes of King James's reign, though the part the archbiſhop of Canterbury acted, added much to his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The circumſtances that attended this affair might poſſibly leſſen the king's favour to him in ſome reſpects, but he ſtill retained a great ſhare of it, as appears by the raiſing of his brother to the ſee of Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, in the year 1615; but with Queen Anne he ſtood always on the beſt terms. He made uſe of his intereſt with her majeſty, to engage her to recommend Mr. George Villiers, ſo well known afterwards, to his majeſty's favour, for which at that time the young man was ſo grateful as to call him father, and deſire his advice as to his behaviour, which the archbiſhop very freely gave him: happy would it have been for him if he had always followed thoſe counſels.</p>
            <p>Towards the cloſe of the next year, the famous Antonio de Dominis, archbiſhop of Spalato, took ſhelter here from the perſecution with which he was threatened by the pope, for diſcovering his diſlike both of the doctrine and diſcipline of the church of Rome, and was very kindly received by his majeſty, who was pleaſed to order the archbiſhop to entertain him till he was otherwiſe provided for by the king.</p>
            <p>In the ſpring of the year 1618 our archbiſhop loſt his brother the Biſhop of Saliſbury; and before his grief was well over for ſo near a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he met with freſh diſturbance from the king's declaration, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſports and paſtimes on the Lord's day. This declaration was ordered to be read in church, and the archbiſhop being at Croydon when it came thither, had the courage to forbid it being read; which however the king winked at, notwithſtanding there were ſome about him who let no opportunity ſlip of irritating him againſt this prelate: his grace did a great ſervice this year to the proteſtant religion, by procuring the manuſcript of Father Paul's excellent Hiſtory of the Council of Trent. The perſon employed to negociate the affair was Mr. Nathaniel Brent, who, with no ſmall hazard to himſelf, found means to convey the whole copy ſafe to England. The end of this year proved as diſagreeable to the biſhop as its beginning; in autumn the queen, his gracious miſtreſs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0613800301:21"/>
fell ill of that diſtemper which brought her to her end. The archbiſhop himſelf began alſo to grow infirm; and finding himſelf leſs fit for the affairs of the world, reſolved to enter upon a great and good deſign, which he had long meditated, as a teſtimony of his regard to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive town of Guilford, where, on the fifth of April, 1619, he was preſent when Sir Nicholas Kemp laid the firſt ſtone of his hoſpital, which the archbiſhop afterward nobly endowed. Towards the end of this year the Elector Palatine accepted the crown of Bohemia, which occaſioned great diſputes in the councils of King James; ſome deſiring that his majeſty ſhould not interfere in this matter, from a foreſight that it would produce a war in Germany; others again believing that both natural affection to his ſon and daughter, and a juſt concern for the proteſtant intereſt ought to have engaged him warmly to ſupport the new election. The archbiſhop agreed in ſentiment with the laſt mentioned party; and not being able at that time to attend the privy council, he wrote his mind with great plainneſs and freedom to the ſecretary of ſtate. The next year was in a great meaſure ſpent in debates and nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations upon this ſubject. The archbiſhop's declining ſtate of health making exerciſe neceſſary for him, he was accuſtomed to make a tour in ſummer into Hampſhire, and being invited by the Lord Zouch to hunt in his park, he there met with the greateſt misfortune that ever befel him; for while hunting, he let fly a barbed arrow from a croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, at one of the deer, and it unfortunately ſtruck Peter Hawkins, Lord Zouch's keeper, in the left arm, who had been warned more than once to keep out of the way; by which wound a large blood veſſel being pierced, he bled to death in an hour's time: this unforeſeen accident threw the archbiſhop into a deep melancholy, though he was not conſcious to himſelf of the leaſt inadvertency or indiſcretion; and throughout his whole life he obſerved a monthly faſt on a Tueſday, the day on which this fatal accident happened: he alſo ſettled an annuity of twenty pounds on the widow.</p>
            <p>This affair made a very great noiſe, and there wanted not ſome to repreſent it in a ſiniſter light to King James; but his majeſty gave his judgment of the matter in a ſhort and clear ſentence.—"An angel, " ſaid he, "might have miſcarried in this ſort." When he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards informed of the legal penalties which his grace had incurred by this accident, he wrote him a conſolatory letter, in which, among other things, he told him that he would not add affliction to his ſorrow, or take one farthing from his chattels, which were forfeited by law. The archbiſhop immediately retired to his hoſpital at Guilford, there to wait the deciſion of the great points, as to the irregularity which ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined he had incurred; for it happened that at this juncture there were four biſhops elected, but not conſecrated, and all, except Dr. Davenant,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0613800301:22"/>
ſcrupled the archbiſhop's capacity to lay hands upon them till he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared free from all imputation as to this fact. The king being informed of this, directed a commiſſion to conſider and reſolve the three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtions: 1. <hi>Whether the archbiſhop was irregular by the fact of invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary homicide?</hi> The Biſhop of Wincheſter, the two judges, and the two civilians, were very clear that he was not irregular, but the other five thought he was. 2. <hi>Whether that act might tend to ſcandal in a church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi> The Biſhop of Wincheſter, the Lord Chief Juſtice Hobart, and Dr. Steward doubted, all the reſt agreed that a ſcandal might be taken, though not given. 3. <hi>How his grace ſhould be reſtored in caſe the king ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the deciſion of thoſe commiſſioners who had found him irregular?</hi> All agreed that could not be otherwiſe done than by reſtitution from the king; but they varied in the manner: ſome thought it ſhould be done by the king, and by him alone, in the ſame patent with the pardon; others were for a commiſſion from the king directed to ſome biſhops; Judge Dodderidge and Sir Henry Martin were deſirous it ſhould be done both ways, for abundant caution. This return was made to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and accordingly a pardon and a diſpenſation paſſed the great ſeal, by which his majeſty aſſoiled the archbiſhop from all irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, &amp;c. (if any was incurred) and declared him capable of all metro-political authority. Such was the cloſe of this buſineſs, after a great variety of proceedings and many arguments publiſhed on both ſides. Yet all this could not ſatisfy the minds of thoſe who had ſcrupled his power of laying on hands; they petitioned the king that they might not be compelled to wound their conſciences by ſubmitting to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration; and in compliance with their deſire, the Biſhop of Lincoln was conſecrated in King Henry the Seventh's chapel, by the Biſhops of London, Worceſter, &amp;c.; and the Biſhop of Sarum, Exeter, and St. David's, in the chapel of the Biſhop of London's palace, by the ſame.</p>
            <p>It does not appear that his grace was at all leſſened in the king's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or his courage in any degree abated, by the ſuggeſtions of his enemies; on the contrary we find him, in the year 1622, oppoſing the Spaniſh match (a thing the king had ſet his heart upon) with the greateſt firmneſs, and even venturing to give his ſentiments under his hand on that ſubject in terms vigorous and emphatic. The king however remained fixed in his reſolution, and the articles agreed on for the ſaid marriage were ſworn to in the preſence of the archbiſhop, and other great officers of ſtate; notwithſtanding which they never took effect. In the parliament that met on the 19th of February 1623-4 our prelate took an active part in the meaſures which were then purſued for perſuading the king to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve his treaties with Spain, relating to the marriage and the palatinate. He delivered both the addreſs and the remonſtrance which were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0613800301:23"/>
to his majeſty from the two Houſes on this occaſion, and introduced the remonſtrance with a preamble expreſſing the joy of the parliament that the king had ſhewn himſelf ſenſible of the inſincerity of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and of the indignities offered by them to his ſon and daughter. This part of the preamble appears to have given ſome offence to James the Firſt: indeed Dr. Abbot was remarkably zealous in every thing in which the proteſtant religion was concerned. The archbiſhop thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward aſſiſted ſeldom at council, being hindered chiefly by his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but in the king's laſt ſickneſs he was called, and attended with great conſtancy, received the higheſt marks of the king's confidence, and was near him when he expired.</p>
            <p>At the coronation of King Charles the Firſt, the archbiſhop ſet the crown upon his head, though he was extremely weak, and much troubled with the gout. But he viſibly declined in that monarch's favour; and the Duke of Buckingham, who was his declared enemy, watched an opportunity to make him feel the weight of his diſpleaſure. This was at laſt taken, on his refuſing to licence a ſermon preached by one Dr. Sibthorpe, to juſtify and promote a loan which the king had demanded. This ſermon was preached at Northampton in the lent aſſizes 1627, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judges, and was tranſmitted to the biſhop, with the king's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to licence it; which he refuſed to do, and aſſigned reaſons for it. The ſermon was licenſed by the Biſhop of London (Dr. Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne) after many things had been corrected. It was reſolved that he ſhould ſuffer. Diſcourſes of this nature were ſo loud at court, that ſome of his grace's friends reported them to him; upon which he thought fit to retire to his palace at Croydon a month before his uſual time. On the 5th of July, Lord Conway, who was then ſecretary of ſtate, made him a viſit, and intimated to him that the king expected he would withdraw to Canterbury; which the archbiſhop declined, becauſe he had a law-ſuit at that time with the city; and deſired he might rather have leave to go to his houſe at Ford, five miles beyond Canterbury, which was yielded to. And on the 9th of October fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the king granted a commiſſion to the Biſhop of London, &amp;c. to execute archiepiſcopal authority: the cauſe aſſigned being, that the archbiſhop could not at that time in his own perſon attend thoſe ſervices which were proper for his cognizance and juriſdiction. Some writers have pretended that his ſuppoſed irregularity, occaſioned by the death of Peter Hawkins, was revived; but the commiſſion on record ſhews the contrary. But the archbiſhop did not remain long in this ſituation, for the neceſſities of the times rendering a parliament neceſſary, his grace was ſent for about Chriſtmas, and not only reſtored to his authority and juriſdiction; but on his coming to court from his palace at Lambeth,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0613800301:24"/>
was received by the Archbiſhop of York and the Earl of Dorſet, who conducted him to his majeſty; where having kiſſed the king's hand, he was deſired not to fail being at the council table twice a week. He ſat in the parliament which began on the ſeventeenth of March follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and continued the full exerciſe of his office ever after; of which it may not be amiſs to take notice in this ſingular inſtance:</p>
            <p>On the twenty-fourth of Auguſt 1628, he conſecrated Richard Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu to the ſee of Chicheſter, a man who had been remarkably buſy in ſupporting the pretence of his irregularity, and at this conſecration Dr. Laud, then Biſhop of London aſſiſted, which is the cleareſt proof that no doubts longer remained as to his irregularity, even with thoſe who loved him leaſt. In parliament the archbiſhop maintained his credit in a high degree, and it is more than probable that the knowledge of this procured ſuch marks of reſpect as were at this time afforded him by the court. When the petition of right, that great pillar of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh liberty was under conſideration, the archbiſhop delivered the ſenſe of the Houſe of Lords thereupon at a conference with the Houſe of Commons; and at the ſame time laid before them ſuch propoſitions as their lordſhips had agreed upon; for which thanks were returned in a ſet ſpeech by Sir Dudley Diggs.</p>
            <p>When Dr. Manwaring was brought before the bar of the Houſe of Lords by impeachment of the Commons, for having maintained in two ſermons preached before his majeſty, and afterwards publiſhed, that the king's royal will and command in impoſing loans, taxes, and other aids upon his people without common conſent in parliament, did ſo far bind the conſciences of the ſubjects of this kingdom, that they could not refuſe the ſame without peril of damnation, and that the authority of parliament is not neceſſary for the raiſing of aids and ſubſidies; the archbiſhop, by leave of the king, gave the doctor a ſevere but juſt admonition, and declared that he both diſliked and abhorred his two ſermons. The intereſt of Biſhop Laud was now ſo great at court that he drew up a ſcheme of inſtructions, which having the king's name at the head of them, were in the month of December 1629 tranſmitted to his grace, under the pompous title of His Majeſty's Inſtructions to the moſt Reverend George Lord Archbiſhop of Canterbury, containing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain orders to be obſerved and put in execution by the ſeveral biſhops in his province. Theſe inſtructions his grace communicated to his ſuffragan biſhops, in which he acted miniſterially; but to ſhew that he ſtill meant to exerciſe his authority in his own dioceſe, he reſtored Mr. Palmer and Mr. Unday to their lectureſhips after the Dean and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of Canterbury had ſuſpended them, and in other reſpects ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rigour of thoſe inſtructions, which were contrived to enforce the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0613800301:25"/>
particular notions of a prevailing party in the church. His conduct in this and other reſpects is ſaid to have made his preſence unwelcome at court; and ſo indeed it ſeems, for upon the birth of Charles Prince of Wales (afterwards King Charles II.) which happened on the 29th of of May 1630; Laud, then Biſhop of London, had the honour to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize him, as dean of the chapel, notwithſtanding the archbiſhop of Canterbury is the ordinary of the court, and the king's houſhold, wherever it is, are regarded as his pariſhioners, ſo that this was as much a ſlight upon the archbiſhop, as a favour towards his antagoniſt. The arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop however went on doing his duty without fear or favour; and yet one of the laſt acts of his life plainly ſhews that he was very far from being ſo indifferent towards the diſcipline and ceremonies of the church of England as ſome have repreſented him: by an order of his dated the 3d of July, 1633, requiring the pariſhioners of Crayford in Kent to receive the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper on their knees at the ſteps aſcending to the communion table. A month afterwards, viz. on the 4th of Auguſt in the ſame year he died at his palace of Croydon, worn out with cares and infirmities, at the age of ſeventy-one. He was buried, according to his own expreſs direction, in the chapel of our Lady, within the church dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in his native town of Guilford. Soon after his deceaſe a noble monument was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the effigies of the archbiſhop in his robes, ſupported by ſix marble pillars of the Doric order, raiſed on pedeſtals of books piled. On his tomb there is a large Latin inſcription to his honour.</p>
            <p>The facts above related clearly evince that he was a man of great natural parts; and theſe ſufficiently improved for the worthy performance of what ever his high ſtation in the church required. He ſhewed himſelf in many circumſtances of his life a man of great moderation towards all parties; a ſteady friend to the proteſtant religion; an honeſt though perhaps not an humble courtier; and one who was deſirous that the clergy ſhould have attracted the reverence and eſteem of the laity by the ſanctity of their manners, and the uprightneſs of their behaviour, rather than have claimed them as neceſſarily annexed to their function. Theſe notions of his ſquaring little with the humours of ſome writers, have drawn upon him many reflections. A late writer, juſtly eſteemed for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive knowledge of the Engliſh hiſtory, and not ſo much addicted to party, has done much more juſtice to the virtues and abilities of this great prelate. His charity and public ſpirit (ſays he) ought certainly to have been ſet in a clearer light than hitherto they have been by the friends to the church. In regard to his learning, ſucceeding ages may judge thereof from his writings upon various ſubjects. It may not be amiſs to obſerve here, that there was another writer, of both his names,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0613800301:26"/>
who flouriſhed ſomewhat later. This George Abbot wrote a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe on Job, a Vindication of the Sabbath, and a Paraphraſe on the Pſalms. Alſo another George Abbot, who was the ſon of his brother Maurice Abbot.</p>

            <p>BROTHER to George, was bred to trade, and became an eminent merchant in the city of London; he more particularly diſtinguiſhed himſelf by an application to the direction of the affairs of the Eaſt-India Company, and his earneſt attention to whatever might promote the extenſive commerce of this nation, or ſtrengthen the foreign colonies. In this quality, we find him one of the commiſſioners employed in the negociation and concluſion of a treaty with the Dutch Eaſt-India com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by which the Molucca Iſlands and the commerce to them, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be two-thirds belonging to the Dutch Eaſt-India company, and one to the Engliſh. This treaty was concluded at London on the 17th of July, 1619, and ratified by the king the 16th of the ſame month, and is as remarkable a tranſaction as any in that reign. It was in conſequence of this treaty, and in order to recover the goods of ſome Engliſh merchants, that Sir Dudley Diggs and Maurice Abbot were ſent over to Holland in the ſucceeding year 1620; but with what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs does not appear. He was afterwards one of the farmers of the cuſtoms, as appears from a commiſſion granted in 1623 to him and to many other perſons, for adminiſtering the oaths to ſuch perſons as ſhould either deſire to paſs the ſeas from this kingdom, or to enter it from foreign countries. In the ſucceeding year 1624, he was appointed one of the council for ſettling and eſtabliſhing the colony of Virginia, with very full powers for the government of that colony, as by that commiſſion appears.</p>
            <p>On the acceſſion of King Charles I. to the throne, Mr. Abbot was the firſt perſon upon whom he conferred the honour of knighthood; and ſo great was his intereſt at that time in the city, that we find him choſen to the firſt parliament called in that king's reign, viz. in 1625, in conjunction with Sir Thomas Middleton, Sir Heneage Finch, and Mr. Robert Bateman; in 1627 he was one of the ſheriffs of London with Henry Garway, Sir Cuthbert Hacket being then mayor. About the year 1635, he erected a noble monument to the memory of his brother George, archbiſhop of Canterbury, in his native town of Guilford: in 1638 he was lord mayor of London; and died on the tenth of January 1640.—He was a great lover and encourager of trade, as well as very fortunate therein.</p>

            <head>ABBOT (ROBERT),</head>
            <p>BROTHER to the two former, was alſo born at Guilford, anno 1560, and bred up under the ſame ſchool-maſter, from whence he was ſent to Baliol College, Oxford, in 1575. He took his maſter's degree in 1582, and became a noted preacher there, alſo a conſtant lecturer at St. Martin's church in the Quadrivium, and ſometimes at Abingdon. His preferment was chiefly owing to his excellence in preaching. Notwithſtanding the diſtinction which ſome wiſh to make between the talents and tempers of theſe two brothers:—that George was the more plauſible preacher, Robert the greater ſcholar; George the abler ſtateſman, Robert the deeper divine; that gravity did frown in George and ſmile in Robert. Such were the qualities of this Robert, that upon the firſt ſermon he preached at Worceſter, he was made lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer in that city, and ſoon after rector of All Saints there: and upon a ſermon preached at Paul's-Croſs, he was preſented to the rich benefice of Bingham, in Nottinghamſhire, by one of the auditors, John Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope, Eſq. as Dr. Featly has obſerved in his life. In 1594 he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came no leſs eminent for ſome of his writings, particularly againſt a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain papiſt on the Sacrament; he then took his degrees in divinity, that of doctor being completed in 1597. In the beginning of the reign of King James I. he was made chaplain in ordinary to him; and this king ſo much eſteemed his writings, that when the ſecond edition of Dr. Abbot's book De Antichriſto was publiſhed in 1608, his majeſty or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his own Commentary upon part of the Apocalypſe to be printed, an honour which that king did to no other of the great clerks in this kingdom: and in truth the doctor's pen had now brought him alſo into general eſteem; for what he had hitherto publiſhed in defence of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Perkins's Reformed Catholic, againſt Dr. William Biſhop, now a ſecular, but afterwards, in the pope's ſtyle, a titular biſhop of the aërial dioceſe of Chalcedon. It is our author's aſſertion, that Dr. Abbot has herein given this William Biſhop as great an overthrow as Jewell to Harding, Bilſon to Allen, or Reynolds to Hart. At the end of this excellent work is added, a particular Treatiſe which he ſoon after wrote, intitled, The True Ancient Roman Catholic, which he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Prince Henry, to whom it was ſo acceptable that he returned him many thanks in a letter written with his own hand, and promiſed his aſſiſtance upon the next vacancy to advance him higher in the church; and though by that prince's untimely death, the doctor loſt ſome hopes, yet in the courſe of time his deſerts found other friends to do him that juſtice. In 1609 he was unanimouſly elected maſter of Baliol College; here it is obſerved of him, that he was careful and ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0613800301:28"/>
to ſet in his nurſery the beſt plants, and then took ſuch care to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and prune them, that in no plat or knot throughout the univerſity of Oxford there appeared more beautiful flowers, or grew ſweeter fruit than in Baliol College, while he was maſter. His diligent read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſcholars, and his continual preſence at public exerciſes, both countenanced the readers and encouraged the hearers. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations and improvements he rendered effectual, by eſtabliſhing piety, which had been much neglected, reſtoring peace, which had been long wanted, and making temperance more familiar among them, which had been too great a ſtranger in that ſociety. In May 1610 we find him nominated by the king among the firſt fellows of his majeſty's royal college at Chelſea, then newly founded, and deſigned as a kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs for controverſial divinity, being thus as it were engarriſoned with the moſt able and ſelect champions for the proteſtant cauſe, againſt all aſſertors of popery. In November the ſame year, he was made preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of Normanton, in the church of Southwell. Upon his preaching a ſermon before the king, during his month of waiting at court in 1612, when the news of Dr. Thomas Holland's death was brought from Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, his majeſty named him ſucceſſor in the theological chair, uſually called the king's profeſſor of divinity; but he modeſtly refuſed the ſame, till his brother procured a mandate from the king for him to hold it. Some remarkable circumſtances we meet with of him in this ſtation, and herein he has had the character given him of a profound divine, moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably read in the fathers, councils, and ſchoolmen, and a more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Calviniſt than either of his two predeceſſors in the divinity chair, Holland and Humphrey, which he expreſſed by countenancing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſarian way of predeſtination. Laſtly, upon the king's peruſal of his Antilogia againſt the Apology for Garnet; and the ſame of his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Lectures in the univerſity, upon the king's ſupreme power againſt Bellarmine and Suarez (printed after his death), his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, when the ſee of Saliſbury fell void, ſent his congé d'elire for him to the dean and chapter:—thus, as he ſet forward one foot on the temple of honour, though indeed but leiſurely, which is imputed to his own humility, the obſtruction of his foes who traduced him for a puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan (though cordial to the doctrine of the church of England), and to the unwillingneſs of ſome friends to adorn the church with the ſpoil of the univerſity, and mar a profeſſor to make a biſhop. He was conſecrated by his own brother the archbiſhop on December 3, 1615, in his chapel at Lambeth; herein equalizing the felicity of Seffridus, ſome time Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Chicheſter, who being a biſhop himſelf, alſo ſaw his brother at the ſame time Archbiſhop of Canterbury. Other biſhopricks were talked of for him, but the buſineſs of the nullity (before-mentioned in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's life), made a nullity for a time, ſays our author, in his grace's
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0613800301:29"/>
good intentions, inſomuch that King James, when the doctor, who was newly conſecrated Biſhop of Sarum, came to do his homage, ſaid pleaſantly to him, Abbot, I have had very much to do to make thee a biſhop, but I know no reaſon for it, unleſs it were becauſe thou haſt written againſt one, alluding to the papiſh prieſt beforementioned. In his way to Sarum he made a farewel oration at the univerſity, with great applauſe. We have ſome fragments of it preſerved in the original Latin by two authors, and a tranſlation thereof or epitome in Engliſh, by a third. His brethren, the heads of houſes, and other Oxford friends, parted with him on the edge of his dioceſe, with tears of grief; and the gentry of Sarum received him with thoſe of joy. He obſerved the beautiful old cathedral to be much decayed through negligence, and the covetouſneſs of thoſe who filled their purſes with that money which ſhould have been applied to its repairs: he therefore uſed ſuch means with the prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as drew from them five hundred pounds, which he applied to the reparation of this church, and then laboured to amend the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both by doctrine and diſcipline, viſiting his whole dioceſe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and preaching every Sabbath day, whilſt his health would permit, which was not long, for that ſedentary courſe to which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed himſelf, by cloſe application to ſtudy, brought upon him the gravel and ſtone; but in all the bodily tortures of his laſt fit, his ſoul was at eaſe, and his heavenly hopes diſpoſed him contentedly to reſign all earthly enjoyments.—He was ſo far from needing the advice of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to make the remainder of life ſupportable, that he gave it to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even to the judges, who in their circuit came to viſit him on his death bed, he ſpared not his chriſtian admonitions; and beſides his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, gave them an example of the comforts that flowed from a clear conſcience. And for the inhabitants, he mourned leſs to leave the world than they to part with him, who had ſo much endeared himſelf to them, by diligence in his paſtoral charge, by his hoſpitality and bounty to the poor, and humble carriage to all: having ſummoned his domeſtics, with deſire to declare his faith, he was perſuaded to refrain, it being manifeſt in his writings. Thus, being quite worn out with exhortations, benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the pains of diſeaſe, he lay a while in a ſlumbering ſtate, and at length, with eyes and hands uplifted for ſome ſpace, departed this life on March 2, 1617, (and not, as ſome have miſtaken, the year after) in the 58th year of his age, and before he had completely filled this ſee two years and three months; being one of the five biſhops which Saliſbury ſaw in ſix years. He was buried oppoſite the biſhop's ſeat in the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral. He was twice married, the laſt time with ſome diſpleaſure to the archbiſhop, about half a year after his promotion to the ſaid ſee. He left one ſon or more, alſo one daughter, named Martha, who was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0613800301:30"/>
married to Sir Nathaniel Brent, warden of Merton College, in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; their daughter Margaret married Dr. Edward Corbet, rector of Haſely, in Oxfordſhire, who gave ſome of the biſhop's MSS. to the Bodleian Library.</p>
            <p>There was likewiſe another Robert Abbot, a miniſter, and author alſo of ſeveral devout pieces, who, though he was ſcarcely a writer before Biſhop Abbot died, is yet here mentioned, that ſome readers may not confound him with this Biſhop of Saliſbury; as others have divided him into three diſtinct perſons, becauſe ſo many different livings are mentioned to his name in his books; never conſidering that one man might, by removal, ſucceſſively enjoy them all, as was the caſe here; that Robert Abbot being firſt beneficed in Kent, afterwards in Hampſhire, and laſtly in London.</p>

            <head>ABELARD (PETER).</head>
            <p>One of the moſt famous doctors of the twelfth century, was born at Palais near Nantz, in Britany: he was well learned in divinity, philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and the languages; but was particularly diſtinguiſhed by his ſkill in logic, and fondneſs for diſputations, which led him to travel into ſeveral provinces in order to give public proofs of his acuteneſs in that ſcience.</p>
            <p>After having baffled many antagoniſts, he read lectures in divinity with great applauſe at Paris; where he boarded with a canon whoſe name was Fulbert, and who had a very beautiful niece named Heloiſe. The canon ardently wiſhed to ſee this young lady make a figure among the learned, and Abelard was made her preceptor: but inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing her in the ſciences, he taught her to love. Abelard now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his public functions very coldly, and wrote nothing but amorous verſes. Heloiſe proving with child, Abelard ſent her to a ſiſter of his in Britany, where ſhe was delivered of a ſon. To ſoften the canon's anger, he offered to marry Heloiſe privately; and the old man was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed with the propoſal than the niece; who, from a ſingular exceſs of paſſion, choſe to be Abelard's miſtreſe rather than his wife. She married, however; but uſed often to proteſt upon oath that ſhe was ſingle, which provoked the canon to uſe her ill. Upon this, Abelard ſent her to the monaſtery of Argenteuil; where ſhe put on a religious habit, but did not take the veil. Heloiſe's relations conſidering this as a ſecond treachery, hired ruffians who, forcing into his chamber in the dead of the night, emaſculated him. This infamous treatment made him fly to the gloom of a cloiſter. He aſſumed the monaſtic habit in the abbey of St. Dennis; but the diſorders of that houſe ſoon drove him from thence. He was afterwards charged with hereſy; but after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0613800301:31"/>
perſecutions for his religious ſentiments, he ſettled in a ſolitude in the dioceſe of Troies, where he built an oratory, to which he gave the name of the Paraclet. He was afterwards choſen ſuperior of the abbey of Ruis in the dioceſe of Vannes: when the nuns being expelled from the nunnery in which Heloiſe had been placed, he gave her his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; where ſhe ſettled with ſome of her ſiſter nuns, and became their prioreſs.</p>
            <p>Abelard mixed the philoſophy of Ariſtotle with his divinity, and in 1140 was condemned by the council of Rheims and Sens. Pope Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent II. ordered him to be impriſoned, his books to be burnt, and forbade him ever teaching again. However, he was ſoon after pardoned, at the ſolicitation of Peter the Venerable, who received him into his abbey of Clugni, where he led an exemplary life. He died in the priory of Marcellus at Chalons, April 21, 1142, aged ſixty-three. His corpſe was ſent to Heloiſe, who buried it in the Paraclet. He left ſeveral works: the moſt celebrated of which are thoſe tender letters that paſſed between him and Heloiſe, with the account of their misfortunes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed; which have been tranſlated into Engliſh, and immortalized by the harmony of Mr. Pope's numbers.</p>

Euſebius, who believed that this letter was genuine, and alſo an anſwer our Saviour is ſaid to have returned to it, has tranſlated them both from the Syriac, and aſſerts that they were taken out of the archives of the city of Edeſſa. The firſt is as follows:
<q rend="inline">"Abgarus, prince of Edeſſa, to Jeſus the holy Saviour, who hath appeared in the fleſh in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Jeruſalem, greeting. I have heard of thee, and of the cures thou haſt wrought without medicines or herbs. For it is reported thou makeſt the blind to ſee, the lame to walk, lepers to be clean, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and unclean ſpirits to be expelled, ſuch as have been long diſeaſed to be healed, and the dead to be raiſed; all which when I heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee, I concluded with myſelf, That either thou waſt a God come down from heaven, or the ſon of God ſent to do theſe things.

<q rend="inline">Bleſſed art thou, O Abgarus! who haſt believed in me whom thou haſt not ſeen; for the Scriptures ſay of me, They who have ſeen me have not believed in me, that they who have not ſeen, may, by believing, have life.

            <head>ACCIUS.</head>
            <p>A LATIN tragic poet, the ſon of a freedman, and, according to St. Jerom, born in the conſulſhip of Hoſtilius Mancinus and Attilius Serranus, in the year of Rome 583; but there appears ſomewhat of confuſion or perplexity in this chronology. He made himſelf known before the death of Pacuvius, a dramatic piece of his being exhibited the ſame year that Pacuvius brought one upon the ſtage, the latter being then eighty years of age, and Accius only thirty. We do not know the name of this piece of Accius's, but the titles of ſeveral of his tragedies are mentioned by various authors. He wrote on the moſt celebrated ſtories which had been repreſented on the Athenian ſtage; as Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mache, Andromeda, Atreus, Clytemneſtra, Medea, Meleager, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletes, the civil wars of Thebes, Tereus, the Troades, &amp;c. He did not always, however, take his ſubjects from the Grecian ſtory; for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed one dramatic piece wholly Roman: it was intitled Brutus, and related to the expulſion of the Tarquins. It is affirmed by ſome, that he alſo wrote comedies; which is not unlikely, if he was the author of two pieces, the Wedding and the Merchant, which have been aſcribed to him. He did not confine himſelf to dramatic writing; for he left other productions, particularly his annals, mentioned by Macrobius, Priſcian, Feſtus, and Nonius Marcellus. He has been cenſured for writing in too harſh a ſtyle. But in all other reſpects has been eſteemed a very great poet. He was ſo much eſteemed by the public, that a comedian was puniſhed for only mentioning his name upon the ſtage. Cicero ſpeaks in great deriſion of one Accius who had written a hiſtory; and, as our author had wrote annals, ſome inſiſt that he is the perſon cenſured: but as Cicero himſelf, Horace, Quintilian, Ovid, and Paterculus, have ſpoken of our author with ſo much applauſe, we cannot think it is him whom the Roman orator cenſures with ſo much ſeverity.</p>
            <p>There was alſo in this age a pretty good orator of the ſame name, againſt whom Cicero defended Cluentius. He was born in Piſaurum, and perhaps was a relation of our poet.</p>

heel by which ſhe held him. But this opinion is not univerſal, nor is it a part of his character as drawn by Homer; for in the Iliad (B. xxi. 161.) he is actually wounded in the right arm, by the lance of Aſteropaus, in the battle near the Scamander. Thetis afterwards intruſted him to the care of the centaur Chiron, who, to give him the ſtrength neceſſary for martial toil, fed him with honey and the marrow of lions and wild boars. To prevent his going to the ſiege of Troy, ſhe diſguiſed him in female apparel, and hid him among the maidens at the court of king Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes: but Ulyſſes diſcovering him, perſuaded him to follow the Greeks. Achilles diſtinguiſhed himſelf by a number of heroic actions at the ſiege. Being diſguſted, however, with Agamemnon for the loſs of Briſeis, he retired from the camp. But returning to avenge the death of his friend Patroclus, he ſlew Hector, faſtened his corpſe to his chariot, and dragged it round the walls of Troy. At laſt Paris, the brother of Hector, wounded him in the heel with an arrow, while he was in the temple treating about his marriage with Philoxena, daughter to king Priam. Of this wound he died, and was interred on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montary of Sigaeum; and after Troy was taken, the Greeks ſacrificed Philoxena on his tomb, in obedience to his deſire, that he might enjoy her company in the Elyſian fields.

Here he remained a conſiderable time, in expectation of ſome employment; but nothing offering, he turned Roman-catholic, and was choſen rector of a ſchool at Nieſſa. It is related, that about four months after, as he was following a proceſſion of the hoſt, he was ſeized with a ſudden phrenzy; and being carried home, expired in a very ſhort time. But Thuanus tell us, that his exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive application to ſtudy was the occaſion of his untimely death; and that his ſitting up at night in compoſing his Conjectures on Plautus, brought upon him a diſtemper which carried him off in three days, on the 25th of May, 1595, being juſt turned of 28.

A little piece, printed in 1595, under the title of <hi>Mulieres non eſſe homines,</hi> "That women were not of the human ſpecies," was falſely aſcribed to him. But the fact was, that Acidalius happening to meet with the manuſcript, and thinking it very whimſical, tranſcribed it, and give it to the bookſeller, who printed it.

            <p>A SPANISH Jeſuit, born at Burgos. He was admitted into the ſociety in 1612, being then but 15 years of age. After having devoted ſome years to ſtudy, he went to America, where he aſſiſted in making converts in Chili and Peru. In 1640, he returned to Spain, and gave the king an account how far he had ſucceeded in the commiſſion he had received to make diſcoveries on the river of the Amazons; and the year following he publiſhed a deſcription of this river, at Madrid. Acuna was ſent to Rome as procurator of his province. He returned to Spain with the title of Qualificator of the Inquiſition; but ſoon after embarked again for the Weſt Indies, and was at Lima in 1675, when father Southwell publiſhed at Rome the Bibliotheque of the Jeſuit writers. Acuna's work is intitled, <hi>Nuevo deſcubrimento del gran rio de las Amazonas; i. e.</hi> "A new diſcovery of the great river of the Amazons." He was ten months upon this river, having had inſtructions to inquire into every thing with the greateſt exactneſs, that his majeſty might thereby be enabled to render the navigation more eaſy and commodious. He went aboard a ſhip at Quito, with Peter Texiera, who had already been far up the river, and was therefore thought a proper perſon to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him in this expedition. They embarked in February 1639, but did not arrive, at Para till the December following. It is thought that the revolutions of Portugal, by which the Spaniards loſt Brazil, and the colony of Para at the mouth of the river of the Amazons, were the cauſes that the relation of this Jeſuit was ſuppreſſed; for as it could not be of any advantage to the Spaniards, they were afraid it might prove of great ſervice to the Portugueſe. The copies of this work became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſcarce, ſo that the publiſhers of the French tranſlations at Paris aſſerted, that there was not one copy of the original extant, excepting that in the poſſeſſion of the tranſlator; and, perhaps, one in the Vatican library. M. de Gomberville was the author of this tranſlation: it was publiſhed after his death, with a long diſſertation.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0613800301:37"/>
public affairs—This ſhews he muſt have been opulent. He made himſelf complete maſter of the cuſtoms and uſages, rights and privileges, of the city of London, and ſucceeded to every honour his fellow-citizens had it in their power to beſtow. He was choſen maſter of the drapers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, alderman, and preſident of Saint Thomas's hoſpital, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution he probably ſaved from ruin, by diſcovering the frauds of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt ſteward. He was often returned member of parliament; but the violent politics of the times would not permit him to ſit there. In 1645 he was elected mayor of London, in which office he gave a ſhining example of diſintereſtedneſs, by declining the advantages uſually made by the ſale of places which become vacant. His loyalty to Charles I. was ſo well known, that his houſe was ſearched by the republican party to find the king there. Mr. Adams was the next year committed to the Tower by the ſame party, and detained there ſome time. However, at length he became the oldeſt alderman upon the bench, and was conſequently dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with the honourable title of Father of the City. His affection for his prince was ſo great, that during the exile of Charles II. he remitted him 10,000l.</p>
            <p>When the reſtoration of the king was agreed on, Mr. Adams, then ſeventy-four years of age, was deputed by the city to accompany Gen. Monk to Breda in Holland, to congratulate and accompany the king home. For his ſignal ſervices the king knighted him at the Hague; and ſoon after the reſtoration advanced him to the dignity of a baronet, on the 13th of June 1661.</p>
            <p>His merit as a benefactor to the public is highly conſpicuous: he gave the houſe of his nativity, at Wem, as a free-ſchool to the town, and liberally endowed it; he founded an Arabic profeſſorſhip at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge; both which took place before his death. By deſire of his friend, Mr. Wheelock, fellow of Clare-hall, he was at the expence of printing the Goſpels in Perſian, and ſending them into the Eaſt. He was equally benevolent in private as in public life; his hands were open to all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in want: and although he ſuffered great loſſes in his eſtate, he gave liberally in legacies to the poor of many pariſhes, to hoſpitals, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters' widows.

            <p>ARCHBISHOP of St. Andrew's, was born March 15, 1543, in the town of Perth, of mean but honeſt parents, who gave him all the learning they were able, having him educated at a grammar-ſchool where they dwelt, and ſent him from thence to St. Andrew's, where he acquired the degree of maſter of arts. Their circumſtances not permitting them to keep him longer there, he removed to a little village of Fife, where he taught a ſchool with reputation, and continued four years; when he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the ſon of Mr. M'Gill, of Rankellar, one of the ſenators of the college of juſtice, to Paris in 1566, to ſtudy the civil law. Here he publiſhed a congratulatory poem on the birth of a ſon to Mary queen of Scots, wherein he ſtyles Henry Lord Darnley, king of Scotland, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and France. The giving the title of king of France and England to his own prince ſo much alarmed the French court, that he was thrown into priſon, and would not eaſily have eſcaped, had not his queen, and the firſt nobility of the kingdom, intereſted themſelves in his behalf. As ſoon as he was at large, he retired with his pupil to Bourges, where they both entered ſtudents at law. He was in that city during the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of Paris; and as the ſame ſcene was tranſacting there, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to conceal himſelf at a public houſe for ſeven months. Here he wrote two excellent pieces in Latin verſe, which are ſtill extant. In 1573, he returned to Scotland, and married. Finding no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the law, he entered into holy orders, and became miniſter of Paiſley.</p>
            <p>In a general aſſembly, held the ſucceeding year at Edinburgh, he, with Mr. David Lindſay, were appointed to report their proceedings to the Earl of Morton, then regent; and was by that nobleman, in the ſame year, appointed one of his chaplains; who in the ſame year, on the death of Biſhop Douglas, raiſed him to be archbiſhop of St. Andrew's, a dignity in which he experienced nothing but trouble and uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>On October 24, 1576, the general aſſembly ſat, and required Mr. Adamſon to ſubmit himſelf to their examination, and to receive the office of biſhop with ſuch limitations as they thought fit. This he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; and they forbad the chapter of St. Andrew's to proceed to any election. The chapter, however, after the aſſembly roſe, elected Mr. Adamſon. Next year the aſſembly appointed commiſſioners to ſummon the archbiſhop before them to examine the validity of the election, and to take cognizance of various charges brought againſt him. The preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0613800301:39"/>
party ran high againſt him, and the unfortunate prelate, to ſoothe the paſſions of theſe angry men, compoſed a catechiſm in Latin verſe. This they ſaw and approved, but ſtill continued to perſecute him. In 1578, he ſubmitted himſelf to the general aſſembly; but next year a new commiſſion was iſſued to inquire into freſh charges againſt him, when he retired to St. Andrew's, and continued diſputing with them for ſome years, being preſerved from deſtruction by the power of the court.</p>
            <p>In 1582, he was ſeized with a diſtemper, which his phyſicians could not find out, and therefore could not afford him relief. He applied then to an old woman, who did him ſome ſervice; but ſo infatuated were his enemies, that they accuſed the poor woman of witchcraft, who was committed to priſon, but made her eſcape. Four years after ſhe was taken at Edinburgh, and was abſolutely burned for what ſhe ought to have been rewarded, the ſaving the archbiſhop's life.</p>
            <p>In 1583, he preached and diſputed before King James when he went to St. Andrew's, and the king was ſo well ſatisfied with his wiſdom and loyalty, that he ſent him as his ambaſſador to London to Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, in which quality he reſided ſome years. His conduct, while there, has been variouſly ſpoken of. However, by his preaching, he drew ſuch large congregations, and raiſed in the minds of the people ſuch an idea of the young king his maſter, that Elizabeth prohibited his entering the pulpit. Two things he principally endeavoured to effect, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the king his maſter to the nobility and gentry of England, and to procure ſome ſupport for the epiſcopal party in Scotland; in both which he in ſome degree ſucceeded. But his want of economy prevented his full ſucceſs. This drew on him the reflections of his enemies. As to his being concerned in Throgmorton's conſpiracy, no ſubſtantial proof of it has been brought.</p>
            <p>Soon after Gourie's conſpiracy he was recalled, and ſat in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at Edinburgh in 1584. The act therein made for ſettling the peace of the kingdom, and eſtabliſhing the king's authority in eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical affairs, had but little effect; the miniſters refuſed obedience; and becauſe the archbiſhop preached before the king, libels were publiſhed againſt him; and notwithſtanding a declaration publiſhed by the king, ſetting forth the reaſons which induced him to enact thoſe laws, the kirk faction were ſo obſtinate and indefatigable as to oblige the king to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow his declaration.</p>
            <p>At a provincial ſynod in 1586, the archbiſhop was accuſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. He appealed to the king and ſtates of the kingdom, and in return excommunicated Mr. Melvil, the moderator. The mob were ſo enraged at this, that he dared not appear as moderator. At the next aſſembly in the ſame year he ſubmitted, and was abſolved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0613800301:40"/>In 1587, complaint was made to the general aſſembly, and he was actually <hi>put to the horn,</hi> that is, outlawed, becauſe he did not pay his debts. In 1588. he was accuſed of marrying the Earl of Huntley with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out requiring him to ſubſcribe a confeſſion of faith. He publiſhed ſoon after the Lamentations of the prophet Jeremiah in Latin verſe, and a tranſlation of the Apocalypſe alſo in Latin verſe; but neither thoſe, or a copy of verſes written to the king when in deep diſtreſs, could procure him any favour. On the contrary, the king finding him no longer of uſe to him, granted the revenue of his ſee to the Duke of Lenox. This reduced him to greater diſtreſs, and the brethren taking advantage of it, procured his ſubſcription to a moſt abject ſubmiſſion by giving him a poor collection for the immediate ſupport of his family. In this ſtate he lingered till 1591, when death put a period to his misfortunes.</p>

He received the firſt tincture of letters at the grammar-ſchool at Appleby, and in 1650 was ſent to Queen's college, Oxford, where he became firſt a poor child on the foundation; but quickly diſtinguiſhing himſelf by his lively parts and ſtrict application to learning, in 1654 he was admitted bachelor, and in 1657 maſter of arts; and being then much noticed for his ſprightly wit, was made choice of for one of the <hi>Terrae Filii</hi> for the act celebrated in 1658. But his loyalty getting the better of his prudence, in his oration he was ſo ſevere on the pride, hypocriſy, ignorance, and avarice of thoſe in power, that he was compelled to make a recantation, and aſk pardon on his knees. Shortly after he left the univerſity: he choſe for his retreat the village of Petworth, and ſpent his time in viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gentlemen of known loyalty, who had ſeats in the county of Suſſex, where he endeavoured to promote among the youth principles of loyalty.</p>
            <p>On the reſtoration, the gentlemen of that county recommended him to Dr. King, biſhop of Chicheſter, as a man of a ſound head and honeſt heart, and one who had ſuffered much for the conſtitution in church and ſtate.

The preferments he now enjoyed enabled him to live decently and hoſpitably in the country, where he diſcharged his duty with a conſcientious diligence, and lived on terms of friendſhip with the moſt eminent perſons in the neighbourhood.</p>

            <p>SON of Dean Addiſon, the ſubject of the laſt article. He was born at Milſton, near Ambreſbury, in Wiltſhire, on the 11th of May 1672; and not being thought likely to live, was baptized the ſame day. He received the firſt rudiments of his education at the place of his nativity, under the reverend Mr. Naiſh; but was ſoon removed to Saliſbury, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of Mr. Taylor; and from thence to the Charter-houſe,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0613800301:42"/>
where he commenced his acquaintance with Sir Richard Steele. About fifteen, he was entered at Queen's college, Oxford, where he applied very cloſely to the ſtudy of claſſical learning, in which he made a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing proficiency.</p>
            <p>In the year 1687, Dr. Lancaſter, dean of Magdalen college, having by ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e ſeen a Latin poem of Mr. Addiſon's, was ſo pleaſed with it, that he immediately got him elected into that houſe, where he took his degrees of bachelor and maſter of arts. His Latin pieces in the courſe of a few years were exceedingly admired in both univerſities; nor were they leſs eſteemed abroad, particularly by the celebrated Boileau, who is reported to have ſaid, that he would not have written againſt Perrault, had he before ſeen ſuch excellent pieces by a modern hand. He publiſhed nothing in Engliſh before the twenty-ſecond year of his age; when there appeared a ſhort copy of verſes written by him, and addreſſed to Mr. Dryden, which procured him great reputation from the beſt judges. This was ſoon followed by a tranſlation of the Fourth Georgic of Virgil (omitting the ſtory of Ariſtaeus), much commended by Mr. Dryden. He wrote alſo the Eſſay on the Georgics, prefixed to Mr. Dryden's tranſlation. There are ſeveral other pieces written by him about this time; amongſt the reſt, one dated the 3d of April 1694, addreſſed to H. S. that is, Dr. Sacheverell, who became afterwards ſo famous, and with whom Mr. Addiſon lived once in the greateſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but their intimacy was ſome time after broken off by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement in political principles. In the year 1695, he wrote a poem to King William on one of his campaigns, addreſſed to Sir John Somers, lord keeper of the great ſeal. This gentleman received it with great pleaſure, took the author into the number of his friends, and beſtowed on him many marks of his favour.</p>
            <p>Mr. Addiſon had been cloſely preſſed, while at the univerſity, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into holy orders; and had once reſolved upon it: but his great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, his natural diffidence, and an uncommonly delicate ſenſe of the importance of the ſacred function, made him afterwards alter his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and having expreſſed an inclination to travel, he was encouraged thereto by his patron abovementioned, who by his intereſt procured him from the crown a penſion of 300l. <hi>per annum</hi> to ſupport him in his travels. He accordingly made a tour to Italy in the year 1699; and, in 1701, he wrote a poetical epiſtle from Italy to the Earl of Halifax, which has been univerſally eſteemed as a moſt excellent performance. It was tranſlated into Italian verſe by the Abbot Antonio Maria Salvini, Greek profeſſor at Florence. In the year 1705, he publiſhed an account of his travels, dedicated to Lord Somers; which, though at firſt but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently received, yet in a little time met with its deſerved applauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0613800301:43"/>In the year 1702, he was about to return to England, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived advice of his being appointed to attend Prince Eugene, who then commanded for the emperor in Italy: but the death of king William happening ſoon after, put an end to this affair as well as his penſion; and he remained for a conſiderable time unemployed. An unexpected incident at once raiſed him, and gave him an opportunity of exerting his fine talents to advantage: for in the year 1704, the lord treaſurer Godolphin happened to complain to Lord Halifax, that the Duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim had not been celebrated in verſe in the manner it deſerved; and intimated, that he would take it kindly, if his lordſhip, who was the known patron of the poets, would name a gentleman capable of doing juſtice to ſo elevated a ſubject. Lord Halifax replied, ſomewhat haſtily, that he did know ſuch a perſon, but would not mention him; adding, that long had he ſeen, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, men of no merit maintained in luxury at the public expence, whilſt thoſe of real worth and modeſty were ſuffered to languiſh in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. The treaſurer anſwered very coolly, that he was ſorry there ſhould be occaſion for ſuch an obſervation, but that he would do his endeavour to wipe off ſuch reproaches for the future; and he engaged his honour, that whoever his lordſhip named, as a perſon capable of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating this victory, ſhould meet with a ſuitable recompence. Lord Halifax thereupon named Mr. Addiſon; inſiſting, however, that the treaſurer himſelf ſhould ſend to him; which he promiſed. Accordingly he prevailed on Mr. Boyle (afterwards Lord Carlton) then chancellor of the exchequer, to make the propoſal to Mr. Addiſon; which he did in ſo polite a manner, that our author readily undertook the taſk. The lord treaſurer had a ſight of the piece, when it was carried no farther than the celebrated ſimile of the angel; and was ſo pleaſed with it, that he immediately appointed Mr. Addiſon a commiſſioner of appeals, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant by the promotion of Mr. Locke, choſen one of the lords commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for trade. The Campaign is addreſſed to the Duke of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough; it gives a ſhort view of the military tranſactions in 1704, and contains a noble deſcription of the two great actions at Schellemberg and Blenheim. In 1705, he attended Lord Halifax to Hanover; and the enſuing year was appointed under-ſecretary to Sir Charles Hedges, ſecretary of ſtate; in which office he acquitted himſelf ſo well, that the Earl of Sunderland, who ſucceeded Sir Charles in December, continued Mr. Addiſon in his employment.</p>
            <p>A taſte for operas beginning at this time to prevail in England, and many perſons having ſolicited Mr. Addiſon to write one, he complied with their requeſt, and compoſed his Roſamond. This, however, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the defect of the muſic, or from the prejudices in favour of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0613800301:44"/>
the Italian taſte, did not ſucceed upon the ſtage; but the poetry of it has, and always will be, juſtly admired. About this time, Sir Richard Steele compoſed his comedy of the Tender Huſband, to which Mr. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon wrote a prologue. Sir Richard ſurprized him with a dedication of this play, and acquainted the public, that he was indebted to him for ſome of the moſt excellent ſtrokes in the performance. The Marquis of Wharton, being appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1709, took Mr. Addiſon with him as his ſecretary. Her Majeſty alſo made him keeper of the records of Ireland, and, as a farther mark of her favour, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably augmented the ſalary annexed to that place. Whilſt he was in this kingdom, the Tatler was firſt publiſhed; and he diſcovered his friend Sir Richard Steele to be the author, by an obſervation on Virgil, which he had communicated to him. He afterwards aſſiſted conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in carrying on this paper, which the author acknowledges. The Tatler being laid down, the Spectator was ſet on foot, and Mr. Addiſon furniſhed great part of the moſt admired papers. The Spectator made its firſt appearance in March 1711, and was brought to a concluſion in September 1712.</p>
            <p>His celebrated Cato appeared in 1713. He formed the deſign of a tragedy upon this ſubject when he was very young, and wrote it when on his travels: he retouched it in England, without any intention of bringing it on the ſtage; but his friends being perſuaded it would ſerve the cauſe of liberty, he was prevailed on by their ſolicitations, and it was accordingly exhibited on the theatre, with a prologue by Mr. Pope, and an epilogue by Dr. Garth. It was received with the moſt uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon applauſe, having run thirty-five nights without interruption. The Whigs applauded every line in which liberty was mentioned, as a ſatire on the Tories; and the Tories echoed every clap, to ſhow that the ſatire was unfelt. When it was printed, notice was given that the queen would be pleaſed if it was dedicated to her; "but as he had deſigned that compliment elſewhere, he found himſelf obliged," ſays Tickell, "by his duty on the one hand, and his honour on the other, to ſend it into the world without any dedication." It was no leſs eſteemed abroad, having been tranſlated into French, Italian, and German; and was acted at Leghorn, and ſeveral other places, with vaſt applauſe. The Jeſuits of St. Omers made a Latin verſion of it, and the ſtudents acted it with great magnificence.</p>
            <p>About this time, another paper called the Guardian was publiſhed by Steele, to which Addiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n was a principal contributor. It was a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the Spectator, and was diſtinguiſhed by the ſame elegance and the ſame variety; but, in conſequence of Steele's propenſity to poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, was abruptly diſcontinued in order to write the Engliſhman.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0613800301:45"/>The papers of Addiſon are marked in the Spectator by one of the letters in the name of <hi>Clio,</hi> and in the Guardian by a <hi>Hand.</hi> Many of theſe papers were written with powers truly comic, with nice diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of characters, and accurate obſervation of natural or accidental deviations from propriety: but it was not ſuppoſed that he had tried a comedy on the ſtage, till Steele, after his death, declared him the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of "The Drummer." This, however, he did not know to be true by any cogent teſtimony: for when Addiſon put the play into his hands, he only told him it was the work of a gentleman in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and when it was received, as is confeſſed, with cold diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, he was probably leſs willing to claim it. Tickell omitted it in his collection; but the teſtimony of Steele, and the total ſilence of any other claimant, has determined the public to aſſign it to Addiſon, and it is now printed with his other poetry. Steele carried "The Drummer" to the playhouſe, and afterwards to the preſs, and ſold the copy for 50 guineas. To Steele's opinion may be added the proof ſupplied by the play itſelf, of which the characters are ſuch as Addiſon would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated, and the tendency ſuch as Addiſon would have promoted.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that Mr. Addiſon intended to have compoſed an Engliſh dictionary upon the plan of the Italian (Della Cruſca); but, upon the death of the queen, being appointed ſecretary to the lords juſtices, he had not leiſure to carry on ſuch a work. When the Earl of Sunderland was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland, Mr. Addiſon was again made ſecretary for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> affairs of that kingdom; and, upon the earl's being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the lieutenancy, he was choſen one of the lords of trade.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards an attempt was made to revive the Spectator, at a time indeed by no means favourable to literature, when the ſucceſſion of a new family to the throne filled the nation with anxiety, diſcord, and confuſion; and either the turbulence of the times, or the ſatiety of the readers, put a ſtop to the publication, after an experiment of 80 numbers, which were afterwards collected into an eighth volume, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more valuable than any of thoſe that went before it: Addiſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced more than a fourth part.</p>
            <p>In 1715, he began the Freeholder, a political paper, which was much admired, and proved of great uſe at that juncture. He publiſhed alſo, about this time, verſes to Sir Godfrey Kneller upon the king's picture, and ſome to the Princeſs of Wales with the tragedy of Cato.</p>
            <p>Before the arrival of King George he was made ſecretary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and was required by his office to ſend notice to Hanover that the queen was dead, and that the throne was vacant. To do this would not have been difficult to any man but Addiſon, who was ſo overwhelmed with the greatneſs of the event, and ſo diſtracted by choice of expreſſion,

that the lords, who could not wait for the niceties of criticiſm, called Mr. Southwell, a clerk in the houſe, and ordered him to diſpatch the meſſage. Southwell readily told what was neceſſary, in the common ſtyle of buſineſs, and valued himſelf upon having done what was too hard for Addiſon.</p>
            <p>In 1716, he married the Counteſs Dowager of Warwick, whom he had ſolicited by a very long and anxious courtſhip. He is ſaid to have firſt known her by becoming tutor to her ſon. The marriage, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradicted report can be credited, made no addition to his happineſs; it neither found them nor made them equal. She always remembered her own rank, and thought herſelf intitled to treat with very little cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony the tutor of her ſon. It is certain that Addiſon has left behind him no encouragement for ambitious love. The year after, 1717, he roſe to his higheſt elevation, being made ſecretary of ſtate; but is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as having proved unequal to the duties of his place. In the houſe of commons he could not ſpeak, and therefore was uſeleſs to the defence of the government. In the office he could not iſſue an order without loſing his time in queſt of fine expreſſions. At laſt, finding by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence his own inability for public buſineſs, he was forced to ſolicit his diſmiſſion, with a penſion of 1500l. a year. Such was the account of thoſe who were inclined to detract from his abilities; but by others his relinquiſhment was attributed to declining health, and the neceſſity of receſs and quiet.</p>
            <p>In his retirement, he wrote his Evidences of the Chriſtian Religion, which he had begun long before; part of which, ſcarce finiſhed, has been printed in his works. He intended alſo to have given an Engliſh paraphraſe of ſome of David's pſalms. But his ailments increaſed, and cut ſhort his deſigns. He had for ſome time been oppreſſed by an aſthmatic diſorder, which was now aggravated by a dropſy, and he prepared to die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to his precepts and profeſſions. He ſent, as Mr. Pope relates, a meſſage by the Earl of Warwick to Mr. Gay, deſiring to ſee him: Gay, who had not viſited him for ſome time before, obeyed the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and found himſelf received with great kindneſs. The purpoſe for which the interview had been ſolicited was then diſcovered: Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon told him, that he had injured him; but that, if he recovered, he would recompenſe him. What the injury was he did not explain, nor did Gay ever know; but ſuppoſed that ſome preferment deſigned for him had by Addiſon's inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> irregular life, and perhaps of looſe opinions. Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for whom he did not want reſpect, had very diligently endeavoured to reclaim him; but his arguments and expoſtulations had no effect:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0613800301:49"/>
one experiment, however, remained to be tried. When he found his life near its end, he directed the young lord to be called; and when he deſired, with great tenderneſs, to hear his laſt injunctions, told him, "I have ſent for you that you may ſee how a Chriſtian can die.' What effect this aweful ſcene had on the earl's behaviour is not known; he died himſelf in a ſhort time. Having given directions to Mr. Tickell for the publication of his works, and dedicated them on his death-bed to his friend Mr. Craggs, he died June 17, 1719, at Holland-houſe, leaving no child but a daughter who is ſtill living.</p>
            <p>Addiſon's courſe of life before his marriage has been detailed by Pope. He had in the houſe with him Budgell, and perhaps Philips. His chief companions were Steele, Budgell, Philips, Carey, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant, and Colonel Brett. With one or other of theſe he always breakfa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed. He ſtudied all morning; then dined at a tavern, and went afterwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds to Button's. From the coffee-houſe he went again to the tavern, where he often ſat late, and drank too much wine.</p>
            <p>Dr. Johnſon, in delineating the character of Addiſon, obſerves with Tickell, that he employed wit on the ſide of virtue and religion. He not only made the proper uſe of wit himſelf, but taught it to others; and from his time it has been generally ſubſervient to the cauſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and truth. He has diſſipated the prejudice that had long connected gaiety with vice, and eaſineſs of manners with laxity of principles. He reſtored virtue to its dignity, and taught innocence not to be aſhamed. This is an elevation of literary character, "above all Greek, above all Roman fame." No greater felicity can genius attain than that of having purified intellectual pleaſure, ſeparated mirth from inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and wit from licentiouſneſs; of having taught a ſucceſſion of writers to bring elegance and gaiety to the aid of goodneſs; and, to uſe expreſſions yet more aweful, "of having turned many to righteouſneſs." As a delineator of life and manners, he muſt be allowed to ſtand perhaps the firſt of the firſt rank. His humour, which, as Steele obſerves, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to himſelf, is ſo happily diffuſed, as to give the grace of novelty to domeſtic ſcenes and daily occurrences. He never "outſteps the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of nature," nor raiſes merriment or wonder by the violation of truth. His figures neither divert by diſtortion, nor amaze by aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He copies life with ſo much fidelity, that he can be hardly ſaid to invent; yet his exhibitions have an air ſo much original, that it is difficult to ſuppoſe them not merely the product of imagination. As a teacher of wiſdom he may be confidently followed. His religion has nothing in it enthuſiaſtic or ſuperſtitious; he appears neither weakly credulous nor wantonly ſceptical; his morality is neither dangerouſly lax nor impracticably rigid. All the enchantment of fancy and all the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0613800301:50"/>
cogency of argument are employed to recommend to the reader his real intereſt, the care of pleaſing the Author of his being. Truth is ſhown ſometimes as the phantom of a viſion, ſometimes appears half-veiled in an allegory; ſometimes attracts regard in the robes of fancy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſteps forth in the confidence of reaſon. She wears a thouſand dreſſes, and in all is pleaſing.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, however, has related the following anecdote, which every admirer of Addiſon, every man of feeling, muſt be reluctant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. "Steele (ſays the Doctor), whoſe imprudence of generoſity, or vanity of profuſion, kept him always incurably neceſſitous, upon ſome preſſing exigence, in an evil hour, borrowed an hundred pounds of his friend, probably without much purpoſe of repayment; but Addiſon, who ſeems to have had other notions of an hundred pounds, grew impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of delay, and reclaimed his loan by an execution. Steele felt, with great ſenſibility, the obduracy of his creditor; but with emotions of ſorrow rather than of anger." It is much to be wiſhed, ſays Dr. Kippis, that Dr. Johnſon had produced his authority for this narration. It is very poſſible, that it may be only a ſtory the Doctor had ſomewhere heard in converſation, and which is entirely groundleſs: "and this I am rather inclined to believe, as I have been aſſured, by one of the moſt reſpectable characters in the kingdom, that the fact hath no foundation in truth." Mr. Potter, in a late publication, hath informed us, that he is told by the beſt authority, that the ſtory is an abſolute falſehood.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tyers, in "An hiſtorical Eſſay on Mr. Addiſon," printed, but not publiſhed, has mentioned ſome facts concerning him, with which we were not before acquainted. Theſe are, That he was laid out for dead as ſoon as he was born: that, when he addreſſed his verſes on the Engliſh poets to Henry Sacheverell, he courted that gentleman's ſiſter: that, whenever Jacob Tonſon came to him for the Spectator, Bayle's French Hiſtorical and Critical Dictionary lay always open before him: that, upon his return to England, after his travels, he diſcharged ſome old debts he had contracted at Oxford, with the generoſity of good intereſt: that he was put into plentiful circumſtances by the death of a brother in the Eaſt Indies: that, having received encouragement from a married lady, of whom he had been formerly enamoured, he had the integrity to reſiſt the temptation: that he refuſed a gratification of a three hundred pounds bank-note, and afterwards of a diamond-ring of the ſame value, from a Major Dunbar, whom he had endeavoured to ſerve in Ireland by his intereſt with Lord Sunderland: and that his daughter by Lady Warwick is ſtill alive and unmarried, reſiding at Bilton near Rugby, and poſſeſſing an income of near twelve hundred a year.</p>
            <p>The following letter, which probably relates to the caſe of Major
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0613800301:51"/>
Dunbar, reflects great honour on Mr. Addiſon's integrity. "<hi>June</hi> 26, 1715. SIR, I find there is a very ſtrong oppoſition formed againſt you; but I ſhall wait on my lord lieutenant this morning, and lay your caſe before him as advantageouſly as I can, if he is not engaged in other company. I am afraid what you ſay of his grace does not portend you any good. And now, Sir, believe me, when I aſſure you I never did, nor ever will, on any pretence whatſoever, take more than the ſtated and cuſtomary fees of my office. I might keep the contrary practice concealed from the world, were I capable of it, but I could not from myſelf; and I hope I ſhall always fear the reproaches of my own heart more than thoſe of all mankind. In the mean time, if I can ſerve a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of merit, and ſuch a character as you bear in the world, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I meet with on ſuch an occaſion is always a ſufficient, and the only reward to, Sir, your moſt obedient, humble ſervant, J. ADDISON." —The anecdote which follows was told by the late Dr. Birch. Addiſon and Mr. Temple Stanyan were very intimate. In the familiar converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which paſſed between them, they were accuſtomed freely to diſpute each other's opinions. Upon ſome occaſion, Mr. Addiſon lent Stanyan five hundred pounds. After this, Mr. Stanyan behaved with a timid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, deference, and reſpect; not converſing with the ſame freedom as formerly, or canvaſſing his friend's ſentiments. This gave great uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Mr. Addiſon. One day they happened to fall upon a ſubject, on which Mr. Stanyan had always been uſed ſtrenuouſly to oppoſe his opinion. But, even upon this occaſion, he gave way to what his friend advanced, without interpoſing his own view of the matter. This hurt Mr. Addiſon ſo much, that he ſaid to Mr. Stanyan, "Either contradict me, or pay me the money."</p>
            <p>In Tickell's edition of Mr. Addiſon's works there are ſeveral pieces hitherto unmentioned, viz. The Diſſertation on Medals; which, though not publiſhed till after his death, yet he had collected the materials, and began to put them in order, at Vienna, in 1702. A pamphlet, intitled, The preſent State of the War, and the Neceſſity of an Augmentation, conſidered. The late Trial and Conviction of Count Tariff. The Whig Examiner came out on the 14th of September 1716: there were five of theſe papers attributed to Mr. Addiſon, and they are the ſevereſt pieces he ever wrote. He is ſaid alſo to have been the author of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance intitled <hi>Diſſertatio de inſignioribus Romanorum Poetis,</hi> and of a Diſcourſe on Ancient and Modern Learning.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0613800301:52"/>
of age, under the guardianſhip of Trajan, and Coelius Tatianus a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knight. He began to ſerve very early in the armies, having been tribune of a legion before the death of Domitian. He was the perſon choſen by the army of Lower Moeſia, to carry the news of Nerva's death to Trajan, ſucceſſor to the empire. He accompanied Trajan in moſt of his expeditions, and particularly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the ſecond war againſt the Daci; and having before been quaeſtor, as well as tribune of the people, he was ſucceſſively praetor, governor of Pannonia, and conſul. After the ſiege of Atra in Arabia was raiſed, Trajan, who had already given him the government of Syria, left him the command of the army: and at length, when he found death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, it is ſaid adopted him. Adrian, who was then in Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, as ſoon as he received the news thereof, and of Trajan's death, declared himſelf emperor, on the 11th of Auguſt, 117. No ſooner had he arrived at the imperial dignity, than he made peace with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, to whom he yielded up great part of the conqueſts of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and from generoſity, or policy, he remitted the debts of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man people, which, according to the calculation of thoſe who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to modern money, amounted to 22,500,000 golden crowns; and he burnt all the bonds and obligations relating to thoſe debts, that the people might be under no apprehenſion of being called to an account for them afterwards. There are medals in commemoration of this fact, in which he is repreſented holding a flambeau in his hand; to ſet fire to all thoſe bonds which he had made void. He went to viſit all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; and did not return to Rome till the year 118, when the ſenate decreed him a triumph, and honoured him with the title of Father of his Country; but he refuſed both, and deſired that Trajan's image might triumph. No prince travelled more than Adrian; there being hardly one province in the empire which he did not viſit. In 120 he went into Gaul; from thence he went to Britain, in order to ſubdue the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledonians, who were making continual inroads into the provinces. Upon his arrival they retired towards the north: he advanced however as far as York, where he was diverted from his intended conqueſt by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription ſome old ſoldiers he found there, who had ſerved under Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola, gave him of the country. In hopes, therefore, of keeping them quiet by enlarging their bounds, he delivered up to the Caledonians all the lands lying between the two Friths and the Tyne; and at the ſame time, to ſecure the Roman province from their future incurſions, built the famous wall which ſtill bears his name. Having thus ſettled mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Britain, he returned to Rome, where he was honoured with the title of Reſtorer of Britain, as appears by ſome medals. He ſoon after went into Spain, to Mauritania, and at length into the Eaſt, where he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0613800301:53"/>
quieted the commotions raiſed by the Parthians. After having viſited all the provinces of Aſia, he returned to Athens in 125, where he paſſed the winter, and was initiated in the myſteries of Eleuſinian Ceres. He went from thence to Sicily, chiefly to view mount Aetna, contemplate its phenomena, and enjoy the beautiful and extenſive proſpect afforded from its top. He returned to Rome the beginning of the year 129; and, according to ſome, went again the ſame year to Africa; and, after his return from thence, to the Eaſt. He was in Egypt in the year 132, reviſited Syria the year following, returned to Athens in 134, and to Rome in 135. The perſecution againſt the Chriſtians was very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent under his reign; but it was at length ſuſpended, in conſequence of the remonſtrances of Quadrat biſhop of Athens, and Ariſtides, two Chriſtian philoſophers, who preſented the emperor with ſome books in favour of the Chriſtian religion. He conquered the Jews; and, by way of inſult, erected a temple to Jupiter on Calvary, and placed a ſtatue of Adonis in the manger of Bethlehem; he cauſed alſo the images of ſwine to be engraven on the gates of Jeruſalem. At laſt he was ſeized with a dropſy, which tormented him to ſuch a degree, that he became almoſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mad. A great number of phyſicians were ſent for, and to the multitude of them he aſcribed his death. He died at Baiae in the 63d year of his age, having reigned 21 years. The Latin verſes he addreſſed to his ſoul have been much criticiſed and variouſly interpreted. There are ſome fragments of his Latin poems extant, and there are Greek verſes of his in the Anthology. He alſo wrote the hiſtory of his own life: to which, however, he did not chooſe to put his name; but that of Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, one of his freed-men, a very learned perſon, was prefixed to it. He had great wit, and an extenſive memory. He underſtood the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences perfectly well; but was very jealous of others who excelled in them. He was alſo cruel, envious, and laſcivious. Antoninus, his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, obtained his apotheoſis; and prevented the reſciſſion of his acts, which the ſenate once intended.</p>

            <head>ADRIAN IV. (POPE),</head>
            <p>THE only Engliſhman who ever had the honour of ſitting in the papal chair. His name was Nicholas Brekeſpere; and he was born at Langley, near St. Alban's, in Hertfordſhire. His father having left his family, and taken the habit of the monaſtery of St. Alban's, Nicholas was obliged to ſubmit to the loweſt offices in that houſe for daily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. After ſome time, he deſired to take the habit in that monaſtery, but was rejected by the Abbot Richard. Upon this he reſolved to try his fortune in another country, and accordingly went to Paris; where, though in very poor circumſtances, he applied himſelf to his ſtudies with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0613800301:54"/>
great aſſiduity, and made a wonderful proficiency. But having ſtill a ſtrong inclination to a religious life, he left Paris, and removed to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, where he became a regular clerk in the monaſtery of St. Rufus. He was not immediately allowed to take the habit; but paſſed ſome time, by way of trial, in recommending himſelf to the monks by a ſtrict attention to all their commands. This behaviour, together with the beauty of his perſon, and prudent converſation, rendered him ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to thoſe religious, that after ſome time they intreated him to take the habit of the canonical order. Here he diſtinguiſhed himſelf ſo much by his learning and ſtrict obſervance of the monaſtic diſcipline, that, upon the death of the abbot, he was choſen ſuperior of that houſe; and we are told that he rebuilt that convent. Pope Eugenius III. being appriſed of the great merit of Nicholas, and thinking he might be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the church in a higher ſtation, created him cardinal-biſhop of Alba in 1146. In 1148, his holineſs ſent him legate to Denmark and Norway; where, by his fervent preaching and diligent inſtructions, he converted thoſe barbarous nations to the Chriſtian faith; and erected Upſal into an archiepiſcopal ſee. When he returned to Rome, he was received by the pope and cardinals with great marks of honour: and Pope Anaſtaſius, who ſucceeded Eugenius, happening to die at this time, Nicholas was unanimouſly choſen to the holy ſee, in November 1154, and he took the name of <hi>Adrian.</hi> When the news of his promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reached England, King Henry II. ſent Robert, Abbot of St. Alban's, and three biſhops, to Rome, to congratulate him on his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; upon which occaſion Adrian granted very conſiderable privileges to the monaſtery of St. Alban's, particularly an exemption from all epiſcopal juriſdiction, excepting to the ſee of Rome. Adrian, in the beginning of his pontificate, boldly withſtood the attempts of the Roman people to recover their ancient liberty under the conſuls, and obliged thoſe magiſtrates to abdicate their authority, and leave the government of the city to the pope. In 1155, he drove the heretic Arnaud of Breſſe, and his followers, out of Rome. The ſame year he excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated William, king of Sicily, who ravaged the territories of the church, and abſolved that prince's ſubjects from their allegiance. About the ſame time, Frederic king of the Romans having entered Italy with a powerful army, Adrian met him near Sutrium, and concluded a peace with him. At this interview, Frederic conſented to hold the pope's ſtirrup whilſt he mounted on horſeback. After which, his holineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted that prince to Rome, and in St. Peter's church placed the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial crown on his head, to the great mortification of the Roman people, who aſſembled in a tumultuous manner, and killed ſeveral of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0613800301:55"/>
The next year a reconciliation was brought about between the pope and the Sicilian king, that prince taking an oath to do nothing farther to the prejudice of the church, and Adrian granting him the title of <hi>King of the Two Sicilies.</hi> He built and fortified ſeveral caſtles, and left the papal dominions in a more flouriſhing condition than he found them. But notwithſtanding all his ſucceſs, he was extremely ſenſible of the diſquietudes attending ſo high a ſtation; and declared to his countryman, John of Saliſbury, that all the former hardſhips of his life were mere amuſement to the misfortunes of the popedom: that he looked upon St. Peter's chair to be the moſt uneaſy ſeat in the world; and that his crown ſeemed to be clapped burning on his head. He died September 1, 1159, in the fourth year and tenth month of his pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate; and was buried in St. Peter's church, near the tomb of his predeceſſor Eugenius, There are extant ſeveral letters, and ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, written by Pope Adrian.</p>

               </gap>red, was the youngeſt ſon of Aethelwolf, king of the Weſt Saxons. He was born anno 849. His father, a wiſe and religious prince, believing that he ſaw in him a brighter and a more promiſing genius than in his other children, ſent him, when in his fifth year, to Rome, where he was adopted by Pope Leo IV. and anointed by him. This ſome conceive to have been a regal unction, others think he was only confirmed. His father, in the decline of life, paying a viſit to the Holy See, took this favourite ſon with him, which afforded him an opportunity to make great improvement.</p>
            <p>On his return to England, his parents were as fond of him as ever; but this tenderneſs was not of ſervice to Aelfrid, ſince it eſtranged him from learning, and cauſed him to indulge idleneſs and a purſuit of youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures. On his father's death, he had an appanage left him by will; but his brothers, who ſucceeded to the throne, deluded him with fair promiſes, and limited his poſſeſſions. However, his grave and philoſophic turn of mind induced him to think of recovering the time he had loſt in his nonage, which made him the more readily admit theſe excuſes, and he would have been well contented with his books and eaſe. But he was not long permitted to enjoy even theſe ſmall comforts. For the Danes invading the kingdom, he was obligated to quit a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative life for an active one. He ſerved his brothers, both with his advice and perſon, till their deaths, when he became king in his own right A. D. 871, at the age of twenty-two. He aſſumed this dignity with much reluctance, not only from his love of a retired life, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was well convinced that a crown, though adorned with jewels, was lined with cares, and often proved a heavy burthen to the wearer.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0613800301:59"/>
He had ſcarcely buried his brothers, ere he was obliged to fight for that crown he had ſo unwillingly accepted. He engaged the Daniſh army at Wilton, and had the advantage on the firſt onſet; but the Danes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his weakneſs, rallied in the purſuit, and drove him out of the field. This cannot be wondered at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we conſider that, excluſive of their inferiority in numbers, the Saxons had fought eight or nine battles that year, and muſt have been harraſſed exceſſively. Soon after this a treaty was concluded, which the Danes paid little attention to, as they continued roaming about the country, and plundering wherever they came. They at length deſtroyed the kingdom of Mercia, and forced its monarch to leave his dominions, and the iſland. The next year they acted in a manner that gave Aelfrid to underſtand he had nothing to truſt to but arms: for this reaſon he fitted out a fleet to guard the coaſts, and keep theſe rovers from landing. This deſign produced, in ſome degree, the deſired effect; for a ſquadron of Daniſh ſhips coming on the coaſt, one was taken. But a large army of Danes, commanded by ſeveral of their kings, marched as far as Grant Bridge, and quartered there the beſt part of the year. The next ſummer they advanced to Werham, where king Aelfrid met them with all the forces he could raiſe; but finding himſelf too weak to encounter them, concluded a peace; which, if ſome hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians are to be credited, was not done without the aſſiſtance of money. However, the peace was made, and the Danes ſwore never to invade his dominions. This oath, according to their uſual cuſtom, they broke in a very few months; and the year following, 876, committed freſh and great hoſtilities, which cauſed the king to march againſt them with all the forces he could get together. He found them at Exeter, where he kept them beſieged for ſome time. In the mean while, his fleet ſucceſsfully engaged the enemy at ſea; for notwithſtanding theirs conſiſted of an hundred and twenty ſail, many were ſunk, and the reſt diſperſed, which in attempting to gain ſome of the Engliſh ports, were driven by a ſtorm on the coaſts, and all periſhed The barbarians were ſo diſcouraged at this, that they made peace once more, and gave hoſtages. But in 877, having gained freſh ſupplies, they reviſited Wiltſhire in ſuch numbers, that the Saxons could not be prevailed on to make head againſt them. Many, to avoid them, fled from the kingdom; others ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and the reſt, ſuffering their fear to ſuperſede their duty, fled to the moſt likely place of ſecurity. Aelfrid no longer conceiving himſelf a king, laid aſide all ſigns of royalty; and to ſecure his perſon, took ſhelter in the houſe of a peaſant who kept his cattle. While he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this retreat, a trifling adventure occurred which is noticed by ſeveral hiſtorians. The good woman of the houſe having made ſome cakes, put them before the fire to toaſt, and ſeeing Aelfrid ſitting by, trimming
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0613800301:60"/>
his bow and arrows, ſhe made no doubt but he would take care of them; but he, it ſeems, intent on what he was about, let the cakes burn, which ſo enraged the woman, that ſhe ſcolded him ſeverely, telling him that he would be glad to eat them, and therefore ought to have looked after them. The king, however, did not long remain in this deplorable ſituation; for obſerving that a part of Somerſetſhire was ſo incloſed by the waters of the Perrot and the Thone, as to form a moraſs, which it was almoſt impracticable to force, he built a fort in the center, where there were about two acres of firm ground, for the ſecurity of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his family, and a few faithful ſervants who repaired thither to him. This place he named Aethelingey, or rather Aethelinga-igge, that is, the <hi>Iſle of Nobles,</hi> now called Athelney. He continued there ſome months, frequently ſallying out upon the Danes with incredible ſecreſy and ſucceſs. When he had ſpent almoſt a year in this manner, he learnt that ſome of his ſubjects had routed a great army of Danes, killed their chiefs or kings, and taken their magical ſtandard. He then iſſued out letters to acquaint them with the place where he was, and to invite the nobility to come and conſult with him. This they did, and were much, pleaſed when the king propoſed taking the field with an army, and not to act any longer by ſtealth with the enemy. But before they came to a final reſolution, Aelfrid, that his ſubjects might not hazard too much, expoſed his own perſon in an extraordinary manner:—He went in the habit of a harper into the enemy's camp, and was admitted every where about it without ſuſpicion; he even had the honour to play before their princes. Having furniſhed himſelf with an exact knowledge of their ſituation, he returned with great ſecreſy to his friends, whom he directed to go to their ſeveral homes, and each of them to draw together as great a force as he poſſibly could; with which, on a day prefixed, he was to come to the great wood, now called Selwood, in Wiltſhire. This they punctually performed; and the Danes were not a little ſurpriſed when they heard that king Aelfrid, whom they looked upon as a fugitive, was preparing to attack them with a royal army. The king took advantage of their confuſion, fell upon, and totally defeated them at Aethendune, now called Eddington. Thoſe who eſcaped took poſſeſſion of a ruined caſtle in the neighbourhood, which they fortified, but they were ſoon beſieged by the victorious Saxons. After a long and cloſe ſiege, the Danes were obliged to ſurrender at diſcretion. Aelfrid behaved to them like a merciful prince, by giving up the kingdom of the Eaſt Angles to ſuch as would embrace the Chriſtian religion, on condition that they would oblige the reſt of their countrymen to quit the iſland, and prevent, as far as was in their power, the landing of any more foreigners. For the performance of theſe articles he took hoſtages; and when, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0613800301:61"/>
of the treaty Guthrum, the Daniſh captain or king, came with thirty of his chief officers to Aelfrid, who then lay encamped at Aalre, now Auler, a ſmall village in Somerſetſhire, to be baptized, the king anſwered for him at the fort, gave him the name of Aethelſtan, and adopted him for his ſon. He then entertained him and his friends twelve days at his houſe at Wedmore, or Wetmore, and then diſmiſſed them with noble preſents. By the Danes turning Chriſtians, the Saxons gained this great advantage, that they now kept their oaths, and for the preſent remained very quiet. Some time after this, a freſh ſet of Danes came up the river Thames, and wintered at Fulham; but finding Aelfrid well prepared to receive them, thought proper to go off and try their fortunes in France. The Saxon fleet being very ſucceſsful at ſea, the king ſpared neither pains nor expence to keep it in good order. In 884 the Danes landed in Kent, and laid ſiege to Rocheſter; but it was ſo bravely defended by the inhabitants, that the king came in time to relieve them, forced the enemy to raiſe the ſiege, and return once more to France. Soon after, his fleet had the good fortune to beat a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable one of the Danes, deſtroyed thirteen ſhips, and according to the king's orders, gave no quarter to any of the men on board. In a ſhort time after this the Saxons themſelves were defeated; but this was an advantage to them, as it cauſed them to be more vigilant for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Aelfrid having ſome leiſure time now, reſolved to repair, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, and repeople the city of London, which he had lately recovered from the Danes, and meant to keep as a frontier. Accordingly he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified it, placed a garriſon in it, and eſtabliſhed Aethered as the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. He created him Earl of Mercia, and gave him his daughter Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleda in marriage. This earl was a gallant officer and great ſtateſman; for which reaſon the Saxons that had ſubmitted to the Danes, and the Danes that had began to learn the Saxon manners, were obedient to him, and ſettled in London, and the other places under his juriſdiction. After a peace of ſome years, Aelfrid was again called into the field; for the Danes, who had been ſeverely beaten in the Weſt of France, came with a fleet of two hundred and ſixty ſail on the Eaſt coaſt of Kent, and landing, fixed themſelves at Appletree. Shortly after another fleet came up the Thames, conſiſting of eighty veſſels; they landed the ſoldiers, and built a fort at Middleton. Aelfrid, on finding himſelf in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, drew together a conſiderable army; but before he marched againſt the enemy, he obliged the Danes that were ſettled in Northumberland and Eſſex, to give hoſtages for their good behaviour. He then moved towards the invaders, and very prudently choſe a camp between their armies, by which means he prevented their junction. A great body of them moved into Eſſex, and from thence, croſſing the river, came into
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0613800301:62"/>
Surrey. The king's forces met and defeated them at Farnham. In the midſt of theſe confuſions, the Danes who were ſettled in Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land broke their faith; and, notwithſtanding the hoſtages they had given, equipped two fleets, the one of a hundred, and the other of forty veſſels. After plundering the northern and ſouthern coaſts, they ſailed round, came to Exeter, and beſieged it. As ſoon as the king heard of their perfidious behaviour, he reſolved to march immediately to Exeter, leaving behind him a great body of Welſh. The Danes had got poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the place before he arrived; however he ſhut them up in it, and notwithſtanding they made many deſperate ſallies, kept them effectually blocked up. The body of Welſh he had left behind him, thinking it neither their intereſt nor duty to be idle, marched to London and joined the citizens. They had not been long in London, before news came that Haeſten, one of the Daniſh kings, with moſt of his forces, was marched out to forage, and had left his family and riches at Beamfleet, where he had built a fort. They reſolved to attack it in his abſence, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their enterpriſe; not only taking the place, with his wife and children, but alſo all the riches they had collected by many years rapine. Haeſten, when he received the news, was ſo much grieved, that he ſent to Aelfrid, who was then before Exeter, to beg a peace, which the good king granted upon very reaſonable terms; and which he, like a true Dane, broke as ſoon as it was concluded. He plundered the diſtrict belonging to Earl Aethered, though he had ſtood godfather to one of this prince's ſons; and, after all, joining the other Daniſh army, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them to Shobury in Eſſex, where they built another caſtle. Then paſſing the Thames with thoſe who joined them from Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the territories of the Eaſt Angles, they marched on to the Severn, laying waſte all in their way. On the banks of this river, viz. at the Buttington, in Montgomeryſhire, Aelfrid's generals gave them a check; and on the oppoſite ſide of the river hindered them from paſſing for many weeks. In the mean time the king had kept ſuch a cloſe ſiege at Exeter, and drove the people to ſuch extremities, that having eaten their horſes, they were ready to devour one another. Rendered deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by deſpair, they ſallied on the king's forces, but were beaten, though with great loſs on the king's ſide. The remains of this body of the Danes fled to their ſhips, and to their fort they had built in Eſſex. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the king had time to recruit, another Daniſh leader, whoſe name was Laf, came with a great army out of Northumberland, and deſtroyed all before them, marching on to the city of Werheal, or Cheſter. There they remained the reſt of that year; the next they invaded North Wales, which they plundered and deſtroyed; and when there was nothing more to be taken, they divided, one party returning into Northumberland,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0613800301:63"/>
and the other into the territories of the Eaſt Angles; whence proceeding into Eſſex, they ſeized upon a ſmall iſland, called Mereſig. They parted ſoon after this, ſome ſailing up the river Thames, and others up to Lee Road; where drawing up their ſhips, they built a fort twenty miles from London, which proved a great curb upon the citizens. The Londoners, unable to bear this reſtraint with any patience, went in a large body, and attacked the fort; but were repulſed with conſiderable loſs: which obliged the king, about harveſt-time, to encamp in the neighbourhood of that city, in order to cover the reapers from the incurſions of the Danes. Aelfrid one day riding by the river Lee, formed an opinion, that by cutting certain trenches the Daniſh ſhips might be laid quite dry. This he attempted, and ſucceeded in ſo well, that the Danes abandoned their fort, and marched away to the banks of the Severn; where having built a fortreſs at a place called Quatbrig, they wintered there. Such of the Daniſh ſhips as could be got off, the Londoners carried in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph into their own road, and deſtroyed the reſt. During three years, the Engliſh were not only vexed with the continual irruptions of theſe barbarous people, but ſuffered greatly by a dreadful plague, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected both people and cattle. The Danes, ever reſtleſs, began again to invade the territories of the Weſt Saxons both by land and ſea; having acquired the art of building long and large ſhips, they were in a manner maſters of that element, and of courſe depopulated all the coaſt. Aelfrid having long ruminated on the beſt method to prevent thoſe evils, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived larger and better ſhips than the Danes, and ſent them on the coaſts of the Iſle of Wight, and of Devonſhire, which were at that time infeſted by pirates. Aelfrid's ſquadron ſucceeded as well as could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, driving two of their ſhips on ſhore, ſinking three, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only one to eſcape. This was not executed without great loſs on the king's ſide, particularly among the officers. Such of the Danes as landed when their ſhips ran on ſhore, were taken priſoners, and brought to the king at Wincheſter; where he paſſed ſentence upon them, to be hanged, as pirates and murderers. In the ſubſequent part of the king's life, viz. in the years 898 and 899, nothing remarkable happened, except that the king employed the peace and leiſure he then enjoyed, in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing effectually that government which he had been at ſuch pains to frame, not more for the ſecurity of himſelf and ſucceſſors, than for the benefit of his ſubjects in general.</p>
            <p>Before the reign of Aelfrid, there were many kings who took the title, but none who could with propriety be called Monarch of the Engliſh nation. For though there always remained, after the time of Egbert, a prince who held a kind of pre-eminence over the reſt, yet he had not the direct dominion over his ſubjects; this Aelfrid had, in the latter part
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0613800301:64"/>
of his reign; to him all parts of England, not in poſſeſſion of the Danes, ſubmitted, and a great part of Wales: this great power was attained more by his wiſdom and mildneſs, than his ſword, or ambition of ruling. We have already mentioned the laws he made; and though there are few remaining, which we can aſcertain to be his, yet we are well informed, that to his regulations we owe many advantages, which render our conſtitution dear to us: for inſtance, trials by juries. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions were what is called the Common Law; ſo ſtyled, ſays a great author, either on account of its being the common law of all the Saxons, without reſpect to the kingdoms where they lived, or becauſe it was common both to the Saxons and Danes. It is, indeed, a diſputed point, whether he was the firſt who divided the kingdom into ſhires; but that he ſettled thoſe boundaries and leſſer diſtinctions that remain to this day, admits of no doubt. On this ſubject he formed a book, which contained a ſurvey of the kingdom, and of which the Doomeſday Book is in ſome reſpect a ſecond edition. He alſo made uſe of thoſe diviſions for the proper diſtribution of juſtice ſo happily, that though he found the kingdom in the utmoſt confuſion, and the people in it ſo indigent and given to rapine, that it was equally difficult to acquire wealth, or to keep it when acquired. Yet by his prudent government he ſo effectually cured the covetous ſpirit which induces one man to take from another, that authors tell us, money and jewels might be left on the public roads, with the greateſt ſafety. In the direction of ſtate affairs he followed the cuſtoms of his anceſtors, the kings of the Weſt Saxons. He made uſe of the great council of the kingdom, conſiſting of biſhops, earls, the king's aldermen, and his chief thanes, or barons, whom in the firſt part of his reign he convoked, as occaſion required; but when things were better ſettled, he made a law, that twice in the year an aſſembly, or parliament, ſhould be held at London, to provide for the well-governing of the commonwealth. As to extraordinary affairs, and ſuch emergencies as would not admit of calling great councils, the king then acted by the advice of his biſhops, earls, and officers of the army who happened to be near his perſon. With reſpect to military concerns, there has been ſo much ſaid already, that it renders it almoſt unneceſſary to add much here. Let it however be obſerved, that though this nation could never boaſt of a greater ſoldier, he was neither cruel, blood-thirſty, or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; he never made war willingly with any, or refuſed to grant peace when it was deſired: he fought fifty-ſix ſet battles by ſea and land, eight of which happened in one year. By degrees he rendered his troops invincible, by a juſt and regular diſcipline; and appointed ſuch methods of raiſing, recruiting, and diſtributing them in winter quarters, that his ſubjects and militia were ſynonymous terms; every man who could bear
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0613800301:65"/>
arms was a ſoldier, and no one ſerved out of his turn. His coaſts he ſecured by guardſhips; his frontiers were covered with caſtles, well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, which, before his time, the Saxons had never raiſed. Added to all this, his inſtructions and example raiſed numbers of abl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> officers, whoſe abilities the king conſtantly cheriſhed by proportionable rewards. In other affairs Aelfrid was equally great and induſtrious, as appears by his repairing the cities throughout his dominions which were demoliſhed by the Danes, erecting new ones, and adorning and embelliſhing ſuch as were in a mean and low condition. We may judge of the great things he per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormed in this way, ſince it is affirmed that one ſixth part of his clear revenu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s was applied to the payment of his workmen's wages. This prince was extremely remarkable for his piety with reſpect to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious foundations, and excelled moſt of his predeceſſors in this point: for beſides re-edifying and reſtoring almoſt every monaſtery in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, which the prevailing poverty of the times, or the ſacrilegious fury of the Danes, had brought to ruin, he built many, and improved more; beſides other acts of munificence towards the church. As to his founding the univerſity of Oxford, it is a matter that has been ſo warmly diſputed, that we ſhall only ſay what is certainly due to him on that head: he reſtored and ſettled it, endowed it with revenues, and placed there the moſt celebrated profeſſors of ſeveral ſciences. A king, who was ſo careful of his people, might well allow ſomething to his royal magnificence, eſpecially as he was ever mindful of his ſubjects' honour, and attentive to their eaſe. He repaired all the royal palaces, which the confuſion of the times before his reign had brought to decay; adorned the houſes of pleaſure in the country, and built many from the ground, where the ſituation was tempting. He had always a very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous court, and above all things took great pleaſure in ſeeing his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility about him. To do this without prejudice to the public, he fell upon a method which ought not to be forgotten; he framed three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent houſholds, each under a ſeparate lord chamberlain: theſe waited in their turns a month every quarter; ſo that in the year each of the king's menial ſervants was four months at court, and eight at home. In all other reſpects he was extremely careful to keep up both the dignity and luſtre of his court; but whether he made uſe of an imperial crown, enriched with jewels (as ſome affirm), is a point which may admit of diſpute. To conclude his character as a king, and there is not a brighter in the Engliſh, or perhaps any chronicles, we ſhall take notice of the manner in which he ſettled his revenue, and to which he ſtrictly adhered throughout his life: he firſt divided it equally, aſſigning one part to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, the other to civil uſes. The former he divided into four parts; one to be beſtowed in alms upon the poor in general; another he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0613800301:66"/>
deſtined for the ſupport of religious houſes which he had founded; a third was given to the public ſchools; and the fourth employed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building or relieving monaſteries, and other public foundations at home and abroad. The other moiety of his revenue was divided into three parts; one for the ſupport of his houſhold, another for the payment of his workmen, and a third for the entertainment and relief of ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>In his private life he was the moſt worthy, the moſt induſtrious, and the moſt amiable man in his dominions; of ſo equal a temper, that after he had once taken the crown, he never ſuffered either ſadneſs or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming gaiety to enter his mind; but appeared always of a calm, yet chearful diſpoſition; familiar with his friends, and juſt, even to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; kind and tender to all: he watched over his time with great care, and gave ſtrong evidences of much learning. With all theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, ſo many virtues, and ſo few vices, we need not wonder that he died univerſally lamented by his ſubjects. This happened, after a glorious reign of upwards of twenty-eight years, on the 20th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, A. D. 900. This king had to wife Aelſwith, or Aethelwith, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Earl Aethelred; by whom he had two ſons, and three daughters. Edward, the eldeſt, ſucceeded him on the throne; and is by moſt hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans called Edward the Elder, to diſtinguiſh him from the Confeſſor. His ſecond ſon was Aetheward, the youngeſt of all his children, and bred a ſcholar. His eldeſt daughter, Aethelfleda, was a woman of more than feminine ſpirit, and poſſeſſed ſuch a ſhare of her father's virtues, as enabled her to be very uſeful to her brother Edward, by giving him good advice. She married Aethered, Earl of Mercia, and, together with him, had the care of her nephew, Aethelſtan. Aelfrid's ſecond daughter was called Aethelgeow, or Aethelgora, and was abbeſs of her father's new foundation at Athelney. His youngeſt daughter, called Aelfreda, married Baldwin, Earl of Flanders. When we conſider the fame of this great king, we need not be ſurpriſed, that all our hiſtorians have been particular in tranſmitting the memory of his exploits to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, or that many conſiderable perſons ſhould compoſe ſpecial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of his life. Amongſt theſe, the firſt was Aſſerius Menevenſis, who wrote in the king's lifetime, and dedicated his book to Aelfrid himſelf. In later times, Sir John Spelman compoſed in Engliſh the life of this great prince, which he depoſited in manuſcript in the Bodleian library, where it remained a long time, before it was given to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. At laſt it appeared in a Latin tranſlation, by the ingenious Mr. Chriſtopher Wiſe. This only ſerved to raiſe a deſire of ſeeing Sir John Spelman's life as he left it; which, after much expectation, was gratified by Mr. Thomas Hearne. Beſides theſe, is a life, or rather a parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the life of Aelfrid and that of Charles I. written by a Mr.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0613800301:67"/>
Powell, with great ingenuity and learning. It would be doing this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion infinite ſervice, if a perſon equal to the taſk would, from theſe and other helps which might be met with, compoſe a new life of Aelfrid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting his laws and other things in their proper places, and illuſtrating them, as well as whatever paſſages might require it, with copious diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. This would place one of the moſt glorious periods of our hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in a proper light, and give us a very pleaſing view of our ancient conſtitution; which, the better it is underſtood, will appear to have been the beſt conducted for promoting the glory of the monarch and the good of the ſubject, that ever the world ſaw, or in all probability ever will, unleſs ſome future Aelfrid ariſe, and reform all the errors that time and accidents have brought into our ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>There was another Aelfrid, an illegitimate ſon of Oſwy, king of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland; and a third, whom we find diſtinguiſhed in Engliſh hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, viz.</p>

            <p>SON to King Aethelred, by Emma, of Normandy; was half-brother to King Edmund Ironſide, and brother of the whole blood to Edward the Confeſſor. His father's misfortunes being heavy, it was judged proper, anno 1013, to ſend him and his brother Edward into Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, to be bred up at the court of their uncle, Duke Richard. The Norman hiſtorians ſay, that Aethelred himſelf was obliged to fly into Normandy from the fury of the Danes, and left his two ſons there. After this king's death, his widow, Queen Emma, marrying the Daniſh king Canute, her ſons remained there. Duke Robert was kind to them; and when they were grown up, he made ſuch preparations for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading England, as alarmed the Daniſh monarch, and induced him to ſurrender a part of England to them. But their protector, Robert, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Holy Land, the Dane thought no more of the treaty. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Aelfred reſolved to venture ſomething, to recover his birthright; and embarking with a conſiderable body of Norman troops, arrived in England. He probably would have ſucceeded againſt Harold Hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, Canute's ſon, had he not been prevented by treachery.</p>
            <p>Godwin, Earl of Kent, pretended to join him; but perfidiouſly drew him into an ambuſcade, near Guilford; where, after a ſlight reſiſtance, he and his Normans were made priſoners. His troops were decimated, and himſelf carried priſoner to the Iſle of Ely. His eyes were put out, and he was committed to the care of the monks of that monaſtery; where he ſoon after died, ſome ſuſpect by a violent death. His abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſaid by our hiſtorians to be very great. He had more ſpirit than his brother Edward, which was the cauſe of his ruin: for Earl

            <head>AESCHYLUS,</head>
            <p>THE tragic poet, was born at Athens. Authors differ in regard to the time of his birth, ſome placing it in the 65th, others in the 70th Olympiad; but according to Stanley, who relies on the Arundelian mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, he was born in the 63d Olympiad. He was the ſon of Euphorion, and brother to Cynegirus and Aminias, who diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the battle of Marathon, and the ſea-fight of Salamis, at which engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Aeſchylus was likewiſe preſent. In this laſt action, according to Diodorus Siculus, Aminias, the younger of the three brothers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a ſquadron of ſhips, and behaved with ſo much conduct and bravery, that he ſunk the admiral of the Perſian fleet, and ſignalized himſelf above all the Athenians. To this brother our poet was, upon a particular occaſion, obliged for ſaving his life: Aelian relates, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0613800301:70"/>
Aeſchylus being charged by the Athenians with certain blaſphemous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in ſome of his pieces, was accuſed of impiety, and condemned to be ſtoned to death: they were juſt going to put the ſentence into execution, when Aminias, with a happy preſence of mind, throwing aſide his cloak, ſhewed his arm without a hand, which he had loſt at the battle of Salamis in defence of his country. This ſight made ſuch an impreſſion on the judges, that, touched with the remembrance of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and with the friendſhip he ſhowed for his brother, they pardoned Aeſchylus. Our poet, however, reſented the indignity of this proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reſolved to leave a place where his life had been in danger. He became more determined in this reſolution when he found his pieces leſs pleaſing to the Athenians than thoſe of Sophocles, though a much younger writer. Some affirm, that Aeſchylus never ſat down to compoſe but when he had drank liberally. He wrote a great number of trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, of which there are but ſeven remaining: and notwithſtanding the ſharp cenſures of ſome critics, he muſt be allowed to have been the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the tragic art. In the time of Theſpis, there was no public thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre to act upon; the ſtrollers driving about from place to place in a cart. Aeſchylus furniſhed his actors with maſks, and dreſſed them ſuitably to their characters. He likewiſe introduced the buſkin, to make them more like heroes.—The ancients gave Aeſchylus alſo the praiſe of having been the firſt who removed murders and ſhocking ſights from the eyes of the ſpectators. He is ſaid likewiſe to have leſſened the number of the chorus. M. Le Fevre has obſerved, that Aeſchylus never repreſented women in love in his tragedies; which, he ſays, was not ſuited to his genius; but, in repreſenting a woman tranſported with fury, he was incomparable. Longinus ſays, that Aeſchylus has a noble boldneſs of expreſſion; and that his imagination is lofty and heroic. It muſt be owned, however, that he affected pompous words, and that his ſenſe is too often obſcured by figures: this gave Salmaſius occaſion to ſay, that he was more difficult to be underſtood than the ſcripture itſelf. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe imperfections, this poet was held in great veneration by the Athenians, who made a public decree that his tragedies ſhould be played after his death. He was killed in the 69th year of his age, by an eagle letting fall a tortoiſe upon his head as he was walking in the fields. He had the honour of a pompous funeral from the Sicilians, who buried him near the river Gela; and the tragedians of the country performed plays and theatrical exerciſes at his tomb.—The beſt edition of his plays is that of London, 1663, fol. with a Latin tranſlation and a learned commentary by Thomas Stanly.</p>

            <head>AESCULAPIUS,</head>
            <p>IN the Heathen mythology, the god of phyſic, was the ſon of Apollo and the nymph Coronis. He was educated by the centaur Chiron, who taught him phyſic; by which means Aeſculapius cured the moſt deſperate diſeaſes. But Jupiter, enraged at his reſtoring to life Hippolitus, who had been torn in pieces by his own horſes, killed him with a thunderbolt. According to Cicero, there were three deities of this name: the firſt, the ſon of Apollo, worſhipped in Arcadia, who invented the probe, and bandages for wounds; the ſecond, the brother of Mercury, killed by lightning; and the third, the ſon of Ariſippus and Arſinoe, who firſt taught the art of tooth-drawing and purging. At Epidaurus, Aeſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius's ſtatue was of gold and ivory, with a long beard, his head ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with rays, holding in one hand a knotty ſtick, and the other entwined with a ſerpent; he was ſeated on a throne of the ſame materials as his ſtatue, and had a dog lying at his feet. The Romans crowned him with laurel, to repreſent his deſcent from Apollo; and the Phaliaſins repreſented him as beardleſs. The cock, the raven, and the goat, were ſacred to this deity. His chief temples were at Pergamus, Smyrna, Trica a city in Ionia, and the iſle of Coos; in all which, votive t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his ſervice. He travelled through Greece, and paſſed by Athens ſoon after Piſiſtratus had aſſumed the ſovereign power: finding the Athenians very impatient under their yoke, he told them the fable of the frogs, who petitioned Jupiter for a king. Aeſop was certainly happy in his inventions to inſtruct mankind: the images he makes uſe of are all that is neceſſary to perfect a precept, and are both uſeful and agreeable. He may be juſtly eſteemed wiſe, ſince he wrote in an entertaining and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive ſtyle, which charms and captivates the human mind. Aeſop ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death at Delphi.

For this they contrived an accuſation of ſacrilege againſt him; and pretending they had convicted him, threw him headlong from a rock. For this cruel action, we are told, they were viſited by a famine and peſtilence: and on conſulting the oracle, they received for anſwer, that the god deſigned this as a puniſhment for the treatment of Aeſop. They endeavoured to make an atonement, by erecting a pyramid to his honour.</p>

            <p>A LEARNED and induſtrious antiquary, was born 1540, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated for the practice of the law. In proceſs of time he became a clerk in the Exchequer office, and in 1570 deputy chamberlain of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, under Sir Nicholas Throgmorton; which place he held forty-five years. The great love he had for Engliſh antiquities led him to make large and laborious collections; and the office he held, afforded him an opportunity to acquire great ſkill in the moſt intricate part of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary's ſtudy. A conformity of ſtudies brought him acquainted with the elder Sir Robert Cotton, with whom he ever had a ſtrict friendſhip. Indeed, Anthony Wood tells us, he received all his knowledge in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities from him; which is not very probable; as he came into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer office the ſame year Sir Robert Cotton was born. Beſides Sir Robert Cotton, Mr. Agard had the moſt learned and eminent men in the kingdom for his friends and acquaintance. There exiſted, in his time, a moſt illuſtrious aſſembly of learned perſons, who ſtyled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Society of Antiquaries, Mr. Agard was one of the principal members, as appears from ſome diſcourſes read in that ſociety, and ſince printed and publiſhed by Mr. Hearne. Beſides five diſcourſes in this collection, and another of much older date, it is not known that our author had more in print. Theſe, however, ſhew, that in antiquities he had few equals, and no ſuperiors.</p>
            <p>In the buſineſs of his office he was particularly expert, as is evident from his diſcovering <hi>Richardus filius Nigelli</hi> to be the author of The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue of the Exchequer, which generally goes under the name of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus Tilburienſis. Mr. Madox, who publiſhed the Hiſtory of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, owned that this had been diſcovered by our author, Agard, who communicated it to the famous Selden. The Doomeſday Book our author had made his chief and particular ſtudy; and publiſhed a large and learned work on purpoſe to explain it; which was preſerved in the Cotton library. He likewiſe employed three years in compoſing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0613800301:75"/>
a book for the caſe of his ſucceſſors; containing a catalogue of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords as were in the four treaſuries, and an account of all leagues, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of peace, &amp;c. with foreign nations. This treatiſe he depoſited with the officers of the receipt, for the uſe of ſucceeding officers.</p>
            <p>By his will he directed, that eleven other manuſcript treatiſes, relative to Exchequer matters, ſhould be delivered up to the office. All the reſt of his valuable collections he bequeathed to his old friend, Sir Robert Cotton; in whoſe library as many as remain are ſtill to be found. For, notwithſtanding his making ſo much uſe of his pen, his modeſty would not permit him to publiſh any thing. After having thus ſpent his days in learned tranquillity, he thought of death before it came, and cauſed a monument to be erected in the cloiſter, Weſtminſter Abbey, near the chapel-door. He died Auguſt 20, 1615. Mr. Camden ſtyles him a moſt excellent antiquary. Mr. Selden ſays, he was moſt painful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in things of that nature.

            <p>THE ſon of Ariſtobolus, was grandſon of Herod the Great, and born in the year of the world 3997. After the death of his father, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod his grandfather completed his education, and ſent him to Rome, to pay his court to Tiberius. The emperor profeſſed a great regard for Agrippa. and placed him in a ſituation under his ſon Druſus, whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he ſoon gained. But the ſudden death of Druſus cauſed all thoſe who had been much eſteemed by him to be removed from Rome, by the command of Tiberius, who was fearful their preſence might add to his affliction. Agrippa, after having indulged his inclination almoſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, found himſelf under the neceſſity of quitting Rome, involved in debt, and very indigent. He abandoned the idea of returning to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, being conſcious he could not make a figure there ſuitable to his birth. For this reaſon he retired to the caſtle of Maſſada, where he lived for ſome time, by the aſſiſtance of his uncle Herod, more like a prince, than what he really was. He made him principal magiſtrate of Tiberias, and gave him a large ſum of money: but the expences of Agrippa were ſo enormous, that his uncle grew weary of aſſiſting him, and reproached him with his extravagance. Agrippa took offence at this, and reſolved to return to Rome. When he arrived there, he was received favourably by Tiberius, and commanded to attend the ſon of Druſus. But Agrippa preferring Caius, the ſon of Germanicus (and grandſon of the Empreſs Antonia), whoſe favour he had formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed, attached himſelf to him with great aſſiduity. The behaviour and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0613800301:77"/>
abilities of Agrippa made ſuch an impreſſion on this prince, that he kept him conſtantly about his perſon.</p>
            <p>Eutyches, a ſlave, whom Agrippa had made free, overheard him one day expreſs a wiſh for the death of Tiberius, and advancement of Caius, which he made known to the emperor. In conſequence of this, Agrippa was committed to the cuſtody of an officer, and loaded with fetters; but was ſoon releaſed from his confinement by the death of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius, who was ſucceeded by Caius Caligula. The new emperor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed many favours upon Agrippa, gave him a chain of gold in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his iron fetters, placed a crown upon his head, and granted him the tetrarchy, which Philip, the ſon of Herod the Great, had poſſeſſed, that is, Batanaea and Trachonitis; and added to this that of Lyſanias. Agrippa ſoon went to Judea, to take poſſeſſion of his new kingdom.</p>
            <p>Caius was ſoon after killed; and Agrippa being then at Rome, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Claudius to keep poſſeſſion of the imperial dignity, to which he had been advanced by the army. Agrippa in this affair ſhewed more cunning and addreſs, than ſincerity and honeſty; for while he pretended to be in the intereſt of the ſenate, he ſecretly prevailed upon Claudius to be reſolute, and not abandon his good fortune. For this advice the emperor gave him all Judea and the kingdom of Chalcis, which had been poſſeſſed by his brother Herod. Thus Agrippa became ſuddenly one of the greateſt princes of the Eaſt, and poſſeſſed of as many territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if not more, than Herod the Great had ever held. Agrippa now returned to Judea, and reigned with great ſatisfaction to the Jews. But through too great a deſire of pleaſing them, and a miſtaken zeal for their religion, he committed an action, the injuſtice of which is related in Scripture, Acts xii. 1, 2, &amp;c. For about the feaſt of paſſover, in the year of Jeſus Chriſt 44, St. James Major, the ſon of Zebedee, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to St. John the Evangeliſt, was ſeized by his order, and put to death. He alſo laid hands on St. Peter, and impriſoned him, with an intent to execute him when the feſtival was over. But God having mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly delivered St. Peter from his confinement, fruſtrated the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Agrippa. After the paſſover, this prince went to Ceſarea, and had games performed there in honour of Claudius. The inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon waited on him here, to ſue for peace. Agrippa came early in the morning to the theatre, with a deſign to give them audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and ſeated himſelf on his throne, dreſſed in a robe of ſilver tiſſue, embroidered in an elegant ſtyle. The rays of the riſing ſun darting on it, gave it ſuch a luſtre, that the eyes of the ſpectators were dazzled with looking on it. And when the king ſpoke to the Tyrians or Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, the paraſites around ſaid it was the voice of a god, and not that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0613800301:78"/>
of a man. Inſtead of rejecting theſe impious flatteries, Agrippa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with an air of complacency; but at the ſame time obſerved an owl above him on a cord. He had ſeen the ſame bird before, when he was in bonds by order of Tiberius; and it was then told him, that he ſhould be ſoon ſet at liberty: but that whenever he ſaw the ſame thing a ſecond time, he ſhould not live above five days afterwards. He was therefore extremely terrified; and died at the end of five days, rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with tormenting pains in his bowels, and devoured with worms.

            <p>SON of Goran, king of Scotland. His father was murdered by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, in the year 535, at which time this prince was very young. Eugenius, nephew to the laſt king, ſucceeded to the throne. He was a good officer and a wiſe prince, having gained much experience in the ſervice of the celebrated Arthur, king of the Britons, whom he long ſerved under, but at the ſame time very artful. He laid aſide all thoughts of revenging his uncle's murder, and even took into his favour Donald of Athol, who was chief promoter of it. The queen Dowager was ſo much alarmed at this, that notwithſtanding his pretended friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for her and her family, ſhe took the firſt opportunity of quitting the kingdom, and retiring, with her two ſons, Reginans and Aidan, into Ireland, the latter was then about ſeven years of age. They were very kindly received by Tauthalius the reigning king. The queen, and her eldeſt ſon, died there. Aidan continued there forty-eight years, great part of which time Eugenius reigned; and after him his brother Congallus. This laſt mentioned king being conſcious of the wrong done to the right heir of the crown, ordered Aidan to be brought home, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken and performed by the celebrated St. Columb. But on their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in Scotland, they were informed the king was dead, and that his brother, Kennatillus, was by the Scots put in poſſeſſion of the throne. After the burial of the deceaſed prince, Columb went to court with Aidan; and, to the ſurpriſe of all people, was received by the new king with much kindneſs and reſpect, he telling Aidan, he ſhould aſſiſt him in governing the kingdom, which would become his very ſhortly, to whom of right it pertained. The king being old and infirm, died ſoon after, and was ſucceeded by Aidan, according to Boëtius, in the year 578. He was crowned king of Scotland by Columb, who, in an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant oration, made for the occaſion, excited the prince to juſtice, and the people to obedience. Aidan went into Galloway, immediately after his coronation, and ſuppreſſed certain robbers who had infeſted that country, and committed great outrages in it. He inſtituted annual aſſizes there, at Lochaber, and Caithneſs. But ſome of the young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility quarrelling at a hunting match, ſuddenly interrupted theſe works of peace. This affray ending in bloodſhed, cauſed ſeveral of them to retire into the dominions of the Britiſh king. Aidan, in virtue of a treaty with this prince, often demanded them, and was conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. Incenſed at this treatment, he entered his country, took a great number priſoners, and carried off a quantity of cattle. Brudeus reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, made an attack upon Galloway, and did much miſchief. At length a general engagement enſued, the Picts were routed with great
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0613800301:80"/>
ſlaughter; the Scots loſt a number of men, and amongſt them Arthur, the king's ſon. St. Columb hearing of this war, came to the king, and charged him with ſhewing too much willingneſs to ſhed blood; this made ſo ſtrong an impreſſion on the mind of the prince, that he would not ſuffer this excellent man to depart till he undertook to negociate a peace, which he executed with great ſucceſs. The Saxons, having driven the Britons into Wales, were now in poſſeſſion of England. Ethelfrid, who then reigned in Northumberland, was an artful and ambitious prince. He wiſhed to make a conqueſt of the Pictiſh kingdom; but finding himſelf too weak to accompliſh it, prevailed on Brudeus to break the peace with the Scots, thinking by this means to weaken and obtain a victory over him. Aidan hearing of theſe negociations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a treaty, offenſive and defenſive, with Maelgwyn, the Britiſh king. As ſoon as the Saxons were informed of this, they determined to invade the Britiſh territories, in order to draw the Scots from their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This manoeuvre ſucceeded, for Aidan inſtantly marched to aſſiſt his allies; and, joining the Britiſh army, offered battle to Ethelfrid and Brudeus, which, for two reaſons, they choſe to decline; firſt, that they were weary of the Scots; next, to give Ceuline, king of the Weſt Saxons, an opportunity of joining them. Aidan, and his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates being appriſed of their intention, reſolved to attack Ceuline, before his junction ſhould render them too powerful. They performed this with great bravery, and by forcing their camp, cut to pieces and deſtroyed a great number of their armies, and among them Cutha, ſon to the king of the Weſt Saxons. Notwithſtanding this, the remainder joined their friends, and offered battle a ſecond time to Aidan, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved very gallantly in this engagement, but was ſo unfortunate as to loſe his ſon Griffin, and his nephew Brennius, Earl of Man. The Saxons and Picts had a great number of private men killed, and both their princes wounded. Ethelfrid loſt one of his eyes, and Brudeus received a deep wound on his hip. Ethelfrid joined the Picts early the next ſummer, and with a numerous army invaded Galloway. Aidan was better prepared to receive them than they had reaſon to ſuppoſe; and taking the advantage of their ſtraggling about the country, he cut off ſeveral of their parties; but finding that theſe loſſes obliged them to keep cloſe in camp, he reſolved to march ſilently by it on a dark night, to join the Britons, and encamped in a narrow valley in Annandale, where the Saxons and Picts with a great army ſurrounded them, and flattered themſelves that ſeizing all the paſſages, they ſhould eaſily rout their enemies. But Aidan conſulting his generals, they agreed to make great preparations, by fortifying their camp, and to appear as if they waited for an attack; when they had completed this, they lighted up a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0613800301:81"/>
number of fires, and decamped in the night. By paſſing certain rivers, deemed not fordable by the Saxons, they entered Northumberland, deſtroying the country with fire and ſword. This obliged the Saxons and Picts to follow them; a pitched battle enſued; the Saxons and Picts, after an obſtinate engagement, were totally routed with prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſlaughter. Ceuline, king of the Weſt Saxons, was killed on the ſpot. Aidan having gained this great victory, cauſed all the ſpoil which they had brought out of Galloway to be reſtored to the right owners; a tenth of the remaining booty he gave to be diſtributed in alms, the reſt was divided equally amongſt the Scottiſh and Britiſh ſoldiers. All the trophies of this conqueſt he ſent to St. Columb, in the iſland of Columb-Kill, to be depoſited in his abbey.</p>
            <p>He reigned quietly after this, for about eleven years, when Ethelfrid prevailed on the Picts to renew the war. Aidan, though very old, marched to the place where he expected the Britiſh army to have joined him; but his allies failing, gave his enemies ſuch an advantage over him, that they cut to pieces the chief of his forces; the king himſelf had a narrow eſcape. The fall of Theobald, the king's brother, proves this to have been a hard-fought battle, the conſequences of which, and the news of the death of St. Columb, haſtened the end of the good old king, and brought him to the grave in the year 606. He reigned thirty-two years, and was, when he died, ſeventy-eight years old.</p>

            <p>EARL of Cornwall and Devonſhire. He was great in authority and riches, and in his appearance of piety; it is not known of what family he was. He founded the abbey of Cerne, in Dorſetſhire, and had ſo great an eſteem for Eadwald, brother to St. Edmund the Martyr, that, with the aſſiſtance of Archbiſhop Dunſtan, he removed his relics to the old church of Cernel. He founded the abbey of Eyreſham, in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire, and the priory of Bruton in Somerſetſhire, in 1005, both for the Bendictine monks. In 1013, when Swene, king of Denmark, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted England, and obliged Aethelred to ſhut himſelf up in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, Ailmer ſubmitted himſelf to the conqueror, and gave him hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

He died ſoon after this, and we find only one ſon of his mentioned in hiſtory, whoſe name was Aethelward, Earl of Cornwall: he followed his father's principles, and was properly rewarded for it by Canute, who, after reaping the benefit of their treaſon, and finding the traitors no longer uſeful, ordered Eadric Streone and Earl Aethelward both to be put to death.</p>

But nothing could reclaim him, or incline him to return home; for as he lived, ſo he died, in exile. It was certainly a misfortune, that the obſtinacy of his own ſpirit, and the rigorous adminiſtration in the church, excluded ſo able a man from the public exerciſe of his miniſtry: he had a ſtrong under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, quick penetration, and wonderful diligence; but theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

Mr. Ainſworth was much eſteemed in his lifetime, in his own country, and ſeveral of his books were more than once reprinted after his death; yet, through a prevailing contempt for men of his ſentiment, and too cold a reception of that kind of learning, which rendered him famous, his works are more known and valued abroad than here: we ſeldom find an Engliſh author oftener quoted, or with greater teſtimonies of his merit, than Dr. Ainſworth. A higher character of the veneration he has acquired cannot well be expected, than that which occurs in all the late editions of Moreri's dictionary, when with great pains, and much gravity, they caution us to diſtinguiſh between Henry Ainſworth, the able commentator of the Scriptures, and Henry Ainſworth the Hereſiarch, who was one of the chief Browniſts in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; nevertheleſs, nothing is more certain than that theſe two were the ſame man.—There was another writer whoſe works bore ſome affinity to his, and are ſometimes aſcribed to him, whoſe chriſtian name was William; and beſides him, there was a Mr. Samuel Ainſworth, a nonconformiſt miniſter, in Northamptonſhire.</p>

            <head>AKENSIDE (MARK).</head>
            <p>AN eminent poet and phyſician, was born at Newcaſtle upon Tyne, on the 9th of November, 1721. He was the ſecond ſon of a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial butcher of that town.</p>
            <p>At the free-ſchool of Newcaſtle he received the firſt part of his gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical education, and was afterwards put under the care of Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a diſſenting miniſter, who kept a private academy at Newcaſtle. At eighteen he was ſent to the univerſity of Edinburgh, with a view to be brought up for a diſſenting miniſter, his parents and relations in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral being of the Preſbyterian perſuaſion. He proſecuted his ſtudies on this plan for one year only, during which time he received ſome aſſiſtance from the funds which the Engliſh diſſenters employ in edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating young men of no fortune. But his views as to the miniſtry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, he turned his thoughts to phyſic, and ſcrupulouſly repaid his benefactors the money they had advanced him; which having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to a different purpoſe, he thought it diſhonourable to retain. Whether in relinquiſhing his deſign to be a diſſenting miniſter, he ceaſed to be a diſſenter, is not certainly known.</p>
            <p>His genius and taſte for poetry diſplayed themſelves when he was at the ſchools at Newcaſtle; and it is ſaid that his "Pleaſures of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," and ſeveral other pieces, were firſt written by him at Morpeth, while he was upon a viſit to his relations, before he went to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Edinburgh. At Edinburgh he diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal compoſitions. His Ode on the Winter Solſtice was certainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at that place. After ſtaying three years at Edinburgh, he removed to Leyden, where he ſtudied two years; and there, in May 1744, took his degree of doctor in phyſic. In his inaugural diſſertation, he is ſaid to have diſplayed his medical ſagacity, by attacking ſome opinions of Leuwenhoek, and other writers, at that time very generally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but which have ſince been diſcarded by the beſt phyſicians and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; and by propoſing an hypotheſis which is now conſidered as founded in truth.</p>
            <p>The ſame year his poem "on the Pleaſures of Imagination" appeared; which was, in general, received with great applauſe, and raiſed his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation high in the poetical world. But Mr. Warburton, ſo much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for his learning, and afterwards Biſhop of Glouceſter, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with a note in the third book, concerning the nature and objects of ridicule, thought proper, in a preface to certain remarks on his antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, to make ſome ſevere ſtrictures on our author, in which he attacked him as a philoſopher only, and not as a poet. Dr. Akenſide in return was warmly vindicated by an anonymous friend, who was the late Jeremiah Dyſon, Eſq.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0613800301:87"/>In this pamphlet, which is intitled "An Epiſtle to the Reverend Mr. Warburton," there are ſeveral ſenſible obſervations, but the ſtyle is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant. The review of the controverſy, whether ridicule be the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of truth, will be more ſuitably introduced when we come to the life of Lord Shaftſbury, the noble author of the Characteriſtics. The poem "on the Pleaſures of Imagination" was quickly followed by "An Epiſtle to Curio," containing a warm invective under that name againſt the right honourable William Pulteney, Earl of Bath, whom he ſtigmatizes as the betrayer of his country. Dr. Akenſide was afterwards ſo diſſatisfied with this piece, that he altered it greatly, changing it into the form of an ode, and reducing it to half the number of lines it then contained. In 1741, he publiſhed ten odes on different ſubjects; written, as he tells us, with a view to vary different manners of expreſſion and verſification. The merit which he chiefly pretended to, was that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing correct, and of carefully attending to the beſt models. Theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent productions appeared before he was twenty-four years of age; but he was afterwards more ſlow in his publications. His Ode to the Earl of Harrington came out in 1748, and in 1758 he expreſſed his deſire of rouzing his countrymen by "An Ode to the Country Gentlemen of England." Few of his other poetical pieces were publiſhed ſeparately, except "An Ode to Thomas Edwards, Eſq." on the late edition of Mr. Pope's works, which had been written in 1751 (but was not printed till 1766); with a view to ſhew the author's diſlike to Dr. Warburton. The reſt of Dr. Akenſide's poems have been printed in Dodſley's collection.</p>
            <p>His principal work as a phyſician, was "A Treatiſe on the Dyſentery," written in Latin, and publiſhed in 1764.</p>
            <p>To return to the circumſtances of Dr. Akenſide's private life:—Soon after his quitting Leyden, he ſettled for ſome time in Northampton; while here, he carried on with Dr. Dodderidge an amicable debate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the opinions of the ancient philoſophers, with regard to a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments; in which Dr. Akenſide ſupported the opinion of Cicero in this important article of natural religion. But he, either not meeting with ſufficient encouragement, or being ambitious of moving in a larger field, removed to Hampſtead, where he reſided two years and an half, and then ſettled in London. He had but little practice when he firſt began, and in order to enable him to make a proper figure in the world, his generous and intimate friend, Mr. Dyſon, allowed him three hundred pounds a year.</p>
            <p>It is uncertain whether Mr. Dyſon had any bond or ſecurity from him on this account, but it appears that this gentleman, at his deceaſe poſſeſſed his effects, particularly his books and prints; the laſt he took great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in collecting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0613800301:88"/>Dr. Akenſide in a ſhort time gained great reputation, came into full practice, and arrived at moſt of the honours incident to his profeſſion. He was choſen fellow of the royal ſociety, became phyſician to St. Thomas's hoſpital; was admitted, by mandamus, to the degree of doctor in phyſic in the univerſity of Cambridge; and was elected a fellow of the royal college of phyſicians in London. Upon the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the queen's houſhold, he was appointed one of the phyſicians to her majeſty. He died on the 23d of June, 1770, of a putrid fever, in the 49th year of his age, and was buried in the pariſh of St. James's, Weſtminſter. Dr. Akenſide was particularly attached to ancient literature, and was a great admirer of Plato, Cicero, and the beſt philoſophers of antiquity. His taſte and judgment in this reſpect are conſpicuous in his poems, and in his notes and illuſtrations annexed to them. That he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a ſincere reverence for the great and fundamental principles of religion, is ſtrikingly apparent in ſeveral of his writings; eſpecially in his Ode to the Author of the Memoirs of the Houſe of Brandenburgh: in ſhort, Dr. Akenſide's high veneration for the Supreme Being, his noble ſentiments of the wiſdom of Divine Providence, and his love of virtue, ſhine through all his poems. In his Ode to William Hall, Eſq. with the works of Chalieu, he juſtly condemns the licentiouſneſs of that poet. His ſtrong attachment to the cauſe of civil and religious liberty, bears a diſtinguiſhed feature in the character of his poetical writings. He embraces every opportunity of diſplaying his zeal concerning this ſubject, two of his principal odes are devoted entirely to it, one of which is to the Earl of Huntingdon, the other to the Biſhop of Wincheſter. He and his friend Mr. Dyſon, in early life, were ſuch ſtrenuous advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for liberty in its moſt extenſive ſenſe, that they were ſuſpected to poſſeſs ſome tincture of republicaniſm; but Dr. Akenſide's poems are by no means a ſufficient proof of this, for when he celebrates the cauſe of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with a reference to our own country, he doth it in no other light than that of a zealous whig, who was warmly attached to the revolution, and to the great men who effected it. He is remarkable in teſtifying his veneration and regard for William III.; and if there be any truth in the ſuppoſition that he and his friend poſſeſſed republican ideas in their youth, it is more than probable that they ſoftened, if not quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed, the rigour of their ſentiments. The alteration of ſome lines in the Ode on leaving Holland, and in that to the Earl of Huntingdon, have been taken notice of in this light; Mr. Dyſon, in 1772, publiſhed a beautiful and complete edition of Dr. Akenſide's Poems, with his laſt corrections and amendments. The firſt poem in this collection, is "The Pleaſures of Imagination," as it had originally appeared. We have before obſerved, that it in general met with great applauſe, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0613800301:89"/>
raiſed the author's reputation high in the poetical world. Mr. Cooper, in his fourth edition of Letters concerning Taſte, has ſpoken of him in the following ſtrain of commendation "For my part I am of opinion, that there is now living a poet of as genuine a genius, as this kingdom ever produced, Shakeſpeare alone excepted. The gentleman I mean is Dr. Akenſide, the worthy author of "The Pleaſures of Imagination," the moſt beautiful didactic poem that ever adorned the Engliſh language." Mr. Cooper, in the firſt edition of his work, carried his praiſe of the doctor to a ridiculous height of extravagance. On the other hand, the late eminent poet, Mr. Gray, in a letter to Dr. Wharton, treats this poem with great ſeverity. "You deſire to know," ſays he, "what character the poem of your young friend (Dr. Akenſide) bears here? I wonder you aſk the opinion of a nation, where thoſe who pretend to judge, do not judge at all, and the reſt (the wiſer part) wait to catch the judgment of the world immediately above them, that is Dick's, and the Rainbow Coffee-houſes. Your readier way would be to aſk the ladies who keep the bars in thoſe two theatres of criticiſm. However, to ſhew you that I am a judge as well as my countrymen, I will tell you, though I have only turned it over (any more than them), that it appears to me above the middling; and now and then, for a little while, equal to the beſt, particularly in deſcription. It is often obſcure, and often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible; and too much infected with the Hutchinſon jargon; in ſhort, its great fault is, that it was publiſhed nine years too ſoon. And ſo methinks, in a few words, I have very pertly diſpatched, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might for ſeveral years have employed a very ingenious man, worth fifty of myſelf." Theſe obſervations being delivered before the poem had been maturely examined, we may be allowed to think them too ſevere, and ſteer a middling courſe between Mr. Gray and Mr. Cooper. The obſcurity of "The Pleaſures of Imagination," is moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in the allegory of the ſecond book. It might, likewiſe, have been better, if the peculiar language of Hutchinſon, or rather Shaftſbury, had ſometimes been omitted. Nevertheleſs, we cannot but regard it as a noble and beautiful poem, diſplaying great genius and fancy, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſublime views of nature, providence, and morality. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely agree with Mr. Gray in ſuppoſing it came out too early; the author himſelf, afterwards, entertained the ſame ſentiments. He was convinced that the poem was defective in ſome reſpects, and redundant in others. "His editor" ſays he "was perfectly ſenſible that it wanted reviſion and correction;" but the demand was ſo quick for ſeveral ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive re-publications, that it would have been impoſſible to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the whole of this correction; and to have gone on from time to time, making freſh improvements in every edition, would he thought
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0613800301:90"/>
have at leaſt the appearance of abuſing the favour of the public. On this account he continued to print it without alterations, for ſeveral years, with a view of giving at once his corrections and improvements complete to the public. He meant to review and correct this poem at his leiſure, but he found the taſk grow ſo much upon his hands, that he abandoned the purpoſe of correcting, and determined to write it over again, upon a more enlarged, and ſomewhat different plan. Dr. Akenſide did not live to finiſh his plan. He deſigned, at firſt, to compriſe the whole of his ſubject in four books, but he afterwards changed his purpoſe, and reſolved to diſtribute "The Pleaſures of Imagination" into a greater number. It is impoſſible to ſay how far his ſcheme would have carried him, if he had lived to execute it; for at his death he had only finiſhed his firſt and ſecond books, a conſiderable part of the third, and the introduction to the laſt. The firſt book of the new edition bears a ſtronger reſemblance to the firſt book of the former than any of the reſt do. There are, however, perceptible corrections, alterations, and additions. Dr. Akenſide has introduced a tribute of reſpect to his friend Mr. Dyſon. He has referred "The Pleaſures of Imagination" to two ſources only, greatneſs and beauty. His delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beautiful objects is greatly enlarged, and his firſt book ſeems to have received much improvement. The ſecond book differs eſſentially from the former editions, indeed ſo much, that they will not bear a compariſon. The author enters into a diſplay of truth, and its three claſſes; matter of fact, experimental or ſcientifical truth, and univerſal truth. He treats alſo of virtue, as exciting in the divine mind; of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man virtue, of vice and its origin, of ridicule, and of the paſſions; what he ſays upon the ſubject of ridicule, is greatly reduced from what it was in the preceding copies. The allegorical viſion, which conſtituted a principal part of the ſecond book, in his firſt poem, is likewiſe omitted. The character of the ſecond book as it now ſtands is, that it is correct, moral, and noble. The third book is an epiſode, in which Solon the Athenian lawgiver is the chief ſubject; this part is entirely new, and would have proved a beautiful addition to the poem, if Dr. Akenſide had lived to finiſh it, it is greatly to be regreted that he died before he completed his deſign. We ſhould, notwithſtanding, have been ſorry to have had the original poem entirely ſuperſeded, for whatever may be its faults, we find in it a certain brightneſs of imagination, and a degree of enthuſiaſm, which ſeem to have forſaken the doctor in the latter part of his life.</p>

adviſed, into Lancaſhire, where he was born; and there, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his own ſafety, exerted himſelf to the utmoſt in making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and diſſuading ſuch as were already Catholics from going to heretical conventicles. In order to carry his point the more effectually, he wrote, and diſtributed ſeveral little pieces, which were afterwards printed; but rendered himſelf ſo obnoxious to the government by theſe endeavours, that a ſtrict ſearch was made after him by the magiſtrates; which forced him to quit that country, and to ſeek an aſylum in the neighbourhood of the city of Oxford, where he concealed himſelf for ſome time. In this retreat, he wrote a kind of apology for his party, under the title of "Brief Reaſons concerning the Catholic Faith. Some indeed ſay, this was written at the houſe of the Duke of Norfolk, in Norfolk, where it is certain Alan was concealed ſome time, though he returned again into the neighbourhood of Oxford, where he diſtributed copies of the work, to fix the minds of thoſe who wavered between the two religions; and to draw over ſuch as already doubted their ſafety, while remaining in the eſtabliſhed church. Such ſucceſs attended his endeavours, that he refuſed to take the opportunity of a ſhip going to the Netherlands, and choſe to ſtay in that dangerous ſituation, promoting as far as lay in his power the doctrine of popery, and the juriſdiction of his Holineſs, and ſuch as derived their authority from him. With this view, he ventured to eſtabliſh a correſpondence with ſome of his old friends in the univerſity, and among the reſt, with a perſon who was formerly a Papiſt, but then of the eſtabliſhed church, and one of whoſe preferment his family had great hopes; our author, by his unwearied applications drew back this man to his former opinions, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated his relations ſo much, that they perſecuted Alan with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted diligence; this obliged him to fly towards London; and not long after, with ſome difficulty he made his eſcape into Flanders in 1568, having remained in England three years. It is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he had ſome great friends here, who, in reſpect to their former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, were well pleaſed at his withdrawing a ſecond time beyond ſea. Amongſt whom we may reckon Sir Chriſtopher Hatton, afterwards chancellor, who received part of his education in St. Mary's Hall, at Oxford, while our author was principal thereof. On this account, Sir Chriſtopher had a great regard for Alan; and Alan en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained ſo high an opinion of him, that he raiſed his reputation to the greateſt height abroad, which cauſed ſome invidious reflections at home. After Alan came a ſecond time into the Spaniſh low countries, he went to Mechlin, in the dutchy of Brabant, and read a divinity lecture in a monaſtery there, with great applauſe. He went from thence to Douay, where he became doctor in divinity, and took great pains to eſtabliſh a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0613800301:93"/>
ſeminary there, for the ſupport of Engliſh ſcholars; this being looked upon with an evil eye by the government in England, cauſed him to write a book in defence of ſuch inſtitutions. While he was thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, he was made canon of Cambray, a very conſiderable and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able preferment, conferred on him purely to reward his zeal for the catholic church. In this ſeminary of Douay, many books were wrote to juſtify the popiſh religion, and to anſwer the books wrote in defence of the church of England, which occaſioned queen Elizabeth to iſſue a proclamation, forbidding ſuch books to be either ſold or read. In 1567, our author, Alan, appointed one Briſtow, who became afterwards a very eminent man, moderator of ſtudies at Douay; this Briſtow, in all probability, was the man whom Alan drew over to his opinions when he was in England, as is before mentioned. Not long after, Dr. Alan was appointed canon of Rheims, through the intereſt of the Guiſes, and to this city he transferred the ſeminary which had been ſettled at Douay; his motive for making this alteration, was, becauſe Don Lewis de Reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens, the then governor of the Netherlands, had obliged the Engliſh fugitives to withdraw out of his government. From this time Dr. Alan was eſteemed the chief of his party; and indeed he laboured inceſſantly to do it ſervice, by writing various treatiſes in defence of the doctrines, and ſeveral by way of apology for the practices of the Papiſts; by licenſing and recommending many books written by others, and by journies into Spain and Italy. By his diligence he procured a ſeminary to be eſtabliſhed at Rome, and two others in Spain, where Engliſh ſtudents were not only educated, but were alſo maintained, and provided for. At home, Dr. Alan was juſtly reputed a capital enemy of the ſtate; all correſpondence with him was looked upon as the higheſt kind of treaſon, and Thomas Alfield, a Jeſuit, was actually executed for bringing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain books of his writing into England. The celebrated Robert Parſons, the Jeſuit, was Dr. Alan's great friend and counſellor, and very probably put him upon that deſperate project, which, if it had ſucceeded, would have overwhelmed the Engliſh; and which, as it miſcarried, did in a manner enervate the Spaniſh monarchy. For many years there had been differences, diſcontents, and even actual injuries committed between the Engliſh and the Spaniards; but now Dr. Alan, and the fugitive noblemen from England prevailed upon King Philip the ſecond openly to undertake the conqueſt of their native country. To facilitate this, Sixtus the fifth, who was then pope, was perſuaded to renew the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication thundered againſt Queen Elizabeth by his predeceſſor Pope Pius V. While this was in agitation, Sir William Stanley, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a conſiderable garriſon of Engliſh and Iriſh in the important town of Daventer, baſely betrayed it, and went with his whole regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0613800301:94"/>
of twelve hundred men into that ſervice. Rowland York, who had been likewiſe intruſted with a ſtrong fort in the ſame country, acted in the like infamous manner, to the great aſtoniſhment of the ſtates general of the United Provinces, and brought much ſcandal on the Engliſh nation. Dr. Alan wrote a treatiſe in defence of this baſe proceeding, and ſent ſeveral prieſts to Stanley, in order to inſtruct thoſe he had drawn over to the king of Spain's ſervice. To add to the weight of thoſe writings, the Dr. on the twenty-eighth of July, 1587, was created cardinal, by the title of St. Martin in Montibus, and ſoon after the king of Spain gave him an abbey of great value, in the kingdom of Naples, with ſtrong aſſurances of much greater preferment, which was afterwards performed. In April 1588, he compoſed that work which rendered him famous abroad, and infamous at home. It conſiſted of two parts, the firſt explaining the pope's bull, for the excommunication and deprivation of Queen Elizabeth; the ſecond exhorting the nobility, and people of England to deſert her, and take up arms in favour of the Spaniards. Of this book it is ſufficient to ſay, that it was by far the ſevereſt piece ever written againſt an Engliſh prince, and very capable of producing miſchievous effects; many papiſts are inclined to believe that the cardinal was compelled to take this book upon himſelf, and that in reality it was either written or altered by Father Parſons and other Jeſuits. Many thouſand copies were printed at Antwerp, in order to have been put on board the Spaniſh armada, that they might have been diſtributed by the Papiſts all over England, upon the firſt landing of the Spaniards. But this enterprize failing, theſe books were ſo carefully deſtroyed, that very few were preſerved. One of the printed copies was tranſmitted by ſome of the lord treaſurer's ſpies, to the Engliſh council, and Queen Elizabeth ſent Dr. Dale into the Low Countries, to make a complaint of ſuch a proceeding to the Prince of Parma, who pretended to have much friendſhip for her majeſty. He heard this account with a great deal of phlegm; and anſwered, that as he knew of no ſuch book, he could not ſay any thing to its contents. After the armada was deſtroyed, Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, who had been three years in priſon, under the charge of high treaſon, was brought to his trial, and the great charge upon him was, his correſponding with cardinal Alan, which being proved, he was found guilty by the peers. In the ſame year the king of Spain promoted the cardinal, as he had promiſed him, to the archbiſhopric of Mechlin, in Flanders, where he would have wiſhed him to have conſtantly reſided, in order to his more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually cheriſhing the Popiſh and Spaniſh intereſts in England. But the pope entertained ſo high an opinion of the cardinal's merit, and found him of ſuch great ſervice in conſiſtories, that he would not ſuffer him to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0613800301:95"/>
leave Rome, where he continued to labour as earneſtly as ever in the ſervice of his countrymen, and the catholic faith. It has been aſſerted by ſome, that he and Sir Francis Englefield aſſiſted Father Parſons in compoſing his traiterous book concerning the ſucceſſion, which he publiſhed under the name of Doleman, and which was of ſuch danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequence, that it was made capital by law for any perſon to have it in his cuſtody. Others affirm that he had no hand in it, and was greatly diſpleaſed with this treatiſe, as it tended to perpetuate thoſe diſſentions, which had for ſo many years torn and diſtracted his nativ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The remainder of his life he ſpent at Rome in great honour and reputation, living in much ſplendor, and uſing all his intereſt for the comfort and maintenance of ſuch poor catholics as fled out of England. The adminiſtration here had many ſpies upon him, and it appeared by the papers of the treaſurer Burleigh, that he had conſtantly very diſtinct accounts of every ſtep the cardinal took. In the laſt years of his life, he is ſaid to have changed his ſentiments, as to government, and to hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him, that he was well gone, for if he had lived but a little longer, he would have diſgraced himſelf, ſhamed his country, and loſt the credit he had gained; yet they ſhortly after, for many reaſons, altered their tone; and when they found how little credit theſe diſcourſes met with, they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the cardinal's memory, as if he lived a ſaint, and died a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. But in order to give the reader a proper idea of this behaviour we muſt obſerve, that before the Spaniſh invaſion, in 1582, it was thought neceſſary to have ſome Engliſhman promoted to the rank of cardinal. The candidates were Dr. Lewis, Biſhop of Caſſana, and Dr. Alan; and much intereſt was made on both ſides. But the Jeſuits being apprehenſive of Biſhop Lewis's coming to the honour, it was procured for him of whom we are writing; when they found he would not go theſe lengths, they treated him as ill as ever they had done any of their greateſt enemies. They were ſtill fearful that Biſhop Lewis might put on that hat which Alan had left, and began to obſerve in all companies, that the cardinal was a perfect ſaint, that he was juſtly admired by ſeveral popes, reſpected by all the princes of Europe, who either knew, or heard of him; that his whole ſtudy was for the good of his country, and the maintenance of the catholic religion; that notwithſtanding all this, the Biſhop of Caſſana had made it the buſineſs of his life to perſecute and diſturb this holy man. We ſhall, no doubt, find it a difficult taſk to give this eminent perſon his true character: however, ſince it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, we ſhall attempt to do it with as much truth as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and from the beſt authority. If we conſider him as an Engliſh ſubject, writing, adviſing, and acting againſt his prince, we muſt look upon him as a buſy, enterprizing, and dangerous rebel, labouring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the deſtruction of his prince, and her people, equally ready to perſuade foreigners to invade, or ſubjects to riſe up in arms: and if on the other hand, we look on him as a zealous papiſt, and as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in his conſcience, that what he did was agreeable to the doctrines of the church, we cannot then deny him the title of a learned, active, and induſtrious perſon; and far from being an enemy, in the latter part of his life particularly, either to his country or to his lawful ſovereign Queen Elizabeth. Laſtly, taking him merely as an author, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably, for matter, method, wit, learning, and language, one of the moſt conſiderable writers of the age. It is ſtrange, that many of our writers of controverſy, and ſome not unlearned, have treated our author as a Jeſuit; whereas, in all controverſies between that order and the ſecular prieſts, the latter always gloried in Cardinal Alan, as a man to whom no Jeſuit could be juſtly compared in any reſpect. Before we cloſe this life, it will be neceſſary to remark, that at Rome, and every where abroad, Cardinal Alan was ſtyled Cardinal of England, regarded
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0613800301:97"/>
as the protector of the nation, and honoured with extraordinary reſpect. He had about him ſeveral perſons of ſome diſtinction, particularly Mr. Fitzherbert, who wrote a large account of his life, which was never printed. To maintain his magnificence, he had 15,000 crowns per annum, then computed 4,500 pounds of our money.</p>

R.S.S. baron of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, puiſne judge of both benches to king George the Firſt, and a peer of Ireland in the ſubſequent reign; was born 7th March, A. D. 1670. Being ſecond ſon to Edmund Forteſcue, of London, Eſq. by Sarah his wife.</p>
            <p>Our judge was deſcended from Sir John Forteſcue, lord chief juſtice, and lord high chancellor of England, under King Henry the Sixth. [See Greg. Pref. ap. Forteſc. de Laud. Leg. Angl. V. Hickes' Pref. ap. Theſaur. XLVI.] Sir John Forteſcue Aland added his latter name of Aland in compliment to his lady, who was the eldeſt daughter to Henry Aland, Eſq. of Waterford, in our ſiſter kingdom; and ſure it was a very great compliment indeed (whether the ſame was paid to mental accompliſhments, perſonal charms, or large fortune) to ſuffer any name to ſuperſede that of Forteſcue, in the honour of his deſcent from which anceſtor he ſeems to have gloried very much.</p>
            <p>Whether our judge was educated at a public ſchool, or privately at home, we have not been able to learn, but that he was at college, ſeems not to admit a doubt; becauſe Oxford complimented him with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary degrees of doctor of laws, as a member of that univerſity, if the following extract from the diploma (which may be ſeen prefixed to his volume of Reports) authorizes us in the aſſertion, viz. "mirâ ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in has muſarum ſedes benevolentiâ propendentem, nec minorem inde reportantem."</p>
            <p>Sir John Forteſcue Aland, as an Oxonian, greatly improved his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural endowments, and deſervedly had the reputation of being a general ſcholar [See Greg. Pr. ap. Forteſcue de Laud. Leg. Angl. V.] and as he was intended for the profeſſion of the Law, upon leaving the univerſity, he, Sir John, became a member of the Inner Temple, where he was choſen reader in the year 1716, 2 Geo. I. as appears by a ſubſcription to his arms, ("azure, a bend engrailed argent, cottiſes or;" creſt "a plain ſhield argent."

            <p>He was called to the bar about the happy aera of the glorious Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; this we aſſert from conjecture, made on the following calculation: Sir John Forteſcue Aland was born in the year 1670, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution happened in 1690, ſo that our barriſter was at that period twenty years old, the uſual age at which young gentlemen are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally called to the bar.

            <p>The learned ſerjeant, William Wynne, ſeems to have miſtaken the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Sir John Forteſcue Aland, in the exchequer, for that in the king's-bench, if we may preſume to make the obſervation from the date (viz. 1718), which by the concurrent teſtimony of reſpectable authorities, was the year our baron was promoted to the king's-bench, and not to the exchequer; for the reſolutions and opinions of our judge, while he ſat in this court, ſee Lord Raymond's Reports, his <hi>own</hi> Reports, thoſe of Lucas, [or X.

            <p>On Monday the 9th of June, 1727, Trinity term, 13 Geo. I. Mr. Juſtice Aland, in a very ſerious ſpeech, pronounced ſentence for the execution of Major Oneby, convicted on a ſpecial verdict, found at the Old Bailey, in February ſeſſions, 12 Geo. I. for the murder of Mr. W. Gower; all the judges of England being unanimouſly of opinion that the priſoner was guilty of murder; becauſe when the deceaſed ſaid to him, "Though we have had hot words, and you was the aggreſſor, yet I think we may paſs it over," and at the ſame time offered his hand to the major: to which he anſwered "No, damn you, I will have your blood." This ought to be a caution to people, not to make uſe of ſuch ſort of expreſſions, as many are apt to do, in heat, anger, vexation, and paſſion.</p>
            <p>Upon the morning of Monday, July 3d, being the day appointed for the execution of Major Oneby, he opened a vein and bled to death, to avoid the infamy of a public execution.</p>
            <p>Upon the trial of an information, filed <hi>ex officio</hi> by the attorney general, in the court of king's-bench, againſt Edmund Curl, of notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous memory for infamous publications, Mr. Juſtice Aland differed from the other three judges, viz. Sir Robert Raymond, chief juſtice, James Reynolds, Eſq. and Sir Edmund Probyn, on that proſecution.</p>
            <p>Our judge owned the charge againſt Curl, (which was for printing and publiſhing "Venus in the Cloyſter, or the Nun in her Smock," Stra. Rep. XI. 788.) to be a very great offence, but knew of no law by which the court could puniſh it, that common law is common uſage, and where there is no law, there can be no tranſgreſſion; he obſerved, that at common law, drunkenneſs, or curſing and ſwearing were not puniſhable, and yet he did not find the ſpiritual court take notice of them; that Curl's offence was but a general ſolicitation of charity, and

            <p>Perhaps if our judge had riſen to the fur previous to Pope's publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his imitations of Horace, the poet would not have paid that compliment to Aland's judicial capacity, which he did to his legal, as we have obſerved of Pope in the former part of this article, eſpecially when the reader is informed, that the poet was of the Roman Catholic perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>After the acceſſion of his late majeſty King George the Second, all the judges had new patents, [See Wynn. Serj. at Law, 102.] except Mr. Juſtice Forteſcue Aland, whoſe commiſſion was ſuperſeded. [Lord Raym. Rep. II. 1510.]</p>
            <p>One Jewell was taken on an eſcape warrant, made by our judge, and the court of king's-bench was moved to diſcharge the defendant, and the warrant, becauſe he was taken on 6 Jan. 1727-8, and Sir John Forteſcue Aland was removed from his office of judge of the ſaid court of king's-bench in October 1727, his patent being determined on the demiſe of the late King George the Firſt, and accordingly the priſoner was diſcharged, and the warrant alſo.

            <p>Sir Francis Page was removed out of the court of common pleas, into that of the king's-bench, in the place of our judge.</p>
            <p>Sir John Forteſcue Aland was the only judge removed, and the reaſon generally aſſigned was, his opinion on the following grand queſtion, viz.</p>

            <p>The two diſſenting judges were, Sir Robert Eyre, ſecond Juſtice of the King's-Bench, afterwards Lord Chief Baron, and Lord Chief Juſtice of the Bench, and</p>
            <p>Robert Price, ſenior Baron, afterwards a Judge of the Bench.</p>
            <p>The opinions of all the judges, with their reaſons, are inſerted at large, in our article of the laſt-mentioned judge, viz. Sir Robert Price.</p>
            <p>Ten judges were of opinion (which, with the reaſons at large, may be ſeen in our judge's Reports) that their education and the approbation of their marriages did belong to his majeſty; but we very much doubt the authenticity of the ſaid general aſſertion of the cauſe for removing Sir John Forteſcue Aland, becauſe his Majeſty King George the Second hath immortalized his fame as the firſt magiſtrate of the world in three memorable inſtances, viz. of Major Oneby, above mentioned, Admiral Byng, and Earl Ferrers, names that will ever ſecure his majeſty in full poſſeſſion of that tranſcendant character; for though the king admired the valour of his army, honoured the bravery of his navy, and revered the exalted rank of the nobility, yet his majeſty at the ſame time abhorred the cruelty of a ſoldier, in the perſon of Major Oneby; deteſted a daſtard ſeaman, in that of Admiral Byng; and execrated the baſeneſs of a peer, in the perſon of Earl Ferrers; and, therefore, the firſt was to have been executed, had he not committed ſuicide; the next was ſhot for cowardice; and the third, though a baron of the realm, hanged for murder at Tyburn. But yet, though his majeſty was pleaſed to execute the law with Roman ſtrictneſs, he did it alſo with Roman juſtice, for he gave the two
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0613800301:105"/>
honourable delinquents an opportunity, not only to vindicate their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, but alſo to avail themſelves of every circumſtance in point of law, and that too after judgment, condemnation, and ſentence; for he reſpited the execution of the admiral, in order that he might have the opinion, not only of the twelve judges, but alſo of the high court of parliament, which he had. The judges were unanimous in confirming the ſentence of the court-martial, and the parliament declined impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or otherwiſe to interfere in their public capacity on his behalf.</p>
            <p>Earl Ferrers being tried before the Houſe of Lords, where all the twelve judges attended during the whole trial, the juſtice, the integrity, the abilities, and the candor of the judicature, rendered it the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and faireſt trial that man could poſſibly have here on earth.</p>
            <p>Nothing appearing on theſe very extraordinary proceedings in favour of either the illuſtrious priſoners, they were both executed in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner above related; as to all private interceſſion, his majeſty told the friends of the admiral, that he could ſhew him no mercy, as a king; and to the latter, none as a man; and aſked, "Whether if the earl's ſteward had murdered his lordſhip, the ſervant would have found even a ſingle friend at court?"</p>
            <p>Could a prince thus eminent for his regard to public juſtice, remove a judge, merely for giving his opinion in his judicial capacity, for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his office faithfully, impartially, honeſtly, and according to the beſt of his ſkill and knowledge, without fear or affection, prejudice or malice, becauſe his opinion happened to counteract the wiſhes of the heir apparent to the crown? incredible! eſpecially ſince his predeceſſor, Sir William Gaſcoigne, chief juſtice of England, hath been univerſally admired for his courage in committing ſuch heir, in the time of King Henry the Fourth; beſides, his royal highneſs well knew, that the point was a public matter, a national concern, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it would have been highly indecent in our judge to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his own private perſonal ſatisfaction to have interfered; in that ſuch conduct would militate againſt ſome of the moſt approved as well as ancient maxims of the law; ſuch as, for inſtance, "Salus populi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prema lex eſto;" "Privatum commodum publico cedat, ne reſpub. periat, aut quid detrimenti capiat;" "Lex citius tolerare vult privatum dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, quam publicum incommodum," and the like: and this is not all, for the Prince of Wales could not but conſider, that in time he might himſelf become king, and a grandfather in the lifetime of the father; ſo that taking our judge's opinion in this point of view, it was really aſſerting and ſupporting the prince's future authority, in a buſineſs of the very like nature.</p>
            <p>If the prince, when ſovereign, did ſuperſede our judge actually for the reaſon aſſigned by the lord chief juſtice Raymond, he muſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0613800301:106"/>
too, have incurred the odium of an unjuſt, tyrannical deſpot; for it ought to be recollected, that Sir John Forteſcue Aland was the youngeſt of the twelve judges at the time the opinion in queſtion was given, which was in the year 1717, and that the prince did not accede to the throne till the year 1727, ten years after the ſuppoſed diſpleaſure, for no abuſe of language, no miſconſtruction of actions, can torture our judge's opinion into an offence.</p>
            <p>George the Second was pleaſed not only to continue Sir Peter King (who was one of the ten judges that gave his opinion on the ſaid queſtion, which was called the grandeſt prerogative of the royal family), in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of King George the Firſt, in his office of chief juſtice of the bench, but alſo made him lord high chancellor.</p>
            <p>So that George the Second muſt have conceived an inſuperable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal antipathy to Sir John Forteſcue Aland, and that too for ten years together, <hi>tantaene animis coeleſtibus irae!</hi> and have acted therein in direct oppoſition to the great example of his royal Sire, on the very ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of affront; it cannot be; for a king of the diſpoſition of George the Second would, on the contrary, revere a judge of ſuch Roman forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and bleſſed with all the cardinal virtues of his office, courage, integrity, and abilities; and who gave ſo convincing a proof of his being poſſeſſed of every qualification requiſite for forming the complete character of a judge. But be our arguments well founded or not, and whether his late majeſty did act from the unjuſt motive above ſuggeſted, he ſoon ſatisfied mankind and the judge that all reſentment had ſubſided, and that he was reſolved to pay to our judge the tribute due to his merit; for, upon the death of Spencer Cowper, (which happened the very next year after Sir John Forteſcue Aland's removal) his majeſty was pleaſed to conſtitute him one of the juſtices of his court of common pleas, viz. 27 January 1728, Hilary Term, 2 Geo. II.; and what is rather a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular circumſtance, he ſucceeded Spencer Cowper, who ſucceeded our judge, on being ſuperſeded in manner and for the cauſe abovementioned.</p>
            <p>Viner hath inſcribed the nineteenth volume of his Abridgement to Mr. juſtice Forteſcue Aland, and his name appears to the imprimatur, in the profeſſional rank of a judge of the court of common pleas.</p>
            <p>We by no means approve of holding up characters in deriſion, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of natural or accidental corporeal defects, and therefore hope the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the bench and bar, in the ſtory we are about to relate for the momentary ſmile of the reader, may be offered in apology: Sir John Forteſcue Aland was remarkable for a very ſmall, ſhort, flat noſe: a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, who had the misfortune of having loſt one of his arms, arguing a cauſe rather aukwardly before our judge, the former obſerved to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>ALBAN (SAINT),</head>
            <p>FAMOUS for having been the firſt Chriſtian who ſuffered mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom in Great-Britain, for which reaſon he is uſually ſtyled the Protomartyr, was born at Verulam, of Pagan parents, and flouriſhed towards the end of the third century. In his youth he made a journey to Rome, and ſerved ſeven years as a ſoldier, in the armies of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror

Diocletian. He then returned home, and ſettled in the town of Verulam, where he was highly eſteemed by his countrymen, till the perſecution under the emperor, through the example and inſtructions of Amphibalus, he renounced the errors of Paganiſm, in which he had been educated, and became a thorough convert to the Chriſtian religion. He was put to death in the year of Chriſt 303, during the tenth, and laſt general perſecution of the church. The ſtory of his martyrdom, as related by Bede, is as follows:</p>
            <p>The Roman governor being informed that he entertained in his houſe Amphibalus, who was a Chriſtian, and not knowing that Alban had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one, ſent a party of ſoldiers to apprehend his gueſt. But Alban putting on the habit of his viſitor, preſented himſelf to the officers in his ſtead, and was carried before the magiſtrate. The firmneſs with which he behaved, and the declaration he made of his converſion to Chriſtianity, ſo enraged the judge, that he ordered him to be beheaded immediately. He had to paſs over a bridge in his way to execution, which was ſo thronged with ſpectators, that his paſſage was impeded. The ſaint, impatient for the crown of martyrdom, approached the brink, (ſays the hiſtorian) and lifting up his eyes to heaven, the ſtream was miraculouſly divided, and afforded a paſſage for himſelf and a thouſand people. This miracle converted the executioner, who threw away his drawn ſword, and falling at St. Alban's feet, deſired he might have the honour to die with him, or rather for him. This ſudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the executioner, occaſioning a delay in the execution, St. Alban walked up to a neighbouring hill, where praying for water to quench his thirſt, a fountain ſprung up under his feet. Here he received the crown of martyrdom, on the tenth of the kalends of July. The executioner was a ſignal example of divine vengeance; for, at the inſtant that the ſtroke was given to the ſaint, his eyes dropped out of his head. The behaviour of St. Alban at his death, and the miraculous circumſtances attending it, were inſtrumental in converting many of the ſpectators to Chriſtianity. Between four and five hundred years afterwards, Offa, king of the Mercians, built a very large and ſtately monaſtery to the memory of St. Alban, in the place where he ſuffered martyrdom.</p>

            <head>ALBUQUERQUE (ALPHONSO),</head>
            <p>A NATIVE of Portugal.—Little is known of this great commander before he was appointed by his king, Emanuel, to the command of a ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron deſtined for India, where by his exploits he raiſed the arms of his country to the higheſt pitch of glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0613800301:110"/>Emanuel, A.D. 1503, diſpatched ſix ſhips to India, under the command of Albuquerque, and the ſame year three more under his couſin, Francis Albuquerque. The latter arrived in India ſome time before the other, with two ſhips only, the other having periſhed by the way. Arriving at the iſlands of Anchedive, he found ſome Portugueze officers, from whom he learned the diſtreſſed ſituation of their ally Trimumpar, King of Cochin, and ſailed to Vipian, where the king then was. The arrival of the Portugueze ſo alarmed the garriſon that then had poſſeſſion of Cochin, that they precipitately left it. Here one of the ſhips that had ſailed from Portugal with Alphonſo, joined him. Francis reſtored Trimumpar to his capital, and ſubdued ſome iſlands near it.</p>
            <p>Having rendered the king ſuch eſſential ſervice, he deſired leave to build a fort as a mutual defence againſt their enemies; this was granted, and the fort immediately begun. Four days after it began, Alphonſo joined him, and with the additional number of hands he brought with him it was ſoon completed.</p>
            <p>A conſultation was then held among the Portugueze officers, when it was reſolved to attack ſome towns belonging to the Prince of Repelſin, about twenty miles diſtant from Cochin. The Portugueze ſet out in boats, and ſurpriſed the towns, but were ſoon after attacked by a large army, and obliged to retreat. They returned to Cochin, and the ſame night made an attack on ſome other villages. When Alphonſo being advanced with a freſh party, was attacked by ſome of the enemy who lay in ambuſh, and in this dangerous ſituation ſignalized himſelf by his courage, having fought with great intrepidity till break of day, when his brother Francis came to his aſſiſtance. The Portugueze then put the enemy to flight, purſued, and ſlew a great number of them.</p>
            <p>The fame of the Portugueze being ſpread every where, Alphonſo Albuquerque ſailed to Coulon to load three ſhips, which he completed without oppoſition, made an alliance with the people, and returned to Cochin. On his return, he found the Zamorin ready to enter into a a treaty of peace with him, which was concluded.</p>
            <p>The two brothers ſoon after ſailed to Cananor, and thence proceeded for Portugal. Alphonſo arrived ſafe at Liſbon; but it is moſt probable Francis periſhed at ſea, as he was never more heard of.</p>
            <p>In 1508, Alphonſo was appointed to ſucceed to the government of India, and diſpatched with five ſhips; he ſailed in company with Cugna, another Portugueze officer. Having plundered and taken ſome towns on the coaſt of Arabia, they ſailed to Zocatora, and made themſelves maſters of the fort there. After which Cugna returned to Portugal, and Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque began to act alone.</p>
            <p>He immediately formed the deſign of attacking Ormuz iſland, ſituated at the mouth of the Perſian Gulph, and ſubject to a king of its own,

who had extended his dominions over ſeveral cities in Arabia. With ſmall army of 470 men, he proceeded along the Arabian coaſt, too many towns, and proceeded to the iſland itſelf. He found ſeveral ſhip fitted for war in the harbour; theſe it was determined to burn.

ſhips, and evacuate the city, which he effected after a fierce combat, having firſt ſet fire to the magazines.</p>
            <p>He then ſteered to a place called Rapander to winter; but the enemy ſoon obliged him to remove, and take ſhelter between the continent and the iſland of Divar, where he was informed his enemies were alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to make an attack upon him. In this extremity, being alſo very ſcare of proviſions, he determined to make a deſperate effort on a ſtrong caſtle, called Pangin. Accordingly, having ſtationed a force to prevent ſuccours being ſent to it, he proceeded under cover of the night, and ſucceeded in ſurpriſing both the fort and camp of the enemy, both which were taken without much reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Such an unexpected turn of good fortune determined him not only to object to offers of peace, but alſo to make an attack on Goa. In this he ſucceeded, having in the attack killed 3000 of the enemy.</p>
            <p>Such ſucceſs induced him to aim at greater enterprizes. Having col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his forces, he ſailed from Goa for the iſland of Sumatra, and in every voyage made many captures; there having concluded a treaty with the princes of this iſland, he proceeded to the city of Malacca, and made himſelf maſter of it. Having ſettled affairs there, he returned to Goa, laid ſeige to the city of Benaſtar, and having been unſucceſsful, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to a peace with the Zamorin. He then built a fort at Calicut, and ſailed to Aden, in hopes of making himſelf maſter of it, but was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and obliged to return. Soon after he fell ſick and died, having firſt had the mortification to hear of his being recalled by the king.</p>
            <p>To this great man the Portugueze owe the foundation of the immenſe power they once poſſeſſed in India; and, had they purſued the maxims he laid down, might poſſibly have enjoyed to this day. He was a man of great humanity, dreaded for his bravery, and beloved for his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition. His death was moſt ſincerely felt by all the people of Goa, where he was buried with great funeral honours.</p>

            <p>IN elevation of birth, yielded to none of the Greeks; he was the ſon of Clinias, nephew of Pericles, and lineally deſcended from Ajax; in his perſon, while a youth, he was beautiful, and when a man, remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his comelineſs: his fortune was large beyond moſt of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Athens. His abilities were ſo great, that an ancient author (C. Nepos) has aſſerted that nature in him had exerted her utmoſt force, ſince, whether we conſider his virtues or his vices, he was diſtinguiſhed from all his fellow citizens; he was learned, eloquent, indefatigable, liberal, magnificent, affable, and knew exactly how to comply with the times; that is, he could aſſume all thoſe virtues when he thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0613800301:113"/>
for, when he gave a looſe to his paſſions, he was indolent, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, diſſolute, addicted to women, intemperate, and even inclined to profaneneſs. Socrates had a great friendſhip for him, corrected in ſome degree his manners, and brought him to the knowledge of many things of which he would otherwiſe have remained ignorant; he alſo prevented the Athenians from reſenting many of thoſe wanton acts of pride and vanity which he committed when a lad. His family had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been on good terms with the Lacedemonians; Clinias, his father, indeed, diſclaimed their friendſhip, but Aleibiades renewed it, and affected to ſhew great reſpect to people of that country, until he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ambaſſadors of Lacedemon applied themſelves wholly to Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias, his rival, and his dependants; he then reſented it very much, and uſed every influence to work on the minds of the Athenians to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of that people.</p>
            <p>The firſt public affair of any material conſequence in which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, was ſoon after the peace for fifty years was concluded between the Athenians and Lacedemonians; ſome diſcontents ſtill prevailed. The people of Athens had complied with the terms of the peace, but the Lacedemonians having got poſſeſſion of and demoliſhed the town of Panactus, made them uneaſy; theſe diſcontents were heightened by Alcibiades, who began now to rival Nicias, who, with his party, at that time ruled in Athens. Alcibiades declaimed, that the Spartans were now taking meaſures for humbling Argos, that they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attack the Athenians; he artfully put them in mind of Nicias having declined making a deſcent on Spacteria, and drew concluſions from thence very much againſt him. When the ambaſſadors from Sparta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When therefore, they firſt appeared in the forum, Alcibiades addreſſed himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Two years after, ſome diſſenſions taking place at Argos, Alcibiades ſailed with a fleet of twenty ſhips into their territories, to aſſiſt his friends, and put an end to their diſputes. To effect this, he cauſed three hundred of the inhabitants, who were ſuſpected of favouring the Lacedemonians, to be ſeized and carried away. After this, he ſailed to the iſland of Melos, which, although ſmall and of inconſiderable force, had always acted with inflexible obſtinacy againſt the Athenians. Alcibiades laid ſiege to it; but finding the ſiege attended with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, he turned it into a blockade, and leaving a conſiderable body of forces there, returned to Athens: the place afterwards ſurrendered at diſcretion.</p>
            <p>The Athenians, in the ſixteenth year of the war, determined to ſend a fleet into Sicily, to the aſſiſtance of the Egiſtines; Nicias was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to command, Alcibiades and Lamachus as his colleagues. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preparations for this expedition, an accident happened which put the whole city of Athens into confuſion: the Hermae, or ſtatues of Mercury, of which there were a multitude in the city and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, were all defaced in one night, nor could the authors of this fact be diſcovered, notwithſtanding a proclamation was iſſued, offering im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity and a reward for the informer; yet, in conſequence of a clauſe therein, inviting any perſon of what condition ſoever to diſcover any former ſacrileges, ſome ſervants and ſlaves depoſed, that a long time before, certain young men, heated by wine, had ridiculed ſome religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous myſtery, and that Alcibiades was among them: his enemies caught at this, and commenced a proſecution againſt him, to which Alcibiades offered to anſwer, aſſerting his innocence, and proteſting againſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations brought againſt him while he ſhould be abſent. His enemies, determined to attempt his deſtruction, procured others to move that he ſhould have liberty to depart on his command, and that, after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, a day of trial ſhould be aſſigned him; to this propoſition he was unwillingly obliged to conſent.</p>
            <p>The fleet ſailed; but they had not been long in Sicily, before orders from Athens arrived, directing Alcibiades to return and take his trial; the whole city being in a confuſion on the old affair of defacing the Hermae. This was a ſtate trick played by the enemies of Alcibiades, to ruin his mighty intereſt, which his birth, fortune, and accompliſhments had gained him in Athens: to effect their purpoſe, they alſo reported that he had entered into a conſpiracy to betray the city to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>acede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, and that he had perſuaded the Argives to undertake ſomething to their prejudice. It was therefore determined to put him to death on
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0613800301:115"/>
his return; but it being apprehended, that the attempt to arreſt him in fight of the army might produce great commotions, thoſe who were ſent to bring him home, were ordered to treat him with great decency, and not to diſcover by any means the ſevere reſolution taken againſt him. They executed their commiſſion very exactly, ſo that neither he nor his army, who were likewiſe accuſed, had any ſuſpicion: but, in the courſe of the voyage, gathering from the ſeamen ſomething of what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and being informed that a perſon, out of fear of death, had acknowledged himſelf guilty, and impeached them, they wiſely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to truſt an enraged and ſuperſtitious multitude, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their own ſafety by withdrawing as ſoon as they had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: this offered quickly after; they gave their convoy the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ip, and retired to ſuch parts of Greece as, out of hatred to Athens, were moſt likely to give them ſhelter.</p>
            <p>Alcibiades went to Sparta, where he was well received. In the ſpring, when Agis King of Sparta invaded Attica, he gave him advice to ſeize and fortify Dicelea. This was a ſevere ſtroke on the Athenians; but their misfortunes fell much heavier on them in Sicily, and their allies began to waver. They afterwards had ſome ſlight ſucceſſes at ſea, which diſcouraged the Peloponneſians; but Alcibiades exerted his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to perſuade them to continue the war; he adviſed them to ſend a ſmall fleet to Ionia, promiſing to engage the cities to revolt from the Athenians, and to negociate a league between Sparta and the King of Perſia, the advantages of which he pointed out to them. The Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians entering into his meaſures, he paſſed over into Ionia, and there actually effected what he had promiſed. He alſo found means to draw Tiſſaphernes, the King of Perſia's lieutenant, into a league with them. The Spartans, however, were diſpleaſed with the terms of it, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have them altered, the Perſians likewiſe grew diſpleaſed. Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades did not long continue in favour with the Spartans; and having debauched the wife of Agis, that prince conceived the moſt inveterate hatred againſt him, and perſuaded the Lacedemonians to ſend orders to their general in Ionia to put the Athenian to death. Alcibiades gained ſome intelligence of this, retired to Tiſſaphernes, and laying aſide the Lacedemonian, as he had before done the Athenian, became a perfect Perſian. By the politeneſs of his addreſs, he gained ſo much on Tiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes, although a profeſſed enemy to all Greeks, that he gave his name to his gardens of pleaſure, after he had ſpent immenſe ſums in adorning them; they were afterwards called Alcibiades. When the Athenian ſaw that Tiſſaphernes placed a confidence in him, he gave him great information reſpecting the affairs of Greece; told him that it was not the intereſt of the Perſian monarch that Athens ſhould be deſtroyed, but
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0613800301:116"/>
that ſhe and Sparta ſhould be ſupported as rivals to each other, and that then the Greeks would never have an opportunity to turn their united arms againſt his maſter; but added, that if it ſhould become neceſſary to rely on one of them, he adviſed him to truſt to Athens, becauſe ſhe would be content with the dominion of the ſea; but that the pride of the Spartans would always ſtimulate them to new conqueſts, and excite in them a deſire of ſetting the Greek cities in Aſia at liberty.</p>
            <p>Tiſſaphernes approving of theſe councils, Alcibiades wrote privately to ſome officers of the Athenian army at Samos, intimating that he was treating with the Perſian on their behalf; but would not return to his native country until the democratical form of government was aboliſhed. The reaſons he advanced for this meaſure were, that the Perſian king hated a democracy, but would immediately aſſiſt Athens, if the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was put into the hands of a few. Theſe fickle people, the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, prone to novelty, diſſolved the democracy, and ſent deputies to treat with Alcibiades and Tiſſaphemes; and, in caſe the terms offered by the Perſian were reaſonable, they were to declare that the Athenians would veſt the ſovereignty in the hands of a few. Before the deputies arrived, Alcibiades had diſcovered that Tiſſaphernes did not incline to keep the Athenians on any terms; therefore, he ſet up ſuch high terms in the name of the Perſians, that the Athenians themſelves broke off the treaty. The democracy of Athens was, however, deſtroyed, and a new form of government was ſet up. This did not give general ſatisfaction; the army at Samos declared for the democracy, and, at the requeſt of their general Thraſybulus, recalled Alcibiades.</p>
            <p>On his return, he made a moſt eloquent ſpeech to the army, ſhewing them the true ſource of his misfortunes, the injuſtice of his countrymen, and the danger attending the ſtate. The ſoldiers, pleaſed with his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, created him general, with full power, and propoſed ſailing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Athens to reſtore the ancient form of government: Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades oppoſed this extravagant meaſure, and told them, that ſince they had choſen him general, he muſt return to Tiſſaphernes to prepare things to make a ſpeedy end of the war: accordingly, with the conſent of the army, he departed. When he came to Tiſſaphernes, he extolled the great power of the Athenians; and, by this means, made himſelf formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to the one party, and neceſſary to the other.</p>
            <p>On his return to the army, the deputies from Athens were, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, received. The army declared to them they would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the preſent government, but would fail to Athens and reſtore the democracy: this he oppoſed, and perſuaded them to remain where they were; and told the deputies, to return and demand of the tyrants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign their authority. On their return, every thing was in confuſion at
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0613800301:117"/>
Athens; a new form of government was propoſed, and Alcibiades re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, and the favourers of an oligarchy withdrew to the enemy. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades mean time ſailed with thirteen galleys to Arpendus, where he had frequent conferences with the Perſian lieutenant. In his return, he took nine galleys belonging to the Peloponneſian fleet: with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his own ſquadron, he conſtrained the Halicarnaſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ans to pay a large ſum of money, and fortified Cos. An engagement ſoon after took place between the Athenian and Peloponneſian fleets, and, while the event was doubtful, Alcibiades came in ſight with twenty galleys, and ſecured the victory.</p>
            <p>The Athenians, after this, dividing their fleet into three parts, Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades, with his ſquadron, fell in with the enemy's fleet under Minda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, and fled from them, till he came in fight of the other diviſions, and then purſued them in his turn towards Claros, ſinking and taking their ſhips. When the enemy approached the ſhore, they were joined by the Perſians; a ſecond battle enſued, and a ſecond victory was obtained. Thus, to his immortal honour, Alcibiades gained two victories in one day.</p>
            <p>His fame now roſe high among his countrymen; they ſent 1000 foot, 300 horſe, and 30 galleys, to reinforce him. He ſailed and did good ſervice in the Helleſpont; afterwards ſat down before Byzantium, then well fortified and defended by a Lacedemonian garriſon. Some of the inhabitants betrayed the city, and let in Alcibiades and his army; the garriſon made ſo brave a defence, that he was on the point of being driven out; but, making a proclamation that the Byzantines ſhould be ſafe in their perſons and effects, they joined him; the garriſon was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all put to the ſword.</p>
            <p>Alcibiades, and his colleague Theramenes, returned in triumph to Athens; they brought with them ſuch immenſe ſpoils as had not been ſeen at Athens ſince the Perſian war. The people almoſt deſerted the city to behold Alcibiades when he landed. After he had made his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue in the aſſembly, they directed the record of his baniſhment to be thrown into the ſea, ordered him to be abſolved from the curſes he lay under, created him general, and conferred many other favours upon him. The ſweetneſs of his temper, his complacence, and his applying the riches he brought home to the diſcharge of taxes, made the moſt virtuous of the citizens confeſs he deſerved the honours that were paid him. He did not long remain in a ſtate of inactivity, but put to ſea again with a fleet of one hundred ſhips for the Helleſpont, to aſſiſt ſome cities which ſtill kept firm to the Athenians: he left part of his fleet under Antiochus, with ſtrict orders not to engage; but the latter diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded his inſtructions, and was defeated. On this news, Alcibiades re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0613800301:118"/>
but met with another ſtroke of ill fortune; for his enemies had found means to perſuade the Athenians that the defeat was owing to his inattention, and that he held a correſpondence with the Lacedemonians; they inſtantly deprived him of his command, and appointed ten new ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. To Conon, one of the ten, he delivered the fleet; but refuſed to return to Athens, and in his own ſhip paſſed into Thrace, built a caſtle there for his own ſecurity, and founded a little principality in the ſight of his many and powerful enemies.</p>
            <p>Alcibiades, though an exile, endeavoured to reſtore the power of his country; of which the Spartans having intelligence, procured him to be aſſaſſinated. He was a man of admirable accompliſhments, but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently principled; of great parts; and of an amazing verſatility of genius.</p>

            <p>BISHOP of Rocheſter, Worceſter, and Ely ſucceſſively in the latter end of the fifteenth century, was born at Beverly in Yorkſhire, and educated at the univerſity of Cambridge, where he took the degree of doctor of laws. In the year 1460, he was collated to the church of St. Margaret's, New Fiſh-ſtreet; and, in the ſame year, was advanced to the deanery of St. Stephen's college, Weſtminſter. He was appointed maſter of the rolls in 1462. Six years after, he obtained two prebends, one in the church of Sarum, the other in that of St. Paul's, London. In 1470, he was made a privy counſellor, and one of the ambaſſadors to the King of Caſtile; and, the next year, was among the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who treated with the commiſſioners of the King of Scotland. About the ſame time he was appointed, by Edward the Fourth, to be of the privy council to his ſon Edward Prince of Wales. In 1471, he was promoted to the biſhoprick of Rocheſter; and, in 1472, conſtituted lord high chancellor of England, which great poſt he did not hold longer than ten months. In 1476, he was tranſlated to the ſee of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and appointed lord preſident of Wales. While he was biſhop of Worceſter, he greatly enlarged the collegiate church of Weſtbury. The Protector, Richard Duke of York, removed him from his office of preceptor to Edward the Fifth, on account of his having incurred his diſpleaſure, by his ſtrong attachment to the prince. Soon after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Henry the Seventh to the throne, he again held the great ſeal for a ſhort time. In 1486, he was raiſed to the biſhoprick of Ely, in the room of Dr. John Morton, tranſlated to Canterbury. In 1488, he preached a ſermon in St. Mary's church, at Cambridge, which laſted from one o'clock in the afternoon till paſt three.

            <p>KING of Northumberland, was lineally deſcended from the King of Bernicia, and was born about the year 740. When he attained to man's eſtate, he found his country miſerably diſtracted, partly by the vices of the kings, and partly through the madneſs of the people. Oſulph, who was the lawful heir to the kingdom of Northumberland, periſhed by a conſpiracy of his own family in 758. To him ſucceeded Aethelwold, otherwiſe called Moll, by a popular election. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed many of the great lords, who under the command of Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win took arms againſt him; but with little ſucceſs, their army being routed, and Oſwin ſlain. Alcred then aſſerted his right to the throne, in which he proved ſucceſsful. Aethelwold had reigned ſix years.</p>
            <p>Alcred, ſoon after his acceſſion, married Oſgerna: he took pains to live on good terms with his neighbours, but was far from pleaſing his ſubjects; for, in 774, they compelled him to fly from York with a ſmall number of attendants. He retired to the ſtrong city of Bebba, thought to be the town now called Bamborrough in Northumberland: and thinking himſelf not ſafe here, he ſought protection of Cynoth king of the Picts, who treated him kindly. The hiſtorians affirm, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred was depoſed by the unanimous conſent of all the princes of the royal family, and other great lords of the kingdom. This circumſtance led the earl of Stamford, who was lord lieutenant of the county of Leiceſter in 1691, to introduce into a ſpeech he made at Leiceſter, to prove the legality of the Revolution, the right the people of this country had to expel a king for mal-adminiſtration.

            <head>ALCUINUS (FLACCUS),</head>
            <p>AN eccleſiaſtic of the eighth century. Born, according to the moſt probable opinion, in Yorkſhire. It is pretty certain he was educated at York, under the direction of archbiſhop Egbert, as we learn from his own letters, in which he frequently calls that great prelate his beloved maſter, and the clergy of York the companions of his youthful ſtudies. As he ſurvived venerable Bede about 70 years, it is hardly poſſible that he could have received any part of his education under him, as ſome writers of literary hiſtory have affirmed; and it is worthy of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he never calls that great man his maſter, though he ſpeaks of him with the higheſt veneration. It is not well known to what prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had attained in the church before he left England, though ſome ſay he was abbot of Canterbury. The occaſion of his leaving his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, was by his being ſent on an embaſſy by Offa king of Mercia to the emperor Charlemagne; who contracted ſo great an eſteem and friendſhip for him, that he earneſtly ſolicited, and at length prevailed upon him, to ſettle in his court, and become his preceptor in the ſciences. Alcuinus accordingly inſtructed that great prince in rhetoric, logic, mathematics, and divinity; which rendered him one of his greateſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites. "He was treated with ſo much kindneſs and familiarity (ſays a cotemporary writer) by the emperor, that the other courtiers called him, by way of eminence, <hi>the emperor's delight.</hi>" Charlemagne em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his learned favourite to write ſeveral books againſt the heretical opinions of Felix biſhop of Urgil in Catalonia, and to defend the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox faith againſt that hereſiarch, in the council of Francfort, A. D. 894; which he performed to the entire ſatisfaction of the emperor and council, and even to the conviction of Felix and his followers, who abandoned their errors. The emperor conſulted chiefly with Alcuinus on all things relating to religion and learning; and, by his advice, did many great things for the advancement of both. An academy was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the imperial palace, over which Alcuinus preſided, and in which the princes and prime nobility were educated; and other acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were eſtabliſhed in the chief towns of Italy and France, at his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and under his inſpection. "France (ſays one of our beſt writers of literary hiſtory) is indebted to Alcuinus for all the polite learning it boaſted of in that and the following ages. The univerſities of Paris, Tours, Fulden, Soiſſons, and many others, owe to him their origin and increaſe; thoſe of whom he was not the ſuperior and founder, being at leaſt enlightened by his doctrine and example, and enriched by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits he procured for them from Charlemagne." After Alcuinus had ſpent many years in the moſt intimate familiarity with the greateſt prince of his age, he at length, with great difficulty, obtained leave to retire from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0613800301:121"/>
court to his abbey of St. Martin at Tours. Here he kept up a conſtant correſpondence by letters with Charlemagne; from which it appears, that both the emperor and his learned friend were animated with the moſt ardent love to learning and religion, and conſtantly employed in contriving and executing the nobleſt deſigns for their advancement. He compoſed many treatiſes on a great variety of ſubjects, in a ſtyle much ſuperior in purity and elegance to that of the generality of writers in the age in which he flouriſhed. Charlemagne often ſolicited him, with all the warmth of an affectionate friend, to return to court, and favour him with his company and advice; but he ſtill excuſed himſelf; and nothing could draw him from his retirement in the abbey of St. Martin at Tours, where he died A. D. 804. His works were collected and publiſhed by Andrew du Cheſne in one volume folio, Paris, 1617. They conſiſt of, 1. Tracts upon ſcripture. 2. Tracts upon doctrine, diſcipline, and morality. 3.

He was corrector of the preſs a conſiderable time for Aldus Manutius, and is intitled to a ſhare in the praiſes given to the editions of that learned printer.

Paulus Manutius, in his commentary upon theſe words of Cicero <hi>Librum tibi celeriter mittam de Gloria,</hi> " I will ſpeedily ſend you my treatiſe on Glory;" has the following paſſage relating to the affair: "He means, ſays he, his two books on Glory, which were handed down to the age of our fathers for Bernard Juſtinian, in the index of his books, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Cicero de Gloria.</hi> This treatiſe, however, when Bernard had left his whole library to a nunnery, could not be found, though ſought after with great care: nobody doubted but Peter Alcyonius, who, being phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to the nunnery, was intruſted with the library, had baſely ſtole it.

            <head>ALDHELM (SAINT),</head>
            <p>BISHOP of Shereburn in the time of the Saxon heptarchy. He is ſaid to have been the ſon of Kenred, brother to Ina, king of the Weſt Saxons; but, in the opinion of William of Malmſbury, his father was no more than a diſtant relation to the king. Having received the firſt part of his education in the ſchool which one Macduff, a learned Scot, had ſet up in the place where Malmſbury now ſtands, he travelled into France and Italy for his improvement. At his return home, he ſtudied for ſome time under Adrian, abbot of St. Auguſtine's in Canterbury, the moſt learned profeſſor of the ſciences who had ever been in England. In theſe different ſeminaries he acquired an uncommon ſtock of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and became famous for his learning, not only in England, but in foreign countries: whence ſeveral learned men ſent him their writings for his peruſal and correction; particularly Prince Arcivil, a ſon of the king of Scotland, who wrote many pieces, which he ſent to Aldhelm, "intreating him to give them the laſt poliſh, by rubbing off their Scots ruſt." He was the firſt Engliſhman who wrote in the Latin language both in proſe and verſe, and compoſed a book for the inſtruction of his countrymen in the proſody of that language. Beſides this, he wrote ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other treatiſes on various ſubjects; ſome of which are loſt, and others publiſhed by Martin Delrio and Caniſius. Venerable Bede, who flouriſhed in the end of this and the beginning of the next century, gives the following character of Aldhelm: "He was a man of univerſal eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, having an elegant ſtyle, and being wonderfully well acquainted with books, both on philoſophical and religious ſubjects." In fact, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the cloud of ignorance by which he was ſurrounded, and the great difficulty of obtaining knowledge without proper inſtruction, Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helm was a very extraordinary man. From one of his letters to Hedda biſhop of Wincheſter, concerning the nature of his ſtudies whilſt at Canterbury, he appears to have been indefatigably determined to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire every ſpecies of learning in his power. For a copy of this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous epiſtle, ſee Henry's Hiſtory, vol. ii. p. 320. King Alfred the Great declared, that Aldhelm was the beſt of all the Saxon poets; and that a favourite ſong, which was univerſally ſung in his time, near 200 years after its author's death, was of his compoſition. When he was abbot of Malmſbury, having a fine voice, and great ſkill in muſic as well as poetry, and obſerving the backwardneſs of his barbarous countrymen to liſten to grave inſtructions, he compoſed a number of little poems, which he ſung to them after maſs in the ſweeteſt manner; by which they were gradually inſtructed and civilized. After this excellent perſon had governed the monaſtery of Malmſbury, of which he was the founder,

            <head>ALDRED,</head>
            <p>ABBOT of Taviſtock, was promoted to the biſhopric of Worceſter in the year 1046. He was ſo much in favour with King Edward the Confeſſor, and had ſo much power over his mind, that he obliged him to be reconciled with the worſt of his enemies, particularly with Swane ſon of the Earl Goodwin, who had revolted againſt him, and came with an army to invade the kingdom. Aldred alſo reſtored the union and friendſhip between King Edward and Griffin King of Wales. He took afterwards a journey to Rome; and being returned into England, in the year 1054, he was ſent ambaſſador to the Emperor Henry II.: he ſtaid a whole year in Germany, and was very honourably entertained by Herman archbiſhop of Cologn, from whom he learned many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, which on his return he eſtabliſhed in his own dioceſs. In the year 1058, he went to Jeruſalem, which no archbiſhop or biſhop of England had ever done before him. Two years after, he returned to England; and Kinſius archbiſhop of York dying the 22d of December, 1060, Aldred was elected in his ſtead on Chriſtmas day following, and thought fit to keep his biſhopric of Worceſter with the archbiſhopric of Canterbury, as ſome of his predeceſſors had done. Aldred went ſoon after to Rome, in order to receive the pallium from the pope: he was attended by Toſton Earl of Northumberland, Giſo biſhop of Wells, and Walter biſhop of Hereford. The pope received Toſton very honourably, and made him ſit by him in the ſynod which he held againſt the ſimoniſts. He granted to Giſo and Walter their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, becauſe they were tolerably well learned, and not accuſed of ſimony. But Aldred being by his anſwers found ignorant, and guilty of ſimony, the pope deprived him very ſeverely of all honours and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; ſo that he was obliged to return without the pallium. On his way home, he and his fellow-travellers were attacked by ſome robbers, who took from them all that they had, though they did not offer to kill them. This obliged them to return to Rome; and the pope, either out
<pb facs="tcp:0613800301:124"/>
of compaſſion, or by the threatenings of the Earl of Northumberland, gave Aldred the pallium; but he was obliged to reſign his biſhopric of Worceſter. However, as the archbiſhop of York had been almoſt entirely ruined by the many invaſions of foreigners, King Edward gave the new archbiſhop leave to keep twelve villages or manors which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the biſhoprick of Worceſter. Edward the Confeſſor dying in 1066, Aldred crowned Harold his ſucceſſor. He alſo crowned William the Conqueror, after he had made him take the following oath, viz. That he would protect the holy church of God and its leaders: that he would eſtabliſh and obſerve righteous laws: that he would entirely prohibit and ſuppreſs all rapines and unjuſt judgments. He was ſo much in favour with the Conqueror, that this prince looked upon him as a father; and, though imperious in regard to every body elſe, he yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to obey this archbiſhop; John Bromton gives us an inſtance of the king's ſubmiſſion, which at the ſame time ſhows the prelate's haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs. It happened one day, as the archbiſhop was at York, that the deputy-governor or lord-lieutenant going out of the city with a great number of people, met the archbiſhop's ſervants, who came to town with ſeveral carts and horſes loaded with proviſions. The governor aſked to whom they belonged; and they having anſwered they were Aldred's ſervants, the governor ordered that all theſe proviſions ſhould be carried to the king's ſtore-houſe. The archbiſhop ſent immediately ſome of his clergy to the governor, commanding him to deliver the proviſions, and to make ſatisfaction to St. Peter, and to him the ſaint's vicar, for the injury he had done them; adding, that if he refuſed to comply, the archbiſhop would make uſe of his apoſtolic authority againſt him, (inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating thereby that he would excommunicate him). The governor, offended at this proud meſſage, uſed the perſons whom the archbiſhop had ſent him very ill, and returned an anſwer as haughty as the meſſage was. Aldred thereupon went to London to make his complaint to the king; but in this very complaint he acted with his wonted inſolence; for meeting the king in the church of St. Peter at Weſtminſter, he ſpoke to him in theſe words: "Hearken, O William: when thou waſt but a foreigner, and God, to puniſh the ſins of this nation, permitted thee to become maſter of it, after having ſhed a great deal of blood, I conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated thee, and put the crown upon thy head with bleſſings; but now, becauſe thou haſt deſerved it, I pronounce a curſe over thee, inſtead of a bleſſing, ſince thou art become the perſecutor of God's church, and of his miniſters, and haſt broken the promiſes and oaths which thou madeſt to me before St. Peter's altar." The king terrified at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, fell upon his knees, and humbly begged the prelate to tell him, by what crime he had deſerved ſo ſevere a ſentence. The noblemen, who were preſent, were enraged againſt the archbiſhop, and loudly cried
<pb facs="tcp:0613800301:125"/>
out he deſerved death, or at leaſt baniſhment, for having offered ſuch an injury to his ſovereign, and they preſſed him with threatenings to raiſe the king from the ground. But the prelate, unmoved at all this, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered calmly, "Good men, let him lie there, for he is not at Aldred's but at St. Peter's feet; let him feel St. Peter's power, ſince he dared to injure his vicegerent." Having thus reproved the nobles by his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal authority, he vouchſafed to take the king by the hand, and to tell him the ground of his complaint. The king humbly excuſed himſelf, by ſaying he had been ignorant of the whole matter; and begged of the noblemen to intreat the prelate, that he might take off the curſe he had pronounced, and to change it into a bleſſing. Aldred was at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to favour the king thus far; but not without the promiſe of ſeveral preſents and favours, and only after the king had granted him to take ſuch a revenge on the governor as he thought fit. Since that time (adds the hiſtorian) none of the noblemen ever dared to offer the leaſt injury. It may be queſtioned, which was more ſurpriſing here, whether the archbiſhop's haughtineſs, who dared to treat his ſovereign after ſo unbecoming a manner; or the king's ſtupidity, who ſuffered ſuch inſolence and audaciouſneſs from a prieſt?—The Danes having made an invaſion in the north of England in the year 1068, under the command of Harold and Canute the ſons of King Swane, Aldred was ſo much afflicted at it, that he died of grief in the 11th of September in that ſame year, having beſought God that he might not ſee the deſolation of his church and country.</p>

            <head>ALDRICH (DR. HENRY),</head>
            <p>AN eminent Engliſh divine and philoſopher, born at London in 1647, was educated at Weſtminſter ſchool under the famous Dr. Buſby, and admitted of Chriſt-church college, Oxford. He had a great ſhare in the controverſy with the papiſts in the reign of James II. and biſhop Burnet ranks him among thoſe who examined all the points of popery with a ſolidity of judgment, clearneſs of argument, depth of learning, and vivacity of writing, far beyond any who had before that time written in our language. He rendered himſelf ſo conſpicuous, that at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, when Maſſey the popiſh dean of Chriſt-church fled, his deanery was conferred on him. In this ſtation he behaved in an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary manner, and that fabric owes much of its beauty to his ingenuity. It was Aldrich who deſigned the beautiful ſquare called the <hi>Peckwater-Quadrangle,</hi> which is eſteemed an excellent piece of architecture. In imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his predeceſſor Dr. Fell, he publiſhed yearly a piece of ſome anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Greek author, as a preſent to the ſtudents of his houſe. He publiſhed <hi>A Syſtem of Logic,</hi> with ſome other pieces; and the reviſing Clarendon's
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0613800301:126"/>
Hiſtory of the Rebellion was intruſted to him and biſhop Spratt: but it doth not appear that they made any additions, or conſiderable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as has been aſſerted by Mr. Oldmixon. Beſides his preferments, above mentioned, Dr. Aldrich was alſo rector of Wem in Shropſhire. He was choſen prolocutor of the convocation in 1702. This worthy perſon died at Chriſt-church, on the 14th of December 1710. As to his character, he was a moſt univerſal ſcholar, and had a taſte for all ſorts of learning, eſpecially architecture. Sir John Hawkins has favoured the public with ſeveral particulars relative to Dr. Aldrich's ſkill in muſic; and, on account of the doctor's eminence in this reſpect, Sir John hath given his life, with his head prefixed. His abilities as a muſician rank him, we are told, amongſt the greateſt maſters of the ſcience. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed many ſervices for the church, which are well known; as are alſo his anthems, nearly to the number of twenty. He adapted, with great ſkill and judgment, Engliſh words to many of the notes of Paleſtrina, Cariſſimi, Victoria, and other Italian compoſers for the church, ſome of which are frequently ſung in our cathedrals as anthems. By the happy talent which Dr. Aldrich poſſeſſed, of naturalizing the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the old Italian maſters, and accommodating them to an Engliſh ear, he increaſed the ſtores of our own church. Though the doctor chiefly applied himſelf to the cultivation of ſacred muſic, yet, being a man of humour, he could divert himſelf by producing pieces of a lighter kind. There are two catches of his; the one, "Hark, the bonny Chriſt-church Bells;" the other intitled, "a Smoking Catch," to be ſung by four men ſmoking their pipes, which is not more difficult to ſing than diverting to hear. His love of ſmoking was, it ſeems, ſo exceſſive as to be an entertaining topick of diſcourſe in the univerſity. Such was Dr. Aldrich's regard for the advancement of muſic, and the honour of its profeſſors, that he had formed a deſign of writing a hiſtory of the ſcience; and the materials from which he propoſed to compile it are yet extant in the library of his own college. It appears from theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, that he had marked down every thing he had met with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning muſic and muſicians; but that he had wrought no part of them into any kind of form.</p>

            <p>KING of Northumberland during the Saxon heptarchy, was inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurated A. D. 796. Ethelred during his reign, to ſecure himſelf on the throne, baniſhed ſeveral lords; among the reſt Aldulph. But the party who were in oppoſition to the throne ſucceeding, Ethelred was aſſaſſinated, and Oſwald elected in his room. In twenty-ſeven days he was driven out, and Aldulph placed on the throne. Two years after his acceſſion, a conſpiracy was formed againſt him, at the head of which was one Wada. The king engaged Wada's army and routed them. In 801, Aldulph led an army againſt Kenulph King of the Mercians, who had afforded ſhelter to his enemies; but through the interpoſition of the biſhops and nobles on both ſides, the monarchs were reconciled, and made a league of firm friendſhip. Notwithſtanding two powerful factions then exiſted in Northumberland, Aldulph had the addreſs to maintain himſelf on the throne. Yet many attempts were made by one of the parties, at the head of which was Alcmund ſon of Alcred, who had formerly reigned in that kingdom. This prince beginning to grow formidable, Aldulph who judged it neceſſary to ſacrifice him to his own ſafety, procured him to be privately murdered.

            <head>ALEMBERT (JOHN LE ROND D'),</head>
            <p>AN eminent French philoſopher, was born at Paris in 1717, He derived the name of John le Rond from that of the church near which, after his birth, he was expoſed as a foundling. His father, informed of this circumſtance, liſtened to the voice of nature and duty, took mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for the proper education of his child, and for his future ſubſiſtence in a ſtate of eaſe and independence.</p>
            <p>He received his firſt education in the college of the Four Nations, among the Janſeniſts, where he gave early marks of capacity and genius. In the firſt year of his philoſophical ſtudies, he compoſed a commentary on the epiſtle of St. Paul to the Romans. The Janſeniſts conſidered this production as an omen that portended to the party of Port-Royal a reſtoration to ſome part of their ancient ſplendor, and hoped to find one day in M. d'Alembert a ſecond Paſcal. To render this reſemblance more complete, they engaged their riſing pupil in the ſtudy of mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics; but they ſoon perceived that his growing attachment to this ſcience was likely to diſappoint the hopes they had formed with reſpect to his future deſtination: they, therefore, endeavoured to divert him from this line; but their endeavours were fruitleſs.</p>
            <p>At his leaving the college, he found himſelf alone and unconnected in the world; and ſought an aſylum in the houſe of his <hi>nurſe.</hi> He comforted himſelf with the hope, that his fortune, though not ample, would better the condition and ſubſiſtence of that family, which was the only one that he could conſider as his own: here, therefore, he took up his reſidence, reſolving to apply himſelf entirely to the ſtudy of goe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry. And here he lived, during the ſpace of forty years, with the greateſt ſimplicity, diſcovering the augmentation of his means only by increaſing diſplays of his beneficence, concealing his growing reputation and celebrity from theſe honeſt people, and making their plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth manners the ſubject of good-natured pleaſantry and philoſophical obſervation. His good nurſe perceived his ardent activity; heard him mentioned as the writer of many books; but never took it into her head that he was a great man, and rather beheld him with a kind of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. "<hi>You will never,</hi>" ſaid ſhe to him one day, "<hi>be any thing but a philoſopher—and what is a philoſopher?—a fool, who toils and plagues himſelf during his life, that people may talk of him when</hi> HE IS NO MORE."</p>
            <p>As M. d'Alembert's fortune did not far exceed the demands of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, his friends adviſed him to think of a profeſſion that might enable him to augment it. He accordingly turned his views to the law, and took his degrees in that line; but ſoon abandoned this plan, and applied to the ſtudy of medicine. Geometry, however, was always drawing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0613800301:129"/>
him back to his former purſuits, and after many ineffectual efforts to reſiſt its attractions, he renounced all views of a lucrative profeſſion, and gave himſelf over entirely to mathematics and poverty.</p>
            <p>In the year 1741, he was admitted member of the academy of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; for which diſtinguiſhed literary promotion, at ſuch an early age, he had prepared the way by correcting the errors of a celebrated work, which was deemed <hi>claſſical</hi> in France in the line of geometry. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſet himſelf to examine, with deep attention and aſſiduity, what muſt be the motion of a body which paſſes from one fluid into another more denſe, in a direction not perpendicular to the ſurface ſeparating the two fluids. Every one knows the phenomenon which happens in this caſe, and which amuſes children under the denomination of <hi>duck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and drakes</hi>; but M. d'Alembert was the firſt who explained it in a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory and philoſophical manner.</p>
            <p>Two years after his election to a place in the academy, he publiſhed his <hi>Treatiſe on Dynamics.</hi> The new principle developed in this treatiſe conſiſted in eſtabliſhing equality, at each inſtant, between the changes that the motion of a body has undergone, and the forces or powers which have been employed to produce them; or to expreſs them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in ſeparating into <hi>two parts</hi> the action of the moving powers, and conſidering the <hi>one</hi> as producing alone the motion of the body, in the ſecond inſtant, and the <hi>other</hi> as employed to deſtroy that which it had in the firſt.</p>
            <p>So early as the year 1744, M. d'Alembert had applied this principle to the theory of the equilibrium, and the motion of fluids; and all the problems before ſolved by geometricians became, in ſome meaſure, in corollaries. The diſcovery of this new principle was followed by that of a new calculus, the firſt trials of which were publiſhed in a <hi>Diſcourſe on the general Theory of the Winds,</hi> to which the prize-medal was adjudged by the academy of Berlin in the year 1746, and which was a new and brilliant addition to the fame of M. d'Alembert. This new calculus of partial differences he applied, the year following, to the problem of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating chords, whoſe ſolution, as well as the theory of the oſcillation of the air and the propagation of ſound, had been given but incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely by the geometricians who preceded him, and theſe were hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In 1752, M. d'Alembert publiſhed a treatiſe on the <hi>Reſiſtance of Fluid</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0613800301:130"/>
to which he gave the modeſt title of an <hi>Eſſay;</hi> but which contains a multitude of original ideas and new obſervations. About the ſame time, he publiſhed, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, <hi>Reſearches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Integral Calculus,</hi> which is greatly indebted to him for the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid progreſs it has made in the preſent century.</p>
            <p>While the ſtudies of M. d'Alembert were confined to goemetry, he was little known or celebrated in his native country. His connections were limited to a ſmall ſociety of ſelect friends: he had never ſeen any man in high office except Meſſrs d'Argenſon. Satisfied with an income which furniſhed him with the neceſſaries of life, he did not aſpire after opulence or honours, nor had they been hitherto beſtowed upon him, as it is eaſier to confer them on thoſe who ſolicit them, than to look out for men who deſerve them. His chearful converſation, his ſmart and lively ſallies, a happy knack at telling a ſtory, a ſingular mixture of malice of ſpeech with goodneſs of heart, and of delicacy of wit with ſimplicity of manners, rendered him a pleaſing and intereſting compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and his company conſequently was much ſought after in the faſhionable circles. His reputation, at length, made its way to the throne, and rendered him the object of royal attention and beneficence. He received alſo a penſion from government, which he owed to the friendſhip of Count d'Argenſon.</p>
            <p>The tranquillity of M. d'Alembert was abated when his fame grew more extenſive, and when it was known beyond the circle of his friends, that a fine and enlightened genius for literature and philoſophy accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied his mathematical genius. Our author's eulogiſt aſcribes to envy, detraction, and to other motives nearly as ungenerous, all the diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, oppoſition, and cenſure that M. d'Alembert met with on account of the publication of the famous Encyclopedical Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, in conjunction with Diderot. None ſurely will refuſe the juſt tribute of applauſe to the eminent diſplays of genius, judgment, and true literary taſte, with which M. d'Alembert has enriched the great work now mentioned. Among others, the Preliminary Diſcourſe he has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to it, concerning the riſe, progreſs, connections, and affinities of all the branches of human knowledge, is perhaps one of the moſt capital productions of which the philoſophy of the preſent age can boaſt. Nor will it be diſputed, that the maſter-builders of this new and ſtupendous temple of ſcience, for the worſhip of Nature, had alſo really in view the advancement of human knowledge, and the improvement of the arts and ſciences. This, no true, no candid philoſopher, will call in queſtion. But that in the <hi>inner court</hi> of this temple there was a confederacy formed againſt all thoſe who looked higher than <hi>nature,</hi> for the principal object
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0613800301:131"/>
of their veneration and confidence, is a fact too palpable, nay too boldly avowed, to ſtand in need of any proof.</p>
            <p>Some time after this, d'Alembert publiſhed his Philoſophical, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, and Philological Miſcellanies: theſe were followed by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of Chriſtina Queen of Sweden; in which M. d'Alembert ſhowed that he was acquainted with the natural rights of mankind, and was bold enough to aſſert them. His <hi>Eſſay on the Intercourſe of Men of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with Perſons high in Rank and Office,</hi> wounded the former to the quick, as it expoſed to the eyes of the public the ignominy of thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile chains, which they feared to ſhake off, or were proud to wear. A lady of the court hearing one day the author accuſed of having exaggerated the deſpotiſm of the great, and the ſubmiſſion they require, anſwered ſlyly, <hi>If he had conſulted me, I would have told him ſtill more of the matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>M. d'Alembert gave very elegant ſpecimens of his literary abilities in his tranſlations of ſome ſelect pieces of Tacitus. But theſe occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did not divert him from his mathematical ſtudies; for about the ſame time he enriched the Encyclopédie with a multitude of excellent articles in that line, and compoſed his <hi>Reſearches on ſeveral important Points of the Syſtem of the World,</hi> in which he carried to a higher degree of perfection the ſolution of the problem of the perturbations of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, that had ſeveral years before been preſented to the academy.</p>
            <p>In 1759, he publiſhed his <hi>Elements of Philoſophy</hi>; a work extolled as remarkable for its preciſion and perſpicuity; in which, however, are ſome tenets relative both to metaphyſics and moral ſcience, that are far from being admiſſible.</p>
            <p>The reſentment that was kindled (and the diſputes that followed it) by the article <hi>Geneva,</hi> inſerted in the Encyclopédie, are well known. M. d'Alembert did not leave this field of controverſy with flying co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Voltaire was an auxiliary in the conteſt; but as, in point of candour and decency, he had no reputation to loſe; and as he weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the blows of his enemies, by throwing both them and the ſpectator into fits of laughter, the iſſue of the war gave him little uneaſineſs.

            <p>In the year 1765, he publiſhed his <hi>Diſſertation on the Deſtruction of the Jeſuiſts.</hi> This piece drew upon him a ſwarm of adverſaries, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the merit and credit of his work by their manner of attacking it.</p>
            <p>Beſide the works already mentioned, he publiſhed nine volumes of memoirs and treatiſes, under the title of <hi>Opuſcules</hi>; in which he has ſolved a multitude of problems relative to aſtronomy, mathematics, and natural philoſophy; of which our panegyriſt gives a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, more eſpecially of thoſe which exhibit new ſubjects, or new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of inveſtigation.</p>
            <p>He publiſhed alſo <hi>Elements of Muſic</hi>; and rendered, at length, the ſyſtem of Rameau intelligible; but he did not think the mathematical theory of the ſonorous body ſufficient to account for the rules of that art. He was always fond of muſic; which, on the one hand, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the moſt ſubtle and learned reſearches of rational mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics; while, on the other, its power over the ſenſes and the ſoul exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits to philoſophers phenomena no leſs ſingular, and ſtill more inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</p>
            <p>In the year 1772, he was choſen ſecretary to the French academy. He formed, ſoon after this preferment, the deſign of writing the lives of all the deceaſed academicians, from 1700 to 1772; and in the ſpace three years he executed this deſign, by compoſing 70 eulogies.</p>
            <p>M. d'Alembert died on the 29th of October, 1783. There were many amiable lines of candour, modeſty, diſintereſtedneſs, and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, in his moral character; which are deſcribed, with a diffuſive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, in his eulogium, by M.

            <head>ALEXANDER THE GREAT,</head>
            <p>KING of Macedon. His father Philip laid the plan of that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive empire, which his ſon afterwards executed. Philip, having made himſelf maſter of Greece, began to caſt his eyes upon Perſia, with a view to retaliate upon that haughty empire the injuries of former times. It was the popular topic of the day. But this prince was cut off in the midſt of his enterpriſe. Such, however, was the influence of Alexander in the aſſembly of the Grecian ſtates, that he was created general of their combined forces in the room of his father. Having made every needful preparation, at the head of a veteran army he invaded Aſia. The lieutenants of Darius, who was then king of Perſia, oppoſed him at the river Granicus, where Alexander obtained a complete victory, after
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0613800301:133"/>
which he purſued his march through Aſia. At Iſſus, near Scanderoon, he was met by Darius in perſon, at the head of a prodigious army. Here he obtained a ſecond victory; and took the camp of Darius, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his family, whom he treated with the utmoſt humanity. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the maxims of war, inſtead of purſuing Darius, he made an excurſion into Egypt; and, as far as appears, through no better motives than thoſe of vanity. Here he was acknowledged to be the ſon of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Ammon. In the mean time Darius recruited his ſtrength, and got together an army ſuperior to what he brought into the plain of Iſſus, Alexander having finiſhed his Egyptian expedition, traverſed Aſia, and paſſed the Euphrates. At Arbella, a town in Aſſyria, he met Darius. Here a deciſive battle was fought, which put all Perſia into the hands of Alexander. His ambition not being ſatisfied with the conqueſt of that vaſt country, he projected an expedition into India. Here he met with great oppoſition from Porus, a gallant prince, whom in the end he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Beyond the Ganges lay a country ſtill unſubdued. He notified it to his army, that he propoſed to paſs the river. But theſe veterans, haraſſed with the fatigues, and ſeeing no end of their labour, mutinied, and refuſed to march further. The diſappointed chief was therefore obliged to return. At Babylon he propoſed to receive ambaſſadors, appoint governors, and ſettle his vaſt monarchy; but his exceſſes put an and to his life in the midſt of his deſigns, and in the flower of his age.</p>
            <p>The character of this hero is ſo familiar to every body, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt needleſs labour to draw it. All the world knows, ſays Mr. Bayle, that it was equally compoſed of very great virtues and very great vices. He had no mediocrity in any thing but his ſtature: in his other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whether good or bad, he was all extremes. His ambition roſe even to madneſs. His father was not at all miſtaken in ſuppoſing the bounds of Macedon too ſmall for his ſon: for how could Macedon bound the ambition of a man, who reckoned the world too ſmall a dominion? He wept at hearing the philoſopher Anaxarchus ſay, that there was an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of worlds: his tears were owing to his deſpair of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all, ſince he had not yet been able to conquer one. Livy, in a ſhort digreſſion, has attempted to inquire into the events which might have happened, if Alexander, after the conqueſt of Aſia, had brought his arms into Italy? Doubtleſs things might have taken a very different turn with him; and all the grand projects, which ſucceeded ſo well againſt an effeminate Perſian monarch, might eaſily have miſcarried if he had to do with rough hardy Roman armies. And yet the vaſt aims of this mighty conqueror, if ſeen under another point of view, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have been confined in a very narrow compaſs; ſince, as we are told, the utmoſt wiſh of that great heart, for which the whole earth was
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0613800301:134"/>
not big enough, was, after all, to be praiſed by the Athenians: for it is related, that the difficulties which he encountered in order to paſs the Hydaſpes, forced him to cry out,
<q rend="inline">"O Athenians, could you believe to what dangers I expoſe myſelf for the ſake of being celebrated by you?"</q>
But Bayle affirms, that this was quite conſiſtent with the vaſt unbounded extent of his ambition, as he wanted to make all future time his own, and be an object of admiration to the lateſt poſterity; yet did not expect this from the conqueſt of worlds, but from books.
<q rend="inline">"He was perfectly in the right; ſays Bayle; "for if Greece had not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with good writers, he would long ago have been as much forgotten as the kings who reigned in Macedon before Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryon."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alexander has been praiſed upon the ſcore of continency, yet his life could not ſurely be quite regular in that reſpect. Indeed, the fire of his early youth appeared ſo cold towards women, that his mother ſuſpected him to be impotent; and, to ſatisfy herſelf in this point, did, with the conſent of Philip, procure a very handſome courtezan to lie with him, whoſe careſſes, however, were all to no purpoſe. His behaviour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Perſian captives ſhows him to have had a great command over himſelf in this particular. The wife of Darius was a finiſhed beauty; her daughters likewiſe were all beauties; yet this young prince, who had them in his power, not only beſtowed on them all the honours due to their high rank, but managed their reputation with the utmoſt delicacy. They were kept as in a cloyſter concealed from the world, and ſecured from the reach of every diſhonourable (not only attack, but) imputation. He did not give the leaſt handle to ſcandal, either by his viſits, his looks, or his words: and for other Perſian dames his priſoners, equally beautiful in face and ſhape, he contented himſelf with ſaying gaily, that they gave indeed much pain to his eyes. The amazon Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtris could not obtain from him a compliance with her gallant requeſt till after a delay of thirteen days. In the mean time, what are we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from his cauſing his favourite miſtreſs Pancaſte to be drawn naked by Apelles, though it is true he gave her to the painter, who fell in love with her? What of that immoderate love of boys, which Athenaeus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of him? What of that prodigious number of wives and concubines which he kept?</p>
            <p>His exceſſes with regard to wine were notorious, and beyond all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; and he committed, when drunk, a thouſand extravagancies. It was owing to wine, that he killed Clytus who ſaved his life, and burnt Perſepolis, one of the moſt beautiful cities of the Eaſt: he did this laſt indeed at the inſtigation of the courtezan Thais; but this circumſtance made it only the more heinous. It is generally believed, that he died
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0613800301:135"/>
by drinking immoderately: and even Plutarch, who affects to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it, owns that he did nothing but drink the whole day he was taken ill.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, to ſum up the character of this prince, we cannot be of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that his good qualities did in any wiſe compenſate for his bad ones. Heroes make a noiſe: their actions glare, and ſtrike the ſenſes forcibly; while the infinite deſtruction and miſery they occaſion lies more in the ſhade, and out of ſight. One good legiſlator is worth all the heroes that ever did or will exiſt.</p>

            <p>AN indefatigable writer of the 17th century, born at Roan in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, 1639. After finiſhing his ſtudies at Roan, he entered into the order of Dominican friars, and was profeſſed there in 1655. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he went to Paris, to go through a courſe of philoſophy and divinity in the great convent, where he diſtinguiſhed himſelf ſo, that he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to teach philoſophy there, which he did for twelve years. Mr. Colbert ſhowed him many marks of his eſteem; and being determined to omit nothing to perfect the education of his ſon, afterwards archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Roan, he formed an aſſembly of the moſt learned perſons, whoſe conferences upon eccleſiaſtical hiſtory might be of advantage to him. Father Alexander was invited to this aſſembly, where he exerted himſelf with ſo much genius and ability, that he gained the particular friendſhip of young Colbert, who ſhowed him the utmoſt regard as long as he lived. Theſe conferences gave riſe to Alexander's deſign of writing an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical hiſtory; for, being deſired to reduce what was material in theſe conferences to writing, he did it with ſo much accuracy, that the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men who compoſed this aſſembly, adviſed him to undertake a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete body of church-hiſtory. This he executed with great aſſiduity, collecting and digeſting the materials himſelf, and writing even the tables with his own hand. He at laſt completed his work in 1686. Towards the latter part of his life, he was afflicted with the loſs of his fight; a moſt inexpreſſible misfortune to one whoſe whole pleaſure was in ſtudy, yet he bore it with great patience and reſignation. He died merely of a decay of nature, 1724, in the 86th year of his age.</p>

            <head>ALEXANDER (WILLIAM),</head>
            <p>AN eminent ſtateſman and poet of Scotland in the reigns of James I. and Charles I. His ſurname is ſaid to have been taken from the proper name of his predeceſſor Alexander Macdonald, who, under the family of Argyle held the lands of Menſtris. Andrew Alexander in the reign of James V. is the firſt of the name mentioned in the records of Scotland. From him our William is deſcended. He was born in 1580. He
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0613800301:138"/>
ſoon diſcovered conſpicuous parts, which made his friends deſirous to improve them to the utmoſt, by a liberal education, and was ſo much diſtinguiſhed for both, that he was recommended as tutor, or rather companion to the Earl of Argyle. After ſome time ſpent in foreign parts he returned to Scotland, and betook himſelf a while to a rural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. Here he finiſhed his poetical complaint of the unſucceſsful addreſs he had made to his firſt miſtreſs, which he entitled <hi>Aurora.</hi> After his return this courtſhip was revived, and he wrote above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſonnets upon it. The lady marrying ſoon after, he removed to the court of King James VI. and lived there in the capacity of a private gentleman, but with the character of a learned and accompliſhed one. Here he ſtill found occaſion to exerciſe his poetical talents, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him much to the King. The poetry Alexander now turned his mind to was of a more ſublime kind than that which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly wrote; he now held the mirror up to kings and princes, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to animate the precepts of philoſophy, and to render its graveſt leſſons affecting. He formed his works on the plan of the Greek and Roman tragedies. And in 1600, he publiſhed at Edinburgh a tragedy upon the ſtory of Darius. In this, and in his other plays, his meaſure is alternate rhyme: his ſtyle is not always ſound, for which, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face he pleads his country. This was the year after reprinted at London, without the preface, but with two poems of our author's; one congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the King upon his entry into England, the other written after an inundation which happened at Dover, a place where his majeſty uſed to amuſe himſelf with hawking.</p>
            <p>In the ſame year his Paraeneſis to Prince Henry was alſo publiſhed. In this poem, he ſhews how the happineſs of the prince depends on the choice of his counſellors. He ſhews alſo the uſe of hiſtory, and how the lives of great men are to be read with profit. Whether our author had yet arrived in England does not appear, or whether he publiſhed any thing more before the year 1609 we have not learned; but in that year came out his three other plays, which, with that before-mentioned, are entitled the Monarchie Tragedies: Croeſus, Darius, the Alexandrian Julius Caeſar; by William Alexander, gentleman of the prince's privy-chamber, and with them are bound the above-mentioned poems. They are dedicated to King James in a poem of thirteen ſtanzas. King James is ſaid to have been delighted with theſe plays, and with our author's converſation. Many authors have ſpoken highly of theſe tragedies.</p>
            <p>Not long after, Mr. Alexander publiſhed a ſupplement to Sir Philip Sidney's celebrated romance, which is to be found in the fourth, and ſubſequent editions of that work, with the initials of his name to it. This was a proper exerciſe for his muſe. In the ſame year, 1613, we find him
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0613800301:139"/>
mentioned to have been ſworn in one of the gentlemen uſhers of the preſence to Prince Charles.</p>
            <p>His muſe now laboured with a poem of a different kind. He brought forth a ſacred poem, called Doomſday, or the Great Day of the Lord's Judgment; it was firſt printed at Edinburgh, in 4to, in 1614, and afterwards in the folio edition of his works. It is divided into twelve books, or hours, as the author calls them. The firſt book was repr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nted by a Mr. Johnſtoun, who tells us the work had received the approbation of Mr. Addiſon. In the year above-mentioned, the King made him maſter of the requeſts, and conferred on him the honour of knighthood.</p>
            <p>From this time he commenced a man of buſineſs, and became ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of poſſeſſing a ſpacious eſtate. He projected the ſettlement of a large c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lony in Nova Scotia, at the expence of ſuch adventurers as ſhould be engaged in the undertaking. His majeſty made him a grant of that country, and intended to create an order of baronets for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſupport of ſo great a work; but the jealouſies which exiſted in the latter part of this reign, ſuſpended the execution of it. King Charles I. on his coming to the crown, was very forward to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it; as it appeared from a pamphlet publiſhed by Sir William, entitled "An Encouragement to Colonies," to promiſe great advantages to the nation. The king made Sir William Alexander, Lieutenant of Nova Scotia, and founded in the firſt year of his reign the order of Knights Baronets of Scotland, whoſe aid was appropriated for the ſaid plantation and ſettlement, upon conſideration of each having a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral portion of land allotted him there.

            <p>AN elegant hiſtorical poet, in the reign of Charles I. His works, though written above a century, ſtill preſerve a reputation. He was educated at Sidney College, Cambridge; and afterwards acted as uſher to the celebrated grammarian and commentator Thomas Farnaby, at his ſchool, near Redcroſs-ſtreet. Early in the reign of Charles, he exerciſed his genius on a very heroical ſubject, the two glorious victories obtained by the Engliſh in France, under the title of

How long our author continued in this ſituation we know not; but he during that time brought forth an elaborate poem in honour of Henry VII. and the important battle of Boſworth.

            <head>ALI BEY,</head>
            <p>A MAN who has acted a moſt diſtinguiſhed part againſt the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire in this century, was born in Natolia in 1728, and received at his birth the name of Joſeph. His father was a Greek prieſt, of a diſtinguiſhed family, who educated him with great care, deſigning him to ſucceed him: but, at thirteen years of age, Joſeph being hunting in a neighbouring foreſt, robbers fell on his company, and carried him off to Grand Cairo: here he was ſold to Ibrahim, a lieutenant of the jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, who had him circumciſed, clothed him in the dreſs of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malukes, and called him Ali: he gave him maſters in the Turkiſh and Arabic languages, and in horſemanſhip; and, by kind treatment, made him by degrees ſatisfied with his new ſtation. In a courſe of years, he ſucceeded in theſe languages, ſhewed wonderful dexterity in the uſe of his arms, and became ſo dear to his maſter, that he raiſed him rapidly in his houſehold, and created him a <hi>cachef</hi> or governor, at the age of twenty-two.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0613800301:142"/>In this ſtation, he manifeſted his equity and good adminiſtration of juſtice, improved the diſcipline of the Mamalukes, and laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his future greatneſs. Here he gained the favour of the pacha Rahiph, who, diſcovering his merit, became his protector. He remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral years in this ſtation, until his patron Ibrahim was elected emir al hagi, or prince of the caravan, who took him with him to eſcort the pilgrims: in their march they were attacked by the Arabs; Ali fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them at the head of the Mamalukes, repulſed the enemy, and killed a great number on the ſpot. On his return, ſeveral tribes being col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, were determined to avenge their defeat: the young cachef gave them battle, and obtained a ſignal victory. Ibrahim did juſtice to the ſervices of his lieutenant in full council, and propoſed to create him a ſangiak. Ibrahim the Circaſſian oppoſed it with all his might; but the emir al hagi prevailed; Ali was nominated by the divan: the pacha con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this choice, clothed him with a caftan, and gave him the firmaun of bey.</p>
            <p>Become now one of the members of the republic, he never forgot his obligations to his patron. In 1758, the emir al hagi was murdered by the party of Ibrahim the Circaſſian. From this moment, Ali meditated vengeance: he concealed his reſentment, and employed all the reſources of his mind to arrive at the poſt of ſcheik elbalad, the firſt dignity of the republic. In 1763, he attained that poſt; and ſoon after revenged the blood of his patron, by ſacrificing Ibrahim the Circaſſian with his own hand. This action raiſed him up numerous enemies: the ſangiaks, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the party of the Circaſſian, conſpired againſt him; he was on the point of being murdered, but ſaved himſelf by flight, and repaired to Jeruſalem. Having gained the eſteem of the governor of that city, he thought himſelf in ſafety; but his enemies fearing him even in exile, wrote to the Porte to demand his death; and orders were immediately ſent to the governor to ſtrike off his head. Fortunately, Rahiph, his old friend, was one of the divan, and gave him notice to fly from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: Ali therefore anticipated the arrival of the capigi bachi, and took refuge with ſcheik Daker, prince of St. John of Acre.</p>
            <p>This reſpectable old man received him with open arms: he was not long in diſcovering the merit of his new gueſt, and from that moment loaded him with careſſes; he exhorted him to bear adverſity with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, flattered his hopes, ſoothed his ſorrows, and made him taſte of pleaſures even in his diſgrace. Ali Bey might have paſſed his days hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily with ſcheik Daker; but ambition would not permit him to remain inactive; he carried on a ſecret correſpondence with ſome of the ſangiaks attached to his intereſt. The prince of Acre, on his part, wrote to his friends at Grand Cairo, and urged them to haſten the recal of the ſcheik
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0613800301:143"/>
elbalad. While this was going on, Rahiph, now grand vizier, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him to be invited to return to Grand Cairo, and reſume his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: he ſet off immediately, and was received with the acclamations of the people. On all ſides the ſtorm was gathering around him: all thoſe who were offended at the murder of Ibrahim the Circaſſian were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly laying ſnares for him; they only waited a favourable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: the death of Rahiph, which happened in 1763, furniſhed them with it; they threw off the maſk, and declared openly againſt him. He eſcaped into Arabia Felix, viſited the coaſts of the Red Sea, and once more took refuge with the ſcheik of Acre, who received him with the ſame tenderneſs. Whilſt he was there, the ſangiaks of the party of the Circaſſian perſecuted thoſe who were devoted to the intereſts of Ali. This imprudence opened the eyes of the majority; they perceived that they were the dupes of a few ambitious men; and, to ſtrengthen their party, recalled the ſcheik elbalad, and promiſed to ſupport him with all their power: he ſet off immediately. On his return to Grand Cairo, in 1766, Ali held a council: he repreſented to them that moderation had only excited the friends of Ibrahim to revenge; that nothing but flight would have ſaved him from their plots; and that, to ſecure the common ſafety, theſe turbulent ſpirits muſt be ſacrificed. The whole aſſembly applauded this reſolution; and, the next day, they took off the heads of four of them. This execution inſured the tranquillity of Ali: he ſaw himſelf at the head of the government; and, in the ſpace of ſix years, raiſed ſixteen of his Mamalukes to the dignity of beys, and one of them to that of aga of the janiſaries.</p>
            <p>Supreme chief of the republic, he adopted every meaſure to render his power durable: not content with increaſing his Mamalukes to ſix thouſand, he took into pay ten thouſand Mograbi: he cauſed his troops to obſerve the moſt rigid diſcipline, and, by continual exerciſe, made them good ſoldiers. He attached the young men of his houſehold to him, by the paternal attention he paid to their education, and above all by beſtowing favours and rewards on thoſe who were the moſt worthy. His party became ſo powerful, that ſuch of his colleagues as were not his friends dreaded his power, nor dared to thwart his projects. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving his authority eſtabliſhed on a ſolid baſis, he turned his attention to the welfare of his people: the Arabs, diſperſed over the deſarts, and on the frontiers of Egypt, committed ravages not to be ſuppreſſed by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctuating government: he declared war, and ſent againſt them bodies of cavalry, which beat them every where, and drove them back into the depth of their ſolitudes. Egypt began to reſpire, and agriculture, encouraged, flouriſhed once more in that rich country. Having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the chief of each village reſponſible for the crimes of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0613800301:144"/>
he puniſhed them until the authors of the offence were delivered into the hands of juſtice. In this manner, the principal citizens looked after the public ſafety; and, for the firſt time ſince the commencement of the Turkiſh empire, the traveller and merchant could paſs through the whole extent of the kingdom without the apprehenſion of an inſult.</p>
            <p>The ſcheik elbalad unfortunately accumulated favours on Mahomed Abou Dahab, a traitor, who ſecretly aſpired to the ſovereign power. The ſangiaks bribed him to put the ſcheik out of the way; but fearing for his own life, he deferred it, and kept the gold: to increaſe the confidence of his friend, he diſcovered the conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>In 1768, the Ruſſians declared war againſt the Porte: the ſcheik ſent twelve thouſand men to ſerve in the Turkiſh army. Even this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of duty was made uſe of to his diſadvantage; and it was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented at Conſtantinople, that theſe troops were deſigned to ſerve in the Ruſſian army: the calumny was credited, and a capigi, with four at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, ſent to take off his head. Ali had intelligence by his friends, and diſpatched a confident, with twelve Mamalukes, who ſeized the capigi and his attendants, took from them their order, and put them to death. The whole will ſhew us by how precarious a tenure life is held in the Ottoman empire. The ſcheik, poſſeſſed of this order, aſſembled the chiefs, and laid before them the deſpotiſm of the Ottoman court. This had the deſired effect; ſixteen of the beys exclaimed, that war ought to be declared againſt the Grand Signior. The Turkiſh pacha was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to quit Egypt: and the ſcheik ſecured the aſſiſtance of the prince of Acre.</p>
            <p>Ali levied two armies; of one he gave the command to his brother Abou Dahab, to attack Arabia Felix, and the interior provinces; the other, to Iſmaël, to attack the maritime towns: he alſo equipped a good fleet for the Red Sea. Mean time, he remained at home, attentive to the internal police of the kingdom. He reformed the cuſtom-houſe, granted immunities to the European merchants, encouraged commerce, protected the caravans, and the inland merchants. He was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reaped the fruits of his wiſe adminiſtration; Egypt was relieved, the public ſafety eſtabliſhed, and agriculture encouraged.</p>
            <p>Mean time, Abou Dahab conquered Yemen, depoſed the ſcheriff of Mecca, and ſubſtituted in his place emir Abdalla, who, to pay his court to Ali, gratified him with the title of Sultan of Egypt. Iſmaël made himſelf maſter of all the towns on the eaſtern ſhore of the Arabian gulf.</p>
            <p>In 1771, Ali ſent Abou Dahab with forty thouſand men to attempt the conqueſt of Syria, and wrote to Count Orlow, the Ruſſian admiral, then at Leghorn, making him large offers to form an alliance with him.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0613800301:145"/>
The Count in return thanked him, wiſhed him ſucceſs, and made him great promiſes, which were never realized. He alſo negociated with Venice, promiſing to aſſiſt her to retake her poſſeſſions from the Turks, but the Republic declined this bold enterprize.</p>
            <p>Abou Dahab took ſome towns of Syria, and drove the Ottomans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. This wretch had long meditated the ruin of Ali, his patron and his friend. He had accepted the command of the army, in order to gain it to his intereſt. Having ſecured them, he erected the ſtandard of rebellion, withdrew the garriſons from the conquered places, and re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Egypt. Not daring to attack the capital, he kept along the Red Sea, croſſed the Deſerts, and entered Upper Egypt. His revolt was now manifeſt, he gained the beys who commanded there, and marched towards Cairo.</p>
            <p>Ali repented his placing the command in the hands of a traitor. He collected an army, which he entruſted to Iſmaël Bey, who likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him and joined Abou Dahab.</p>
            <p>Ali, by the advice of his friends, determined to retire to St. John of Acre. He wrote to Count Orlow for aſſiſtance; and in the middle of the night, accompanied by the beys his friends, and 7000 troops, he left Cairo, and fled acroſs the Deſerts. He reached Gaza, but from agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, was taken very ill: in this ſituation the venerable ſcheik Daher came to viſit him, conſoled him that his ſituation was not deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and that the Ruſſian ſquadron was at hand. With this conſolation, and the aſſiſtance of a Ruſſian phyſician, in a few weeks he recovered.</p>
            <p>A Ruſſian ſquadron appearing before Acre, he wrote again to Count Orlow for aſſiſtance; and ſent alſo an ambaſſador to the Empreſs. In Auguſt, 1772, Ali took Jaffa and Rama. Theſe ſucceſſes inſpired him with the hope of returning to Cairo. The chiefs of the Janiſaries in that capital alſo invited him to do ſo. Therefore collecting the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the conquered towns, he began his march with 2250 Mamalukes, 3400 Mograbi, and 650 horſe.</p>
            <p>Abou Dahab met him with 12,000 men, and was defeated. Abou, by inſtilling into the minds of the Mahomedans, that Ali deſigned to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their religion, and introduce Chriſtianity, procured an army of 20,000 men. The Janiſaries, however, refuſed to join him.</p>
            <p>Ali was unprepared for this event, he abandoned himſelf to deſpair, and fell dangerouſly ill. His friends adviſed him to retire to St. John of Acre, but he declared he would ſooner periſh than retreat an inch.</p>
            <p>On the 13th of April, 1773, the armies met. Both parties charged with fury, and notwithſtanding the inferiority of Ali's troops, they had at firſt the advantage; but the Mograbi, corrupted by the promiſes of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0613800301:146"/>
Abou Dahab, deſerted, and the fortune of the day was changed. Moſt of Ali's friends fell round him; the ſurvivors preſſed him to retire, but he replied, that his hour was come. The Mamalukes bravely periſhed with their arms in their hands. Ali ſlew two ſoldiers who attempted to ſeize him; and the lieutenant of Abou Dahab advancing, Ali, though wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with two balls, ſhot him with a piſtol. He fought like a lion; but being beat down by the back ſtroke of a ſabre, was ſeized and carried to the tent of the conqueror, where he died of his wounds eight days after.</p>
            <p>Ali was of the middle ſize, his carriage noble, and his character open and generous: he poſſeſſed an inſurmountable courage, and a lofty ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. He died the victim of an ill-placed friendſhip. Had Ruſſia availed herſelf of his offers, ſhe might have ſecured to herſelf the commerce of Arabia. He was only 45 years of age when he died. The Egyptians long mourned his loſs; and ſaw themſelves again plunged into all the miſeries from which he had delivered them.</p>

            <head>ALLATIUS (LEO),</head>
            <p>KEEPER of the Vatican library, a native of Scio, and a celebrated writer of the 17th century. He was of great ſervice to the gentlemen of Port Royal in the controverſy they had with M. Claude, touching the belief of the Greeks with regard to the euchariſt. No Latin was ever more devoted to the ſee of Rome, or more inveterate againſt the Greek ſchiſmatics, than Allatius. He never engaged in matrimony, nor was he ever in orders; and Pope Alexander VII. having aſked him one day, why he did not enter into orders; he anſwered,
<q rend="inline">"Becauſe I would be free to marry."</q>
The pope rejoined,
<q rend="inline">"If ſo, why do you not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey?"</q>
—<q rend="inline">"Becauſe," replied Allatius,
"I would be at liberty to take orders."</q>
Thus, as Mr. Bayle obſerves, he paſſed his whole life, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering betwixt a pariſh and a wife; ſorry, perhaps, at his death, for having choſen neither of them; when, if he had fixed upon one, he might have repented his choice for 30 or 40 years.—If we believe John Patricius, Allatius had a very extraordinary pen, with which, and no other, he wrote Greek for 40 years; and we need not be ſurpriſed, that, when he loſt it, he was ſo grieved, that he could ſcarce forbear crying. He publiſhed ſeveral manuſcripts, ſeveral tranſlations of Greek authors, and ſeveral pieces of his own compoſing. In his compoſitions he is thought to ſhow more erudition than judgment: he uſed alſo to make frequent digreſſions from one ſubject to another. He died at Rome in 1669, aged 83.</p>

Caracci, who flouriſhed 50 years after him, ſtudied and adopted his manner in preference to that of any other maſter. In a letter to his couſin Louis, he expreſſes with great warmth the impreſſion which was made on him by the firſt ſight of Corregio's paintings:
<q rend="inline">"Every thing which I ſee here," ſays he, "aſtoniſhes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e; particularly the colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the beauty of the children. They live—they breathe—They ſmile with ſo much grace and ſo much reality, that it is impoſſible to refrain from ſmiling and partaking of their enjoyment. My heart is ready to break with grief when I think on the unhappy fate of poor Corregio—that ſo wonderful a man (if he ought not rather to be called an angel) ſhould finiſh his days ſo miſerably, in a country where his talents were never known!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>From want of curioſity or of reſolution, or from want of patronage, Corregio never viſited Rome, but remained his whole life at Parma, where the art of painting was little eſteemed, and of conſequence poorly rewarded. This concurrence of unfavourable circumſtances occaſioned at laſt his premature death, at the age of 40. He was employed to paint the cupola of the cathedral at Parma, the ſubject of which is an aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Virgin; and having executed it in a manner that has long been the admiration of every perſon of good taſte, for the grandeur of deſign, and eſpecially for the boldneſs of the fore-ſhortenings (an art which he firſt and at once brought to the utmoſt perfection), he went to receive his payment. The canons of the church, either through ignorance or baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, found fault with his work; and although the price originally agreed upon had been very moderate, they alledged that it was far above the merit of the artiſt, and forced him to accept of the paultry ſum of 200 livres; which, to add to the indignity, they paid him in copper money. To carry home this unworthy load to his indigent wife and children, poor Corregio had to travel ſix or eight miles from Parma. The weight of his burden, the heat of the weather, and his chagrin at this villainous treatment, immediately threw him into a pleuriſy, which in three days put an end to his life and his misfortunes.</p>
            <p>For the preſervation of this magnificent work the world is indebted to Titian. As he paſſed through Parma, in the <hi>ſuite</hi> of Charles V. he run inſtantly to ſee the <hi>chef d'oeavre</hi> of Corregio. While he was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively viewing it, one of the principal canons of the church told him that ſuch a groteſque performance did not merit his notice, and that they intended ſoon to have the whole defaced.
<q>"Have a care of what you do," replied the other, "if I were not Titian, I would certainly wiſh to be Corregio."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Corregio's exclamation upon viewing a picture by Raphael is well known. Having long been accuſtomed to hear the moſt unbounded ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0613800301:149"/>
beſtowed on the works of that divine painter, he by degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs deſirous than afraid of ſeeing any of them. One, however, he at laſt had occaſion to ſee. He examined it attentively for ſome minutes in profound ſilence; and then with an air of ſatisfaction exclaimed, "I am ſtill a painter." Julio Romano, on ſeeing ſome of Corregio's pictures at Parma, declared they were ſuperior to any thing in painting he had yet beheld. One of theſe no doubt would be the famous Virgin and Child, with Mary Magdalene and St. Jerom: but whether our readers are to depend upon his opinion, or upon that of Lady Millar, who in her Letters from Italy, gives a very unfavourable account of it, we ſhall not preſume to determine. This lady, however, ſpeaks in a very different ſtyle of the no leſs famous <hi>Notte</hi> or Night of Corregio, of which ſhe ſaw only a copy in the Duke's palace at Modena, the original having been ſold for a great ſum of money to the king of Poland.
<q rend="inline">"It ſurpriſes me very much, ſays ſhe, "to ſee how different the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are in this picture from that which I already have deſcribed to you. The ſubject is a Nativity; and the extraordinary beauty of this picture proceeds from the <hi>clair obſcure:</hi> there are two different lights introduced, by means of which the perſonages are viſible; namely, the light proceeding from the body of the child, and the moon-light. Theſe two are preſerved diſtinct, and produce a moſt wonderful effect. The child's body is ſo luminous, that the ſuperficies is nearly tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and the rays of light emitted by it are verified in the effect they produce upon the ſurrounding objects. They are not rays diſtinct and ſeparate, like thoſe round the face of a ſun that indicates an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance-office; nor linear, like thoſe proceeding from the man in the almanack; but of a dazzling brightneſs: by their light you ſee clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the face, neck, and hands, of the Virgin (the reſt of the perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſtrong ſhadow), the faces of the <hi>paſtori</hi> who croud round the child, and particularly one woman, who holds her hand before her face, leſt her eyes ſhould be ſo dazzled as to prevent her from behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infant. This is a beautiful natural action, and is moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly introduced. The ſtraw on which the child is laid appears gilt, from the light of his body ſhining on it. The moon lights up the back-ground of the picture, which repreſents a landſcape. Every object is diſtinct, as in a bright moon-light night; and there cannot be two lights in nature more different than thoſe which appear in the ſame picture. The virgin and the child are of the moſt perfect beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. There is a great variety of character in the different perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet that uniformity common to all herdſmen and peaſants. In ſhort, this copy is ſo admirable, that I was quite ſorry to be obliged to loſe ſight of it ſo ſoon; but I never ſhall forget it. The Duke of

Modena, for whom Corregio did the original picture, gave him only 600 livres of France for it; a great ſum in thoſe days: but at preſent, what ought it to coſt?"</q>

            <head>ALLEIN (RICHARD),</head>
            <p>THE ſon of a clergyman of the ſame name, rector of Ditchet, Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, for fifty years: his ſon Richard was born at that place in 1611; the firſt part of his education under his father, fitted him for the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in 1627. That year he entered a commoner of St. Alban's Hall, in Oxford, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts. Thence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to New Inn, where he took his maſter's degree, and entering into holy orders, became an aſſiſtant to his father. The old gentleman being inclined to puritaniſm, the ſon fell into the ſame opinions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of great zeal and learning, he was ſoon conſidered as a man fit to be followed. In March, 1641, he ſucceeded to the living of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, in Dorſetſhire, the duty of which he performed with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and fidelity; and being a zealous covenanter, had ſome diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances with the king's forces in thoſe parts. He was, however, a great enemy to that enthuſiaſtic ſpirit which prevailed in this country, on the ruin of the epiſcopal church; this appears by his ſubſcribing a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, intitled,
<q rend="inline">"The Teſtimony of the Miniſtry of Somerſetſhire to the Truth of Jeſus Chriſt, and to the ſolemn League and Covenant,"</q>
printed in 1648. His induſtry and affection to the cauſe, procured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his father to be conſtituted aſſiſtants to the commiſſioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by parliament, for ejecting ſcandalous miniſters. This was in 1654; and Mr. Wood tells us they acted with ſeverity enough. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, on the Reſtoration Mr. Allein ſhewed a diſpoſition to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the government, but could not come up to the terms of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, which occaſioned his being ejected from his living, after he had held it upwards of twenty years. After this, he continued to exerciſe his function privately, preaching ſometimes in his own houſe, at others in the houſes of gentlemen in the neighbourhood. He was once appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended at the ſeat of Mr. Moore, who had been a member of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and who had invited him thither to preach to his family and ſome of his neighbours. Mr. Moore paid the fine, which was five pounds, for him. He ſtill went on in the way of his profeſſion, notwithſtanding he was often ſummoned to the quarter ſeſſions, and ſeverely reprimanded as the keeper of a conventicle. He, however, eſcaped impriſonment, as his great learning, piety, and exemplary life, had gained him ſo high a reputation, that it would have been very unpopular to have ſent him to gaol. After the five miles act paſſed, he was obliged to leave Batcomb, and retire to Frome Selwood, where he continued in the conſtant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0613800301:151"/>
of his miniſtry, notwithſtanding the dangers he was expoſed to. He died the 22d of December, 1681, being upwards of ſixty-four years of age. He was diſtinguiſhed for his plain, practical manner of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for the delight he took in the paſtoral office. His writings, which were moſtly ſmall tracts on religious ſubjects were much eſteemed and often printed. Although a non-conformiſt, he was not tinctured either with ſpleen to the church, or diſloyalty to his prince; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he lived in a fair correſpondence with the clergy of his neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the gentry paid him great reſpect, although of oppoſite ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

            <p>WAS the ſon of Mr. Tobias Allein, and born at the Devizes, in Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, 1623. He diſcovered an extraordinary tincture of religion, even in his childhood; at eleven years of age he was much addicted to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer; and on the death of his brother Edward, who was a worthy miniſter of the goſpel, he intreated his father that he might be educated for that profeſſion. In four years he acquired a competent knowledge of Greek and Latin, and was declared by his maſter fit for the univerſity. He was, however, kept ſome time longer at home, where he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in logic, and at ſixteen was ſent to Lincoln College, Oxford. In 1651 he was removed to Corpus Chriſti College, a Wiltſhire ſcholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip being there vacant. While at college he was remarkably aſſiduous in his ſtudies, grave in his temper, but chearfully ready to aſſiſt others. He might in a ſhort time have obtained a fellowſhip, which he declined for the ſake of the office of chaplain, being pleaſed with the opportunity this gave him of exerting his gift in prayer. In July, 1653, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted bachelor of arts, and became a tutor. In this arduous employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he behaved himſelf with equal ſkill and diligence; ſeveral of his pupils became very eminent non-conforming miniſters, and not a few at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to good preferment in the eſtabliſhed church. In 1655, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came aſſiſtant in the miniſtry to Mr. G. Newton, of Taunton, in Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, where he married the ſame year. His income was ſmall, but that was aſſiſted by the profits of a boarding-ſchool, which Mrs. Allein kept. During ſeven years that he lived in this manner, he diſcharged his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral duty with incredible diligence; for beſides preaching and catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the church, he ſpent ſeveral afternoons in a week in viſiting the people of the town, and exhorting them to a religious life. Theſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations were at firſt far from being welcome to many families; but his meekneſs, moderation, and unaffected piety, made him by degrees the delight of his pariſhioners. He was deprived in 1662, for noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. He preached, however, privately. His zeal and induſtry in

The five miles act tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, he retired from Taunton to Wellington, where he continued but a ſhort time, Mr. Mallack, a merchant, inviting him to lodge at a houſe of his ſome diſtance from Taunton. In the ſummer of 1665, he was adviſed to drink the waters near the Devizes, for his health. But before he left Mr. Mallack's houſe, viz. on the 10th of July in that year, ſome friends came to take their leaves of him; they were ſurpriſed praying together, and for this were ſentenced to ſixty days impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which himſelf, ſeven miniſters, and forty private perſons, ſuffered in the county gaol. This hindered his going to the waters; and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe returning, he loſt another ſummer. At length, in 1667, he went, but was far from receiving the benefit he expected. After ſome time he went to Dorcheſter, where he grew better; but applying himſelf again to preaching, catechiſing, and other duties, his diſtemper returned with ſuch violence, that he loſt the uſe of his limbs. His death was then daily expected; but by degrees he grew ſomewhat better, and at length went to Bath, where his health altered ſo much, that his friends were in hopes he would have held out ſeveral years; but growing ſuddenly worſe again, he finiſhed his life there, in the month of November, 1668, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat above 35 years old. He was a man of great learning, and greater charity; zealous in his own way of worſhipping God, but not in the leaſt bitter towards any Chriſtians who worſhipped in another manner. He preſerved a great reſpect for the church, notwithſtanding all his ſufferings; and was eminently loyal to his prince, notwithſtanding the ſeverities of the times. His writings breathe a true ſpirit of piety, for which they have been always and deſervedly eſteemed. Anthony Wood has treated his memory very rudely, and betrayed that ſpleen he

            <head>ALLEYN (EDWARD),</head>
            <p>A CELEBRATED comedian in the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. and the founder of a college at Dulwich, in the county of Surrey, which flouriſhes to this day. He was of reſpectable parents, who lived in good faſhion and credit; his father, who, it appears, was of the houſhold to queen Elizabeth, is ſaid to have poſſeſſed an eſtate in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. Our Mr. Alleyn was born in the pariſh of St. Botolph, Biſhopſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, London, September 1, 1566, as we learn from a memorandum in his own hand writing. Dr. Fuller expreſsly ſays, near Devonſhire Houſe, the ſpot where Devonſhire Square now ſtands, where, in his time, was the ſign of the Pye. The ſame author ſays he commenced ſtage player very young, which is not improbable, notwithſtanding his father's eaſy circumſtances, as he might be averſe to any more ſerious courſe of life. He is ſaid to have applied to the ſtudy of literature; but, by what he has left of his writing, it does not appear he ever engaged himſelf deeply in ſcholaſtic ſtudy. From various teſtimonies which have been given of him, it appears he was a man of excellent natural parts. He poſſeſſed a flexible genius, great corporal agility, a lively temper, faithful memory,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0613800301:155"/>
and fluent elocution, and was in perſon, as appears by a picture preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Dulwich, of a ſtately mien and appearance: all this might induce a young man to engage himſelf in that gay and popular profeſſion. And there are alſo ſome other authorities which affirm he applied early to that vocation. It appears from ſome of the papers of the lord keeper Pickering, ſtill in being, that Alleyn acted in ſeveral of the tragedies of Chriſtopher Marlow, the poet, and was arrived at great excellence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Now as Marlow died in 1592, he muſt have been on the ſtage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time. He had then ſo captivated the town, and monopolized the favour of the public, by his ready command of voice, countenance, and geſture, and ſo judiciouſly adapted them to the characters he played, that he could animate and improve the moſt lifeleſs compoſitions, as wholly to engage his audience; ſo that in the perfection of the player they forgot the defects of the poet. Haywood, in his prologue to Marlow's Jew of Malta, calls him, Proteus for ſhapes, and Roſcius for a tongue. His character we have in a little tract written by Mr. Naſh, a celebrated ſatiriſt of thoſe times. Thus we ſee Mr. Alleyn was early famous upon the ſtage; he uſually played in the beſt dramatic pieces, and the moſt capital parts in them. He was certainly one of the original actors in the plays of our immortal Shakeſpeare, as alſo in ſome of Ben Jonſon's; but what characters he performed is difficult now to aſcertain, as the editors of thoſe times did not diſtinguiſh the character each actor played. We find his celebrity as an actor mentioned not only in proſe but in verſe. Many writers for and concerning the ſtage have beſtowed ſome fine general characters on him; and Sir Richard Baker ſays, he was as famous for his honeſty as his acting. But any particulars of his own life, except what may be gleaned from detached notes and minutes he has left of his own affairs, we have none. It is ſtrange, and rather an inſtance of ingratitude in his cotemporaries, that no one ſhould have collected ſufficient materials to have compiled ſome monument to his memory. However, by help of his papers ſtill extant, and by other antiquities of his college, ſome part of the obſcurity with which his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been hidden, has been done away: and his biographers have been enabled to diſcharge him of ſome miſrepreſentations with which he has been unjuſtly accuſed, and to ſhew him in a fairer and ſtronger light than has been hitherto done.</p>
            <p>How he accumulated a fortune ſufficient to lay the foundation, and endow ſuch a large and commodious edifice, was naturally one of the firſt objects of inquiry.

it. He was not only an actor, but manager and owner of a theatre, and had a company of comedians of his own, by whom he is ſaid to have amaſſed a good fortune. This was the Fortune playhouſe, near Whitecroſs-ſtreet, Moor Fields. He was alſo keeper of the king's wild beaſts, and maſter of the bear garden, ſituated at Bankſide, Southwark; both which places were much reſorted to, and muſt yield him a great profit, it is ſaid not leſs than 500l. per annum. A little before his death he ſold his ſhare and patent. By marriages alſo, for he was twice, if not thrice, married, and into good families, he gained ſomething hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Thus his riches were derived from various ſources.</p>
            <p>The motives which have been aſcribed to Mr. Alleyn for founding his college, and which have been readily believed by many who ſhould have had ſenſe enough to reject them, are too ridiculous to need repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the ſtory of the devil appearing in a dance, and frightening Mr. Alleyn ſo much as to induce him to quit his profeſſion and build this college as an atonement, is ſufficiently refuted by an entry in his own diary, by which it appears that he continued his connection with the ſtage ſome time after he had built his college. To aſcribe ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to an action, which ſeems to have ariſen only from a due ſenſe of piety and benevolence, is highly reprehenſible. A peruſal of Mr. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn's private papers, ſhew him to be a man habituated to devotion, for at the end of his quarterly account, he concludes with a pious ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, acknowledging all he was poſſeſſed of to be from God; indeed the ſtage ſeems rather to have inſpired him with a principle of goodneſs, from the leſſons of virtue he had there imbibed. When Mr. Alleyn had reſolved on his foundation, he did not like others poſtpone it until his death, but immediately ſet about the execution of it while in health and ſtrength, and before he was forty-eight years of age. He began, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to build his college at Dulwich in Surrey, about five miles from London, after a deſign of Mr. Inigo Jones, who was a witneſs to the deed of ſettlement; and it appears it was in good forwardneſs in 1614. He deſigned it for the reſidence of ſix poor men, ſix poor women, and twelve poor children, between the age of four and ſix, to be there kept, taught, and maintained, a ſchoolmaſter to be provided for them, who was to have his diet, lodging, and a ſtipend; the children to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there until they are fourteen or ſixteen years of age. The edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice conſiſts of the college and chapel, which, with the fitting up of the gardens, coſt him betwixt 8 and 10,000l. It was finiſhed in 1617, as appears by a diary which he kept of all his college accounts, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and occurrences, and which afford his ſucceſſors an opportunity of ſeeing how this noble foundation was begun and carried on. After he had built the college, he found ſome difficulty to obtain a charter to

ſettle his lands in mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tmain, as he propoſed to endow it with 800l. per annum, for the ſupport of the above objects of charity, and of a maſter, warden, and four fellows, three of which were to be eccleſiaſtics, and the other a ſkilful organiſt. This obſtruction aroſe from the lord chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor Bacon; but at length he was allowed to ſettle his lands his own way, and obtained a patent in 1619, by virtue whereof, Mr. Alleyn, on the 1ſt of June that year, in the chapel of the college, called the Chapel of God's Gift, did execute a proper deed of ſettlement, in preſence of many perſons of diſtinction. His diary he kept for five years longer, we find no book of accounts of his kept after his wife lived with him until 1623, when ſhe died, and in about a year or two after he married his laſt wife, who ſurvived him. He died the 21ſt of November, 1626, in the 61ſt year of his age, and was buried in the chapel of his college, and has a tomb-ſtone over his grave, with an inſcription.</p>
            <p>By his will, dated November 13, 1626, he bequeathed his wife 1500l. chargeable on an inn in Southwark, and ſome tenements in St. Saviour's pariſh, and all his jewels. He alſo gave his ſeal ring with his arms, to be worn by the maſter and his ſucceſſors to the college, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a common ſeal to be made for it. He alſo wills, that his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſhould build ten alms-houſes in the pariſh of St. Botolph, Biſhopſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and the like number in the pariſh of St. Saviour, Southwark, for the poor of theſe reſpective pariſhes, to be likewiſe members of the ſaid college.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much of the founder, we muſt now enter further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the account of his college. By the deed he aſſigned ſeveral parcels of land, to the amount of 800l. per annum, for the maintenance of a maſter, a warden, (both which muſt be unmarried, and always of the name of Alleyn or Allen) and four fellows, in theſe the government of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is inveſted; of ſix poor brethren and ſix poor ſiſters, and twelve poor children. In the deed is recited of what degree the fellows, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſiſters, and of what condition the ſcholars are to be, the form of election and admittance, the oaths to be reſpectively taken, and the duties of each office. The maſter or fellows are not to be abſent but by leave of all. The government is conducted with great decorum. The perſons in the college aſſemble at prayers twice a day, in the chapel, by one of the clergymen belonging to the foundation. When the maſter dies the warden ſucceeds. The old men and women muſt be ſingle, and of undoubted character. The front of the building is occupied by the chapel and the maſter's apartments; in the wings the inhabitants have apartments: the right wing was rebuilt in 1739; and by the care and attention of the preſent members of the college, money is now accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to rebuild the left wing, a part of which is at preſent occupied by

            <p>In the letters patent granted by James I. that monarch ſtyles Mr. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn, "Our truſtie and well beloved Edward Alleyn, Eſq. of Dulwich, in our county of Surrey, chief maſter, ruler and overſeer of all and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular our games of bears and bulls, and maſtiff dogs and maſtiff bitches."

But lord chancellor King, on its being heard before him, declared that Mr. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn could not by his order or ſtatute of 1626, add any perſons to the corporation, or make any new members, he having, in 1619, conveyed all his effects to the ſole and only uſe of the maſter, warden, &amp;c. and their ſucceſſors for ever.</p>

            <p>PROVOST of Eton College, in the reign of king Charles I. was ſon of Mr. Richard Alleſtry, of an ancient family in Derbyſhire, and born in March, 1619, at Uppington, in Shropſhire. He was educated firſt at a country free-ſchool in the neighbourhood, and afterwards at one of greater note at Coventry, where Philemon Holland the tranſlato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Six months after his ſettlement in the univerſity, Dr. Fell, dean of Chriſt Church, obſerving the parts and induſtry of young Alleſtry, made him a ſtudent of that college; where he applied himſelf to academical learning with uncommon ſucceſs. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had taken the degree of bachelor of arts, he was choſen mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator in philoſophy; which office he continued to diſcharge, till the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0613800301:161"/>
of the kingdom interrupted the ſtudies and repoſe of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. In 1641, Mr. Alleſtry, among other Oxford ſcholars engaged in the king's ſervice, and continued therein till Sir John Biron, who was ſent with a party of horſe to countenance and ſupport the ſcholars in arms, withdrew from Oxford; upon which he returned, with many others, to his gown and ſtudies. Soon after a party of the rebels hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entered Oxford, and plundered the colleges, Mr. Alleſtry narrowly eſcaped being ſeverely handled by them. In October following he took arms again, and was preſent in the battle fought by king Charles, and the rebels under the command of the Earl of Eſſex, in Keinton Field, in Warwickſhire; after which, underſtanding that the king deſigned immediately to march to Oxford, and to take up his reſidence at the deanery of Chriſt Church, he haſtened thither to prepare for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's reception; but, in his way, was taken priſoner by a party of horſe from Broughton Houſe, which was garriſoned by the Lord Say, for the parliament. His confinement was very ſhort, the garriſon ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf to the king's forces, who ſummoned it in their march. And now Mr. Alleſtry ſettled himſelf again to his ſtudies, and in the next ſpring took his degree of maſter of arts; and the ſame year his life was greatly endangered by a peſtilential diſtemper, which raged in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Oxford. Soon after his recovery, he entered a third time into his majeſty's ſervice, in a regiment formed out of the Oxford <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cholars. In this ſervice he continued till the end of the war, and then went into holy orders, at a time when he had no proſpect of worldly advantage. He was tutor to ſeveral young gentlemen and ſtudents, and diſcharged the office of cenſor of the college. He bore a part in that ſignal teſt of loyalty, which the univerſity of Oxford gave, in their decree and judgment againſt the Solemn League and Covenant; for which, in July, 1648, he was proſcribed and expelled the univerſity by the parliament viſiters. Being thus driven from Oxford, he retired into Shropſhire, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained as chaplain to the honourable Francis Newport, and upon the death of his father Lord Newport, he was ſent over into France to take care of that nobleman's effects. Having diſpatched this affair with good ſucceſs, he came back to his employment, and continued in it till king Charles II. marched into England with his Scotch army, and until his wonderful eſcape at Worceſter; at which time the managers of the king's affairs wanting an intelligent and faithful perſon to ſend over to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, Mr. Alleſtry was deſired to undertake the journey; which he did, and having attended the king at Rouen, and received his diſpatches, he returned to England. Here he found his friends Mr. Dolben and Mr. Fell, who had likewiſe been baniſhed the univerſity, reſiding privately,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0613800301:162"/>
and performing the offices of the church of England for the loyaliſts; upon which he joined them, and continued with them, till Sir Anthony Cope, a loyal gentleman of conſiderable quality and fortune, in Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, prevailed upon him to live in his family; where he continued ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years, with liberty of going or ſtaying as occaſion required; and by this means he was enabled, without being taken notice of, to convey meſſages to the king from his friends. After ſeveral difficult journies ſucceſsfully performed, he was ſent over in the winter before his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's reſtoration, into Flanders; from whence returning with letters, he was ſeized, upon his landing at Dover, by a party of ſoldiers; but had the addreſs to ſecure his letters, by conveying them to a faithful hand. Being guarded up to London, he was examined by a committee of the council of ſafety, and ſent priſoner to Lambeth Houſe, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a dangerous ſickneſs. After ſix or eight weeks confinement, he was ſet at liberty, and returned into Oxfordſhire; from whence, after a ſhort ſtay, he went into Shropſhire to viſit his relations. Soon after the reſtoration, Mr. Alleſtry was made a canon of Chriſt Church, and readily concurred in repairing the injuries and decays that church and college had ſuffered during the uſurpation. At the ſame time he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took one of the lectureſhips of the city of Oxford, with a view to inſtil principles of loyalty into the minds of the citizens; yet he never received any part of the profits, but conſtantly diſtributed it among the poor. He took the degree of doctor of divinity, on the 3d of October, 1660, and was appointed one of the king's chaplains in ordinary; and ſoon after, upon a vacancy of the divinity chair, he was choſen regis profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. In 1665, the king conferred upon Dr. Alleſtry the provoſtſhip of Eton college, which he held to his death. In 1679, finding his health, and particularly his ſight, much impaired, he reſigned the profeſſorſhip of divinity, and had the ſatisfaction to be ſucceeded therein by Dr. Jane, of whoſe abilities he had perfect knowledge. And now the decay of his conſtitution terminating in a dropſy, he removed to London, to be nearer the advice of phyſicians; but medicines proving ineffectual, he died in January, 1680, and was buried in Eton chapel, under a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of white marble. We ſhall give his character from the account of his life contained in the preface to his ſermons. He was a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able benefactor to Eton college, and raiſed the credit and reputation of the ſchool, which he found in a very low condition. There are extant forty ſermons of Dr. Alleſtry's, the greateſt part of which were preached before the king, and upon ſolemn occaſions. It is much to be regretted, that he could not be prevailed upon to publiſh his lectures, which, when firſt delivered, were heard with the greateſt ſatisfaction and applauſe.

            <p>A VERY learned and eminent divine of the church of England, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a native of France, and well known in the republic of letters for his many and excellent writings. He was born at Alençon, in the year 1641; and having received an excellent education, which highly improved his natural parts, he became miniſter to a reformed church at Rouen; where he publiſhed many learned and curious pieces, by which he acquired a great reputation. He was called from Rouen to Charen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which was the principal reformed church in France, the village in which it ſtood lying a little more than a league from Paris; we muſt therefore conſider this removal as the higheſt teſtimony of reſpect his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0613800301:164"/>
brethren could ſhew him. Being now in the zenith of his preferment, and in a condition to do good ſervice to the church, he applied himſelf to the taſk with the utmoſt zeal, and preached many excellent ſermons in defence of the faith, againſt the archbiſhop of Meaux; who was then labouring to overturn the reformed religion, by ſeeming conceſſions to its profeſſors. Some of his ſermons were afterwards printed in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and are deſervedly commended by Bayle.</p>
            <p>Upon the revocation of the edict of Nantz, Mr. Alfix found himſelf obliged to quit France, and prepared an affecting farewel diſcourſe to his congregation, which he had not an opportunity to deliver; it was afterwards printed, and deſervedly celebrated. This edict was revoked in 1685, and the reformed baniſhed France; on which Mr. Allix, by advice of his friends, repaired to England. Here, on account of his extenſive learning and great knowledge of eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, he met a very favourable reception. He applied himſelf cloſely to learn the Engliſh language; and ſoon attained to a ſurpriſing perfection, as appeared by a book he publiſhed in defence of the Chriſtian religion, which he dedicated to King James, in very reſpectful terms; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging at the ſame time, not only his perſonal obligations to that prince, but alſo his kindneſs to the diſtreſſed refugees in general. He was ſoon complimented with the degree of doctor in divinity, and in 1690, had the treaſurerſhip of the church of Saliſbury beſtowed on him. It was propoſed he ſhould have publiſhed an authentic hiſtory of the councils; but this miſcarried for want of encouragement. He wrote however ſeveral treatiſes on eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, equally learned and entertaining, which were very uſeful to the proteſtant cauſe, and attacked warmly both by the Romiſh prieſts and princes. Theſe pieces raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. Allix's credit as high in this country as it was in France. In 1699, he wrote a very learned book in defence of the Trinity, which had conſiderable effect, and has always been looked upon as a piece of great value, with reſpect to Hebrew literature. He wrote likewiſe ſeveral other learned and ingenious treatiſes, on curious and important ſubjects. He continued, for upwards of thirty years, an active mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the republic of letters, and an able and affectionate defender of the eſtabliſhed church. Some of his pieces have been ſeverely cenſured, particularly by Mr. Bayle, and his orthodoxy has by many been called in queſtion.

He poſſeſſed great learning, a wonderful livelineſs of temper; and expreſſed himſelf on all ſubjects with ſo much ſprightlineſs, that it was impoſſible to flag in his company. He was conſulted by the greateſt men of the age, and acknowledged as a man of the firſt abilities by the moſt eſteemed critics. His attention was given to the whole circle of ſciences, which fall under the cognizance of a ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or divine. All theſe he had well digeſted, and his ſermons evince him to be an admirable orator, and a profound ſcholar.

            <p>THERE have been many Mahomedan princes of this name, but the three who have moſt diſtinguiſhed themſelves are the following. The firſt was king of Cordova, and died in 1002, after having taken Barcelona, and made the Chriſtians in ſeveral rencounters feel the ſtrength of his arms. The ſecond, Joſeph Almanzor, was king of Morocco, and was defeated by the Spaniards in 1158.

               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0613800301:167"/>From hence they ſailed to Mombaſſa, and immediately attacked that place. A ſhot from the Portugueze ſet fire to the powder magazine, which ſo terrified the inhabitants that they abandoned the fort. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſed the port to be ſounded, and finding water ſufficient, he entered the harbour, and then ſent a meſſage to require the king to ſubmit himſelf to the king of Portugal; but the meſſenger was refuſed admittance. Almeida endeavoured to ſeize ſome of the natives, and took priſoner a domeſtic of the king, from whom he had intelligence that the king had received into his pay 4000 auxiliaries, and expected more. On this intelligence he reſolved to beſiege the place; and ſet fire to a part of the city. The natives attacked the Portugueze, although at the ſame time employed in extinguiſhing the flames; which however proved their beſt friends, and obliged the enemy to retire. Next day, when the flames abated, the Portugueze again entered the city, and were much annoyed by the narrowneſs of the ſtreets, and the darts of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my flung from the houſes. However, Almeida ſoon having ſecured the palace, the Portugueze joined their ſtrength, and obliged the natives to ſeek their ſafety by flight, and make off to a wood, to which the king had retreated. The city was plundered, but moſt of the valuable effects had been carried away. The Portugueze writers tell us, they killed in this action 1500, and took 2000 priſoners, with the loſs only of five men killed, and ſeveral wounded.</p>
            <p>From hence he ſailed with his fleet for Melinda, but by tempeſtuous weather, was driven three leagues beyond; from thence they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the iſland of Anchidive, where he built a fort, and ſent ſome of his ſhips out to cruize. Here he received deputies from the king of Onor, to treat of peace, and alſo the ſubmiſſion of a pyratical chief, of the name of Timoia. However a circumſtance ſoon happened to ſhew the former was not ſincere; and the viceroy ſailed to Onor, and burned ſome ſhips in the harbour. A day or two after, he ſent his ſon to burn the other ſhips: a ſmart action enſued, and the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueze were obliged to retreat. Almeida ſailed next day to Cananor, where he found it neceſſary to build a ſtrong fort to protect his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men againſt the Arabians, who, jealous of the Portugueze, did them every injury in their power.</p>
            <p>While Almeida remained here, he had the happineſs to receive an embaſſy from the king of Narſinga, offering friendſhip, and his daughter as a wife for John the ſon of Emanuel. He had alſo a viſit from the king of Cananor, from whom he obtained liberty to build his fort. From this place he diſpatched his ſon on an expedition to Caulan.</p>

the port of Panama (about 50 miles off) eſcorted by a fleet of ſhips of war of Calicut, he reſolved to attack them in the harbour. He ſailed for that purpoſe with twelve ſhips of war. On his paſſage he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the ſhips were not yet afloat, but lay in the docks, under cover of a rampart, and a ſtrong garriſon of 4000 men. Almeida had only 700, and with theſe he reſolved to attack the enemy. He attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to land and burn the ſhips; and after a violent conflict ſucceeded. A ſtrong proof of the ſuperiority of the Portugueze at this time in war, for the enemy ſought with deſperate courage, there being many among them who had taken an oath to conquer or die. Theſe devotees had all their heads ſhaven, and were deſtroyed to a man. Almeida having made good his landing, advanced to the city, and ſet it on fire, being fearful of the conſequences of permitting his men to plunder it. The men murmured at being deprived of ſuch a rich booty; but this the viceroy diſregarded, and to keep them employed, diſpatched his ſon with a ſquadron to cruize againſt the Arabians, who in an engagement with the enemy's fleet loſt his life. Almeida, who had often ſhewn that he poſſeſſed great fortitude, now gave a ſtriking proof of it; and thoſe who lamented the death of young Almeida with too much ſorrow, he told them, "That he had never wiſhed a long, but a glorious life for his ſon; and for his part, he thanked God for honouring him with ſo glorious a death."</p>
            <p>While he commanded in India, Albuquerque was making conqueſts for his country to the northward; but as he did not act under Almeida's inſtructions, the latter was offended, and even wrote to ſome of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Chiefs, that Albuquerque acted without his orders. However, the exploits of the latter drew the attention of the court of Portugal, and be was appointed to ſuperſede Almeida in his viceroyſhip. When the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the viceroy's return was brought, he was employed in fitting out a fleet to revenge the death of his ſon. This furniſhed him with an excuſe for not delivering up his government; and he ſailed on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to Dabul, landed there, defeated the enemy, and made a moſt dreadful ſlaughter, not ſparing even the infants. The next day the city was given up to be plundered, and afterwards burned. This was the fate of many other places on theſe coaſts. He then cruized along the coaſt until he fell in with the enemy's fleet, engaged and totally defeated it, killing 4000 men. The ſultan had taken great pains in fitting out this fleet, and it is ſuppoſed had engaged Europeans of ſeveral nation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Unfortunately ſtopping at a place not far from the Cape of Good Hope, a ſlight quarrel aroſe between the Portugueze and natives, and in an action with them, Almeida received a wound in his throat with a javelin, and died immediately. Thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired this brave, honeſt, and renowned commander by his own impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Before he went to India he had diſtinguiſhed himſelf greatly in the wars of Granada. In India his exploits have been ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he fell, the reſt of the Portugueze fled. Two officers who ſaw him fall endeavoured to perſuade their countrymen to recover his body; but finding intreaties ineffectual, they ruſhed upon the enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were ſoon overpowered by numbers, and fell.</p>

Soon after he was ſent on a cruize againſt the Maldive iſlands, to intercept all Arabian ſhips. The ſtrength of the currents in thoſe ſeas, drove him as far ſouth as Cape Comorin, and the iſland of Ceylon, and he put into a port in the latter. The king hearing of his arrival, and having before heard of the fame of the Portugueze in thoſe parts, treated him with great reſpect, and entered into a treaty, by which he agreed to pay a yearly tribute to the king of Portugal, on condition of receiving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and defence.

It conſiſted of five large ſhips, and ſix galleys, to which the king of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya joined thirty ſloops of war. When they appeared off Chaul, the Portugueze concluded they were the ſhips of Albuquerque, and made no preparation to engage; the Egyptian admiral entered the river, but his allies remained out at ſea.</p>
            <p>The next day Lawrence Almeida weighed anchor and attacked the admiral's ſhip. In this action Almeida was wounded. His officers, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were becalmed, and could not come to cloſe quarters with the enemy, adviſed him to return. This he declined, and ſoon receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another deſperate wound in the face with a dart. The action con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at a diſtance, Almeida not being able to get near his enemy. Other captains were more fortunate, they boarded and took two ſhips. The next day, the fleet from ſea came in and joined the enemy. The Portugueze held a council, and were almoſt unanimouſly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they ought to put to ſea in the night; this they endeavoured to effect; but the enemy purſued and came up with the admiral's ſhip, which was in the rear, and ſurrounded her. An unfortunate ſhot ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it impoſſible to ſteer her, ſhe ran aground. The Portugueze captains had a ſtrong deſire to aſſiſt their admiral, but the violence of the tide prevented them.

When of age for the univerſity, Mr. Biddell ſent the three brothers to Oxford,

where the ſmall-pox unhappily prevailing, two of them died of it. We know not if this ſurviving brother took any degrees or not, but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he did, ſince he entered into holy orders, and in the year 1618 had the rectory of Wooley in Huntingdonſhire. Here he performed his duty with great chearfulneſs and alacrity; and notwithſtanding he was twice invited back to his native country, by ſome who would have ventured their utmoſt to have placed him on the throne of Ruſſia; yet he preferred remaining with his flock, and ſerving God in the humble ſtation of a pariſh prieſt. Yet in 1643, he underwent the ſevereſt trials from the rage of the fanatics, who, not ſatisfied with depriving him of his living, inſulted him in a moſt barbarous manner; and having ſent a file of muſketeers to pull him out of the pulpit, as he was preaching on Sunday, they turned his wife and children out of doors, and threw his goods into the ſtreet.

One day having procured a few eggs, and picked up ſome rotten wood and dried ſticks, with which he made a fire in the church porch to boil them, his implacable adverſaries came and kicked out his fire, and deſtroyed his eggs. After this, as he ſtill poſſeſſed a little property, he made a ſmall purchaſe in that neighbourhood, built a houſe, and lived there for ſome years. He was enabled to do this in ſome degree by the preſbyterian miniſter who ſucceeded him, who honeſtly paid him a fifth part of the income of the living, (being the allowance made by parliament to ejected miniſters,) treated him with great humanity, and did him all the ſervices in his power.

               </gap>nons and treaſurers of the church of St. John of Beverly. Some hiſtorians poſitively affirm, that he flouriſhed under king Stephen, and continued his annals to the year 1136. But others, with more appearance of truth, tell us that he flouriſhed under Henry I. and died in the year 1126, in which year they aſſert that he ended his annals. His hiſtory however contradicts this, as it is continued to the twenty-ninth of Henry I. conſequently he died in 1128, or 9. His preface to his work informs us, that he was a man devoted to his ſtudies, and rather in narrow circumſtances. He intended at firſt no more than an abridgement of the hiſtory of the ancient Britons; but when he had gone thus far, a deſire of purſuing the thread of his ſtory, led him to add the Saxon, and then the Norman hiſtory, down to his own time. This was the only piece he wrote, notwithſtanding the aſſertions of ſeveral great men. This abridgement of our hiſtory from Brutus to Henry I. is one of the moſt valuable pieces that has eſcaped the rage of time. It is written in a conciſe, elegant Latin ſtyle, with great perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, and a more than ordinary attention to dates and authorities. He may with great propriety be called the Engliſh Florus; his plan being nearly the ſame, and equally happy in the execution. It ſeems won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful that Leland does not give him a place among our Engliſh writers, as it is clear he had ſeen our author's hiſtory. The reaſon ſeems to have been, that Leland conſidered him only as the author of an abridgement of Jeffery of Monmouth's hiſtory. In this he was miſtaken, for our author is by no means a mere tranſcriber of the Britiſh hiſtory, but went much further than the author he is ſaid to have copied. Beſides, it is doubtful whether he ever ſaw Jeffery of Monmouth's hiſtory; if he had, it is difficult to aſſign a reaſon why he did not mention the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as he is very exact in other places. If he had really been Jeffery of Monmouth's tranſlator, why ſhould he have concealed it?</p>
            <p>The MSS. of his work are very ſcarce, and very few who mention it, have ſeen it. Mr. Joſſelin, in his catalogue of Engliſh hiſtorians, aſſures us the MS. was in the hands of Mr. Nettleton. The MS. from whence Mr. Hearne publiſhed it at Oxford, in 1716, belonged to T. Rawlinſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Mr. Hearne acknowledges it was the only one he ever ſaw. He calls it the Annals of Alured of Beverly, which, as the dates are conſtantly preſerved, it may with propriety be called. John Withamſted, a very ancient writer, ſpeaking of our author, ſays, that he wrote a chronicle of what happened from the ſettlement of Brutus, to the time of the Normans. This authority is much to the honour of our hiſtorian, for Withamſted was a critic. This work therefore, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0613800301:175"/>
the hiſtory of St. John of Beverly, are all that fall from our author's pen. The hiſtory of St. John of Beverly is in being, in the Cotton library: but it appears by the title to be a collection of records, rather than a hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hearne has added ſome notes to his edition, and a preface, wherein he endeavours to vindicate our author from the charge of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giariſm. And we may affirm, that if any epitome of Engliſh hiſtory deſerved well of the public in general, we would ſay this hiſtory of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedus is it. For in point of accuracy and elegance, he is ſuperior to Huntingdon, Hovedon, Malmſbury, and others.</p>

When Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberg was taken in 1622, Alting was in danger of his life. As he was haſtening to the houſe of the chancellor, to avoid the fury of the ſoldiers, a lieutenant-colonel ſtopped him, ſaying, <hi>this ax has already finiſhed nine men; doctor Alting ſhould ſoon make the tenth, if I knew where he was.</hi> Alting eſcaped by telling him, that he was regent of the college of wiſdom. He afterwards occupied the theological chair at Groningen until his death, which happened in 1644. He left behind him many works both in print and manuſcript, which are in no great eſteem. The ſecond, James Alting, ſon of the former, was born at Heidelberg, in 1618. He had ſome warm diſputes with the miniſter, Sam. des Marets, a theologian who referred every thing to ſcholaſtic learning, and who could not bear that theology ſhould be guided by the Holy Scriptures and the fathers. Alting died in the year 1679; and his works, which make five volumes in folio, were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at Amſterdam, in 1687. We may perceive by them, that

The Mahomedan general informed of Amauri's mean paſſion, amuſed him ſo long under pretence of collecting two millions of gold for him, that he gained time for the army of Noradin to arrive, who forced him to raiſe the ſiege.

            <head>AMAURI (DE CHARTRES),</head>
            <p>A CLERGYMAN, a native of Bonne, a village in the dioceſe of Chartres, profeſſed philoſophy with diſtinction about the middle of the thirteenth century. Adopting the metaphyſics of Ariſtotle, led him
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0613800301:181"/>
into dangerous errors. He formed to himſelf a new ſyſtem of religion, which, according to the Abbé Pluguet, he thus explained. Ariſtotle ſuppoſes that all beings are compoſed of matter, which has in itſelf neither form nor ſhape, this he calls the <hi>firſt matter.</hi> This Amauri called God, becauſe it is a neceſſary and infinite being. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in God, three perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, to whom he attributed the empire of the world, and whom he regarded as the object of religious worſhip. But as this matter was endowed with a property of continual motion, it neceſſarily followed that this world muſt ſome time have an end, and that all the beings therein muſt return to that firſt matter, which was the ſupreme of all beings—the firſt exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the only one eternal. Religion, according to Amauri's opinion, had three epocha's, which bore a ſimilitude to the reign of the three perſons in the Trinity, the reign of God had exiſted as long as the law of Moſes. The reign of the Son would not always laſt; the ceremonies and ſacrifices, which according to Amauri conſtituted the eſſence of it, would not be eternal. A time would come when the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould ceaſe, and then the religion of the Holy Ghoſt would begin, in which men would have no need of ſacraments, and would render a ſpiritual worſhip to the Supreme Being. This epocha was the reign of the Holy Ghoſt, which according to Amauri was foretold by the ſcripture, and which would ſucceed to the Chriſtian religion, as the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religon had ſucceeded to that of Moſes. The Chriſtian religion therefore was the reign of Jeſus Chriſt in the world, and every man under that law ought to look on himſelf as one of the members of Jeſus Chriſt. Amauri had many proſelytes, and his opinions were condemned by Pope Innocent III. His diſciples added other extravagances, as that the ſacraments were uſeleſs, and that no action dictated by charity could be bad. They were condemned by the council of Paris in 1209, and many of them burned. Amauri appealed to the pope, who alſo condemned his doctrines: for fear of a rigorous puniſhment he retracted his opinions, retired to <hi>St. Martin des Champs,</hi> and died there of chagrin and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.

Being deſtined at a very early age for the church, he was elected biſhop of Montauban when only fourteen. He was afterwards made one of the almoners to Lewis XI. to whom he behaved with great prudence. After the death of this prince in 1480, he entered into ſome of the intrigues of the court with a deſign to favour the Duke of Orleans, with whom he was

The Duke of Orleans was at laſt reſtored to his liberty; and this prince having negociated the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the king with the princeſs Anne of Britanny, acquired great reputation and credit at court. Of this his favourite D'Amboiſe felt the happy effects, for ſoon after the archbiſhopric of Narbonne was beſtowed on him. But as that was at too great a diſtance from the court, he changed it for that of Rouen, to which a chapter elected him in 1493. As ſoon as he had taken poſſeſſion of his new ſee, the Duke of Orleans, who was governor of Normandy, made him lieutenant-general, with the ſame power as if he had been governor in chief. This province was at that time in great diſorder: the nobleſſe oppreſſed the people, the judges were all corrupted or intimidated; the ſoldiers, who had been licentious ſince the late wars, infeſted the high ways, plundering and aſſaſſinating all travellers they met. But in leſs than a year, D'Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe by his care and prudence, eſtabliſhed public tranquillity in the province committed to his care.

By his firſt operation in that office, he conciliated the affection of the whole nation. It had been a cuſtom when a new monarch aſcended the throne, to lay an extraordinary tax on the people, to defray the expences of the coronation, but by the counſel of D'Amboiſe, this tax was not levied; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts were ſoon reduced one tenth. His virtues coinciding with his knowledge, he made the French nation happy, and endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the glory they had acquired. By his advice Lewis XII. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the conqueſt of the Milaneſe in 1499. Lewis the Moor, uncle and vaſſal of Maximilian, was then in poſſeſſion of that province.

the marriage between Lewis XII. and Joan of France, to which he greatly contributed; and after he had procured for Caeſar Borgia, ſon of pope Alexander the VI. the dutchy of Valentinois, with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able penſion. His ambition was to be pope, but he ſaid only with a view to labour at the reform of abuſes, and the correction of manners. After the death of Pius III. he might have ſucceeded in his wiſhes, if he had poſſeſſed as much cunning as the Italian cardinals. He took mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to procure the tiara, but Cardinal Julian de Rovera (afterwards Julius II.) found means to circumvent him. The Venetians had contributed greatly to his excluſion; he therefore took the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to excite Lewis XII. to make war on them. This celebrated cardinal died in 1510, in the convent of the Celeſtines at Lyons, of the gout in his ſtomach, aged 50 years. They ſay that he often repeated to the friar who attended him in his illneſs, "<hi>Brother John, why have I not during my whole life, been brother John?</hi>" This miniſter has been greatly praiſed for having laboured for the happineſs of France; but he has been much cenſured for having adviſed his maſter to ſign the treaty of Blois, in 1504, by which France ran the riſk of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered. He governed both the king and the ſtate; laborious, kind, honeſt, he poſſeſſed good ſenſe, firmneſs, and experience: but he was not a great genius, nor were his views extenſive. The deſire he had to eaſe the people in their taxes, procured him during his life, but much more after his death, the title of Father of the People. He merited this title ſtill more, by the care he took to reform the adminiſtration of juſtice. Moſt of the judges were venal, and permitted themſelves either to be corrupted or intimidated; the poor, and thoſe who had no ſupport, could never obtain juſtice, when their oppoſers were either powerful or rich. Another evil not leſs enormous troubled the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; law-ſuits were ſpun out to ſuch a length, were ſo expenſive, and accompanied by ſo much trick and chicanery, that moſt people rather choſe to abandon their right, than engage in the recovery of them by ſuits which had no proſpect of coming to an end. D'Amboiſe reſolved to remedy this abuſe. He called to his aſſiſtance many lawyers and civilians, the moſt learned and of the greateſt integrity; and charged them to form a plan, by which juſtice might be adminiſtered without partiality, the duration of law-ſuits abridged and rendered leſs ruinous; and alſo to prevent the corruption of the judges. When theſe commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners had made their report, D'Amboiſe undertook the laborious taſk of examining into the changes they had propoſed in the old laws, and the new regulations they deſigned to eſtabliſh; and after having made ſome changes, theſe new regulations were publiſhed throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. As he was governor of Normandy, he made a progreſs through that

            <p>There were ſeveral other diſtinguiſhed men of this name, as Aimery D'Amboiſe, a brother of the former, who was grand maſter of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. John of Jeruſalem. The great naval victory he obtained over the Soldan of Egypt, near Montenegro, in 1510, made his name celebrated, not only among his own order, but throughout Europe. He died about two years after. Abbé Vertot, has drawn his character as, "a wiſe prince, able in government, and happy in all his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes; who enriched his order with the ſpoils of the infidels, without appropriating any to himſelf.' 3. Francis D'Amboiſe, ſurgeon to Charles IX. of France, who died about the year 1620.

            <head>AMBROSE (ST).</head>
            <p>ONE of the moſt eminent fathers of the Chriſtian church in the fourth century, born in Gaul, while his father was <hi>Praefectus praetorio</hi> of that province. The birth of Saint Ambroſe is ſaid to have been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a remarkable preſage of his future eloquence, for we are told that a ſwarm of bees came and ſettled upon his mouth, as he lay in his cradle. He ſoon made himſelf maſter of ſeveral parts of ſecular learning, and pleaded cauſes before Probus with ſo much eloquence, that he was appointed his ſucceſſor, and ſoon after governor of the provinces of Liguria and Emilia. He ſettled at Milan, where, in the year 374, upon the death of Auxentius biſhop of that city, there being a great conteſt between the Catholics and Arians concerning the choice of a new biſhop, Ambroſe thought it his duty as governor to go to church, in order to compoſe the tumult. He accordingly addreſſed himſelf to the people, in a gentle pathetic ſpeech, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to proceed in their choice in a calm and friendly manner; while he was ſpeaking to them, the whole aſſembly cried out "Let Ambroſe be biſhop." Such a ſudden and unexpected incident ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed him exceedingly, ſo that he retired immediately, and uſed every method to divert them from their reſolution of chooſing him; but at laſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0613800301:185"/>
he was obliged to comply, and was baptized; being before only a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumen, and ordained biſhop towards the latter end of the year 374. About the year 377, the barbarous nations making an incurſion into the Roman empire, he fled to Illyricum, and afterwards to Rome. In the year 384, he was ſent to the tyrant Maximus, who had uſurped the empire, and prevailed upon him not to paſs into Italy. The heathens encouraged by theſe inteſtine commotions in the empire, attempted to reſtore their religion, and employed Aurelius Symmachus, a man of great eloquence to plead their cauſe. But Symmachus having loſt his cauſe, was expelled the city, and commanded not to approach within an hundred miles of it. The petition which he preſented to the Emperor Valentinian the younger, is ſtill extant. St. Ambroſe wrote a confutation of this petition. St. Ambroſe met with great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from the Arians, againſt whom he acted with great ſpirit and intrepidity. Juſtinia, the empreſs, and mother of Valentinian, who was an Arian, and deſirous to reſtore that religion in Milan, demanded of St. Ambroſe one of the churches there, which he refuſed, and the people taking his part, ſhe was obliged to deſiſt, and even to aſk his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with the people to pacify them.</p>
            <p>Ambroſe was ſent a ſecond time to the tyrant Maximus; for Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian found no perſon ſo proper to negociate with him. He ſpoke to him with great courage and boldneſs, but could obtain nothing; for Maximus ſoon after marched into Italy, and made himſelf maſter of the weſtern empire; ſo that Valentinian was obliged to retire with his mother Juſtinia and his ſiſter Galla, to Theſſalonica in Illyricum, in order to deſire Theodoſius's aſſiſtance, who defeated Maximus, and reſtored Valentinian to the empire.</p>
            <p>While Theodoſius continued in Italy, after the defeat of Maximus, an inſurrection happened at Theſſalonica, in which ſeveral of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates were ſtoned, and their bodies dragged along the ſtreets. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius being informed of this, raſhly commanded a certain number to be put to death promiſcuouſly; by which means the city was filled with the blood of many innocent perſons, and amongſt the reſt ſeveral ſtrangers, who had but juſt come there: no regard was paid to any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of perſons, no form of trial was obſerved, but they were cut down like corn in the harveſt, as Theodoret expreſſes it, to the number of 7000. At this time an aſſembly of biſhops was held at Milan, who all expreſſed an abhorrence of ſuch cruelty in the emperor Ambroſe wrote a letter to him, in which he repreſented the enormity of his crime, and exhorted him to make ſatisfaction, by a ſincere ſubmiſſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Some time after Theodoſius coming to Milan, went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſacrament at the great church; where Ambroſe meeting him at
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0613800301:186"/>
the door, denied him entrance, and repreſented his guilt in the moſt forcible and pathetic terms. The emperor was ſtruck with his words, and with great uneaſineſs of mind returned to his palace: but about a year after, Ambroſe being convinced of the ſincerity of his repentance, admitted him into the church. In 392, Valentinian the emperor being aſſaſſinated by the contrivance of Argobaſtes, and Eugenius uſurping the empire, Ambroſe was obliged to leave Milan, but he returned the year following, after Eugenius was defeated.</p>
            <p>He died at Milan the 4th of April, 397; being 57 years of age, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to M. Du Pin, and ſome other writers; but Dr. Cave and Olearius ſay that he was 64 years old at his death. He was buried in the great church at Milan. He wrote ſeveral works, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of which is that De Officiis. He is conciſe and ſententious in his manner of writing, and full of turns of wit; his terms are well choſen, and his expreſſions noble; he diverſifies his ſubject by an admirable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſneſs of thoughts and language: he is very ingenious in giving an eaſy and natural turn to every thing which he treats of, and is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength and pathos when there is occaſion for it. This is the character which Du Pin gives him as a writer; but Eraſmus obſerves, that he has many quaint and affected ſentences, and frequently very obſcure ones; and it is certain that his writings are intermixed with many ſtrange and peculiar opinions. Paulinus wrote his life, and dedicated it to St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin: this life is prefixed to St. Ambroſe's works, the beſt edition of which is reckoned to be that publiſhed by the Benedictine monks, in two volumes in folio, at Paris, in 1686 and 1690.</p>

            <p>A CELEBRATED general of the ancient Britons, and afterwards king, was of Roman extraction, and commonly ſuppoſed to be the ſon of one of their kings, elected by the Britons after the Romans had left the iſland. He was educated at the court of Aldroen, king of Armorica, who, at the requeſt of the Britons, ſent him with an army to aſſiſt againſt the Saxons, whom Vortigern their king had invited into Britain. Ambroſius's ſucceſs againſt the Saxons was ſo conſiderable, that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons choſe him for their king, obliging Vortigern to yield to him all the weſtern part of the kingdom, divided by the Roman highway, called Watling-ſtreet. Some time after, the Britons being diſcontented with Vortigern, and having withdrawn their allegiance from him, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy prince retired into Wales, where being beſieged by Ambroſius, and the caſtle taking fire, he periſhed in the flames, and left his rival ſole monarch of Britain.

The Monmouth hiſtorian gives this prince a very advantageous character, and tells us, he was poiſoned at Wincheſter, by one Eopa, a Saxon, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed as a phyſician, and hired for that purpoſe by Paſcentius, one of the ſons of Vortigern; but the generally received opinion is, that he was killed in a battle, anno 508, againſt the Saxons.

Mr. Ames ſoon after went to the Hague, and from thence was invited by the ſtates of Frieſland to the divinity chair in the univerſity of Franeker, which he filled with reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for many years.

            <p>BORN at Florence, of a very ancient family in 1451. He diſcovered very early a taſte for philoſophy, mathematics, and ſea-voyages. As ſoon as he was informed of Columbus's return from the diſcovery of the Weſt Indies, he burned with impatience to be partaker of his glory. He applied to Ferdinand king of Spain, who ſupplied him with four ſhips, with which he departed from Cadiz in 1497. He fell in with the coaſt of Paria, and ran along it, and alſo the coaſt of Terra Firma, as far as the gulph of Mexico, returning to Spain in about eighteen months. He did not diſpute with Columbus the glory of having diſcovered the Weſt India iſlands; but pretended that he firſt diſcovered the continent of America. For this the Spaniſh writers are very ſevere, and charge him with having falſified dates to ſupport his claim. A year after his firſt voyage, Veſputius performed a ſecond with ſix ſhips, ſtill under the auſpices of Ferdinand and Iſabella. In this voyage he proceeded to the Antilla iſlands, and from thence to the coaſt of Guiana and

He ran down the coaſt of Africa as far as Sierra Leon, and the coaſt of Angola. He then ſtood over for the coaſt of America, and fell in with Brazil, which he diſcovered entirely, ſouth as far as Patagonia, and north to the river of Plata. This illuſtrious navigator then ſailed back to Sierra Leon, and keeping along the coaſt of Guinea, returned to Portugal, arriving at Liſbon in September, 1502. King Emanuel highly ſatisfied with this ſucceſs, equipped ſix ſhips, with which our navigator made a fourth voyage. In this voyage he deſigned to ſtand along the coaſt of America to the ſouth, until he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a paſſage to the Molucca Iſlands to the weſtward.

            <p>A MAN who has been greatly diſtinguiſhed as a poet, and a poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writer of the preſent century, was ſo much talked of for a time, and ſo cloſely connected with the leaders of the grand oppoſition to Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Walpole's adminiſtration, that, although we have but few materials with regard to the circumſtances of his life, he cannot be entirely omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He was born at Marden in Kent, but in what year is uncertain. Under the protection and care of his grandfather, who was a clergyman, he received his grammatical education at merchant-taylor's ſchool, in London; and from thence was removed to St. John's college, Oxford, where his behaviour was ſuch as occaſioned his expulſion. What the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and ſpecific charges againſt him were, we are not informed; but in general, he is ſaid to have been expelled for the libertiniſm of his principles, the irregularity of his conduct, and ſome offence which he had given to the heads of the college. From his own account of the matter, in the dedication of his poems to Dr. Delaune, preſident of St. John's, and in his Terrae Filius, we may collect that he wiſhed to have it underſtood, he was ſolely perſecuted for the liberality of his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his attachment to the cauſe of the Revolution, and of the Hanover ſucceſſion; but he had probably been guilty of real miſbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.

He made it therefore his buſineſs to fatirize the learning and diſcipline of the univerſity of Oxford, and to expoſe the characters of ſeveral gentlemen who were deemed a part of its moſt reſpectable members. This he did in a poem, which he called Oculus Britanniae, and again in his Terrae Filius, a work in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0613800301:191"/>
which there is a conſiderable portion of wit, intermixed with much abuſe and ſcurrility. Soon after Mr. Amhurſt quitted Oxford, he ſeems to have ſettled in London as a writer by profeſſion. He publiſhed a volume of miſcellanies, which had principally been written at the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. The miſcellanies are upon a variety of ſubjects, both ſacred and profane. They are partly originals, and partly paraphraſes, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and tranſlations; and conſiſt of tales, epigrams, epiſtles, love verſes, elegies, and ſatires. They begin with a beautiful paraphraſe on the Moſaic account of the creation, and with a very humorous tale on the diſcovery of that uſeful utenſil a bottle-ſcrew. Mr. Amhurſt was the author likewiſe of an epiſtle to Sir John Blount, Bart. one of the South-Sea company in 1720; of the Britiſh General, a poem ſacred to the memory of his Grace John Duke of Marlborough; and of Strephon's revenge, a ſatire on the Oxford toaſts. Our poet, who had a great enmity to the exorbitant demands and domineering ſpirit of the high church clergy, and who had early at Oxford diſplayed his zeal againſt prieſtly power, diſcovered this particularly in a poem, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled the Convocation, in five cantos; which is a kind of ſatire againſt all the writers who had oppoſed the biſhop Hoadley, in the famous Bangorian controverſy. He tranſlated alſo Mr. Addiſon's Reſurrection, and ſome other of his Latin poems. But his principal literary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, was conducting the celebrated political paper called the Craftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which was written againſt Sir Robert Walpole's miniſtry, and was carried on for a number of years with great ſpirit and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>This paper was more read and attended to than any production of the kind which had hitherto been publiſhed in England. Ten or twelve thouſand were ſold in a day; and the effect which it had in raiſing the indignation of the people, and in controlling the power of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was very conſiderable. This effect was not entirely, or chiefly, owing to the abilities of Mr. Amhurſt. He was aſſiſted by Lord Bolin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, and Mr. Pulteney, and probably by other leaders of the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their fame, and their writings were the grand ſupport of the Craftſman. Nevertheleſs Mr. Amhurſt's own papers are allowed to have been compoſed with ability and ſpirit; and he conducted the Craftſman, in the very zenith of its proſperity, with no ſmall reputation to himſelf. On the 2d of July 1737, there appeared in that publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an ironical letter, written in the name of Colley Cibber, the deſign of which was to ridicule the act which had juſt paſſed for licenſing plays. In this letter the laureat propoſes himſelf to the lord chamberlain to be made ſuperintendant of the old plays, as ſtanding equally in need of correction with the new ones; and produces ſeveral paſſages from Shakeſpeare, and other poets, in relation to kings, queens, princes,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0613800301:192"/>
and miniſters of ſtate, which, he ſays, are now fit to be brought on the ſtage. The printer, &amp;c. having been taken up, by order of government, Mr. Amhurſt voluntarily ſurrendered himſelf in their ſtead, and after having been kept in cuſtody ten days, was obliged to bring his habeas corpus for his liberty before he could obtain it, becauſe he refuſed to give bail for his good behaviour, as well as his appearance. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, we believe prudently, dropped the proſecution. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Amhurſt's merit with his party, he was totally neglected by them, when they made their terms with the crown; and he died ſoon after, of a fever, at Twickenham. His death happened on the 27th of April, 1742; his diſorder was probably occaſioned, in a great meaſure, by the ill uſage he had received. Mr. Ralph, in his Caſe of Authors, ſpeaks with a juſt feeling and indignation upon the ſubject. "Poor Amhurſt! after having been the drudge of his party, for the beſt part of twenty years, was as much forgotten in the famous compromiſe of 1742, as if he had never been born! and died of what is called a broken heart, which happened a few months afterwards; he was indebted to the charity of a bookſeller for a grave; not to be traced now, becauſe then no otherwiſe to be diſtinguiſhed than by the freſhneſs of a turf, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the next common to cover it." A very late writer, in the character of Mr. Pulteney, expreſſes himſelf concerning the treatment of Mr. Amhurſt in the following terms. "But if the Earl of Bath had his liſt of penſioners, how comes it that Amhurſt was forgotten? The fate of this poor man is ſingular. He was the able aſſociate of Bolinbroke and Pulteney, in writing the celebrated weekly paper, called The Craftſman. His abilities were unqueſtionable: he had almoſt as much wit, learning, and various knowledge, as his two partners; and when theſe great maſters choſe not to appear in public themſelves, he ſupplied their places ſo well, that his eſſays were often aſcribed to them."</p>

            <p>AN excellent Latin poet, born at Lucca, in Italy; was ſent by Pope Leo X. to England, in the characters of prothonotary of the apoſtolic ſee, and collector general of this kingdom. Being a man of ſingular genius and learning, he ſoon became acquainted with the principal literati of thoſe times; particularly with Eraſmus, Colet, Grocin, and others; for the ſake of whoſe company he reſided ſome time at Oxford. The advice which Eraſmus gives him, in regard to puſhing his fortune, has a good deal of humour in it, and was certainly intended as a ſatire on the artful methods generally practiſed by the ſelfiſh and ambitious part of mankind. "In the firſt place (ſays he), throw off all ſenſe of ſhame, thruſt yourſelf into every one's buſineſs, and elbow out whomſoever you can; neither love nor hate any one; meaſure every thing by your own advantage; let this be the ſcope and drift of all your actions. Give nothing but what is to be returned with uſury, and be compliant with every body. Have always two ſtrings to your bow. Feign that you are ſolicited by many from abroad, and get every thing ready for your departure. Show letters inviting you elſewhere, with great promiſes." —Ammon was Latin ſecretary to Henry VIII. but at what time he was appointed does not appear. In 1512, he was made canon and prebendary of the collegiate chapel of St. Stephen, in the palace of Weſtminſter. He was likewiſe prebendary of Wells; and in 1514 was preſented to the rectory of Dychial, in that dioceſe. About the ſame time, by the king's ſpecial recommendation, he was alſo made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary of Saliſbury. He died in the year 1517, and was buried in St. Stephen's chapel, in the palace of Weſtminſter. He was eſteemed an elegant Latin writer, and an admirable poet.

At Lady-day 1717, he, with his ſchool-fellow, Mr. Towgood, who has ſince made ſo diſtinguiſhed a figure among the diſſenters, were put under Mr. James and Mr. Grove, who had been long employed before the ſchiſm bill, in educating young men for the miniſtry, but had deſiſted from that employment, until George the Firſt was firmly eſtabliſhed on the throne. Under theſe gentlemen Mr. Amory went through his learning, and in 1722 was examined and approved of as a candidate for the miniſtry.

            <p>In public, as a clergyman, he was greatly reſpected; he conducted the public worſhip with admirable propriety. His diſcourſes were ſolid and affectionate. He was peculiarly fond of dwelling on the providence and perfections of the Deity, the love and obedience we owe him, the evidences of a future ſtate, the excellency of the Goſpel, and the duties of a Chriſtian life. He ſeldom entered on any diſputed point, if he did, it was to expoſe Calviniſm, of which he much diſapproved. His ſentiments of religion coincided with Dr. Samuel Clarke. His learning was ſolid and extenſive. He diligently ſtudied the ſcripture, and was well acquainted with theology, ethics, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental philoſophy, and the writings of the ancients. The following is an account of his works:—1. a Letter to a Friend, publiſhed in the Literary Journal, 1731.—2. A Dialogue on Devotion, after the manner of Xenophon.—3.

He was naturally dull and heavy, but his diligence and application made amends for theſe natural defects. Having taken his degree of maſter of arts at the age of nineteen, he purſued his ſtudies under the royal profeſſors eſtabliſhed by Francis I. viz.

               </gap> Colin, who had the abbey of St. Ambroſe in that city. At the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of this abbot, a ſecretary of ſtate took Amyot into his houſe, to be tutor to his children. The great improvements they made under his direction, induced the ſecretary to recommend him to the princeſs Margaret, ducheſs of Berry, only ſiſter of Francis I. and by means of this recommendation Amyot was made public profeſſor of Greek and Latin in the univerſity of Bourges: he read two lectures a day, for ten years, a Latin lecture in the morning, and a Greek one in the afternoon. It was during this time he tranſlated into French the Amours of Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes and Chariclea, which Francis I. was ſo pleaſed with, that he conferred upon him the abbey of Belloſane. The death of this prince happening ſoon after, Amyot thought it would be better to try his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune elſewhere, than to expect any preferment at the court of France; he therefore accompanied Morvillier to Venice, on his embaſſy from Henry II. to that republic. When Morvillier was recalled from hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was here, that, looking over the manuſcripts of the Vatican (whither he was allowed a free acceſs by Romulus Amaſeiis, keeper of that famous library), he diſcovered that Heliodorus, biſhop of Tricca, was the author of the Amours of Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes. He found alſo a manuſcript of this work, more correct and complete than that which he had tranſlated, and took care to enable himſelf thereby to give a better edition of this work. His la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, however, in this way did not engage him ſo as to divert him from puſhing his fortune: he inſinuated himſelf ſo far into the favour of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal de Tournon, that the cardinal recommended him to the king, to to be preceptor to his two younger ſons. While he was in this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he finiſhed his tranſlation of Plutarch's Lives, which he dedicated to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0613800301:197"/>
the king: he afterwards undertook that of Plutarch's Morals, which he ended in the reign of Charles IX. and dedicated to that prince. Charles conferred upon him the abbey of St. Cornelius de Compiegne, and made him great almoner of France and biſhop of Auxerre; and that of curator of the univerſity of Paris happening to be vacant at the ſame time, he was alſo inveſted in both theſe employments, which Thuanus greatly complains of. Henry III. perhaps would have yielded to the preſſing ſolicitations of the biſhop of St. Flour, who had attended him on his journey into Poland, and made great intereſt for the poſt of great almoner; but the ducheſs of Savoy, the king's aunt, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Amyot ſo earneſtly to him, when he paſſed through Turin, on his return from Poland, that he was not only continued in his employment, but a new honour was added to it for his ſake, for when Henry III. named Amyot commander of the order of the Holy Ghoſt, he decreed at the ſame time, as a mark of reſpect to him, all the great almoners of France ſhould be of courſe commanders of that order. Amyot did not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his ſtudies in the midſt of his honours, but reviſed all his tranſlations with great care, compared them with the Greek text, and altered many paſſages: he deſigned to give a more complete edition of them, with the various readings of divers manuſcripts, but died, before he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that work, the 6th of Feb. 1593, in his ſeventy-ninth year.</p>

            <head>AMYRAUT (MOSES),</head>
            <p>AN eminent French divine, miniſter and profeſſor of divinity at Saumur. He was born in September 1596, at Bourgueil, a ſmall town of Touraine, of an ancient family originally from Orleans. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone through his courſe of philoſophy, he was ſent to Poictiers, to read law, to which he applied himſelf with great aſſiduity, and is ſaid to have ſpent fourteen hours a day in that ſtudy. At the end of his firſt year, he took his degree of licentiate. But Mr. Bouchereau, miniſter of Saumur, having adviſed him to ſtudy divinity, and the reading of Calvin's Inſtitutions having ſtrongly inclined him to follow this advice, he acquainted his father that he earneſtly deſired to be a clergyman, and obtained his aſſent, though not without a great deal of difficulty. He went to ſtudy at Saumur, where he continued a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time as ſtudent of divinity. Upon his admiſſion into orders, he was preſented to the church of St. Agnau, in the country of Mayne, where, after having lived eighteen months, he was invited to Saumur, to ſucceed Mr. Daille, appointed miniſter of Charenton. About the ſame time that the church of Saumur deſired him for their miniſter, the academic council fixed upon him for profeſſor of divinity. His admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the profeſſorſhip, with his previous examination, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augural theſis De Sacerdotio Chriſti, redounded much to his reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0613800301:198"/>In 1613, Mr. Amyraut was ſent deputy to the national council at Charenton; and by this aſſembly was appointed to addreſs the king, and lay before his majeſty their complaints concerning the infraction of the edicts: he was particularly charged not to deliver his ſpeech upon his knees, as the deputies for the former national ſynod had done. He managed this affair with ſo much addreſs, that he was introduced to the king according to the ancient cuſtom, and in the manner that was agreeable to the aſſembly. It was on this occaſion that he became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with cardinal Richlieu, who conceived a great eſteem for him. About this time he publiſhed a piece, wherein he explained the myſtery of predeſtination and grace, according to the hypotheſis of Camero, which occaſioned a kind of civil war amongſt the proteſtant divines of France. Thoſe who diſliked the hypotheſis, derided it as a novelty, eſpecially when they ſaw themſelves joined by the great Du Moulin, who accuſed Amyraut of Arianiſm. The authority of this famous divine, to whom the people paid a great reſpect and veneration, on account of the many books of controverſy he had publiſhed, made ſo deep an impreſſion in the minds of many miniſters, that, though Mr. Amyraut had publiſhed a piece, wherein he maintained that Calvin had held univerſal grace, yet many deputies at the national ſynod of Alencon came charged with inſtructions againſt him, and ſome were even for depoſing him. The deputies of the provinces beyond the Loire were the moſt violent againſt him: however, the ſynod, after having heard Mr. Amyraut explain his opinion, in ſeveral ſeſſions, and anſwer the objections made thereto, honourably acquitted him, and enjoined ſilence in reſpect to queſtions of this nature: but this was not juſtly obſerved by either ſide, for complaints were made againſt Mr. Amyraut, in the national ſynod of Charenton, for having acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the regulations concerning that ſilence; and he, in his turn, complained of infractions of the ſame nature. The aſſembly, by an holy amneſty, ſuppreſſed theſe mutual complaints, and having renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the injunction of ſilence, ſent back Amyraut to his employment, and permitted him to oppoſe foreigners who ſhould attack him, in what manner the ſynod of Anjou ſhould think proper. This ſynod allowed him to publiſh an anſwer to the three volumes of Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemius upon univerſal grace, which occaſioned the writing of ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>When the national ſynod was ſitting in the year 1645, Mr. Amyraut was deſired to enter into a conference with Mr. De la Milletiere, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

original ſin, being attacked in this ſynod, Mr. Amyraut appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aſſembly to plead the cauſe of his colleague; and he made it appear, that the doctrine complained of, was no ways dangerous. His conduct in this affair was highly commended on account of the excellent defence he made in favour of Mr. De la Place's opinion, and becauſe he had no other motive than the intereſt of his colleague; his own opinion as to original ſin being different from that of Mr. De la Place.

What gained him the favour of this cardinal, was, in all probability, his openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring in favour of the obedience due to ſovereigns, which proved very advantageous to the court of France during the troubles of the league againſt cardinal Mazarin, called de la Fronde. In his apology, publiſhed in 1647, in behalf of the proteſtants, he excuſes, as well as he can, the civil wars of France; but he declares at the ſame time, that he by no means intends to juſtify the taking up of arms againſt one's lawful ſovereign upon any pretence whatſoever; and that he always looked upon it as more agreeable to the nature of the goſpel, and the practice of the primitive church, to uſe no other arms but patience, tears, and prayers. But notwithſtanding his attachment to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, he was not for obeying in matters of conſcience, which plainly appeared, when the ſeneſchal of Saumur imparted to him an order from the council of ſtate, enjoining all thoſe of the reformed religion to hang the outſide of their houſes on corpus Chriſti day. The ſeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal notified this order to him the eve of this holiday, entreating him at the ſame time to perſuade the proteſtants to comply with it. To this Mr. Amyraut made anſwer, that, on the contrary, he would go directly and exhort his pariſhioners not to comply with it, as he himſelf was reſolved not to obey ſuch orders; that in all his ſermons he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to inſpire his hearers with obedience and ſubmiſſion to ſuperior powers, but not when their conſciences were concerned. Having thus acquainted the ſeneſchal with his reſolution, he went from houſe to houſe, laying before his pariſhioners the reaſons why he thought they ought not to obey the order of the council. The king's lieutenant, however, not thinking it proper to ſupport the ſeneſchal, this prevented any tumult on that occaſion. Amyraut was a man of ſuch charity and compaſſion, that he beſtowed on the poor his whole

            <head>ANACREON.</head>
            <p>A GREEK poet, born at Teos, a ſea-port of Ionia. Madam Dacier endeavours to prove, from Plato, that he was a kinſman of Solon's, and conſequently allied to the Codridae, the nobleſt family in Athens; but this is not ſufficiently ſupported. The time when he flouriſhed is uncertain; Euſebius placing it in the 62d, Suidas in the 52d, and Mr. Le Fevre in the 72d Olympiad. He is ſaid to have been eighteen years of age when Harpagus, the general of Cyrus, came with an army againſt the confederate cities of the Ionians and Aeolians. The Mileſians immediately ſubmitted themſelves; but the Phocaeans, when they found they were unable to withſtand the enemy, choſe rather to abandon their country than their liberty, and getting a fleet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, tranſported themſelves and families to the coaſt of France, where being hoſpitably received by Nannus the king of the country, they built Marſeilles. The Teians ſoon followed their example; for Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagus having made himſelf maſter of their walls, they unanimouſly went on board their ſhips, and ſailing to Thrace, fixed themſelves in the city Abdera; where they had not been long, when the Thracians, jealous of their neighbours, endeavoured to give them diſturbance; and in theſe conflicts it ſeems to be, that Anacreon loſt thoſe friends whom he celebrates in his epigrams. This poet had certainly a delicate wit, as may be judged from the many beauties which ſhine throughout his works; but he was rather too fond of pleaſures, for love and wine had the diſpoſal of all his hours.</p>
            <p>Anacreon left Abdera, and went to the court of Polycrates at Samo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, where he was received with great marks of friendſhip; and it was here he became enamoured with the handſome Bathyllus.</p>
            <p>He had another favourite, named Smerdias, the ſon of a Thracian prince, who had been given as a preſent to Polycrates by ſome Grecian pirates.</p>
            <p>He is ſaid to have been in love with the fair Cleobulus, whom he had like to have killed when a child, in the arms of his nurſe, by rudely joſtling her as he reeled one day through the ſtreets, when he was in liquor; and not content with this, he abuſed the child with ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous language: the nurſe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

               </gap> abuſed him. Her wiſhes were fulfilled, for Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus grew to be a beautiful youth, and Anacreon falling in love with
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0613800301:201"/>
him, wrote ſeveral verſes in his praiſe. Aelian has endeavoured to clear Anacreon of the ſuſpicion of entertaining any diſhonourable paſſion for theſe youths; but the general charge againſt him in this reſpect is ſo ſtrong that the imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tation lies heavy upon his memory. How long Anacreon continued at Samos is uncertain, but it is probable he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there during the greateſt part of the reign of Polycrates, which ſeems to be confirmed by Herodotus, who aſſures us, that Anacreon was with that prince in his chamber when he received a meſſage from Oraetes governor of Sardys, by whoſe treachery Polycrates was ſoon after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and inhumanly crucified. It ſeems to have been a little before this that Anacreon left Samos and removed to Athens, having been invited thither by Hipparchus the eldeſt ſon of Piſiſtratus, one of the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and learned princes of his time, who, as Plato aſſures us, ſent an obliging letter, with a veſſel of fifty oars to convey him over the Aegean ſea. After Hipparchus was ſlain by the conſpiracy of Harmodius and Ariſtogiton, Anacreon returned to Teos, where he remained till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of Hiſtiaeus, when he was obliged once more to remove to Abdera, where he died. The manner of his death is ſaid to have been very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, for they tell us that he was choaked with a grape-ſtone, which he ſwallowed as he was regaling on ſome new wine.</p>
            <p>There is but a ſmall part of Anacreon's works which remain. Beſides his odes and epigrams, he compoſed elegies, hymns, and iambics. His poems which are extant conſiſt chiefly of Bacchanalian ſongs and love-ſonnets. How much he was the delight of both ancients and modern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> appears from the praiſes they have beſtowed upon him.</p>
            <p>The verſes of Anacreon, ſays Scaliger, are ſweeter than Indian ſugar. His beauty, ſays Madam Dacier, and chiefeſt excellence lay in imitating nature, and in following reaſon, ſo that he preſented to the mind no images but what were noble and natural. The odes of Anacreon, ſays Rapin, are flowers, beauties, and perpetual graces; it is familiar to him to write what is natural, and to the life, he having an air ſo delicate, ſo eaſy, and ſo graceful, that among all the ancients there is nothing comparable to the method he took, nor to that kind of writing he followed. He flows ſoft and eaſy, every where diffuſing the joy and indolence of his mind through his verſe, and tuning his harp to the ſmooth and pleaſant temper of his ſoul</p>

He left Geneva in April 1641, and offered himſelf to the ſynod of Charenton in order to take upon him the office of a miniſter: his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were greatly admited by the examiners, and the whole aſſembly was ſo highly pleaſed with him, that they gave him the church of Meaux, the moſt conſiderable then unprovided for.

He returned to his own country in the year 1653, where he remained till the revocation of the edict of Nantz in 1685. He retired to Francfort after this fatal blow; and having preached in the French church at Hanau, the whole aſſembly was ſo edified by it, that they immediately called together the heads of the families, in order to propoſe that he might be invited to accept of being miniſter there.

happened at Berlin the 3d of September, 1692, when he was ſeventy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five years of age.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ancillon having got a good deal of money by marriage, was enabled thereby to gratify his paſſion for books; his library was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly very curious and large, and he increaſed it every day with all that appeared new and important in the republic of letters, ſo that at laſt it was one of the nobleſt collections in the hands of any private perſon in the kingdom; ſuch foreigners as were curious viſited it, when they paſſed through the city of Metz, as the moſt valuable curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there. Mr. Ancillon publiſhed at Sedan a volume in quarto, in the year 1657, in which the whole diſpute concerning traditions is amply and ſolidly examined. This is a faithful account of all that paſſed in the conference which he had with Mr. Bedacier, doctor of Sorbonne, biſhop of Auguſte, and ſuffragan of the biſhop of Metz: he diſputed with him before ſeveral perſons, at firſt in his own houſe, and afterwards before a large audience in the biſhop's palace. Mr. Bedacier thought proper to break off the diſpute, alledging it was much better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the argument by writing than perſonal diſputation: it was agreed however that neither party ſhould publiſh the particulars of this confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. There was a monk, notwithſtanding, who took upon him to print a falſe account of it, whoſe impudence was ſo flagrant, that although Mr. Ancillon had managed this conteſt with great honour to himſelf, yet he attempted to perſuade the public that it was very fatal to him and to his party, and that he loſt the victory in it irrecoverably. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned Mr. Ancillon to publiſh the book abovementioned. When the Method of cardinal Richlieu appeared, Ancillon wrote a full and excellent anſwer to it; but he underſtood that Mr. Martel, profeſſor at Montauban, had written one, which was ready to be publiſhed; and that Mr. Claude, who had the ſame deſign, had deſiſted from executing it for the ſame reaſon, as appears from the third letter of his collection of letters in the fifth tome of his poſthumous works; he ſuppreſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what he had done, and publiſhed only ſome ſheets, which contain an anſwer to the ſixth chapter of that Method, or, an Apology for Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, and Beza; which was the title of this piece in the edition publiſhed at Hanau in 1666. He publiſhed alſo the Life of William Farel, or the Idea of a faithful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. The famous Mr. Conrart, who was one of his intimate friends, read this, and approved it, and wrote with his own hands ſeveral remarks in the margin of the manuſcript. Though Mr. Ancillon explained ſeveral entire books of the holy Scripture, and wrote all his ſermons, yet he never could be perſuaded to print them: all that we have of him of that kind is a ſermon preached at Metz on a faſt-day; the conſiſtory

uſed ſome ſort of authority to make him print it, which was done at Paris in 1676. This ſermon his upon the 18th and 19th verſes of the third chapter of St. Paul's Epiſtle to the Philippians, and is intitled the Tears of St. Paul. He wrote at laſt an excellent anſwer to the Paſtoral Advice, the Circular Letters, and the Method, which the clergy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the reformed of France, in the year 1682. We cannot form a truer idea of the variety of learning which enlivened his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, than from a book intitled Melange critique de Litterature recuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li des converſations de feu Mr. Ancillon: it was publiſhed at Baſil in 1698, in two volumes in duodecimo, by Mr. Ancillon the advocate, the eldeſt ſon of the miniſter, a gentleman well known in the republic of letters.</p>

            <p>A YOUNGER brother of a good family in Lincolnſhire, deſcended originally from Scotland. He received the firſt part of his education in the country, and went afterwards to Lincoln college in Oxford: from thence he removed to the Inner Temple, where he read law with great aſſiduity, and in due time was called to the bar; and in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of the reign of queen Elizabeth, he was appointed one of the queen's ſerjeants at law.

In 1586, he was appointed one of the commiſſioners for trying Mary queen of Scots; on the 12th of October, the ſame year, he ſat in judgment upon her, and on the 25th of the ſame month he ſat again in the ſtar-chamber, when ſentence was pronounced againſt that unhappy queen. In 1587, he ſat in the ſtar-chamber, on ſecretary Daviſon, who was charged with iſſuing the warrant for the execution of the queen of Scots, contrary to queen Elizabeth's command, and without her knowledge: after the cauſe had been heard, Sir Roger Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, chief baron of the exchequer, gave his opinion firſt, wherein he extolled the queen's clemency, which he ſaid Daviſon had prevented, and therefore he was for fining him ten thouſand pounds, and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during the queen's pleaſure.

It is highly probable the judge himſelf was ſenſible of the ill-will his proceedings againſt the diſſenters from the eſtabliſhed church drew upon him; but it does not appear that it gave him any great pain, ſince in 1596, we have an account of his going to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0613800301:206"/>
the northern circuit, where he behaved with the ſame rigour, declaring in his charges, that ſuch perſons as oppoſed the eſtabliſhed church, oppoſed her majeſty's authority, and were in that light enemies to the ſtate, and diſturbers of the public peace; wherefore, of ſuch he directed the grand juries to inquire, that they might be puniſhed. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a very ſtrict lawyer, who governed himſelf entirely by ſtatutes: this he ſhewed on many occaſions, particularly at the trial of Henry Cuffe, ſecretary to the Earl of Eſſex, where the attorney-general charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the priſoner ſyllogiſtically, and Cuffe anſwering him in the ſame ſtyle, lord chief juſtice Anderſon ſaid ſmartly, "I ſit here to judge of law, and not of logic;" and directed Mr. attorney to preſs the ſtatute of Edward III. on which Mr. Cuffe was indicted. He was reputed ſevere, and ſtrict in the obſervation of what was taught in courts, and laid down as law by reports; but this ought to be conſidered a vulgar opinion, for we have his expreſs declaration to the contrary, and that he neither expected precedents in all caſes, nor would be bound by them where he ſaw they were not founded upon juſtice, but would act as if there were no ſuch precedents. Of this we have a proof from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in his time, publiſhed by Mr. Goldeſborough: "The caſe of Reſceit was moved again; and Shuttleworth ſaid, that he cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, becauſe he is named in the writ; and ſaid, that he had ſearched all the books, and there is not one caſe where he which is named in the writ, may be received." "What of that? (ſaid judge Anderſon) ſhall we not give judgment, becauſe it is not adjudged in the books before? we will give judgment according to reaſon; and if there be no reaſon in the books, I will not regard them." His ſteadineſs was ſo great, that he would not be driven from what he thought right, by any authority whatever, as appeared in the caſe of Cavendiſh, a creature of the Earl of Leiceſter's, who had procured, by his intereſt, the queen's letters patent for making out writs of ſuperſedeas upon exigents in the court of common pleas, and a meſſage was ſent to the judges to admit him to that office; with which, as they conceived the queen had no right to grant any ſuch patent, they did not comply. Upon this, Mr. Caven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, by the aſſiſtance of his patron, obtained a letter from the queen to quicken them, which however did not produce what was expected from it. The courtier however purſued his point, and obtained another let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the queen's ſignet and ſign manual; this letter was delivered in preſence of the lord chancellor and the Earl of Leiceſter, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Eaſter term, and the judges deſired time to conſider it; and then anſwered, that they could not comply with the letter, becauſe it was inconſiſtent with their duty and their oaths of office.

            <p>A LEARNED Portugueſe, born at Conimbria, who diſtinguiſhed himſelf at the council of Trent, where king Sebaſtian ſent him as one of his divines. He preached before the aſſembly the ſecond Sunday after Eaſter, in 1562. Nor was he contented with the ſervice he did in explaining thoſe points upon which he was conſulted, but he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his pen in defence of the canons of the council, in a treatiſe intitled Orthodoxarum Explicationum lib. x. which is a reply to a book publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chemnitius, againſt the doctrine of the Jeſuits, before the cloſe of the council of Trent; and as Chemnitius took this opportunity of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very large work, intitled Examen Concilii Tridentini, Andrada thought himſelf obliged to defend his firſt piece againſt this learned ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. He compoſed therefore a book, which his two brothers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed after his death, at Liſbon, in 1578, intitled Defenſio Tridentinae Fidei Catholicae, quinque libris comprehenſa, adverſus Haereticorum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnias, et praeſertim Martini Chemnitii. Theſe pieces of Andrada have been printed ſeveral times, yet they are difficult to be met with. There is ſcarce any catholic author who has been more quoted by the proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants than he, becauſe he maintained ſome opinions a little extravagant concerning the ſalvation of the heathens. Andrada was eſteemed an

            <p>A FAMOUS Lutheran divine, of the ſixteenth century, born at Waibling, in the duchy of Wirtemberg, on the 25th of March, 1528. His parents being poor, intended to bring him up to ſome mechanical buſineſs, and had agreed with a carpenter for that purpoſe; but ſeveral perſons of diſtinction having diſcovered in him the marks of a promiſing genius, contributed to ſupport him in the proſecution of his ſtudies: he was accordingly educated under Alexander Marcoleon, and in the ſpace of two years made himſelf maſter of the Latin and Greek, and logic. In 1541, he was ſent to Tubing, where he took his degree of bachelor of arts two years after; and having finiſhed his courſe of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy in 1545, he became maſter of arts.

In the beginning of the year 1576, he was ſent for by Phillip Lewis, Count Palatine of the Rhine, to conſult upon eccleſiaſtical affairs: and by the magiſtrates of Ratiſbon, to determine a diſpute between the miniſters of that church and the ſenate, concerning excommunication. While he was abſent upon theſe affairs, Auguſtus Elector of Saxony wrote letters to Lewis Duke of Wirtemberg, to deſire the aſſiſtance of Andreas, becauſe he found that the divines of Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg had introduced the Zuinglian doctrines, and propagated them among the youth: Andreas therefore went to Torga in April following, and was preſent at the aſſembly of divines held there, to ſettle a form of agreement, and put an end to the diſputes which were raiſed in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts. To this aſſembly the elector had likewiſe invited ſeveral other eminent divines, who wrote in conjunction a book, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reviſed at Bergen. Andreas was ſent by the Elector of Saxony, upon the ſame account, to Julius Duke of Brunſwick, Lewis Landgrave of Heſſe, and George Marquis of Brandenburg. In 1586, he was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a conference, at Mompelgard, with Theodore Beza, concerning the Lord's ſupper, the perſon of Chriſt, predeſtination, baptiſm, the reformation of the popiſh churches, and other things; but this had the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon the publication of the conference at Mompelgard abovementioned, he was accuſed of having falſely imputed ſome things to Beza, which the latter had never aſſerted; he therefore went to Bern, to clear himſelf of the charge. His laſt

public act was a conference at Baden, in November 1589, with John Piſtorius. When he found death drawing near, he made a declaration to ſeveral of his friends, of his conſtancy in the faith which he had aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhewed the moſt undoubted ſigns of a ſincere devotion till he expired, on the 7th of January, 1590, being ſixty-one years and nine months old. The following character is given him by Melchior Adam: "He was (ſays this author) an excellent preacher, had an eaſy manner of inſtructing the people, and delivered the moſt obſcure points in ſuch a perſpicuous ſtyle, that they were underſtood by the generality of the audience.

In executing the ſeveral branches of his duty, he ſpared no labour, and was deterred by no fatigue. He was perpetually engaged in compoſing ſome work or other, or in writing letters, upon various ſubjects, to perſons of all ranks who conſulted him: theſe things he diſpatched with admirable quickneſs and ſucceſs. There was hardly a day paſſed, but he gave advice to ſeveral perſons; being always ready to gratify thoſe who ſolicited his aſſiſtance. He was in great favour with princes and men of the higheſt rank, his converſation being very agreeable and faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. He had a warm zeal for the religion which he profeſſed, and was extremely ſorry whenever he heard that any perſon had abandoned it." He wrote a great number of books, the moſt remarkable of which was his book on Concord, and ſome treatiſes he had wrote on the Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Chriſt.</p>

He had always a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſpect for this profeſſor, paying as great deference to his gloſſes as the text itſelf. Guy de Baïf perceiving that Andreas, for want of money, could not demand his doctor's degree, procured it him gratis, which Andreas himſelf acknowledges. The ſame profeſſor puſhed him on to ſtand for a profeſſorſhip, which he obtained. Andreas was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor at Padua about the year 1330; but he was recalled to Bologna,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0613800301:211"/>
where he acquired the greateſt reputation. We are told wonderful things concerning the auſterity of his life, that he macerated his body with prayer and faſting, and lay upon the bare ground for twenty years together, covered only with a bear-ſkin: this is atteſted by very good authors; but if the ſtory which Poggius tells of him, in his jeſts, be true, he muſt afterwards have relaxed much of this continency: "<hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annem Andream</hi> (ſays he) <hi>doctorem Bononienſem cujus fama admodum vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata eſt, ſubagitantem ancillam domeſticam uxor deprehendit: re inſueta ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefacta mulier in virum verſa, Ubi nunc, ait, Joannes, eſt ſapientia veſtra? ille nil amplius locutus. In vulva iſtius, reſpondit, loco admodum ſapientiae accommodato.</hi> Andreas had a beautiful daughter, named No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vella, whom he loved extremely, and he is ſaid to have inſtructed her ſo well in all parts of learning, that when he was engaged in any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair which hindered him from reading lectures to his ſcholars, he ſent his daughter in his room; and leſt her beauty ſhould prevent the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the hearers, ſhe had a little curtain drawn before her. To perpetuate the memory of his daughter, he intitled his Commentary upon the Decretals of Gregory IX. the Novellae. He married her to John Calderinus, a learned canoniſt. The firſt work of Andreas was his Gloſs upon the ſixth book of the Decretals, which he wrote when he was very young. He wrote alſo Gloſſes upon the Clementines, and a Commentary in Regulas Sexti, which he intitled Mercuriales, becauſe he either engaged in it on Wedneſdays, diebus Mercurii, or becauſe he inſerted his Wedneſdays' diſputes in it. He enlarged the Speculum of Durant, in the year 1347. This is all which Mr. Bayle mentions of his writings, though he wrote many more. Andreas died of the plague at Bologna, in 1348, after he had been a profeſſor five-and-forty years, and was buried in the church of the Dominicans. Many eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums have been beſtowed upon him, having been called archidoctor decretorum; in his epitaph he has the title of "<hi>Rabbi doctorum, lux, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, normaque morum:</hi> rabbi of the doctors, the light, cenſor, and rule of manners." And it is ſaid, that Pope Boniface called him <hi>lumen mundi,</hi> the light of the world. Mr. Bayle ſays it was pity Andreas followed the method of the Pyrrhoniſts ſo much; that he proved his own opinion very ſolidly when he had a mind to it, but this he ſeldom did, chuſing rather to relate the ſentiments of others, and to leave his readers in the midſt of the diſpute.</p>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0613800301:212"/>
where he lived ſeveral years. He was one of the moſt conſtant auditors of Gerard de Neuville, a famous phyſician and philoſopher; and as he had a deſire to obtain a public profeſſorſhip, he prepared himſelf for it by ſeveral lectures, which he read in philoſophy. He returned to his own country in 1628, where he did not continue long, but went to Groningen, being ſent for by Henry Alting. He read lectures upon all parts of philoſophy for ſome time, after which Alting got him to be tutor to the ſon of a prince Palatine, in which employment he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued three years, part of which he ſpent at Leyden, and part at the Hague at the court of the Prince of Orange. He was called to Groningen in 1634, to ſucceed Janus Gebhardus, who had been profeſſor of hiſtory and Greek. He diſcharged this truſt in the moſt faithful manner till his death, which happened the 17th of October, 1676. Andreas was a great ſtickler for Mr. Des Cartes, which he ſhewed during the life and after the death of that philoſopher: he wrote in defence of him againſt a profeſſor of Leyden, whoſe name was Revius, and publiſhed an anſwer to him in 1653, intitled Methodi Carteſianae aſſertio oppoſita Jacobi Revii praef. Methodi Carteſianae conſiderationi theologicae. The ſecond part of this anſwer appeared the year following. He wrote likewiſe, in 1653, againſt Mr. Regius, in defence of the remarks of Mr. Des Cartes upon a programma, which contained an explication of the human mind. He taught the Carteſian philoſophy in his own houſe, though his profeſſorſhip did not oblige him to that, and even when his age had quite weakened him. Mr. Des Marets acquaints us with theſe particulars, making mention of a Swiſs ſtudent who dared not venture to attend upon the philoſophical lectures of Tobias Andreas, for fear it ſhould be known in his own country, where it might prove an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to his promotion in the miniſtry.</p>

After he had taken the degree of bachelor of arts, he was choſen fellow of the college: ſoon after having taken the degree of maſter of arts, he applied himſelf to the ſtudy of divinity; and being choſen catechiſt in the college, he read a lecture on the ten
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0613800301:214"/>
commandments every Saturday and Sunday, to which great numbers out of the other colleges of the univerſity, and even out of the country, reſorted as to a divinity lecture. His reputation increaſing daily, he began to be taken notice of by Sir Francis Walſingham, ſecretary of ſtate to queen Elizabeth, who being unwilling ſo fine a genius ſhould be buried in the country, procured him the vicarage of St. Giles's Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plegate, in London; and got him afterwards choſen a prebendary and reſidentiary of St. Paul's, and alſo prebendary of the collegiate church of Southwell. Being thus preferred, he diſtinguiſhed himſelf as a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and excellent preacher, and read divinity lectures three times a week at St. Paul's, in term time. Upon the death of Dr. Fulke, he was choſen maſter of Pembroke hall, to which college he became a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable benefactor. He was alſo appointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to queen Elizabeth, who took great delight in his preaching. He was in no leſs eſteem with her ſucceſſor James I. who gave him the preference above all other divines as a preacher, and made choice of him to vindicate his ſovereignty. His majeſty having, in his Defence of the Rights of Kings, aſſerted the authority of Chriſtian princes over cauſes and perſons eccleſiaſtical, Cardinal Bellarmine, under the name of Matthew Tortus, attacked him with great vehemency and bitterneſs. The king employed Andrews to anſwer the cardinal, who did it with great ſpirit and judgment, in a piece intitled Tortura Torti, etc. His majeſty upon this promoted him to the biſhopric of Chicheſter, to which he was conſecrated November 3, 1605: and at the ſame time made him his almoner; in which place Dr. Andrews behaved with great honour and fidelity, not even making thoſe advantages to himſelf which he might legally have done. Upon the vacancy of the biſhopric of Ely, he was advanced to that ſee, and conſecrated September 22, 1609. He was alſo nominated one of the king's privy counſellors of England, and afterwards of Scotland when he attended his majeſty to that kingdom. When he had been nine years in the ſee of Ely, he was advanced to the biſhopric of Wincheſter, and deanry of the king's chapel, which two laſt preferments he held till his death. There is a pleaſant ſtory related of him, while he was biſhop of Wincheſter, in the life of Waller the poet: Waller going to ſee the king at dinner, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard a very extraordinary converſation between his majeſty, the biſhop of Wincheſter, and Dr. Neale, biſhop of Durham. Theſe two prelates ſtanding behind the king's chair, his majeſty aſked them, "My lords (ſaid he) cannot I take my ſubjects money when I want it, without all this formality in parliament?" the biſhop of Durham readily anſwered, "God forbid, Sir, but you ſhould; you are the breath of our noſtrils."

This great prelate was in no leſs reputation and eſteem with king Charles I. than he had been with his predeceſſors. He died at Wincheſter-houſe in Southwark, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 27, 1626, in the ſeventy-firſt year of his age, and was buried in the pariſh church of St. Saviour's, where his executors erected to him a very fair monument of marble and alabaſter, on which is an elegant inſcription, written by one of his chaplains. Mr. Milton has wrote alſo a beautiful elegy on his death, in the ſame language. In the dedication of his ſermons, publiſhed under the care and inſpection of Dr. Laud, biſhop of London, and the biſhop of Ely above mentioned, we have the following character of this prelate: "The perſon whoſe works theſe are, was from his youth a man of extraordinary worth and note; a man as if he had been made up of learning and virtue, both of them ſo eminent in him, that it is hard to judge which had precedency. His virtue (which we muſt ſtill judge the more worthy in any man) was comparable to that which was to be found in the primitive biſhop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for his learning, it was as well, if not better, known abroad than reſpected at home: and take him in his latitude, we, which knew him well, knew not any ſort of learning to which he was a ſtranger; but in his profeſſion, admirable. None ſtronger than he, where he wreſtled with an adverſary; and that Bellarmine felt, who was as well able to ſhift for himſelf as any that ſtood up for the Roman party. None more exact, more judicious, than he, where he was to inſtruct and inform others; and that as they knew, who often heard him preach, ſo they may learn which will read this which he hath left behind him. And yet this fulneſs of his material learning left room enough in the temper of his brain for almoſt all languages, learned and modern, to ſeat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſo that his learning had all the helps language could afford, and his languages learning enough for the beſt of them to expreſs; his judgment, in the mean time, ſo commanding over both, as that neither of them was ſuffered idly or curiouſly to ſtart from or fall ſhort of their

Beſides the Tortura Torti, already mentioned, biſhop Andrews wrote a Manual of private Devotions and Meditations for every Day in the Week; and a Manual of Directions for the Viſitation of the Sick: there were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeveral ſermons and tracts in Engliſh and Latin of his, publiſhed after his death.

When he was in England, he lived a conſiderable time in the family of Sir Kenelm Digby, and

ſeems to have had a great eſteem for the opinions of this gentleman, as may be ſeen in his writings, particularly in the preface to his Latin work, concerning the Inſtitutions of the Peripatetic Philoſophy, according to the hypotheſis of Sir Kenelm. He was a great advocate for the peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetic philoſophy. He attempted even to make the principles of Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle ſubſervient to the explaining the moſt impenetrable myſteries of religion: and with this view he engaged in the diſcuſſion of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, free-will, and grace. Mr. Baillet ſays, "What he wrote upon this ſubject reſembles the ancient oracles for obſcurity." His anſwer to this accuſation brought againſt him by ſeveral authors, may not perhaps be improperly mentioned here, as it gives an idea of the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of his temper and genius: "I value myſelf (ſays he) upon a bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and conciſeneſs, which is ſuitable to the teachers of ſcience.

            <p>COMMONLY called Michael of Bologna, a divine of diſtinguiſhed learning in the fourteenth century. Born at Bologna in Italy, where he entered into the order of the Carmelites. He ſtudied afterwards at the univerſity of Paris, where he received his degree of doctor. In the general chapter of his order, held at Ferrara in 1354, in that of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux in 1358, and in that of Treves in 1362, he was named regent of the convent at Paris.

            <p>The great ſchiſm which divided the church after the death of pope Gregory IX. occaſioned likewiſe a diviſion amongſt the religious orders, particularly that of the Carmelites. The convents of Germany, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Bohemia, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Pruſſia, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Frieſland, and ſeveral other provinces contiguous to Germany, together with Tuſcany, Lombardy, and the other countries of Italy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged pope Urban VI. but thoſe of France, Spain, Scotland, and Naples, ſupported the party of pope Clement VII. which was joined alſo by Bernard Olenſis, or Oleri, the ſeventeenth general of the order of the Carmelites, and for this reaſon he was depoſed by pope Urban, who gave orders, in the general chapter held at Bruges in 1379, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperior ſhould be elected out of the countries which had ſubmitted to his authority. The chapter obeyed the pope's directions, and choſe Angriani under the title of vicar general, which was confirmed by a bull of that pope, dated the 19th of April, 1380; and the year following he was choſen general of the order by the chapter held at Verona; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials of the provinces who declared for Clement VII. not being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, their places were ſupplied by other monks named in their room; and in 1385, he had the ſame honour conferred on him by the general chapter held at Bamberge, in the province of Upper Germany. But the year following going to Genoa, to wait upon pope Urban VI. he was depoſed from his office, without any cauſe alledged for it; ſome perſons indeed ſuppoſed it might be oweing to his being an intimate friend and confident of certain cardinals whom the pope cauſed to be put to death about that time; others imagined it to be owing to ſome ſuſpicions which the pope entertained againſt the archdeacon of Bruges, who had been Angriani's ſcholar.

            <p>EARL of Angleſey, and Lord Privy Seal in the reign of Charles II. He was the ſon of Sir Francis Anneſley, Baronet, Lord Mount Norris,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0613800301:220"/>
and Viſcount Valentia, in Ireland; by his firſt wife Dorothy, daughter to Sir John Phillips of Picton caſtle, Pembrokeſhire. He was born in Dublin, July 10th, 1614, and had his Chriſtian name from his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, the Lord Chicheſter deputy of Ireland. He was removed to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land when ten years old, was ſent to the univerſity of Oxford when ſixteen, and becoming a fellow commoner in Magdalen college, was placed under an experienced tutor, in 1630. Here he purſued his ſtudies for three or four years, eſteemed as a youth whoſe hopeful genius was an honour to his college, and enjoying the friendſhip of the preſident, Dr. Frewen, (afterwards archbiſhop of York), and many eminent perſons, among whom was the celebrated Dr. Hammond. In 1634, he was removed to Lincoln's-Inn, where he ſtudied law with great ſucceſs, till his father thought proper to ſend him on the tour of Europe; from which, after ſome ſtay at Rome, he returned to England in 1640. The ſame year he was elected knight of the ſhire for Radnor; but quickly loſt his ſeat by a vote of the commons, which declared C. Price <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> duly elected. In the beginning of the civil war he inclined to the royal cauſe; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſo perfectly reconciled himſelf to the parliament, that he was ſent by that body as commiſſioner into Ulſter, in the year 1645. An arduous undertaking, conſidering to how low an ebb the Engliſh intereſt was brought by means of the Scotch forces, under General Monroe, having been long in poſſeſſion of thoſe parts. However Mr. Anneſley conducted himſelf with ſuch addreſs, that the great rebel, Owen O'Neil was diſappointed in his deſigns, both on this province and on that of Connaught. The popiſh archbiſhop of Tuam, who was the great oracle of his party, and whoſe councils had hitherto been very ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, was not only taken priſoner, but his papers ſeized, and his foreign correſpondence diſcovered, by which all the deſigns of the rebels were broken, and vaſt advantages accrued to the proteſtant intereſt.

This was certainly a very ſignal ſervice not only to thoſe who employed him, but to the whole proteſtant intereſt in Ireland, which was then on the very point of being extinguiſhed. However after the commiſſioners

After the death of Cromwell, when the rump reſumed their old power, Mr. Anneſley, though he doubted whether the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not diſſolved by the death of the king, reſolved to get into the houſe if it were poſſible; in which good deſign he got ſeveral wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gentlemen to concur with him, but with little ſucceſs, though the ſcheme was managed with great wiſdom and ſpirit, ſuch as ſufficiently declared what his real ſentiments were, and how much he had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettling the conſtitution at heart. In the confuſions which followed he had little or no ſhare, as being too well known to be truſted either by the rump or the army; and beſides, he was ſhrewdly ſuſpected of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt of Sir George Booth's inſurrection, if not of being concerned in it. But when things began to take a better turn, by the reſtoring of the ſecluded members to their ſeats, February 21, 1660, Mr. Anneſley began again to make a figure, and to appear in his old character, that of a true patriot. In this he appeared with ſuch luſtre, that he was choſen preſident of the new council of ſtate, having at that time a correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with his majeſty King Charles II. then in exile; which coſt him the life of his dear brother, who was drowned in ſtopping into a packet-boat with letters for his majeſty. Soon after the reſtoration, viz. on the 20th of April, 1661, he was raiſed to the dignity of a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of England, by the title of Lord Anneſley of Newport Pagnel, in the county of Bucks; as alſo of an earl, by the ſtyle of * * * * * * which ſome little time after was changed for that of Angleſey. In the preamble of the patent, notice is expreſsly taken of the ſervices rendered by him in the king's reſtoration: nay, ſome tell us, that his lordſhip might have been prime miniſter, if he had not declined it, to avoid envy. However he had always a conſiderable ſhare in the king's favour; and was heard with great attention at council, and in the houſe of lords. He certainly ſhowed his extreme deteſtation of the king's murder, by his ſitting in judgment on the regicides at Hicks's hall, and the Old

Bailey, though the Oxford hiſtorian reflects upon this, inſinuating that he had been as deep in thoſe matters as the perſons then tried, which is a palpable falſity. Many reflections of this ſort he bore in his life-time with great conſtancy, or rather indifference, being deſirous of diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duty to his king and country without hurting others, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſolicitous of making great advantages to himſelf; yet as he ſerved a generous maſter, he received from him offices both of profit and truſt. In 1667 he was made treaſurer of the navy; and on the 4th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1671-2, his majeſty in council was pleaſed to appoint the Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Angleſey, the Lord Holles, the Lord Aſhley, and Mr. Secretary Trevor, or any three of them, to be a committee, to peruſe and reviſe all the papers and writings concerning the ſettlement of Ireland, from the firſt to the laſt, and to make an abſtract of the ſtate thereof in writing. And accordingly, on the 12th of June, 1672, they made their report at large, which was the foundation of a commiſſion, dated the 1ſt of Auguſt, 1672, to Prince Rupert, the Dukes of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham and Lauderdale, Earl of Angleſey, Lords Aſhley and Holles, Sir John Trevor, and Sir Thomas Chichley, to inſpect the ſettlement of Ireland, and all proceedings in order thereunto. And this was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another commiſſion of the ſeventeenth of January, 1672-3, to Prince Rupert, &amp;c. whereunto the Duke of Ormond, the Earl of Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and the lord treaſurer Clifford, were added to inſpect the affairs of Ireland, viz. the acts of ſettlement and explanation, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, and the diſpoſing the forfeited lands, and the ſtate of his majeſty's revenue, &amp;c. After which, by reaſon of his ſingular pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and fidelity the Earl of Angleſey had the great office of lord privy ſeal conferred on him, the 22d of April, 1673, and all this, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great variety of attempts made to prejudice him, as well in the king's as in the public opinion; all which he not only effectually defeated by clearly expoſing them, and manifeſting his own innocence, but alſo turned them to his advantage, ſo as to riſe more by the intrigues of his enemies, than by any art of his own. The long experience his lordſhip had of men and things, rendered him ſo true a judge of merit, that he could diſcover it in men of all perſuaſions, and his freedom from prejudice was ſuch, that he could hate it in none, how different ſoever from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf they might be in religious or political opinions. This noble diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition rendered him liable to a formidable attack, during the time of the popiſh plot; when to have behaved with decency towards the Roman Catholics of any rank, was ſufficient to ſtigmatize the ſincereſt Proteſtant, with the dangerous character of being a favourer of Papiſts. One Danger-field, whoſe name will be tranſmitted to late poſterity, as a diſcoverer of plots, true and falſe, on the 20th of Oct. 1680, charged his lordſhip, in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0613800301:223"/>
an information delivered upon oath, at the bar of the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, with endeavouring to ſtifle evidence, with relation to the popiſh plot, and to promote the belief of a Preſbyterian one, with many other things alike probable, or rather alike improbable, yet ſo far credited at that time as to receive countenance from the houſe. The trouble he received from this baſe attack, did not hinder him from ſpeaking his opinion freely upon thoſe matters in the houſe of lords, particularly in relation to the Iriſh plot, of which he declared his abſolute diſbelief, when few durſt own they ſuſpected it, notwithſtanding the apparent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture in the accounts given of it. His charity for men of all religions did not, however, abate either his zeal for the proteſtant cauſe, or his affection for the true intereſt of his country. The Earl of Caſtlehaven thought fit, in the year 1680, to write his Memoirs, in which he took a great deal of pains to repreſent the general rebellion in Ireland, in the lighteſt colours poſſible, and as if it had been far from univerſal at firſt, and that it was made ſo, at leaſt as much by the meaſures purſued by ſuch as ought to have ſuppreſſed them, as by any ill intention of the Catholics concerned in it. The Earl of Angleſey having received theſe memoirs from their author, thought fit to write ſome animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon them, which he did in a letter to the Earl of Caſtlehaven, wherein he takes notice of abundance of remarkable paſſages in thoſe diſtracted times; and, as his ſubject led him, delivered his opinion freely in reſpect to the Duke of Ormond, and his management of affairs in that kingdom. This letter to the Earl of Caſtlehaven was written in Auguſt 1680, but was not publiſhed till 1681. The Duke of Ormond, about a year afterwards, expoſtulated with the lord privy ſeal, on this ſubject, by letter, to which the earl replied; and there the matter reſted. In 1682, when the nation was in a high ferment, the earl drew up a very particular remonſtrance, dated April the 27th, the ſame year, and preſented it to his majeſty. It was very warm and very loyal; and yet it was far from being well received. It was not, however, thought proper to remove him from his high office on this account; and therefore, in the month of June, 1682, the Duke of Ormond, then lord-lieutenant of Ireland, was prevailed upon to exhibit a charge againſt the lord privy ſeal, on account of his reflections on the Earl of Caſtlehaven's Memoirs. This produced a ſharp diſpute between thoſe two peers, which ended in the Earl of Angleſey's loſing his place of lord privy ſeal, though it certainly raiſed his reputation; his very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being forced to confeſs, that he was both hardly and unjuſtly treated. After this misfortune, which happened in Auguſt 1682, his lordſhip remained pretty much at his country-ſeat at Blechingdon, in Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where he devoted his time to his ſtudies, and meddled very little
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0613800301:224"/>
with public affairs: yet did he not entirely abandon buſineſs, much leſs diſcover any pique or diſreſpect towards the royal family, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what he had ſuffered; but behaved with ſo much temper and duty, that without betraying or even diſſembling his principles, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the favour of king James II. ſo that it is generally believed he would very ſpeedily have been declared lord chancellor of England, if this had not been prevented by his death, which happened April the 6th, 1686, at his houſe in Drury-lane, without any long ſickneſs, by a quinſy, in the ſeventy-third year of his age. He left behind him a numerous poſterity. It is not eaſy to ſay any thing worthy of ſo great a man's character, and yet ſomething is neceſſary to complete the deſign of this life, and to give the reader ſome idea of his mind, as well as his fortune. As he had an excellent and univerſal education, becoming the heir of a noble family, ſo he was always remarkably prone to learning, and to the encouragement of learned men. He was well read in the Claſſics, and perfectly verſed not only in the Greek and Roman hiſtory, but in the ſpirit and policy of theſe famous nations. His intercourſe, however, with foreign wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, did not hinder him from retaining a ſuperior paſſion for all the branches of learning, which had any reſpect to his own country. He had ſtudied the laws with ſuch diligence, as to be ſtyled and eſteemed a lawyer, even by the moſt conceited lawyers of his time. In hiſtory he was a very great critic; and with reſpect to records, and whatever elſe fell under the conſideration of a judicious antiquary, no man of his time deſerved greater reputation than he: he was alſo well verſed in the civil and canon law, underſtood ehurch hiſtory perfectly, and was a great divine. His writings which are extant, will fully ſupport all that has been hitherto ſaid; and the world would have had ſtill higher proofs of his lordſhip's great learning and abilities, if the largeſt and moſt valuable of all his works had not been unluckily loſt, or, as ſome ſay, injuriouſly deſtroyed. However, as Anthony Wood, who never ſpeaks well of this nobleman, but againſt his will, allows that he had a ſmooth, ſharp, and keen pen, we preſume that nobody will doubt it. As to the aſperſions thrown on his memory, by a reverend prelate his contemporary, they would have deſerved a more particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if it had been uſual for that writer to have given good characters of his acquaintance, or to have avoided characterizing ſuch as he had little or no acquaintance with. We will conclude our account of this noble perſon, with obſerving, that he was one of the firſt Engliſh peers who diſtinguiſhed himſelf by collecting a fine library, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with great care, as well as at a large expence; and as he was deſirous that ſo valuable a collection might not quickly be diſſipated,

but remain in his family, he cauſed it to be diſpoſed in a manner ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its worth, in a particular apartment in Angleſey houſe. But theſe precautions proved fruitleſs, as his lordſhip's good intentions likewiſe did; his books within a few months after his deceaſe being expoſed to public ſale by Mr. Millington, a famous auctioneer. Yet this ſale was attended with an accident, which will hinder its being ever forgotten.

            <p>ARCHBISHOP of Canterbury in the reign of William Rufus and Henry I. was an Italian by birth, being born in the year 1033, at Aoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0613800301:226"/>
a town at the foot of the Alps, belonging to the Duke of Savoy. He was deſcended of a conſiderable family: his father's name was Gundul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, and his mother's Hemeberga. After he had gone through a courſe of ſtudies, and travelled for ſome time in Burgundy and France, he took the monaſtic habit in the abbey of Becc, in Normandy, of which Lanfranc, afterwards archbiſhop of Canterbury, was then prior. At that time Anſelm was no more than 27 years of age. Three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when Lanfranc was made abbot of Caen, Anſelm ſucceeded him in the priory of Becc; and when Herluin, abbot of that monaſtery, died, Anſelm was promoted to the abbacy. About the year 1092, Anſelm came over into England, being invited thither by Hugh Earl of Cheſter, who requeſted his aſſiſtance in his ſickneſs. Soon after his arrival, William Rufus, falling ſick at Glouceſter, and being preſſed to fill up the ſee of Canterbury, which had been vacant above four years, thought fit to nominate Anſelm; who with much difficulty was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to accept that dignity. Before his conſecration, he gained a promiſe from the king for the reſtitution of all the lands, which were in the poſſeſſion of that ſee in Lanfranc's time. And thus having ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the temporalities of the archbiſhopric, and done homage to the king, he was conſecrated with great ſolemnity on the 4th of December, 1093. Soon after his conſecration, the king intending to wreſt the duchy of Normandy from his brother Robert, endeavouring to raiſe what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he could for that purpoſe, Anſelm made him an offer of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; which the king thinking too little, refuſed to accept, and the archbiſhop thereby fell under the king's diſpleaſure. About that time he had a diſpute with the biſhop of London, touching the right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating churches in a foreign dioceſe. The next year the king being ready to embark for Normandy, Anſelm waited upon him, and deſired his leave to convene a national ſynod, in which the diſorders of the church and ſtate, and the general diſſolution of manners, might be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died: but the king refuſed his requeſt, and even treated him very roughly; upon which the archbiſhop and his retinue withdrew from court. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of diſcontent between the king and the archbiſhop, was, Anſelm's deſiring leave to go to Rome, to receive the pall from pope Urban II. whom the king of England did not acknowledge as pope, being more inclined to favour the party of his competitor Guibert. This miſunderſtanding occaſioned great diſputes; and to put an end to the controverſy, a council or convention was held at Rockingham caſtle; the iſſue of which was, that the majority of the biſhops, being either gained or overawed by the court, threw up their canonical obedience, and renounced Anſelm for their archbiſhop. In conſequence of this proceeding Anſelm deſired a paſſport, to go beyond the ſea, till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0613800301:227"/>
miſunderſtandings could be made up. But the king abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed his requeſt, and would only conſent, that there ſhould be a kind of truce or ſuſpenſion of the affair from March to Whitſuntide, during which interval the difference was to ſleep. But before the expiration of this term, the king broke through the agreement, baniſhed ſeveral cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen who were Anſelm's favourites, and miſerably haraſſed the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of his ſee. Whitſuntide being come, and the biſhops having in vain endeavoured to ſoften Anſelm into a compliance; the king, with the advice of his great men, received him into favour, upon his own terms; and becauſe Anſelm perſiſted in refuſing to receive the pall from the king's hands, it was at laſt agreed, that the pope's nuncio, who had brought the pall into England, ſhould carry it down to Canterbury, and lay it upon the altar of the cathedral; from whence Anſelm was to receive it, as if it had been put into his hands by St. Peter himſelf. Things being thus adjuſted, the archbiſhop went to Canterbury, and received the pall with great ſolemnity, the June following. And now it was generally hoped, that all occaſion of difference between the king and the archbiſhop was removed: but it appeared ſoon after, that the reconciliation on the king's part was not ſincere. For William having marched his forces into Wales, and brought that country to ſubmiſſion, took that opportunity to quarrel with Anſelm, pretending he was not ſatisfied with the quota the archbiſhop had furniſhed for that expedition. Finding therefore his authority too weak to oppoſe the corruptions of the times, he reſolved to go in perſon to Rome, and conſult the pope. But the king, to whom he applied for leave to go out of the kingdom, ſeemed ſurpriſed at the requeſt, and gave him a flat denial. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this the archbiſhop reſolved upon the voyage, and accordingly embarked at Dover. But when the king heard that he had croſſed the Channel, he ſeized upon the archbiſhopric, and made every thing void which Anſelm had done. The archbiſhop got ſafe to Rome, and was honourably received by the pope. After a ſhort ſtay in that city, he accompanied the pope to a country ſeat near Capua, whither his holineſs retired on account of the unhealthineſs of the town. And here Anſelm wrote a book, in which he gave an account of the reaſon of our Saviour's Incarnation. The Pope wrote to the King of England in a ſtrain of authority, enjoining him to reinſtate Anſelm in all the profits and privileges of his ſee. Anſelm likewiſe wrote into England upon the ſame ſubject. As for the king, he endeavoured to get Anſelm diſcountenanced abroad, and wrote to Roger Duke of Apulia, and others, to that purpoſe. But he had not credit enough it ſeems, to gain his point: for Anſelm was treated with all imaginable reſpect wherever he came. This famous archbiſhop was very ſerviceable to the pope in

               </gap>ſter. And, the better to effect his purpoſe, he tried the intereſt of his purſe; and partly by preſents, and partly by promiſes, he bribed the court of Rome to deſert Anſelm. The archbiſhop, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how matters went, would have returned to Lyons, but the pope would not part with him; and to ſweeten him after his diſappointment, lodged him in a noble palace, where his holineſs made him frequent viſits. About that time the pope having ſummoned a council to fit at Rome, Anſelm had a very honourable ſeat aſſigned him and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; this being the firſt time of an archbiſhop of Canterbury's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Roman ſynod. When the council broke up, Anſelm immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately left Rome, and returned to Lyons, where he was entertained for ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The archbiſhop being arrived in England, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with extraordinary reſpect by the king and the people, and thus for matters went ſmoothly enough. But when it was required of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelm, that he ſhould be re-inveſted by the king, and do the cuſtomary homage of his predeceſſors, he refuſed to comply, alledging the canons of the late ſynod at Rome about inveſtitures.

               </gap>de the pope to diſpenſe with the canons of the late ſynod
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0613800301:229"/>
in relation to inveſtitures. About this time Anſelm ſummoned a ſynod to meet at Lambeth, on occaſion of the king's intended marriage with Maud or Matilda, eldeſt daughter of Malcolm king of Scotland. In this ſynod it was determined, that the king might lawfully marry that princeſs, notwithſtanding ſhe was generally reported to be a nun, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worn the veil, and had her education in a religious houſe. Soon after this marriage, Anſelm was of ſignal ſervice to King Henry againſt his brother the Duke of Normandy, who invaded England, and landed with a formidable army at Portſmouth. For the archbiſhop not only furniſhed the king with a large body of men, but was very active, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in preventing a revolt from him. The agents, ſent by the king and the archbiſhop to Rome, being returned, brought with them a letter from Pope Paſchal to the king, in which his holineſs abſolutely refuſed to diſpenſe with the canons concerning inveſtitures. The king, on his part, reſolved not to give up what for ſome reigns had paſſed for part of the royal prerogative. And thus the difference was kept on foot between the king and Anſelm. In this diſpute the majority of the biſhops and temporal nobility were on the court ſide: and ſome of them were very earneſt with the king, to break entirely with the ſee of Rome. However, it was not thought adviſeable to proceed to an open rupture, without trying a farther expedient; and therefore freſh agents were diſpatched by the king to Rome, with inſtructions to offer the pope this alternative; either to depart from his former declaration, and relax in the point of inveſtitures, or to be content with the baniſhment of Anſelm, and to loſe the obedience of the Engliſh, and the yearly profits accruing from that kingdom. At the ſame time, Anſelm diſpatched two monks, to inform the pope of the menaces of the Engliſh court. But the king's ambaſſadors could not prevail with the pope to recede from his declaration; his holineſs proteſting he would ſooner loſe his life than cancel the decrees of the holy fathers: which reſolution he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by letters to the king and Anſelm. Soon after the king, having convened the great men of the kingdom at London, ſent Anſelm word, that he muſt either comply with the uſages of his father's reign, or quit England. But the agents diſagreeing in their report of the pope's anſwer, Anſelm thought proper not to return a poſitive anſwer, till farther information. And thus the controverſy ſlept for the preſent. The next year a national ſynod was held under Anſelm at St. Peter's, Weſtminſter; at which the king and the principal nobility were preſent. The year following the king was pleaſed to relent, and deſire Anſelm to take a journey to Rome, to try if he could perſuade the pope to relax. Anſelm, at the requeſt of the biſhops and barons, undertook the voyage. At the ſame time, the king diſpatched one William Warelwaſt to Rome.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0613800301:230"/>
This agent, arriving there before Anſelm, ſolicited for the king his maſter, but to no purpoſe; for the pope perſiſted in refuſing to grant the king the right of inveſtiture. But at the ſame time his holineſs, wrote a very ceremonious letter to the king of England, entreating him to wave the conteſt, and promiſing all imaginable compliance in other matters. Anſelm having taken leave of the court of Rome, returned to Lyons, where he received a ſharp and reprimanding letter from a monk, acquainting him with the lamentable condition of the province of Canterbury. During the archbiſhop's ſtay at Lyons, the king ſent another embaſſy to Rome, to try if he could prevail with the pope to being Anſelm to a ſubmiſſion. But the pope, inſtead of being gained, excommunicated ſome of the Engliſh court, who had diſſuaded the king from parting with the inveſtitures. However, his holineſs declined pronouncing any cenſure againſt the king. Anſelm perceiving the court of Rome dilatory in its proceedings, removed from Lyons, and made a viſit to the Counteſs Adela, the Conqueror's daughter, at her caſtle in Blois. This lady inquiring into the buſineſs of Anſelm's jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he told her that, after a great deal of patience and expectation, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſt now be forced to excommunicate the king of England. The counteſs was extremely concerned for her brother, and wrote to the pope to procure an accommodation. The king, who was come into Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, hearing that Anſelm deſigned to excommunicate him, deſired his ſiſter to bring him with her into Normandy, with a promiſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion in ſeveral articles. To this Anſelm agreed, and waited upon the king at a caſtle called L'Aigle, where the king reſtored to him the revenues of the archbiſhopric, but would not permit him to come into England, unleſs he would comply in the affair of the inveſtitures: which Anſelm refuſing to do, continued in France, till the matter was once more laid before the pope. And now the Engliſh biſhops, who had taken part with the court againſt Anſelm, began to change their minds, as appears by their letter to him in Normandy. In this letter, after having ſet forth the deplorable ſtate of the church, they preſs him to come over with all ſpeed, promiſing to ſtand by him, and pay him the regard due to his character: it is ſubſcribed by Gerrard archbiſhop of York, Robert biſhop of Cheſter, Herbert biſhop of Norwich, Ralph biſhop of Chicheſter, Sampſon biſhop of Worceſter, and William elect of Wincheſter. Anſelm expreſſed his ſatisfaction at this conduct of the biſhops, but acquainted them that it was not in his power to return, till he was further informed of the proceedings of the court of Rome. In the mean time, being informed, that the king had fined ſome of the clergy for a late breach of the canons, he wrote to his highneſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of that ſtretch of his prerogative. At length the ambaſſadors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0613800301:231"/>
from Rome, and brought with them a deciſion more agreeable than the former: for now the pope thought fit to make ſome advances towards gratifying the king; and though he would not give up the point of inveſtitures, yet he diſpenſed ſo far as to give the biſhops and abbots leave to do homage for their temporalities. The king, who was highly pleaſed with this condeſcenſion in the pope, ſent immediately to invite Anſelm into England: but the meſſenger finding him ſick, the king himſelf went over into Normandy, and made him a viſit at the abbey of Becc; where all differences between them were perfectly adjuſted. And now Anſelm, being recovered from his ſickneſs, embarked for England, and, landing at Dover, was received with extraordinary marks of welcome. To omit other circumſtances of reſpect, the queen herſelf travelled before him upon the road, to provide for his better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. From this time nothing remarkable happened in the life of this famous archbiſhop, excepting only his conteſt with Thomas elected archbiſhop of York, who endeavoured to diſengage himſelf from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency upon the ſee of Canterbury. Before the termination of this diſpute, Anſelm died at Canterbury, in the ſeventy-ſixth year of his age, and the ſeventeenth of his prelacy, on the twenty-firſt of April, A. D. 1109. This great prelate was author of ſeveral pieces. The largeſt edition of his works is that publiſhed by Father Gerberon. It is divided into three parts. The firſt of theſe containing Dogmatical Tracts, is intitled Monologia. The ſecond part contains practical and devotional tracts. The third part takes in Anſelm's letters, in four books. As to the character of archbiſhop Anſelm, it may be partly collected from the circumſtances of his life above recited. He has been much praiſed for the reſolution he ſhewed in the diſputes he had with William Rufus and Henry I. Where he believed the rights of the church and the intereſt of religion concerned, no greatneſs, no menaces of princes, nor proſpect of danger, could diſcourage him in the purſuit of his point. Malmeſbury tells us, he was a perſon of great ſtrictneſs and ſelf-denial: his temper and ſedateneſs were ſuch, that, after he turned monk, he never was heard to utter the leaſt reproachful word. This archbiſhop was the firſt who reſtrained the Engliſh clergy from marrying.

In the next year, he was again in the Baltic, in the fleet commanded by Sir George Byng; and at this time he had an opportunity, which pleaſed hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

theſe early and ſpeedy promotions, from his connection with the Earl of Macclesfield, then lord chancellor of England, yet it can ſcarcely be ſuppoſed that they could have been ſo quickly attained, in a time of peace, if he had not given peculiar proofs of merit in his profeſſion. Soon after his appointment to the Scarborough, he was ordered in her to South Carolina, in which ſtation he continued for three years; and while he reſided in that province, he erected a town, Anſon Bourgh, and gave name to a county, which is ſtill called Anſon County. After his return from his ſettlement in South Carolina, he always ſpoke with ſatisfaction both of that country and its inhabitants. Being commanded home in October, 1727, he returned to England in the following ſpring, and was paid off in May, 1728. On the 11th of October in the ſame year, Mr. Anſon was appointed captain of the Garland man of war, and went out in her to South Carolina; from whence he was ordered back, in December, 1729, and the ſhip was put out of commiſſion at Sheerneſs. However, having the good fortune to be well with Lord Torringto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and Sir Charles Wager, ſucceſſively firſt lords of the admiralty, he did not remain long out of employ; for on the 19th of May, 1731, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Diamond, one of the Downs ſquadron, was beſtowed upon him: which command he held but about three months, the Diamond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then paid off. On the 25th of January, 1731-2, he was again call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into public ſervice, and appointed captain of the Squirrel man of war; in which ſhip he was ordered, in the following April, for South Carolina. This was the third time of his being placed upon that ſtation, and it was probably peculiarly agreeable to him, on account of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty he had acquired, and the ſettlement he had made in the province. Here he continued till the ſpring of the year 1735, when, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of an order, given in December, 1734, he returned to England; and, in the month of June, was paid off at Woolwich. It appears from ſome original letters of Mr. Anſon to the board of admiralty, with the fight of which we have been favoured, that he conducted himſelf, in theſe ſeveral employments, with an ability and diſcretion which gave general ſatisfaction. After his laſt return from South Carolina, we find that he had ſtaid at home between two and three years; it being the 9th of December, 1737, when he was put into the command of the Centurion. In this ſhip, he was ordered in the February following, to the coaſt of Guinea; from which ſtation he returned to his own country, by way of Barbadoes and South Carolina, on the 10th of July, 1739. It is evident from the journal of the Centurion, during this period, compared with the inſtructions given to Captain Anſon, by the board of admiralty, that he executed, with great prudence and fidelity, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of government; and it is underſtood in the family, that he

               </gap> that coaſt, without coming to any action, at a time when it would have been very inconvenient to the Britiſh court to have had an open rupture with the court of France.</p>
            <p>Mr. Anſon's conduct, in his various ſituations and employments, had produced ſo favourable a character of his capacity and ſpirit, that when, in the war which broke out with Spain in 1739, it was determined to attack the American ſettlements of the Spaniards in the great Pacific ocean, and by this means to affect them in their moſt ſenſible parts, he was from the beginning, fixed upon to be the commander of the fleet, which was deſigned for that purpoſe. As the hiſtory of this expedition, which laid the foundation of his future fortunes, hath in conſequence of the excellent account that has been written of it by the late Mr. Robins, and the curious and intereſting nature of the ſubject, been more read than almoſt any other which hath ever appeared, it is not neceſſary to give a detail of it in the preſent article. It is well known that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from St. Helen's on the 18th of September, 1740, at the head of a ſquadron of five men of war, a ſloop of war, and two victualling ſhips; that he ſtopped firſt at Madeira, then on the coaſt of Braſil, and next at port St. Julian in Patagonia; that they encountered prodigious diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in doubling Cape Horn; that in this perilous paſſage, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his fleet was ſcattered from him, and part of it never joined him again; that, at length, he arrived at the iſland of Juan Fernandes; that from thence he proceeded to Peru, took the town of Paita, anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few days at Quibo, ſailed to the coaſt of Mexico, and formed the deſign of intercepting the Acapulco ſhip; that, after ſtopping a while at the harbour of Chequetan, he determined to croſs the Pacific ocean; that, at laſt, his ſquadron was reduced to his own ſingle ſhip, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, that he made ſome ſtay at Tinian, one of the Ladrones or Marian iſlands, from which he immediately went to Macao; and that ſailing back from Macao, in queſt of the Manilla galleon, he had the good fortune of meeting with it and of taking it, on the 30th of June, 1743; that, after this enterprize, he returned to Canton, from whence he embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to England by the Cape of Good Hope; that, having completed his voyage round the world, he came ſafe to an anchor at Spithead, on the 15th of June, 1744; and that he executed the whole of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with ſingular honour and advantage to himſelf, and the officers and people under him, though, from original errors and defects in the embarkation, and from cauſes in which he was in no wiſe concerned, the grand deſign of the expedition was not fully anſwered. If any of our readers ſhould happen to be unacquainted with theſe tranſactions, they will have recourſe to the account of them at large, that has been publiſhed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0613800301:235"/>
under the name of Mr. Walter; it being only our intention to ſelect ſuch circumſtances as have a more immediate relation to the perſonal character of Mr. Anſon, and which indicate the turn of his mind. As before he ſet ſail upon the expedition, he took care to furniſh himſelf with the printed journals of the voyages to the South Seas, and the beſt manuſcript accounts he could procure of all the Spaniſh ſettlements upon the coaſts of Chili, Peru, and Mexico, which he afterwards care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully compared with the examinations of his priſoners, and the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeveral intelligent perſons, who fell into his hands; ſo, through the whole enterprize, he acted with a remarkable diſcretion, and with a calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which particularly diſtinguiſhes his character. When he was ready to depart from St. Catharine's, and conſidered that his own ſhip might poſſibly be loſt, or diſabled from getting round Cape Horn, he gave ſuch directions to the other commanders, as would have prevented the undertaking's being, even in that caſe, abandoned. His huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was diſplayed at the iſland of Juan Fernandes, in his aſſiſting with his own labour, and obliging the officers, without diſtinction, to give a helping hand, in carrying the ſick ſailors in their hammocks, to ſhore. At the ſame place he ſowed lettuces, carrots, and other garden plants, and ſet, in the woods, a great variety of plumb, apricot and peach-ſtones, for the better accommodation of his countrymen who ſhould hereafter touch there. From a like regard to future na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators, Commodore Anſon was particularly induſtrious in directing the roads and coaſts to be ſurveyed, and other obſervations to be made; for he well knew by his own experience of the want of theſe materials, of how great conſequence they might prove to any Britiſh veſſels, which, in ſucceeding times, might be employed in thoſe ſeas. His integrity and generoſity in the treatment of ſome female priſoners who had fallen into his hands, and his care to prevent their meeting with any degree of rudeneſs, from a ſet of ſailors who had not ſeen a woman for near a twelvemonth, are greatly to his honour. By the wiſe and proper uſe which he made of the intelligence he had obtained from ſome Spaniſh captures, the Commodore was encouraged to form the deſign of attacking the town of Paita; and his conduct in that attack, added much to his reputation. Such was the excellent diſcipline to which he had accuſtomed his men, that, in the taking of the town, only one man was found, who was known to have ſo far neglected his duty as to get drunk. After the attack upon Paita, when a ſpirit of envy and jealouſy aroſe concerning the diſtribution of the plunder, he manifeſted his prudence and equity in allaying this ſpirit, and his liberality in giving up his own ſhare. But there was nothing from which Mr. Anſon derived greater perſonal credit, or which reflected greater
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0613800301:236"/>
glory upon the Engliſh nation, than his behaviour to his priſoners in general, and eſpecially to the women before mentioned. This beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was ſo honourable in itſelf, and ſo beneficent in its conſequences, that it deſerves to be particularly noticed. Though his force was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered weak by the ſickneſs and death of numbers of his men, and by the ſeparation or loſs of the larger part of his ſmall ſquadron, we find that he was always intent upon contriving ſome ſcheme or other, by which, if poſſible, the deſign of his expedition might be anſwered. When no purpoſe was likely to be effectual, but the taking of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulco ſhip, he purſued that plan with the greateſt ſagacity and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. In no inſtance was the fortitude of his mind more tried, than when the Centurion was driven out to ſea, from the uninhabited iſland of Tinian; himſelf, many of the officers, and part of the crew being left on ſhore. Nevertheleſs, in this gloomy and diſconſolate ſituation, he preſerved his uſual compoſure and ſteadineſs, though he could not be without his ſhare of inward diſquietude. He calmly applied to every meaſure which was likely to keep up the courage of his men, and to facilitate their departure from the iſland. He perſonally engaged in the moſt laborious part of the work which was neceſſary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing of a veſſel for this purpoſe; and it was only upon the pleaſing and unexpected news of the return of the Centurion, that, throwing down his axe, he by his joy broke through, for the firſt time, the equable and unvaried character which he had hitherto preſerved. Commodore Anſon, when he was at Macao, exerted great ſpirit and addreſs in procuring the neceſſary aid from the Chineſe, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitting of his ſhip. In the ſcheme of taking the Manilla galleon, and in the actual taking of it, he diſplayed united wiſdom and courage; nor did the accuſtomed calmneſs of his mind forſake him on a moſt trying and critical occaſion; when, in the moment of victory, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion was dangerouſly on fire near the powder-room. During his ſubſequent ſtay at Canton, he acted, in all reſpects, with the greateſt ſpirit, and firmly maintained the privileges and honour of the Britiſh flag. The perils, with which he had ſo often been threatened, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him to the laſt; for on his arrival in England, he found that he had ſailed through the midſt of a French fleet then cruizing in the Channel; from which he had the whole time been concealed by a fog. Thus was his expedition finiſhed, when it had laſted three years and nine months; <q rend="inline">'after having by its event,' ſays the writer of his voyage, 'ſtrongly evinced this important truth, That though prudence, intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and perſeverance united, are not exempted from the blows of adverſe fortune; yet, in a long ſeries of tranſactions, they uſually riſe ſuperior to its power, and in the end rarely fail of proving ſucceſsful.'</q>

               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0613800301:237"/>Mr. Anſon, a few days after his return to his own country, was made a rear admiral of the blue; and in a very ſhort time, he was choſen member of parliament for Heydon in Yorkſhire. On the 27th of December, 1744, when the Duke of Bedford was appointed firſt lord of the admiralty, he was appointed one of the commiſſioners; and on the 23d of April in the following year, he was made a rear admiral of the white. On the 14th of July, 1746, he was raiſed to the rank of vice-admiral. In the latter end of the year 1746, and the beginning of 1747, he commanded the ſquadron in the Channel ſervice; and bore the inconveniences of a long and tempeſtuous win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter navigation, with his uſual perſeverance. Nothing would have fruſtrated the ſucceſs of this expedition, but the accidental intelligence which was given by the maſter of a Dutch veſſel, to the Duke d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's fleet, of Admiral Anſon's ſtation and intention. However, being employed again early in the enſuing ſpring, he had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of rendering a ſignal ſervice to his country. Being then on board the Prince George of 90 guns, with rear admiral Warren, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire, and twelve ſhips more under his command, he intercepted, on the 3d of May, 1747, off Cape Finiſterre, a conſiderable fleet, bound from France to the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, and laden with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, treaſure, and warlike ſtores; and took ſix men of war, and four Eaſt Indiamen, not one of the enemy's ſhips of war eſcaping. By this great and ſucceſsful exploit, he defeated the pernicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of two hoſtile expeditions, made a conſiderable addition to the force and the riches of our own kingdom, and thus converted into a public benefit, the intended means of a public calamity. M. St. George, Captain of the Invincible, in alluſion to the names of the two ſhips which had been taken, and pointing to them at the ſame time, ſaid, when he preſented his ſword to the conqueror; <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, vouz avez vaincu</hi> l'invincible, <hi>et</hi> la gloire <hi>vous ſuit.</hi> On the 13th of June following, his Majeſty king George the ſecond, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. Anſon's eminent ſervices, was pleaſed to raiſe him to the honour of an Engliſh peerage, by the ſtyle and title of Lord Anſon, Baron of Soberton in the county of Southampton; and his Lordſhip made choice of a motto, very happily ſuited to the dangers he had gone through, and the ſucceſſes he had met with, <hi>Nil deſperandum.</hi> On the 25th of April, 1748, he married Elizabeth, eldeſt daughter of Philip Lord Hardwicke, at that time Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, which lady died without iſſue, on the firſt of June, 1760. He had frequently the honour of convoying the late king from England to Holland. The firſt time was in the year 1748; and ever after he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attended his majeſty on his going abroad, and on his return to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0613800301:238"/>
this kingdom. On the 12th of July, 1749, his lordſhip was made vice-admiral of Great Britain, an appointment that is more of a civil than a military nature; but which nevertheleſs, is always given to a military man. On the 12th of June, 1751, he was preferred to be firſt commiſſioner of the admiralty, in the room of the Earl of Sandwich; and in the years 1752 and 1755, he was one of the Lords Juſtices of the kingdom, during his Majeſty's abſence. The ſquadrons fitted out in the laſt mentioned year, on the proſpect of a war with France, were got ready with ſingular diſpatch, the officers ſent to the ports ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting themſelves in a remarkable manner. That more ſucceſs did not attend them was owing to accidents. Mr. Boſcawen commanded one diviſion of the fleet, and Sir Edward Hawke the other; and both theſe gallant admirals always ſerved with credit, often with the moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant ſucceſs. It was the run of the times, inflamed by party writers, to blame Lord Anſon, for not ſending a fleet to relieve Minorca in time, when Port Mahon was beſieged by the Duke of Richlieu; and it was alledged, that when he did ſend one, it was not ſtrong enough. As to his not ſending it ſooner, this was occaſioned in a great meaſure by Mr. Boſcawen's ſquadron (on which we depended for a ſupply of ſeamen) not coming in, by ſeveral weeks, ſo early as was expected. And after that the government was kept in ſuſpenſe, by the alarms of an invaſion, founded on very particular intelligence. With regard to the ſtrength of the fleet, the ableſt ſea-officers (men whoſe judgments no one could diſpute) always thought that the force under Byng was quite ſufficient. It was a match in numbers for the French admiral, and was a ſquadron remarkably well appointed. To this may be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that neither the time of ſending a fleet, nor the ſtrength of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſolely upon the firſt lord of the admiralty, but muſt have had the concurrent opinion of the whole cabinet. On the 16th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1756, Lord Anſon, upon a change in the adminiſtration, reſigned his poſt as firſt commiſſioner of the admiralty. A very accurate inquiry was made, in the next ſeſſion of parliament, into the affair of Minorca; and the miniſtry of that time were, by ſeveral reſolutions of the houſe of commons, acquitted of any blame or neglect of duty. On the 24th of February, 1757, he was made an admiral; and on the 2d of July, he was again placed at the head of the admiralty board, where he continued during the remainder of his life. He came in with his old friends, the Duke of Newcaſtle and the Earl of Hardwicke, and in the moſt honourable manner: for he renewed his ſeat with the concurrence of every individual in the miniſtry, Mr. Pitt reſuming the ſeals as ſecretary of ſtate, and with the particular approbation of king George the Second. All the reſt of his conduct, as firſt commiſſioner of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0613800301:239"/>
admiralty, was crowned with ſucceſs, under the moſt glorious admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration which this country ever ſaw. The laſt time that Lord Anſon commanded at ſea, was in 1758, to cover the expedition againſt the coaſt of France. Being then admiral of the white, and having hoiſted his flag on board the Royal George of 100 guns, he ſailed from Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head on the firſt of June, with a formidable fleet, Sir Edward Hawke ſerving under him; and by continually cruizing before Breſt, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the ſeveral deſcents which were made that ſummer at St. Maloes, Cherburg, &amp;c. The French fleet not venturing to come out, he kept his own ſquadron and ſeamen in conſtant exerciſe; a thing, which he thought, had been too much diſregarded. On the 30th of July, 1761, his lordſhip was raiſed to the dignity of admiral and commander in chief of the fleet; and in a few days he ſailed from Harwich, in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte yacht, to convoy her preſent majeſty to England; whom he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after a rough and tedious paſſage, on the 7th of September. In Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1762, he went to Portſmouth to accompany the Queen's brother, Prince Charles of Mecklenburgh, and to ſhew him the arſenal, and the fleet which was then upon the point of ſailing, under the command of Sir George Pocock, for the Havanna. Lord Anſon, in attending the Prince, caught a violent cold, that was accompanied with a gouty diſorder, under which he languiſhed two or three months. This cold, at length, ſettled upon his lungs, and was the immediate cauſe of his death. He died, at his ſeat at Moorpark, in Hertfordſhire, on the 6th of June, 1762, and was buried in the family vault at Colwich. Beſides the other honours we have mentioned, he was a member of his majeſty's privy council, one of the elder brethren of Trinity-houſe, and a gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the charter-houſe. He was very aſſiduous at the admiralty board, and remarkably quick in making naval diſpoſitions of every kind, and in appropriating the proper ſtrength and proper ſort of ſhips to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſervices. He liked to ſee his table filled with the gentlemen of the navy; and many eminent and valuable men of that profeſſion frequently met there. Among the various ſervices which will render the name of Anſon illuſtrious, his diſcreet and ſucceſsful choice of officers deſerves particularly to be mentioned; as will be allowed by all who recollect, that ſome of the moſt diſtinguiſhed, as Sir Charles Saunders, Captain Saumarez, Sir Percy Brett, Admiral Keppel, Sir Peter Denis, Admiral Campbell, and others, were either his lieutenants in the Centurion, or ſerved under him on different occaſions. He may, in general, be ſaid to have been a true friend and patron to men of real merit and capacity in the ſervice.

by a fooliſh attachment to gaming; that, having ſeen little of the polite world, he eaſily became the dupe of ſharpers in high life, who eaſed him of a conſiderable ſhare of his wealth: and that the ridicule he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred upon theſe occaſions, it is thought, affected his ſpirits, and contributed not a little, to bring on that decline which ſhortened his days.'</q>
But we have the beſt authority for ſaying, that this repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of things is as falſe as it is injurious to his lordſhip's character. Upon the whole, he neither won nor loſt by gaming; and he made it, like hundreds of others, who paſs uncenſured, his amuſement rather than his buſineſs. To affirm, that any ridicule affected his ſpirits, is an abſolutely groundleſs aſſertion. The great regard which was ſhewn him in all the companies he frequented, muſt put his memory above ſuch an aſperſion. Lord Anſon left his whole fortune to his brother, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Anſon, Eſq. who was member of parliament for Litchfield, and with whom he had always lived in the ſtricteſt friendſhip.

            <p>A very learned phyſician and chemiſt in the latter end of the ſixteenth and beginning of the ſeventeenth centuries. His father was an eminent goldſmith in the city of London, and had an employment of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able value in the jewel-office under the reign of Queen Elizabeth. This ſon of his was born April 16, 1550; and having been carefully inſtructed in the firſt rudiments of learning while at home, was, about the year 1569, ſent to the univerſity of Cambridge, where he ſtudied with great diligence and ſucceſs, and ſome time in the year 1574, took the degree of maſter of arts. It appears from his own writings, that he applied himſelf, for many years that he ſtudied in that univerſity, to the theory and practice of chemiſtry, with ſedulous induſtry, and made no ſmall progreſs.

About a month after he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Counter-priſon, and fined in the ſum of five pounds, <hi>propter illicitam Praxin,</hi> that is, for preſcribing phyſic againſt the ſtatutes and privilege of the college; but upon his application to the lord chief juſtice, he was ſet at liberty, which gave ſo great an umbrage to the college, that the preſident and one of the cenſors waited on the chief juſtice, to requeſt his favour in defending and preſerving the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege privileges; upon which Mr. Anthony ſubmitted himſelf, promiſed to pay his fine, and was forbidden practice. But not long after he was accuſed again of practiſing phyſic, and, upon his own confeſſion, was fined five pounds; which fine, on his refuſing to pay it, was increaſed to twenty pounds, and he committed to priſon till he paid it; neither were the college ſatisfied with this, but commenced a ſuit at law againſt him in the name of the Queen, as well as of the college, in which they prevailed, and obtained judgment againſt him; but after ſome time, were prevailed upon by the intreaties of his wife, to remit their ſhare of the penalty, as appears by their warrant to the keeper of the priſon for his diſcharge, dated under the college ſeal the 6th of Auguſt, 1602. After his releaſe he ſeems to have met with conſiderable patrons, who were able to protect him from the authority of the college; and though Dr. Goodal tells us, that this learned ſociety thought him weak and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in phyſic, yet it ſeems there were other learned bodies of another opinion; ſince after all theſe cenſures, and being toſſed about from priſon to priſon, he became doctor of phyſic in our own univerſities. This did not hinder new complaints being brought againſt him, by Dr. Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and another phyſician, who grounded their proceedings chiefly on his giving a certain noſtrum, which he called <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> or potable gold, and which he repreſented to the world, as an univerſal medicine. There were at this time alſo ſeveral things written againſt him, and his manner of practice, inſinuating that he was very inaccurate in his method of philoſophiſing; that the virtues of metals, as to phyſical uſes, were very uncertain; and that the boaſted effects of this medicine were deſtitute of proof. Dr. Anthony, upon this, publiſhed a very learned and modeſt defence of himſelf and his <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> in Latin, written with great decency, much ſkill in chemiſtry, and with an apparent knowledge in the theory and hiſtory of phyſic. This book, which he publiſhed in 1610, was printed at the univerſity preſs of Cambridge, and had a very florid dedication to king James prefixed. He likewiſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0613800301:242"/>
annexed ſuch certificates of cures, under the hands of ſeveral perſons of diſtinction, and ſome too of the faculty, that it very plainly appeared, he did not by any means deſerve to be treated as an ignorant empiric, or a mere pretender to chemiſtry. His book, however, was quickly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and the controverſy about <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> grew ſo warm, that he was obliged to publiſh another apology in the Engliſh language, which was alſo tranſlated into Latin, and is ſtill in great eſteem abroad; yet here at home it was far from anſwering the doctor's expectation, for it did not at all abate the oppoſition formed againſt his practice by the faculty, or allay that bitterneſs with which his opponents treated his argument, and writings. But, conſidered in another light, it proved very advantageous to him; for it procured the general good-will of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary readers, and contributed exceedingly to ſupport and extend his practice, notwithſtanding all the pains taken to decry it. Yet what chiefly contributed to maintain his own reputation, and thereby reflected credit on his medicine, was his unblemiſhed character in private life. For our Dr. Anthony was a man of unaffected piety, untainted probity, of eaſy addreſs, great modeſty, and boundleſs charity; which procured him many friends, and left it not in the power of his enemies to attack any part of his conduct, except that of diſpenſing a medicine, of which they had no opinion. It is not either our inclination, or agreeable to the deſign of this work, to enter deeply into this controverſy; but it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that though much has been ſaid to diſcredit the uſe of gold in medicine, yet ſome very able and ingenious men have written very plauſibly in ſupport of thoſe principles on which Dr. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony's practice was founded. The age in which Dr. Anthony flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was very favourable to his notion, ſince chemiſtry was then full as much admired, though perhaps not ſo well underſtood as at preſent. He had, therefore, a very extenſive and beneficial practice, which enabled him to live hoſpitably at his houſe in Bartholomew-cloſe, and to be very liberal in his alms to the poor. He died on the 26th of May, 1623, in the 74th year of his age, and was buried in the church of St. Bartholomew the great, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>ANTINOUS.</head>
            <p>THIS celebrated youth lived in the reign of Adrian, and has been univerſally celebrated for his unrivalled beauty. And indeed if the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, intaglios, and other remains of antiquity, which were deſigned to perpetuate his memory, may be thought faithfully to repreſent his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, no one can diſpute his claim to external lovelineſs. But Antinous lived in an age when beauty was more dangerous to male than to female youth. The emperor beheld his blooming graces with the eyes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous deſire: and if nature could permit us to ſuppoſe reciprocity in ſuch deteſtable attachments, it would ſeem that the youth returned the affection of his maſter with an equal ardour. The unbridled and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant paſſion of Adrian was as blaſphemous as it was otherwiſe abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; for at the death of this minion, he not only in his own perſon devoted to him that worſhip which was due to God, but cauſed divine honours to be paid him through all the regions of his extenſive empire. It appears from divers authors that attributes of Mercury, of Apollo, and of Bacchus, were aſcribed to him; and that learned antiquarian, Mr. Bowman, in his diſſertation on an intaglio of Antinous under the figure of Mercury, gives us good reaſon to ſuppoſe he was honoured by the Egyptians as their Annubius. The manner of his death is variouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated— ſome authors inſiſting that he offered his life a voluntary ſacrifice for the emperor, upon the abſurd pagan notion that by ſuch means he might prolong the fated date of the friend who was dear to him; others relate, that from the ſame motive he yielded himſelf a ready victim for the completion of certain myſteries of magic in which Adrian was engaged; while a third claſs aſſert, that he drowned himſelf in the Nile, on account of Adrian's long ſtay in Egypt. Be this as it will, the emperor lamented him with tears and anguiſh; deified him; had temples erected to him; appointed prieſts and prophets to officiate in his worſhip, and deliver his ſuppoſed oracles; had the town in which he was reputed to have died, rebuilt and called by his name; and being told that a new ſtar had made its appearance in the heavens, he affirmed it to be the ſoul of this favourite.</p>

            <head>ANTONIDES VANDER GOES (JOHN),</head>
            <p>AN eminent Dutch poet, born at Goes in Zealand, the 3d of April, 1647. His parents were anabaptiſts, people of good character, but of low circumſtances. They went to live at Amſterdam when Antonides was about four years old; and in the ninth year of his age he began his ſtudies, under the direction of Adrian Junius and James Cocceius. Antonides took great pleaſure in reading the Latin poets, and carefully
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0613800301:244"/>
compared them with Grotius, Heinſius, &amp;c. By this means he acquired a taſte for poetry, and enriched his mind with noble ideas. He firſt attempted to tranſlate ſome pieces of Ovid, Horace, and other ancients; and having formed his taſte on theſe excellent models, he at length un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook one of the moſt difficult taſks in poetry, to write a tragedy; this was intitled Trazil, or The Invaſion of China. Antonides how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was ſo modeſt as not to permit it to be publiſhed. Vondel, who was then engaged in a dramatic piece, which was taken alſo from ſome event that happened in China, read Antonides's tragedy, and was ſo well pleaſed with it, that he declared, if the author would not print it, he would take ſome paſſages out of it, and make uſe of them in his own tragedy, which he did accordingly; and it was reckoned much to the honour of Antonides, to have written what might be adopted by ſo great a poet, as Vondel was acknowledged to be, by all good judges. Upon the concluſion of the peace betwixt Great Britain and Holland, in the year 1667, Antonides wrote a piece intitled Bellona aan band, <hi>i. e.</hi> Bellona chained, a very elegant poem, conſiſting of ſeveral hundred verſes. The applauſe with which this piece was received, excited him to try his genius in ſomething more conſiderable: he accordingly wrote an epic poem, which he intitled The River Y. The deſcription of this river, or rather lake, is the ſubject of the poem, which is divided into four books; in the firſt the poet gives a very pompous deſcription of all that is remarkable on that bank of the Y, on which Amſterdam is built. In the ſecond he opens to himſelf a larger field; he begins with the praiſes of navigation, and deſcribes the large fleets which cover the Y, as an immenſe foreſt, and thence go to every part of the world, to bring home whatever may ſatisfy the neceſſity, the luxury, or pride of men. The third book is an ingenious fiction; which ſuppoſes the poet all of a ſudden carried to the bottom of the river Y, where he ſees the deity of the river, with his demi-gods and nymphs, adorning and dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to go to a feaſt, which was to be celebrated at Neptune's court, upon the anniverſary of the marriage of Thetis with Peleus. In the fourth book he deſcribes the other bank of the Y, adorned with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral cities of North Holland; and in the cloſe of the work addreſſes himſelf to the magiſtrates of Amſterdam, to whoſe wiſdom he aſcribes the riches and flouriſhing condition of that powerful city.</p>
            <p>Antonides's parents had bred him up an apothecary; but his remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able genius for poetry ſoon gained him the eſteem and friendſhip of ſeveral perſons of diſtinction, and particularly of Mr. Buiſero, one of the lords of the admiralty at Amſterdam, and a great lover of poetry who ſent him at his expence to purſue his ſtudies at Leyden, where h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

gave him a place in the admiralty. In the year 1678, Antonides mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Suſanna Bermans, a miniſter's daughter, who had alſo a talent for poetry. His marriage was celebrated by ſeveral eminent poets, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the celebrated Peter Francius, profeſſor of eloquence, who compoſed ſome Latin verſes on the occaſion. Antonides, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his heroic poem, promiſed the life of the apoſtle Paul, which, like Virgil's Aeneid, was to be divided into twelve books; but he never finiſhed that deſign, for only a few fragments of it have appeared, and the reaſon he gave for not bringing it to a concluſion, was, that he durſt not meddle with theological ſubjects, being perſuaded, whatever mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he ſhould obſerve, he muſt diſpleaſe ſome party. After mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he did not much indulge his poetic genius; and within a few years he fell into a conſumption, of which he died on the 18th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1684, being then but thirty-ſeven years and a few months old. He is eſteemed the moſt eminent Dutch poet, after Vondel, whom he ſtudied to imitate, and is thought to have excelled in ſweetneſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and ſmoothneſs of ſtyle; but in accuracy and loftineſs he is greatly inferior to his original. His works have been printed ſeveral times, having been collected by his father, Anthony Tanſz. The laſt edition was printed by Nicholas Ten Hoom, at Amſterdam, in the year 1714, in quarto, under the direction of David Van Hoogſtraaten, one of the maſters of the Latin ſchool of that city, who added to it alſo the life of the poet.</p>

            <head>ANTONINUS PHILOSOPHUS (MARCUS AURELIUS),</head>
            <p>THE Roman emperor, born at Rome, the 26th of April, in the 121ſt year of the Chriſtian aera. He was called by ſeveral names, till he was admitted into the Aurelian family, when he took the name of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Hadrian, upon the death of Cejonius Commodus, turned his eyes upon Marcus Aurelius, but as he was not then eighteen years of age, and conſequently too young for ſo important a ſtation, he fixed upon Antoninus Pius, whom he adopted, upon condition that he ſhould likewiſe adopt Marcus Aurelius. The year after this adoption, Hadrian appointed him queſtor, though he had not yet attained the age preſcribed by the laws. After the death of Hadrian, Aurelius married Fauſtina, the daughter of Antoninus Pius, by whom he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral children. In the year 139, he was inveſted with new honours by the emperor Pius, in which he behaved in ſuch a manner, as endeared him to that prince, and the whole people.</p>
            <p>Upon the death of Pius, which happened in the year 161, he was obliged by the ſenate to take upon him the government, in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which he took Lucius Verus as his colleague. Dion Caſſius
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0613800301:246"/>
ſays, that the reaſon of doing this, was that he might have leiſure to purſue his ſtudies, and on account of his ill ſtate of health; Lucius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſtrong vigorous conſtitution, and conſequently more fit for the fatigues of war. The ſame day he took upon him the name of Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus, which he gave likewiſe to Verus his colleague, and betrothed his daughter Lucilla to him. The two emperors went afterwards to the camp, where, after having performed the funeral rites of Pius, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced each of them a panegyric to his memory. They diſcharged the government in a very amicable manner. It is ſaid, that ſoon after Antoninus had performed the apotheoſis of Pius, petitions were preſented to him by the pagan prieſts, philoſophers and governors of provinces, in order to excite him to perſecute the Chriſtians, which he rejected with indignation; and interpoſed his authority to their protection, by writing a letter to the common aſſembly of Aſia, then held at Epheſus. The happineſs which the empire began to enjoy under the two emperors, was interrupted in the year 162, by a dreadful inundation of the Tiber, which deſtroyed a vaſt number of cattle, and occaſioned a famine at Rome. This calamity was followed by the Parthian war; and at the ſame time the Catti ravaged Germany and Rhaetia. Lucius Verus went in perſon to oppoſe the Parthians, and Antoninus continued at Rome, where his preſence was neceſſary.</p>
            <p>During this war with the Parthians, about the year 163 or 164, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus ſent his daughter Lucilla to Verus, ſhe having been betrothed to him in marriage, and attended her as far as Brunduſium; he intended to have conducted her to Syria; but it having been inſinuated by ſome perſons, that his deſign of going into the eaſt, was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the honour of having finiſhed the Parthian war, he returned to Rome. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans having gained a victory over the Parthians, who were obliged to abandon Meſopotamia, the two emperors triumphed over them at Rome, in the year 166, and were honoured with the title of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their Country. This year was fatal, on account of a terrible peſtilence which ſpread itſelf over the whole world, and a famine under which Rome laboured; it was likewiſe in this year that the Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni, and many other people of Germany, took up arms againſt the Romans; but the two emperors having marched in perſon againſt them, obliged the Germans to ſue for peace. The war, however, was renewed the year following, and the two emperors marched again in perſon; but Lucius Verus was ſeized with an apoplectic fit, and died at Altinum.</p>
            <p>In the year 170, Antoninus made vaſt preparations againſt the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and carried on the war with great vigour. During this war, in 174, a very extraordinary event is ſaid to have happened, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dion Caſſius, was as follows: Antoninus's army being block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0613800301:247"/>
up by the Quadi, in a very diſadvantageous place, where there was no poſſibility of procuring water; in this ſituation, being worn out with fatigue and wounds, oppreſſed with heat and thirſt, and incapable of retiring or engaging the enemy, in an inſtant the ſky was covered with clouds, and there fell a vaſt quantity of rain: the Roman army were about to quench their thirſt, when the enemy came upon them with ſuch fury, that they certainly muſt have been defeated, had it not been for a ſhower of hail, accompanied with a ſtorm of thunder and lightning, which fell upon the enemy, without the leaſt annoyance to the Romans, who by this means gained the victory. In 175, Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus made a treaty with ſeveral nations of Germany. Soon after, Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Caſſius, governor of Syria, revolted from the emperor: this inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, however, was put an end to by the death of Caſſius, who was killed by a centurion named Anthony. Antoninus behaved with great lenity towards thoſe who had been engaged in Caſſius's party: he would not put to death, nor impriſon, nor even ſit in judgment himſelf upon any of the ſenators engaged in this revolt; but he referred them to the ſenate, fixing a day for their appearance, as if it had been only a civil affair. He wrote alſo to the ſenate, deſiring them to act with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence rather than ſeverity; not to ſhed the blood of any ſenator or perſon of quality, or of any other perſon whatſoever, but to allow this honour to his reign, that even under the misfortune of a rebellion, none had loſt their lives, except in the firſt heat of the tumult: "And I wiſh (ſaid he) that I could even recall to life many of thoſe who have been killed; for revenge in a prince hardly ever pleaſes, for even when juſt, it is conſidered too ſevere." In 176, Antoninus viſited Syria and Egypt: the kings of thoſe countries, and embaſſadors alſo from Parthia, came to viſit him. He ſtayed ſeveral days at Smyrna; and after he had ſettled the affairs of the eaſt, went to Athens, on which city he conferred ſeveral honours, and appointed public profeſſors there. From thence he returned to Rome with his ſon Commodus, whom he choſe conſul for the year following, though he was then but ſixteen years of age, having obtained a diſpenſation for that purpoſe. On the 27th of September, the ſame year, he gave him the title of Imperator; and on the 23d of December, he entered Rome in triumph, with Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, on account of the victories gained over the Germans. Dion Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius tells us, that he remitted all the debts which were due to himſelf and the public treaſury during forty-ſix years, from the time that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian had granted the ſame favour, and burnt all the writings relating to thoſe debts. He applied himſelf likewiſe to correct many enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and introduced ſeveral excellent regulations. In the year 178, he left Rome with his ſon Commodus, in order to go againſt the Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0613800301:248"/>
and other barbarous nations; and the year following gained a conſiderable victory over them, and would, in all probability, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſubdued them in a very ſhort time, had he not been taken with an illneſs, which carried him off on the 17th of March, 180, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, and nineteenth of his reign. The whole empire regretted the loſs of ſo valuable a prince, and paid the greateſt regard to his memory: he was ranked amongſt the gods, and every perſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt had a ſtatue of him in their houſes. His book of Meditations has been much admired by the beſt judges. It is wrote in Greek, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of twelve books: there have been ſeveral editions of it in Greek and Latin. "Of all books (ſays the learned Meric Caſaubon, in his preface to the ſecond edition of his tranſlation of this work into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,) that have ever been written by any heathen, I know not any, which either in regard of itſelf (for the bulk thereof) or in regard of the author, deſerves more reſpect than this of Marcus Antoninus. The chiefeſt ſubject of the book is the vanity of the world, and all worldly things, as wealth and honour, life, &amp;c. and the end and ſcope of it, to teach a man how to ſubmit himſelf wholly to God's providence, and to live content and thankful in what eſtate or calling ſoever. In the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, two main things I conceive very conſiderable; firſt, that he was a very great man, one that had good experience of what he ſpake: and ſecondly, that he was a very good man; one that had lived as he did write, and exactly (as far as was poſſible to a natural man) perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he exhorted others to. Be it therefore ſpoken to the immortal praiſe and commendation of Antoninus, that as he did write, ſo he did live. Never did writings ſo conſpire to give all poſſible teſtimony of goodneſs, uprightneſs, innocency, and whatever could, amongſt heathens, be moſt commendable, as they have done to commend this one: they commend him, not as the beſt prince only, but abſolutely as the beſt man and beſt philoſopher that ever was. And it is his proper commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that being ſo commended, he is commended without exception. If any thing had ever been talked againſt him, the hiſtorians mention it but as a talk; not credited by them, nor by any that ever were of any credit. His Meditations were his actions: his deeds (if you conſider him as a man and a heathen) did agree with his ſentences."</p>

            <p>KNIGHT of the order of St. James, and canon of Seville, did great honour to the Spaniſh nation by his Bibliotheque of their writers. He was born at Seville, in 1617, being the ſon of a gentleman, whom king Philip IV. made preſident of the admiralty eſtabliſhed in that city in 1626. After having gone through a courſe of philoſophy and divinity
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0613800301:249"/>
in his own country, he went to ſtudy law at Salamanca, where he cloſely attended the lectures of Franciſco Ramos del Manzano, afterwards coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor to the king, and preceptor to Charles II. Upon his return to Seville, after he had finiſhed his law-ſtudies at Salamanca, he ſhut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in the royal monaſtery of Benedictines, where he employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſeveral years in writing his Bibliotheca Hiſpanica, having the uſe of the books of Bennet de la Sana, abbot of that monaſtery, and dean of the faculty of divinity at Salamanca. In the year 1659, he was ſent to Rome by king Philip IV. in the character of agent-general from this prince: he had alſo particular commiſſions from the inquiſition of Spain, the viceroys of Naples and Sicily, and the governor of Milan, to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate their affairs at Rome. The cardinal of Arragon procured him from pope Alexander VII. a canonry in the church of Seville, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come whereof he employed in charity and purchaſing of books: he had above thirty thouſand volumes in his library. By this help, joined to a continual labour and indefatigable application, he was at laſt enabled to finiſh his Bibliotheca Hiſpanica, in four volumes, in folio, two of which he publiſhed at Rome, in the year 1672. The work conſiſts of two parts, the one containing the Spaniſh writers who flouriſhed before the fifteenth century, and the other thoſe ſince the end of that century. After the publication of theſe two volumes, he was recalled to Madrid by king Charles II. to take upon him the office of counſellor to the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade, which he diſcharged with great integrity till his death, which happened in 1684. He left nothing at his death but his vaſt library, which he had brought from Rome to Madrid; and his two brothers and nephews, being unable to publiſh the remaining volumes of his Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca, ſent them to cardinal d'Aguiſne, who paid the charge of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and committed the care thereof to Monſieur Marti, his librarian, who added notes to them in the name of the cardinal. Antonio had been alſo engaged in a work, intitled Trophaeum hiſtorico-eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Deo veritati erectum ex manubiis pſeudo hiſtoricorum, qui, &amp;c. He had projected ſeveral other works in his mind, but we muſt not omit that which he publiſhed at Antwerp in 1659, De Exilio, ſive de poena exilii, exiliumque conditione et juribus, in folio.</p>

            <head>ANTONIUS (MARCUS),</head>
            <p>A FAMOUS Roman orator. At his firſt entrance into the ſervice of the commonwealth, he gave a remarkable proof of his ſpirit and good ſenſe, which deſerves to be mentioned: he had obtained the queſtorſhip of the province of Aſia, and had gone as far as Brundu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium to embark, in order to take upon him his office, when his friends ſent him word that he was accuſed of inceſt, and that his cauſe was to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0613800301:250"/>
be heard before Caſſius the pretor, a judge of ſuch ſeverity, that his tribunal was ſaid to be the rock of the accuſed. Antonius might have taken the advantage of the law, which forbids any accuſation to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt thoſe who were abſent on the public ſervice; but he choſe rather to juſtify himſelf in form, and for this purpoſe returned to Rome, where he ſtood his trial, and was acquitted with great honour. Sicily fell to his lot during his pretorſhip, and he cleared the ſeas of the pirates which infeſted the coaſt. He was made conſul with A. Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius Albinus, in the year of Rome 653, when he oppoſed the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſigns of Sextus Titus, tribune of the people, with great reſolution and ſucceſs. Some time after, he was made governor of Cilicia, in quality of proconſul, where he performed ſo many great exploits, that he obtained the honour of a triumph. We cannot omit obſerving, that in order to improve his great talent for eloquence, he became a ſcholar to the greateſt men at Rhodes and Athens, in his way to Cilicia, and when on his return to Rome. Soon after he was appointed cenſor, which office he diſcharged with great reputation, having carried his cauſe before the people, againſt Marcus Duronius, who had preferred an accuſation of bribery againſt him, in revenge for Antonius's having erazed his name out of the liſt of ſenators, which this wiſe cenſor had done, becauſe Duronius, when tribune of the people, had abrogated a law, which reſtrained immoderate expence in feaſts. He was one of the greateſt orators ever known at Rome; and it was owing to him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the teſtimony of Cicero, that Rome might boaſt herſelf a rival even to Greece itſelf in the art of eloquence. He defended, amongſt many others, Marcus Aquilius, and moved the judges in ſo ſenſible a manner, by the tears he ſhed and the ſcars he ſhewed upon the breaſt of his client, that he carried his cauſe. Cicero has given us the character of his eloquence, and of his action. He never would publiſh any of his pleadings, that he might not, as he ſaid, be proved to ſay in one cauſe, what might be contrary to what he ſhould advance in another. He affected to be a man of no learning. His modeſty, and many other qualifications, rendered him no leſs dear to many perſons of diſtinction, than his eloquence made him univerſally admired. He was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately killed, during the fatal diſturbances raiſed by Marius and Cinna: it was diſcovered where he had concealed himſelf, and ſoldiers were immediately ſent to diſpatch him. He ſpoke to them in ſuch a manner that they were greatly affected, and there was none but the commander himſelf who had the cruelty to kill him, and he had not heard his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but had juſt entered into the room, full of indignation that his ſoldiers had not executed his orders. This happened in the year of Rome 667.</p>

            <head>APELLES.</head>
            <p>ONE of the moſt celebrated painters of antiquity. He was born in the iſle of Cos, and flouriſhed in the time of Alexander the Great. He was in high favour with this prince, who made a law that no other perſon ſhould draw his picture but Apelles: he accordingly drew him holding a thunderbolt in his hand; the piece was finiſhed with ſo much ſkill and dexterity, that it uſed to be ſaid there were two Alexanders, one invincible, the ſon of Philip, the other inimitable, the production of Apelles. Alexander gave him likewiſe another remarkable proof of his regard, for when he employed Apelles do draw Campaſpe, one of his miſtreſſes, having found that he had conceived an affection for her, he reſigned her to him; and it was from her that Apelles is ſaid to have drawn his Venus Anadyomene. This prince went often to ſee Apelles when at work, and one day, when he was overlooking him, we are told that he talked ſo abſurdly in regard to painting, that Apelles deſired him to hold his tongue, telling him, that the very boys who mixed the colours laughed at him. Mr. Freinſhemius, however, thinks it incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that Apelles would make uſe of ſuch an expreſſion to Alexander; or that the latter, who had ſo good an education, and ſo fine a genius, would talk ſo impertinently of painting: nor is it likely, perhaps, that Apelles would have expreſſed himſelf to this prince in the manner which he is reported to have done, upon another occaſion. Alexander, as we are told, having ſeen his picture drawn by Apelles, did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it ſo much as it deſerved; a little after, a horſe happened to be brought, which neighed at ſight of the horſe painted in the ſame picture: upon this Apelles is ſaid to have told Alexander, "Sir, it is plain this horſe underſtands painting better than your majeſty."</p>
            <p>One of Apelles's chief excellencies was his making his pictures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly reſemble the perſons repreſented, inſomuch that the phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts are ſaid to have been able to form a judgment as readily from his portraits as if they had ſeen the originals. His readineſs and dexterity at taking a likeneſs was of great ſervice to him, in extricating him from a difficulty in which he was involved at the court of Egypt: he had not the good fortune to be in favour with Ptolemy; a ſtorm forced him, however, to take ſhelter at Alexandria, during the reign of this prince: a miſchievous fellow, in order to do him an injury, went to him, and in the king's name invited him to dinner. Apelles went, and ſeeing the king in a prodigious paſſion, told him, by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that he ſhould not have come to his table but by his orders. He was commanded to ſhew the man who had invited him; this was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, the perſon who had put the trick upon him not being preſent:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0613800301:252"/>
Apelles, however, drew a ſketch of his picture on the wall with a coal, the firſt lines of which diſcovered him immediately to Ptolemy.</p>
            <p>Apelles left many excellent pictures, which are mentioned with great honour by the ancients; but his Venus Anadyomene is reckoned his maſter-piece. His Antigonus has alſo been much celebrated; this was drawn with a ſide-face to hide the deformity of Antigonus, who had loſt an eye. His picture of Calumny has alſo been much taken notice of.</p>

            <head>APOLLONIUS RHODIUS,</head>
            <p>A GREEK writer, born in Alexandria, under the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes, king of Egypt. He was a ſcholar of Callimachus, whom he is accuſed of having treated with ingratitude, whereby he drew upon himſelf the indignation of this poet, who gave him the name of Ibis, from a bird of Egypt, which uſed to purge itſelf with its bill. Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius wrote a poem upon the expedition of the Golden Fleece; the work is ſtyled Argonautica, and conſiſts of four books. Quintilian, in his Inſtitutiones Oratoriae, ſays that this performance is wrote "aequali quadam mediocritate:" that the author obſerved an exact medium between the ſublime and low ſtyle in writing. Longinus ſays alſo that Apollonius never ſinks in his poem, but has kept it up in an uniform and equal manner: however, that he falls infinitely ſhort of Homer, notwithſtanding the faults of the latter; becauſe the ſublime, though ſubject to irregularities, is always preferable to every other kind of writing. Gyraldus, ſpeaking of this poem, commends it as a work of great variety and labour; but ſays, however, that the ſtyle and manner of it are harſh in ſome places, though quite otherwiſe where this poet deſcribes the paſſion of Medea. This he painted in ſuch a manner, that Virgil himſelf was ſo pleaſed with it, that he made no ſcruple to copy it almoſt entirely in the ſtory of Dido and Aeneas.</p>
            <p>Apollonius not meeting at firſt with that encouragement which he expected at Alexandria, removed to Rhodes, where he ſet up a ſchool for rhetoric, and gave lectures for a conſiderable time, thence he got the name of Rhodius. Here it was that he corrected and put the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing hand to his Argonautics, which being publicly recited, met with univerſal applauſe, and the author was complimented with the freedom of the city. He is ſaid to have written a book concerning Archilochus, a treatiſe of the Origin of Alexandria, Cnidos, and other works. He publiſhed his poem of the Argonautics at Alexandria, upon his return thither, when ſent for by Ptolemy Euergetes, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed Eratoſthenes as keeper of the public library. It is ſuppoſed that
<pb facs="tcp:0613800301:253"/>
he died in this office, and that he was buried in the ſame tomb with his maſter Callimachus. The ancient ſcholia upon his Argonautics are ſtill extant: they are thought to be written by Tarrhaeus, Theon, and others. Henry Stephens publiſhed an edition of this poem in Greek, in quarto, in 1574, with the Scholia and his own annotations. There was likewiſe an edition publiſhed in Greek and Latin, at Leyden, in 1641, by Jeremy Hoclzlin.</p>

            <head>APOLLONIUS,</head>
            <p>A PYTHAGOREAN philoſopher, born at Tyana in Cappadocia, about the beginning of the firſt century. At ſixteen years of age he became a ſtrict obſerver of Pythagoras's rules, renouncing wine, women, and all ſorts of fleſh; not wearing ſhoes, letting his hair grow, and wearing nothing but linen. He ſoon after ſet up for a reformer of mankind, and choſe his habitation in a temple of Aeſculapius, where he is ſaid to have performed many wonderful cures. Philoſtratus has wrote the Life of Apollonius, in which there are numberleſs fabulous ſtories recounted of him. We are told that he went five years without ſpeaking; and yet during this time, that he ſtopped many ſeditions in Cilicia and Pamphilia: that he travelled, and ſet up for a legiſlator; and that he gave out he underſtood all languages, without having ever learned them; and that he could tell the thoughts of men, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the oracles which birds gave by their ſinging. The heathens were fond of oppoſing the pretended miracles of this man to thoſe of our Saviour: and by a treatiſe which Euſebius wrote againſt one Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles, we find that the drift of the latter, in the treatiſe which Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius refutes, ſeems to have been to draw a parallel betwixt Jeſus Chriſt and Apollonius, in which he gives the preference to this philoſopher.</p>
            <p>Mr. Du Pin has wrote a confutation of Philoſtratus's Life of Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius; in this he proves, 1. That the hiſtory of this philoſopher is deſtitute of ſuch proofs as can be credited. 2. That Philoſtratus has not wrote a hiſtory, but a romance. 3. That the miracles aſcribed to Apollonius carry ſtrong marks of falſehood; and there is not one which may not be imputed to chance or artifice. 4.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0613800301:254"/>
Adrian; and he ſpeaks of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem as of an event which happened in his time. He was born of a good family in Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, from whence he went to Rome, where he diſtinguiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much at the bar, that he was choſen one of the procurators of the emperor, and the government of a province was committed to him. He wrote the Roman hiſtory in a very peculiar method; he did not compile it in a continued ſeries, after the manner of Livy, but wrote diſtinct hiſtories of all the nations that had been conquered by the Romans, and placed every thing relating to thoſe nations in their proper order of time. It was divided into three volumes, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained twenty-four books, or twenty-two according to Charles Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens, Volaterranus, and Sigonius. Photius tells, there were nine books concerning the civil wars, though there are but five now extant. This performance of his has been charged with many errors and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but Photius is of opinion, he wrote with the utmoſt regard to truth, and has ſhewn the greateſt knowledge of military affairs of any of the hiſtorians; for while we read him, we in a manner ſee the battles which he deſcribes. But his chief talent (continues that author) is diſplayed in his orations, in which he moves the paſſions as he thinks proper, either in reviving the reſolution of the ſoldiers, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the impetuoſity of thoſe who are too precipitate. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his work, Appian gives a general deſcription of the Roman empire.

            <head>ARABELLA STUART,</head>
            <p>COMMONLY called the Lady Arabella, ſo often talked of for a Queen, that cuſtom ſeems to have given her a right to an article in this manner under her Chriſtian name, as that by which our hiſtorians diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh her. She was the daughter of Charles Stuart, Earl of Lenox; who was younger brother to Henry Lord Darnley, father to King James VI. of Scotland, and I. of England; by Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Cavendiſh, knt. She was born, as near as can be comput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the year 1577, and educated at London, under the eye of the old Counteſs of Lenox, her grand-mother.

               </gap> beautiful in her perſon, or from being diſtinguiſhed by any extraordinary qualities of mind, and yet ſhe met with many admirers, on account of her royal deſcent, and near relation to the crown of England. Her father dying in the year 1579, and leaving her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0613800301:255"/>
ſole heireſs, as ſome underſtood, of the houſe of Lenox, ſeveral matches were thought of for her at home and abroad. Her couſin, King James, inclined to have married her to Lord Eſme Stuart, whom he had created Duke of Lenox, and whom before his marriage he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as his heir; but this match was prevented by Queen Elizabeth, though it was certainly a very fit one in all reſpects. As the Engliſh ſucceſſion was at this time very problematical, the great powers on the Continent formed many deſigns about it, and thought of many huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands for the Lady Arabella: ſuch as the Duke of Savoy, a prince of the houſe of Farneſe, and others. In the mean time, this lady had ſome thoughts of marrying herſelf at home, as a celebrated writer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, to a ſon of the Earl of Northumberland's; but it is not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that this took effect, though he ſays it did privately. The very attempt procured her Queen Elizabeth's diſpleaſure, who confined her for it. In the mean time her title to the crown, ſuch as it was, became the ſubject, amongſt many others, of father Perſons's famous book, wherein are all the arguments for and againſt her, and which ſerved to divulge her name and deſcent all over Europe; and yet this book was not very favourable to her intereſt. On the death of the queen, ſome malecontents framed an odd deſign of diſturbing the public peace, and amongſt other branches of their dark ſcheme, one was to ſeize the Lady Arabella, and to cover their proceedings by the ſanction of her title, intending alſo to have married her to ſome Engliſh nobleman, the more to increaſe their intereſt, and the better to pleaſe the people. But this conſpiracy was fatal to none but its authors, and thoſe who converſed with them; being ſpeedily defeated, many taken, and ſome executed. As for the Lady Arabella, is does not appear that ſhe had any knowledge of this engagement in her behalf, whatever it was; for domeſtic writers are perplexed, and foreign hiſtorians run into ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities when they endeavour to explain it. She continued at liberty, and in ſome kind of favour at court, though her circumſtances were narrow, till the latter end of the year 1608, when ſome way or other ſhe drew upon her King James's diſpleaſure. However, at Chriſtmas, when there was much mirth and good humour at court, ſhe was again taken into favour, and had a ſervice of plate preſented to her of the value of two hundred pounds, a thouſand merks given her to pay her debts, and ſome addition made to her annual income. This ſeems to have been done, in order to have gained her to the intereſt of the court, and to put the notions of marriage ſhe had entertained out of her head, all which however proved ineffectual; for in the beginning of the month of February, 1609, ſhe was detected in an intrigue with Mr. William Seymour, ſon to Lord Beauchamp, and grandſon
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0613800301:256"/>
to the Earl of Hertford, to whom, notwithſtanding, ſhe was privately married ſome time afterwards. Upon this diſcovery, they were both carried before the council, and ſeverely reprimanded, and then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed. In the ſummer of the year 1610, the marriage broke out, whereupon the Lady was ſent into cloſe cuſtody, at the houſe of Sir Thomas Parry, in Lambeth; and Mr. Seymour was committed to the Tower for his contempt, in marrying a lady of the royal family, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the king's leave. It does not appear that this confinement was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any great ſeverity to either; for the Lady was allowed the uſe of Sir Thomas Parry's houſe and gardens, and the like gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in regard to his high quality, was ſhewn to Mr. Seymour. Some intercourſe they had by letters, was after a time diſcovered, and a reſolution taken thereupon to ſend the Lady to Durham; a reſolution which threw her into deep affliction. Upon this, by the interpoſition of friends, ſhe and her huſband concerted a ſcheme for their eſcape, which was ſucceſsfully executed in the beginning, though it ended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily. The Lady, under the care of Sir James Crofts, was at the houſe of Mr. Conyers, at Highgate, from whence ſhe was to have gone the next day to Durham, on which ſhe put a fair countenance now, notwithſtanding the trouble ſhe had before ſhewn. This made her keepers the more eaſy, and gave her an opportunity of diſguiſing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which ſhe did on Monday the 3d of June, 1611, by drawing over her petticoats a pair of large French-faſhioned hoſe, putting on a man's doublet, a peruke which covered her hair, a hat, a black cloak, ruſſet boots with red tops, and a rapier by her ſide. Thus equipped, ſhe walked out between three and four with Mr. Markham. They went a mile and a half to a little inn, where a perſon attended with their horſes. The Lady, by that time ſhe came thither, was ſo weak and faint, that the hoſtler, who held the ſtirrup when ſhe mounted, ſaid, that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would hardly hold out to London. Riding, however, ſo raiſed her ſpirits, that by the time ſhe came to Blackwall, ſhe was pretty well recovered. There they found waiting for them two men, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, and a chambermaid, with one boat full of Mr. Seymour's and her trunks, and another boat for their perſons, in which they haſted from thence towards Woolwich. Being come ſo far, they bade the watermen row on to Graveſend. There the poor fellows were deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to land, but for a double freight were contented to go on to Lee yet being almoſt tired by the way, they were forced to lie ſtill at Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, whilſt the rowers went on ſhore to refreſh themſelves; then they proceeded to Lee, and by that time the day appeared, and they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a ſhip at anchor a mile beyond them, which was the French bark that waited for them. Here the Lady would have lain at ancho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

expecting Mr. Seymour, but through the importunity of her followers, they forthwith hoiſted ſail and put to ſea. In the mean time Mr. Seymour, with a peruke and beard of black hair, and in a tawney cloth ſuit, walked alone without ſuſpicion, from his lodging, out at the great weſt door of the Tower, following a cart that had brought him billets. From thence he walked along by the Tower-wharf, by the warders of the ſouth gate, and ſo to the iron gate, where one Rodney was ready with a pair of oars to receive him. When they came to Lee, they found that the French ſhip was gone, the billows riſing high, they hired a fiſherman for twenty ſhillings, to put them on board a certain ſhip that they ſaw under ſail. That ſhip they found not to be it they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, ſo they made forwards to the next under ſail, which was a ſhip from Newcaſtle. This, with much ado, they hired for forty pounds, to carry them to Calais, and the maſter performed his bargain, by which means Mr. Seymour eſcaped, and continued in Flanders. On Tueſday in the afternoon, my Lord Treaſurer being advertiſed that the Lady Arabella had made an eſcape, ſent immediately to the lieutenant of the Tower, to ſet ſtrict guard over Mr. Seymour, which he promiſed, after his <hi>yare</hi> manner <hi>he would thoroughly do, that he would</hi>; but coming to the priſoner's lodgings, he found, to his great amazement, that he was gone from thence one whole day before. A pink being diſpatched from the Downs into Calais road, ſeized the French bark, and brought back the Lady and thoſe with her. As ſoon as ſhe was brought to town, ſhe was, after examination, committed to the Tower, declaring that ſhe was not ſo ſorry for her own reſtraint, as ſhe ſhould be glad if Mr. Seymour eſcaped, for whoſe welfare, ſhe affirmed, ſhe was more concerned than for her own. Her aunt, the Counteſs of Shrewſbury, was likewiſe committed, on ſuſpicion of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prompted the Lady Arabella, not only to her eſcape, but to other things, it being known that ſhe had amaſſed upwards of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds in ready money. The Earl of Shrewſbury was confined to his houſe, and the old Earl of Hertford ſent for from his ſeat. By degrees things grew cooler, and though it was known that Mr. Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour continued in the Netherlands, yet the court made no farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the Arch-Duke about him. In the beginning of the year 1612, a new ſtorm began to break out; for the Lady Arabella, either preſſed at an examination, or of her own free will, made ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſcoveries, upon which ſome quick ſteps would have been taken, had it not ſhortly after appeared, that her misfortunes had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her head, and that, conſequently, no uſe could be made of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a perſon out of her ſenſes. However, the Counteſs of Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, who before had leave to attend her huſband in his ſickneſs, was
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0613800301:258"/>
very cloſely ſhut up, and the court was amuſed with abundance of ſtrange ſtories, which wore out by degrees, and the poor Lady Arabella languiſhed in her confinement till the 27th of September, 1615, when her life and ſorrows ended together. Even in her grave this poor lady was not at peace, a report being ſpread that ſhe was poiſoned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe happened to die within two years of Sir Thomas Overbury. As for her huſband, Sir William Seymour, he ſoon after her deceaſe procured leave to return, diſtinguiſhing himſelf by loyally adhering to the king during the civil wars, and, ſurviving to the time of the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, was reſtored to his great-grandfather's title of Duke of Somerſet, by an act of parliament, which entirely cancelled his attainder; and on the giving his royal aſſent to this act, King Charles II. was pleaſed to ſay in full parliament, what perhaps was as honourable for the family as the title to which they are reſtored. His words were theſe: <hi>As this is an act of an extraordinary nature, ſo it is in favour of a perſon of no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary merit: he has deſerved of my father, and of myſelf, as much as any ſubject poſſibly could do; and I hope this will ſtir no man's envy, becauſe in doing it I do no more than what a good maſter ſhould do for ſuch a ſervant.</hi> By his Lady Arabella this noble perſon had no iſſue; but that he ſtill preſerved a warm affection for her memory, appears from hence, that he called one of his daughters by his ſecond wife, Frances, daughter and co-heireſs of Robert Devereux, Earl of Eſſex, Arabella Seymour.</p>

            <head>ARCHILOCHUS,</head>
            <p>A GREEK poet, born in the iſle of Paros. He was the ſon of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſicles, and, according to Mr. Bayle, flouriſhed in the 29th Olympiad. His poetry abounded with the moſt poignant ſatire. His ſatirical vein had ſuch an effect on Lycambes, that he hanged himſelf on account of the ſevere ſatire which Archilochus wrote againſt him. The indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Archilochus againſt Lycambes aroſe from the latter's not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his word: Lycambes had promiſed him his daughter, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards refuſed her to him. It is not unlikely that he attacked the whole family of Lycambes in his lampoon, for it is ſaid that the daughter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the example of her father; and there are ſome who affirm, that three of Lycambes's daughters died of deſpair at the ſame time. In this piece of Archilochus, many adventures are mentioned, full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation, and out of the knowledge of the public. There were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe many looſe indelicate paſſages in the poem; and it is ſaid to have been on account of this ſatire, that the Lacedaemonians laid a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition on his verſes; having conſidered the reading of ſuch looſe pieces as not agreeable to the rules of modeſty. "The Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians (ſays Valerius Maximus) commanded the book of Archilochus to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0613800301:259"/>
be carried out of their city, becauſe they thought the reading of them not to be very modeſt or chaſte: for they were unwilling the minds of their children ſhould be tinctured with them, leſt they ſhould do more harm to their manners than ſervice to their genius. And ſo they baniſhed the verſes of the greateſt, or at leaſt next to the greateſt poet, becauſe he had attacked a family which he hated, with obſcene abuſe." It has been affirmed by ſome, that he himſelf was baniſhed from Lacedaemon; and the maxim that he had inſerted in one of his pieces, is aſſigned for the reaſon thereof, "That it was better to fling down one's arms, than to loſe one's life:" he had written this in vindication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Archilochus was ſo much addicted to raillery and abuſe, he did not even ſpare himſelf. He is ſaid, however, to have been much in favour with Apollo; for when he had been killed in a combat, the oracle of Delphi drove the murderer out of the temple, and was not appeaſed without a multitude of excuſes and prayers; and even after this, the oracle ordered him to a certain houſe, there to pacify the ghoſt of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilochus. This poet excelled chiefly in iambic verſes, and was the inventor of them. He is one of the three poets whom Ariſtarchus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in this kind of poetry. Quintilian puts him, in ſome reſpects, below the other two. Ariſtophanes the grammarian thought, that the longer his iambic poems were, the finer they were: Cicero informs us of this particular; "The longeſt of your epiſtles (ſay he to Atticus) ſeems to me the beſt, as the iambics of Archilochus did to Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes." The hymn which he wrote to Hercules and Iolus, was ſo much eſteemed, that it uſed to be ſung three times to the honour of thoſe who had gained the victory at the Olympic games. There are few of his works extant; and this (ſays Mr. Bayle) is rather a gain than a loſe, with regard to morality. Heraclides compoſed a dialogue upon the life of this poet; which, if it had remained, would in all probability have furniſhed us with many pariculars concerning Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochus.</p>

            <head>ARCHIMEDES,</head>
            <p>A CELEBRATED geometrician, born at Syracuſe, in the iſland of Sicily, and related to Hiero, king of Syracuſe. He was remarkable for his extraordinary application to mathematical ſtudies, in which he uſed to be ſo much engaged, that his ſervants were often obliged to take him from thence by force. He had ſuch a ſurpriſing invention in mechanics, that he affirmed to Hiero, if he had another earth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0613800301:260"/>
to plant his machines, he could move this which we inhabit. He is ſaid to have formed a glaſs ſphere, of a moſt ſurpriſing workmanſhip, wherein the motions of the heavenly bodies were repreſented. He fell upon a curious method to diſcover the deceit which had been practiſed by a workman, employed by king Hiero to make a golden crown. But he became moſt famous by his curious contrivances, whereby the city of Syracuſe was ſo long defended, when beſieged by Marcellus. "The vigorous efforts made to carry the place, had certainly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſooner (ſays Levy) had they not been fruſtrated by one man: this was Archimedes, a man famous for his ſkill in aſtronomy, but more ſo for his ſurpriſing invention of war-like machines, with which in an inſtant he deſtroyed what had coſt the enemy vaſt labour to erect. Againſt the veſſels, which came up cloſe to the walls, he contrived a kind of crow, projected above the wall, with an iron grapple faſtened to a ſtrong chain; this was let down upon the prow of a ſhip, and by means of the weight of a heavy counterpoiſe of lead, raiſed up the the prow, and ſet the veſſel upright upon her poop; then letting it down all of a ſudden, as if the veſſel had fallen from the walls, to the great terror of the ſeamen it ſunk ſo far into the ſea, that it let in a great deal of water, even when it fell directly on its keel." However, notwithſtanding all his art, Syracuſe was at length taken by Marcellus, who commanded his ſoldiers to have a particular regard to the ſafety of Archimedes; but this ingenious man was unfortunately ſlain by a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, who did not know him. "What gave Marcellus the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern (ſays Plutarch) was the unhappy fate of Archimedes, who was at that time in his muſaeum, and his mind, as well as eyes, ſo fixed and intent upon ſome geometrical figures, that he neither heard the noiſe and hurry of the Romans, nor perceived that the city was taken. In this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſtudy and contemplation, a ſoldier came ſuddenly upon him, and commanded him to follow him to Marcellus; which he refuſing to do till he had finiſhed his problem, and fitted it for demonſtration, the ſoldier, in a rage, drew his ſword, and ran him through. Others write that Archimedes ſeeing a ſoldier coming with a drawn ſword to kill him, entreated him to hold his hand one moment, that he might not die with the regret of having left his problem unfiniſhed, and the demonſtration imperfect; but that the ſoldier, without any regard either to his problem or demonſtration, killed him immediately.

ſays he was ſlain by a ſoldier, who did not know who he was, whilſt he was drawing ſchemes in the duſt: that Marcellus was grieved at his death, and took care of his funeral; making his name at the ſame time a protection and honour to thoſe who could claim being related to him. Archimedes is ſaid to have been killed in the 143d Olympiad, and 546th year of Rome, about two hundred and eight years before the birth of Chriſt. We have ſeveral of his works ſtill extent, but the greateſt part of them are loſt.

            <head>ARDEN (EDWARD)</head>
            <p>WAS deſcended of a moſt ancient and honourable family, ſeated at Parkhall, in Warwickſhire. He was born in the year 1532, and his father dying when he was an infant of two years old, he became, before he inherited the eſtate of the family, the ward of Sir George Throkmorton, of Coughton, whoſe daughter Mary he afterwards married. In all probability, it was his engagement with this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and being bred in it, that made him ſo firm a papiſt as he was. However that be, ſucceeding his grandfather, Thomas Arden, Eſq. in 1562, in the family eſtate, he married Mary (Throkmorton) and ſettled in the country, his religion impeding his preferment, and his temper inclining him to a retired life. His being a near neighbour to the great Earl of Leiceſter, occaſioned his having ſome jars with him, who affected to rule all things in that county. Some perſons therein, though of good families, and poſſeſſed of conſiderable eſtates, thought it no diſcredit to wear that nobleman's livery, which Mr. Arden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. In the courſe of this fatal quarrel, exceſſive inſolence on one ſide, produced ſome warm expreſſions on the other; inſomuch that Mr. Arden openly taxed the Earl with his converſing criminally with the Counteſs of Eſſex, in that Earl's life time; and alſo inveighed againſt his pride as a thing the more inexcuſable in a nobleman newly created. Theſe taunts having exaſperated that Miniſter, he projected, or at leaſt forwarded, his deſtruction. Mr. Arden had married one of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to John Somerville, Eſq. a young gentleman of an old family, and good fortune, in the ſame county. This Mr. Somerville was a man of a hot raſh temper, and by many thought a little crazy. He was drawn in a ſtrange manner to plot (if it may be ſo called) againſt the Queen's life; and thus the treaſon is alledged to have been tranſacted. In the Whitſun-Holidays, 1583, he with his wife was at Mr. Arden's, where Hugh Hall, his father-in-law's Prieſt, perſuaded him that Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0613800301:262"/>
being an incorrigible heretic, and growing daily from bad to worſe, it would be doing God and his country good ſervice to take her life away. When the holidays were over, he returned to his own houſe with his wife, where he grew melancholy, and irreſolute. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his wife writes to Hall, her father's Prieſt, to come and ſtrengthen the man. Hall excuſes his coming, but writes at large, to encourage Somerville to proſecute what he had undertaken. This letter had its effects; Somerville ſet out for London, but got no farther than Warwick, where, drawing his ſword and wounding ſome Proteſtants, he was inſtantly ſeized. While he was going to Warwick, his wife went over to her father's, and ſhewed him and her mother Hall's trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable letter, which her father threw into the fire; ſo that only the hearſay of this letter could be alledged againſt him and his wife, by Hall who wrote it, who was tried and condemned with them. But to return to Somerville. On his apprehenſion, he ſaid ſomewhat of his father and mother-in-law, and immediately orders were ſent into War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire for their being ſeized and impriſoned. October 30, 1583, Mr. Somerville was committed to the Tower for high-treaſon. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 4, Hall, the Prieſt, was committed alſo; and on the ſeventh of the ſame month, Mr. Arden. On the ſixteenth, Mary the wife of Mr. Arden, Margaret their daughter, wife to Mr. Somerville, and Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, the ſiſter of Mr. Somerville, were committed. On the twenty-third Mr. Arden was racked in the Tower, and the next day Hugh Hall the Prieſt was tortured likewiſe. By theſe methods ſome kind of evidence being brought out, on the ſixteenth of December Edward Arden, Eſq. and Mary his wife, John Somerville, Eſq. and Hugh Hall the Prieſt, were tried and convicted of high-treaſon at Guildhall, London; chiefly on Hall's confeſſion, who yet received ſentence with the reſt. On the nineteenth of December, Mr. Arden and his ſon-in-law, Somerville, were removed from the Tower to Newgate, for a night's time only: In this ſpace Somerville was ſtrangled by his own hands, as it was given out; but, as the world believed, by ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to get him ſilently out of theirs. The next day, being December 20, 1583, Edward Arden was executed at Smithfield with the general pity of all ſpectators. He died with the ſame high ſpirit he had ſhewn throughout his life. After profeſſing his innocence, he owned himſelf a Papiſt, and one who died for his religion, and want of flexibility, though under colour of conſpiring againſt the State. He ſtrenuouſly inſiſted, that Somerville was murdered, to prevent his ſhaming his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, and having thus extenuated things to ſuch as heard him, he patiently ſubmitted to an ignominious death. His execution was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rigour of the law, his head being ſet (as Somerville's
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0613800301:263"/>
alſo was) upon London bridge, and his quarters upon the city gates; but the body of his ſon-in-law was interred in Moorfields. As for Mrs. Arden, ſhe was pardoned, but the Queen gave the eſtate which fell to her, by her's and her huſband's attainder, to Mr. Darcy. As for Hugh Hall, the Prieſt, he was pardoned too, but Leiceſter doubting his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, would have engaged Chancellor Hatton to have ſent him abroad; which he refuſing, new rumours, little to that proud Earl's honour, flew about. Hollinſhed, Stowe, and ſuch writers, treat Mr. Arden as a traitor fairly convicted, and ſo have others who knew much better; but Camden was too honeſt to write thus, and there is good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to incline our belief, that he died for being a ſtout Engliſhman, rather than a bad ſubject. His ſon and heir Robert Arden, Eſq. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bred in one of the Inns of Court, proved a very wiſe and fortunate perſon, inſomuch that by various ſuits he wrung from Edward Darcy, Eſq. the grantee, moſt of his father's eſtates, and by marrying Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, daughter of Reginald Corbet, Eſq. one of the Juſtices of the King's Bench, he reſtored the credit and ſplendor of this ancient family, and was ſo happy to ſee Henry Arden, Eſq. his eldeſt ſon, knighted by King James, and married to Dorothy, the daughter of Baſil Fielding, of Newnham, Eſq. whoſe ſon became Earl of Denbigh. The drawing this embarraſſed account out of obſcurity, cannot but be grateful to our curious readers, and will anſwer one great end of this work, the elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidating dark paſſages in Engliſh hiſtory, by a compariſon of lights, a thing not to be expected in general collections, or even in the accounts of particular reigns.</p>

He uſed to boaſt,

that his lampoons did more ſervice to the world than ſermons; and it was ſaid of him, that he had ſubjected more princes by his pen, than the greateſt had ever done by their arms. Aretin wrote many irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and obſcene pieces; ſuch are his dialogues, which were called Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionamenti. We have alſo ſix volumes of Letters wrote by him, but they are not in much eſteem: "I have read (ſays Mr. Menage) all Peter Aretin's letters, without finding any thing that I could inſert in any of my books; there is nothing but the ſtyle of them worth regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing," Some ſay that Aretin changed his looſe libertine principles; but however this may be, it is certain that he compoſed ſeveral pieces of devotion: he wrote a Paraphraſe on the penitential Pſalms, and another on Geneſis; he wrote alſo the Life of the Virgin Mary, and that of St. Catherine of Sienna, and of St. Thomas Aquinas. He was author likewiſe of ſome comedies, which were eſteemed pretty good of their kind. He died in the year 1556, being about ſixty-five years old.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid by ſome, that he fell into ſuch a fit of laughter, on hearing ſome ſmutty converſation, that he overturned the chair upon which he ſat, and that in the fall he hurt his head and died upon the ſpot.

            <head>ARIOSTO (LODOVICO, OR LEWIS.</head>
            <p>A CELEBRATED Italian poet, deſcended of a good fumily, and born at the caſtle of Reggio, in Lombardy, in the year 1474. He ſoon gave marks of his great genius, for when very young, he compoſed ſeveral excellent poetical pieces, one of the moſt remarkable of which is the ſtory of Pyramus and Thiſbe, which he formed into a play, and had it acted by his brothers and ſiſters. This performance gained him great applauſe, all who ſaw it preſaging he would prove one of the greateſt poets of the age. His father, however, being a man of no taſte for learning, regarded more what ſtudy would be moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for his ſon to follow, than what ſuited his genius and inclination: he obliged him therefore to apply to the law, which he did for ſome years, though with great reluctance; but upon his father's death, he returned to the more agreeable purſuits of poetry. He was left but in indifferent circumſtances, either becauſe the eſtate was divided amongſt all his brothers, or becauſe his father's income conſiſted chiefly of places of profit, which determined at his death. When Arioſto was
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0613800301:265"/>
about thirty years of age, he was introduced to Hippolito cardinal of Eſt, a great patron of learned men, who entertained him in a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable manner. The ſucceſs which he had hitherto had in the little poetical pieces which he had publiſhed, inſpired him with the ambition of diſtinguiſhing himſelf by ſome nobler work. Sannazarius, Bembo, Nangerius, and Sadolet, had rendered themſelves famous for the beauty of their Latin poems; Arioſto had likewiſe wrote ſome in this language, but finding, as ſir John Harrington obſerves, that he could not raiſe himſelf to the higheſt rank amongſt the Latin poets, which was already poſſeſſed by others, he applied himſelf chiefly to the cultivation of his native tongue, being deſirous to enrich it with ſuch works as would render it valuable and important to other nations. He read Homer and Virgil with critical aſſiduity, and having in view theſe great origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, he began a poem on the loves of Orlando, taking the ſubject from Bojardo's Orlando Inamorato upon whoſe model he proceeded. He began this poem when he was about thirty years of age; it is the moſt celebrated of all his works, though there have been many different opinions concerning it. But his attachment to poetry did not hinder him from engaging in public affairs, for he was employed in embaſſies and negociations in different parts of Italy. The cardinal of Eſt wanted to have carried him to Hungary, with ſome other illuſtrious perſons who attended him, but Arioſto refuſing to go, loſt all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with his patron.</p>
            <p>Upon the death of Hippolito he engaged in the ſervice of Alfonſo, duke of Ferrara, who treated him with great eſteem and affection, and appointed him governor of Graffignana, which office he diſcharged with great honour and ſucceſs. After his return home, he dedicated the reſt of his life to retirement, proſecuting his ſtudies in a houſe which he built for himſelf at Ferrara. He tranſlated ſeveral pieces out of French and Spaniſh into Italian; and wrote alſo ſeveral ſatires, which, according to Mr. Menage, are eſteemed by the beſt judges. There are likewiſe five comedies of his extant, which the duke of Ferrara was ſo pleaſed with, that he erected a magnificent ſtage in the hall of Ferrara, for the repreſentation of them, and made the author ſeveral conſiderable preſents. At his deſire, Arioſto tranſlated the Maenechmi of Plautus into Italian, which was exhibited with great ſucceſs; and all his other comedies were frequently acted by perſons of the firſt quality: and when his Lena was firſt repreſented, Ferdinand of Eſt, afterwards marquis of Maſſa, ſo far honoured the piece, as to ſpeak the prologue. Arioſto uſed to read his verſes to his friends and the ladies of his acquaintance. His manner of reading was excellent; ſo that he thereby gave a peculiar grace to every thing he pronounced.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0613800301:266"/>
He was honoured with the laurel by the emperor Charles V. in the year 1533.</p>
            <p>Arioſto was of an amorous diſpoſition, and left two natural ſons. He was affable, eaſy, and condeſcending in his temper. He enjoyed the friendſhip of the moſt eminent men of learning of his time, moſt of whom he mentions with great reſpect in the laſt canto of his Orlando Furioſo His conſtitution was but weakly, ſo that he was obliged to have recourſe to phyſicians the greateſt part of his life. He bore his laſt ſickneſs with great reſolution ane ſerenity, and died at Ferrara the 8th of July, 1533, according to ſir John Harrington, being then fifty-nine years of age. He was interred in the church of the Benedictine monks, who, contrary to their cuſtom, attended his funeral. He had a buſt erected to him, and an epitaph, written by himſelf, inſcribed upon his tomb. His death was much regreted by all who knew him; and particularly by the men of letters, who honoured his memory by ſeveral Latin and Italian poems.</p>

            <head>ARBUTHNOT (JOHN.)</head>
            <p>AN eminent phyſician, a diſtinguiſhed Wit, and a polite Writer, in the latter end of the ſeventeenth, and the beginning of the preſent century, was deſcended from the noble family of his name in Scotland, and was the ſon of a Clergyman of the Epiſcopal Church in that country. He was born at Arbuthnot, in Kincardinſhire, near Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe, not long after the Reſtoration of King Charles the Second, but in what particular year is uncertain. Having been ſent, at a proper age, to the univerſity of Aberdeen, he applied himſelf diligently to all the academical ſtudies, and particularly to that of phyſic, in which he took his Doctor's degree. The political principles of his father not ſuffering him to comply with the Revolution, he forfeited his Church preferment, and retired for ſupport to a ſmall eſtate of his own. The ſons embraced the ſame political principles; on which account they were laid under a neceſſity of ſeeking their fortunes abroad. The Doctor, however, travelled no farther than to London, where he was entertained at the houſe of Mr. William Pate, a Woollen-draper; ſoon after which, he took up the buſineſs of teaching the mathematics, an undertaking for which he was very well qualified. He was probably engaged in this employment, when Dr. Woodward publiſhed, in 1695, his "Eſſay towards a natural Hiſtory of the Earth." The account
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0613800301:267"/>
which Dr. Woodward, in his Eſſay, gave of the univerſal deluge, appeared to Dr. Arbuthnot to be irreconcileable with juſt philoſophical reaſoning upon mathematical principles; and, therefore, he drew up an anſwer to that part of the work, under the following title: "An Examination of Dr. Woodward's Account of the Deluge, &amp;c. With a Compariſon between Steno's Philoſophy and the Doctor's, in the Caſe of Marine Bodies dug out of the Earth; by J.A. M.D. With a Letter to the Author, concerning <hi>An Abſtract of Agoſtino Scilla's Book</hi> on the ſame ſubject; printed in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, by W. W. F. R. S." This learned piece appeared in 1697, in 8vo. and laid the foundation of Dr. Arbuthnot's literary reputation; which, not long after, received a conſiderable and deſerved increaſe by his "Eſſay on the Uſefulneſs of Mathematical Learning:" In a Letter from a "Gentleman in the city to his Friend at Oxford." In the mean time, as phyſic was his profeſſion, ſo the practice of it was what he principally had in view. At firſt, indeed, as is uſual with regard to young phyſicians, he met with no great encouragement; but, after a while, his buſineſs ſo increaſed to produce a competency; and, by degrees, his ſkill in it, joined with his pleaſing wit and extenſive literature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced him into good eſteem and favour with the polite part of the world. On St Andrew's day, 1704, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society; and on the 30th of October, in the following year, he was ſworn Phyſician Extraordinary to Queen Anne, by her Majeſty's eſpecial command. This honour was conferred upon him, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his ſucceſsful ſervices to his Royal Highneſs Prince George of Denmark. That prince being taken ſuddenly ill at Epſom, was recommended to Dr. Arbuthnot, who happened to be upon the ſpot; and his Highneſs recovering by the Doctor's aſſiſtance, ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employed him as his Phyſician. Upon the indiſpoſition of Dr. Hannes, he was appointed, in November 1709, fourth Phyſician in Ordinary to the Queen; and, on the 27th of April 1710, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Fellow of the College of Phyſicians. About this time, or a little after, Dr. Arbuthnot formed an intimate connection with the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated triumvirate, Swift, Pope, and Gay; and it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he added a new luſtre to that conſtellation of wits by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own. Early in the year 1714, he engaged with Mr. Pope and Dr. Swift in a deſign of writing a ſatire on the abuſes of human learning in every branch; which was to be executed in the manner of Cervantes (the original author of this ſpecies of ſatire) under the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of ſome feigned adventures. "They had obſerved," ſays the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and learned Editor of Mr. Pope's works, "thoſe abuſes ſtill kept their ground, againſt all that the graveſt and ableſt authors
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0613800301:268"/>
could ſay to diſcredit them: They concluded, therefore, the force of ridicule was wanting to quicken their diſgrace; which was here in its place, when the abuſes had already been detected by ſober reaſoning; and <hi>truth</hi> in no danger to ſuffer by the <hi>premature</hi> uſe of ſo powerful an inſtrument." But the proſecution of this noble deſign, at leaſt in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular way, was prevented by the Queen's death, which exceedingly diſconcerted Pope, Swift, and Arbuthnot, who were all of them warmly attached to Lord Oxford's miniſtry; and a final period was afterwards put to the project, by the ſeparation and growing infirmities of Dr. Swift, by the bad health of Dr. Arbuthnot, and other concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cauſes. The imperfect Eſſay which was drawn out towards this deſign, under the title of the firſt Book of the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus, is ſufficient to make us greatly regret that it was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted. A critical account of this undertaking, and of the ſhare which Dr. Arbuthnot had in it, we here preſent to the reader. "Polite letters," adds the celebrated Editor before mentioned, "never loſt more, than in the defeat of this ſcheme; in the execution of which, each of this illuſtrious triumvirate would have found exerciſe for his own peculiar talents; beſides conſtant employment for thoſe they all had in common. Dr. Arbuthnot was ſkilled in every thing which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to <hi>Science:</hi> Mr. Pope was a maſter in the <hi>fine Arts</hi>; and Dr. Swift excelled in the <hi>Knowledge of the World.</hi> WIT they had all in equal meaſure; and this ſo large, that no age perhaps ever produced three men to whom Nature had more bountifully beſtowd it, or Art had brought it to higher perfection." We are told by the ſame writer, that the travels of Guliver were firſt intended as a part of Scriblerus's Memoirs. Queen Anne's death made ſo deep an impreſſion upon Dr. Arbuthnot's ſpirits, that, to divert his melancholy, he went to Paris, where a brother of his reſided. His ſtay there, however, was very ſhort; for he returned to London in the beginning of September. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time, he appears to have been in ſome ſuſpence whether he ſhould be permitted to hold his place at St. James's; but being at length told that he was to loſe it, he philoſophically obſerved to Dr. Swift, that "he hoped to be able to keep a little habitation warm in town." Indeed, conſidering his attrchment to former men and meaſures, it is not ſurpriſing that he ſhould be deprived of his ſituation in the royal houſehold; though it might have been to the honour of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have ſhewn a peculiar indulgence to a man of ſuch diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed genius and merit. Dr. Arbuthnot, having quitted St. James's, where he appears generally to have lived while he was phyſician to Queen Anne, took a houſe in Dover-Street. Some time after, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Mr. Pope, he was engaged in giving aſſiſtance to Mr
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0613800301:269"/>
Gay in the Comedy, or rather the Farce, of <hi>Three Hours after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> This play was brought upon the ſtage in 1717, and was ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, being damned on the firſt night of its repreſentation. At the Bath ſeaſon, in the latter end of 1722, Dr. Arbuthnot went to that city, apparently for his health, being accompanied by one of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who was lately come to England, and whoſe ſingular and amiable character is well drawn by Mr. Pope, in a letter to Mr. Digby. On the 30th of September 1723, the Doctor was choſen ſecond Cenſor of the Royal College of Phyſicians. In 1725 he was ſeized with a moſt unuſual and dangerous diſtemper, an impoſthume in the bowels; from which he ſpeedily and happily recovered, to the great joy of his friends. He publiſhed, in 1727, in quarto, his work, intitled, <hi>Tables of Ancient Coins, Weights and Meaſures, explained and exemplified, in ſeveral Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> In the ſame year, on the 5th of October, he was made an Elect of the College of Phyſicians: and, on the 18th of that month, he pronounced the Harveian Oration. During all this time, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the practice of his profeſſion with good reputation; and, among other eminent perſons whom he attended in his medical capacity, was the late Earl of Cheſterfield, who was proud to have ſuch a man for his friend, as well as for his Phyſician. Dr. Arbuthnot was not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſo deeply engaged in buſineſs, but that he could find leiſure to write ſeveral pieces of wit and humour, among which his Epitaph on the infamous Colonel Chartres, which came out in 1731, hath been particularly admired. Much about the ſame time, he wrote a very entertaining paper, concerning the <hi>Altercation</hi> or <hi>ſcolding of the Ancients.</hi> In 1732 he had an opportunity of contributing his endeavours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards detecting and puniſhing the ſcandalous frauds and abuſes which had been carried on, under the ſpecious name of <hi>The Charitable Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> In the ſame year, he publiſhed his treatiſe concerning the "Nature and Choice of Aliments;" which was followed, in 1733, by his eſſay on "The Effects of Air on human Bodies." A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt publication, he met with a ſevere domeſtic affliction, in the loſs of his ſon Charles, hereafter mentioned, "whoſe life, he ſays, if it had ſo pleaſed God, he would willingly have redeemed with his own." Nevertheleſs, he added, with the greateſt piety, "I thank God for a new leſſon of ſubmiſſion to his will, and likewiſe for what he hath left me." Dr. Arbuthnot is thought to have been led to the medical ſubjects juſt mentioned, by the conſideration of his own caſe. His diſorder was an aſthma, which, having gradually increaſed with his years, became, at length, deſperate and incurable. Under this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, he retired, in 1734, with a view of obtaining ſome ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, to Hampſtead; from whence, in anſwer to a kind enquiry of Mr. Pope, he gave that friend a particular account of his diſtemper, and of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0613800301:270"/>
his having no expectations of a recovery. In a letter, written two or three months after, to his other great friend, Dr. Swift, he diſplays the reſignation, calmneſs, and piety of his mind. Though he met with a temporary relief at Hampſtead, and eſpecially from riding, yet, being ſenſible that an effectual cure of his diſeaſe was impoſſible, he thought proper to return to his own houſe in Cork-Street, Burlington-Gardens, where he departed this life, on the 27th of February 1734-5.</p>
            <p>Dr. Arbuthnot appears, in every reſpect, to have been a moſt amiable and worthy man; and the juſtneſs of the following account of him, which comes from the ingenious pen of Lord Orrery, will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all who are acquainted with the Doctor's life and writings. His Lordſhip, ſpeaking of that part of Swift's epiſtolary correſpondence which only was then publiſhed, adds, "I ſhould have been much pleaſed in finding ſome of Dr. Arbuthnot's letters among this collection. Although he was juſtly celebrated for wit and learning, there was an excellence in his character more amiable than all his other qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: I mean the excellence of his heart. He has ſhewn himſelf equal to any of his contemporaries in humour and vivacity; and he was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to moſt men in acts of humanity and benevolence. His very ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſms are the ſatyrical ſtrokes of good nature: They are like ſlaps in the face given in jeſt, the effects of which may raiſe bluſhes, but no blackneſs will appear after the blows. He laughs as jovially as an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant upon Bacchus, but continues as ſober and conſiderate as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Socrates. He is ſeldom ſerious, except in his attacks upon vice; and then his ſpirit riſes with a manly ſtrength, and a noble indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. His epitaph upon Chartres (allowing one ſmall alteration, the word <hi>permitted,</hi> inſtead of <hi>connived at</hi>) is a complete and a maſterly compoſition in its kind. No man exceeded him in the moral duties of life: a merit ſtill more to his honour, as the ambitious powers of wit and genius are ſeldom ſubmiſſive enough to confine themſelves within the limitations of morality. In his letter to Mr. Pope, written, as it were, upon his death-bed, he diſcovers ſuch a noble fortitude of mind at the approach of his diſſolution, as could be inſpired only by a clear conſcience, and the calm retroſpect of an uninterrupted ſeries of virtue. The DEAN laments the loſs of him with a pathetic ſincerity. <hi>The deaths of</hi> Mr. Gay, <hi>and the</hi> Doctor, ſays he to Mr. Pope, <hi>have been ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible wounds near my heart. Their living would have been a great comfort to me, although I ſhould never have ſeen them: like a ſum of money in a bank, from which I ſhould receive at leaſt annual intereſt, as I do from you, and have done from Bolingbroke.</hi>" This teſtimony of Lord Orrery's, to the merit of Dr. Arbuthnot, is confirmed by that of Mr. Pope, who uſed to repreſent his morals as equal to any man's, and his wit and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0613800301:271"/>
as ſuperior to thoſe of all mankind. So prolific was his wit, that in this quality Swift only held the ſecond place. No adventure of any conſequence ever occurred, on which the Doctor did not write a pleaſant eſſay, in a great folio book, which uſed to lie in his parlour. Of theſe, however, he was ſo negligent, that while he was writing them at one end, he ſuffered his children to tear them out at the other, for their paper-kites. We learn, from Mr. George Arburthnot, that his father ſeldom related any thing of himſelf or his writings; which he neglected ſo much when finiſhed, that he was ſometimes at a loſs to find them. The integrity of his character is well expreſſed in a letter to Dr. Swift: "I have not ſeen any thing as yet, to make me recant a certain inconvenient opinion I have, that one cannot pay too dear for peace of mind." Dr Arbuthnot always made it a point to ſtand up for the honour of religion. We are told, that he was often with Lord Cheſterfield in the morning, and more than once declared himſelf, in his Lordſhip's preſence, a patron of Chriſtianity. But the Doctor's zeal and ſteadineſs in this reſpect will beſt appear in one of his own letters. "My neighbour, the Proſeman, is wiſer, and more cowardly and deſpairing than ever. He talks me into a fit of vapours twice or thrice a week. I dream at night of a chain, and rowing in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. But, thank God, he has not taken from me the freedom I have been accuſtomed to in my diſcourſe (even with the greateſt perſons to whom I have acceſs), in defending the cauſe of Liberty, Virtue, and Religion. For the laſt, I have the ſatisfaction of ſuffering ſome ſhare of the ignominy that belonged to the firſt confeſſors. This has been my lot, from a ſteady reſolution I have taken of giving theſe ignorant impudent fellows battle upon all occaſions." There is nothing which more diſtinguiſhes Dr. Arbuthnot's character, than the cheerfulneſs of his temper. In a letter wretten to Dr. Swift, in 1723, he ſays, "As for your humble ſervant, <hi>with a great ſtone in his right kidney,</hi> and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of men and women to provide for, he is as cheerful as ever in public affairs." It was not to public affairs only that this diſpoſition was confined: for it evidently appears to have accompanied him in every ſituation, and every affliction of life; a circumſtance which we the rather take notice of, as a reflection to the diſadvantage of it hath been thrown out by a late writer. Upon the whole, we may conclude, after the moſt impartial ſurvey of Dr. Arbuthnot's character, that his memory is intitled to diſtinguiſhed honour, as a man of wit, a man of ſcience and literature, and a man of religion and virtue. In ſaying this, we do not mean to aſſert, that we entirely approve, in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of his choice of the objects againſt which his humour and ſatire were directed. In ſome of his political principles we greatly differ from
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0613800301:272"/>
him; and we think that caſes might be mentioned, in which his ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule was too ſeverely pointed at men of real abilities and merit. The Doctor is ſaid, but at what particular period we are not informed, to have been ſome time Steward to the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy. He was a married man, and, beſides other children, had two ſons, George and Charles; the latter of whom was educated at Chriſt Church College, Oxford, and entered int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> holy orders. Two daughters ſurvived him, who are ſince dead, unmarried. George, who is ſtill living,, is firſt Secondary in the Remembrance-Office, a place of very conſiderable profit. He is poſſeſſed of an ample fortune beſides, and is a gentleman of known and acknowledged worth and character. Dr. Arbuthnot ſhared the ſame fate with his friends Pope and Swift, in having ſeveral literary brats illegitimately fathered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; and among the reſt, the famous Romance of <hi>Robinſon Cruſoe.</hi> There came out, in 1751, in two volumes 12 <hi>mo. The Miſcellaneous Works of the late Dr. Arbuthnot</hi>; to which is prefixed the following advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: "The contents of theſe volumes, and what is inſerted in Swift's Miſcellanies, comprehend all the pieces of wit and humour of this admirable author." Although this collection, which hath gone through various editions, undoubtedly contains ſome of his genuine productions; yet every reader of taſte and diſcernment will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that many, if not moſt of the tracts here aſcribed to him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have proceeded from his excellent pen: and George Arbuthnot, Eſq. upon the peruſal of them, hath teſtified, that the greateſt part of them were not written by his father.</p>

            <head>ARISTOPHANES,</head>
            <p>A CELEBRATED comic poet of Athens. His place of nativity, however, has been conteſted, for his enemies endeavoured to repreſent him as a ſtranger: but he fully confuted this ſuggeſtion, repeating on this occaſion a verſe of Telemachus in the Odyſſey, thus tranſlated:
<q>
                  <l>My mother told me ſo: 'twas he, ſhe ſaid;</l>
                  <l>I know not: and, pray, who has more to plead?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He was contemporary with Plato, Socrates, and Euripides, and moſt of his plays were written during the Peloponneſian war. His imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was warm and lively, and his genius particularly turned to raillery: he had alſo great ſpirit and reſolution, and was a declared enemy to ſlavery, and to all thoſe who wanted to oppreſs their country. The Athenians ſuffered themſelves in his time to be governed by men, who had no other views than to make themſelves maſters of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0613800301:273"/>
Ariſtophanes expoſed the deſigns of theſe men, with great wit and ſeverity, upon the ſtage. Cleon was the firſt whom he attacked; in his comedy of the Equites; and as there was not one of the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians who would venture to perſonate a man of his great authority, Ariſtophanes played the character himſelf, and with ſo much ſucceſs, that the Athenians obliged Cleon to pay a fine of five talents, which were given to the poet. He deſcribed the affairs of the Athenians in ſo exact a manner, that his comedies are a faithful hiſtory of that people. For this reaſon, when Dionyſius king of Syracuſe deſired to learn the ſtate and language of Athens, Plato ſent him the comedies of Ariſtophanes, telling him theſe were the beſt repreſentation thereof. He wrote above fifty comedies, but there are only eleven extant which are perfect; theſe are Plutus, the Clouds, the Frogs, Equites, the Acharnenſes, the Waſps, Peace, the Birds, the Eccleſiazuſae or Female Orators, the Theſmophoſiazuſae or Prieſteſſes of Ceres, and Lyſiſtrata. The Clouds, which he wrote in ridicule to Socrates, is the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated of all his comedies: Madam Dacier tells us, ſhe was ſo much charmed with this performance, that after ſhe had tranſlated it, and read it over two hundred times, it did not become the leaſt tedious to her, which ſhe could not ſay of any other piece; and that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which ſhe received from it, was ſo exquiſite, that ſhe forgot all the contempt and indignation which Ariſtophanes deſerved for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wit to ruin a man, who was wiſdom itſelf, and the greateſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the city of Athens. Ariſtophanes having conceived ſome averſion to the poet Euripides, ſatirizes him in ſeveral of his plays, particularly in his Frogs and his Theſmophoſiazuſae. He wrote his Peace in the tenth year of the Peloponneſian war, when a treaty for fifty years was concluded between the Athenians and the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, though it continued but ſeven years. The Acharnenſes was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after the death of Pericles, and the loſs of the battle in Sicily, in order to diſſuade the people from intruſting the ſafety of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to ſuch imprudent generals as Lamachus. Soon after, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented his Aves, or Birds, by which he admoniſhed the Athenians to fortify Decelaea, which he calls by a fictitious name Nepheloccoccy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia. The Veſpae or Waſps, was written after another loſs in Sicily, which the Athenians ſuffered from the miſconduct of Chares. He wrote the Lyſiſtrata when all Greece was involved in a war; in which comedy the women are introduced debating upon the affairs of the commonwealth, when they came to a reſolution, not to go to bed with their huſbands till a peace ſhould be concluded. His Plutus, and other comedies of that kind, were written after the magiſtrates had given orders, that no perſon ſhould be expoſed by name upon the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0613800301:274"/>
ſtage. He invented a peculiar kind of verſe, which was called by his name, and is mentioned by Cicero in his Brutus; and Suidas ſays, that he alſo was the inventor of the tetrameter and octometer verſe.</p>
            <p>Ariſtophanes was greatly admired amongſt the ancients, eſpecially for the true attic elegance of his ſtyle: "It is (ſays Madam Dacier) as agreeable as his wit; for beſides its purity, force, and ſweetneſs, it has a certain harmony, which ſounds extremely pleaſant to the ear: when he has occaſion to uſe the common ordinary ſtyle, he does it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing any expreſſion that is baſe and vulgar; and when he has a mind to expreſs himſelf loftily, in his higheſt flight he is never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure." "Let no man (ſays Scaliger) pretend to underſtand the attic dialect, who has not Ariſtophanes at his fingers ends; in him are to be found all the attic ornaments, which made St. Chryſoſtom ſo much admire him, that he always laid him under his pillow when he went to bed." Mr. Frichlin obſerves, that Plautus has a great affinity to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophanes in his manner of writing, and has imitated him in many parts of his plays. Frichlin has written a vindication of our poet, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the objections urged againſt him by Plutarch. How great an opinion Plato had of Ariſtophanes is evident even from Plutarch's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, who tells us, that this poet's Diſcourſe upon Love was inſerted by that philoſopher in his Sympoſium: and Cicero, in his firſt book, De Legibus, ſtyles him "the moſt witty poet of the old comedy." There have been ſeveral editions and tranſlations of this poet. The time of his death is unknown; but it is certain he was living after the expulſion of the tyrants by Thraſybulus, whom he mentions in his Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and other comedies.</p>

            <head>ARISTOTLE,</head>
            <p>THE chief of the peripatetic philoſophers, born at Stagyra, a ſmall city in Macedon, in the 99th Olympiad, about three hundred and eighty-four years before the birth of Chriſt. He was the ſon of Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus, phyſician to Amyntas, the grandfather of Alexander the Great. He loſt his parents in his infancy; and Proxenes, a friend of his father's, who had the care of his education, taking but little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him, he quitted his ſtudies, and gave himſelf up to the follies of youth. After he had ſpent moſt of his patrimony, he entered into the army; but not ſucceeding in this profeſſion, he went to Delphos, to conſult the oracle what courſe of life he ſhould follow; when he was adviſed to go to Athens, and ſtudy philoſophy. He accordingly went thither when about eighteen years of age, and ſtudied under Plato till he was thirty-ſeven. By this time he had ſpent his whole fortune; and we are told that he got his living by ſelling powders, and ſome receipts in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0613800301:275"/>
pharmacy. He followed his ſtudies with moſt extraordinary dilligence, ſo that he ſoon ſurpaſſed all in Plato's ſchool. He eat little, ſlept leſs; and that he might not over-ſleep himſelf, Diogenes Laertius tells us, that he lay always with one hand out of the bed, having a ball of braſs in it, which, by its falling into a baſon of the ſame metal, awaked him. We are told, that Ariſtotle had ſeveral conferences with a learn-Jew at Athens, and that by this means he inſtructed himſelf in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and religion of the Aegyptians, and that he thereby ſaved himſelf the trouble of travelling into Egypt. When he had ſtudied about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years under Plato, he began to form different tenets from thoſe of his maſter, who became highly piqued at his behaviour. Upon the death of Plato, he quitted Athens, and retired to Atarnya, a little city of Myſia, where his old friend Hermias reigned. Here he married Pythias, the ſiſter of this prince, whom he is ſaid to have loved ſo paſſionately, that he offered ſacrifice to her. Some time after, Hermias having been taken priſoner by Meranon, the king of Perſia's general, Ariſtotle went to Mitylene, the capital of Leſbos, where he remained till Philip, king of Macedon, having heard of his great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ſent for him to be tutor to his ſon Alexander, then about fourteen years of age, Ariſtotle accepted the offer, and in eight years taught him rhetoric and natural philoſophy, which, according to Plutarch, he taught nobody elſe. Philip erected ſtatues in honour of Ariſtotle, and for his ſake rebuilt Stagyra, which had been almoſt ruined by the wars.</p>
            <p>Ariſtotle having loſt the favour of Alexander by adhering to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes, his kinſman, who was accuſed of a conſpiracy againſt Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander's life, he removed to Athens, where he ſet up his new ſchool. The magiſtrates received him very kindly, and gave him the Lycaeum, ſo famous afterwards for the concourſe of his diſciples: and here it was, according to ſome authors, that he compoſed his principal works. Plutarch, however, tells us, that he had already wrote his books of Phyſics, Morals, Metaphyſics and Rhetoric. The ſame author ſays, that Ariſtotle being piqued at Alexander, becauſe of the preſents he had ſent to Xenocrates, was moved with ſo much reſentment, that he entered into Antipater's conſpiracy againſt this prince. The advocates for Ariſtotle, however, maintain this charge to have been without foundation; that at leaſt it made no impreſſion on Alexander, ſince about the ſame time he ordered him to apply himſelf to the ſtudy of animals; and ſent him, in order to defray his expences, eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred talents, which amounts to four hundred and eighty thouſand crowns, beſides a great number of fiſhers and huntſmen to bring him all ſorts of animals. When Ariſtotle was accuſed of impiety by one Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymedon,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0613800301:276"/>
a prieſt of Ceres, he wrote a large apology for himſelf, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the magiſtrates: but knowing the Athenians to be extremely jealous in regard to their religion, and remembering the fate of Socrates, he was ſo much alarmed, that he retired to Chalcis, a city of Eubaea, where he ended his days. Some ſay he poiſoned himſelf, to avoid fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the hands of his enemies: others affirm, that he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Euripus, becauſe he could not comprehend the reaſon of its ebbing and flowing; and there are ſome who tell us he died of a cholic, in the ſixty-third year of his age, being the third of the 114th Olimpiad, two years after Alexander. The Stagyrites carried away his body, and erected altars to his memory.</p>
            <p>Beſides his treatiſes on philoſophy, he wrote alſo on poetry, rhetoric, law, &amp;c. to the number of four hundred treatiſes, according to Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Laertius; or more, according to Francis Patricius of Venice. An account of ſuch as are extant, and of thoſe ſaid to be loſt, may be ſeen in Fabricius's Bibliotheca Graeca. He left his writings with Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus, his beloved diſciple, and ſucceſſor in the Lycaeum, and forbad that they ſhould ever be publiſhed. Theophraſtus, at his death, truſted them to Neleus, his good friend and diſciple, whoſe heirs buried them in the ground at Scepſis, a town of Troas, to ſecure them from the king of Pergamus, who made great ſearch every where for books to adorn his library. Here they lay concealed one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty years, until, being almoſt ſpoiled, they were ſold to one Apellicon, a rich citizen of Athens. Sylla found them at this man's houſe, and ordered them to be carried to Rome. They were ſome time after purchaſed by Tyrannion a grammarian; and Andronicus of Rhodes having bought them of his heirs, was in a manner the firſt reſtorer of the works of this great philoſopher; for he not only repaired what had been decayed by time and ill keeping, but alſo put them in a better order, and got them copied. There were many who followed the doctrine of Ariſtotle in the reigns of the twelve Caeſars, and their numbers increaſed much under Adrian and Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus: Alexander Aphrodinus was the firſt profeſſor of the Peripatetic philoſophy at Rome, being appointed by the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus; and in ſucceeding ages the doctrine of Ariſtotle prevailed almoſt amongſt all men of letters, and many commentaries were wrote upon his works.</p>
            <p>The firſt Doctors of the church diſapproved of the doctrine of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle, as allowing too much to reaſon and ſenſe; but Anatolius, biſhop of Laodicea, Didymus of Alexandria, St. Jerom, and St. Auguſtin, and ſeveral others, at length wrote and ſpoke in favour of it. In the ſixth age, Boethius made him known in the weſt, and tranſlated ſome of his pieces into Latin. But from the time of Boethus to the eighth
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0613800301:277"/>
age, Joannes Damaſcenus was the only man who made an abridgment of his philoſophy, or wrote any thing concerning him. The Grecians, who took great pains to reſtore learning in the eleventh and following ages, applied much to the works of this philoſopher, and many learned men wrote commentaries on his writings: amongſt theſe were Alfarabius, Algazel, Avicenna, and Averroes. They taught his doctrine in Africa, and afterwards at Cordoya in Spain. The Spaniards introduced his doctrine into France, with the commentaries of Averroes and Avicenna; and it was taught in the univerſity of Paris, until Amauri, having ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome particular tenets on the principles of this philoſopher, was condemned of hereſy, in a council held there in 1210, when all the works of Ariſtotle that could be found were burnt, and the reading them forbidden under pain of excommunication. This prohibition was confirmed, as to the Phyſics and Metaphyſics, in 1215, by the Pope's legate; though at the ſame t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the year 1265, Simon, cardinal of St. Cecil, and legate from the holy ſee, prohibited the reading of the Phyſics and Metaphyſics of Ariſtotle. All theſe prohibitions, however, were taken off in 1366; for the cardinals of St. Mark and St. Martin, who were deputed by pope Urban V. to reform the univerſity of Paris, permitted the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe books, which had been prohibited: and in the year 1448, pope Stephen approved of all his works, and took care to have a new tranſlation of them into Latin.</p>

            <head>ARIUS,</head>
            <p>A DIVINE of the fourth century, the head and founder of the Arians, a ſect which denied the eternal divinity and conſubſtantiality of the Word. He was born in Lybia, near Egypt. Euſebius, biſhop of Nicomedia, a great favourite of Conſtantia, ſiſter of the emperor Conſtantine, and wife of Licinius, became a zealous promoter of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm. He took Arius under his protection, and introduced him to Conſtantia; ſo that the ſect increaſed, and ſeveral biſhops embraced it openly. There aroſe, however, ſuch diſputes in the cities, that the emperor, in order to remedy theſe diſorders, was obliged to aſſemble the council of Nice, where, in the year 325, the doctrine of Arius was condemned. Arius was baniſhed by the emperor, and all his books were ordered to be burnt, and capital puniſhment was denounced againſt whoever dared to keep them. After five years baniſhment, he was recalled to Conſtantinople, where he preſented to the emperor ſuch a profeſſion of faith as made him believe Arius quite orthodox. In the year 331, Arius went to Alexandria, where St. Athanaſius refuſed to receive him, notwithſtanding all his menaces and recommendatory let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0613800301:278"/>
He came to this city again in 335; but though Athanaſius had been ſent into exile, yet the people of Alexandria rejected Arius, who began to raiſe diſturbances in Egypt. Conſtantine being informed thereof, ſent orders to him to come to Conſtantinople, where his friends intended that he ſhould be received into the communion of that city. Conſtantine demanded of Arius, if he followed the Nicene faith? Arius aſſured him he did, by an oath; and the emperor having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a profeſſion of his faith, he preſented it to him in writing; but he had clothed his favourite tenets in the ſimplicity of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſions, and he took oath of his belief in the contents of the paper which he delivered. Conſtantine, being perſuaded of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of Arius, ordered Alexandria to admit him again into the church. Arius was now conducted in triumph by Euſebius and his other adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but as they approached the great ſquare of Conſtantinople, Arius being preſſed by a natural neceſſity, retired to a houſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, where he died inſtantly on the ſpot, all his entrails burſting out with his liver and ſpleen. This happened in the year 336. Arius's ſect however did not die with him, for it was ſupported by ſeveral biſhops, and ſeveral others of great weight in the church. The Arians, by turns, perſecuted, and were perſecuted. There are ſeveral authors who find fault with Arius, for putting his ſentiments into verſe, that they might be ſung by his diſciples; and they particularly cenſure the matter and form of his Thalia.</p>

            <head>ARMINIUS (JAMES,)</head>
            <p>THE founder of the ſect of Armenians, or Remonſtrants, born at Oude-water, in Holland, in 1560. He loſt his father in his infancy, and was indebted for the firſt part of his education to a good-natured clergyman, who had imbibed ſome of the opinions of the reformed, and who, in order to avoid being obliged to ſay maſs, often changed his habitation. Arminius was a ſtudent at Utrecht when death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his patron; this loſs would have embarraſſed him greatly, but that he had the good fortune to be aſſiſted by Rodolphus Snellius, his countryman, who took him with him to Marpurg in 1575. Soon after his arrival here, he had the news of his country having been ſacked by the Spaniards: this plunged him into the moſt dreadful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, nor could he help returning to Holland, to be himſelf an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of the ſtate to which things were reduced; but having found that his mother, his ſiſters, his brethren, and almoſt all the inhabitants of Oude-water had been murdered, he returned to Marpurg: his ſtay here was, however, but ſhort, for he returned again to Holland, being
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0613800301:279"/>
informed of the foundation of the univerſity of Leyden, and purſued his ſtudies at this new academy with ſo much aſſiduity and ſucceſs, that he acquired very great reputation. He was ſent to Geneva, in 1583, at the expence of the magiſtrates of Amſterdam, to perfect his ſtudies: and here he applied himſelf chiefly to the lectures of Theodore Beza, who was at this time explaining the Epiſtle to the Romans. Arminius had the misfortune to diſpleaſe ſome of the leading men of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, becauſe he maintained the philoſophy of Ramus in public with great warmth, and taught it in private: being obliged therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, he went to Baſil, where he was received with great kindneſs. Here he acquired ſuch great reputation, that the faculty of divinity offered him the degree of doctor without any expence; but he modeſtly excuſed himſelf from receiving this honour, and returned to Geneva; where having found the adverſaries of Ramiſm leſs violent than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, he became alſo more moderate. He had a great deſire to ſee Italy, and particularly to hear the philoſophical lectures of the famous James Zabarella, at Padua. He ſatisfied this carioſity, and ſpent ſix or ſeven months in the journey: he then returned to Geneva, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to Amſterdam, where he found many calumnies had been raiſed againſt him, on account of his journey to Italy, which had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cooled the affections of the magiſtrates of Amſterdam, his friends and patrons. He eaſily juſtified himſelf to men of ſenſe, though many weak and ſuperſtitious perſons remained prejudiced againſt him. He was ordained miniſter at Amſterdam, the 11th of Auguſt, 1588, and ſoon diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his ſermons, which were remarkable for their ſolidity and learning: ſo that he was extremely followed, and univerſally applauded. Martin Lydius, profeſſor of divinity at Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neker, thought him a fit perſon to refute a writing, wherein the doctrine of Theodore Beza upon predeſtination, had been attacked by ſome miniſters of Delft: Arminius accordingly, at his earneſt entreaty, undertook to refute this work; but upon examining and weighing the arguments on both ſides, he embraced the opinions he propoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute; and even went farther than the miniſters of Delft. He was threatened with ſome trouble about this at Amſterdam, being accuſed of departing from the eſtabliſhed doctrine; but the magiſtrates of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam interpoſing their authority, prevented any diſſenſion. In 1603, he was called to the profeſſorſhip of divinity at Leyden: he began his lectures with three elegant orations; the firſt, Of the object of divinity; the ſecond, Of the author and End of it; and the third, Of the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it: and then proceeded to the expoſition of the prophet Jonah. The diſputes upon grace ſoon after kindled in the univerſity, and the ſtates of the province were forced to appoint conferences betwixt him
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0613800301:280"/>
and his adverſaries. Gomarus was a great perſecutor of Arminius; but the reputation of the latter was ſo well eſtabliſhed, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually attended by a numerous audience, who admired the ſtrength of argument and ſolid learning which he ſhewed in all his lectures: this expoſed him to the envy of his brethren, who treated him with great outrage. In the year 1607, he wrote an excellent letter to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of the elector palatine, to vindicate his conduct with regard to the conteſts about religion, in which he was engaged: and the ſame year gave a full account to the States of Holland, of his ſentiments with regard to the controverted points. Theſe conteſts, however, his continual labour, and his uneaſineſs at ſeeing his reputation blaſted by a number of ſlanders, threw him into a fit of ſickneſs, of which he died the 19th of October, 1609. Dominic Baudius and Hugo Grotius wrote each of them a poem upon his death; and Daniel Heinſius did the ſame: but this poem was afterwards ſuppreſſed in the addition of his works.</p>
            <p>Arminius was eſteemed an excellent preacher; his voice was low, but very agreeable; and his pronunciation admirable: he was eaſy and affable to perſons of all ranks, and facetious in his converſation amongſt his friends. His great deſire was, that Chriſtians would bear with one another in all controverſies, which did not affect the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of their religion; and when they perſecuted each other for points of indifference, it gave him the utmoſt diſſatisfaction. His enemies endeavoured to repreſent him in the moſt diſadvantageous light, but his memory has been ſufficiently vindicated by men of the greateſt diſtinction. He left ſeveral works</p>

            <p>(JOSEPH CAESAR) a famous painter, born in the year 1560, at the caſtle of Arpinas, in the kingdom of Naples. He lived in great intimacy with pope Clement VIII. who conferred upon him the honour of knighthood, and beſtowed on him many other marks of his friendſhip. In the year 1600, he went to Paris with cardinal Aldobrandin, who was ſent legate to the French court, on the marriage of Henry IV. with Mary of Medicis. His Chriſtian majeſty gave Arpinas many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable preſents, and created him a knight of St. Michael. The colouring of this painter is thought to be cold and inanimate; yet there is ſpirit in his deſigns, and his compoſitions have ſomewhat of fire and elevation.

            <head>ARRIAN,</head>
            <p>A FAMOUS hiſtorian and philoſopher, who lived under the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Hadrian and the two Antoninuſes, born at Nicomedia in Bithynia. He was ſtyled the ſecond Xenophon, and was raiſed to the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable dignities of Rome. Mr. Tillemont takes him to be the ſame perſon with that Flaccus Arrianus, who, being governor of Cappadocia, ſtopped the incurſions of the Alani, and ſent an account of his voyage round the Euxine ſee to Hadrian. He is ſaid to have been preceptor to the famous philoſopher and emperor Marcus Antoninus. There are extant four books of his Diatribae, or Diſſertations upon Epictetus, whoſe diſciple he had been; and Photius tells us that he compoſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe twelve books of that philoſopher's diſcourſes. We are told by another author, that he wrote the Life and Death of Epictetus. The moſt celebrated of his works in his Hiſtory, in Greek, of Alexander the Great, in ſeven books: a performance much eſteemed by the beſt judges. Photius mentions alſo his hiſtory of Bithynia, another of the Alani, and a third of the Parthians in ſeventeen books, which he brought down to the war carried on by Trajan againſt them. He gives us likewiſe an abridgment of Arrian's ten books of the Hiſtory of the Succeſſors of Alexander the Great: and tells us alſo, that he wrote an account of the Indies in one book, which is ſtill extant. The work which he firſt entered upon was the Hiſtory of Bithynia, but wanting the proper memoirs and materials for it, he ſuſpended the execution of this deſign till he had publiſhed ſome other performances. This hiſtory conſiſted of eight books, and was carried down till the time when Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes reſigned Bithynia to the Romans: but there is nothing of it remaining but what is quoted in Photius and Stephanus Byzantinus. Arrian is ſaid to have written ſeveral other works: Lucian tells us, that he wrote the life of a robber, whoſe name was Tiliborus: this author, endeavouring to excuſe himſelf for the pains he had taken in writing the Life of Alexander the Impoſtor, ſpeaks in the following manner: "Let no perſon (ſays he) accuſe me of having employed my labour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too low and mean a ſubject, ſince Arrian, the worthy diſciple of Epictetus, who is one of the greateſt men amongſt the Romans, and who has paſſed his whole life amongſt the Muſes, condeſcended to write the Life of Tiliborus." There is likewiſe, under the name of Arrian, a Periplus of the Red-ſea, that is, of the eaſtern coaſts of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica and Aſia, as far as the Indies; but authors are not agreed whether this is the production of the author of whom we write. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0613800301:282"/>
a book of Tactics under his name, the beginning of which is loſt; to theſe is added the order which he gave for the marching of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man army againſt the Alani, and giving them battle, which may very properly be aſcribed to our author, who was engaged in a war againſt that people.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral other perſons of his name: Julius Capitolinus, in his Life of the Emperor Gordian, mentions a Greek hiſtorian of that name: this cannot be the Arrian of whom we write, ſince he lived an age before that emperor. Suetonius, in his Life of Tiberius, mentions a poet of the ſame name; but he was more ancient than the other two, ſince Tiberius endeavoured to imitate him in his Greek poems: he is very probably the ſame, who, according to Suidas, wrote the Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drias, an heroic poem in twenty-four book, upon the actions of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the Great.</p>

Arſenius arrived at Conſtantinople in the year 383. The emperor happening one day to go into the room where Arſenius was inſtructing Arcadius, he found his ſon ſeated and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor ſtanding; he reproached the latter for not ſupporting properly the dignity of his employment: Arſenius politely excuſed himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that having the honour to ſpeak to an emperor (for Arcadius had been aſſociated to the empire at eight years of age) he could not, with good manners, remain ſeated in his preſence.

the glory of the Britons, procured him quickly a competent army, with which he routed Colgrin and all his forces, conſiſting of Saxons, Scots, and Picts, on the banks of the river Douglas, but not without very conſiderable loſs on his own ſide. Upon this, Colgrin retired with the remains of his army into York, where Arthur beſieged him, and while he lay before the place, Cador Duke of Cornwall defeated Baldulph the brother of Colgrin, who with ſix thouſand men came to his relief. The King however could not take York; for Cheldric, or Cerdic, King of the Saxons, landing in Albania, <hi>i.e.</hi> Scotland, with a prodigious number of men, from on board a fleet of ſix hundred ſail, marched towards the Britons; upon which, by the advice of his council, Arthur raiſed the ſiege of York, and marched to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. On his arrival in that city, he called a general aſſembly, wherein the ſtate of affairs having been thoroughly debated, it was agreed to ſend ambaſſadors to Hoel King of Armorica, <hi>i. e.</hi> Britanny, who was Arthur's ſiſter's ſon, to intreat his aſſiſtance; which being accordingly done, Hoel himſelf embarked with fifteen thouſand men, and landing at Southampton, then called the Port of Hamo, quickly found his uncle, who received him with all the affection and reſpect imaginable. Immediately after this junction, Arthur and his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man marched to oblige the Saxons to raiſe the ſiege of Kaerlind coit, now called Lincoln. The Saxons, upon their approach, inſtantly roſe from before the place, that with the greater conveniency they might fight the Britons. The battle was bloody and obſtinate; but at laſt the Saxons were overthrown with the loſs of ſix thouſand men, part killed, and part drowned in the rivers. The remains of the army retired to the woods of Caledon, which moſt probably are Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don woods in Lincolnſhire, where they made a brave ſtand; but being ſurrounded by the Britons, were at laſt obliged to ſurrender up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

For the performance of theſe articles they gave hoſtages, and were then ſuffered to retire in order to embark quietly. But in their voyage repenting of what they had done, they landed at Totneſs, burnt all the country as far as the Severn ſea, ſlaughtered the peaſants, ruined the villages, and at length laid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When this news was brought to King Arthur, who was on the point of marching againſt the Scots and Picts, he inſtantly ordered the Saxon hoſtages to be put to death, and then marched to the relief of the beſieged city. When he drew near it, himſelf firſt made a ſpeech to the army,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0613800301:288"/>
and then the Archbiſhop Dubricius harangued them likewiſe, and gave them his bleſſing. On the day of battle, Arthur put on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent coat of mail, a golden helmet, with the figure of a dragon upon the top thereof: acroſs his ſhoulder hung his ſhield, called Pridwen or Prywen, wherein was pictured the Virgin Mary, bearing the child Jeſus in her arms: he had likewiſe by his ſide his ſword called Calliburn, and in his right hand he bore his lance Rou. Thus equipped, he attacked the Saxons, who were drawn up in the form of a wedge. The battle laſted from morning till evening, when the Saxons withdrew to the top of a high hill, and there encamped. The next day Arthur attacked them again; but they made a gallant defence, till the greateſt part of the day was worn out, which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Arthur, that he threw himſelf among the foremoſt ranks, and, with great hazard of his perſon, performed there incredible feats of valour, for he ſlew with his own hand four hundred and ſeventy men. The Britons, encouraged by the example of their prince, forced the Saxon camp on all hands, and put many thouſands of them to the ſword, amongſt whom fell Colgrin and Baldulph. But as for Cerdic he carried off the remains of his army, and endeavoured to recover his ſhips. After the important victory at Badon, Arthur received advice, that the Scots and Picts had beſieged the city of Aclud, which is thought to be Dunbritton in Scotland, where he left his nephew Hoel ſick, at the time he marched back againſt the Saxons. To his aſſiſtance, therefore, the generous Britiſh Prince marched with all the alacrity imaginable, leaving Cador Duke of Cornwall to purſue the Saxons. On his approach, the Scots and Picts not only raiſed the ſiege, but fled precipitately to Lough-Lomond, where they endeavoured to fortify themſelves in the iſlands; but Arthur having quickly equipped a fleet, obliged them to ſurrender, and out of his great clemency pardoned them. In the mean time Cador, Duke of Cornwall, taking a circuit round the Saxons, and thereby giving them time to collect themſelves into a body, and to refreſh after their fatigues, ſuddenly ſeized and carried away their ſhips, and then marched in queſt of them, who, perceiving their deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, retired into the iſle of Thanet, where Cador blocked them up with their own ſhips, and after killing their commander Cerdic in fight, forced them to ſurrender upon articles, and to give hoſtages once more for their departing out of the kingdom. This done, Cador rejoined the king, who kept his Chriſtmas at York, where he deſtroyed the temples of the Pagans, reſtored the Chriſtian churches and appointed Pyramus, his chaplain, Archbiſhop of this See.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0613800301:289"/>
He alſo promoted Auguſel to the ſovereignty over the Scots, reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other perſons of diſtinction, and took himſelf to wife Guanhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara, a lady deſcended from the Romans, of exquiſite beauty, bred up in the family of Cador Duke of Cornwall. The next ſummer he fitted out a fleet, and therewith invaded Ireland, of which Guilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murius was the chief King, who, to oppoſe him, drew together a numerous army, which Arthur defeated, and made him priſoner: upon this all the petty princes in the iſland ſubmitted. Then he ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Iceland, which he likewiſe ſubdued, and received the ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Doldavius King of Gothland, and Gunſaſius King of the Orkneys, whom the very terror of his arms had reduced to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. After this he returned into Britain, and governed here twelve years in peace, with ſuch magnificence and ſplendor, that all Europe was amazed at it, and the greateſt potentates ſtood in fear of him. At length Sichelin, King of the Norwegians dying, and leaving his kingdom to Lot, Arthur's brother-in-law, the people of Norway, notwithſtanding, ſet up Riculf. On this pretence, therefore, Arthur invaded that kingdom, defeated the Norwegians, killed Riculf, conquered Norway and Dacia, that is, Denmark, and having given the whole to Lot, proceeded with his victorious army to invade Gaul, then a province, as our hiſtorian tells us, of the Roman empire. The greateſt part of the country he quickly ſubdued, blocked up the Roman governor in Paris, and reduced him to ſuch ſtraits there, that he was on the very point of ſtarving. In this diſtreſs he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged Arthur to a ſingle combat, which he was too gallant a man to refuſe; whereupon a bloody duel enſued, in which at firſt Arthur had the worſt, but at length he conquered and killed Flollo, upon which Paris ſurrendered. He ſpent, however, nine years in conquering the reſt of France, after which he returned to that city, and kept a royal court, beſtowing Neuſtria, afterwards called Normandy, upon his butler, Bedver, and the reſt of the provinces upon his domeſtics. Upon the approach of the feaſt of Pentecoſt, Arthur determined to to call a great aſſembly of the moſt noble of his ſubjects, which he appointed to be held at Caerleon in Montgomeryſhire; becauſe ſtanding on the river Uſk, near the Severn ſea, it was both pleaſant and commodious for the coming and going of thoſe who were invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Accordingly there aſſembled Auguſel, King of Scotland, the King of North-Wales, the King of South-Wales, Cador, now called King of Cornwall, the Archbiſhops of London, York, and Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, with a multitude of Britiſh Princes; there came likewiſe Guilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murius King of Ireland, Malvaſius King of Iceland, Doldavius King
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0613800301:290"/>
of Gothland, Gunfaſius King of the Orkneys, Lot King of Norway Aſchillius King of the Dacians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At this time he was ſolemnly crowned, the Kings of Scotland, Cornwall, North and South-Wales, carrying four golden ſwords before him. Not long after this, the Romans demanded tribute, which Arthur, by the advice of his council, not only refuſed, but reſolved to make war upon them. A mighty army he gathered, and marched to Southampton where he embarked, leaving the government of Britain to his nephew Modred, the ſon of Lot, by his ſiſter Anne, before mentioned. But while he was a coaſting about the iſland, he had news brought him, that a Spaniſh giant had forcibly taken away Helena, the daughter of his nephew Hoel, Duke of Britanny, whom he had carried to mount St. Michael in Cornwall. Thither the King purſuing him, ſlew him in ſingle combat, after which he proceeded in the war he had firſt deſigned, and having therein triumphed over all the forces of the Roman empire, and ſlain with his own hand Lucius Tiberius, their General, as he was paſſing the Alps in order to go to Rome, he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed advice, that Modred his nephew had revolted, and had married Guanhumara his Queen. This, ſays our hiſtorian, obliged him to deſiſt from his enterprize againſt Leo, King of the Romans: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſending Hoel, King of Britanny, with a great army to ſecure the peace of Gaul, he, with the reſt of his forces, ſailed for Britain. Modred, knowing the badneſs of his cauſe, endeavoured to fortify himſelf by many and great alliances. With this view he once more called in the Saxons, and alſo invited, by promiſing great ſums of money, the Scots, Picts, and Iriſh, to fight under his banner. At length, having aſſembled eighty thouſand men, he led them down into Kent, to oppoſe his uncle, who he knew intended to land there. He could not however prevent Arthur's coming on ſhore; but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently engaged him, and after a bloody battle, in which many of the King's friends fell, was defeated and forced to fly to Wincheſter. As for the Queen, ſhe retired to the city of Caerleon, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Nun. King Arthur purſued his nephew to Wincheſter, and there a ſecond time engaged him, beat him, and forced him to fly towards Cornwall. There, on the banks of the river Camel, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred made a ſtand again with ſixty thouſand men, with whom Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur fought a third battle, wherein, after thouſands had been ſlain, and, amongſt them, many of the moſt honourable perſons on both ſides, at length, Modred himſelf was killed, and his army totally routed. In this engagement, however, our hero Arthur received ſeveral wounds, which forced him to retire into the iſland of Avalon,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0613800301:291"/>
where, feeling himſelf extremly weak, he reſigned the crown to Conſtantine, the ſon of Cador Duke of Cornwall, and a few days after died, A. D. 542. It is neceſſary to add a little ſober truth to this romantic ſtory, and therefore let us conclude this article with obſerving, that Henry II. who was the firſt of the Plantagenet line, being, in the laſt year of his reign, at Pembroke, and hearing there a Welſh bard ſinging to his harp the ſtory of our Arthur, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an account of his death and burial, in the church-yard of Glaſtenbury, between two pyramids, the King inſtantly gave orders that the matter ſhould be enquired into, and the body dug up. This was done as the King directed, and at the depth of ſeven feet, was found a vaſt ſtone, whereon was faſtened a leaden croſs, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on the inſide: Hic Jacet Sepultus Inclytus Rex Arturius in Inſula Avalonia; <hi>Here lieth the famous King Arthur, buried in the Iſle of Avalon.</hi> Digging ſtill lower, they found the King's body in the trunk of a tree, his beautiful Queen lying by him, with long flowing hair, in colour bright as gold, which however ſunk into duſt when touched. The King's bones were very large ſized, and in his ſkull there were ten wounds or more all cicatrized, except that of which he died. This diſcovery was made in the year 1189, as Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus Cambrenſis tells us, who ſaw theſe bones, and examined the whole matter carefully. There was alſo a table containing this ſtory, ſet up in the monaſtery of Glaſtenbury, and the leaden croſs, with the inſcription, remained there till the diſſolution of the monaſtery, where it was ſeen by the great antiquary, Leland; but what is become of it ſince, does not appear.</p>

            <p>ARCHBISHOP of Canterbury, in the reigns of Richard II. Henry IV. and Henry V. He was the ſecond ſon of Robert earl of Arundel and Warren, and brother of Richard Earl of Arundel, who was beheaded. — At twenty two years of age, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing archdeacon of Taunton, he was raiſed to the biſhopric of Ely, the 6th of April, 1375, in the reign of Edward III. He was a great benefactor to the church and palace of this ſee; among other dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he gave a curious table of maſſy gold, adorned with precious ſtones, which had been given to prince Edward, by the King of Spain, and ſold by the latter to biſhop Arundel. In 1386, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of England; two years after, he was tranſlated to the ſee of York; and in 1396, was advanced to the archiepiſcopal ſee of Canterbury, when he reſigned the chancellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. This was the firſt inſtance of the tranſlation of an archbiſhop of York to the ſee of Canterbury. Scarce was he fixed in this ſee,

               </gap> of viſitation. The affair was referred to King Richard, who deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it in favour of the archbiſhop. At his viſitation in London, he revived an old conſtitution, by which the inhabitants of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective pariſhes were obliged to pay to their rector one half-penny in the pound of the rent of their houſes. In the ſecond year of his tranſlation, a parliament being held at London, the commons, with the king's leave, impeached the archbiſhop, together with his brother the earl of Arundel, and the duke of Gloceſter, of high treaſon. The archbiſhop was ſentenced to be baniſhed, and within forty days to depart the kingdom on pain of death. He retired firſt to France, and then to the court of Rome, where pope Boniface IX. gave him a kind reception, and wrote a letter to King Richard in his favour; but this having no effect, his holineſs reſolved to interpoſe his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: he accordingly nominated Arundel to the biſhopric of St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew's, and declared his intention of giving him ſeveral preferments in England. The king being informed of the pope's deſigns, wrote a letter to him in the following terms: "Thomas, for his treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſpiracy againſt our crown and royal dignity, has been ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced only to perpetual baniſhment; whereas had he been dealt with, anſwerably to his demerits, he ought to have ſuffered the puniſhment of high treaſon; but in conſideration of his character, and out of regard to religion, we have thought fit to grant him his life, and abated the rigor of the law. But ſince his going beyond ſea, both ourſelf and our ſubjects are much ſurprized at the turn of his fortune; for we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed he has been invited to your holineſs's court, countenanced in his miſbehaviour, taken into your protection, and put in hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his ſee, or at leaſt of being promoted in our kingdom to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices of greater value than thoſe he enjoyed before. How deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſuch unaccountable favours as theſe muſt be to our dignity and government, and to what apparent danger it may expoſe us, is eaſy to imagine: for which reaſon we are reſolved not to bear with ſuch treatment, though the whole world were of a different opinion; for we are thoroughly acquainted with this man, we know him to be of a turbulent, ſeditious temper, who, if he were permitted to live in our dominions, would return to his old practices, poiſon our ſubjects with miſreporting the adminiſtration, and endeavour to undermine our government; for it is probable he would uſe ſufficient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution not to fall under the laſh of the law. We deſire, therefore, that your Holineſs would prevent theſe opportunities of miſchief, and not ſhock our intereſts and inclinations by ſuch favours; for ſhould ſuch meaſures be put in execution, it is poſſible they might create<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſuch miſunderſtandings between the crown and the mitre, as it might prove difficult to remove: for, to ſpeak plainly, we cannot take that perſon for our friend, who careſſes our enemies, and takes them by the hand in ſo loving a manner. However, if you have a mind to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for him otherwiſe, we have nothing to object; only we cannot allow him to dip in our diſh.

This epiſtle had ſo good an effect upon his holineſs, that he withheld his intended favours from Arundel; and, at the king's requeſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted Roger Walden to the ſee of Canterbury.</p>

Being invited by king Alfred to his court, he gained ſo great a ſhare in that prince's favour, that he gave him the biſhopric of Shirburn, and made him abbot of the monaſteries of Amerſbury and Banwel, and, as Sir John Spelman tells us, of Exeter. According to Dr. Cave, it was he who perſuaded Alfred to found the univerſity of Oxford, and ſettle annual ſtipends upon the profeſſors of the ſeveral ſciences. We have a chronicle, or Annals, aſcribed to him. He died in the year 909.</p>

            <head>ATHELING (EDGAR),</head>
            <p>THE ſon of Edward, the ſon of Edmond Ironſide, king of England, by Agatha, daughter to Solomon, king of Hungary, or rather of the Emperor Henry II. In what year he was born is not certain; but he was very young in 1057, when his father and family were recalled into their native country, by their kinſman Edward the Confeſſor, then king thereof. His father died ſoon after his return, before the king had time to give him any eſſential marks of that kindneſs which he profeſſed to him. Edgar was carefully bred up by him, who was his great uncle, and was undoubtedly intended for his ſucceſſor, as the beſt authors aſſure us, and as his title Atheling,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0613800301:298"/>
or Moſt Noble, implies, which is rightly noted by Mr. Selden, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting in this reſpect Polydore Virgil, who miſtook it for a ſirname. But on king Edward's death, Edgar was deprived of his right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his youth, his being born abroad, and his having too little experience for a crowned head in ſuch troubleſome times. Harold, the ſon of Earl Godwin, chiefly through the intrigues of the clergy, was preferred before him, for which they are ſeverely cenſured by ſome writers. This happened in the beginning of A. D. 1066, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold, however, treated him with great reſpect, as long as he lived; after whoſe death and defeat in the fatal battle of Haſtings, the nobles and people in general looked upon Edgar as king, and even acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him as ſuch. But William Duke of Normandy, awing them with his victorious army, was owned and crowned monarch of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, at Weſtminſter, in the ſame year. To him, if we credit ſome of our ancient hiſtorians, Edgar immediately ſubmitted, and was amongſt the number of thoſe, whom William carried with him as hoſtages into Normandy. Other authors are ſilent on this head, but all agree, that in 1067, Edgar, attended by many of the prime nobility, retired firſt into Northumberland, afterwards into Scotland. The perſons who adhered to him, had ſo conſiderable an intereſt both at home and abroad, that they quickly drew together a numerous army, and therewith began to bid fair for unſettling the new eſtabliſhment. In 1068, king William ſent Robert Comyn into the north, in order to expel Edgar and his aſſociates out of thoſe parts, conſtituting him Earl of Northumberland. But this great man had but an ill fate, being ſlain by ſuch forces as he had about him. The next year a great ſucco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r came to theſe malcontents from Denmark, and more Engliſh Lords reconciling themſelves to Edgar, he made head againſt the Normans, and after ſeveral ſucceſsful engagements, made himſelf maſter of the city of York, and wintered between the Ouſe and Trent, notwithſtanding all efforts of the Conqueror. In 1070, he was leſs fortunate. William found means, by money and promiſes, to draw off the Danes and ſome of the Lords of his party, and in the end, obliged him again to retire into Scotland. Malcolm king of that country, married this year his ſiſter Margaret, ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a woman, that in her life-time ſhe was ſtyled the good, and after her deceaſe, was regarded as a ſaint. This marriage enabled Edgar to make new attempts, in which he had moſtly the better, the king of Scots openly aſſiſting him, notwithſtanding king William had demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and threatened to invade Scotland in caſe of refuſal. Some domeſtic troubles hindered that Prince from performing his threat for two years. In 1072, however, king William entered Scotland with
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0613800301:299"/>
an army, but with indifferent ſucceſs. Upon this he readily made peace with Malcolm, and reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lated, according to ancient treaties, the bounds of their reſpective dominions. In this peace, the Scots hiſtorians ſay Edgar Atheling was included, and, on his ſubmiſſion, received into king William's favour, which is very probable, ſince the war was on his account. In 1074 Edgar left Scotland, where he had been ſo kindly entertained, and where his ſiſter was queen. He croſſed the ſea into Normandy, and was kindly received by king William, who gave him a grand allowance. Some of our authors ſay, it was a pound of ſilver a day, others twenty ſhillings. However, he was therewith contented, and lived quietly. William of Malmſbury, his cotemporary (and who expreſsly takes notice that he was living when he wrote), ſpeaks of him in terms little to his advantage. He ſays he behaved meanly and fooliſhly in the king's court, and as an inſtance thereof, mentions his quitting his great allowance for a horſe. But this is not very conſiſtent with the teſtimonies of other authors, or with the general current of hiſtory. After this ſubmiſſion, our hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are ſilent concerning him for many years. This, however, is a plain proof, that he acted like a man of honour towards the Norman, ſince in that ſpace there were many ſtirs, of which he might have made his advantage. In 1086, that is about twelve years after his ſubmiſſion, Edgar conceiving himſelf ill treated at court, retired f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m thence. This does not ſeem to ſpeak him of quite ſo mean a ſpirit as Malmſbury would make him. Certain it is, that even now he had the hearts of the Engliſh nation; ſince in the old Abbey Chronicles, we meet with this prayer on the mention of his retreat, <hi>May the Almighty give him honour,</hi> alluding to the little reſpect ſhewn him at court. But this retreat, however, was not without the king's conſent. On the contrary, Edgar obtained licence to ſail with a certain number of ſhips, and two hundred ſoldiers on board, to Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia. This therefore was no diſgraceful flight, but rather an honourable exile. About the ſame time, his younger ſiſter, Chriſtina, became a nun in Ramſay abbey. How long Edgar continued in Apulia is uncertain; yet, when he returned from thence, he went into Normandy, where he was well received by Duke Robert, who gave him certain lands for his ſubſiſtence. Whether this was done to awe his brother William Rufus, who ſeized the kingdom of England, or purely to provide for an unhappy prince, cannot now be determined. But in 1091, on the concluſion of a ſolemn treaty between the brethren Robert and William, the latter procured Edgar Atheling's being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of his lands; upon which he withdrew out of Normandy, and went into Scotland, to his brother-in-law king Malcolm. In the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0613800301:300"/>
ſame year, this laſt mentioned prince raiſed a puiſſant army, and therewith invaded England, and carried away much ſpoil; on the news whereof both brothers haſtened out of Normandy, and ſent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable force on board tranſports towards the North, that they might more ſpeedily aſſemble an army in thoſe parts; but being near Michaelmas, the weather proved ſtormy, and moſt of the men were loſt. King William II. and Duke Robert, raiſed, however, an army, and though it was winter, advanced therewith towards Scotland. Upon this Edgar interpoſed, reconciled the two kings, and mediated a good peace. For this ſervice he was reſtored to king William's favour, and came back with the brothers to London. However, when Duke Robert returned into Normandy, Edgar choſe to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him, either becauſe he loved him beſt, or feared him leaſt. This was in the beginning of 1092. His ſtay in Normandy was but ſhort, for the next year we find him again in England, attending on, and in favour with, William II. That prince reſided at Glouceſter about Eaſter, and was there ſo ill, that his death was expected. On the 24th of Auguſt, 1093, Malcolm king of Scots, importuned him by letters to regulate certain differences according to treaty, on which William ſummoned him to Glouceſter, and ſent Edgar to conduct him. This he performed; but after all, king William treated Malcolm very ill, who returning into Scotland, levied an army, entered Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, and beſieging the caſtle of Alnwick, which had been unjuſtly taken from him, he was there treacherouſly ſlain, together with his eldeſt ſon Edward. This unfortunate event could not but afflict Edgar exceedingly, eſpecially when he ſaw his nephews deprived of their rights, the Scots ſetting up Donald Bane, <hi>i. e.</hi> Donald the White, whom the Engliſh writers call Dufenald, for their king, who was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Malcolm. Edgar ſent for his five nephews into England, and carefully brought them up; but not without ſome danger to himſelf, if we credit the Scots hiſtorians. One Orgar reported to king William Rufus, that Edgar ſhould ſay boaſtingly to his nephews, that the right to the Engliſh crown was in him and in them. Edgar denied the charge, and was allowed to juſtify himſelf by combat: that is, he choſe a knight to enter into the liſts for him, who was ſo happy as to conquer. Buchanan informs us, that the reaſon he did not fight in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was becauſe Edgar at this time was old and infirm: but in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he was miſtaken, Edgar not exceeding forty-three, and as we ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſee, he went afterwards into Paleſtine. Two of Edgar's nephews died before they were of age, which hindered him from doing what he would otherwiſe have done for them. His third nephew, Edgar, growing towards man's eſtate, and the Scots inviting him when they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0613800301:301"/>
were weary of his uncle, to accept the crown, he reſolved to aſſiſt him in that undertaking. Applying therefore to king William, he procured a ſmall aſſiſtance from him, and therewith marched to the borders of Scotland, where his forces quickly encreaſed, ſo as to enable him to look Donald in the face. It was in the winter of 1097, that he ſet forward on this expedition, and in the next ſpring, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and taken Donald priſoner, he eſtabliſhed his nephew on the throne, and then came back again into England. After this we meet with no account of him, till ſuch time as with Robert the ſon of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, a famous knight, he undertook a journey into the Holy Land. It is probable this was in 1099. He was with Baldwin II. king of Jeruſalem, when beſieged in Rama, and having, in their hazardous ſally, wherein they eſcaped thence, loſt his knight, he thought of returning. This was in 1102, and accordingly he came back ſoon after into Europe, received great civilities from the Greek and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man emperors, who importuned him to remain in their courts, which he civilly excuſed, and continued his journey either into England or Normandy. Henry I. had now aſcended the Engliſh throne, and eſpouſed Maud, Edgar's niece; he had therefore all imaginable reaſon to expect a good reception at court, which, however, he either did not find, or elſe, it may be, declined. For we are certain, that he was ſome ſhort time after his return from the Eaſt, in Normandy, with Duke Robert, for whom he had a great kindneſs. He even remained firm in his friendſhip to him, when king Henry invaded his dominions, and was taken priſoner fighting in his cauſe, as alſo was Duke Robert himſelf, at the fatal battle of Tenchebray, wherein the whole force of Normandy was routed; which fell out in the latter end of 1106. King Henry dealt very ſeverely with the reſt of the priſoners; but as for Edgar, he diſmiſſed him freely. This is the laſt time he is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in our hiſtories, and after his return into England, he went to paſs the remainder of his days in the country; where, according to Malmſbury, he was living in 1120, when he muſt have been ſeventy or thereabouts. In what year he died, appears not, nor do we read that he was ever married. He was born during his father's exile, loſt him when his life would have ſecured him a crown, ſtruggled, though to no purpoſe, againſt the Conqueror, was through his whole life, the ſport of fortune, and died full of years in a dark obſcurity. To which we add, that till now, his life was never written, from a ſuppoſed want of materials, and from a real want of inclination, to glean from our ancient hiſtorians, a multitude of little memorandums, concerning an injured unfortunate prince. This juſtice we have at
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0613800301:302"/>
length done to his memory, and the Engliſh Hiſtory; which, from this article, we hope will not appear quite ſo barren, as ſome modern writers would repreſent it.</p>

            <head>ATTERBURY (FRANCIS),</head>
            <p>BISHOP of Rocheſter in the reigns of Queen Anne and king George I. was born the 6th of March, 1662, at Middleton, or Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Keynes, near Newport-Pagnel, in Buckinghamſhire. He had his education in grammar learning at Weſtminſter School: and from thence, in 1680, was elected a ſtudent of Chriſt-Church college in Oxford: where he ſoon diſtinguiſhed himſelf for the politeneſs of his wit and learning; and gave early proofs of his poetical talents, in a latin verſion of Mr. Dryden's <hi>Abſalom and Achitophel,</hi> An Epigram on a <hi>Lady's Fan</hi>; and a Tranſlation of two <hi>Odes of Horace.</hi> He took the degree of Bachelor of Arts, June the thirteenth, 1684; and that of Maſter, April the twentieth, 1687. This year he made his firſt eſſay in controverſial writing, in a piece, entitled, <hi>An Anſwer to ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations on the Spirit of Martin Luther, and the Original of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> During his ſtay in the univerſity, he is generally thought to have borne no inconſiderable part in the famous controverſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Dr. Bentley, and the Honourable Mr. Charles Boyle (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Earl of Orrery), concerning the genuineneſs of <hi>Phalaris's Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi>; though Mr. Atterbury's name was not made uſe of on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. At what time he entered into holy orders, is not certainly known: but, in 1693, upon the death of his father, he made appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Earl of Nottingham, to ſucceed in the rectory of Milton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he then called the height of his ambition and wiſhes, as being the place of his birth. But, being diſappointed in his expectation of this preferment, and long ſince tired of a college life, Mr. Atterbury reſolved to quit the univerſity, and produce himſelf on a more active ſtage: and accordingly, making London his reſidence, he ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed himſelf in ſuch a manner, that he was appointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to King William and Queen Mary, and was elected preacher at Bridewell, and Lecturer of St. Bride's. In 1694, our young divine preached a remarkable ſermon at Bridewell chapel, before the governors of that and Bethlehem hoſpital, on <hi>the Power of Charity to cover Sin</hi>; to which Mr. Benjamin Hoadly (ſince biſhop of Wincheſter) publiſhed ſome <hi>Exceptions.</hi> The ſame year he was warmly attacked for his ſermon, preached before the Queen at Whitehall; entitled, <hi>The Scorner incapable of True Wiſdom.</hi> But the largeſt field of controverſy, in which he ever engaged, was that which opened it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0613800301:303"/>
in the year 1700, and continued four years, between him, Dr. Wake (afterwards archbiſhop of Canterbury), and others, concerning <hi>the Rights Powers, and Privileges of Convocations:</hi> in which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the truth of the queſtion may be ſuppoſed to lie, he diſplayed ſo much learning and ingenuity, as well as zeal for the intereſts of his order, that the Lower Houſe of Convocation returned him their thanks, and the univerſity of Oxford complimented him with the degree of Doctor in Divinity. January the twenty-ninth, 1700, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled Archdeacon of Totneſs, being promoted to that dignity by Sir Jonathan Trelawny, then biſhop of Exeter. The ſame year he was engaged with ſome other learned divines, in reviſing an intended edition of the Greek Teſtament, with Greek Scholia, collected chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the fathers, by Mr. Archdeacon Gregory. Upon the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Queen Anne, in 1702, Dr. Atterbury was appointed one of her Majeſty's chaplains in ordinary; and, in October, 1704, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the deanery of Carliſle. About two years after this, he was engaged in a diſpute with Mr. Hoadly, concerning the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of <hi>Virtue</hi> with regard to the <hi>preſent</hi> life, occaſioned by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, preached the thirtieth of Auguſt, 1706, at the funeral of Mr. Thomas Bennet, a bookſeller. In 1707, Sir Jonathan Trelawny, then biſhop of Exeter, appointed him one of the canons reſidentiaries of that church; and, in 1709, Sir John Trevor, a great diſcerner of men and their abilities, was ſo ſtruck with his fame, and charmed with his eloquence, that he made him preacher of the Rolls chapel. This year he was engaged in a freſh diſpute with Mr. Hoadly, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſive obedience, occaſioned by his Latin ſermon, entitled <hi>Concio ad Clerum Londinenſem habita in Eccleſia S. Elphegi.</hi> In 1710, came on the famous trial of Dr. Sacheverell, whoſe remarkable ſpeech on that occaſion, was generally ſuppoſed to have been drawn up by our author, in conjunction with Dr. Smaldridge and Dr. Friend. The ſame year Dr. Atterbury was unanimouſly choſen Prolocutor of the Lower Houſe of Convocation, and had the chief management of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in that houſe. The eleventh of May 1711, he was appointed by the convocation, one of the committee for comparing Mr. Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's doctrines with thoſe of the Church of England; and, in June following, he had the chief hand in drawing up <hi>A Repreſentation of the preſent State of Religion.</hi> In 1712, Dr. Atterbury was made Dean of Chriſt-Church, notwithſtanding the ſtrong intereſt and warm appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſeveral great men, in behalf of his competitor Dr. Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge. The next year ſaw him at the top of his preferment, as well as of his reputation: for in the beginning of June, 1713, the Queen, at the recommendation of the Earl of Oxford, advanced him to the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0613800301:304"/>
biſhopric of Rocheſter, and deanery of Weſtminſter; and he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated at Lambeth the 4th of July following. It is ſaid, he had in view the primacy of all England; and that his credit with the Queen and miniſtry was ſo conſiderable, and his ſchemes ſo well laid, as probably to have carried it, upon a vacancy, had not her Majeſty's death, in Auguſt 1714, prevented him. At the beginning of the ſucceeding reign, his tide of proſperity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to turn; and he received a ſenſible mortification preſently after the coronation of King George I. when, upon his offering to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his Majeſty (with a view, no doubt, of ſtanding better in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) with the chair of ſtate and royal canopy, his own perquiſites, as Dean of Weſtminſter, the offer was rejected, not without ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marks of diſlike to his perſon. During the rebellion in Scotland, which broke out in the firſt year of this reign, Biſhop Atterbury gave an inſtance of his growing diſaffection to the eſtabliſhed government, in refuſing to ſign the Declaration of the biſhops. Beſides which, he conſtantly oppoſed the meaſures of the Court in the Houſe of Lords, and drew up ſome of the moſt violent proteſts with his own hand. Thus he went on till the year 1722, when the government having reaſon to ſuſpect him of being concerned in a plot in favour of the Pretender; he was accordingly apprehended on the twenty-fourth of Auguſt, and committed priſoner to the Tower. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment of a biſhop, upon a ſuſpicion of high treaſon, as it was a thing rarely practiſed ſince the reformation, ſo it occaſioned various ſpeculations among the people. On the twenty-third of March, 1722-3, a bill was brought into the Houſe of Commons, for <hi>inflicting certain pains and penalties on Francis, Lord Biſhop of Rocheſter</hi>; a copy of which was ſent to him, with notice that he had liberty of counſel, and ſolicitors for making his defence. Under theſe circumſtances, the biſhop applied by petition to the Houſe of Lords, for their direction and advice, as to his conduct in this conjuncture; and, on the 4th of April, he acquainted the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, by a letter, that he was determined to give that Houſe no trouble, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the bill depending therein; but ſhould be ready to make his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt it, when it ſhould be argued in another Houſe, of which he had the honour to be a member. On the 9th, the bill paſſed the Houſe of Commons, and was the ſame day ſent up to the Houſe of Lords for their concurrence. On the 6th of May, being the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Lords for the firſt reading of the bill, Biſhop Atterbury was brought to Weſtminſter, to make his defence. The counſel for the Biſhop were, Sir Conſtantine Phipps, and William Wynne, Eſq. for the king, Mr. Reeve and Mr. Wearg. The proceedings continued
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0613800301:305"/>
above a week; and on Saturday May the eleventh, the Biſhop was permitted to plead for himſelf; which he did in a very eloquent ſpeech. On Monday the thirteenth, he was carried, for the laſt time, from the Tower, to hear the reply of the king's counſel to his defence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On the fifteenth, the bill was read the third time; and, after a very long and warm debate, paſſed on the ſixteenth, by a majority of eighty-th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee to forty-three. On the twenty-ſeventh the king came to the Houſe, and confirmed it by his royal aſſent. It is ſaid, his Majeſty paſſed the bill with ſome regret, being much concerned, as he expreſſed it, that there ſhould be juſt cauſe of dooming to perpetual baniſhment a biſhop of the Church of England, and a man of ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts and learning. To alleviate, however, in ſome meaſure, the ſeverity of this ſentence, the Biſhop's daughter, Mrs. Morrice, was permitted to attend her father in his travels: and his ſon-in-law, Mr. Morrice, by virtue of his Majeſty's ſign manual, had leave to correſpond with him. On the eighteenth of June 1723, this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent prelate, having the day before taken leave of his friends, who, from the time of paſſing the bill againſt him, to the day of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had free acceſs to him in the Tower, embarked on board the Aldborough man of war, and landed the Friday following at Calais. From thence he went to Bruſſels; and afterwards to Paris, where he reſided till his death; ſoftening the rigours of his exile by ſtudy, and converſation with learned men; and by a conſtant epiſtolary corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the moſt eminent ſcholars, particularly with M. Thiriot, an ingenious French gentleman, for whom he had a great eſteem, and who has obliged the public with ſome of the biſhop's original letters, which are chiefly <hi>Critiques</hi> on ſeveral French authors. Biſhop Atter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury died at Paris the fifteenth of February, 1731. His body was brought over to England, and interred the twelfth of May following, in Weſtminſter Abbey. Some time before his death, he publiſhed a vindication of himſelf, Biſhop Smaldridge, and Dr. Aldrich, from a charge brought againſt them by Mr. Oldmixon, of having altered and interpolated the copy of Lord Clarendon's Hiſtory of the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Biſhop Atterbury's Sermons are extant in four volumes in octavo: thoſe contained in the two firſt were publiſhed by himſelf, and dedicated to his great patron Sir Jonathan Trelawny, biſhop of Wincheſter; thoſe in the two laſt were publiſhed after his death, by Dr. Thomas Moore, his Lordſhip's chaplain. His epiſtolary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Mr. Pope, is extant in the collection of that poet's letters. As to Biſhop Atterbury's character, however, the moral and political part of it may have been differently repreſented by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite

In January following, the king appointed him lord chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; and ſoon after granted him the ſcite of the priory of Chriſt Church near Aldgate, now called Duke's Place, with all the church-plate and lands belonging to that houſe. In this high office he was as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the king's buſineſs, as he had been when ſpeaker of the houſe of commons; for in July 1535, he ſat in judgment, and pronounced ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death upon Sir Thomas Moore, indicted of high treaſon, for refuſing to acknowledge the king's ſupremacy in the church. When ſentence was paſt, Sir Thomas ſaid, that he had for ſeven years bent his mind and ſtudy upon this cauſe, but as yet he found it no where writ by any approved doctor of the church, that a layman could be head of the eccleſiaſtical ſtate. To which Audley returned, 'Sir, will you be reckoned wiſer, or of a better conſcience, than all the biſhops, the nobility, and the whole kingdom?'</p>
            <p>As Audley had been very active in the buſineſs of the divorce, ſo he had a large hand in the proceedings previous to the diſſolution of ſuch religious houſes as had not two hundred pounds by the year.

Audley offered the abbot of Athelny a hundred marks per annum penſion, which he refuſed, as too ſmall a ſum. With the abbot of St. Oſithes in Eſſex, he was more ſucceſsful: in a

An upon making application for the great abbey of Walden in Eſſex, which with ſome difficulty he obtained, he extenuated its worth, and alleged that it would be but a reaſonable recompence for the great damage and infamy he had ſuffered in ſerving the king.</p>
            <p>On the twenty-ninth of November, 1538, he was created baron Audley, of Walden in Eſſex, and inſtalled knight of the garter. A little before his death he obtained from the king, a licence to change the name of Buckingham college in Cambridge, into that of Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, or Maudlin. To this college he was a great benefactor, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it his own arms, and is generally reputed its founder. He died on the laſt of April, 1544 (having held the ſeals upwards of twelve years), and in the fifty-ſixth year of his life, as appears by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on his tomb. Mr. Rapin ſays he was a man of ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was ſerviceable to the reformers, whenever he could be ſo, without any hazard or danger to himſelf; but was too much a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to inſiſt even upon what he judged reaſonable, if diſapproved of by the king. Lloyd ſays, that he was always in favour with the queen, who had no leſs intereſt in the king's heart, than the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had in his head; and that he knew king Henry's temper bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than himſelf, whom he ſurpriſed always to his own bent, never moving any of his ſuits to him, but when in haſte, and moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amuſing him with other matter until he paſſed his requeſt.</p>
            <p>By his lady Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Grey, Marquis of Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, he had two daughters, Margaret and Mary. The latter dying unmarried, Margaret became his ſole heir, and married firſt, Lord Henry Dudley, a younger ſon of John Duke of Northumberland, and afterwards Thomas Duke of Norfolk, by whom ſhe had a ſon Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, who, by act of parliament, 27 Eliz. was reſtored in blood; and in the 39th of the ſame reign was ſummoned to parliament by his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's title, as baron of Walden. In the firſt of king James I. he was created Earl of Suffolk, and afterwards lord high treaſurer of England.

            <p>THE firſt archbiſhop of Canterbury, was originally a monk in the convent of St. Andrew at Rome, and educated under St. Gregory, afterwards pope Gregory I. by whom he was diſpatched into Britain,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0613800301:310"/>
with forty other monks of the ſame order, about the year 596, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Engliſh Saxons to Chriſtianity. They landed in the iſle of Thanet, and having ſent ſome French interpreters to king Ethelbert with an account of their errand, the king gave them leave to convert as many of his ſubjects as they could, and aſſigned their place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at Dorovernum, ſince called Canterbury, to which they were confined till the king himſelf was converted, whoſe example had a powerful influence in promoting the converſion of his ſubjects, but though he was extremely pleaſed at their becoming Chriſtians, he never attempted to compel them. He had learned (ſays the venerable Bede) from his inſtructors in the way of ſalvation, that force and dragooning was not the method of the Goſpel; that the religion of Jeſus Chriſt was to make its way by argument and perſuaſion, to be matter of choice and not of compulſion. Auguſtin, by direction of the pope, went afterwards to Arles in France, where he was conſecrated arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop and metropolitan of the Engliſh nation, by the archbiſhop of that place. On his return to Britain, he diſpatched a prieſt and a monk to Rome, to acquaint the pope with the ſucceſs of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and to deſire his reſolution of certain queſtions. Theſe men brought back with them a pall, and ſeveral books, veſtments, utenſils, and ornaments for the churches. His holineſs, by the ſame meſſengers, gave Auguſtin directions concerning the ſettling of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ſees in Britain, and ordered him not to pull down the idol temples, but to convert them into Chriſtian churches, only deſtroying the idols, and ſprinkling the place with holy water, that the natives, by frequenting the temples they had been always accuſtomed to, might be the leſs ſhocked at their entrance into Chriſtianity. And whereas it had been their cuſtom to ſacrifice oxen to their falſe gods, he adviſed, that upon the anniverſary of each church's conſecration, the people ſhould erect booths round about, and feaſt therein, not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing their oxen to devils, but killing them for their own refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and praiſing God for the bleſſing. He further cautioned him not to be puffed up with the miracles he was enabled to work in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his miniſtry; but to conſider how much the Engliſh were the favourites of heaven, ſince God enabled him to alter the courſe of nature to promote their converſion.</p>
            <p>Auguſtin fixed his ſee at Canterbury, and being ſupported by the intereſt of king Ethelbert, made an attempt to ſettle a correſpondence with the Britiſh biſhops, and to bring them to conformity with the Roman church. To this purpoſe a conference was held at a place in Worceſterſhire, ſince called Auguſtin's oak, but without ſucceſs. A ſecond conference was propoſed, at which the appearance was more numerous than at the former, ſeven Britiſh biſhops, attending at it,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0613800301:311"/>
with a great many learned monks from the monaſtery of Bancorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, or Bangor, who were under the direction of their abbot Dinoth. Theſe Britons, before they began their journey, applied to a certain hermit of eminent virtue and good ſenſe, to know whether or not they ſhould give up the uſages and traditions of their church, and acknowledge the pretenſions of Auguſtine. He told them, that if Auguſtine ſhould prove to be a man of God, they ought to be governed by him. They aſked him how they ſhould know this. The hermit replied,
<q rend="inline">'Our Saviour ſays, "Take my yoke upon you, for I am meek and low in heart." If Auguſtin be affable and humble, he has probably taken Chriſt's yoke upon him, and offers you the ſame privilege: but if he be haughty and inſolent, it is plain he is not commiſſioned from heaven, nor are his words to be regarded.'</q>
The father aſked, by what marks they were to diſcover his temper. The hermit deſired them to manage it ſo, that Auguſtin and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould be firſt at the place, and if he roſe to ſalute them at their coming in, they might conclude he was ſent from God; but if he neglected this civility, they might return his contempt, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with him. When the Britons came into the ſynod Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin received them ſitting; in reſentment of which affront they warmly oppoſed every thing he offered. The articles inſiſted on by Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin were, that they ſhould celebrate Eaſter, and adminiſter baptiſm, according to the practice of the Romiſh church; and that they ſhould acknowledge the Pope's authority: if they would comply in theſe reſpects, and aſſiſt in the converſion of the Saxons, he would bear with the diſagreement of their cuſtoms in other caſes. But the Britons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, they could yield none of the points conteſted.</p>
            <p>This apoſtle of the Engliſh died at Canterbury in the year 604. The popiſh writers aſcribe ſeveral miracles to him.

            <p>A colonel in the ſervice of the long parliament, and executed for the ſhare he had in the murder of King Charles I. The particulars of this gentleman's life, before he engaged in the ſervice of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, are ſo deeply buried in oblivion, that, notwithſtanding all the induſtry we have uſed, a very few only, and thoſe of leſs conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than we could wiſh, can be brought to light. He was of a good family, and had a tolerable education, that is to ſay, ſuch a one as might fit him for the courſe of life it was intended he ſhould lead,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0613800301:312"/>
being placed by his relations as an apprentice to a grocer in Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſtreet. As he was of a very ſerious diſpoſition, and had been very early tinctured with thoſe principles, which were in that age ſtyled puritanical, he became an eager follower of ſuch miniſters as diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their zealous preaching. His great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to theſe ſort of people, and the natural warmth of his own temper, were the occaſions of his quitting his own calling, and going into the army, to which he was principally determined, by keeping a day of faſting and prayer with Mr. Simeon Aſh, Mr. Love, Mr. Woodcocke, and other miniſters in Lawrence-lane, wherein, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his judgment, they did ſo clearly ſtate the cauſe of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he was fully convinced of the juſtice of their cauſe, and reſolved to venture his life for it. Such were the conſequences of the profeſſors of the Chriſtian religion, converting their pulpits into ſchools of politics, to which it may truly be ſaid, the civil wars owed its beginning, as moſt of the diſmal conſequences with which it was attended, flowed but too apparently from the ſame ſource. After having thus choſen his party, he behaved in the army with ſo much zeal, courage, and conduct, that he roſe by degrees to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral commands, of Captain, Major, and Lieutenant Colonel, in a regiment of foot. It was in this laſt capacity, that he acted with great vehemence againſt all endeavours for a reconciliation with the King, and particularly concurred in exhibiting a charge of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, againſt eleven members of the Houſe of Commons, for betraying the cauſe of the Parliament, endeavouring to break and deſtroy the army, with other particulars, which obliged thoſe gentlemen to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, which was the firſt force put upon that houſe of commons, and the remembrance of the concern C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon ſeveral changes that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards happened, theſe members were again admitted, ſat and voted in the houſe, and new ſchemes were entered upon, for reſtoring the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution by ſettling the government, in order to which the houſe of commons, on the fifth of December, 1648, reſolved,

But a great party in the army who thought otherwiſe, determined to prevent the effects of this; and accordingly placed one Colonel Pride with a guard at the door of the parliament houſe, having in his hands a liſt of thoſe members who were to be excluded. Accordingly he prevented all of them from entering the houſe, and ſecured ſome of them who were moſt ſuſpected, under a guard provided for that purpoſe; which act of his was ſuppoſed,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0613800301:313"/>
by ſome of the wiſeſt men in England, to diſſolve and deſtroy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the Commons of England, and to leave thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained and acted, without any legal authority. Yet this remnant of the Houſe of Commons, on the thirteenth of December, revived the vote of non-addreſſes, and though they were but twenty-ſix in number, took upon them to iſſue a commiſſion for trying the King, paſſing a vote on New-year's day, <hi>That it was treaſon in the King, to levy war againſt the Parliament.</hi> On the ninth of January, the trial of the King was proclaimed by ſound of trumpet, and beat of drum, in Weſtminſter-Hall, at the Old Exchange, and in Cheapſide; and all people were ſummoned who had any thing to ſay againſt the King, to appear and be heard. On the twentieth of January, when the King was brought before the High Court of Juſtice, Colonel Stubberd, and Colonel Axtel, had the command of the ſoldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtairs. The King demanded of Serjeant Bradſhaw, who was the Preſident, by what authority they brought him there? And the Preſident appealing to the charge, which was in the name of the Commons and People of England, Lady Fairfax, the General's wife, cried out, <hi>It is a lie, it is falſe, not a half, not a quarter of the people,</hi> Oliver Cromwell <hi>is a rogue and a traitor</hi>; which words were repeated by Mrs. Nelſon. Upon this Colonel Axtel cried out, <hi>Down with the whores, ſhoot them</hi>; which vehemence of his made him be taken notice of. The people, at the time of his Majeſty's paſſing to his trial, moved by the ſadneſs of the ſight, cried out, <hi>God ſave the KING!</hi> which obliged ſuch as drove on his death, to procure another cry to countenance their deſign, and therefore Colonel Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel beat the ſoldiers till they cried, <hi>Juſtice! Juſtice!</hi> And on the laſt day of the trial, when the common people cried, <hi>God preſerve your Majeſty!</hi> the ſoldiers were again taught, by the prevailing argument of the cane, to cry out, <hi>Execution! Execution!</hi> After the ſentence was paſſed, the King was carried through the middle of King-ſtreet, in a common ſedan, by two porters, who, out of reverence to his perſon, went bare-headed, till the ſoldiers, under Colonel Axtel's command, beat them, and forced them to put on their hats. After the murder of the King, when Cromwell was ſent into Ireland, the regiment in which Colonel Axtel ſerved, was drawn out by lot for that expedition, which occaſioned his going over into that kingdom, where he made a conſiderable figure, was much eſteemed and truſted by Cromwell, and raiſed, for his fidelity, courage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as General Ludlow tells us, to the command of a regiment, and the government of Kilkenny and the adjacent precinct, which important truſt, Ludlow farther tells us, he diſcharged with diligence
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0613800301:314"/>
and ſucceſs, and in his ſtation ſhewed a more than ordinary zeal in puniſhing thoſe Iriſh who had been guilty of murdering the Proteſtants. Other writers repreſent this in quite a different light, and charge him with ſeverities, not at all inferior in cruelty to thoſe committed by the Iriſh rebels themſelves. After Cromwell, on the twentieth of April, 1653, had turned the Long Parliament out of the Houſe, things took another turn; and he having aſſumed the ſupreme power to himſelf, ſent over his ſon, Henry, to Ireland, where he commanded at firſt as Major-General, and by his endeavours to eſtabliſh the new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo diſguſted all the godly, but more particularly the Anabaptiſts, that on the twenty-eighth of November, 1656, they ſent Major Jones, and one Mr. Doyley, to acquaint him, that Quarter-Maſter-General Vernon, Adjutant Allen, Colonel Barrowe, and Colonel Axtel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſpeak with him; upon which he offered to confer with them immediately. As ſoon as they came into his preſence, Colonel Barrowe, premiſing his and their many perſonal obligations received from the Major-General, told him, that finding themſelves of late not made uſe of, they could not, with ſatisfaction to their conſciences, receive pay from the public, without doing ſervice for it, and, therefore, came to acquaint him, that they had, upon ſolemn ſeeking of God, and ſerious deliberation with themſelves, repreſented to his Highneſs and the Lord Deputy, their reſolutions to quit their commands, and had ſent their reaſons for doing it; ſignifying that they had reſerved the delivering up of their commiſſions to the Major-General, as a particular mark of their reſpect for him; wherefore he did, in his own, and in the name of the reſt of the officers, declare, that they were from thenceforward diſcharged from any public employment in the army; and at the ſame time they all of them tendered their commiſſions, which the Major-General however did not think fit to accept; but they having publicly declared, that they looked upon their offer as a ſufficient diſcharge, he thought fit to appoint them another meeting, the next day, in the afternoon. He told them at this meeting, that he was very ſorry to find they were ſo reſolute in what they propoſed the day before, as to giving up their commiſſions, and that it was no pleaſant thing to him to receive them from perſons who had ſo long ſerved the public as they had done. If they quitted indeed upon a conſcientious diſſatisfaction, he knew not well what to reply, but that he hoped, when he parted with them the day before, that they would have given him time to have reaſoned the matter with them, and not have put him upon giving ſo ſudden an anſwer. But ſince conſidering how poſitive they had been, and that they had, contrary to his expectation, and that not in ſo decent a manner as he could have wiſhed, made it the talk of the town, he thought himſelf concerned forthwith to declare his acceptance
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0613800301:315"/>
of their propoſal; and that he ſhould take care, ſince they inſiſted ſo earneſtly upon it, without any provocation of his, and contrary to his deſires, they ſhould be fairly diſcharged the army, and ſatisfied what was due to each of them; and that ſince they were reſolved to retire, he ſhould wiſh them well in their private capacities, and ſhew them all reſpect befitting the place he ſtood in there; and hoped that they would mind the promiſe they made the day before, of ſerving God, and being always ready to ſerve the public in order thereto. Upon this they ſeemed to expreſs great thankfulneſs, and very high ſatisfaction in the choice they had made; only Colonel Axtel having firſt premiſed, that he thought himſelf now on a level with the Major-General, complained in very rough and bitter language of the ill uſage he had met with, and the ſlights that had been put upon him ſince the great Revolution in England, and the power of the Parliament had been devolved upon a ſingle perſon, which Mr. Cromwell bore as patiently as he could; but it appears clearly enough from the letters he wrote to Secretary Thurloe, that he was extremely ſenſible of the uſage he had met with, and looked upon theſe people, as abſolutely diſaffected both to the government in general, and to his family in particular. The condition of Colonel Axtel from this time was very unpleaſant. He lived in a private condition upon the eſtate he had acquired in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but inſtead of that power and authority which he had exerciſed for ſix years together over the town and diſtrict of Kilkenny, he was now in the ſtate of a diſaffected man, and not only without truſt and without authority, but alſo ſo much ſuſpected by his ſuperiors, that he could not take the ſlighteſt journey about his private affairs, without having ſpies ſet over him, and being frequently called to account. All this was occaſioned by the wild principles and reſtleſs ſpirits of the Anabaptiſts, which as they had brought about the ſubverſion, firſt of one government, and then of another, were now grown as turbulent under a third. Yet Henry Cromwell, when veſted with the character of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, was contented to watch over them without perſecuting them; and, except the great jealouſy that he expreſſed of their motions, he kept his word with them very exactly, and treated them as well as they could expect. After the death of the Protector, Oliver, which happened on the third of September, 1658, things took a new turn, and his ſon Richard, who had aſſumed the title of Protector, immediately after his father's death, ſaw himſelf, in the beginning of the next year, reduced to the fatal neceſſity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, what he called a Parliament, with which ended his authority; and on the ſeventh of May, 1659, the remnant of the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſumed the power of which they had been deprived by Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well; and his ſon Henry, who commanded as Lord Lieutenant in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0613800301:316"/>
Ireland, having ſubmitted, as well as his brother Richard, Lieutenant-General Edmund Ludlow was ſent over to take the ſupreme authority there, and one of the firſt things he did, being to new-model the army, Colonel Axtel came again into play, had a regiment given him, and was one of the few perſons, in whom Ludlow chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided. It may not be amiſs to remark, that though this gentleman changed his opinion with reſpect to church matters, and of a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian became an Anabaptiſt, yet, as to his notions of civil government he remained ſomewhat more ſteady, and was always looked upon as a zealous friend to a commonwealth. It was this diſpoſition of his, and his clear reputation for courage and conduct, as an officer, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced General Ludlow to make choice of him, to command one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Iriſh brigade, that was ſent over to maintain the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in poſſeſſion of their authority, and to keep out the king, which however they were ſo far from doing, that they contributed very much to his return. The riſing of Sir George Booth, which happened in Auguſt the ſame year, was the occaſion of their being tranſported to England; but they had no ſhare in reducing him, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before their arrival, by Major-General Lambert. Their coming, however, was eſteemed of great ſervice to the parliament, though it proved otherwiſe; for Colonel Zanchy, who commanded them, concurred with the army in putting a new force upon that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, which laſted till Chriſtmas, and then the Rum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as it was called, was again reſtored by the terror of Monk's army, which was marching out of Scotland. As he at the beginning declared poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively for the Parliament, Colonel Axtel, and the reſt of the officers of the Iriſh brigade, kept that body of troops which were eſteemed the beſt in the kingdom, from acting againſt him, which if they had done in conjunction with Lambert, his deſign in all probability had miſcarried. But as Monk very well knew that thoſe forces would never concur in reſtoring the king, while under the officers who then commanded them, he reſolved to try whether it might not be poſſible, to engage them firſt to change their officers, and then to fall into his meaſures, which was the moſt critical point he had to manage. They were at that time quartered in Yorkſhire, and thither he ſent Colonel Redman, who commanded part of thoſe troops in Ireland, under Henry Cromwell, and who was turned out by Ludlow. He carried with him ſome of his friends who had ſerved under him, and on his firſt appearance, the beſt part of the Iriſh brigade very fairly told Colonel Zanchy, and Colonel Axtel, that they might take what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they thought fit, but for themſelves, they were determined to ſerve under Colonel Redman, and their old officers. This revolt gave
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0613800301:317"/>
the death's wound to the republic; for Colonel Redman, purſuant to the orders he had received from General Monk, immediately march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that body of old troops into Cheſhire, which ſo weakened Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's army, that was before ſuperior to Monk's, that it left him in no condition to oppoſe the march of that general to London, which Colonel Axtel perceiving, reſolved to ſhift for himſelf, and being thenceforward deprived of all command, endeavoured to ſettle his private affairs, and ſecure himſelf the beſt way he could. But when a freſh opportunity offered of aſſerting the good old cauſe, Colonel Axtel ſhewed his affection to it, by venturing his life in a very deſperate undertaking, and that too as a private man. The occaſion was this: the Council of State had committed General Lambert to the Tower, in the beginning of the month of March; but on the ninth of April 1660, he made his eſcape from thence, and got down as far as Daventry in Northamptonſhire, where, having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a conſiderable body of horſe, he was joined by Colonel Okey, Colonel Axtel, Colonel Cobbet, Lieutenant Colonel Young, Major Creed, Captain Timothy Clare, Captain Gregory, Captain Spinage, beſides divers ſoldiers that were Anabaptiſts. Colonel Richard Ingoldſby, and Colonel Streater, who were ſent to reduce Lambert, followed him with ſuch diligence, that on Eaſter-day, which was on that year on the twenty-ſecond of April, they came up with him in a plain near Daventry, having only a brook between them. When the two bodies came near, juſt as Colonel Ingoldſby was going to charge, Streater commanded ſix files of muſqueteers to advance. One file gave fire, and hurt one or two of Lambert's horſe. His drums beat, and in good order he advanced, having given ſtrict command, that his muſqueteers ſhould not fire, till they came as near as puſh of pike. But Lambert's men held the noſes of their piſtols towards the ground, and Nelthorp's troop came off to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goldſby, Haſlerigg's troop having deſerted him before. For Colonel Ingoldſby ſending Captain Elſemore before him with a party, as he marched to find Lambert, met Captain Haſlerigg, and took him priſoner, but releaſed him upon his parole, to ſend his whole troop over to join Ingoldſby, which he faithfully performed, ſending it to them by his quarter-maſter; but he retired himſelf. Colonel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goldſby told Lambert he was his priſoner; whereupon Creed and the reſt earneſtly intreated him to do what he pleaſed with them, but to let Lambert eſcape, acquainting him that his life could be of no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him; which Ingoldſby abſolutely refuſed, telling them, that he would not be treacherous to thoſe that had commanded him, by ſuch an ungenerous act. Lambert then turned about his horſe, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0613800301:318"/>
to make his eſcape; but Ingoldſby purſued him ſo cloſe, that he came quickly up to him, and vowed to piſtol him if he did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately yield. Lambert, in great depreſſion of ſpirits, twice prayed him to let him eſcape; but when he ſaw he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, ſubmitted as well as the reſt did, except Okey, Axtel, and Clare, who eſcaped. This was the laſt ſtruggle that was made in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Commonwealth; and Axtel uſed his utmoſt induſtry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to conceal himſelf, as foreſeeing that it would not be long before he might be called to an account, for the large ſhare he had taken in the trial of the king: but his care in this reſpect was to very little purpoſe, for before the cloſe of the month, he was diſcovered and committed to priſon. We are told by one of his friends, that he was betrayed by a royaliſt, who having engaged him to a meeting, on pretence of treating with him for the purchaſe of ſome lands, gave notice of the time and place, by which he was apprehended and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower. After the King's Reſtoration, the bill of indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity being then depending in the Houſe of Commons, they, on the fourteenth of June, 1660, reſolved, <hi>That</hi> Daniel Axtel <hi>ſhould be one of the</hi> Twenty <hi>excepted out of that bill.</hi> On the twelfth of July fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, a warrant was ſent for his detention in the Tower, for high treaſon. On the twenty-ninth of Auguſt, the King paſſed the ſo long expected act, of free and general pardon, out of which only two and fifty perſons were excepted, of which Colonel Daniel Axtel was the fiftieth, as alſo the two perſons diſguiſed in frocks and vizors, who appeared upon the ſcaffold at the murder of King Charles I. which perſons were left to be proceeded againſt as traitors, according to the laws of England. On the tenth of October follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the grand jury for the county of Middleſex, having found bills againſt twenty-eight perſons, for their concern in the king's murder, of which Mr. Axtel was the laſt, they were brought to the ſeſſions houſe in the Old Bailey, where Colonel Axtel was the ſame day arraigned, upon an indictment for compaſſing and imagining the death of the late King; when for ſome time he refuſed to plead, alleging that what he had done was in purſuance of an Act of Parliament, and therefore he conceived no inferior court ought to judge of it; to which point he deſired he might have counſel aſſigned. But the Court having reaſoned with him, and told him, that in caſe of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it was the ſame thing to ſtand mute, as to confeſs the indictment he was prevailed upon to plead Not Guilty. When he was aſked How he would be tried? and told that the proper anſwer was, By God and his country; he ſaid that was not lawful, <hi>God not being locally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:</hi> however, he ſoon after made the uſual anſwer, and put himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:0613800301:319"/>
upon his trial. This did not come on till the 15th of October, 1660, when, after challenging ten of the jury, the indictment was opened, in which the Counſel for the Crown obſerved, That the High Court erected for the trial of the late King, had all the formalities of a court, ſuch as their Preſident, their Council, their Chaplain, and Guards; and as ſome of their Judges, one of their Counſel, and their Chaplain had been already tried, they had now brought this gentleman to the bar, as the Commander of the Guard, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to call their evidence. Mr. Holland Simpſon proved, that Colonel Axtel had the command of the ſoldiers below ſtairs, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to ſhoot Lady Fairfax for diſturbing the Court. Colonel Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules Huncks depoſed, that on the day the King died, himſelf, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Phayre, Colonel Hacker, and Cromwell, being in a room together, Cromwell deſired him to ſign a warrant for the King's execution; which he having refuſed to do, and Cromwell having given him ſome harſh language on that account, Mr. Axtel ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Colonel Huncks, I am aſhamed of you, the ſhip is now coming into the harbour, and will you ſtrike ſail before we come to an anchor.'</q>
Mr. Axtel poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively denied this, and told Colonel Huncks, that himſelf was named in the warrant for execution, and that he wiſhed he did not make others a peace-offering to ſave himſelf. Sir Purbeck Temple ſwore, That Mr. Axtel beat the ſoldiers to make them cry, <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi> That he laughed and ſcoffed with them during the trial, and that he ſuffered, and, as the witneſs believed, procured the ſoldiers to fire powder in the palms of their hands, which threw ſuch clouds of ſmoke into the King's face, that he was obliged to riſe out of his chair, and beat it off with his hand. Mr. John Jeonar, who was one of the King's domeſtic ſervants, and attended him at the trial, gave poſitive evidence, that when the Court broke up the firſt day, Colonel Axtel ordered the Guards to cry, <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice!</hi> and the laſt day, <hi>Execution, Execution!</hi> And he farther depoſed, that being very near the Colonel, he heard him lead that cry, by making uſe of the ſame words himſelf. One Samuel Burden, who had been a ſoldier in the King's army, but at the time of the trial in Colonel Axtel's regiment, ſwore, that himſelf and others were commanded by the Colonel to give evidence againſt the King, and for that purpoſe were ſent to Mr. Cook, who managed the charge againſt the King, to have their exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations taken, which was accordingly done. This man likewiſe ſwore, that the Colonel ſent one Eliſha Axtel with a file of ſoldiers to take boat and go down to the common hangman, who lived beyond the Tower, in order to fetch him to execute the King. Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Nelſon depoſed, That in private converſation at Dublin, Colonel Axtel acknowledged to him, that he was concerned in the ſecret of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0613800301:320"/>
managing the King's execution; and being deſired by the witneſs to tell him who the perſons were that appeared upon the ſcaffold in vizors, he told him they were two ſerjeants, well known both to him and to the witneſs, and that their names were Hewlet and Walker. Such was the evidence given to ſupport the charge in the indictment, for compaſſing and imagining the death of the King. In his defence Colonel Axtel alledged, that he was a commiſſioned officer under the Lord Fairfax, as he had been before under the Earl of Eſſex, and by his commiſſion was to obey his ſuperior officer (who commanded him that day to Weſtminſter-hall), according to the cuſtoms of war; ſo that if he had diſobeyed his ſuperior officer, then he had died, and now muſt die for obeying him. But the Court told him he might have refuſed without any danger as well as Colonel Huncks; and that <hi>paſſive</hi> as well as <hi>active</hi> obedience was required from every man, and that neither his nor his ſuperiors commiſſion bid him kill his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, much leſs the father of his country. As for the muſquets, mounted towards the lady, he ſaid, that if a lady grew uncivil to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the Court, he could do no leſs than check her: That his ſtriking the ſoldiers for not crying <hi>Juſtice!</hi> was a miſtake; for he ſaid he ſtruck them becauſe they did it, ſaying, <hi>I'll give you Juſtice</hi>: That his inciting them at the ſentence to cry <hi>Execution, was the Execution of Juſtice,</hi> and that could do no hurt. The court took a good deal of pains to ſhew him the inſufficiency of theſe pretences, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible they were with the conſtitution of this kingdom, and the laws of the land, upon which ſubject we met with a very curious and inſtructive paſſage, in the Reports of a very learned Judge. The trial laſted, on account of the priſoner's long and large defence, for upwards of three hours; but the Jury, without going from the bar, found him guilty. On the ſixteenth of October, he was brought up again to the Seſſions-houſe, in order to receive ſentence, at which time Mr. Axtel inſiſted, that there was no overt-act proved againſt him ſufficient to ſupport the indictment, and ſuggeſted, that he died only for want of words; upon which the Lord Chief Baron obſerved, that it was otherwiſe, that he was preſent in the Court, beating the ſoldiers, and ſending for an executioner, which were all of them facts, and not words. Upon this Colonel Axtel appealed to God, that he did not find himſelf guilty of conſulting, contriving, or having any hand in the death of the King; and concluded that he was innocent, and prayed God that his blood might not cry againſt them.</p>
            <p>Then ſilence being commanded, the Lord Chief Baron made a long ſpeech, in which he told Colonel Francis Hacker and Mr. Axtel, that they had no cauſe to hope for mercy, nor was there any room for
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0613800301:321"/>
mercy, and then pronounced that ſentence which is uſually given in caſes of high-treaſon. After he was carried back to Newgate, he ſhewed himſelf very full of ſpirit and courage, ſpoke to every body that was about him with great vehemence and zeal for the cauſe in which he died, as appears very fully from the account of his behaviour, printed after his death, by the care of thoſe of his party. In this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he continued, without the leaſt alteration, or ſinking of his ſpirits, which muſt be attributed to his notions of religion, that had made ſuch an impreſſion upon his mind, as entirely prevented his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of that weakneſs and terror which is incident to human nature, at the near approach of death, and of a violent and ſhameful death especially. But the account before-mentioned ſhews us, that he remained firm to the laſt, and ſpoke with the ſame freedom that day he died, as on any other in his whole life. On Friday the nineteenth of October, about nine in the morning, Colonel Francis Hacker, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Daniel Axtel, were drawn on one hurdle, from Newgate to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, where they behaved with great boldneſs and reſolution, more eſpecially the latter, who was the better ſpeaker of the two, and who did not fail to juſtify his conduct to the people, with the ſame ſort of arguments he had uſed before his Judges. After the execution was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the head of Colonel Axtel was ſet up at the further end of Weſtminſter-hall, and his quarters were in like manner diſpoſed of ſo as to become ſpectacles, in other public places. But the body of Mr. Hacker was, by his Majeſty's great favour, given entire to his friends, and by their care was decently interred. At the time of his death, the Colonel left behind him a widow and ſeven children, for whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence he had made a competent proviſion in the time of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.</p>

            <head>AYSCUE, AYSCOUGH, or ASKEW, (Sir GEORGE)</head>
            <p>An eminent Engliſh Admiral in the laſt century. He was deſcended from a very good family in Lincolnſhire, and entered early into the ſea ſervice, where he obtained the character of an able and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced officer, and the honour of knighthood from King Charles I. This, however, did not prevent him from adhering to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when, by a very ſingular intrigue, they got poſſeſſion of the fleet, and ſo zealous he was in the ſervice of his maſters, that when, in 1648, the greateſt part of the navy went over to the Prince of Wales, he, who then commanded the Lion, ſecured that ſhip for the Parliamient, which was by them eſteemed both an acceptable ſervice, and an action of great importance. As this was a ſufficient proof of his fidelity, he had the command given him in a ſquadron, that was
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0613800301:322"/>
employed to watch the motions of the Prince of Wales; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſailed therewith to the coaſt of Ireland, where, by his vigilance, he prevented his Highneſs from doing what he would otherwiſe have done, and by his great intereſt with the ſeamen he drew many of them back to that ſervice from which they had deſerted. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him ſtrongly to the Parliament, who, the next year, ſent him with a conſiderable number of ſhips, and the honourable title of Admiral in thoſe ſeas, to the coaſt of Ireland, which commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he diſcharged with equal vigour and vigilance, ſupplying Dublin with proviſions, attending the army upon all emergencies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing in every reſpect ſo effectually to the reduction of Ireland, that the Parliament not only thought fit to continue him in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for another year, but likewiſe ordered an immediate proviſion to be made for the payment of his arrears, and preſented him with one hundred pounds, as a ſpecial mark of their favour, and the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his ſervices. After the war was finiſhed in Ireland, and the Parliament had thereby time and opportunity, to think of the proper means of ſubduing the reſt of the dominions of the crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to their obedience, Sir George Ayſcue had orders to ſail with a ſmall ſquadron, to reduce the iſland of Barbadoes; but before he was in any readineſs to ſail, his orders were countermanded. The reaſon of this was, that the Parliament had received information, that the Dutch were treating with Sir John Grenville, in order to have the iſles of Scilly put into their hands, and therefore it was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to reduce theſe iſlands firſt.</p>
            <p>Blake and Ayſcue were employed in this expedition, in the ſpring of the year 1651, and performed it with honour and ſucceſs. They had but a ſmall body of troops on board, and Sir John Grenville had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable force in the iſland of St. Mary, commanded by ſome of the beſt officers in the late King's army; ſo that if thoſe diſputes had been decided by the ſword, the engagement muſt have been both bloody and doubtful. Sir John eaſily perceived that this muſt end fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally in reſpect to him, and the King's forces under his command, and, therefore, entered into a treaty with General Blake, and Admiral Ayſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue, who uſed him very honourably, and gave him fair conditions; after which Blake returned to England, and Ayſcue proceeded on his voyage to Barbadoes. The Parliament, when they heard of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Scilly, were extremely well pleaſed, as indeed they had reaſon, ſince privateers from thence did ſo much miſchief, that ſcarcely any trade could be carried on with tolerable ſecurity. But when the conditions were known ſome great men changed their opinions, and gave Blake to underſtand, that he and his colleague had been too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſo that it was doubted whether Parliament would ratify this
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0613800301:323"/>
agreement. Blake ſaid, that if they had given Sir John Grenville good conditions, they had done it with good reaſon; that in the firſt place, it ſaved the effuſion of Engliſh blood; and next, that there was a ſtrong ſquadron of Dutch ſhips at no great diſtance, the commander of which had offered Sir John no leſs than 100,000 pounds, to put theſe iſlands into his hands; that if the Parliament did not approve of his conduct, he ſhould be ſorry for it, and ſhould take care to prevent a miſtake of that ſort in future, by laying down his commiſſion, as he was confident Sir George Ayſcue would likewiſe do. Upon this there was no more ſaid of the articles, which were honourably complied with, and Sir George received orders to ſail immediately to the Weſt-Indies, which he obeyed, never expecting to hear any more of theſe articles, which, as they were made with good reaſon, ſo he thought they would have met with a good reception; but he had afterwards cauſe given him to apprehend, that whatever benefit the Parliament might receive from the ſervice itſelf, they were far enough from being ſatisfied with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which it was done.</p>
            <p>Sir George continued his voyage, without meeting with any croſs accident, till his arrival at Barbadoes; which was on the 26th of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, 1651. He then found his enterprize would be attended with great difficulties, and ſuch as had not been foreſeen at home. The Lord Willoughby, of Parham, commanded there for the King, and had aſſembled a body of five thouſand men for the defence of the iſland. He was a nobleman of great parts and great probity, one who had been extremely reverenced by the parliament before he quitted their party, and whoſe worth had ſo ſtrongly recommended him, both to the eſteem and affection of the inhabitants, that he had as abſolute a diſpoſal of their perſons and properties, as it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a Governor to have, who was in ſuch a ſituation; and the uſe he made of his power and influence, was as perfectly right in itſelf, as the critical circumſtances of thoſe times required. Sir George, though he fully apprehended how many and how great obſtacles lay in his way, yet ſhewed no ſigns of concern, but boldly forced his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the harbour, and made himſelf matter of twelve ſail of Dutch merchantmen that lay there, hoping that this might raiſe an inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the iſland, in which, however, he was miſtaken. The next morning he ſent a ſummons to the Lord Willoughby, requiring him to ſubmit to the authority of the Parliament of England; to which his Lordſhip anſwered, that he knew no ſuch authority, that he had a commiſſion from King Charles II. to be governor of that iſland, and that he would keep it for his Majeſty's ſervice at the hazard of his life. That he might be able to make good his word, he put the iſland and its inhabitants into the beſt poſture of defence poſſible, and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0613800301:324"/>
being much ſuperior in ſtrength, Sir George thought it not prudent to land the few troops he had, and thereby diſcover his weakneſs to ſo cautious an enemy. In the mean time, he received a letter by an advice-boat from England, with the news of the King's being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated at Worceſter, with one intercepted from Lady Willoughby, containing a very particular account of that unhappy affair. Upon this he ſummoned Lord Willoughby a ſecond time, and accompanied his ſummons with Lady Willoughby's letter, which, however, made no impreſſion upon his Lordſhip, who continued firm in his reſolution, of holding out the iſland as long as he could. All this time, Sir George anchored in Speights bay, and ſtayed there till December, when the Virginia Merchant fleet arriving, he reſolved to take that opportunity to land with the greater advantage; for he made as if they were a reinforcement that had been ſent him, and he had only waited for them till then; whereas, the truth was, he had not above two thouſand men, and the ſight of the little army on ſhore, made him cautious of venturing his men, till he thought the inhabitants had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a greater idea of his ſtrength, than they had done before. The Virginia ſhips were welcomed at their coming in, as a ſupply of men of war, and he preſently ordered his men on ſhore: 150 Scotch ſervants aboard that fleet, were added to a regiment of 700 men, and ſome ſeamen, to make their number look more formidable. Sir George had on board his fleet one Colonel Allen, a gentleman of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes, who came from thence into England, to ſolicit from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, a force ſufficient for the reduction of the iſland, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was thought the propereſt man to command the forces on ſhore. He accordingly landed with them on ſeventeenth of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and found Lord Willoughby's torches well entrenched, near a fort which they had on the ſea-coaſt. They attacked him, however, and, in a ſharp diſpute, wherein about ſixty men were killed on both ſides, had ſo much the advantage, that they drove them to the fort, notwithſtanding that Colonel Allen, their commander, was killed by a muket ſhot, as he attempted to land. The ſoldiers and ſeamen, however, puſhed on, and made themſelves maſters of the fort, and four pieces of cannon that were in it. After this, the ſailors returned to their ſhips, which cruized up and down, to prevent any ſuccours coming to the iſlanders, or any merchants trading with them. The ſoldiers poſted themſelves in the fort, and from thence made incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions into the country, upon which the chief of the inhabitants grew weary of the war; which Sir George underſtanding, by the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had in the iſland, he by the ſame means procured Colonel Moddiford, who was one of the moſt leading men in the place, to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0613800301:325"/>
enter into a treaty with him, and this negociation ſucceeded ſo well, that Moddiford, declared publicly for a peace, and joined with Sir George to bring Lord Willoughby, the Governor, to <hi>reaſon,</hi> as they phraſed it.</p>
            <p>Sir George's men were now all on ſhore, and made up a body of two thouſand foot, and an hundred horſe, for many deſerters had come over to him. If Colonel Moddiford had joined him with his party in attacking them, there was no hope of the Governor's eſcaping, who having before deſerted the Parliament, could expect no mercy from them, if he was taken without a treaty. But perhaps all theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations would ſcarcely have prevailed with that generous nobleman to have given up the iſland, if an accident had not happened, which put moſt of the gentlemen about him into ſuch confuſion, that he could no longer depend upon their advice or aſſiſtance. The thing happened thus: his Lordſhip perceiving his ſuperiority lay chiefly in his horſe, reſolved to make a briſk puſh with the body under his immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and having, previous to the execution of his deſign, called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether his officers; while they were ſitting in council, a cannon-ball beat open the door of the room, and took off the head of the centinel poſted before it, which ſo frightened all the gentlemen of the iſland, that they not only compelled the Governor to lay aſide his former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but to retire to a place two miles farther from the harbour. Sir George Ayſcue, taking advantage of this unexpected good fortune, immediately ordered all his forces on ſhore, which conſiſted, as was ſaid, of two thouſand foot, and one hundred horſe, to advance under the command of Captain Morrice, as if he intended to have attacked them in their entrenchments, which ſtruck ſuch a terror into ſome of the principal perſons about the Governor, that after mature deliberation on his own circumſtances, and their diſpoſition, he began to alter his mind; and thereupon, to avoid the effuſion of Chriſtian and Engliſh blood, both parties appointed commiſſaries to treat. Sir George named Captain Peck, Mr. Searl, Colonel Thomas Moddiford, and James Colliton, Eſq. the Lord Willoughby, Sir Richard Peers, Charles Pim, Eſq. Colonel Ellice, and Major Byham, who on the ſeventeenth of January agreed on articles of rendition, which were alike comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and honourable. The Lord Willoughby had what he moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, indemnity and freedom of eſtate and perſon, upon which, ſoon after, he returned to England. The iſlands of N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a, and St. Chriſtopher, were, by the ſame capitulation, ſurrendered to the Parliament, with a proviſo, that Lord Willoughby, Colonel Walrond, and ſome other perſons mentioned in that treaty, were reſtored to their eſtates, and the inhabitants were promiſed, not only indemnity but Protection, in the quiet enjoyment of their plantations, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0613800301:326"/>
that they did nothing to the prejudice of the commonwealth. —This treaty being ſigned, Mr. Searl was appointed Governor of Barbadoes, and Mr. Rynell of Antigua and the Leeward Iſlands, in virtue of a commiſſion, granted to Sir George Ayſcue, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The news of the reduction of theſe iſlands made ſuch a noiſe in that part of the world, that Captain Dennis who was detached with a few ſhips to Virginia, reduced it without much trouble; after which, Sir George conſidering that he had fully executed his commiſſion, and that his preſence was no farther neceſſary in America, reſolved to return with the ſquadron under his command to England, which he accordingly did, and arriving at Plymouth on the twenty-fifth of May, 1652, was received with all imaginable teſtimonies of joy and ſatiſfaction by the people there, to whom he was well known before, as his late ſucceſs alſo ſerved not a little to raiſe and heighten his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. It was not long after his arrival, before he found himſelf again obliged to enter upon action; for the Dutch war which broke out in his abſence, was then become extremely warm, and he was forced to take a ſhare in it, though his ſhips were ſo extremely foul, that they were much fitter to be laid up, than to be employed in any farther ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. On the twenty-firſt of June, 1652, Sir George Ayſcue, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the orders he had received from London, came to Dover, with his eleven ſail, and there joined his old friend, Admiral Blake, on board whoſe ſhip he dined, and was received with all imaginable marks of reſpect and kindneſs, by that famous commander. In the beginning of the next month, Blake having received orders to ſail northward, and deſtroy the Dutch herring fiſhery, Sir George Ayſcue was left to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the fleet in the Downs. Within a few days after Blake's depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he took five ſail of Dutch merchantmen, and had ſcarcely brought them in, before he received advice, that a fleet of forty ſail had been ſeen not far from the coaſt, upon which he gave chace, fell in amongſt them, took ſeven, ſunk four, and ran twenty-four upon the French ſhose, all the reſt being ſeparated from their convoy, which, conſidering that Sir George had with him only the ſquadron he brought from Barbadoes, was very gallantly performed, as Whitelock judiciouſly informs us. In the account that Sir George gave of this action to the Parliament, he obſerved, that running Dutch ſhips upon the French ſhore, was the ſame thing as ſinking or burning them; for though the French defended them vigorouſly from the Engliſh ſhips that purſued them, yet they afterwards went aboard the Dutch, and plundered them without mercy. The Dutch Admiral, Van Tromp, who was at ſea with a great fleet, having information of the ſituation that Sir George Ayſcue was in, reſolved to take advantage of him, and with no leſs than one hundred ſail, clapped in between him and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0613800301:327"/>
the river, and reſolved to ſurpriſe ſuch ſhips as ſhould attempt to go out; or, if that deſign failed, to go in and ſink Sir George and his ſquadron. The Engliſh Admiral ſoon diſcovered their intention, and, cauſing a ſignal to be made from Dover caſtle for all ſhips to keep to ſea, he thereby defeated the firſt part of their project. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Van Tromp attempted the ſecond part of his ſcheme, in hopes of better ſucceſs, and on the eighth of July, when it was ebb, he began to ſail towards the Engliſh Fleet; but the wind dying away, he was obliged to come to an anchor about a league off, in order to expect the next ebb. Sir George, in the mean time, cauſed a ſtrong platform to be raiſed between Deal and Sandown caſtles, well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with artillery, ſo pointed, as to bear directly upon the Dutch as they came in. The militia of the county of Kent were alſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to the ſea-ſhore, to entertain the enemy with their ſmall ſhot; notwithſtanding which preparation, the Dutch Admiral did not recede from his point, but at the next ebb weighed anchor, and would have ſtood into the port; but the wind coming about ſouth-weſt, and blowing directly in his teeth, conſtrained him to keep out, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtreightened for time, he was obliged to ſail away, and leave Sir George ſafe in the harbour, with the ſmall ſquadron he commanded. He was ſoon after ordered to Plymouth, to bring in under his convoy five Eaſt-India ſhips, which he did in the latter end of July; and in the firſt week of Auguſt, brought in four French and Dutch prizes, for which activity and vigilance in his command, he was univerſally commended. In a few days after this, intelligence was received, that Van Tromp's fleet was ſeen off the back of the Iſle of Wight, and it was thereupon reſolved, that Sir George, with his fleet of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men of war, moſt of them hired merchantmen, except flag-ſhips, ſhould ſtretch over to the coaſt of France to meet them. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on the ſixteenth of Auguſt, between one and two of the clock at noon, they got ſight of the enemy, who quitted their merchantmen, being fifty in number. About four the fight began; the Engliſh Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, with nine others, charging through their fleet; his ſhips receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt damage in the ſhrouds, maſts, ſails, and rigging, which was repaid the Dutch in their hulls. Sir George having thus paſſed through them, got the weather-gage, and charged them again; but all his fleet not coming up, and the night already entered, they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a drawn battle. Captain Peck, the Rear-Admiral, loſt his leg, of which, ſoon after, he died. Several captains were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but no ſhip loſt, only ſome ſhattered and torn. Of the Dutch not one was ſaid to be loſt, though many were ſhot through and through, but ſo that they were able to proceed on their voyage,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0613800301:328"/>
and anchored the next day after, being followed by the Engliſh to the iſle of Baſſa; but no farther attempt was made by our fleet, by reaſon, as it was pretended, of the danger of the French coaſts; from whence they returned to Plymouth-Sound, to mend and repair their rigging. The truth of the matter was, ſome of Sir George's Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were a little baſhful in this affair, and the fleet was in ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different a condition, that it was abſolutely neceſſary to refit, before they proceeded again to action. He proceeded next to join Blake in the Northern Seas, where he continued during the beſt part of the month of September, and took ſeveral prizes; and, towards the latter end of that month, Sir George returned with General Blake into the Downs, with one hundred and twenty ſail of men of war. On the twenty-ſeventh of that month a great Dutch fleet appeared, after which Blake with his fleet ſailed, and Sir George Ayſcue, purſuant to the orders he had received, returned to Chatham with his own ſhip, and ſent the reſt of his ſquadron into ſeveral ports to be careened. It does not appear that parliament openly expreſſed any diſlike, or diſtaſte, at Sir George's behaviour upon his coming home, but, on the contrary, ſhewed him all the regard and reſpect imaginable, though he had ſome friends who informed him, that this was in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance only; ſince they could not help expreſſing a diſlike to the terms he had granted to Lord Willoughby at Barbadoes, which they conſidered as the ſecond part of Sir John Grenville's buſneſs, for which they had been ſo angry both with him and Blake. All this, however, Sir George bore without any viſible ſigns of diſcontent, profeſſing that he had done what he took to be his duty, and would continue to do ſo, as long as he commanded in the Engliſh fleet, without troubling himſelf about the humours of particular men, whom, after all his endeavours, he might find it impoſſible to pleaſe. But, while theſe jealouſies and heart-burnings ſubſiſted on both ſides, an occaſion offered which enabled all parties to ſatisfy themſelves. It ſo fell out, that towards the end of November, 1652, the famous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Blake lying at the mouth of our river, began to think that the ſeaſon of the year left no room to expect farther action, for which reaſon he detached twenty of his ſhips to bring up a fleet of colliers from Newcaſtle, twelve more he had ſent to Plymouth, and our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, as is before obſerved, with fifteen ſail, had proceeded up the river in order to their being careened. Such was the ſituation of things, when Van Tromp appeared with a fleet of eighty-five ſail. Upon this Blake ſent for the moſt experienced officers on board his own ſhip, where, after a long conſultation, it was agreed, that he ſhould wait for, and fight the enemy, though he had but thirty-ſeven
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0613800301:329"/>
ſail of men of war, and a few ſmall ſhips. Accordingly, on the twenty-ninth of November a general engagement enſued, which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great fury from one in the afternoon till it was dark. Blake in the Triumph, with his ſeconds, the Victory and the Vanguard, engaged, for a conſiderable time, near twenty ſail of Dutch men of war, and they were in the utmoſt danger of being oppreſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by ſo unequal a force. This, however, did not hinder Blake forcing his way into a throng of enemies, to relieve the Garland and Bonadventure, in doing which he was attacked by many of their ſtouteſt ſhips, which likewiſe boarded him; but after ſeveral times beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them off, he at laſt found an opportunity to rejoin his fleet. The loſs ſuſtained by the Engliſh conſiſted in five ſhips, either taken or ſunk, and ſeveral others diſabled. The Dutch confeſs, that one of their men of war was burnt towards the latter end of the fight, and the Captain and moſt of his men drowned, and alſo that the ſhips of Tromp and Evertſon were much diſabled. At laſt, night having parted the two fleets, Blake ſuppoſing he had ſufficiently ſecured the nation's honour and his own, by waiting the attack of an enemy ſo much ſuperior, and ſeeing no proſpect of advantage by renewing the fight, retired up the river; but Sir George Ayſcue, who inclined to the bolder, but leſs prudent counſel, was ſo diſguſted at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that he laid down his commiſſion. The ſervices this great man had rendered to his country, were none of them more acceptable to the Parliament than this act of laying down his command. They had long wiſhed, and waited, for an opportunity of diſmiſſing him from their ſervice, and were therefore extremely pleaſed that he had ſaved them this trouble: however, to ſhew their gratitude for paſt ſervices, and to prevent his falling into abſolute diſcontent, they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him a preſent of three hundred pounds in money, and likewiſe beſtowed upon him three hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> in Ireland. There is good reaſon to believe, that Cromwell and his faction were a well pleaſed with this gentleman's quitting the ſea-ſervice: for, as they were then meditating, what they ſoon afterwards put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the turning the parliament out of doors, it could not but be agreeable to them, to ſee an officer who had ſo great credit in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and who was ſo generally eſteemed by the nation, laid aſide in ſuch a manner, both as it gave them an opportunity of inſinuating the ingratitude of that aſſembly to ſo worthy a perſon, and as it freed them from the apprehenſion of his diſturbing their meaſures, in caſe he had continued in the fleet; which is highly probable might have come to paſs, considering that Blake was far enough from being of their party, and only ſubmitted to ſerve the Protector, becauſe he
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0613800301:330"/>
ſaw no other way left to ſerve his country, and did not think he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſufficient to preſerve the fleet, after the defection of the army, which perhaps might have been the caſe, if Sir George Ayſcue had continued in his command. This is ſo much the more probable, as it is very certain he never entered into the Protector's ſervice, or ſhewed himſelf at all willing to concur in his meaſures; though there is no doubt that Cromwell would have been extremely glad of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced an officer in his Spaniſh war. He retired after this to his country ſeat in the county of Surrey, and lived there in great honour and ſplendour, viſiting, and being viſited, by perſons of the greateſt diſtinction, both natives and foreigners, and paſſing in the general opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of both, for one of the ableſt ſea-captains of that age. Yet there is ſome reaſon to believe that he had a particular correſpondence with the Protector's ſecond ſon, Henry; ſince there is ſtill a letter in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him to Secretary Thurloe, which ſhews that he had very juſt notions of the worth of this gentleman, and of the expediency of conſulting him in all ſuch matters as had a relation to maritime power. The Protector, towards the latter end of his life, began to grow diſſatisfied with the Dutch, the rather, becauſe of the ſhare they had taken in the affairs of the North, where they had eſpouſed the cauſe of the King of Denmark to a degree of partiality, and were projecting the total ſuppreſſion of the Swediſh power. This did not by any means agree with the Protector's plan in regard to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign affairs, and as it was not in his nature to bear with any diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in his views, ſo he reſolved to deſtroy this ſyſtem of the Dutch, and yet without entering immediately into a war with them. It was with this view, that he encouraged the Swedes to cultivate, with the utmoſt diligence, a maritime force, promiſing in due time to aſſiſt them with a ſufficient number of able and experienced officers, and with an Admiral to command them, who, in point of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was not inferior to any then living. It was upon this occaſion, and for this ſervice, that he caſt his eyes upon Sir George Ayſcue; but not caring to deal directly with a man who had declined acting under his government, and had never frequented his court, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that the propoſition ſhould be made him by the Swediſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and ſent the Lord Keeper, Whitelock, to introduce him to the Admiral, at his country-ſeat. This interview had its effect: Sir George Ayſcue from that time began to entertain favourable thoughts of the deſign, and brought himſelf by degrees to approve of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that was made to him, ſo far as to think, at leaſt, not only of quitting the retreat he had choſen, but even of accepting the offer made him, and of going over for that purpoſe to Sweden. But as
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0613800301:331"/>
great undertakings move ſlowly, and there is much time neceſſary for ripening ſuch vaſt projects into execution; ſo we find that Sir George Ayſcue had not brought himſelf to an abſolute compliance in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this deſign, before the death of the Protector. Yet that did not hinder his cloſing at laſt with the propoſals made him from Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and putting every thing in order for his journey, towards the latter end of the year 1658. But as ſuch a deſign as this was could not be put in execution without making ſome ſtir, and thereby rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing public diſcourſe about it; ſo this had ſuch an effect upon the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh miniſter then reſiding here, that he could not forbear writing to Mr. Secretary Thurloe, in pretty ſtrong terms upon the occaſion, inſinuating, at the ſame time, ſome general reflections on the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Sr George Ayſcue. This, however, had no effect, either in procuring an interpoſition from the State to prevent Sir George from proſecuting his deſign, or in obliging him to alter his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On the contrary, as ſoon as he had ſeen the officers embarked, and had diſpatched ſome private buſineſs of his own, he proſecuted his voyage, though in the very depth of winter. This expoſed him to great hardſhips, which, however, he endured with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; and, on his arrival in Sweden, he was received with all imaginable demonſtrations of civility and reſpect by the King, who was extremely well pleaſed with his coming, and might very probably have made good his promiſe, of promoting him to the rank of High-Admiral of Sweden, if he had not been taken off by an unexpected death. This put an end to his hopes in that country, and diſpoſed Sir George Ayſcue to return home, where a great change had been working in his abſence, which was that of reſtoring King Charles II. It does not at all appear, that Sir George had any concern in this great affair; but the contrary may be rather preſumed, from his former attachment to parliament, and his making it his choice to have remained in Sweden, if the death of the Monarch, who invited him thither, had not prevented him. On his return, however, he not only ſubmitted to the government then eſtabliſhed, but gave the ſtrongeſt aſſurances to the adminiſtration, that he ſhould be at all times ready to ſerve the Public, if ever there ſhould be occaſion; which was very kindly taken, and Sir George Ayſcue had the honour to be introduced to his Majeſty, and to kiſs his hand. It was not long before he was called to the performance of his promiſe; for the Dutch war breaking out in 1664, he was immediately put into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by the direction of the Duke of York, who then commanded the Engliſh fleet. In the ſpring of the year 1665, Sir George Ayſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue hoiſted his flag as Rear-Admiral of the Blue, under the Right
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0613800301:332"/>
Honourable the Earl of Sandwich, and in the great battle that was fought the third of June in the ſame year, that ſquadron had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to break through the Dutch fleet, and thereby made way for one of the moſt glorious victories ever obtained by this nation at ſea: For, in this battle, the Dutch had ten of their largeſt ſhips ſunk or burned, beſides their Admiral Opdam's, which blew up in the midſt of the engagement, by which the Admiral himſelf, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of five hundred men periſhed. Eighteen men of war were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, four fire-ſhips deſtroyed, thirteen Captains, and two thouſand and fifty private men, made priſoners; and this with ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a loſs, as that of one ſhip only, and three hundred private men. As there was ſome time requiſite for refitting and repairing the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh navy, after ſo warm an action, the Duke of York, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the fleet in that engagement, returned to London; but not till the king had viſited the navy, where, going on board the Royal Charles, at the Buoy of the Nore, he knighted ſeveral of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the late battle, and made a grand naval promotion. The fleet being again in a condition to put to ſea, was ordered to rendezvous at Southwold-Bay, from whence, to the number of ſixty ſail, they weighed on the fifth of July, and flood over to the coaſt of Holland. The ſtandard was borne by the gallant Earl of Sandwich, to whom was Vice-Admiral Sir George Ayſcue, and Sir Thomas Tyddiman Rear-Admiral; Sir William Penn was Admiral of the White, Sir William Berkley Vice-Admiral, and Sir Joſeph Jordan Rear-Admiral. The Blue flag was carried by Sir Thomas Allen, whoſe Vice and Rear, were Sir Chriſtopher Mimms, and Sir John Harman. The deſign they went on was, to intercept de Ruyter in his return, or, at leaſt, to take and burn the Turkey and Eaſt-India fleets, of which they had certain intelligence. They ſucceeded in neither of theſe ſchemes; de Ruyter returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly by the north of Scotland, and arrived ſafely in Holland, where he was immediate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y promoted to the chief command of the fleet. The Turkey and India fleets, conſiſting of twenty ſail, under the command of Commodore Bitter, choſe to take the ſame northern route, in hopes of avoiding the Engliſh navy; but having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence at ſea, that this would prove very difficult, if not impoſſible, they took ſhelter in the port of Bergen in Norway. The Earl of Sandwich having detached Sir Thomas Tyddiman to attack them there, returned home, and had the good luck to take eight Dutch men of war, which ſerved as convoys to their Eaſt and Weſt India fleets, and ſeveral merchantmen richly laden, which finiſhed the triumph of that year. The plain ſuperiority of the Engliſh over the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0613800301:333"/>
Dutch at ſea, engaged the French, in order to keep up the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the maritime powers, and make them do their buſineſs by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying each other, to declare on the ſide of the weakeſt, as did the King of Denmark alſo, which, nevertheleſs, had no effect upon the Engliſh, who determined to carry on the war againſt the allies, with the ſame ſpirit they had done againſt the Dutch alone. In the ſpring, therefore, of the year 1666, the fleet was very early at ſea, under the command of the joint Admirals; for a reſolution having been taken at Court, not to expoſe the perſon of the Duke of York any more, and the Earl of Sandwich being then in Spain, in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Ambaſſador-Extraordinary, Prince Rupert, and old Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Monk, now duke of Albermarle, were appointed to command the fleet; having under them as gallant and prudent officers as ever diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the Engliſh navy, and, amongſt theſe, Sir William Berkley commanded the Blue, and Sir George Ayſcue the White ſquadron. Prince Rupert, and the Duke of Albemarle, went on board the fleet the twenty-third of April, 1666, and ſailed in the beginning of May. Towards the latter end of that month, the Court was informed, that the French fleet, under the command of the Duke of Beaufort, were coming out to the aſſiſtance of the Dutch. This rumour of their joining the Dutch was ſpread by France, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to deceive us, and diſtreſs the Dutch; themſelves, in reality, having no ſuch intention. Upon the receiving this news, the Court ſent orders to Prince Rupert to ſail with the White ſquadron, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals excepted, to look out and fight the French; which command that brave prince obeyed; but found it what many wiſe people thought, a mere groundleſs bravado, intended to raiſe the courage of their new allies, and thereby bring them into the greater danger. At the ſame time Prince Rupert ſailed from the Downs, the Dutch put out to ſea, the wind at north-eaſt, and a freſh gale. This brought the Dutch fleet on the coaſt of Dunkirk, and carried his highneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Iſle of Wight; but the wind ſuddenly ſhifting to the ſouth-weſt, and blowing hard, brought the Dutch and the Duke to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor. Captain Bacon, in the Briſtol, firſt diſcovered the enemy, and, by firing his guns, gave notice of it to the Engliſh fleet. Upon this a council of war was called, wherein it was reſolved to fight the enemy, notwithſtanding their great ſuperiority. After the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of prince Rupert, the Duke had with him only the Red and Blue ſquadrons, making about ſixty ſail, whereas the Dutch fleet conſiſted of ninety-one men of war, carrying 4716 guns, and 22,460 men. It was the firſt of June when they were diſcerned, and the Duke was ſo warm for engaging, that he attacked the enemy before
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0613800301:334"/>
they had time to weigh anchor, and, as de Ruyter himſelf ſays in his letter, they were obliged to cut their cables; and in the ſame letter he owns, that to the laſt the Engliſh were the aggreſſors, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their inferiority and other diſadvantages. This day's fight was very fierce and bloody; for the Dutch, confiding in their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, preſſed furiouſly upon the Engliſh fleet, while the Engliſh offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, being men of determined reſolution, fought with ſuch courage and conſtancy, that they not only repulſed the Dutch, but renewed the attack, and forced the enemy to maintain the fight longer than they were inclined to do, ſo that it was ten in the evening before their cannon were ſilent. The following night was ſpent in repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the damages ſuffered on both ſides, and next morning the fight was renewed by the Engliſh with freſh vigour. Admiral Van Tromp, with Vice-Admiral Vander Hulſt, being on board one ſhip, raſhly engaged among the Engliſh, and were in the utmoſt danger, either of being taken or burnt. The Dutch affairs, according to their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, were now in a deſperate condition; but Admiral de Ruyter at laſt diſengaged them, though not till his ſhip was diſabled, and Vice-Admiral Vander Hulſt killed. This only changed the ſcene; for de Ruyter was now as hard puſhed as Van Tromp had been before; however, a reinforcement arriving, preſerved him alſo, and ſo the ſecond day's fight ended earlier than the firſt. The Duke, finding that the Dutch had received a reinforcement, and that his ſmall fleet, on the contrary, was much weakened, through the damages ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome, and the loſs and abſence of others of his ſhips, took, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the evening, the reſolution to retire, and endeavour to join Prince Rupert, who was coming to his aſſiſtance. The retreat was performed in good order, twenty-ſix or twenty-eight men of war who had ſuffered leaſt, brought up the rear, interpoſing between the enemy and the diſabled ſhips, three of which, being ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y much ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, were burnt by the Engliſh themſelves, and the men taken on board the other ſhips. The Dutch fleet followed, but at a diſtance. As they thus ſailed on, it happened on the the third day that Sir George Ayſcue, Admiral of the White, who commanded the Royal Prince (being the largeſt and heavieſt ſhip of the whole fleet) unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately ſtruck upon the ſand called the Galloper, where, being threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the enemy's fire-ſhips, and hopeleſs of aſſiſtance from his friends (whoſe timely return, the near approach of the enemy, and the tide, had abſolutely rendered impoſſible), he was forced to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render. This was that famous engagement, which did equal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to both the maritime powers, and in which both their officers and ſeamen are allowed to have performed as great things as
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0613800301:335"/>
were ever attempted on the watery element. Yet our hiſtorians have given very imperfect accounts of it, even thoſe who ought to have made it their buſineſs to be more particularly acquainted with this tranſaction; ſo that, if we would learn any particulars relating to it, we muſt look for them in the works of ſtrangers, and even of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who, in this reſpect, have been both juſter and kinder than the authors either of our general or naval hiſtories. The Dutch Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, de Ruyter, in his letter to the States-General, ſays, in few words, That Sir George Ayſcue, Admiral of the White, having run upon a ſand bank, fell into their hands, and that after taking out the commanders and men that were left, they ſet the ſhip on fire. But the large relation, collected by order of the States, out of all the letters written to them upon that occaſion, informs us, That Sir George Ayſcue, in the Royal Prince, ran upon the Galloper, an unhappy accident, ſays that relation, for an officer who had behaved very gallantly gallantly during the whole engagement, and who only retired in obedience to the admiral's orders. The unfortunate Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral made ſignals for aſſiſtance; but the Engliſh fleet continued their route; ſo that he was left quite alone, and without hope of ſuccour; in which ſituation he was attacked by two Dutch fire-ſhips, by which, without doubt, he had been burnt, if Lieutenant-Admiral Tromp, who was on board the ſhip of Rear Admiral Sweers, had not made a ſignal to call off the fire-ſhips, perceiving that his flag was already ſtruck, and a ſignal made for quarter; upon which Rear-Admiral Sweers, by order of Tromp, went on board the Engliſh ſhip, and brought off Sir George Ayſcue, his officers, and ſome of his men, on board his own veſſel, and the next morning Sir George was ſent to the Dutch coaſt, in order to go to the Hague in a galliot, by order of General de Ruyter. The Engliſh ſhip was afterwards got off the ſands, notwithſtanding which, General de Ruyter ordered the reſt of the crew to be taken out, and the veſſel ſet on fire, that his fleet might be the leſs embarraſſed; which was accordingly done. But in tie French relation, publiſhed by order of court, we have another circumſtance which the Dutch have thought fit to omit, and it is this, That the crew gave up the ſhip againſt the Admiral's will, who had given orders for ſetting her on fire. There were ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which made the loſs of this ſhip, in this manner, very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Engliſh court, and perhaps this may be the reaſon that ſo little is ſaid of it in our own relations. In all probability, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral de Ruyter took this opportunity of ſending Sir George Ayſcue to the Dutch coaſt the next morning, from an apprehenſion that he might be retaken in the next day's fight. On his arrival at the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0613800301:336"/>
Hague, he was very civilly treated; but to raiſe the ſpirits of their people, and to make the moſt of this dubious kind of victory, the States ordered Sir George to be carried, as it were in triumph, through the ſeveral towns of Holland, and then confined him in the caſtle of Louveſtein, ſo famous in the Dutch hiſtories for having been the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome of their moſt eminent patriots, and from whence the party, that oppoſed the Prince of Orange, were ſtyled the Louveſtein faction. As ſoon as Sir George Ayſcue came to this caſtle, he wrote a letter to king Charles II. to acquaint him with the condition he was in. How long he remained there, or whether he continued a priſoner to the end of the war, is what we cannot determine from any lights that we have been able to procure; but it is ſaid that he afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to England, and ſpent the remainder of his days in peace. It is a thing greatly to be regretted, that ſo little care has been taken, to do juſtice to the memories of ſo many great men as have ſerved this nation, ſome at the expence of their lives, and others of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. Their virtues ſurely deſerve a better reward, and it is to be hoped, that the pains we have taken in this collection, will render the doing juſtice to ſuch great and good men, ſo viſibly neceſſary, that ſucceding generations will have no reaſon to make this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
            <p>It is with a view to this, that even where we cannot render our memoirs of ſuch illuſtrious perſons ſo complete as we could wiſh, we labour with the utmoſt diligence to make them as perfect as we can, which obſervation will be ſufficient to excuſe us to our readers, for concluding this article ſomewhat abruptly, ſince it is done merely through want of materials, and not of inclination.</p>
            <p>AYSSERIUS, or ASSERIUS (MENEVENSIS), by ſome called ASSER, by others ASKER, a learned Monk of St. David's, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom, though much has been ſaid, yet we find very little has been written with certainty, rather, as we apprehend, for want of considering the matter thoroughly, than from any want of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, or from any real obſcurity in which his ſtory is involved. We ſhall, therefore, give as clear and diſtinct an account of him as may be, and remove moſt of the difficulties which have been hitherto thought too obſcure in his hiſtory. He was of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh extraction, probably of that part of South Wales called Pembrokeſhire, and was bred up in the learning of thoſe times, in the Monaſtery of St. David's (in Latin Menevia), whence he derived hit ſurname of Menevenſis. There he is ſaid to have had
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0613800301:337"/>
for his tutor Johannes Patricius, one of the moſt celebrated ſcholars of his age. Here he had alſo the countenance of Nobis, or Novis, Archbiſhop of that ſee, who was alſo his relation; but it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he was either his Secretary or his Chancellor, as ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would have us believe. From St. David's he was invited to the Court of Aelfred the Great, merely from the reputation of his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This ſeems to have been about the year 880, or ſomewhat ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier. Thoſe who had the charge of bringing him to Court, conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from St. David's to the town of Dene (Dean) in Wiltſhire, where the King then was. He received him with great civility, and ſhewed him in a little time the ſtrongeſt marks of favour and affection, inſomuch that he condeſcended to perſuade him not to think any more of returning to St. David's, but rather to continue with him as his Domeſtic Chaplain and aſſiſtant in his ſtudies. Aſſerius, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, modeſtly declined this propoſal, alleging, that it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him to deſert that holy place where he had been educated, and received the order of Prieſthood, for the ſake of any preferment he could meet with elſewhere. King Aelfred then deſired, that he would divide his time between the Court and the Monaſtery, that is to ſay, that he would ſpend ſix months at Court, and ſix at St. David's. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerius would not lightly comply even with this requeſt, but deſired the King's leave to return to St. David's, to aſk the advice of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which he obtained; but in his journey falling ill at Wincheſter of a fever, he lay there ſick twelve months and a week, till the king, wondering at his long ſtay, wrote him letters, requiring his return to Court. But it ſeems he was too weak to ride, of which when King Aelfred was informed by his letter, he deſiſted from his requeſt. As ſoon as he recovered, Aſſerius made a journey to St. David's, where, conſulting with his brethren on the King's propoſal, they unanimouſly agreed that he ſhould accept it, promiſing themſelves great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from his favour with the King, of which, at that time, it ſeems they had great need; one Hemeid, a petty Prince of South Wales, making them exceedingly uneaſy, and ſometimes compelling their Archbiſhop to quit the place of his reſidence. But, at the ſame time, they requeſted of Aſſerius, that he would prevail on the King to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to reſide quarterly at Court and at St. Davids', rather than that he ſhould remain abſent ſix months at a time. When he came back he found the King at Leoneforde, who received him with great marks of diſtinction. He remained with him then eight months at once, reading and explaining to him whatever books were in his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, whereby he grew into ſo great credit with that generous
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0613800301:338"/>
Prince, that on Chriſtmas-eve following, he gave him the monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Amgreſbyri, and Banuwille, that is, Ambroſbury in Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and Banwell in Somerſetſhire, with a ſilk pall of great value, and as much incenſe as a man could carry, ſending together with them this compliment, <hi>That theſe were but ſmall things, and by way of earneſt of better that ſhould follow them.</hi> And, indeed, ſoon after, Aſſerius tells us, he had Exeter beſtowed upon him, and not long after that, the biſhopric of Sherburn, which, however, he ſeems to have quitted in 883, though he always retained the title, as Wilfred Archbiſhop of York was conſtantly ſo ſtyled, though he accepted of another biſhopric. Thenceforward he conſtantly attended the Court, in the manner before ſtipulated, and is named as a perſon, in whom he had a particular confidence, by King Aelfred in his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which muſt have been written ſome time before the year 885; ſince mention is made therein of Eſna, biſhop of Hereford, who died that year. He is alſo mentioned by the King, in his prefatory epiſtle placed before his tranſlation of Gregory's Paſtoral, addreſſed to Wulf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fig, biſhop of London; and therein the King does not call him biſhop of Sherburn, but my biſhop, acknowledging the help received from him and others in that tranſlation. For, as we learn, both from the King and from Aſſerius himſelf, the method uſed by that Prince, in tranſlating, was this: he had the ſenſe of his author given him by one or other of the many learned men he had about him, and then he digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into an eaſy flowing ſtyle (in which he had a peculiar excellency,) that men might thereby be invited to reading; for Aelfred did not tranſlate as an author, to get reputation, but as a Prince, to promote the public good; neither did he deſign that the books which he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſhould paſs for exact tranſlations, but for good and uſeful trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, from which ſuch as underſtood none but their mother tongue, might reap profit and inſtruction. It ſeems to have been the near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, which the genius of Aſſerius bore to that of the King, which gained him ſo great a ſhare in his confidence; and very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it was on this account, that Aſſerius drew up thoſe memoirs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> breaſt; but Aſſerius, finding no room to write any ſuch thing there and yet being deſirous to gratify his maſter, he aſked King Aelfred
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0613800301:339"/>
whether he ſhould not provide a few leaves, in which to ſet down ſuch remarkable things, as occurred either in reading or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: the King was extremely pleaſed with this hint, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Aſſerius to put it immediately into execution, which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did. Purſuing this method conſtantly, their collection began to ſwell, till at length it became of the ſize of an ordinary <hi>Pſalter</hi>; and this was what the King called his <hi>Hand-book</hi> or <hi>Manual.</hi> Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, however, calls it Enchiridion. In all probability Aſſerius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at court during the whole reign of Aelfred, and, for aught we know, ſeveral years after: but where, or when he died, was matter of diſpute, though the Saxon Chronicle poſitively fixes it to the year 910, to which, we think, no juſt objection can be made. The reader will obſerve, that we take Aſſer the Monk, and Aſſer biſhop of Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, for one and the ſame perſon, which ſome, however, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: yet we go farther ſtill, and aſſert him to have been alſo Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of St. David's. We do indeed admit, that if there was ſuch a reader in the public ſchools at Oxford as Aſſer the Monk, he muſt have been ſome other perſon of the ſame name, and not our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: but we do not think this point ſo clearly made out, as to deſerve much diſpute about it, ſince it reſts almoſt wholly on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Harpsfield; for, though he cites the Annals of Wincheſter, yet we find no ſuch thing in the annals that we have, nor is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count conſistent with itſelf in ſeveral other reſpects beſides this of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, as Sir John Spelman has juſtly obſerved. There is no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy about the works of Aſſerius, than about his preferments: for ſome allege that he never wrote any thing but the Annals of King Aelfred; whereas, Pits gives us the idea of no leſs than five other books of his writing, and adds, that he wrote many more. The firſt of theſe is a <hi>Commentary on Boëtius,</hi> which is mentioned by Leland, on the authority of the Chronicle of St. Neot's: the truth is, he explained this author to King Aelfred when he made his Saxon tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, whence the cenſure paſſed upon it, that though it was a work of great uſe in thoſe times, yet it was, in a manner, ridiculous in in ours: the ſame thing may be ſaid of any literal verſion. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing mentioned by Pits, is the annals of Aelfred's life and reign. The third he ſtyles <hi>Annales Britanniae,</hi> or the <hi>Annals of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> in one book, mentioned alſo by Leland and Bale, and which hath been ſince publiſhed by the learned Dr. Gale, who inclined to think it genuine, which is certainly more than it deſerved. The fourth piece, he calls <hi>Aurearum Sententiarum Enchiridion, lib.</hi> 1. id eſt, <hi>An Enchiridion of Golden Sayings, in one Book,</hi> which is without queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0613800301:340"/>
the <hi>Manual</hi> or <hi>Common-Place-Book</hi> made for King Aelfred, and reckoned among his works by this very Pits: It muſt be owned that Leland had alſo ſpoken of this Enchiridion, but more accurately, and in a manner becoming ſo great a writer; for he ſpeaks of it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the learning and diligence of Aſſer, which it certainly was: and though the collections he made concerning this author, are much better and larger than thoſe of Bale and Pits, yet he modeſtly, upon this ſubject, apologizes for ſpeaking ſo little and ſo obſcurely of ſo great a man. The next in Pits' catalogue, is a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Homilies,</hi> and the laſt, a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Epiſtles:</hi> he took it for granted, that Aſſer being a biſhop, preached ſometimes, and that having ſo many friends, he muſt needs write letters, which is all the foundation that can be in nature for theſe two volumes, no ancient author ſaying a word of them. Of the like ſtamp is Biſhop Godwin's account, of his being buried in his cathedral church of Sherburn, which is mere gueſs-work, founded on his being biſhop there; and, with equal probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we might ſay he was buried at St. Davids, though there is not any authority for either. Thus we conclude the article of this moſt excellent perſon, who was, without queſtion, one of the moſt pious, moſt learned, and, withal, one of the moſt modeſt Prelates of the age in which he lived.</p>
            <p>ASSHETON (William) doctor of divinity, was the ſon of Mr. Asſheton, rector of Middleton in Lancaſhire, and deſcended of the ancient family of the baronets of his name in that county. He was born in the year 1641, and being inſtructed in grammar-learning at a private country-ſchool, was removed to Brazen Noſe college at Oxford, July 3, 1658: and elected a fellow of his college in 1663. After taking both his degrees in arts, he went into orders, became chaplain to the duke of Ormond, chancellor of that univerſity; and was admitted doctor in divinity in January, 1673. In the following month he was nominated to the prebend of Knareſburgh, in the church of York; and whilſt he attended his patron in London, obtained the living of St Antholin. In 1676, by the duke's intereſt with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of St. John's, he was preſented to the rectory of Beckenham, in Kent; and was often unanimouſly choſen proctor for Rocheſter in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>
            <p>He was the projector of a ſcheme for providing a maintenance for clergymen's widows and others, by a jointure payable by the Mercers' Company. The bringing this project to perfection, took up his thoughts for many years; for, though encouraged by many judicious perſons to proſecute it, he found much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0613800301:341"/>
in providing ſuch a fund as might be a proper ſecurity to the ſubſcribers. He firſt addreſſed himſelf to the Corporation of the clergy, who declared they were not in a capacity to accept the propoſal. Meettng with no better ſucceſs in his next application to the Royal Bank of England, the doctor applied himſelf to the Mercers Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who agreed with him upon certain rules and orders, of which the following are the chief; That the company will not take in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions beyond the ſum of one hundred thouſand pounds; that all married men of the age of thirty, or under, may ſubſcribe any ſum not exceeding one thouſand pounds; that all married men not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the age of forty, may ſubſcribe any ſum not exceeding five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; and that all married men not exceeding the age of ſixty years, may ſubſcribe any ſum not exceeding three hundred pounds; and that the widows of all perſons ſubſcribing according to theſe limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſhall receive the benefit of thirty pounds per cent. per ann. free of all taxes and charges, at the two uſual feaſts of Lady-day and Michaelmas; and that the firſt of theſe payments ſhall be made at the firſt of the ſaid feaſt-days, which ſhall happen four months or more after the deceaſe of the ſubſcriber; excepting ſuch as voluntarily make away with themſelves, or by any act of their's occaſion their own death, either by duelling or committing any other crime: in any or either of thoſe caſes, the widow receives no annuity; but upon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up the company's bond, to have the ſubſcription-money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to them: That no ſea-faring man may ſubſcribe; nor others, that go farther than Holland, Ireland, or the coaſts of England; and that any perſon may ſubſcribe for others, whom he ſhall nominate in his laſt will, during the natural life of his wife, if ſhe ſurvive, and his intention to be declared in his ſubſcription.</p>
            <p>Dr. Asſheton wrote ſeveral pieces againſt the papiſts and diſſenters, and ſome practical and devotional tracts. A few years before his death, he was offered the headſhip of his college, which he declined. He died at Beckenham, in 1711, in the ſeventieth year of his age. To give his character, as drawn by the writer of his life, "He was very regular and aſſiduous in private devotion, meditation, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing . . . . Hiſtory and philoſophy, he juſtly uſed as the proper hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids to divinity, which was his buſineſs and delight . . . . He rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſubſcribed to all critical, learned and laborious works, by which means he completed one of the beſt libraries any clergyman can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, laying out at leaſt ten pounds per annum to improve and increaſe his firſt ſtock of books. Thoſe of devotion were intermixed, or at hand, to begin and end with . . . . He preached twice every Sunday, to keep the people from ſtraggling, and engage them to frequent the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0613800301:342"/>
church: otherwiſe he knew, and lamented, that we have but too much preaching in the nation. Finding, at length, his labour too great for him, yet, rather than leſſen it, (though in a ſmall pariſh) he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to keep an aſſiſtant; to whom he committed the catechiſing part, in his declining age, allowing him five ſhillings per Sunday over and above thirty pounds per annum, and the benefit of his table all church days, &amp;c. with ſeveral gifts and advantages that made up the whole fifty pounds per annum . . . . He watched diligently over his flock, and would ſuffer none to periſh for want of admonition or reproof, as well in the ſpirit of meekneſs as with all authority. Though he never ſued, cited, or proſecuted the moſt injurious and obſtinate offenders, yet he rebuked and avoided the unruly, and kept the impertinently cenſorious and perverſe at a due diſtance. He ſo much the more deſerved of his pariſh, as he was more generous and charitable among them, than juſt to himſelf, in diſregarding often his ſmall tythes and perquiſites, taking quietly what ſome left him, and helping all; wherein, to make all juſt and eaſy too, he tried all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fair ways, without contention, by letting out the whole, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every man his part; and, at laſt, taking all in kind, when they would not come near the value. He kept up the true moderate Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh hoſpitality, genteelly managed by an excellent virgin-ſiſter, (who lived and died with him while he remained ſingle) and ſome few years after by a truly virtuous wife, though ſickly, for whom he ſet up his coach, being moſt tender of her, and ſorrowful at her death. As he was a moſt affectionate, tender huſband and brother, ſo he was a juſt, indulgent maſter, and had, generally, careful and honeſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom he took pains to make religious, peaceable, and ſober. He daily obſerved the good old religious way of family-devotion. He ſometimes uſed extempore ſermons (having a body of divinity in his head) until he was diſturbed and put into a conſternation with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, by a woman ſwooning away in the church, who was ſoon carried out and the people became ſilent; yet he could not recover his ſubject, or recollect any thing he had ſaid before, which obliged him to make an apology, and come down. Though eaſy of acceſs, and courteous and affable, he diſtinguiſhed perſons, times, and places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His table-talk was both delightful and improving; he diverted ſad ſtories, and decried falſe ones: he would not willingly know a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon, nor ſuffer a liar or tale-bearer in his fight. He never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo frowning, as when a certain gentleman was backbiting another and telling him a ſcandalous ſtory; he ſtarted up, and with emotion aſked him, if he could face the abſent? which ſoon confounded th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
