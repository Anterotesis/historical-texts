            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>A fine girl, maſter Jenkins, a deviliſh fine girl! ſhe has got my eye to a twinkle. There's fire for you —ſpirit!—I deſign to marry her to a Duke: how much money do you think a Duke would expect with ſuch a wench?</p>

                  <p>Why, Colonel, with ſubmiſſion, I think there is no occaſion to go out of our own country here; we have never a Duke in it I believe, but we have many an honeſt gentleman, who, in my opinion, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the young lady.</p>

                  <p>A rake! you damned confounded little baggage; why you wou'd not wiſh to marry a rake, wou'd you? So her huſband is a rake, ſhe does not care what he is! Ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>

                  <p>Well, but liſten to me, papa—When you go out with your gun, do you take any pleaſure in ſhooting the poor tame ducks, and chickens in your yard? No, the partridge, the pheaſant, the woodcock are the game; there is ſome ſport in bringing them down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are wild; and it is juſt the ſame with an huſband or a lover. I would not waſte powder and ſhot, to wound one of your ſober pretty behaved gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but to hit a libertine, extravagant, madcap fellow, to take him upon the wing—</p>

                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, maſter Jenkins, who is this Lionel? They ſay he is a damn'd witty knowing fellow; and egad I think him well enough for one brought up in a college.</p>

                  <p>His father was a general officer, a particular friend of Sir John's, who, like many more brave men, that live and die in defending their country, left little elſe than honour behind him. Sir John ſent this young man, at his own expence, to Oxford; where, while his ſon lived, they were upon the ſame footing: and ſince our young gentleman's death, which you know unfortunately happened about two years ago, he has continued him there. During the vacation he is come to pay us a viſit, and Sir John intends that he ſhall ſhortly take orders, for a very conſiderable benefice in the gift of the family, the preſent incumbent of which is an aged man.</p>

                  <p>Why look you, maſter Jenkins, Sir John Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale is an honeſt gentleman; our families are nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; we have been neighbours time out of mind; and if he and I have an odd diſpute now and then, it is not for want of a cordial eſteem at bottom. He is going to marry his daughter to my ſon; ſhe is a beautiful girl, an elegant girl, a ſenſible girl, a worthy girl, and—a word in your ear—damn me if I aint very ſorry for her.</p>

                  <p>Sorry! Colonel?</p>

                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay—between ourſelves, maſter Jenkins, my ſon won't do.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Jen.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>I tell you, maſter Jenkins, he won't do—he is not the thing, a prig—At ſixteen years old, or thereabouts, he was a bold, ſprightly boy, as you ſhould ſee in a thouſand; could drink his pint of port, or his bottle of claret—now he mixes all his wine with water.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jen.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! if that be his only fault, Colonel, he will ne'er make the worſe huſband, I'll anſwer for it.</p>

                  <p>You know my wife is a woman of quality— I was prevailed upon to ſend him to be brought up by her brother Lord Jeſſamy, who had no children of his own, and promiſed to leave him an eſtate—he has got the eſtate indeed, but, the fellow has taken
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0380901000:8"/>
his Lordſhip's name for it. Now, maſter Jenkins, I would be glad to know, how the name of Jeſſamy is better than that of Oldboy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jen.</speaker>
                  <p>Well! but, Colonel, it is allowed on all hands that his Lordſhip has given your ſon an excellent education.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Pſha! he ſent him to the univerſity, and to travel forſooth; but what of that; I was abroad, and at the univerſity myſelf, and never a ruſh the better for either. I quarelled with his Lordſhip about ſix years before his death, and ſo had not an opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the youth went on; if I had, maſter Jenkins, I would no more have ſuffered him to be made ſuch a monkey of—He has been in my houſe but three days, and it is all turned topſy turvy by him and his raſcally ſervants—then his chamber is like a perfumer's ſhop, with waſh-balls, paſtes, and pomatum—and do you know he had the impudence to tell me yeſterday at my own table, that I did not know how to behave my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>What my wife? In the old way, maſter Jenkins; always complaining; ever ſomething the matter with her head, or her back, or her legs—but we have had the devil to pay lately—ſhe and I did not ſpeak to one another for three weeks.</p>

                  <p>A little affair of jealouſy—you muſt know my game-keeper's daughter has had a child, and the plaguy baggage takes it into her head to lay it to me —Upon my ſoul it is a fine fat chubby infant as ever I ſet my eyes on; I have ſent it to nurſe; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and me, I believe I ſhall leave it a fortune.</p>

                  <p>Ah, Colonel, you will never give over.</p>

                  <p>You know my Lady has a pretty vein of poetry; ſhe writ me an heroic epiſtle upon it, where ſhe calls me her dear falſe Damon; ſo I let her cry a little, promiſed to do ſo no more, and now we are as good friends as ever.</p>

                  <p>What's the matter with the Colonel, Madam; does your ladyſhip know? He ſeems a little diſordered in his ſenſes; I don't think it would be amiſs to take out a commiſſion of lunacy againſt him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
                  <p>Heigho! don't be ſurpriſed, my dear; it was the ſame thing with my late dear brother, Lord Jeſſamy; they never could agree: that good natured, friendly ſoul, knowing the delicacy of my conſtitution, has often ſaid, ſiſter Mary, I pity you. Not but your father has good qualities, and I aſſure you I remember him a very fine gentleman himſelf. In the year of the hard-froſt, one thouſand ſeven hundred and thirty-nine, when he firſt paid his addreſſes to me, he was called agreeable Jack Oldboy, though I married him without the conſent of your noble grandfather.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Jeſſ.</speaker>
                  <p>I think he ought to be proud of me: I believe there's many a Duke, nay Prince, who would eſteem themſelves happy in having ſuch a ſon—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, my dear; but your ſiſter was always your father's favourite: he intends to give her a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious fortune, and ſets his heart upon ſeeing her a woman of quality.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Jeſſ.</speaker>
                  <p>He ſhould wiſh to ſee her look a little like a gentlewoman firſt. When ſhe was in London, laſt winter, I am told ſhe was taken notice of by a few men. But ſhe wants air, manner—</p>

                  <speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
                  <p>And has not a bit of the genius of our family, and I never knew a woman of it but herſelf without. I have tried her: about three years ago I ſet her to tranſlate a little French ſong: I found ſhe had not even an idea of verſification; and ſhe put down love and joy for rhyme—ſo I gave her over.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Jeſſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, indeed, ſhe appears to have more of the Thaleſtris than the Sapho about her.</p>

But, ſuppoſe I ſhould not like her when I ſee her? Why, poſitively, then I will not have her; the treaty's at an end, and, ſans compliment, we break up the congreſs. But, won't that be cruel, after having ſuffered her to flatter herſelf with hopes, and ſhewing myſelf to her. She's a ſtrange dowdy I dare believe: however, ſhe brings proviſion with her for a ſeparate maintenance.</p>
                  <p>Antoine, appretez la toilet. I am going to ſpend a curſed day; that I perceive already; I wiſh it was over, I dread it as much as a general election.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, Lionel, I will not hear of it. What! to run from us all of a ſudden, this way; and at ſuch a time too; the eve of my daughter's wedding, as I may call it; when your company muſt be doubly agreeable, as well as neceſſary to us? I am ſure you have no ſtudies at preſent, that require your attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at Oxford: I muſt, therefore, inſiſt on your putting ſuch thoughts out of your head.</p>

                  <speaker>Lion.</speaker>
                  <p>Upon my word, Sir, I have been ſo long from the univerſity, that it is time for me to think of returning. It is true, I have no abſolute ſtudies; but, really, Sir, I ſhall be obliged to you, if you will give me leave to go.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Come, come, my dear Lionel, I have for ſome time obſerved a more than ordinary gravity growing upon you, and I am not to learn the reaſon of it: I know, to minds ſerious, and well inclined, like yours, the ſacred function you are about to embrace—</p>

                  <p>Why, really, Lionel, from the character of her intended huſband, I have no room to doubt, but this match will make Clariſſa perfectly happy: to be ſure, the alliance is the moſt eligible, for both families.</p>

                  <p>The fondneſs of a father is always ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of partiality; yet, I believe, I may venture to ſay, that few young women will be found more unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable than my daughter: her perſon is agreeable, her temper ſweet, her underſtanding good; and, with the obligations ſhe has to your inſtruction—</p>

                  <speaker>Lion.</speaker>
                  <p>You do my endeavours too much honour, Sir; I have been able to add nothing to Miſs Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale's accompliſhments, but a little knowledge in matters of ſmall importance to a mind already ſo well improved.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't think ſo; a little knowledge, even in thoſe matters, is neceſſary for a woman, in whom, I am far from conſidering ignorance as a deſireable characteriſtic: when intelligence is not attended with impertinent affectation, it teaches them to judge with preciſion, and gives them a degree of ſolidity neceſſary for the companion of a ſenſible man.</p>

                  <p>You may remember I told you, that when I was laſt winter in London, I was followed by an odious fellow, one Harman; I can't ſay but the wretch pleaſed me, though he is but a younger brother, and not worth ſix-pence: And—In ſhort, when I was leaving town, I promiſed to correſpond with him.</p>

                  <p>Madneſs! But this is not the worſt; for what do you think, the creature had the aſſurance to write to me about three weeks ago, deſiring permiſſion to come down and ſpend the ſummer at my father's.</p>

But my father, the kindeſt, beſt of fathers, will he approve the choice I have made? Nay, has he not made another choice for me? And, after all, how can I be ſure that the man I love, loves me again?

                  <p>Well, but Mr. Lionel, conſider, pray conſider now; how can you be ſo prodigious undiſcreet as you are, walking about the hall here, while the gentlefolks are within in the parlour? Don't you think they'll wonder at your getting up ſo ſoon after dinner, and before any of the reſt of the company?</p>

                  <speaker>Lion.</speaker>
                  <p>For Heaven's ſake, Jenny, don't ſpeak to me: I neither know where I am, nor what I am doing; I am the moſt wretched and miſerable of all mankind.</p>

                  <speaker>Jen.</speaker>
                  <p>Poor dear ſoul I pity you. Yes, yes, I believe you are miſerable enough indeed; and I aſſure you I have pitied you a great while, and ſpoke many a word in your favour, when you little thought you had ſuch a friend in a corner.</p>

                  <p>But, good Jenny, ſince, by ſome accident or other, you have been able to diſcover what I would willingly hide from all the world; I conjure you, as you regard my intereſt, as you value your Lady's peace and honour, never let the moſt diſtant hint of it eſcape you; for it is a ſecret of that importance—</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Jen.</speaker>
                  <p>And, perhaps, you think I cant keep a ſecret. Ah! Mr. Lionel, it muſt be hear, ſee, and ſay nothing in this world, or one has no buſineſs to live in it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides who would not be in love with my Lady? There's never a man this day alive but might be proud of it; for ſhe is the handſomeſt, ſweeteſt temperdeſt! And I am ſure one of the beſt miſtreſſes, ever poor girl had.</p>

                  <speaker>Jen.</speaker>
                  <p>And ſo ſhe is indeed—Do you know that ſhe gave me her blue and ſilver ſack to day, and it is every crum as good as new; and, go things as they will, don't you be fretting and vexing yourſelf, for I am mortally ſartain ſhe would liverer ſee a toad than this Jeſſamy. Though I muſt ſay, to my thinking, he's a very likely man; and a finer pair of eye-brows, and a more delicater noſe I never ſaw on a face.</p>

                  <speaker>Lion.</speaker>
                  <p>What you tell me, Jenny, is a thing I neither merit nor expect: No, I am unhappy, and let me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo; my moſt preſumptuous thoughts ſhall never carry me to a wiſh that may affect her quiet, or give her cauſe to repent.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Jen.</speaker>
                  <p>That's very honourable of you I muſt needs ſay; but for all that, liking's liking, and one can't help it; and if it ſhould be my Lady's caſe it is no fault of yours. I am ſure, when ſhe called me into her dreſſing-room, before ſhe went down to dinner, there ſhe ſtood with her eyes brim full of tears; and ſo I fell a crying for company—and then ſhe ſaid ſhe could not abice the chap in the parlour; and at the ſame time, ſhe bid me take an opportunity to ſpeak to you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to meet her in the garden this evening after tea; for ſhe has ſomething to ſay to you.</p>

                  <p>Jenny, I ſee you are my friend; for which I thank you, though I know it is impoſſible to do me any ſervice; take this ring and wear it for my ſake.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jen.</speaker>
                  <p>I am very much obliged to your honour; I am your friend indeed—but, I ſay, you won't forget to be in the garden now; and in the mean time keep as little in the houſe as you can, for walls have eyes and ears; and I can tell you the ſervants take notice of your uneaſineſs, tho' I am always deſiring them to mind their own buſineſs.</p>

                  <p>Pſha! have a care yourſelf; it is you that breeds ſuſpicion, ſighing and pining about; you look for all the world like a ghoſt; and if you don't pluck up your ſpirits you will be a ghoſt ſoon; letting things get the better of you. Though to be ſure when I thinks with myſelf, being croſs'd in love is a terrible thing— There was a young man in the town where I was born made away with himſelf upon the account of it.</p>

                  <p>Hold; zounds let her go; I knew the ſpider would ſet her a galloping, with her damned fuſs about her brother my Lord Jeſſamy.— Harman come here.—How do you like my daughter? Is the girl you are in love with as handſome as this?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>In my opinion, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>What, as handſome as Dy—! I'll lay you twenty pounds ſhe has not ſuch a pair of eyes. — He tells me he's in love, Dy; raging mad for love, and, by his talk, I begin to believe him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dia.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, for my part, papa, I doubt it very much; though, by what I heard the gentleman ſay juſt now wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hin, I find he imagines the lady has a violent partiality for him; and yet he may be miſtaken there too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>For ſhame, Dy, what the miſchief do you mean? How can you talk ſo tartly to a poor young fellow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der misfortunes? Give him your hand, and aſk his pardon.— Don't mind her, Harman.—For all this, ſhe is as good-natur'd a little devil, as ever was born.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>You may remember, Sir, I told you before dinner, that I had for ſome time carried on a private correſpondence with my lovely girl; and that her father, whoſe conſent we deſpair of obtaining, is the great obſtacle to our happineſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Why don't you carry her off in ſpight of him, then?—I ran away with my wife—aſk my Lady Mary, ſhe'll tell you the thing herſelf.—Her old conceited Lord of a father thought I was not good enough; but I mounted a garden-wall, notwithſtanding their cheveux-de-frize of broken glaſs bottles, took her out of a three pair of ſtairs window, and brought her down a ladder in my arms.—By the way, ſhe would have ſqueezed through a cat-hole to get at me.—And I would have taken her out of the Tower of London, damme, if it had been ſurrounded with the three regiments of guards.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Dia.</speaker>
                  <p>But ſurely, papa, you would not perſuade the gentleman to ſuch a proceeding as this is; conſider the noiſe it will make in the country; and if you are known to be the adviſer and abettor—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, what do I care? I ſay, if he takes my advice he'll run away with her, and I'll give him all the aſſiſtance I can.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>I am ſure, Sir, you are very kind; and, to tell you the truth, I have more than once had the very ſcheme in my head, if I thought it was feaſible, and knew how to go about it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Feaſible, and knew how to go about it! The thing's feaſible enough, if the girl's willing to go off with you, and you have ſpirit ſufficient to undertake it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>O, as for that Sir, I can anſwer.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dia.</speaker>
                  <p>What, Sir, that the lady will be willing to go off with you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>No, Ma'am, that I have ſpirit enough to take her, if ſhe is willing to go; and thus far I dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to promiſe, that between this and to-morrow morning I will find out whether ſhe is or not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>So he may; ſhe lives but in this county; and tell her, Harman, you have met with a friend, who is inclined to ſerve you. You ſhall have my poſt-chaiſe at a minute's warning; and if a hundred pieces will be of any uſe to you, you may command 'em.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>And you are really ſerious, Sir?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Serious; damme if I an't. I have put twenty young fellows in a way of getting girls that they never would have thought of: and bring her to my houſe; whenever you come you ſhall have a ſupper and a bed; but you muſt marry her firſt, becauſe my Lady will be ſqueamiſh.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dia.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, but, my dear papa, upon my word you have a great deal to anſwer for: ſuppoſe it was your own caſe to have a daughter in ſuch circumſtances, would you be obliged to any one—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Hold your tongue, huſſy, who bid you put in your oar? However, Harman, I don't want to ſet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0380901000:37"/>
you upon any thing; 'tis no affair of mine to be ſure, I only give you advice, and tell you how I would act if I was in your place.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>I aſſure you, Sir, I am quite charm'd with the advice; and, ſince you are ready to ſtand my friend, I am determined to follow it.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I deſire to know what groſs acts of imprudence you have ever diſcovered in me, to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize you in this licence, or make you imagine I ſhould not ſhew ſuch marks of my reſentment as your mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous treatment of me deſerves.</p>

                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, my dear Diana, I confeſs I have been rather too bold;—but conſider, I languiſh'd to ſee you; and when an opportunity offer'd to give me that pleaſure without running any riſque, either of your quiet or reputation, how hard was it to be reſiſted? 'Tis true, I little thought my viſit would be attended with ſuch happy conſequences as it now ſeems to promiſe.</p>

                  <p>Upon my word, a pretty elegant dreſſing-room this; but confound our builders, or architects, as they call themſelves, they are all errant ſtone-maſons; not one of them know the ſituation of doors, windows, or chimnies; which are as eſſential to a room as eyes, noſe and mouth to a countenance.

                  <p>My dear brother, you are not come here as a virtuoſo to admire the temple; but as a votary to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the deity to whom it belongs. Shew, I beſeech you, a little more devotion, and tell me, how do you like Miſs Flowerdale? don't you think her very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome?</p>

                  <p>Why, Sir, this is the matter, Sir—Your maſter's daughter, Sir, has behaved to me with damn'd inſolence, and impertinence; and, you may tell Sir John Flowerdale, firſt, with regard to her,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0380901000:46"/>
that, I think ſhe is a ſilly, ignorant, aukward, ill bred country puſs.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Jeſſ.</speaker>
                  <p>And, that, with regard to himſelf; he is, in my opinion, an old, doating, ridiculous, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try 'ſquire; without the knowledge of either men or things; and, that he is below my notice, if it were not to deſpiſe him.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Jeſſ.</speaker>
                  <p>And, adviſe him and his daughter to keep out of my way; for, by gad, I will affront them, in the firſt place I meet them—And, if your maſter is for carrying things further; tell him, I fence better than any man in Europe.</p>

Egad, my own fingers itched to be at him, once or twice; and as ſtout as he is, I fancy theſe old fiſts would give him a bellyful. He complains of Miſs Clariſſa; but, ſhe is incapable of treating him in the manner he ſays. Perhaps, ſhe may have behaved with ſome coldneſs towards him; and, yet, that is a myſtery to me too; for, ſhe has ſeen him before; and, I have heard Sir John ſay a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, that ſhe expreſſed no repugnance to the match.</p>

Oh Lionel! Clariſſa has deceived me: in this affair ſhe has ſuffered me to deceive myſelf. The meaſures which I have been ſo long preparing are broken in a moment—my hopes fruſtrated; and both parties, in the eye of the world, rendered light and ridiculous.</p>

                  <p>No, Lionel, no; the matter is paſt, and there's an end of it; yet I would conjecture to what ſuch an unexpected turn in her conduct can be owing; I would fain be ſatisfied of the motive that could urge her to ſo extraordinary a proceeding, without the leaſt intimation, the leaſt warning to me, or any of her friends.</p>

                  <p>However, my particular diſappointment ought not to be detrimental to you, nor ſhall it: I well know how irkſome it is to a generous mind to live in a ſtate of dependence, and have long had it in my thoughts to make you eaſy for life.</p>

                  <p>There is an eſtate in this county which I purchaſed ſome years ago, by me it will never be miſſed, and whoever marries my daughter will have little reaſon to complain of my diſpoſing of ſuch a trifle for my own gratification.

                  <p>Suppoſe I do, you give me a very ill proof of your love for me, when you would take advantage of my tenderneſs, to blind my reaſon: how can you have ſo little regard for my honour as to ſacrifice it to a vain triumph? For, it is in that light I ſee the raſh action you are forcing me to commit; nay, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks my conſenting to it ſhould injure me in your own eſteem.

                  <p>Hang fortune! It is the bane of love; and, therefore, they are both pictur'd blind, to ſhew, that their coming together can never be premeditated; but, if they do meet, it is by chance, when they joſtle, and one generally overturns t'other.</p>

                  <p>Hey dey! what's the meaning of this? Who is it went out of the room there? Have you and my daughter been in conference, Mr. Harman? Dy and you in private, eh?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, faith, Sir, ſhe has been taking me to taſk here, very ſeverely, with regard to this affair; and ſhe has ſaid ſo much againſt it, and put it into ſuch a ſtrange light, that, ſhe has almoſt ſtagger'd my reſolution.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>A buſy impertinent baggage; egad, I wiſh I had catched her meddling, and after I had ordered her not: but, the thing's gone too far now to retract: you ſay, you have ſent to the girl, and ſhe has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd for anſwer, that ſhe is ready to go with you; you muſt not diſappoint the poor thing, nor you ſhan't.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no, Colonel, I am determined; I always have politeneſs enough to hear a lady's reaſons; but, conſtancy enough to keep a will of my own.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Very well—now, let me aſk you; don't you think it would be proper upon this occaſion to have a letter ready writ for the father, to let him know who has got his daughter, where you have taken her, and how you deſign to diſpoſe of her?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly, Sir, and I'll write it directly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>You write it! you be damn'd! I wo'nt truſt you with it; I tell you, Harman, you'll commit ſome curſed blunder, if you don't leave the management of this whole affair to me: I have writ the letter for you myſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay—here, read it; I think its the thing: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, you are welcome to make any alteration you like.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>"Sir, I have loved your daughter a great while, ſecretly; ſhe aſſures me there is no hopes of your conſenting to our marriage; I therefore, take her without it. I am a gentleman who will uſe her well;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0380901000:58"/>
and, when you conſider the matter, I dare ſwear you will be willing to give her a fortune. If not, you ſhall find I dare behave myſelf like a man—A word to the wiſe—You muſt expect to hear from me in another ſtile."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, Sir, I will tell you what you muſt do with this letter: as ſoon as you have got off with the girl, Sir, ſend your ſervant back to leave it at the houſe, with orders to have it deliver'd to the old gentleman.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Upon my honour, I will, Colonel.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>But, upon my honour, I don't believe you'll get the girl: come, Harman, I'll bet you a buck, and ſix dozen of burgundy, that you won't have ſpirit enough to bring this affair to a criſis.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Then look into the court there, Sir; a chaiſe with four of the prettieſt bay geldings in England, with two boys in ſcarlet and ſilver jackets, that will whiſk you along.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Boys! Colonel? Little cupids, to tranſport me to the ſummit of my deſires.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, but for all that, it mayn't be amiſs for me to talk to them a little out of the window for you. Dick, come hither; you are to go with this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and do whatever he bids you; and, take into the chaiſe whoever he pleaſes; and, drive like devils, do you hear; but, be kind to the dumb beaſts.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Oldboy, here is a note from Sir John Flowerdale: it is addreſs'd to me, intreating my ſon to come over there again this morning. He apprehends the accident yeſterday aroſe from ſome miſtake, and I really believe it did; for certainly the young Lady could not be ſo wanting to her own intereſt, as premeditatedly to refuſe my ſon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
                  <p>The note is brought by a maid: ſhe is in the anti-chamber—We had better ſpeak to her—Child, child, why don't you come in?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Why Sir John gave it to me, to deliver to my uncle Jenkins, and I took it down to his houſe; but while we were talking together, he remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had ſome buſineſs with Sir John, ſo he deſired me to bring it, becauſe he ſaid it was not proper to be ſent by any of the common ſervants.</p>

                  <p>No, Sir, it was no joke, you made me a proffer of money, ſo you did, whereby I told you, you had a lady of your own, and that though ſhe was old you had no right to deſpiſe her.</p>

                  <p>My chief trade, Sir, is plain dealing; and, as that is a commodity you have no reaſon to be very fond of, I would not adviſe you to purchaſe any of it by impertinence;</p>
