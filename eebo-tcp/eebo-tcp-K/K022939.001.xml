            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In diſcharge of this truſt, the Public has here a complete Edition of his Works; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in ſuch a manner, as, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would have been to his ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Editor hath not, for the ſake of profit, ſuffered the Author's Name to be made cheap by a <hi>Subſcription;</hi> nor his Works to be defrauded of their due Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours by a vulgar or inelegant Impreſſion; nor his memory to be diſgraced by any pieces unworthy of his talents or virtue. On the contrary, he hath, at a very great expenſe, ornamented this Edition with all the advantages which the beſt Artiſts in Paper, Printing, and Sculpture could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon it.</p>
            <p>If the Public hath waited longer than the deference due to it ſhould have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, it was owing to a reaſon which the Editor need not make a ſecret. It was his regard to the family-intereſts of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friend. Mr. Pope, at his death, left large impreſſions of ſeveral parts of his Works, unſold; the property of which was adjudged to belong to his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and the Editor was willing they ſhould have time to diſpoſe of them to the
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0902000401:12"/>
beſt advantage, before the publication of this Edition (which hath been long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared) ſhould put a ſtop to the ſale.</p>
            <p>But it may be proper to be a little more particular concerning the ſuperiority of this Edition above all the preceding; ſo far as Mr. Pope himſelf was concerned. What the Editor hath done, the Reader muſt collect for himſelf.</p>
            <p>The FIRST Volume, and the original poems in the SECOND, are here printed from a copy corrected throughout by the Author himſelf, even to the very preface: Which, with ſeveral additional notes in his own hand, he delivered to the Editor a little before his death. The Juvenile tranſlations, in the other part of the SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COND Volume, it was never his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bring into this Edition of his Works, on account of the levity of ſome, the freedom of others, and the little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of any. But theſe being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of other men, the Editor had it not in his power to follow the Author's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>The THIRD Volume, all but the <hi>Eſſay on Man</hi> (which, together with the <hi>Eſſay</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0902000401:13"/>
               <hi>on Criticiſm,</hi> The Author, a little before his death, had corrected and publiſhed in Quarto, as a ſpecimen of his projected Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) was printed by him in his laſt ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (but never publiſhed) in the manner it is now given. The diſpoſition of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle on the Characters of Men</hi> is quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; <hi>that</hi> on the <hi>Characters of Women,</hi> much enlarged; and the <hi>Epiſtles on Riches and Taſte</hi> corrected and improved. To theſe advantages of the THIRD Volume, muſt be added a great number of fine verſes taken from the Author's Manuſcript-copies of theſe poems, communicated by him for this purpoſe to the Editor. Theſe, when he firſt publiſhed the poems to which they belong, he thought proper, for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reaſons, to omit. Some from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript-copy of the <hi>Eſſay on Man,</hi> which tended to diſcredit <hi>fate,</hi> and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the <hi>moral government</hi> of God, had, by the Editor's advice, been reſtored to their places in the laſt Edition of that Poem. The reſt, together with others of the like ſort from his Manuſcript-copy of the other <hi>Ethic Epiſtles,</hi> are here inſerted
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0902000401:14"/>
at the bottom of the page, under the title of <hi>Variations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The FOURTH Volume contains the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires;</hi> with their <hi>Prologue,</hi> the <hi>Epiſtle to Dr. Arbuthnot;</hi> and <hi>Epilogue,</hi> the two poems intitled MDCCXXXVIII. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> and <hi>Epilogue</hi> are here given with the like advantages as the <hi>Ethic Epiſtles</hi> in the foregoing Volume, that is to ſay, with the <hi>Variations,</hi> or additional verſes from the Author's Manuſcripts. The <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> to the <hi>Satires</hi> is likewiſe inriched with many and large notes now firſt printed from the Author's own Manuſcript.</p>
            <p>The FIFTH Volume contains a correcter and completer Edition of the <hi>Dunciad</hi> than hath been hitherto publiſhed; of which, at preſent I have only this further to add, That it was at my requeſt he laid the plan of a fourth Book. I often told him, It was pity ſo fine a poem ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main diſgraced by the meanneſs of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the moſt <hi>inſignificant</hi> of all Dunces, bad Rymers and malevolent Cavillers: That he ought to raiſe and enoble it by pointing his Satire againſt the moſt <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious</hi> of all, Minute-philoſophers and
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0902000401:15"/>
Free-thinkers. I imagined, too, it was for the intereſts of Religion to have it known, that ſo great a Genius had a due abhorrence of theſe peſts of Virtue and Society. He came readily into my opinion; but, at the ſame time, told me it would create him many Enemies. He was not miſtaken. For tho' the terror of his pen kept them for ſome time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, yet on his death they roſe with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained fury in numerous Coffee-houſe tales, and Grub-ſtreet libels. The plan of this admirable Satire was artfully contrived to ſhew, that the follies and defects of a faſhionable EDUCATION naturally led to, and neceſſarily ended in, FREE-THINK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING; with deſign to point out the only remedy adequate to ſo fatal an evil. It was to advance the ſame ends of virtue and religion, that the Editor prevailed on him to alter every thing in his <hi>moral writings</hi> that might be ſuſpected of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt glance towards <hi>Fate</hi> or NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURALISM; and to add what was proper to convince the world, that he was warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſide of <hi>moral Government</hi> and a <hi>revealed Will.</hi> And it would be injuſtice
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0902000401:16"/>
to his memory not to declare that he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced theſe occaſions with the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The SIXTH Volume conſiſts of Mr. Pope's miſcellaneous pieces in verſe and proſe. Amongſt the <hi>Verſe</hi> ſeveral fine poems make now their firſt appearance in his Works. And of the <hi>Proſe,</hi> all that is good, and nothing but what is exquiſitely ſo, will be found in this Edition.</p>
            <p>The SEVENTH, EIGHTH, and NINTH Volumes conſiſt entirely of his <hi>Letters.</hi> The more valuable, as they are the only true models which we, or perhaps any of our neighbours have, of <hi>familiar Epiſtles.</hi> This collection is now made more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete by the addition of ſeveral new pieces. Yet, excepting a ſhort explanatory letter to Col. M. and the <hi>Letters</hi> to Mr. A. and Mr. W. (the latter of which are given to ſhew the Editor's inducements, and the engagements he was under, to intend the care of this Edition) excepting theſe, I ſay, the reſt are all here publiſhed from the Author's own printed tho' not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, copies delivered to the Editor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0902000401:17"/>
On the whole, the Advantages of this Edition, above the preceding, are theſe, That it is the firſt complete collection which has ever been made of his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Writings; That all his principal poems, of early or later date, are here given to the public with his laſt corrections and improvements; That a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his verſes are here firſt printed from the Manuſcript-copies of his principal poems of later date; That many new notes of the Author's are here added to his Poems; and laſtly, that ſeveral pieces, both in proſe and verſe, make now their firſt appearance before the Public.</p>
            <p>The Author's life deſerves a juſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume; and the Editor intends to give it. For to have been one of the firſt Poets in the world is but his ſecond praiſe. He was in a higher Claſs. He was one of the <hi>nobleſt works of God.</hi> He was an <hi>honeſt Man</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <q>
                     <l>" A wit's a feather, and a chief's a rod,</l>
                     <l>" An honeſt Man's the nobleſt work of God.</l>
                  </q>

               <head>PREFACE.</head>
               <p>I Am inclined to think that both the writers of books, and the readers of them, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally not a little unreaſonable in their expectations. The firſt ſeem to fancy that the world muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove whatever they produce, and the latter to imagine that authors are obliged to pleaſe them at any rate. Methinks, as on the one hand, no ſingle man is born with a right of controuling the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of all the reſt; ſo on the other, the world has no title to demand, that the whole care and time of any particular perſon ſhould be ſacrificed to its entertainment. Therefore I cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that writers and readers are under equal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, for as much fame, or pleaſure, as each affords the other.</p>
               <p>Every one acknowledges, it would be a wild notion to expect perfection in any work of man: and yet one would think the contrary was taken for granted, by the judgment commonly paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Poems. A Critic ſuppoſes he has done his part, if he proves a writer to have failed in an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or erred in any particular point: and can it then be wondered at, if the Poets in general ſeem reſolved not to own themſelves in any error? For
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0902000401:23"/>
as long as one ſide will make no allowances, the other will be brought to no acknowledgements<note n="a" place="bottom">In the former editions it was thus—<hi>For as long as one ſide deſpiſes a well meant endeavour, the other will not be ſatisfied with a moderate approbation.</hi>—But the Author altered it, as theſe words were rather a conſequence from the concluſion he would draw, than the concluſion itſelf, which he has now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</note>.</p>
               <p>I am afraid this extreme zeal on both ſides is ill-placed; Poetry and Criticiſm being by no means the univerſal concern of the world, but only the affair of idle men who write in their clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, and of idle men who read there.</p>
               <p>Yet ſure upon the whole, a bad Author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves better uſage than a bad Critic: for a Writer's endeavour, for the moſt part, is to pleaſe his Readers, and he fails merely through the miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of an ill judgment; but ſuch a Critic's is to put them out of humor; a deſign he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go upon without both that and an ill temper.</p>
               <p>I think a good deal may be ſaid to extenuate the fault of bad Poets. What we call a Genius, is hard to be diſtinguiſhed by a man himſelf, from a ſtrong inclination: and if his genius be ever ſo great, he cannot at firſt diſcover it any other way, than by giving way to that prevalent propenſity which renders him the more liable to be miſtaken. The only method he has, is to make the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by writing, and appealing to the judgment of others: now if he happens to write ill (which is certainly no ſin in itſelf) he is immediately made
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0902000401:24"/>
an object of ridicule. I wiſh we had the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to reflect that even the worſt authors might, in their endeavour to pleaſe us, deſerve ſomething at our hands. We have no cauſe to quarrel with them but for their obſtinacy in perſiſting to write; and this too may admit of alleviating circumſtances. Their particular friends may be either ignorant, or inſincere; and the reſt of the world in general is too well bred to ſhock them with a truth, which generally their Bookſellers are the firſt that inform them of. This happens not till they have ſpent too much of their time, to apply to any profeſſion which might better fit their talents; and till ſuch talents as they have are ſo far diſcredited as to be but of ſmall ſervice to them. For (what is the hardeſt caſe imaginable) the reputation of a man generally depends upon the firſt ſteps he makes in the world, and people will eſtabliſh their opinion of us, from what we do at that ſeaſon when we have leaſt judgment to direct us.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, a good Poet no ſooner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his works with the ſame deſire of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but it is imagined he is a vain young creature given up to the ambition of fame; when perhaps the poor man is all the while trembling with the fear of being ridiculous. If he is made to hope he may pleaſe the world, he falls under very unlucky circumſtances: for, from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he prints, he muſt expect to hear no more truth, than if he were a Prince, or a Beauty. If

he has not very good ſenſe (and indeed there are twenty men of wit, for one man of ſenſe) his living thus in a courſe of flattery may put him in no ſmall danger of becoming a Coxcomb: if he has, he will conſequently have ſo much diffidence as not to reap any great ſatisfaction from his praiſe; ſince, if it be given to his face, it can ſcarce be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from flattery, and if in his abſence, it is hard to be certain of it. Were he ſure to be commended by the beſt and moſt knowing, he is as ſure of being envied by the worſt and moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, which are the majority; for it is with a fine Genius as with a fine faſhion, all thoſe are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at it who are not able to follow it: and it is to be feared that eſteem will ſeldom do any man ſo much good, as ill-will does him harm. Then there is a third claſs of people who make the largeſt part of mankind, thoſe of ordinary or indifferent capacities; and theſe (to a man) will hate, or ſuſpect him: a hundred honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will dread him as a Wit, and a hundred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Women as a Satiriſt. In a word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be his fate in Poetry, it is ten to one but he muſt give up all the reaſonable aims of life for it. There are indeed ſome advantages accruing from a Genius to Poetry, and they are all I can think of: the agreeable power of ſelf-amuſement when a man is idle or alone; the privilege of being admitted into the beſt company; and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſaying as many careleſs things as other
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0902000401:28"/>
people, without being ſo ſeverely remarked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>I believe, if any one, early in his life, ſhould contemplate the dangerous fate of authors, he would ſcarce be of their number on any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The life of a Wit is a warfare upon earth; and the preſent ſpirit of the learned world is ſuch, that to attempt to ſerve it (any way) one muſt have the conſtancy of a martyr, and a reſolution to ſuffer for its ſake. I could wiſh people would believe what I am pretty certain they will not, that I have been much leſs concerned about Fame than I durſt declare till this occaſion, when me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I ſhould find more credit than I could here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: ſince my writings have had their fate already, and it is too late to think of prepoſſeſſing the reader in their favour. I would plead it as ſome merit in me, that the world has never been prepared for theſe Trifles by Prefaces, byaſſed by recommendations, dazled with the names of great Patrons, wheedled with fine reaſons and pretences, or troubled with excuſes. I confeſs it was want of conſideration that made me an author; I writ becauſe it amuſed me; I corrected becauſe it was as pleaſant to me to correct as to write; and I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed becauſe I was told I might pleaſe ſuch as it was a credit to pleaſe. To what degree I have done this, I am really ignorant; I had too much fondneſs for my productions to judge of them at firſt, and too much judgment to be pleaſed with
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0902000401:29"/>
them at laſt. But I have reaſon to think they can have no reputation which will continue long, or which deſerves to do ſo: for they have always fallen ſhort not only of what I read of others, but even of my own Ideas of Poetry.</p>
               <p>If any one ſhould imagine I am not in earneſt, I deſire him to reflect, that the Ancients (to ſay the leaſt of them) had as much Genius as we: and that to take more pains, and employ more time, cannot fail to produce more complete pieces. They conſtantly apply'd themſelves not only to that art, but to that ſingle branch of an art, to which their talent was moſt powerfully bent; and it was the buſineſs of their lives to correct and finiſh their works for poſterity. If we can pretend to have uſed the ſame induſtry, let us expect the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: Tho' if we took the ſame care, we ſhould ſtill lie under a farther misfortune: they writ in languages that became univerſal and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, while ours are extremely limited both in extent and in duration. A mighty foundation for our pride! when the utmoſt we can hope, is but to be read in one Iſland, and to be thrown aſide at the end of one Age.</p>
               <p>All that is left us is to recommend our produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the imitation of the Ancients: and it will be found true, that, in every age, the higheſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for ſenſe and learning has been obtain'd by thoſe who have been moſt indebted to them. For, to ſay truth, whatever is very good ſenſe, muſt
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0902000401:30"/>
have been common ſenſe in all times; and what we call Learning, is but the knowledge of the ſenſe of our predeceſſors. Therefore they who ſay our thoughts are not our own, becauſe they reſemble the Ancients, may as well ſay our faces are not our own, becauſe they are like our Fathers: And indeed it is very unreaſonable, that people ſhould expect us to be Scholars, and yet be angry to find us ſo.</p>
               <p>I fairly confeſs that I have ſerv'd myſelf all I could by reading; that I made uſe of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of authors dead and living; that I omitted no means in my power to be inform'd of my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, both by my friends and enemies: But the true reaſon theſe pieces are not more correct, is owing to the conſideration how ſhort a time they, and I, have to live: One may be aſhamed to conſume half one's days in bringing ſenſe and rhyme together; and what Critic can be ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, as not to leave a man time enough for any more ſerious employment, or more agreeable amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>The only plea I ſhall uſe for the favour of the public, is, that I have as great a reſpect for it, as moſt authors have for themſelves; and that I have ſacrificed much of my own ſelf-love for its ſake, in preventing not only many mean things from ſeeing the light, but many which I thought tolerable. I would not be like thoſe Authors, who forgive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome particular lines for the ſake of a whole
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0902000401:31"/>
Poem, and <hi>vice verſa</hi> a whole Poem for the ſake of ſome particular lines. I believe no one qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo likely to make a good writer, as the power of rejecting his own thoughts; and it muſt be this (if any thing) that can give me a chance to be one. For what I have publiſhed, I can only hope to be pardon'd; but for what I have burn'd, I deſerve to be prais'd. On this account the world is under ſome obligation to me, and owes me the juſtice in return, to look upon no verſes as mine that are not inſerted in this collection. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps nothing could make it worth my while to own what are really ſo, but to avoid the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo many dull and immoral things, as partly by malice, and partly by ignorance, have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to me. I muſt farther acquit myſelf of the preſumption of having lent my name to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any Miſcellanies, or Works of other men; a thing I never thought becoming a perſon who has hardly credit enough to anſwer for his own.</p>
               <p>In this office of collecting my pieces, I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uncertain, whether to look upon myſelf as a man building a monument, or burying the dead.</p>
               <p>If Time ſhall make it the former, may theſe Poems (as long as they laſt) remain as a teſtimony, that their Author never made his talents ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the mean and unworthy ends of Party or Self-intereſt; the gratification of public prejudices, or private paſſions; the flattery of the undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0902000401:32"/>
or the inſult of the unfortunate. If I have written well, let it be conſider'd that 'tis what no man can do without good ſenſe, a quality that not only renders one capable of being a good writer, but a good man. And if I have made any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition in the opinion of any one under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former, let it be continued to me under no other title than that of the latter.</p>
               <p>But if this publication be only a more ſolemn funeral of my Remains, I deſire it may be known that I die in charity, and in my ſenſes; without any murmurs againſt the juſtice of this age, or any mad appeals to poſterity. I declare I ſhall think the world in the right, and quietly ſubmit to every truth which time ſhall diſcover to the prejudice of theſe writings; not ſo much as wiſhing ſo irrational a thing, as that every body ſhould be deceived merely for my credit. However, I deſire it may then be conſidered, That there are very few things in this collection which were not written under the age of five and twenty: ſo that my youth may be made (as it never fails to be in Executions) a caſe of compaſſion. That I was never ſo concerned about my works as to vindicate them in print, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, if any thing was good, it would defend it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and what was bad could never be defended. That I uſed no artifice to raiſe or continue a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, depreciated no dead author I was obliged to, bribed no living one with unjuſt praiſe, inſulted no adverſary with ill language; or when I could
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0902000401:33"/>
not attack a Rival's works, encouraged reports againſt his Morals. To conclude, if this volume periſh, let it ſerve as a warning to the Critics, not to take too much pains for the future to deſtroy ſuch things as will die of themſelves; and a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento mori</hi> to ſome of my vain contemporaries the Poets, to teach them that, when real merit is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it avails nothing to have been encouraged by the great, commended by the eminent, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the public in general.</p>

I'll therefore make this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face a general confeſſion of all my thoughts of my own Poetry, reſolving with the ſame freedom to
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0902000401:34"/>
expoſe myſelf, as it is in the power of any other to expoſe them. In the firſt place I thank God and nature, that I was born with a love to poetry; for nothing more conduces to fill up all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of our time, or, if rightly uſed, to make the whole courſe of life entertaining: <hi>Cantantes licet uſque (minus via laedet.)</hi> 'Tis a vaſt happineſs to poſſeſs the pleaſures of the head, the only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in which a man is ſufficient to himſelf, and the only part of him which, to his ſatisfaction, he can employ all day long. The Muſes are <hi>amicae omnium horarum;</hi> and, like our gay acquaintance, the beſt company in the world as long as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects no real ſervice from them. I confeſs there was a time when I was in love with myſelf, and my firſt productions were the children of ſelf love upon innocence. I had made an Epic Poem, and Panegyrics on all the Princes in Europe, and thought myſelf the greateſt genius that ever was. I can't but regret thoſe delightful viſions of my childhood, which, like the fine colours we ſee when our eyes are ſhut, are vaniſhed for ever. Many tryals and ſad experience have ſo undeceived me by degrees, that I am utterly at a loſs at what rate to value myſelf. As for fame I ſhall be glad of any I can get, and not repine at any I miſs; and as for vanity, I have enough to keep me from hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf, or even from wiſhing thoſe hanged who would take it away. It was this that made me write. The ſenſe of my faults made me cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect;

beſides that it was as pleaſant to me to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect as to write.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At p.</hi> vii. <hi>l.</hi> 9. In the firſt place I own that I have uſed my beſt endeavours to the finiſhing theſe pieces. That I made what advantage I could of the judgment of authors dead and living; and that I omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors by my friends and by my enemies. And that I expect no favour on account of my youth, buſineſs, want of health, or any ſuch idle excuſes. But the true reaſon they are not yet more correct is owing to the conſideration how ſhort a time they and I have to live. A man that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but ſixty years may be aſhamed to employ thirty in meaſuring ſyllables and bringing ſenſe and rhime together. We ſpend our youth in purſuit of riches or fame, in hopes to enjoy them when we are old; and when we are old, we find it is too late to enjoy any thing. I therefore hope the Wits will pardon me, if I reſerve ſome of my time to ſave my ſoul; and that <hi>ſome</hi> wiſe men will be of my opinion, even if I ſhould think a part of it better ſpent in the enjoyments of life than in pleaſing the critics.</p>

               <p>THERE are not, I believe, a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of any ſort of verſes than of thoſe which are called Paſtorals; nor a ſmaller, than of thoſe which are truly ſo. It therefore ſeems neceſſary to give ſome account of this kind of Poem, and it is my deſign to comprize in this ſhort paper the ſubſtance of thoſe numerous diſſertations the Critics have made on the ſubject, without omitting any of their rules in my own favour. You will alſo find ſome points reconciled, about which they ſeem to differ, and a few remarks, which, I think, have eſcaped their obſervation.</p>
               <p>The original of Poetry is aſcribed to that Age which ſucceeded the creation of the world: and as the keeping of flocks ſeems to have been the firſt employment of mankind, the moſt ancient ſort of poetry was probably <hi>paſtoral</hi>

                  </note>. It is natural to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0902000401:63"/>
imagine, that the leiſure of thoſe ancient ſhepherds admitting and inviting ſome diverſion, none was ſo proper to that ſolitary and ſedentary life as ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that in their ſongs they took occaſion to celebrate their own felicity. From hence a Poem was invented, and afterwards improved to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect image of that happy time; which by giving us an eſteem for the virtues of a former age, might recommend them to the preſent. And ſince the life of ſhepherds was attended with more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity than any other rural employment, the Poets choſe to introduce their Perſons, from whom it received the name of Paſtoral.</p>
               <p>A Paſtoral is an imitation of the action of a ſhepherd, or one conſidered under that character. The form of this imitation is dramatic, or narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or mixed of both<note n="c" place="bottom">

                     <bibl>P.</bibl>
                  </note>; the fable ſimple, the manners not too polite nor too ruſtic: the thoughts are plain, yet admit a little quickneſs and paſſion, but that ſhort and flowing: the expreſſion humble, yet as pure as the language will afford; neat, but not florid; eaſy, and yet lively. In ſhort, the fable, manners, thoughts, and expreſſions are full of the greateſt ſimplicity in nature.</p>
               <p>The complete character of this poem conſiſts in ſimplicity<note n="d" place="bottom">

                  </note>, brevity, and delicacy; the two firſt of which render an eclogue natural, and the laſt delightful.</p>

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0902000401:64"/>
If we would copy Nature, it may be uſeful to take this Idea along with us, that Paſtoral is an image of what they call the golden age. So that we are not to deſcribe our ſhepherds as ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds at this day really are, but as they may be conceived then to have been; when the beſt of men followed the employment. To carry this reſemblance yet farther, it would not be amiſs to give theſe ſhepherds ſome ſkill in aſtronomy, as far as it may be uſeful to that ſort of life. And an air of piety to the Gods ſhould ſhine through the Poem, which ſo viſibly appears in all the works of antiquity: and it ought to preſerve ſome reliſh of the old way of writing; the connection ſhould be looſe, the narrations and deſcriptions ſhort<note n="e" place="bottom">

                  </note>, and the periods conciſe. Yet it is not ſufficient, that the ſentences only be brief, the whole Eclogue ſhould be ſo too. For we cannot ſuppoſe Poetry in thoſe days to have been the buſineſs of men, but their

Nor is it enough to introduce ſhepherds diſcourſing together in a natural way; but a regard muſt be had to the ſubject; that it contain ſome particular beauty in itſelf, and that it be different in every Eclogue.

                  </note>. This variety is obtained in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree by frequent compariſons, drawn from the moſt agreeable objects of the country; by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations to things inanimate; by beautiful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, but thoſe ſhort; ſometimes by inſiſting a little on circumſtances; and laſtly, by elegant turns on the words, which render the numbers extremely ſweet and pleaſing.

               <p>It is by rules like theſe that we ought to judge of Paſtoral. And ſince the inſtructions given for any art are to be delivered as that art is in perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they muſt of neceſſity be derived from thoſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0902000401:66"/>
in whom it is acknowledged ſo to be. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the practice of Theocritus and Virgil (the only undiſputed authors of Paſtoral) that the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics have drawn the foregoing notions concerning it.</p>
               <p>Theocritus excels all others in nature and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. The ſubjects of his Idyllia are purely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral; but he is not ſo exact in his perſons, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing introduced reapers <note n="i" place="bottom">

                     <bibl>P.</bibl>
                  </note> and fiſhermen as well as ſhepherds. He is apt to be too long in his deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, of which that of the Cup in the firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral is a remarkable inſtance. In the manners he ſeems a little defective, for his ſwains are ſometimes abuſive and immodeſt, and perhaps too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to ruſticity; for inſtance, in his fourth and fifth Idyllia. But 'tis enough that all others learnt their excellencies from him, and that his Dialect alone has a ſecret charm in it, which no other could ever attain.</p>
               <p>Virgil, who copies Theocritus, refines upon his original: and in all points where judgment is principally concerned, he is much ſuperior to his maſter. Though ſome of his ſubjects are not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral in themſelves, but only ſeem to be ſuch; they have a wonderful variety in them, which the Greek was a ſtranger to<note n="k" place="bottom">

                  </note>. He exceeds him in regularity and brevity, and falls ſhort of him in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0902000401:67"/>
nothing but ſimplicity and propriety of ſtyle; the firſt of which perhaps was the fault of his age, and the laſt of his language.</p>
               <p>Among the moderns, their ſucceſs has been greateſt who have moſt endeavoured to make theſe ancients their pattern. The moſt conſiderable Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius appears in the famous Taſſo, and our Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. Taſſo in his Aminta has as far excelled all the Paſtoral writers, as in his Gieruſalemme he has out-done the Epic poets of his country. But as this piece ſeems to have been the original of a new ſort of poem, the Paſtoral Comedy, in Italy, it cannot ſo well be conſidered as a copy of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. Spenſer's Calendar, in Mr. Dryden's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is the moſt complete work of this kind which any nation has produced ever ſince the time of Virgil<note n="1" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Dedication to Virg. Ecl.</bibl> 
                     <bibl>P.</bibl>
                  </note>. Not but that he may be thought imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in ſome few points. His Eclogues are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too long, if we compare them with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. He is ſometimes too allegorical, and treats of matters of religion in a paſtoral ſtyle, as Mantuan had done before him. He has employed the Lyric meaſure, which is contrary to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the old Poets. His Stanza is not ſtill the ſame, nor always well choſen. This laſt may be the reaſon his expreſſion is ſometimes not conciſe enough: for the Tetraſtic has obliged him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his ſenſe to the length of four lines, which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0902000401:68"/>
would have been more cloſely confined in the Couplet.</p>
               <p>In the manners, thoughts, and characters, he comes near to Theocritus himſelf; tho', notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the care he has taken, he is certainly inferior in his Dialect: For the Doric had its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and propriety in the Time of Theocritus; it was uſed in part of Greece, and frequent in the mouths of many of the greateſt perſons: whereas the old Engliſh and country phraſes of Spenſer were either entirely obſolete, or ſpoken only by people of the loweſt condition. As there is a difference betwixt ſimplicity and ruſticity, ſo the expreſſion of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thoughts ſhould be plain, but not clowniſh. The addition he has made of a Calendar to his Eclogues, is very beautiful; ſince by this, beſides the general moral of innocence and ſimplicity, which is common to other authors of Paſtoral, he has one peculiar to himſelf; he compares human Life to the ſeveral Seaſons, and at once expoſes to his readers a view of the great and little worlds, in their various changes and aſpects. Yet the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous diviſion of his Paſtorals into Months, has obliged him either to repeat the ſame deſcription, in other words, for three months together; or, when it was exhauſted before, entirely to omit it: whence it comes to paſs that ſome of his Eclogues (as the ſixth, eighth, and tenth for example) have nothing but their Titles to diſtinguiſh them. The reaſon is evident, becauſe the year has not that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0902000401:69"/>
in it to furniſh every month with a particular deſcription, as it may every ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Of the following Eclogues I ſhall only ſay, that theſe four comprehend all the ſubjects which the Critics upon Theocritus and Virgil will allow to be fit for paſtoral: That they have as much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of deſcription, in reſpect of the ſeveral ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as Spenſer's: that in order to add to this variety, the ſeveral times of the day are obſerv'd, the rural employments in each ſeaſon or time of day, and the rural ſcenes or places proper to ſuch employments; not without ſome regard to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ages of man, and the different paſſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to each age.</p>
               <p>But after all, if they have any merit, it is to be attributed to ſome good old Authors, whoſe works as I had leiſure to ſtudy, ſo I hope I have not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed care to imitate.</p>

                  <p xml:id="CT005432PT1.P1-RA">Theſe Paſtorals were written at the age of ſixteen, and then paſt thro' the hands of Mr. <hi>Walſh,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wycherley, G. Granville</hi> afterwards Lord <hi>Lanſdown,</hi> Sir <hi>William Trumbal,</hi> Dr. <hi>Garth,</hi> Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> Lord <hi>Somers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mainwaring,</hi> and others. All theſe gave our Author the greateſt encouragement, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Mr. <hi>Walſh</hi> (whom Mr. Dryden, in his Poſtſcript to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, calls the beſt critic of his age.) <q rend="inline">"The Author (ſays he) ſeems to have a particular genius for this kind of Poetry, and a judgment that much exceeds his years. He has taken very
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0902000401:71"/>
very freely from the Ancients. But what he has mixed of his own with theirs is no way inferior to what he has taken from them. It is not flattery at all to ſay that Virgil had written nothing ſo good at his Age. His Preface is very judicious and learned."</q> 
                     <hi>Letter to Mr. Wycherley, Ap.</hi> 1705. The Lord Lanſdown about the ſame time, mentioning the youth of our Poet, ſays (in a printed Letter of the Character of Mr. Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherley) <q rend="inline">"that if he goes on as he has begun in the Paſtoral way, as Virgil firſt tried his ſtrength, we may hope to ſee Engliſh Poety vie with the Roman,"</q> etc.   Notwithſtanding the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly time of their production, the Author eſteemed theſe as the moſt correct in the verſification, and muſical in the numbers, of all his works. The reaſon for his labouring them into ſo much ſoftneſs, was, doubtleſs, that this ſort of poetry derives almoſt its whole beauty from a natural eaſe of thought and ſmoothneſs of verſe; whereas that of moſt other kinds conſiſts in the ſtrength and fulneſs of both. In a letter of his to Mr. <hi>Walſh</hi> about this time we find an enumeration of ſeveral Niceties in Verſification, which perhaps have never been ſtrictly obſerved in any <hi>Engliſh</hi> poem, except in theſe Paſtorals. They were not printed till 1709. <bibl>P.</bibl>

               <p>IN reading ſeveral paſſages of the Prophet Iſaiah, which foretell the coming of Chriſt and the felicities attending it, I could not but obſerve a remarkable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between many of the thoughts, and thoſe in the Pollio of Virgil. This will not ſeem ſurpriſing, when we reflect, that the Eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the ſame ſubject. One may judge that Virgil did not copy it line by line, but ſelected ſuch ideas as beſt agreed with the nature of paſtoral poetry, and diſpoſed them in that manner which ſerved moſt to beautify his piece. I have endeavoured the ſame in this imitation of him, though without admitting any thing of my own; ſince it was written with this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular view, that the reader, by comparing the ſeveral thoughts, might ſee how far the images and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Prophet are ſuperior to thoſe of the Poet. But as I fear I have prejudiced them by my management, I ſhall ſubjoin the paſſages of Iſaiah, and thoſe of Virgil, under the ſame diſadvantage of a literal tranſlation. <bibl>P.</bibl>

                     <hi>An Eſſay</hi>]</q> The Poem is in one book, but divided into three principals parts or members. The firſt [to ℣ 201.] gives rules for the <hi>Study of the Art of Criticiſm:</hi> the ſecond [from thence to ℣ 560.] expoſes the <hi>Cauſes of wrong Judgment;</hi> and the third [from thence to the end] preſcribes the <hi>Morals of the Critic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to a right underſtanding of this poem, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve, that tho' it be intitled ſimply <hi>an Eſſay on Criticiſm,</hi> yet ſeveral of the precepts relate equally to the good <hi>writing</hi> as well as to the true <hi>judging</hi> of a poem. This is ſo far from violating the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Subject, that it rounds and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats it: or from diſordering the regularity of the <hi>Form,</hi> that it produces the higheſt beauty which can ariſe out of method, as will appear by the following conſiderations: 1. It was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give a full and exact idea of the <hi>Art of poetical Criticiſm,</hi> without conſidering, at the ſame time, the <hi>Art of Poetry;</hi> ſo far as Poetry is an <hi>Art.</hi> Theſe therefore being cloſely connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in nature, the Author has with much judgment reciprocally
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0902000401:160"/>
interwoven the precepts of both thro' his whole poem. 2. As all the rules of the ancient Critics were taken from Poets who copied nature, this is another reaſon why every Poet ſhould be a Critic: Therefore, as the ſubject is <hi>poetical Criticiſm,</hi> it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently addreſſed to the <hi>critical Poet.</hi> And 3dly, the Art of Criticiſm is as neceſſarily, and much more uſefully exerciſed in <hi>writing</hi> than in <hi>judging.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Readers have been miſled by the modeſty of the <hi>Title:</hi> which only promiſes an Art of <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> in a treatiſe, and that a compleat one, of the Art both of <hi>Criticiſm</hi> and <hi>Poetry.</hi> This, and the not attending to the conſiderations offered above, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was what miſled a very candid writer, after having given this Piece all the praiſes on the ſide of genius and poetry which his true taſte could not reſuſe it, to ſay, that <hi>the obſervations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one another like thoſe in</hi> Horace's Art of Poetry, <hi>without that methodical regularity which would have been requiſite in a proſe writer.</hi> Spec. No 235. I do not ſee how <hi>method</hi> can hurt any one grace of Poetry; or what prerogative there is in verſe to to diſpenſe with <hi>regularity.</hi> The remark is falſe in every part of it. Mr. Pope's <hi>Eſſay on Criticiſm,</hi> the Reader will ſoon ſee, is a regular piece: And a very learned Critic has lately ſhewn, that <hi>Horace</hi> had the ſame attention to method in his <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0902000401:161"/>
ſhewn us the expediency of his ſubject, the Art of <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> next inquires [from ℣ 8 to 15] into the neceſſary <hi>Qualities</hi> of a <hi>true Critic:</hi> And obſerves firſt, that JUDGMENT, ſimply and alone, is not ſufficient to conſtitute this character, becauſe <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> like the <hi>artificial meaſures of Time,</hi> goes different, and yet each relies upon his own. The reaſon is concluſive; and the ſimilitude extremely juſt. For <hi>Judgment,</hi> when alone, is always regulated, or at leaſt much inflenced by cuſtom, faſhion, and habit; and never certain and conſtant but when ſounded upon TASTE: which is the ſame in the <hi>Critic,</hi> as GENIUS in the <hi>Poet:</hi> both are derived from Heaven, and like the Sun (the <hi>natural meaſure of Time)</hi> always conſtant and equal.</p>
               <p>Nor need we wonder that Judgment alone will not make a Critic in poetry, when we ſee that it will not make a Poet. And on examination we ſhall find, that <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Taſte</hi> are but one and the ſame faculty, differently exerting itſelf under different names, in the two proſeſſions of <hi>Poet</hi> and <hi>Critic.</hi> For the Art of Poetry conſiſts in <hi>ſelecting,</hi> out of all thoſe images which preſent themſelves to the fancy, ſuch of them as are truly poetical: And the Art of Criticiſm in judiciouſly diſcerning, and fully reliſhing what it finds ſo ſelected. 'Tis the ſame opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind in both caſes, and conſequently, exerted by the ſame faculty. All the difference is, that in the Poet this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is eminently joined with a <hi>bright imagination,</hi> and <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive comprehenſion,</hi> which provide ſtores for the ſelection, and can form that ſelection, by proportioned parts, into a regular whole: In the Critic, with a <hi>ſolid judgment</hi> and <hi>accurate diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> which penetrate into the cauſes of an excellence, and can ſhew that excellence in all its variety of lights. <hi>Longinus</hi> had <hi>taſte</hi> in an eminent degree; ſo this, which is indeed common to all true Critics, our Author makes his diſtinguiſhing character,

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0902000401:163"/>
occaſioning thoſe diſorders before objected to it. He owns, that the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> are indeed ſown in the minds of moſt men, but by ill culture, as it ſprings up, it generally runs wild: either on the one hand, by <hi>falſe knowledge</hi> which pedants call <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;</hi> or by <hi>falſe reaſoning</hi> which Philoſophers call <hi>School-learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> Or on the other, by <hi>falſe wit</hi> which is not regulated by <hi>ſenſe;</hi> or by <hi>falſe politeneſs</hi> which is ſolely regulated by the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.</hi> Both theſe ſorts, who have their Judgments thus doubly

VER. 46. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>But you who ſeek, etc.</hi>]</q> Our author having thus far, by way of INTRODUCTION, explained the nature, uſe, and abuſe of <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> in a figurative deſcription of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and characters of <hi>Critics,</hi> proceeds now to deliver the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Art. The firſt of which, from ℣ 47 to 68. is, that he who ſets up for a Critic ſhould previouſly examine his own ſtrength, and ſee how far he is qualified for the exerciſe of his profeſſion. He puts him in a way to make this diſcovery, in that admirable direction given ℣ 51.<q>AND MARK THAT POINT WHERE SENSE AND DULNESS MEET.</q> He had ſhewn above, that <hi>Judgment,</hi> without <hi>Taſte</hi> or <hi>Genius,</hi> is equally incapable of making a Critic or a Poet: In whatſoever ſubject then the Critic's <hi>Taſte</hi> no longer accompanies his <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> there he may be aſſured he is going out of his depth. This our author finely calls,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>that point where ſenſe and dulneſs meet.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
And immediately adds the REASON of his precept; the Author of Nature having ſo conſtituted the mental faculties, that one of them can never excel but at the expence of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0902000401:167"/>
From this ſtate and ordination of the mental faculties, and the influence and effects they have one on another, our Poet draws this CONSEQUENCE, that no one genius can excell in more than one Art or Science. The <hi>conſequence</hi> ſhews the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the precept, juſt as the <hi>premiſſes,</hi> from which it is drawn, ſhew the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of it.</p>

VER. 68. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Firſt follow Nature, etc</hi>]</q> The Critic obſerving the directions here given, and finding himſelf qualified for his office, is ſhewn next <hi>how</hi> to exerciſe it. And as he was to attend to <hi>Nature</hi> for a <hi>Call,</hi> ſo he is firſt and principally to follow her when <hi>called.</hi> And here again in this, as in the foregoing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, the poet [from ℣ 67 to 88.] ſhews both the <hi>fitneſs</hi> and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it. It's <hi>fitneſs,</hi> 1. Becauſe Nature is the <hi>ſource</hi> of poetic Art; that Art being only a repreſentation of Nature, who is its great exemplar and original. 2. Becauſe Nature is the <hi>end</hi> of Art; the deſign of poetry being to convey the knowledge of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0902000401:169"/>
Nature in the moſt agreeable manner. 3. Becauſe Nature is the <hi>teſt</hi> of Art, as ſhe is unerring, conſtant, and ſtill the ſame. Hence the poet obſerves, that as Nature is the <hi>ſource,</hi> ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys <hi>life</hi> to Art: As ſhe is the <hi>end,</hi> ſhe conveys <hi>force</hi> to it, for the <hi>force</hi> of any thing ariſes from its being directed to its <hi>end:</hi> And, as ſhe is the <hi>teſt,</hi> ſhe conveys <hi>beauty</hi> to it, for every thing acquires <hi>beauty</hi> by its being reduced to its true <hi>ſtandard.</hi> Such is the ſenſe of thoſe two important lines,
<q>
                     <l>Life, force, <hi>and</hi> beauty <hi>muſt to all impart,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>At once the</hi> ſource, <hi>and</hi> end, <hi>and</hi> teſt <hi>of Art.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
We now come to the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the Precept. The two great conſtituent qualities of a <hi>Compoſition,</hi> as ſuch, are <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Wit:</hi> But neither of theſe attains perfection, 'till the firſt be <hi>hid,</hi> and the other judiciouſly <hi>reſtrained;</hi> which is only then when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is exactly followed; for then Art never makes a parade, nor can Wit commit an extravagance. Art, while it <hi>adheres</hi> to Nature, and has ſo large a <hi>fund</hi> in the reſources which Nature ſupplies, diſpoſes every thing with ſo much <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> that we ſee nothing but thoſe natural images it works with, while itſelf ſtands unobſerv'd behind: But when Art <hi>leaves</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, deluded either by the bold extravagance of Fancy, or the quaint odneſſes of Faſhion, ſhe is then obliged at every ſtep to come forward, in a painful or pompous oſtentation, in order to cover, to ſoften, or to regulate the ſhocking diſproportion of <hi>unnatural</hi> images. In the <hi>firſt</hi> caſe, the poet compares Art to the Soul within, informing a beauteous Body; but we general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find it, in the <hi>laſt,</hi> only like the outward Habit, bolſtering up, by the Taylor's ſkill, the defects of a mis-ſhapen one.—As to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0902000401:170"/>
                  <hi>Wit,</hi> it might perhaps be imagined that this needed only <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to govern it: But, as he well obſerves,
<q>
                     <l>Wit <hi>and</hi> Judgment <hi>often are at ſtrife,</hi>
                     </l>

                     </l>
                  </q>
They want therefore ſome friendly Mediator or Reconciler, which is <hi>Nature:</hi> And in attending to her, the Judgment will learn where to comply with the charms of Wit, and the Wit how to obey the ſage directions of Judgment.</p>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0902000401:172"/>
illuſtrate the beauties of the beſt Writers, in order to excite others to an emulation of their excellence. From the admiration which theſe Ideas raiſe in him, the poet is naturally brought back to reflect on the degeneracy of modern Criticiſm: And as the reſtoring the Art to its original integrity and ſplendor is the great purpoſe of his poem, he firſt takes notice of thoſe, who ſeem not to underſtand that <hi>Nature</hi> is exhauſtleſs, that <hi>new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> of good writing may be produced in every age, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently <hi>new rules</hi> may be formed from theſe models in the ſame manner as the old Critics formed theirs, from the writings of the ancient Poets: but theſe men wanting art and ability to form theſe <hi>new rules,</hi> are content to receive, and file up for uſe, the <hi>old ones</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle, Quintilian, Longinus, Horace, etc.</hi> with the ſame vanity and boldneſs that Apothecaries practiſe with their Doctors bills: And thus raſhly applying them to <hi>new Originals</hi> (caſes which they did not hit) it was no more in their power than their inclination to imitate the candid practice of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi> when
<q>

                     </l>
                  </q>
'Tis the buſineſs of reaſon, he tells us, to diſpel the <hi>cloud</hi> which pride throws over the mind: But the miſchief is, that the rays of reaſon, diverted by ſelf-love, ſometimes <hi>gild</hi> this <hi>cloud,</hi> inſtead of <hi>diſſipating</hi> it. So that the Judgment, by falſe lights reflected back upon itſelf, is ſtill apt to be a little dazzled, and to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take its object.

<q>
                     <l>Truſt not yourſelf; <hi>but your defects to know,</hi>

                  </q>
Both the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>concluſion</hi> of this precept are remarkable. The queſtion is of the means to ſubdue Pride: He directs the Critic to begin with a <hi>diſtruſt of himſelf;</hi> and this is <hi>Modeſty,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> mortification of Pride: And then to ſeek the aſſiſtance of others, and <hi>make uſe even of an Enemy;</hi> and this is <hi>Humility,</hi> the <hi>laſt</hi> mortification of Pride: For when a man can once bring himſelf to ſubmit to profit by an enemy, he has either already quite ſubdued his Vanity, or is in a fair way of ſo doing.</p>

to <hi>enjoy their exiſtence</hi> early. He compares the life of <hi>modern Wit,</hi> and of the <hi>ancient,</hi> which ſurvives in an univerſal language, to the difference between the Patriarchal age and our own: And obſerves, that while the ancient writings live for ever, as it were in braſs and marble, the modern are but like <hi>Paintings,</hi> which, of how maſterly a hand ſoever, have no ſooner gained their requiſite perfection by the incorporating, ſoftening, and ripening of their tints, which they do in a very few years, but they begin to fade and die away. 3. Laſtly, our author ſhews, that the Critic ought to do this ſervice <hi>out of regard to the Poet;</hi> when he conſiders the ſlender dowry the Muſe brings along with her: In <hi>youth</hi> 'tis only a ſhort lived vanity; and in <hi>maturer years</hi> an acceſſion of care and labour, in proportion to the weight of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to be ſuſtained, and of the increaſe of Envy to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: And concludes his reaſoning therefore on this head, with that pathetic and inſinuating addreſs to the Critic, from 508 to 524.<q>

But if the four critical humour muſt needs have vent, he points to its right object; and ſhews [from ℣ 526 to 556.] how it may be uſefully and innocently diverted. This is very obſervable; for our author makes ſpleen and diſdain the characteriſtic of the <hi>falſe Critic,</hi> and yet here ſuppoſes them inherent in the <hi>true.</hi> But it is done with judgment, and a knowledge of nature. For as bitterneſs and acerbity in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe fruits of the beſt kind are the foundation and capacity of that high ſpirit, race, and flavour which we find in them, when perfectly concocted by the heat and influence of the Sun; and which, without thoſe qualities, would often gain no more by that influence than only a <hi>mellow inſipidity:</hi> ſo ſpleen and diſdain in the true Critic, improved by long ſtudy and experience, ripen into an exactneſs of Judgment and an elegance of Taſte: But, lying in the falſe Critic remote from
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0902000401:216"/>
the influence of good letters, continue in all their firſt offenſive harſhneſs and aſtringency. The Poet therefore ſhews how, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the exaltation of theſe qualities into their ſtate of perfection, the very <hi>Dregs</hi> (which, tho' precipitated, may poſſibly, on ſome occaſions, riſe and ferment even in a <hi>noble mind)</hi> may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employed in branding OBSCENITY and IMPIETY. Of theſe he explains the riſe and progreſs, in a beautiful picture of the different genius's of the reigns of <hi>Charles</hi> II. and <hi>William</hi> III. the former of which gave courſe to the moſt <hi>profligate luxury;</hi> the latter to a <hi>licentious impiety.</hi> Theſe are the criminals the poet aſſigns over to the cauſtic hand of the Critic, but concludes however, from ℣ 556 to 561. with this neceſſary admonition, to take care not to be miſled into unjuſt cenſure; either on the one hand, by a phariſaical <hi>niceneſs,</hi> or on the other by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of guilt.

               <p>IT will be in vain to deny that I have ſome regard for this piece, ſince I dedicate it to You. Yet you may bear me witneſs, it was intended only to divert a few young Ladies, who have good ſenſe and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour enough to laugh not only at their ſex's little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded follies, but at their own. But as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the air of a Secret, it ſoon found its way into the world. An imperfect copy having been offer'd to a Bookſeller, you had the good-nature for my ſake to conſent to the publication of one more correct: This I was forc'd to, before I had executed half my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, for the Machinery was entirely wanting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it.</p>
               <p>The Machinery, Madam, is a term invented by the Critics, to ſignify that part which the Deities, Angels, or Daemons are made to act in a Poem: For the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets are in one reſpect like many modern Ladies: let an action be never ſo trivial in itſelf, they always make it appear of the utmoſt importance. Theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines I determin'd to raiſe on a very new and odd foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the Roſicrucian doctrine of Spirits.</p>
               <p>I know how diſagreeable it is to make uſe of hard words before a Lady; but 'tis ſo much the concern of a Poet to have his works underſtood, and particularly by your Sex, that you muſt give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms.</p>
               <p>The Roſicrucians are a people I muſt bring you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. The beſt account I know of them is in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0902000401:236"/>
a French book call'd <hi>Le Comte de Gabalis,</hi> which both in its title and ſize is ſo like a Novel, that many of the Fair Sex have read it for one by miſtake. According to theſe Gentlemen, the four Elements are inhabited by Spirits, which they call Sylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs, and Salamanders. The Gnomes or Daemons of Earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in miſchief; but the Sylphs, whoſe habitation is in the Air, are the beſt-condition'd creatures imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For they ſay, any mortals may enjoy the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate familiarities with theſe gentle Spirits, upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition very eaſy to all true Adepts, an inviolate preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Chaſtity.</p>
               <p>As to the following Canto's, all the paſſages of them are as fabulous, as the Viſion at the beginning, or the Transformation at the end; (except the loſs of your Hair, which I always mention with reverence.) The Human perſons are as fictitious as the Airy ones; and the character of Belinda, as it is now manag'd, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles you in nothing but in Beauty.</p>
               <p>If this Poem had as many Graces as there are in your Perſon, or in your Mind, yet I could never hope it ſhould paſs thro' the world half ſo Uncenſur'd as You have done. But let its fortune be what it will, mine is happy enough, to have given me this occaſion of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring you that I am, with the trueſt eſteem,</p>

                           <p>It appears, by this Motto, that the following Poem was written or publiſhed at the Lady's requeſt. But there are ſome further circumſtances not unworthy relating. Mr. Caryl (a Gentleman who was Secretary to Queen Mary, wife of James II. whoſe fortunes he followed into France, Author of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of <hi>Sir Solomon Single,</hi> and of ſeveral tranſlations in Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's Miſcellanies) originally propoſed the ſubject to him in a view of putting an end, by this piece of ridicule, to a quarrel that was riſen between two noble Families, thoſe of Lord Petre and of Mrs. Fermor, on the trifling occaſion of his having cut off a lock of her hair. The Author ſent it to the Lady, with whom he was acquainted; and ſhe took it ſo well as to give about co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of it. That firſt ſketch, (we learn from one of his Letters) was written in leſs than a fortnight, in 1711. in two Canto's only, and it was ſo printed; firſt, in a Miſcellany of Bern. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tot's, without the name of the Author. But it was received ſo well that he made it more conſiderable the next year by the addition of the machinery of the Sylphs, and extended it to five Canto's. We ſhall give the reader the pleaſure of ſeeing in what manner theſe additions were inſerted, ſo as to ſeem not to be added, but to grow out of the Poem. See Notes, Cant.

                           <hi>Her Guardian Sylph</hi>]</q> When Mr. Pope had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to give this Poem its preſent form, he was obliged to find it with its Machinery. For as the ſubject of the Epic Poem conſiſts of two parts, the <hi>metaphyſical</hi> and the <hi>civil;</hi> ſo this mock epic, which is of the ſatiric kind, and receives its grace from a ludicrous imitation of the other's pomp and ſolemnity, was to have the ſame diviſion of the ſubject. And, as the <hi>civil</hi> part is intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally debaſed by the choice of an inſignificant action: ſo ſhould the <hi>metaphyſical,</hi> by the uſe of ſome very extravagant ſyſtem. A rule, which tho' neither Boileau nor Garth have been careful enough to attend to, our Author's good ſenſe would not ſuffer him to overlook. And that ſort of Machinery which his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taught him was only fit for his uſe, his admirable inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſupplied. There was but one Syſtem in all nature which was to his purpoſe, the <hi>Roſicrucian Philoſophy;</hi> and this, by the well directed effort of his imagination, he preſently ſeized upon. The fanatic Alchemiſts, in their ſearch after the great ſecret, had invented a <hi>means</hi> altogether proportioned to their <hi>end.</hi> It was a kind of Theological-Philoſophy, made up of almoſt equal mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Pagan Platoniſm, Chriſtian Quietiſm, and the Jewiſh Cabbala; a compoſition enough to fright Reaſon from human commerce. This general ſyſtem, he tells us, he took as he found it in a little French tract called, <hi>Le Comte de Gabalis.</hi> This book is written in Dialogue, and is a delicate and very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

piece of raillery of the Abbe Villiers, upon that inviſible ſect, of which the ſtories that went about at that time, made a great deal of noiſe at Paris. But, as in this ſatirical Dialogue, Mr. P. found ſeveral whimſies, of a very high myſterious kind, told of the nature of theſe elementary beings, which were very unfit to come into the machinery of ſuch a ſort of poem, he has with great judgment omitted them; and in their ſtead, made uſe of the Legendary ſtories of Guardian Angels, and the Nurſery Tales of the Fairies; which he has artfully accommodated to the reſt of the <hi>Roſicrucian Syſtem.</hi> And to this, (unleſs we will be ſo uncharitable to believe he intended to give a needleſs ſcandal) we muſt ſuppoſe he referred, in theſe two lines,
<q>
                           <l>
                              <hi>If e'er one Viſion touch'd thy infant thought,</hi>

                        </q>
Thus, by the moſt beautiful invention imaginable, he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that, as in the ſerious Epic. the popular belief ſupports the Machinery; ſo, in his mock Epic, the Machinery ſhould be contrived to diſmount philoſophic pride and arrogance.</p>
