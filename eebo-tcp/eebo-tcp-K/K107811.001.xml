            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the firſt edition of theſe Poems, the Author concludes his Preface with theſe words,—<hi>It is with great diffidence that I add my literary Mite to the Treaſury of Engliſh Poetry.</hi>—In analogy to this humble metaphor, we will venture to
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0087601101:3"/>aſſert, that the Mite is no counterſeit coin; that it is not debaſed by an admixture of any improper alloy; and that it came from the Poetic Mint impreſſed with the Image of Nature.</p>

               <p>THE MAGDALEN Charity was eſtabliſhed in the year 1758. A commodious habitation was engaged, in PRESCOT STREET, by the promoters of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent inſtitution, and the houſe was opened on the tenth of Auguſt, when eight unhappy objects were admitted.</p>
               <p>In the year 1772, the Charity was removed to a more ſpacious building in ST. GEORGE'S FIELDS.</p>

               <p>CHRISTIERN the Second, king of Denmark, offered to appear in perſon at Stockholm, to frame a treaty of peace, provided GUSTAVUS VASA remained a hoſtage on board the Daniſh fleet. The king having by this ſtratagem ſecured the illuſtrious Swede, forcibly carried him away to Denmark, where he was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned for a conſiderable time. GUSTAVUS at length found means of eſcaping from his confinement; and travelling through Sweden in diſguiſe, was received by SUVERDSIO, a poor country curate, who, at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his life, concealed him in the pariſh church, and informed him of every thing that had happened in Sweden during his abſence, particularly of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of the ſenate at Stockholm, in which the father of GUSTAVUS was included.</p>
