            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. Of the Shell of Teſtaceous Fiſhes.</head>
               <p>ONE is apt to combine very diſſimilar objects in the ſame
groupe, when hurried into the vortex of method. No two animals are more unlike
each other than the whale and the limpet, the tortoiſe and the oyſter. Yet,
as theſe animals muſt find ſome place in the picture of animated nature,
it is beſt to let them reſt in the ſtation where the generality of
mankind have aſſigned them; and as they have been willing to give them all
from their abode the name of fiſhes, it is wiſeſt in us to conform.</p>
               <p>But before I enter into any hiſtory of ſhell-fiſh, it may
not be improper to obſerve, that <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0824000107:5"/> naturaliſts who have
treated on this part of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, have entirely attended to outward forms;
and, as in many other inſtances, forſaking the deſcription of the animal
itſelf, have exhauſted all their induſtry in deſcribing the habitation.
In conſequence of this radical error, we have volumes written upon the
ſubject of ſhells, and very little ſaid on the hiſtory of
ſhell-fiſh. The life of theſe induſtrious creatures, that for the
moſt part creep along the bottom, or immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably wait till driven as the
waves happen to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, is almoſt entirely unknown. The wreath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their
ſhells, or the ſpots with which they are tinctured, have been deſcribed
with a moſt diſguſting prolixity; but their appetites and their combats,
their eſcapes and humble arts of ſubſiſtence, have been utterly
neglected.</p>
               <p>As I have only undertaken to write the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of animated
nature, the variety of ſhells, and their peculiar ſpots or blemiſhes, do
not come within my deſign. However, the manner in which ſhells are formed
is a part of natural hiſtory connected with my plan, as it pre-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
vital force or induſtry in the animal that forms them.</p>
               <p>The ſhell may be conſidered as an habitation ſupplied by
nature. It is an hard ſtony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, made up ſomewhat in the manner
of a <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0824000107:6"/> wall. Part of the ſtony ſubſtance the animal
derives from outward objects, and the fluids of the animal itſelf furniſh
the cement. Theſe united make that firm covering which ſhell-fiſh
generally reſide in till they die.</p>
               <p>But, in order to give a more exact idea of the manner in which
ſea-ſhells are formed, we muſt have recourſe to an animal that lives
upon land, with the formation of whoſe ſhell we are beſt acquainted. This
is the garden-ſnail, that carries its box upon its back, whoſe hiſtory
Swammerdam has taken ſuch endleſs pains to deſcribe. As the manner of the
formation of this animal's ſhell extends to that of all others that have
ſhells, whether they live upon land or in the water, it will be proper to
give it a place before we enter upon the hiſtory of teſtaceous
fiſhes.</p>
               <p>To begin with the animal in its earlieſt ſtate, and trace
the progreſs of its ſhell from the time it firſt appears—The
inſtant the young ſnail leaves the egg, it carries its ſhell or its box
no its back. It does not leave the egg till it is arrived at a certain growth,
when its little ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation is ſufficiently hardened. This beginning of the
ſhell is not much bigger than a pin's head, but grows in a very rapid manner,
having at <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0824000107:7"/> firſt but two circumvolutions, for the reſt
are added as the ſnail grows larger. In proportion as the animal encreaſes
in ſize, the circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſhell encreaſe alſo, until the
number of thoſe volutes come to be five, which is never exceeded.</p>
               <p>The part where the animal enlarges its ſhell is at the mouth,
to which it adds in proportion as it finds itſelf ſtinted in its habitation
below. Being about to enlarge its ſhell, it is ſeen with its little teeth
biting and clearing away the ſcaly ſkin that grows at the edges. It is
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen to eat thoſe bits it thus takes off; at other times it
only cleans away the margin when covered with films, and then adds another rim
to its ſhell.</p>
               <p>For the purpoſes of making the ſhell, which is natural to
the animal, and without which it could not live three days, its whole body is
furniſhed with glands, from the orifices of which flows out a kind of ſlimy
fluid, like ſmall ſpiders threads, which join together in one common
cruſt or ſurface, and in time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe and acquire a ſtony hardneſs.
It is this ſlimy humour that grows into a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane and afterwards a ſtony
ſkin; nor can it have eſcaped any who have obſerved the track of a
ſnail; that gliſtening ſubſtance <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0824000107:8"/> which it leaves on
the floor or the wall is no other than the materials with which the animal adds
to its ſhell, or repairs it when broken.</p>
               <p>Now to exhibit in a more ſatisfactory manner the method in
which the ſhell is formed,—The ſnail burſts from its egg with its
ſhell upon its back; this ſhell, though very ſimple, is the center round
which every ſucceeding convolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſhell is formed, by new circles
added to the firſt. As the body of the ſnail can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no where but
to the aperture, the mouth of the ſhell only can of conſequence receive
augmentation. The ſubſtance of which the ſhell is compoſed is chiefly
ſupplied by the animal itſelf, and is no more than a ſlimy fluid which
hardens into bone. This fluid paſſes through an infinite number of little
glands till it arrives at the pores of the ſkin; but there it is ſtopped by
the ſhell that covers the part below; and therefore is ſent to the mouth of
the ſhell, where it is wanted for its enlargement. There the firſt layer of
ſlime ſoon hardens; and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is added, which hardens alſo, till
in time the ſhell becomes as thick as is requiſite for the animal's
preſervation. Thus every ſhell may be conſidered as compoſed of a
number of layers of ſlime, which have entirely proceeded from the animal's
own body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0824000107:9"/>But though this be the general opinion with
regard to the formation of ſhells, I cannot avoid thinking there are ſtill
other ſubſtances beſide the animal's own ſlime which go to the
compoſition of its ſhell, or at leaſt to its external coat, which is ever
different from the internal. The ſubſtances I mean are the accidental
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions of earthy or ſaline parts, which adhere to the ſlimy matter
upon its firſt emiſſion. By adopting this theory, we can more
ſatisfactorily account for the various colours of the ſhell, which cannot
be ſuppoſed to take its tincture from the animal's body, as is the uſual
opinion; for all the internal parts of the ſhell are but of one white colour;
it is only the outermoſt layer of the ſhell that is ſo beautifully
varied, ſo richly tinctured with that variety of colours we behold in the
cabinets of the curious. If the external coat be ſcaled off, as Mr.
Argenville aſſerts, all the inner ſubſtance will be found but of one
ſimple colouring; and conſequently the animal's own juices can give only
one colour; whereas we ſee ſome ſhells ſtained with an hundred.</p>
               <p>The uſual way of accounting for the different colouring of
ſhells, which ſeems to me erroneous, is this. In the body of every one of
theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, ſeveral ſtreaks are diſcerned of a different 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0824000107:10"/> colour from the reſt. This variety, ſay they, is an
inconteſtible proof that the juices flowing from thoſe parts will be alſo
of a different hue; and will conſequently tinge that part of the ſhell
which their ſlime compoſes of a different colour. But this ſyſtem, as
was obſerved before, is overthrown by the fact, which diſcovers that only
the outer ſurface of the ſhell is tinged; whereas, by this, it would have
been coloured throughout: nay, by this ſyſtem, the internal parts of the
ſhell would be ſtained with the moſt vivid colouring, as being leaſt
expoſed to the external injuries of the element where it is placed. But the
truth is, the animal reſiding in the ſhell has none of theſe various
colours thus talked of: its ſlime is a ſimple pellucid ſubſtance; and
the only marblings which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in its body, are the colour of the food, which
is ſeen through its tranſparent inteſtines. We muſt, therefore, account
for the various colouring of its ſhell upon a different principle.</p>
               <p>If, as I ſaid, we examine the cabinets of the curious, we
ſhall find ſhells with various and beautiful colouring; we ſhall find
them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally furniſhed with a white ground, tinctured with red, yellow,
brown, green, and ſeveral other ſhades and lovely mixtures, but never blue.
Shells are of almoſt all colours but blue. <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0824000107:11"/> The reaſon
ſeems to be obvious; for blue is the colour which ſea-water changes. A
piece of ſilk, or a feather, of this colour, put into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of
ſalt, urine, or nitre, loſe their tint entirely. Now may not this give us a
hint with reſpect to the operation of Nature in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring her ſhells? May
we not from hence conclude, that ſea-water is efficacious in giving colour or
taking it away? That, to produce colour, the animal not only furniſhes its
juices, but the ſea or the earth that mixture of ſubſtance which is to
unite with them. Neither the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſlime alone, nor the external earthy or
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſubſtances alone, could produce colours; but both united, produce
an effect which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeparately was poſſeſſed of. Thus ſhells
aſſume every colour but blue; and that ſea-water, inſtead of producing,
would be apt to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>From hence, therefore, it appears, that the animal does not
alone tincture its own ſhell; but that external cauſes co-operate in
contributing to its beauty. It is probable that, from the nature of its food,
or from other circumſtances unknown to us, the external layers of its ſlime
may be of different conſiſtencies; ſo as, when joined with the particles
of earth or ſalt that are accidentally united with them from without, 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0824000107:12"/> they aſſume various and beautiful hues. But the
internal layers, which receive no foreign ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture, ſtill preſerve the
natural colour of the animal, and continue white without any vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p>Thus far we ſee that the animal is not wholly the agent in
giving beauty and colouring to its ſhell: but it ſeems otherwiſe with
reſpect to its convolutions, its prominences, and general form. Theſe
entirely depend upon the art of the animal; or rather upon its inſtincts;
which, in the ſame kinds, are ever invariable. The ſhell generally bears
ſome rude reſemblance to the body upon which it has been moulded. Thus it
is obſervable in all ſea-ſhells, that if the animal has any tumour or
excreſcence on its body, it creates likewiſe a ſwelling in that part of
the incruſtation to which it correſponds. When the animal begins to alter
its poſition, and to make new additions to its apartments, the ſame
protuberance which had raiſed the ſhell before in one part, ſwells it
again at ſome little diſtance; by which means we ſee the ſame
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, in a ſpiral line, all round the ſhell. Sometimes theſe
tumours of the animal are ſo large, or ſo pointed, that thoſe which
riſe over them in the incruſtation, appear like horns: after this the
animal diſengages itſelf from its <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0824000107:13"/> firſt cavities,
and then, by freſh evacuations, aſſumes a new ſet of horns; and ſo
encreaſes the number in proportion to its growth. If, on the other hand, the
body happens to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled, the ſhell that covers it will be chanelled
likewiſe; if there be any protuberances in the body, which wind in a ſpiral
line about it, the ſhell will likewiſe have its tumours and cavities
winding round to the end.</p>
               <p>In this manner, as the animals are of various forms, the
ſhells exhibit an equal variety. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the diverſity is ſo great, and
the figures and colours ſo very ſtriking, that ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with a
kind of harmleſs indolence, have made the arrangement of them the ſtudy and
the buſineſs of their lives. Thoſe who conſult their beauty alone, take
care to have them poliſhed, and to have an external cruſt, or perioſteum,
as Swammerdam calls it, ſcoured off from their, ſurfaces by ſpirit of
ſalt. But there are others that, with more learned affectation, keep them
exactly in the ſtate in which they have been found, with their precious
cruſt ſtill round them. The expence men have ſometimes been at in making
ſuch collections, is amazing; and ſome ſhells, ſuch as the Stairs
ſhell or the Admiral ſhell, are not more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious for their
ſcarceneſs, than pearls are for <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0824000107:14"/> their beauty. Indeed,
it is the ſcarcity, and not the beauty, of the object that determines the
value of all natural curioſities. Thoſe ſhells that offer but little
beautiful to the ignorant are often the moſt precious; and thoſe ſhells
which an unlearned ſpectator would ſtop to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with admiration, one
accuſtomed to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of cabinets, would paſs over with
diſdain. Theſe collections, however, have their uſe; not only by
exhibiting the vaſt variety of Nature's operations, but alſo by exciting
our curioſity to the conſideration of the animals that form them. A mind
that can find innocent entertainment in theſe humble contemplations is well
employed; and, as we ſay of children, is kept from doing miſchief. Although
there may be nobler occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations than that conſidering the convolutions of a
ſhell, yet there may be ſome who want the ambition to aſpire after ſuch
arduous purſuits; there may be ſome unfit for them; there may be ſome who
find their ambition fully gratified by the praiſe which the collectors of
ſhells beſtow upon each other. Indeed, for a day or two, there is no mind
that a cabinet of ſhells cannot furniſh with pleaſing employment. What
can be more gratifying, as Pliny ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Plin. IX.
33.</bibl>
                  </note>, than to view Nature in all her irregularities, 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0824000107:15"/> and ſporting in her variety of ſhells! Such a
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of colour do they exhibit; ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of figure; flat,
concave, long, lunated, drawn round in a circle, the orbit cut in two; ſome
are ſeen with a riſing on the back, ſome ſmooth, ſome wrinkled,
toothed, ſtreaked, the point variouſly intorted, the mouth pointing like a
dagger, folded back, bent inwards: all theſe variations, and many more,
furniſh at once novelty, elegance, and ſpeculation.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the figure of ſhells, Ariſtotle has
divided them into three kinds; and his method is, of all others, the moſt
conformable to nature. Theſe are, firſt, the Univalve, or Turbinated, which
conſiſt of one piece, like the box of a ſnail; ſecondly, the Bivalve,
conſiſting of two pieces, united by a hinge, like an oyſter; and thirdly,
the Multivalve, conſiſting of more than two pieces, as the acorn-ſhell,
which has not leſs than twelve pieces that go to its compoſition. All
theſe kinds are found in the ſea at different depths; and are valuable in
proportion to their ſcarceneſs or beauty.</p>
               <p>From the variety of the colours and figure of ſhells, we may
paſs to that of their place and ſituation. Some are found in the ſea;
ſome in freſh-water rivers; ſome alive upon land; and a ſtill greater
quantity dead in the bowels of the <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0824000107:16"/> earth; But wherever
ſhells are found, they are univerſally known to be compoſed of one and
the ſame ſubſtance. They are formed of an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal or calcarious earth,
that ferments with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and other acids, and that burns into lime, and will
not eaſily melt into glaſs. Such is the ſubſtance of which they are
compoſed; and of their ſpoils, many philoſophers think that a great part
of the ſurface of the earth is compoſed at preſent. It is ſuppoſed by
them, that chalks, marles, and all ſuch earths as fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with vinegar, are
nothing more than a compoſition of ſhells, decayed, and crumbled down to
one uniform maſs.</p>
               <p>Sea-ſhells are either found in the depths of the ocean, or
they are caſt empty and forſaken of their animals upon ſhore. Thoſe
which are fiſhed up from the deep, are called by the Latin name Pelagii;
thoſe that are caſt upon ſhore, are called Littorales. Many of the
pelagii are never ſeen upon ſhore; they continue in the depths where they
are bred; and we owe their capture only to accident. Theſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are
the moſt ſcarce ſhells; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the moſt valuable. The
littorales are more frequent; and ſuch as are of the ſame kind with the
pelagii are not ſo beautiful. As they are often empty and forſaken, and as 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0824000107:17"/> their animal is dead and perhaps putrid in the bottom of
the ſhell, they by this means loſe the whiteneſs and the brilliancy of
their colouring. They are not unfrequently alſo found eaten through, either
by worms, or by each other; and they are thus rendered leſs valuable: but
what decreaſes their price ſtill more is, when they are ſcaled and worn
by lying too long empty at the bottom, or expoſed upon the ſhore. Upon the
whole, however, ſea-ſhells exceed either land or foſſil ſhells in
beauty; they receive the higheſt poliſh, and exhibit the moſt brilliant
and various colouring.</p>
               <p>Freſh-water ſhells are neither ſo numerous, ſo various,
or ſo beautiful as thoſe belonging to the ſea. They want that ſolidity
which the others have: their clavicle, as it is called, is neither ſo
prominent nor ſo ſtrong; and not having a ſaline ſubſtance to tinge
the ſurface of the ſhell, the colours are obſcure. In freſh-water there
are but two kinds of ſhells; namely, the bivalved and the turbinated.</p>
               <p>Living land ſhells are more beautiful, though not ſo various
as thoſe of freſh-water; and ſome not inferior to ſea ſhells in
beauty. They are indeed but of one kind, namely, the turbinated; but in that
there are found four or five very beautiful varieties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0824000107:18"/>Of foſſil, or, as they are called,
<hi>extraneous</hi> ſhells, found in the bowels of the earth, there are great
numbers, and as great a variety. In this claſs there are as many kinds as in
the ſea itſelf. There are found the turbinated, the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valve, and the
multivalve kinds; and of all theſe, many at preſent not to be found even in
the ocean. Indeed, the number is ſo great, and the varieties ſo many, that
it was long the opinion of naturaliſts, that they were merely the capricious
productions of Nature, and had never given retreat to animals whoſe
habitations they reſembled. They were found, not only of various kinds, but
in different ſtates of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: ſome had the ſhell entire,
compoſed, as in its primitive ſtate, of a white calcarious earth, and
filled with earth, or even empty; others were found with the ſhell entire,
but filled with a ſubſtance which was petrified by time; others, and
theſe in great numbers, were found with the ſhell entirely mouldered away,
but the petrified ſubſtance that filled it ſtill exhibiting the figure of
the ſhell; others ſtill, that had been lodged near earth or ſtone,
impreſſed their print upon theſe ſubſtances, and left the
impreſſion, though they themſelves were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed: laſtly, ſome
ſhells were found half moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered away, their parts ſcaling off from each 
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0824000107:19"/> other in the ſame order in which they were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
formed. However, theſe different ſtages of the ſhell, and even their
fermenting with acids, were at firſt inſufficient to convince thoſe who
had before aſſigned them a different origin. They were ſtill conſidered
as accidentally and ſportively formed, and depoſited in the various
repoſitories where they were found, but no way appertaining to any part of
animated nature. This put ſucceeding enquirers upon more minute reſearches;
and they ſoon began to find, that often where they dug up petrified ſhells
or teeth, they could diſcover the petrified remains of ſome other bony
parts of the body. They found that the ſhells which were taken from the
earth, exhibited, the uſual defects and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances, which the ſame kind
are known to receive at ſea. They ſhewed them not only tinctured with a
ſalt water cruſt, but pierced in a peculiar manner by the ſea worms, that
make the ſhells of fiſhes their favourite food. Theſe demonſtrations
were ſufficient at laſt to convince all but a few philoſophers who died
away, and whoſe erroneous ſyſtems died with them.</p>
               <p>Every ſhell, therefore, wherever it is found, is now
conſidered as the ſpoil of ſome animal, that once found ſhelter
therein. It matters not by what unaccountable means they may 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0824000107:20"/> have wandered from the ſea; but they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit all, and
the moſt certain marks of their origin. From their numbers and ſituation,
we are led to conjecture, that the ſea reached the places where they are
found; and from their varieties we learn how little we know of all the ſea
contains at preſent; as the earth furniſhes many kinds which our moſt
exact and induſtrious ſhell-collectors have not been able to fiſh up from
the deep. It is moſt probable, that thouſands o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> different forms ſtill remain at the
bottom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; ſo that we may juſtly ſay with the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher: 
<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Ea quae ſcimus ſunt pars minima eorum
quae ignoramus.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is well, however, for mankind, that the defect of our
knowledge on this ſubject is, of all parts of learning, that which may be
moſt eaſily diſpenſed with. An encreaſe in the number of ſhells,
would throw but very few lights upon the hiſtory of the animals that inhabit
them. For ſuch information we are obliged to thoſe men who contemplated
ſomething more than the outſide of the objects before them. To Reaumur we
are obliged for examining the manners of ſome with accuracy; but to
Swam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merdam for more. In fact, this Dutchman has lent an attention to thoſe
animals, that almoſt exceeds credibility: he has excelled even the 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0824000107:21"/> inſects he diſſected, in patience, induſtry, and
perſeverance. It was in vain that this poor man's father diſſuaded him
from what the world conſidered as a barren purſuit; it was in vain that an
habitual diſorder, brought on by his application, interrupted his efforts; it
was in vain that mankind treated him with ridicule while living, as they
ſuffered his works to remain long unprinted and neglected when dead: ſtill
the Dutch philoſopher went on, peeping into unwholſome ditches, wading
through fens, diſſecting ſpiders, and enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the blood-veſſels
of a ſnail: like the bee, whoſe heart he could not only diſtinguiſh,
but diſſect, he ſeemed inſtinctively impelled by his ruling
paſſion, although he found nothing but ingratitude from man, and though his
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry was apparently becoming fatal to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. From him I will take
ſome of the leading features in the hiſtory of thoſe animals which breed
in ſhells; previouſly taking my diviſion from Ariſtotle, who, as was
ſaid above, divides them into three claſſes: the Turbinated, or thoſe
of the Snail Kind; the Bivalved, or thoſe of the Oyſter Kind; and the
Multivalved, or thoſe of the A corn-ſhell Kind. Of each I will treat in
diſtinct chapters.</p>

                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0824000107:23"/> TO conceive the manner in which thoſe
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals ſubſiſt that are hid from us at the bottom of the deep, we
muſt again have recourſe to one of a ſimilar nature and formation, that
we know. The hiſtory of the garden-ſnail has been more copiouſly
conſidered than that of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; and its anatomy is as well, if not
better known: however, not to give any one object more room in the general
picture of Nature than it is entitled to, it will be ſufficient to
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the ſnail is ſurprizingly fitted for the life it is formed
to lead. It is furniſhed with the organs of life in a manner almoſt as
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete as the largeſt animal; with a tongue, brain, ſalival ducts,
glands, nerves, ſtomach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines; liver, heart and
blood-veſſels: beſides this, it has a purple bag that furniſhes a red
matter to different parts of the body, together with ſtrong muſcles that
hold it to the ſhell, and which are hardened, like tendons, at their
inſertion.</p>
               <p>But theſe it poſſeſſes in common with other animals.
We muſt now ſee what it has peculiar <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0824000107:24"/> to itſelf. The
firſt ſtriking peculiarity is, that the animal has got its eyes on the
points of its largeſt horns. When the ſnail is in motion, four horns are
diſtinctly ſeen; but the two up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt and longeſt deſerve peculiar
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, both on account of the various mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with which they are
endued, as well as their having their eyes fixed at the extreme ends of them.
Theſe appear like two blackiſh points at their ends. When conſidered as
taken out of the body, they are of a bulbous or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nip-like figure; they have
but one coat; and the three humours which are common in the eyes of other
animals, namely, the vitreous, the aqueous and the chryſtalline, are in
theſe very indiſtinctly ſeen. The eyes the animal can direct to different
objects at pleaſure, by a regular motion out of the body; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it
hides them, by a very ſwift con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction into the belly. Under the ſmall
horns is the animal's mouth; and though it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear too ſoft a
ſubſtance to be furniſhed with teeth, yet it has not leſs than eight of
them, with which it devours leaves, and other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſeemingly
harder than itſelf; and with which it ſometimes bites off pieces of its own
ſhell.</p>
               <p>But what is moſt ſurprizing in the formation of this animal,
are the parts that ſerve for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0824000107:25"/> Every ſnail
is at once male and female; and while it impregnates another, is itſelf
impregnated in turn. The veſſels ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the fluid for this purpoſe,
are placed chiefly in the fore part of the neck, and extend themſelves over
the body; but the male and female organs of generation, are always found
united, and growing together. There is a large opening on the right ſide of
the neck, which ſerves for very different purpoſes. As an anus it gives a
paſſage to the excrements; as a mouth it ſerves for an opening for
reſpiration; and alſo as an organ of generation, it dilates when the
deſire of propagation begins. Within this each animal has thoſe parts, or
ſomething ſimilar thereto, which continue the kind.</p>
               <p>For ſome days before coition, the ſnails gather together,
and lie quiet near each other, eating very little in the mean time; but they
ſettle their bodies in ſuch a poſture, that the neck and head are placed
upright. In the mean time, the apertures on the ſide of the neck being
greatly dilated, two organs, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling inteſtines, are ſeen iſſuing
from them, which ſome have thought to be the inſtruments of generation.
Beſide the protruſion of theſe, each animal is poſſeſſed of
another peculiarity; for, from the ſame aperture, they launch forth 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0824000107:26"/> a kind of dart at each other, which is pretty hard,
barbed, and ending in a very ſharp point. This is performed when the
apertures approach each other; and then the one is ſeen to ſhoot its
weapon, which is received by the other, though it ſometimes falls to the
ground: ſome minutes after, the ſnail which received the weapon, darts one
of its own at its antagoniſt, which is received in like manner. They then
ſoftly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſtill nearer, and apply their bodies one to the other, as
cloſely as the palms and fingers of the hands, when graſped together. At
that time the horns are ſeen variouſly moving in all directions; and this
ſometimes for three days together. The coupling of theſe animals is
generally thrice repeated, at intervals of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days each; and, at every
time, a new dart is mutually emitted.</p>
               <p>At the expiration of eighteen days, the ſnails produce their
eggs, at the opening of the neck, and hide them in the earth with the
greateſt ſolicitude and induſtry. Theſe eggs are in great numbers,
round, white, and covered with a ſoft ſhell: they are alſo ſtuck to
each other by an imperceptible ſlime, like a bunch of grapes, of about the
ſize of a ſmall pea.</p>
               <p>When the animal leaves the egg, it is ſeen with a very ſmall
ſhell on its back, which has but one convolution; but in proportion as it 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0824000107:27"/> grows, the ſhell encreaſes in the number of its
circles. The ſhell always receives its additions at the mouth; the firſt
centre ſtill remaining: the animal ſending forth from its body that ſlime
which hardens into a ſtony ſubſtance, and ſtill is faſhioned into
ſimilar volutions. The garden ſnail ſeldom exceeds four rounds and an
half; but ſome of the ſea ſnails arrive even at ten.</p>
               <p>The ſnail, thus fitted with its box, which is light and firm,
finds itſelf defended in a very ample manner from all external injury.
When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is invaded, it is but retiring into this fortreſs, and waiting
patiently till the danger is over. Nor is it poſſeſſed only of a power
of retreating into its ſhell; but of mending it when broken. Sometimes
theſe animals are cruſhed ſeemingly to pieces; and, to all appearance,
utterly deſtroyed: yet ſtill they ſet themſelves to work, and, in a few
days, mend all their numerous breaches. The ſame ſubſtance by which the
ſhell is originally made, goes to the re-eſtabliſhment of the ruined
habitation. But all the junctures are very eaſily ſeen, for they have a
freſher colour than the reſt, and the whole ſhell in ſome meaſure
reſembles an old coat, patched with new pieces. They are ſometimes ſeen
with eight or ten of theſe patches; ſo that <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0824000107:28"/> the damage
muſt have been apparently irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Still, however, though the animal is
poſſeſſed of the power of mending its ſhell, it cannot, when come to
its full growth, make a new one. Swammerdam tried the experiment: he ſtripped
a ſnail of its ſhell, without hurting any of the blood-veſſels,
retaining that part of the ſhell where the muſcles were inſerted; but it
died in three days after it was ſtripped of its covering: not, however,
without making efforts to build up a new ſhell; for, before its death, it
preſſed out a certain membrane round the whole ſurface of its body. This
membrane was entirely of the ſhelly nature; and was intended, by the animal,
as a ſupply towards a new one.</p>
               <p>As the ſnail is furniſhed with all the organs of life and
ſenſation, it is not wonderful to ſee it very voracious. It chiefly
ſubſiſts upon the leaves of plants and trees; but is very delicate in its
choice. When the animal moves to ſeek its food, it goes forward by means of
that broad muſcular ſkin which ſometimes is ſeen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting round the
mouth of the ſhell; this is expanded before, and then contracted with a kind
of undulating motion, like a man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to move himſelf forward by one
arm, while lying on his belly. But the ſnail has ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage, by which
it not only ſmooths and planes its way, but alſo can aſcend in the 
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0824000107:29"/> moſt perpendicular direction. This is by that ſlimy
ſubſtance with which it is ſo copiouſly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and which it
emits wherever it moves. Upon this ſlime, as upon a kind of carpet, it
proceeds ſlowly along, without any danger of wounding its tender body
againſt the aſperities of the pavement; by means of this it moves upwards
to its food upon trees; and by this deſcends, without danger of falling, and
breaking its ſhell by the ſhock.</p>
               <p>The appetite of theſe animals is very great; and the damage
gardeners in particular ſuſtain from them, makes them employ every method
for their deſtruction. Salt will deſtroy them, as well as ſoot; but a
tortoiſe in a garden, is ſaid to baniſh them much more effectually.</p>
               <p>At the approach of winter, the ſnail buries itſelf in the
earth; or retires to ſome hole, to continue in a torpid ſtate, during the
ſeverity of the ſeaſon. It is ſometimes ſeen alone; but more
frequently in company in its retreat; ſeveral being uſually found together,
appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently deprived of life and ſenſation. For the purpoſes of
continuing in greater warmth and ſecurity, the ſnail forms a cover or lid
to the mouth of its ſhell with its ſlime, which ſtops it up entirely, and
thus protects it from every external danger. The matter of <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0824000107:30"/>
which the cover is compoſed, is whitiſh, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like plaiſter,
pretty hard and ſolid, yet at the ſame time porous and thin, to admit air,
which the animal cannot live without. When the cover is formed too thick, the
ſnail then breaks a little hole in it, which corrects the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that
cloſeneſs, which proceeded from too much caution. In this manner,
ſheltered in its hole from the weather, defended in its ſhell by a cover,
it ſleeps during the winter; and, for ſix or ſeven months, continues
without food or motion, until the genial call of ſpring breaks its ſlumber,
and excites its activity.</p>
               <p>The ſnail, having ſlept for ſo long a ſeaſon, wakes
one of the firſt fine days of April; breaks open its cell, and ſallies
forth to ſeek for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. It is not ſurprizing that ſo long a
faſt ſhould have thinned it, and rendered it very voracious. At firſt,
therefore, it is not very difficult in the choice of its food; almoſt any
vegetable that is green, ſeems welcome; but the ſucculent plants of the
garden are chiefly grateful; and the various kind of pulſe are, at ſome
ſeaſons, almoſt wholly deſtroyed by their numbers. So great is the
multiplication of ſnails at ſome years, that gardeners imagine they burſt
from the earth. A wet ſeaſon is generally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to their production;
for this animal <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0824000107:31"/> cannot bear very dry ſeaſons, or dry
places, as they cauſe too great a conſumption of its ſlime, without
plenty of which it cannot ſubſiſt in health and vigour.</p>
               <p>Such are the moſt ſtriking particulars in the hiſtory of
this animal; and this may ſerve as a general picture, to which the manners
and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes of the other tribes of this claſs may be compared and
referred. Theſe are, the ſea ſnail, of which naturaliſts have, from the
apparent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their ſhells, mentioned fifteen kinds<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>D'Argenville's Conchyoligie.</bibl>
                  </note>; the
freſh-water ſnail, of which there are eight kinds; and the land-ſnail, of
which there are five. Theſe all bear a ſtrong reſemblance to the garden
ſnail, in the formation of their ſhell, in their hermaphrodite natures, in
the ſlimy ſubſtance with which they are covered, in the formation of
their inteſtines, and the diſpoſition of the hole on the right ſide of
the neck, which ſerves at once for the diſcharge of the faeces, for the
lodging the inſtruments of generation, and for reſpiration, when the animal
is under a neceſſity of taking in a new ſupply.</p>
               <p>But in Nature, no two kinds of animals, however like each other
in figure or conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, are of manners entirely the ſame. Though the
common garden ſnail bears a very ſtrong <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0824000107:32"/> reſemblance
to that of freſh-water, and that of the ſea, yet there are differences to
be found, and thoſe very conſiderable ones.</p>
               <p>If we compare them with the freſh-water ſnail, though we
ſhall find a general reſemblance, yet there are one or two remarkable
diſtinctions: and firſt, the freſh-water ſnail, and, as I ſhould
ſuppoſe, all ſnails that live in water, are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly furniſhed with
a contrivance by Nature, for riſing to the ſurface, or ſinking to the
bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. The manner in which this is performed, is by opening and ſhutting
the orifice on the right ſide of the neck, which is furniſhed with
muſcles for that purpoſe. The ſnail ſometimes gathers this aperture
into an oblong tube, and ſtretches or portends it above the ſurface of the
water, in order to draw in or expel the air, as it finds occaſion. This may
not only be ſeen, but heard alſo by the noiſe which the ſnail makes in
moving the water. By dilating this it riſes; by compreſſing it, the
animal ſinks to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. This is effected ſomewhat in the manner in
which little images of glaſs are made to riſe or ſink in water, by
preſſing the air contained at the mouth of the tubes, ſo that it ſhall
drive the water into their hollow bodies, which before were filled only with
air, and thus make them heavier than the element in which they ſwim. 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0824000107:33"/> In this manner does the freſh-water ſnail dive or
ſwim, by properly managing the air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in its body.</p>
               <p>But what renders theſe animals far more worthy of notice is,
that they are viviparous, and bring forth their young not only alive, but with
their ſhells upon their backs. This ſeems ſurprizing; yet it is
inconteſtably true: the young come to ſome degree of perfection in the womb
of the parent; there they receive their ſtony coat; and from thence are
excluded, with a complete apparatus for ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"On the twelfth of March," ſays Swam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merdam,
"I began my obſervations upon this ſnail, and collected a great number of
the kind, which I put into a large baſon filled with rain-water, and fed for
a long time with pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's earth, diſſolved in the water about them. On the
thirteenth of the ſame month I opened one of theſe ſnails, when I found
nine living ſnails in its womb: the largeſt of theſe were placed
foremoſt, as the firſt candidates for excluſion. I put them into
freſh-water, and they lived to the eighteenth of the ſame month, moving and
ſwimming, like ſnails full grown: nay their manner of ſwimming was much
more beautiful."</q> Thus, at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever time of the year theſe ſnails are
opened, <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0824000107:34"/> they are ſound pregnant with eggs, or with
living ſnails; or with both together.</p>
               <p>This ſtriking difference between the freſh-water and the
garden ſnail, obtains alſo in ſome of the ſea kind; among which there
are ſome that are found viviparous, while others lay eggs in the uſual
manner. Of this kind are one or two of the Buccinums; within which living young
have been frequently found, upon their diſſection. In general, however, the
reſt of this numerous claſs bring forth eggs; from whence the animal
burſts at a proper ſtate of maturity, completely equipped with an houſe,
which the moiſtneſs of the element where it reſides does not prevent the
inhabitant from enlarging. How the ſoft ſlime of the ſnail hardens, at
the bottom of the ſea, into the ſtony ſubſtance of a ſhell, is not
eaſy to conceive! This ſlime muſt at leaſt be poſſeſſed of very
powerful petrifying powers.</p>
               <p>All animals of the ſnail kind, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, are
hermaphrodites; each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the inſtruments of generation double. But
ſome of the ſea kinds copulate in a different manner from thoſe of the
garden. The one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnates the other; but, from the poſition of the parts,
is incapable of being impregnated by the ſame in turn. For this reaſon it
is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0824000107:35"/> for a third to be admitted as a partner
in this operation: ſo that, while one impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates that before it, another
does the ſame office by this; which is itſelf impregnated by a fourth. In
this manner, Mr. Adanſon has ſeen vaſt numbers of ſea ſnails, united
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a chain, impregnating each other. The <hi>bulin</hi> and the
<hi>coret</hi> perform the offices of male and female at the ſame time. The
orifices in theſe are two, both ſeparate from each other: the opening by
which the animal performs the office of the male, being at the origin of the
horns; that by which it is paſſive, as the female, being farther down upon
the neck. It may alſo be obſerved as a general rule, that all animals that
have this orifice, or verge, as ſome call it, on the right ſide, have their
ſhells turned from the right to the left; on the contrary, thoſe which have
it on the left ſide, have their ſhells turned from left to right, in a
contrary direction to the former.</p>
               <p>But this is not the only difference between land and ſea
ſnails. Many of the latter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely want horns; and none of them have above
two. Indeed, if the horns of ſnails be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with eyes, and if, as
ſome are willing to think, the length of the horn, like the tube of a
teleſcope, aſſiſts viſion, theſe animals, that <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0824000107:36"/>
chiefly reſide in the gloomy bottom of the deep, can have no great occaſion
for them. Eyes would be unneceſſary to creatures whoſe food is uſually
concealed in the darkeſt places; and who, poſſeſſed of very little
motion, are obliged to grope for what they ſubſiſt on. To ſuch, I
ſay, eyes would rather be an obſtruction than an advantage; and perhaps
even thoſe that live upon land are without them!</p>
               <p>Thoſe that have ſeen the ſhells of ſea ſnails, need
not be told that the animal which produces them is larger than thoſe of the
ſame denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon land. The ſea ſeems to have the property of
enlarging the magnitude of all its inhabitants; and the ſame proportion that
a trout bears to a ſhark, is often ſeen to obtain between a ſhell bred
upon the land, and one bred in the ocean. Its convolutions are more numerous.
The garden ſnail has but five turns at the moſt; in the ſea ſnail the
convolutions are ſometimes ſeen amounting to ten.</p>
               <p>There is a difference alſo in the poſition of the mouth, in
the garden and the water ſnail. In the former, the mouth is placed
croſswiſe, as in quadrupedes; furniſhed with jaw-bones, lips and teeth.
In moſt of the ſea ſnails, the mouth is placed longitudinally in the
head; <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0824000107:37"/> and, in ſome, obliquely, or on one ſide. Others,
of the Trochus kind, have no mouth whatſoever; but are furniſhed with a
trunk, very long in ſome kinds, and ſhorter in others.</p>
               <p>Snails of the Trochus kind, furniſhed thus with an
inſtrument of offence, deſerve our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention. The trunk of the
Trochus is fleſhy, muſcular, ſupple, and hollow. Its extremity is
bordered with a cartilage, and toothed like a ſaw. The ſnails that are
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with this, may be conſidered as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious tribe, among their
fellows of the bottom. They are, among ſnails, what the tiger, the eagle or
the ſhark is among beaſts, birds or fiſhes. The whole race of ſhelled
animals avoid their approach; for their habitations, however powerfully and
ſtrongly built, though never ſo well fortified, yield to the ſuperior
force of theſe invaders. Though provided with a thick clumſy ſhell
themſelves, yet they move with greater ſwiftneſs at the bottom than
moſt other ſhell fiſh; and ſeize their prey with greater facility. No
ſhell ſo large but they will boldly venture to attack; and, with their
piercing augre-like trunk, will quickly bore it through. No efforts the other
animal makes can avail: it expands itſelf, and riſes to the ſurface; but
the enemy riſes with it: it again ſinks to the <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0824000107:38"/> bottom,
but ſtill its deſtroyer cloſely adheres. In this manner the carnivorous
ſhell-fiſh, as ſome naturaliſts call it, ſticks for ſeveral days,
nay weeks, to its prey, until, with its trunk, it has ſucked out all
ſubſtance, or until it drops off when the other begins to putrefy.</p>
               <p>Thus it would ſeem throughout nature, that no animal is ſo
well defended, but that others are found capable of breaking in upon its
entrenchments. The garden ſnail ſeems tolerably well guarded; but the wall
of its ſhell is paper itſelf, in compariſon with that which fortifies
ſome of the ſea ſnail kind. Beſide this thick ſhell, many of them are
alſo furniſhed with a lid, which covers the mouth of the ſhell, and which
opens and ſhuts at the animal's pleaſure. When the creature hunts for food,
it opens its box, gropes or ſwims about; and, when ſatisfied, drops its lid
and ſinks to the bottom: there it might be ſuppoſed to remain in perfect
ſecurity; but the trochus ſoon finds the way to break into the thickeſt
part of its encloſure, and quickly deſtroys it with the moſt fatal
induſtry.</p>
               <p>The being liable to the attacks of the trochus ſeems to be a
calamity to which moſt of this tribe are ſubject. Scarce a ſhell is met
with entire and ſound to the end of its convolutions; but particularly the
thinneſt ſhells are the moſt <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0824000107:39"/> ſubject to be thus
invaded. As their ſhells are eaſily pierced, the predatory ſhell-fiſh,
or the ſea-worm, chiefly ſeek them for ſubſiſtence; and of thoſe
thin paper-like ſhells, not one in an hundred is found that has not
ſuffered ſome diſaſter. As they are lighter than other ſhell-fiſh,
they ſwim with greater eaſe; and this is the chief method of avoiding their
heavier thick ſhelled purſuers. The food of all ſnails properly lies at
the bottom; when, therefore, the nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilus, or other thin ſhelled fiſh, are
ſeen buſily ſwimming at the ſurface, it may be, that, inſtead of
ſporting or ſunning themſelves, as ſome are apt to ſuppoſe, they
are actually labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſcape their moſt deadly purſuers.</p>
               <p>Of all ſea ſnails, that which is moſt frequently ſeen
ſwimming upon the ſurface, and whoſe ſhell is the thinneſt and moſt
eaſily pierced, is the Nautilus. Whether, upon theſe occaſions, it is
employed in eſcaping its numerous enemies at the bottom, or ſeeking for
food at the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, I will not venture to decide. It ſeems moſt
probable, that the former is the cauſe of its frequently appearing; for, upon
opening the ſtomach, it is found to contain chiefly that food which it finds
at the bottom. This ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's induſtry, therefore, may be owing to its 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0824000107:40"/> fears; and all thoſe arts of ſailing, which it has
taught mankind, may have been originally the product of neceſſity. But the
nautilus is too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous not to demand a more ample deſcription.</p>
               <p>Although there be ſeveral ſpecies of the nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilus, yet they
all may be divided into two: the one with a white ſhell, as thin as paper,
which it often is ſeen to quit, and again to reſume; the other with a
thicker ſhell, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a beautiful mother-of-pearl colour, and that
quits its ſhell but rarely. This ſhell out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reſembles that of a
large ſnail, but is generally ſix or eight inches acroſs: within, it is
divided into forty partitions, that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with each other by doors, if I
may ſo call them, through which one could not thruſt a gooſe-quill:
almoſt the whole internal part of the ſhell is filled by the animal; the
body of which, like its habitation, is divided into as many parts as there are
chambers in its ſhell: all the parts of its body communicate with each other,
through the doors or openings, by a long blood-veſſel, which runs from the
head to the tail: thus the body of the animal, if taken out of the ſhell, may
be likened to a number of ſoft bits of fleſh, of which there are forty,
threaded upon a ſtring. From this extraordinary conformation, one would not
be apt to ſuppoſe <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0824000107:41"/> that the nautilus ſometimes
quitted its ſhell, and returned to it again; yet nothing, though ſeemingly
more impoſſible, is more certain. The manner by which it contrives to
diſengage every part of its body from ſo intricate an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; by which
it makes a ſubſtance, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as thick as one's wriſt, paſs
through forty doors, each of which would ſcarcely admit a gooſe-quill, is
not yet diſcovered: but the fact is certain; for the animal is often found
without its ſhell; and the ſhell more frequently deſtitute of the animal.
It is moſt probable, that it has a power of making the ſubſtance of one
ſection of its body remove up into that which is next; and thus, by
multiplied removals, it gets free.</p>
               <p>But this, though very ſtrange, is not the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity for
which the nautilus has been the moſt diſtinguiſhed. Its ſpreading the
thin oar, and catching the flying gale, to uſe the poet's deſcription of
it, has chiefly excited human cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. Theſe animals, particularly
thoſe of the white, light kind, are chiefly found in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean; and
ſcarce any who have ſailed on that ſea, but muſt often have ſeen
them. When the ſea is calm, they are obſerved floating on the ſurface;
ſome ſpreading their little ſail; <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0824000107:42"/> ſome rowing with
their feet, as if for life and death; and others ſtill, floating upon their
mouths, like a ſhip with the keel upward. If taken while thus employed, and
examined, the extraordinary mechaniſm of their limbs for ſailing will
appear more manifeſt. The nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilus is furniſhed with eight feet, which
iſſue near the mouth, and may as properly be called barbs: theſe are
connected to each other by a thin ſkin, like that between the toes of a duck,
but much thinner and more tranſparent. Of theſe eight feet thus connected,
ſix are ſhort, and theſe are held up as ſails to catch the wind in
ſailing: the two others are longer, and are kept in the water; ſerving,
like paddles, to ſteer their courſe by. When the weather is quite calm, and
the animal is purſued from below, it is then ſeen expanding only a part of
its ſail, and rowing with the reſt: whenever it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or fears
danger from above, it inſtantly furls the ſail, catches in all its oars,
turns its ſhell mouth downward, and inſtantly ſinks to the bottom.
Sometimes alſo it is ſeen pumping the water from its leaking hulk; and,
when unfit for ſailing, deſerts its ſhell entirely. The forſaken hulk
is ſeen floating along, till it daſhes, by a kind of ſhipwreck, upon the
rocks or the ſhore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0824000107:43"/>From the above deſcription, I think we may
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this animal rather as attempting to ſave itſelf from the
attacks of its deſtroyers, than as rowing in purſuit of food. Certain it
is, that no creature of the deep has more numerous and more powerful enemies.
Its ſhell is ſcarcely ever found in perfect preſervation; but is
generally ſeen to bear ſome marks of hoſtile invaſion. Its little arts,
therefore, upon the ſurface of the water, may have been given it for
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and it may be thus endued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative ſwiftneſs, to
avoid the crab, the ſea-ſcorpion, the trochus, and all the ſlower
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious reptiles that lurk for it at the bottom of the water.</p>
               <p>From this general view of ſnails, they appear to be a much
more active, animated tribe, than from their figure one would at firſt
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. They ſeem, to an inattentive ſpectator, as mere inert maſſes
of ſoft fleſh, rather loaded than covered with a ſhell, ſcarcely
capable of motion, and inſenſible to all the objects around them. When
viewed more cloſely, they are found to be furniſhed with the organs of life
and ſenſation in tolerable perfection: they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with armour, that
is at once both light and ſtrong; they are as active as their neceſſities
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0824000107:44"/> require; and are poſſeſſed of appetites more
poignant than thoſe of animals that ſeem much more perfectly formed. In
ſhort, they are a fruitful induſtrious tribe; furniſhed, like all other
animals, with the powers of eſcape and invaſion; they have their purſuits
and their enmities; and, of all creatures of the deep, they have moſt to fear
from each other.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of Bivalved Shell-Fiſh, or Shells of the
Oyſter Kind.</head>
               <p>IT may ſeem whimſical to make a diſtinction between the
animal perfections of turbinated and bivalved ſhell-fiſh, or to grant a
degree of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority to the ſnail above the oyſter. Yet this
diſtinction ſtrongly and apparently obtains in nature; and we ſhall find
the bivalved tribe of animals in every reſpect inferior to thoſe we have
been deſcribing. Inferior in all their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; inferior in their
powers of motion; but particularly inferior in their ſyſtem of animal
generation. The ſnail tribe, as we ſaw, are hermaphrodite, but require the
aſſiſtance of each other for fecundation; all the bivalve tribe are
hermaphrodite in like manner, but they require no aſſiſtance from each
other towards impregnation; and a ſingle muſcle or oyſter, if there were
no other in the world, would quickly repleniſh the ocean. As the land ſnail
from its being beſt known took the lead in the former claſs, ſo the
freſh-water muſcle, for the ſame reaſon, may take lead in this. The
life and manners of ſuch as belong to the ſea will be beſt diſplayed in
the compariſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0824000107:46"/>The muſcle, as is well known, whether
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to freſh or ſalt-water, conſiſts of two equal ſhells,
joined at the back by a ſtrong muſcular ligament that anſwers all the
purpoſes of an hinge. By the elaſtic contraction of theſe, the animal can
open its ſhells at pleaſure, about a quarter of an inch from each other.
The fiſh is fixed to either ſhell by four tendons, by means of which it
ſhuts them cloſe, and keeps its body firm from being cruſhed by any
ſhock againſt the walls of its own habitation. It is furniſhed, like all
other animals of this kind, with vital organs, though theſe are ſituated in
a very extraordinary manner. It has a mouth furniſhed with two fleſhy lips;
its inteſtine begins at the bottom of the mouth, paſſes through the
brain, and makes a number of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolutions through the liver; on leaving
this organ, it goes on ſtraight into the heart, which it penetrates, and ends
in the anus; near which the lungs are placed, and through which it breathes,
like thoſe of the ſnail kind; and in this manner its languid circulation is
carried on<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>M. Mery. Anat. de Moule's
d'Etang.</bibl>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>But the organs of generation are what moſt deſerve to excite
our curioſity. Theſe conſiſt in each muſcle of two ovaries, which are
the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male part of its furniture, and of two ſeminal <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0824000107:47"/>
veſſels reſembling what are found in the male. Each ovary and each
ſeminal veſſel has its own proper canal; by the ovary canal the eggs
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the anus; and there alſo the ſeminal canals ſend their
fluids to impregnate them. By this contrivance, one ſingle animal ſuffices
for the double purpoſes of generation; and the eggs are excluded and
impregnated by itſelf alone.</p>
               <p>As the muſcle is thus furniſhed with a kind of
ſelf-creating power, there are few places where it breeds that it is not
found in great abundance. The ovaries uſually empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their
eggs in ſpring, and they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed in autumn. For this reaſon they
are found empty in ſummer and full in winter. They produce in great numbers,
as all bivalved ſhell-fiſh are found to do. The fecundity of the ſnail
kind is trifling in compariſon to the fertility of theſe. Indeed it may be
aſſerted as a general rule in nature, that the more helpleſs and
contemptible the animal, the more prolific it is always found. Thus all
creatures that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of reſiſting their deſtroyers, have nothing
but their quick multiplication, for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of their exiſtence.</p>
               <p>The multitude of theſe animals in ſome places is very great;
but, from their defencelefs ſtate, <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0824000107:48"/> the number of their
deſtroyers are in equal proportion. The crab, the cray-fiſh, and many other
animals, are ſeen to devour them; but the trochus is their moſt formidable
enemy. When their ſhells are found deſerted, if we then obſerve
cloſely, it is moſt probable we ſhall find that the trochus has been at
work in piercing them. There is ſcarce one of them without a hole in it; and
this probably was the avenue by which the enemy entered to deſtroy the
inhabitant.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the number of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's animated
enemies, it ſeems ſtill more fearful of the agitations of the element in
which it reſides; for if daſhed againſt rocks, or thrown far on the
beach, it is deſtroyed without a power of redreſs. In order to guard
againſt theſe, which are to this animal the commoneſt and the moſt
fatal accidents, although it has a power of ſlow motion, which I ſhall
preſently deſcribe, yet it endeavours to become ſtationary, and to attach
itſelf to any fixed object it happens to be near. For this purpoſe it is
furniſhed with a very ſingular capacity of binding itſelf by a number of
threads to whatever object it approaches; and theſe Reaumur ſuppoſed it
ſpun artificially, as ſpiders their webs which they faſten againſt a
wall. Of this however, latter <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0824000107:49"/> philoſophers have found
very great reaſon to doubt. It is therefore ſuppoſed that theſe
threads, which are uſually called the beard of the muſcle, are the natural
growth of the animal's body, and by no means produced at pleaſure. Indeed,
the extreme length of this beard in ſome, which far exceeds the length of the
body, ſeems impoſſible to be manufactured by the thruſting out and
drawing in of the tongue, with the glutinous matter of which the French
philoſopher ſuppoſed thoſe threads were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is even found to
encreaſe with the growth of the animal; and as the muſcle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes larger
and older, the beard becomes longer and its filaments more ſtrong<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Mercier du Paty, ſur le bouchots a moules. Tom. ii. de
l'Academie de la Rochelle.</bibl>
                  </note>. Be this as it will, nothing is more
certain than that the muſcle is found attached by theſe threads to every
fixed object; ſometimes, indeed, for want of ſuch an object, theſe
animals are found united to each other; and though thrown into a lake
ſeparately, they are taken out in bunches of many together.</p>
               <p>To have ſome fixed reſting place where the muſcle can
continue, and take in its accidental food, ſeems the ſtate that this animal
chiefly deſires. Its inſtrument of motion, by which <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0824000107:50"/> it
contrives to reach the object it wants to bind itſelf to, is that muſcular
ſubſtance reſembling a tongue, which is found long in proportion to the
ſize of the muſcle. In ſome it is two inches long, in others not a third
part of theſe dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This the animal has a power of thruſting out
of its ſhell; and with this it is capable of making a ſlight furrow in the
ſand at the bottom. By means of this furrow it can erect itſelf upon the
edge of its ſhell; and thus continuing to make the furrow in proportion as it
goes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it reaches out its tongue, that anſwers the purpoſe of an
arm, and thus carries its ſhell edge-ways, as in a grove, until it reaches
the point intended. There where it determines to take up its reſidence it
fixes the ends of its beard, which are glutinous, to the rock or the object,
whatever it be; and thus, like a ſhip at anchor, braves all the agitations of
the water. Sometimes the animal is attached by a large number of threads;
ſometimes but by three or four, that ſeem ſcarce able to retain it. When
the muſcle is fixed in this manner, it lives upon the little earthy particles
that the water tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to its ſhells, and perhaps the fleſh of the
moſt diminutive animals. However, it does not fail to grow conſiderably;
and ſome of this kind have been found a foot long. I have ſeen 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0824000107:51"/> the beards a foot and an half; and of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
the natives of Palermo ſometimes make gloves and ſtockings.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſhell-fiſh are found in lakes, rivers, and in the
ſea. Thoſe of the lake often grow to a very large ſize; but they ſeem a
ſolitary animal, and are found generally ſeparate from each other. Thoſe
of rivers are not ſo large, but yet in greater abundance; but the ſea
muſcle of all others is perhaps the moſt plenty. Theſe are often bred
artificially in ſalt-water marſhes that are overflowed by the tide; the
fiſhermen throwing them in at the proper ſeaſons; and there being
undiſturbed by the agitations of the ſea, and not preyed upon by their
powerful enemies at the bottom, they caſt their eggs, which ſoon become
perfect animals, and theſe are generally found in cluſters of ſeveral
dozen together. It requires a year for the peopling a muſcle-bed; ſo that,
if the number conſiſts of forty thouſand, a tenth part may annually be
left for the peopling the bed anew. Muſcles are taken from their beds from
the month of July to October; and they are ſold at a very moderate price.</p>
               <p>From this animal the oyſter differs very little, except in the
thickneſs of its ſhell, and its greater imbecility. The oyſter, like the
muſcle, <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0824000107:52"/> is formed with organs of life and reſpiration,
with inteſtines which are very voluminous, a liver, lungs, and heart. Like
the muſcle, it is ſelf-impregnated; and the ſhell, which the animal
ſoon acquires, ſerves it for its future habitation. Like the muſcle, it
opens its ſhell to receive the influx of water; and like that animal is
ſtrongly attached to its ſhells both above and below.</p>
               <p>But it differs in many particulars. In the firſt place its
ſhells are not equal, the one being cupped, the other flat; upon the cupped
ſhell it is always ſeen to reſt; for if it lay upon the flat ſide it
would then loſe all its water. It differs alſo in the thickneſs of its
ſhells, which are ſo ſtrongly lined and defended, that no animal will
attempt to pierce them. But though the oyſter be ſecured from the attacks
of the ſmall reptiles at the bottom, yet it often ſerves as an object to
which they are attached. Pipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms and other little animals fix their
habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the oyſter's ſides, and in this manner continue to live in
ſecurity. Among the number of theſe is a little red worm, that is often
found upon the ſhell; which ſome, from never ſeeing oyſters copulate,
erroneouſly ſuppoſed to be the male by which their ſpawn was
impregnated.</p>
               <p>The oyſter differs alſo from the muſcle in 
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0824000107:53"/> being utterly unable to change its ſituation. The
muſcle, as we have obſerved, is capable of erecting itſelf on an edge,
and going forward with a ſlow laborious motion. The oyſter is wholly
paſſive, and endeavours by all its powers to reſt fixed to one ſpot at
the bottom. It is entirely without that tongue which we ſaw an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the
purpoſes of an arm in the other animal; but nevertheleſs is often attached
very firmly to any object it happens to approach. Rocks, ſtones, pieces of
timber, or ſea-weeds, all ſeem proper to give it a fixture, and to
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it againſt the agitation of the waves. Nothing ſo common in the
rivers of the tropical climates as to ſee oyſters growing even amidſt the
branches of the foreſt. Many trees which grow along the banks of the ſtream
often bend their branches into the water, and particularly the mangrove, which
chiefly delights in a moiſt ſituation. To theſe the oyſters hang in
cluſters, like apples upon the moſt fertile tree; and in proportion as the
weight of the fiſh ſinks the plant into the water, where it ſtill
continues growing, the number of oyſters encreaſe, and hang upon the
branches. Thus there is nothing that theſe ſhell fiſh will not ſtick
to; they are often even found to ſtick to each other. This is effected by
means of a glue proper to <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0824000107:54"/> themſelves, which, when it
cements, the join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is as hard as the ſhell, and is as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly broken.
The joining ſubſtance, however, is not always of glue; but the animal grows
to the rocks, ſomewhat like the muſcle, by threads; although theſe are
only ſeen to take root in the ſhell, and not, as in the muſcle, to
ſpring from the body of the fiſh itſelf.</p>
               <p>Oyſters uſually caſt their ſpawn in May, which at
firſt appear like drops of candle-greaſe, and ſtick to any hard
ſubſtance they fall upon. Theſe are covered with a ſhell in two or
three days; and in three years the animal is large enough to be brought to
market. As they invariably remain in the places where they are laid, and as
they grow without any other ſeeming food than the afflux of ſea-water, it
is the cuſtom at Colcheſter, and other parts of the kingdom, where the tide
ſettles in marſhes on land, to pick up great quantities of ſmall
oyſters along the ſhore, which when firſt gathered ſeldom exceed the
ſize of a ſixpence. Theſe are depoſited in beds where the tide comes
in, and in two or three years grow to a tolerable ſize. They are ſaid to be
better taſted for being thus ſheltered from the agitations of the deep; and
a mixture of freſh-water en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into theſe repoſitories, is ſaid to
improve <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0824000107:55"/> their flavour, and to encreaſe their growth and
fatneſs.</p>
               <p>The oyſters, however, which are prepared in this manner, are
by no means ſo large as thoſe found ſticking to rocks at the bottom of
the ſea, uſually called rock-oyſters. Theſe are ſometimes found as
broad as a plate, and are admired by ſome as excellent food. But what is the
ſize of theſe compared to the oyſters of the Eaſt-Indies, ſome of
whoſe ſhells I have ſeen two feet over! The oyſters found along the
coaſt of Coromandel are capable of furniſhing a plentiful meal to eight or
ten men; but it ſeems univerſally agreed that they are no way comparable to
ours for delicacy or flavour.</p>
               <p>Thus the muſcle and the oyſter appear to have but few
diſtinctions except in their ſhape and the power of motion in the former.
Other bivalved ſhell-fiſh, ſuch as the cockle, the ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, and the
razor ſhell, have differences equally minute. The power of changing place,
which ſome of them effect in a manner quite peculiar to themſelves, makes
their greateſt difference. The ſcallop is particularly remarkable for its
method of moving forward upon land, or ſwimming upon the ſurface of the
water. When this animal finds itſelf deſerted by the tide, it makes very
remarkable efforts to regain the <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0824000107:56"/> water, moving towards the
ſea in a moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner. It firſt gapes with its ſhell as
widely as it can, the edges being often an inch aſunder; then it ſhuts them
with a jerk, and by this the whole animal riſes five or ſix inches from the
ground. It thus tumbles any how forward, and then renews the operation until it
has attained its journey's end. When in the water it is capable of ſupporting
itſelf upon the ſurface; and there opening and ſhutting its ſhells, it
tumbles over and over, and makes its way with ſome celerity.</p>
               <p>The Pivot or razor ſhell has a very different kind of motion.
As the former moves labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and ſlowly forward, ſo the razor ſhell
has only a power of ſinking point downward. The ſhells of this animal
reſemble nothing ſo much as the haft of a razor; and by this form it is
better enabled to dive into the ſoft ſand at the bottom. All the motions of
this little animal are confined to ſinking or riſing a foot downwards or
upwards in the ſand, for it never leaves the ſpot where firſt it was
planted. From time to time it is ſeen to riſe about half way out of its
hole; but if any way diſturbed, it ſinks perpendicularly down again. Juſt
over the place where the razor buries itſelf, there is a ſmall hole like a
chimney, through which the animal breathes, <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0824000107:57"/> or imbibes the
ſea-water. Upon the deſertion of the tide, theſe holes are eaſily
diſtinguiſhed by the fiſhermen who ſeek for it; and their method of
enticing the razor up from the depth of its retreat is by ſprinkling a little
ſea-ſalt upon the hole. This melting, no ſooner reaches the razor below
than it riſes inſtantly ſtraight upwards, and ſhews about half its
length above the ſurface. This appearance however is inſtantaneous; and if
the fiſher does not ſeize the opportunity, the razor buries itſelf with
great eaſe to its former depth. There it continues ſecure; no ſalt can
allure it a ſecond time; but it remains unmoleſted, unleſs the fiſher
will be at the trouble of digging it out ſometimes two feet below the
ſurface.</p>
               <p>Such are the minute differences between bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valved
ſhell-fiſh; but in the great out-lines of their nature they exactly
reſemble each other. It is particularly in this claſs of ſhell-fiſh
that pearls are found in greateſt abundance; and it is in the internal parts
of thoſe ſhells that are of a ſhining ſilvery colour that theſe gems
are uſually generated; but the pearl is alſo found to breed as well in the
muſcle or the ſcallop as in the oyſter. In fact it is found in all
bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valved ſhells, the inſides of which reſemble that well known
ſubſtance called mother of pearl.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0824000107:58"/>Whether pearls be a diſeaſe or an
accident in the animal is ſcarce worth enquiry. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion is, that
they are a kind of calculous concretion in the body of the animal, ſomewhat
reſembling a ſtone in the bladder, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to be
conſidered as a diſorder. It is ſaid, in confirmation of this opinion,
that thoſe coaſts upon which pearls are fiſhed are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy; and
therefore moſt probably oyſters ſhare the general influence of the
climate; it is alſo added that thoſe oyſters in which pearls are found
are always ill-taſted, which is a ſign of their being unfound; and
laſtly, it is aſſerted that the pearl grows ſometimes ſo big as to
keep the ſhells of the animal from ſhutting, and that thus it dies by being
expoſed. It is eaſy to ſee the weakneſs of theſe aſſertions,
which ſeem neither true nor amuſing. To anſwer them in their own way, if
a ſtone in the bladder be a diſorder, a ſtone in the ſtomach of an
oſtrich is a benefit, and ſo it may be in the ſhell of an oyſter. If
the ſhores where the pearls are fiſhed be unwholeſome to man, that,
inſtead of being diſadvantageous, is ſo much the more lucky for the
oyſter. If the pearl oyſters are the worſt taſted, ſo are kites and
ravens among birds; and yet we know that they are healthy and long-lived
animals: if the oyſter had ever <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0824000107:59"/> its ſhell kept
aſunder by the pearl within it, that would be a diſeaſe indeed: but this
in reality never happens; for the oyſter that breeds a large pearl always
breeds a large ſhell, and the ſhell itſelf indents to receive its
impreſſion. The pearl upon the whole ſeems bred from no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in
the animal, but accidentally produced by the ſame matter that goes to form
the ſhell. This ſubſtance, which is ſoft at firſt, quickly hardens;
and thus, by ſucceſſive coats, layer over layer, the pearl acquires its
dimenſions. If cut through, it will be found to conſiſt of ſeveral
coats, like an onion; and ſometimes a ſmall ſpeck is ſeen in the
middle, upon which the coats were originally formed.</p>
               <p>All oyſters, and moſt ſhell-fiſh, are found to contain
pearls; but that which particularly obtains the name of the pearl oyſter, has
a large ſtrong whitiſh ſhell, wrinkled and rough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and within
ſmooth and of a ſilver colour. From theſe the mother-of-pearl is taken,
which is nothing more than the internal coats of the ſhell, reſembling the
pearl in colour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. This is taken out and ſhaped into that
variety of utenſils which are found ſo beautiful; but the pearl itſelf is
chiefly prized; being found but in few oyſters, and generally adhering,
ſometimes making a print in the body <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0824000107:60"/> of the ſhell,
ſometimes at large within the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the fiſh.</p>
               <p>There are a great number of pearl fiſheries in America and
Aſia; but as pearls bear a worſe price than formerly, thoſe of America
are in a great meaſure diſcontinued. The moſt famous of all the Aſiatic
fiſheries is in the Perſian Gulph, near the Iſle of Bahren. There is
another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the coaſt of Madura and the Iſland of Ceylon; and there
was a third on the coaſts of Japan: but as theſe noble iſlanders have a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for jewels, and an abhorrence for ſuch Europeans as come in
purſuit of them, that fiſhery which is thought to be the moſt valuable of
all others is diſcontinued. The diving bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is now carried on only
in thoſe countries where the wretchedneſs of one part of mankind goes to
ſupport the magnificence of the other.</p>
               <p>The chief fiſhery, as was ſaid, is carried on in the
Perſian Gulph, and the moſt valuable pearls are brought from thence. The
value of theſe jewels encreaſes not only in proportion to their ſize, but
alſo their figure and colour; for ſome pearls are white, others are
yellowiſh, others of a lead colour; and ſome affirm they have been found as
black as jet. What it is that gives theſe different tinctures to pearls is
not known; Taverner aſcribes it to their lying <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0824000107:61"/> two or
three weeks upon ſhore after the oyſter is taken; Reaumur thinks it
proceeds from the colour of that part of the fiſh's body upon which the pearl
lies It is moſt probable that this colour proceeds, like the ſpots
frequently found on the internal ſurface of the ſhell itſelf, from ſome
accident while the pearl is growing.</p>
               <p>The beſt coloured pearls and the roundeſt are brought from
the Eaſt; thoſe of America are neither ſo white nor ſo exactly oval.
All pearls however in time become yellow; they may be conſidered as an animal
ſubſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a ſtony hardneſs, and like ivory taking a
tincture from the air. They have been even found to decay when kept in damp or
vaulted places, and to moulder into a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſcarce harder than
chalk. When the daughters of Stilicon, that were both betrothed, one after the
other, to the emperor Honorius, were buried, much of their finery was alſo
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited with them in the ſame tomb. In this manner they remained buried
for above eleven hundred years, till the foundations of the church of St. Peter
were laying. Their tomb was then diſcovered, and all their finery was found
in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable preſervation except their pearls, which were converted by time
and damps into a chalky powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0824000107:62"/>The wretched people that are deſtined to
fiſh for pearls, are either Negroes of ſome of the pooreſt of the natives
of Perſia. The inhabitants of this country are divided into tyrants and
ſlaves. The divers are not only ſubject to the dangers of the deep, to
tempeſts, to ſuffocation at the bottom, to being devoured by ſharks, but
from their profeſſion univerſally labour under a ſpitting of blood,
occaſioned by the preſſure of air upon their lungs in going down to the
bottom. The moſt robuſt and healthy young men are choſen for this
employment, but they ſeldom ſurvive it above five or ſix years. Their
fibres become rigid; their eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls turn red; and they uſually die
conſumptive.</p>
               <p>It is amazing how very long they are ſeen to continue at the
bottom. Some, as we are aſſured, have been known to continue three quarters
of an hour under water without breathing; and to one unuſed to diving, ten
minutes would ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſtrongeſt. Whether from ſome effort the
blood burſts the old paſſage which it had in the foetus, and circulates
without going through the lungs, it is not eaſy to tell; but certain it is
that ſome bodies have been diſſected with this canal of communication
open, and theſe extraordinary divers may be internally formed in that
manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0824000107:63"/>Be this as it may, no way of life ſeems
ſo laborious, ſo dangerous, or ſo painful. They fiſh for pearls, or
rather the oyſters that contain them, in boats twenty-eight feet long; and of
theſe there are ſometimes three or four hundred at a time, with each
ſeven or eight ſtones, which ſerve for anchors. There are from five to
eight divers belonging to each, that dive one after another. They are quite
naked, except that they have a net hanging down from the neck to put their
oyſters in, and gloves on their hands to defend them while they pick the
oyſters from the holes in the rocks; for in this manner alone can they be
gathered. Every diver is ſunk by means of a ſtone, weighing fifty pounds,
tied to the rope by which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends. He places his foot in a kind of
ſtirrup, and laying hold of the rope with his left hand, with his right he
ſtops his noſe to keep in his breath, as upon going down he takes in a very
long inſpiration. They are no ſooner come to the bottom, but they give the
ſignal to thoſe who are in the boat to draw up the ſtone; which done,
they go to work, filling their net as faſt as they can; and then giving
another ſignal, the boats above pull up the net loaded with oyſters, and
ſhortly after the diver himſelf to take a new inſpiration. They dive 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0824000107:64"/> to the depth of fifteen fathoms, and ſeldom go deeper.
They generally go every morning by break of day to this fatiguing employment,
taking the land wind to waft them out to ſea, and returning with the
ſea-breeze at night. The owners of the boats uſually hire the divers, and
the reſt of the boats crew, as we do our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, at ſo much a day. All
the oyſters are brought on ſhore, where they are laid in a great heap till
the pearl fiſhery is over, which continues during the months of November and
December. When opportunity ſerves, they then examine every oyſter, and it
is accidental whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the capture turns out advantageous. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no human
being can wiſh well to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which thus chains ſuch a number of
fellow creatures to the bottom, to pluck up a glittering mouldering pebble.</p>

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0824000107:66"/>MULTIVALVE SHELL-FISH may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as animals ſhut up in round boxes. To view their habitations externally, one
would be little apt to conſider them as the retreats of living creatures; and
ſtill leſs, to ſuppoſe that ſome of them carry their boxes with a
tolerable ſhare of ſwiftneſs, ſo as to eſcape their purſuers. Of
theſe there are principally two kinds; ſuch as move, and ſuch as are
ſtationary: the firſt are uſually known in our cabinets by the name of
ſea-eggs; the others are as often admired, from the cavities which they
ſcoop out for their habitation in the hardeſt marble. The firſt are
called, by naturaliſts, Echini, or Urchins: the latter are called Pholades,
or File Fiſh. Of both there are ſeveral ſorts; but, by deſcribing
theſe two, we ſhall have a competent idea of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>To a ſlight view, the ſea urchin may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the
huſk of a cheſtnut; being like it round, and with a number of bony prickles
ſtanding out on every ſide. To exhibit this extraordinary animal in every
light—if we could conceive a turnip ſtuck full of pins on every 
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0824000107:67"/> ſide, and running upon theſe pins with ſome degree
of ſwiftneſs, we ſhould have ſome idea of this extraordinary creature.
The mouth is placed downwards; the vent is above; the ſhell is a hollow
vaſe, reſembling a ſcooped apple; and this filled with a ſoft,
muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſubſtance, through which the inteſtines wind from the bottom
to the top. The mouth, which is placed undermoſt, is large and red,
furniſhed with five ſharp teet, which are eaſily diſcerned. The jaws
are ſtrengthened by five ſmall bones, in the centre of which is a ſmall
fleſhy tongue; and from this the inteſtines make a winding of five
ſpires, round the internal ſides of the ſhell, ending at top, where the
excrements are excluded. But what makes the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary part of this
animal's conformation, are its horns and its ſpines, that point from every
part of the body, like the horns of a ſnail, and that ſerve at once as legs
to move upon, as arms to feel with, and as inſtruments of capture and
defence. Between theſe horns it has alſo ſpines that are not endued with
ſuch a ſhare of motion. The ſpines and the horns iſſue from every
part of its body; the ſpines being hard and prickly; the horns being ſoft,
longer than the ſpines, and never ſeen except in the water. They are put
forward and withdrawn like the <pb facs="tcp:0824000107:68"/>

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0824000107:69"/> horns of a ſnail, and are hid at
the baſes of the ſpines, ſerving, as was ſaid before, for procuring
food and motion. All this apparatus, however, is only ſeen when the animal is
hunting its prey at the bottom of the water; for a few minutes after it is
taken, all the horns are withdrawn into the body, and moſt of the ſpines
drop off.</p>
               <p>It is generally ſaid of inſects, that thoſe which have the
greateſt number of legs, always move the ſloweſt: but this animal ſeems
to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the rule; for though furniſhed with two thouſand
ſpines, and twelve hundred horns, all ſerving for legs, and from their
number ſeeming to impede each other's motion, yet it runs with ſome ſhare
of ſwiftneſs at the bottom, and it is ſometimes no eaſy matter to
overtake it. It is often taken upon the ebb, by following it in ſhallow
water, either in an ozier baſket, or ſimply with the hand. Both the
ſpines and the horns aſſiſt its motion; and the animal is uſually
ſeen running with the mouth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Some kinds of this animal are as good eating as the lobſter;
and its eggs, which are of a deep red, are conſidered as a very great
deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. But of others the taſte is but indifferent; and in all places,
except the Mediterranean, they are little ſought for, except as objects of
curioſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0824000107:70"/>Very different in motion, though not much
different in ſhape from theſe, are the Acorn Shell-Fiſh, the Thumb-footed
Shell-Fiſh, and the Imaginary Barnacle. Theſe are fixed to one ſpot, and
appear to vegetate from a ſtalk. Indeed, to an inattentive ſpectator, each
actually ſeems to be a kind of fungus that grows in the deep, deſtitute of
animal life as well as motion. But the enquirer will ſoon change his opinion,
when he comes to obſerve this muſhroom-like figure more minutely. He will
then ſee that the animal reſiding within the ſhell has not only life, but
ſome degree of voraciouſneſs; that it has a cover, by which it opens and
ſhuts its ſhell at pleaſure; that it has twelve long crooked arms,
furniſhed with hair, which it thruſts forth for its prey; and eight
ſmaller, which are generally kept in the ſhell. They are ſeen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to every ſubſtance that is to be met with in the ocean; rocks, root of
trees, ſhips bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, whales, lobſters, and even crabs; like bunches of
grapes, clung to each other. It is amuſing enough to behold their
operations<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. They for ſome time remain motionleſs within their
ſhell; but when the ſea is calm, they are ſeen opening the lid, and
peeping about them. They then thruſt out their long neck, look 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0824000107:71"/> round them for ſome time, and then abruptly retreat back
into their box, ſhut their lid, and lurk in darkneſs and ſecurity. Some
people eat them; but they are in no great repute at the tables of the
luxurious, where their deformed figure would be no objection to their being
introduced.</p>
               <p>Of all animals of the ſhelly tribe, the Pholades are the
moſt wonderful. From their great powers of penetration, compared with their
apparent imbecility, they juſtly excite the aſtoniſhment of the curious
obſerver. Theſe animals are found in different places; ſometimes cloathed
in their proper ſhell, at the bottom of the water; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times concealed in
lumps of marly earth; and ſometimes lodged, ſhell and all, in the body of
the hardeſt marble. In their proper ſhell they aſſume different
figures; but, in general, they ſomewhat reſemble a muſcle, except that
their ſhell is found actually compoſed of five or more pieces, the
ſmaller valves ſerving to cloſe up the openings left by the irregular
meeting of the two principal ſhells. But their penetration into rocks, and
their reſidence there, makes up the moſt wonderful part of their
hiſtory.</p>
               <p>This animal, when diveſted of its ſhell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a
roundiſh, ſoft pudding, with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument that ſeems in the leaſt
fitted for boring <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0824000107:72"/> into ſtones, or even penetrating the
ſofteſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It is furniſhed with two teeth indeed; but
theſe are placed in ſuch a ſituation as to be incapable of touching the
hollow ſurface of its ſtony dwelling: it has alſo two covers to its
ſhell, that open and ſhut at either end; but theſe are totally
unſerviceable to it as a miner. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument with which it performs all
its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and buries itſelf in the hardeſt rocks, is only a broad
fleſhy ſubſtance, ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a tongue, that is ſeen
iſſuing from the bottom of its ſhell. With this ſoft, yielding
inſtrument, it perforates the moſt ſolid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and having, while yet
little and young, made its way, by a very narrow entrance, into the
ſubſtance of the ſtone, it then begins to grow bigger, and thus to
enlarge its apartment.</p>
               <p>The ſeeming unfitneſs, however, of this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal for
penetrating into rocks, and there form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an habitation, has induced many
philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers to ſuppoſe that they entered the rock while it was yet in
ſoft ſtate, and from the petrifying quality of the water, that the whole
rock afterwards hardened round them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Thus any penetrating quality,
it was thought, was unjuſtly aſcribed to them, as they only bored into a
ſoft ſubſtance, that was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by time. This opinion, however, has
been <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0824000107:73"/> confuted, in a very ſatisfactory manner, by Doctor
Bohads, who obſerved, that many of the pillars of the temple of Serapis at
Puteoli were penetrated by theſe animals. From thence he very juſtly
concludes, that the pholas muſt have pierced into them ſince they were
erected; for no workmen would have laboured a pillar into form; if it had been
honey-combed by worms in the quarry. In ſhort, there can be no doubt but that
the pillars were perfectly ſound when erected; and that the pholades have
attacked them, during that time in which they continued buried under water, by
means of the earthquake that ſwallowed up the city<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Bohadſch de Animalibus Marinis, p. 153.</bibl>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>From hence it appears that, in all nature, there is not a
greater inſtance of perſeverance and patience than what this animal is
ſeen to exhibit. Furniſhed with the blunteſt and ſofteſt augre, by
ſlow, ſucceſſive applications, it effects what other animals are
incapable of performing by force; penetrating the hardeſt bodies only with
its tongue. When, while yet naked and very ſmall, it has effected an
entrance, and has buried its body in the ſtone, it there continues for life
at its eaſe; the ſea water that enters at the little aperture ſupplying
it with luxurious plenty. When the animal has taken too great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0824000107:74"/> of water, it is ſeen to ſpurt it out of its hole with
ſome violence. Upon this ſeemingly thin diet, it quickly grows larger, and
ſoon finds itſelf under a neceſſity of enlarging its habitation and its
ſhell. The motion of the pholas is ſlow beyond conception; its progreſs
keeps pace with the growth of its body; and, in proportion as it becomes
larger, it makes its way farther into the rock. When it has got a certain way
in, it then turns from its former direction, and hollows downward; till, at
laſt, when its habitation is completed, the whole apartment reſembles the
bole of a tobacco pipe; the hole in the ſhank being that by which the animal
entered.</p>
               <p>Thus immured, the pholas lives in darkneſs, indolence, and
plenty; it never removes from the narrow manſion into which it has
penetrated; and ſeems perfectly content with being incloſed in its own
ſepulchre. The influx of the ſea-water, that enters by its little gallery,
ſatisfies all its wants; and, without any other food, it is found to grow
from ſeven to eight inches long, and thick in proportion.</p>
               <p>But they are not ſupplied only with their rocky habitation;
they have alſo a ſhell to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them: this ſhell grows upon them in
the body of the rock, and ſeems a very unneceſſary addition to their
defence, which they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0824000107:75"/> themſelves by art.
Theſe ſhells take dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent forms, and are often compoſed of a different
number of valves; ſometimes ſix; ſometimes but three; ſometimes the
ſhell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a tube with holes at either end, one for the mouth, and
the other for voiding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>
               <p>Yet the pholas thus ſhut up, is not ſo ſolitary an animal
as it would at firſt appear; for though it is immured in its hole without
egreſs, though it is impoſſible for the animal, grown to a great ſize,
to get out by the way it made in, yet many of this kind often meet in the heart
of the rock, and, like miners in a ſiege, who ſometimes croſs each
other's galleries, they frequently break in upon each other's retreats. Whether
their thus meeting be the work of accident or of choice, few can take upon them
to determine; certain it is, they are moſt commonly found in numbers in the
ſame rock; and ſometimes above twenty are diſcovered within a few inches
of each other.</p>
               <p>As to the reſt, this animal is found in greateſt numbers at
Ancona, in Italy; it is found along the ſhores of Normandy and Poitou, in
France; it is found alſo upon ſome of the coaſts of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: and, in
general, is conſidered as a very great delicacy, at the tables of the
luxurious.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of Frogs and Toads in General.</head>
               <p>IF we emerge from the deep, the firſt and moſt obvious
claſs of amphibious animals that occur upon land are frogs and toads.
Theſe, wherever they reſide, ſeem equally adapted for living upon land
and in the water, having their hearts formed in ſuch a manner as to
diſpenſe with the aſſiſtance of the lungs in carrying on the
circulation. The frog and the toad there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can live ſeveral days under
water, without any danger of ſuffocation; they want but little air at the
bottom; and, what is wanting, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by lungs, like bladders, which are
generally diſtended with wind, and anſwer all the purpoſes of a
reſervoir from whence to breathe.</p>
               <p>To deſcribe the form of animals ſo well known would be
ſuperfluous; to mark thoſe differences that diſtinguiſh them from each
other may be neceſſary. The frog moves by leaping; the toad crawls along
the ground: the frog is in general leſs than the toad; its colour is
brighter, and with a more poliſhed ſurface: the toad is brown, rough and
duſty. The frog is light and active, and its belly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively 
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0824000107:78"/> ſmall; the toad is ſlow, ſwolen, and incapable of
eſcaping. The frog, when taken, contracts itſelf ſo as to have a lump on
its back; the toad's back is ſtraight and even. Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts are
nearly the ſame, except that the lungs of the toad are more compact than
thoſe of the frog; they have fewer air-bladders, and of conſequence the
animal is leſs fitted for living under water. Such are the differences with
reſpect to figure and conformation; their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and manners exhibit a
greater variety, and require a ſeparate deſcription.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Frog and its Varieties.</head>
               <p>THE external figure of the Frog is too well known to need a
deſcription. Its power of taking large leaps is remarkably great, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the bulk of its body. It is the beſt ſwimmer of all four-footed animals;
and Nature hath finely adapted its parts for thoſe ends, the arms being light
and active, the legs and thighs long, and furniſhed with very ſtrong
muſcles.</p>
               <p>If we examine this animal internally, we ſhall find that it
has a very little brain for its ſize; a very wide ſwallow; a ſtomach
ſeemingly ſmall, but capable of great diſtenſion. The heart in the
frog, as in all other animals that are truly amphibious, has but one ventricle;
ſo that the blood can circulate without the aſſiſtance of the lungs,
while it keeps under water. The lungs reſemble a number of ſmall bladders
joined together, like the cells of a honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb: they are connected to the back
by muſcles, and can be diſtended or exhauſted at the animal's pleaſure.
The male has two teſticuli lying near the kidnies; and the female has two
ovaries, lying near the ſame place: but <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0824000107:80"/> neither male nor
female have any of the external inſtruments of generation; the anus ſerving
for that purpoſe in both. Such are the moſt ſtriking peculiarities in the
anatomy of a frog; and in theſe it agrees with the toad, the lizard, and the
ſerpent. They are all formed internally pretty much in the ſame manner,
with ſpongy lungs, a ſimple heart, and are deſtitute of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
inſtruments that ſerve to continue the kind.</p>
               <p>Of all thoſe who have given hiſtories of the frog, Mr.
Raeſel, of Nuremberg, ſeems the moſt accurate and entertaining. His
plates of this animal are well known; his aſſiduity and ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in
obſerving its manners are ſtill more deſerving our eſteem. Inſtead,
therefore, of following any other, I will take him for my guide; and though it
be out of my power to amuſe the reader with his beautiful deſigns, yet
there will be ſome merit in tranſcribing his hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Common Brown Frog begins to couple early in the ſeaſon,
and as ſoon as the ice is thawed from the ſtagnating waters. In ſome
places the cold protracts the irgenial appetite till April; but it generally
begins about the middle of March. The male is uſually of a greyiſh brown
colour; the female is more inclining to yellow, ſpeckled with brown. When
they <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0824000107:81"/> couple, the colours of both are nearly alike on the
back; but as they change their ſkins almoſt every eighth day, the old one
falling off in the form of a mucous, the male grows yellower, and the female
more brown. In the males the arms and legs are much ſtronger than in the
females; and, at the time of coupling, they have, upon their thumbs, a kind of
fleſhy excreſcence, which they fix firmly to the breaſt of the female.
This Linnaeus ſuppoſed to be the male inſtrument of generation; but, by
cloſer inſpection, it is found only of ſervice in holding the female in a
more ſtrict embrace. It may be cut off, and the impregnation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
unimpaired: it is ſometimes found in the oppoſite ſex; and ſome of the
males are found entirely without it: however, when it is cut off, the male
cannot hold the female ſo ſtrongly as before.</p>
               <p>The ſex couple only once a year; and then continue united
ſometimes for four days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. At this time they both have their bellies
greatly ſwolen; that of the female being filled with eggs: the male having
the ſkin of the whole body diſtended with a limpid water, which is ejected
in impregnation. As ſoon as the male has leaped upon the female, he throws
his fore legs round her breaſt, and cloſes them ſo firmly that it is
impoſſible with the naked <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0824000107:82"/> hands to looſe them. The
male claſps his fingers between each other, in the ſame manner as people
when they are praying; the thumbs preſs with their thickeſt ſides
againſt the breaſt of the female; and though ſhe ſhould ſtruggle ever
ſo much, nothing can induce him to let go his hold. The graſp ſeems
involuntary and convulſive; they cannot be eaſily torn aſunder; and they
ſwim, creep, and live united for ſome days ſucceſſively, till the
female has ſhed her ſpawn, which at length ſhe does almoſt in an
inſtant. But how the impregnation is performed, without any apparent
inſtruments of generation, has long been an object of enquiry; and ſtill
continues in great obſcurity. To inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate the difficulty as carefully
as poſſible, our German philoſopher continued to examine their mutual
congreſs for three years together, and availed himſelf of all the lights
that the knife, or analogy, could furniſh.</p>
               <p>After having choſen twelve couple of frogs that were thus
joined to each other, and having placed each couple in a glaſs veſſel
with water, he ſcarce let them out of his ſight day or night, and even
ſate up two nights together to examine their operations. The firſt day he
obſerved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that deſerved remark; but the ſecond they began to be
agitated more than before; the males made a noiſe ſomewhat reſembling the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0824000107:83"/> grunting of a hog; the females only kept ſinking and
riſing in the water.</p>
               <p>The male of the firſt couple ejected the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity with which
his body was ſwolen, by which the water in the glaſs was made muddy; and he
ſoon after quitted the female. Our philoſopher continued for twelve hours
to obſerve whether the female would caſt her ſpawn; but finding her
tardy, he diſſected both her and the male: in the latter, the ſpermatic
veſſels were quite empty, as might naturally have been ſuppoſed; but
for the female, her ſpawn ſtill remained in her body. Upon its being
extracted, and put into water, it periſhed without producing any animal
whatever. From hence he juſtly concluded, that it required that the eggs
ſhould be ejected from the body of the female before they could be at all
prolific. In another pair the male quitted the female, who did not eject her
ſpawn till ſixteen days after; and theſe, like the former, came to
nothing. But it was very different with ſome of the reſt. The females
ejected their ſpawn, while the male ſtill remained in his ſtation, and
impregnated the maſſes at different intervals as they fell from her; and
theſe all brought forth animals in the uſual courſe of generation. From
theſe obſervations it was eaſy to infer, that the female was impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0824000107:84"/> neither by the mouth, as ſome philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers imagined,
nor by the excreſcence at the thumbs, as was the opinion of Linnaeus, but by
the inſperſion of the male ſeminal fluid upon the eggs as they proceeded
from the body.</p>
               <p>A ſingle female produces from ſix to eleven hundred eggs at
a time; and, in general, ſhe throws them all out together by a ſingle
effort; though ſometimes ſhe is an hour in performing this taſk. While
ſhe is thus bringing forth, it may be obſerved, that the male acts the part
of a midwife, and promotes the expulſion of the eggs by working with his
thumbs, and compreſſing the female's body more cloſely. The eggs which
were compreſſed in the womb, upon being emitted, expand themſelves into a
round form, and drop to the bottom of the water, while the male ſwims off,
and ſtrikes with his arms as uſual, though they had continued ſo long in
a ſtate of violent contraction.</p>
               <p>The egg, or little black globe, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a tadpole, is
ſurrounded with two different kinds of liquor. That which immediately
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds the globe is clear and tranſparent, and contained in its proper
membrane; that which ſurrounds the whole is muddy and mucous. The
tranſparent liquor ſerves for the nouriſhment of the tadpole from time to
time; and anſwers <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0824000107:85"/> the ſame purpoſes that the white
of the egg does to birds. The tadpoles, when this mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is broken, are
found to adhere with their mouth to part of it; and when they get free, they
immediately ſink to the bottom of the water, never being able to get to the
top after while they continue in their tadpole form.</p>
               <p>But to return—When the ſpawn is emitted and impregnated
by the male, it drops, as was ſaid, to the bottom, and there the white
quickly and ſenſibly encreaſes. The eggs, which during the four firſt
hours ſuffer no perceptible change, begin then to enlarge and grow lighter;
by which means they mount to the ſurface of the water. At the end of eight
hours, the white in which they ſwim grows thicker, the eggs loſe their
Blackneſs, and as they encreaſe in ſize, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their ſpherical
form. The twenty-firſt day the egg is ſeen to open a little on one ſide,
and the beginning of a tail to peep out, which becomes more and more diſtinct
every day. The thirty-ninth day the little animal begins to have motion; it
moves at intervals its tail; and it is perceived that the liquor in which it is
circumfuſed, ſerves it for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In two days more, ſome of
theſe little creatures fall to the bottom; while others remain ſwimming in
the fluid around them, <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0824000107:86"/> while their vivacity and motion is
ſeen to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Thoſe which fall to the bottom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there the whole
day; but having length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened themſelves a little, for hitherto they are
doubled up, they mount at intervals to the mucous which they had quitted, and
are ſeen to feed upon it with great vivacity. The next day they acquire their
tadpole form. In three days more they are perceived to have two little fringes,
that ſerve as fins beneath the the head; and theſe in four days after
aſſume a more perfect form. It is then alſo that they are ſeen to feed
very greedily upon the pond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed with which they are to be ſupplied; and,
leaving their former food, on this they continue to ſubſiſt till they
arrive at maturity. When they come to be ninety-two days old, two ſmall feet
are ſeen beginning to burgeon near the tail; and the head appears to be
ſeparate from the body. The next day, the legs are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably enlarged;
four days after they refuſe all vegetable food; their mouth appears
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with teeth; and their hinder legs are completely formed. In two
days more the arms are completely produced; and now the frog is every way
perfect, except that it ſtill continues to carry the tail. In this odd
ſituation the animal, reſembling at once both a frog <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0824000107:87"/>
and a lizard, is ſeen frequently riſing to the ſurface, not to take food
but to breathe. In this ſtate it continues for about ſix or eight hours;
and then the tail dropping off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the animal appears in its moſt
perfect form.</p>
               <p>Thus the frog, in leſs than a day, having changed its figure,
is ſeen to change its appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites alſo. So extraordinary is this
transformation, that the food it fed upon ſo greedily but a few days before,
is now utterly rejected; it would even ſtarve if ſupplied with no other. As
ſoon as the animal acquires its perfect ſtate, from having fed upon
vegetables it becomes carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous, and lives entirely upon worms and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects. But as the water cannot ſupply theſe, it is obliged to quit its
native element, and ſeek for food upon land, where it lives by hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worms
and taking inſects by ſurprize. At firſt, being feeble and unable to bear
the warmth of the ſun, it hides among buſhes and under ſtones; but when a
ſhower comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the earth, then the whole multitude are ſeen to
quit their retreats, in order to enjoy the grateful humidity. Upon many
occaſions the ground is ſeen perfectly blackened with their numbers; ſome
hunting for prey, and ſome ſeeking ſecure lurking places. From the
myriads <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0824000107:88"/> that offer on ſuch occaſions, ſome have been
induced to think that theſe animals were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the clouds, and thus
ſhowered down on the earth. But had they, like Derham, traced them to the
next pool, they would have found out a better ſolution for the
difficulty.</p>
               <p>The frog lives for the moſt part out of the water; but when
the cold nights begin to ſet in, it returns to its native element, always
chuſing ſtagnant waters, where it can lie without danger concealed at the
bottom. In this manner it continues torpid, or with but very little motion, all
the winter: like the reſt of the dormant race, it requires no food; and the
circulation is ſlowly carried on without any aſſiſtance from the
air.</p>
               <p>It is at the approach of ſpring that all theſe animals are
rouzed from a ſtate of ſlumber to a ſtate of enjoyment. A ſhort time
after they riſe from the bottom they begin to pair, while thoſe that are as
yet too young come upon land before the reſt. For this reaſon, while the
old ones continue concealed in the beginning of ſpring, the ſmall ones are
more frequently ſeen; the former remaining in the lake to propagate, while
the latter are not yet arrived at a ſtate of maturity.</p>
               <p>The difference of ſexes, which was mentioned above, is not
perceivable in theſe animals, until <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0824000107:89"/> they have arrived at
their fourth year; nor do they begin to propagate, till they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted
that period. By comparing their ſlow growth with their other habitudes, it
would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that they live about twelve years; but having ſo many enemies,
both by land and water, it is probable that few of them arrive at the end of
their term.</p>
               <p>Frogs live upon inſects of all kinds; but they never eat any,
unleſs they have motion. They continue fixed and immovable till their prey
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; and juſt when it comes ſufficiently near, they jump forward with
great agility, dart out their tongues, and ſeize it with certainty. The
tongue, in this animal, as in the toad, lizard and ſerpent kinds, is
extremely long, and formed in ſuch a manner that it ſwallows the point down
its throat; ſo that a length of tongue is thus drawn out, like a ſword from
its ſcabbard, to aſſail its prey. This tongue is furniſhed with a
glutinous ſubſtance; and whatever inſect it touches, infallibly adheres,
and is thus held faſt till it is drawn into the mouth.</p>
               <p>As the frog is thus ſupplied with the power of catching its
prey, it is alſo very vivacious, and able to bear hunger for a very long
time. I have known one of them continue a month in ſummer without any other
food than the turf <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0824000107:90"/> on which it was placed in a glaſs
veſſel. We are told of a German ſurgeon, that kept one eight years in a
glaſs veſſel, covered with a net. Its food was at all times but
ſparing; in ſummer he gave it freſh graſs, which it is ſaid to have
fed upon; and, in the winter, hay, a little moiſtened: he likewiſe now and
then put flies into the glaſs, which it would follow with an open mouth, and
was very expert in catching them. In winter, when the flies were difficult to
be found, it uſually fell away, and grew very lean; but, in the ſummer,
when they were plenty, it ſoon grew fat again. It was kept in a warm room,
and was always lively and ready to take its prey; however, in the eighth
winter, when there were no flies to be found, it fell away and died. It is not
certain how long it might have lived, had it been ſupplied with proper
nouriſhment; but we are certain, that a very little food is capable of
ſufficing its neceſſities.</p>
               <p>Nor is the frog leſs tenacious of life. It will live and jump
about ſeveral hours after its head has been cut off. It will continue active,
though all its bowels are taken out; and it can live ſome days, though
entirely ſtripped of its ſkin. This cruel trick, which is chiefly
practiſed among ſchool-boys, of ſkinning frogs, an operation which is
done in an inſtant, ſeems for ſome hours <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0824000107:91"/> no way to
abate their vigour. I am aſſured that ſome of them get a new ſkin, and
recover after this painful experiment.</p>
               <p>The croaking of frogs is well known; and from thence, in ſome
countries, they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the ludicrous title of Dutch
Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingales. Indeed, the aquatic frogs of Holland are loud beyond what one
would imagine. We could hardly conceive that an animal, not bigger than one's
fiſt, ſhould be able to ſend forth a note that is heard at three miles
diſtance; yet ſuch is actually the caſe<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Raeſel, ibid.</bibl>
                  </note>. The large water frogs have a
note as loud as the bellowing of a bull; and, for this purpoſe, puff up their
cheeks to a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing magnitude. Of all frogs, however, the male only
croaks; the female is ſilent, and the voice in the other ſeems to be the
call to court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It is certain, that at theſe times when they couple,
the loudneſs of their croaking is in ſome places very troubleſome; for
then the whole lake ſeems vocal; and a thouſand diſſonant notes
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſtun the neighbourhood. At other times alſo, before wet weather,
their voices are in full exertion; they are then heard with unceaſing
aſſiduity, ſending forth their call, and welcoming the approaches of
their favourite moiſture. No weather-glaſs was ever ſo true as a frog in
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0824000107:92"/> an approaching change; and, in fact, the
German ſurgeon, mentioned above, kept his frog for that purpoſe. It was
always heard to croak at the approach of wet weather; but was as mute as a
fiſh, when it threatened a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of fair. This may probably ſerve to
explain an opinion which ſome entertain, that there is a month in the year,
called Paddock Moon, in which the frogs never croak: the whole ſeems to be no
more than that, in the hot ſeaſon, when the moiſture is dried away, and
conſequently when theſe animals neither enjoy the quantity of health or
food that at other times they are ſupplied with, they ſhew, by their
ſilence, how much they are diſpleaſed with the weather. All very dry
weather is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their health, and prevents them from getting their prey.
They ſubſiſt chiefly upon worms and ſnails; and as drought prevents
theſe from appearing, the frog is thus ſtinted in its proviſions, and
alſo wants that grateful humidity which moiſtens its ſkin, and renders it
alert and active.</p>
               <p>As frogs adhere cloſely to the backs of their own ſpecies,
ſo it has been found, by repeated experience, they will alſo adhere to the
backs of fiſhes. Few that have ponds, but know that theſe animals will
ſtick to the backs of carp, and fix their fingers in the corner of each eye.
In <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0824000107:93"/> this manner they are often caught together; the carp
blinded and waſted away. Whether this proceeds from the deſires of the
frog, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of its proper mate, or whether it be a natural enmity
between frogs and fiſhes, I will not take upon me to ſay. A ſtory told us
by Walton, might be apt to incline us to the latter opinion.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"As Dubravius, a biſhop of Bohemia, was
walking with a friend by a large pond in that country, they ſaw a frog, when
the pike lay very ſleepily and quiet by the ſhore ſide, leap upon his
head, and the frog having expreſſed malice or anger by his ſwolen cheeks
and ſtaring eyes, did ſtretch out his legs, and embraced the pike's head,
and preſently reached them to his eyes, tearing with them and his teeth
thoſe tender parts; the pike, irritated with anguiſh, moves up and down the
water, and rubs himſelf againſt weeds, and whatever he thought might quit
him of his enemy; but all in vain, for the frog did continue to ride
triumphantly, and to bite and torment the pike till his ſtrength failed, and
then the frog ſunk with the pike to the bottom of the water: then preſently
the frog appeared again at the top and croaked, and ſeemed to rejoice like a
conqueror; after <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0824000107:94"/> which he preſently retired to his
ſecret hole. The biſhop that had beheld the battle, called his fiſherman
to fetch his nets, and by all means to get the pike, that they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the Toad and its Varieties.</head>
               <p>IF we regard the figure of the Toad, there ſeems nothing in it
that ſhould diſguſt more than that of the frog. Its form and proportions
are nearly the ſame; and it chiefly differs in colour, which is blacker; and
its ſlow and heavy motion, which exhibits nothing of the agility of the frog:
yet ſuch is the force of habit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in early prejudice, that thoſe who
conſider the one as an harmleſs, playful animal, turn from the other with
horror and diſguſt. The frog is conſidered as a uſeful aſſiſtant,
in ridding our grounds of vermin; the toad, as a ſecret enemy, that only
wants an opportunity to infect us with its venom.</p>
               <p>The imagination, in this manner biaſſed by its terrors,
paints out the toad in the moſt hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous colouring, and cloaths it in more
than natural deformity. Its body is broad; its back flat; covered with a
duſky, pimpled hide; the belly is large and ſwagging; the pace laboured and
crawling; its retreat gloomy and filthy; and its whole appearance calculated to
excite diſguſt and horror: yet upon my firſt ſeeing a 
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0824000107:96"/> toad, none of all theſe deformities in the leaſt
affected me with ſenſations of loathing: born, as I was, in a country where
there are no toads, I had prepared my imagination for ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful object;
but there ſeemed nothing to me more alarming in the ſight, than in that of
a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon frog; and indeed, for ſome time, I miſtook and handled the one
for the other. When firſt informed of my miſtake, I very well remember my
ſenſations: I wondered how I had eſcaped with ſafety, after handling
and diſſecting a toad, which I had miſtaken for a frog. I then began to
lay in a fund of horror againſt the whole tribe, which, though convinced they
are harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I ſhall never get rid of. My firſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations were too
ſtrong not only for my reaſon, but for the conviction of my ſenſes.</p>
               <p>As the toad bears a general reſemblance of figure to the frog,
ſo alſo it reſembles that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in its nature and appetites. Like the
frog, the toad is amphibious; like that animal, it lives upon worms and
inſects, which it ſeizes by dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out its length of tongue; and in the
ſame manner alſo it crawls about in moiſt weather. The male and female
couple as in all the frog kind; their time of propagation being very early in
the ſpring. Sometimes the females are ſeen upon land, oppreſſed by the
males; but <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0824000107:97"/> more frequently they are coupled in the water.
They continue together ſome hours, and adhere ſo faſt as to tear the very
ſkin from the parts they ſtick to. In all this they entirely reſemble the
frog; but the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which the male lends the female, in bringing
forth, is a peculiarity in this ſpecies that muſt not be paſſed over in
ſilence. 
<q rend="inline">"In the evening of a ſummer's day, a French
gentleman, being in the king's gardens at Paris, perceived two toads coupled
together, and he ſtopped to examine them. Two facts equally new ſurprized
him: the firſt was the extreme difficulty the female had in laying her eggs;
the ſecond was the aſſiſtance lent her by the male for this purpoſe.
The eggs of the female lie in her body, like beads on a ſtring; and after the
firſt, by great effort, was excluded, the male caught it with his hinder
paws, and kept working it till he had thus extracted the whole chain. In this
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the animal performed, in ſome meaſure, the functions of a midwife;
impregnating, at the ſame time, every egg as it iſſued from the
body."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is probable, however, that this difficulty in bringing forth,
obtains only upon land; and that the toad, which produces its ſpawn in the 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0824000107:98"/> water, performs it with as much eaſe as a frog. They
propagate in England, exactly in the manner of frogs; and the female, inſtead
of retiring to dry holes, goes to the bottom of ponds, and there lies torpid
all the winter, preparing to propagate in the beginning of ſpring. On theſe
occaſions, the number of males is found greatly to ſurpaſs that of the
other ſex, there being above thirty to one; and twelve or fourteen are often
ſeen clinging to the ſame female.</p>
               <p>When, like the frog, they have undergone all the variations of
their tadpole ſtate, they forſake the water; and are often ſeen, in a
moiſt ſummer's evening, crawling up, by myriads, from fenny places, into
drier ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. There, having found out a retreat, or having dug
themſelves one with their mouth and hands, they lead a patient, ſolitary
life, ſeldom venturing out, except when the moiſture of a ſummer's
evening invites them abroad. At that time the graſs is filled with ſnails,
and the pathways covered with worms, which make their principal food. Inſects
alſo of every kind they are fond of; and we have the authority of Linnaeus
for it, that they ſometimes continue immovable, with the mouth open, at the
bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of ſhrubs, where the butterflies, in ſome <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0824000107:99"/>
meaſure faſcinated, are ſeen to fly down their throats<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>In a letter from Mr. Arſcott, there are ſome curious
particulars relating to this animal, which throws great light upon its
hiſtory. 
<q rend="inline">"Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the toad," ſays he, "that lived
ſo many years with us, and was ſo great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, the greateſt
curioſity was its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſo remarkably tame: it had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented ſome
ſteps before our hall door ſome years before my acquaintance commenced with
it, and had been admired by my father for its ſize (being the largeſt I
ever met with) who conſtantly paid it a viſit every evening. I knew it
myſelf above thirty years; and by conſtantly feeding it, brought it to be
ſo tame, that it always came to the candle and looked up, as if expecting to
be taken up and brought upon the table, where I always fed it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects
of all ſorts. It was fondeſt of fleſh mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, which I kept in bran; it
would follow them, and when within a proper diſtance, would fix his eyes and
remain motionleſs for near a quarter of a minute, as if preparing for the
ſtroke, which was an inſtantaneous throwing its tongue at a great
diſtance upon <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0824000107:100"/> the inſect, which ſtuck to the tip by
a glutinous matter. The motion is quicker than the eye can follow. I cannot
ſay how long my father had been acquainted with the toad, before I knew it;
but when I was firſt acquainted with it, he uſed to mention it as the old
toad I have known ſo many years. I can anſwer for thirty-ſix years. This
old toad made its appearance as ſoon as the warm weather came; and I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
concluded it retired to ſome dry bank, to repoſe till ſpring. When we new
layed the ſteps, I had two holes made in the third ſtep, on each with a
hollow of more than a yard long for it; in which I imagine it ſlept, as it
came from thence at its firſt appearance. It was ſeldom provoked. Neither
that toad, nor the multitudes I have ſeen tormented with great cruelty, ever
ſhewed the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revenge, by ſpitting or emitting any juice
from their pimples. Sometimes, upon taking it up, it would let out a great
quantity of clear water, which, as I have often ſeen it do the ſame upon
the ſteps when quite quiet, was certainly its urine, and no more than a
natural evacuation. Spiders, millepedes, and fleſh maggots, ſeem to be this
animal's favourite food. I imagine if a bee was to be put before a toad, it
would certainly eat it <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0824000107:101"/> to its coſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Raeſel tried a frog; it ſwallowed the bee alive: its ſtomach
was ſtung, and the animal vomited it up again.</note>; but as bees are
ſeldom ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at the ſame time that toads are, they rarely come in
their way; as they do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear after ſun-riſing, or before ſun-ſet.
In the heat of the day they will come to the mouth of their hole, I believe for
air. I once, from my parlour window, obſerved a large toad I had in the bank
of a bowling-green, about twelve at noon, a very hot day, very buſy and
active upon the graſs. So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common an appearance made me go out to ſee
what it was; when I found an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſwarm of winged ants had dropped
round his hole; which temptation was as ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible as a turtle would be
to a luxurious alderman. In reſpect to its end, had it not been for a tame
raven, I make no doubt but it would have been now living. This bird, one day
ſeeing it at the mouth of its hole, pulled it out, and, although I reſcued
it, pulled out one eye, and hurt it ſo, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its living a
twelve-month, it never enjoyed itſelf, and had a difficulty of taking its
food, miſſing the mark for want of its eye. Before that accident, it had
all the appearance of perfect health."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0824000107:102"/>To this account of the toad's inoffenſive
qualities, I will add another from Valiſnieri, to ſhew that, even taken
internally, the toad is no way dangerous. 
<q rend="inline">"In the year 1692, ſome German ſoldiers, who
had taken poſſeſſion of the caſtle of Arceti, finding that the
peaſants of the country often amuſed themſelves in catching frogs, and
dreſſing them for the table; reſolved to provide themſelves with a like
entertainment, and made preparations for frog fiſhing, in the ſame manner.
It may eaſily be ſuppoſed that the Italians and their German gueſts
were not very fond of each other; and indeed it is natural to think that the
ſoldiers gave the poor people of the country many good reaſons for
diſcontent. They were not a little pleaſed, therefore, when they ſaw them
go to a ditch where toads inſtead of frogs were found in abundance. The
Germans, no way diſtinguiſhing, in their ſport caught them in great
numbers; while the peaſants kept looking on, ſilently flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
themſelves with the hopes of ſpeedy revenge. After being brought home, the
toads were dreſſed up, after the Italian faſhion; the peaſants quite
happy at ſeeing their tyrants devour them with ſo good an appetite, and
expecting every moment to ſee <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0824000107:103"/> them drop down dead: But
what was their ſurprize to find, that the Germans continued as well as ever,
and only complained of a ſlight excoriation of the lips, which probably
aroſe from ſome other cauſe than that of their repaſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I will add another ſtory, from Solenander; who tells us, that
a tradeſman of Rome and his wife had long lived together with mutual
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; the man was dropſical, and the woman amorous: this ill-matched
ſociety promiſed ſoon, by the very infirm ſtate of the man, to have an
end; but the woman was unwilling to wait the progreſs of the diſorder; and
therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that, to get rid of her huſband, nothing was left her
but poiſon. For this purpoſe, ſhe choſe out a doſe that ſhe
ſuppoſed would be the moſt effectual; and having calcined ſome toads,
mixed their powder with his drink. The man, after taking a hearty doſe, found
no conſiderable inconvenience, except that it greatly promoted urine. His
wife, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered this as a beginning ſymptom of the venom, reſolved
not to ſtint the next doſe, but gave it in greater quantites than before.
This alſo encreaſed the former ſymptom; and, in a few days, the woman had
the mortification to ſee her deteſted huſband reſtored to perfect 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0824000107:104"/> health; and remained in utter deſpair of ever being a
widow.</p>
               <p>From all this it will appear with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice this animal
has hitherto been treated. It has undergone every reproach; and mankind have
been taught to conſider as an enemy, a creature that deſtroys that infect
tribe which are their real invaders. We are to treat, therefore, as fables,
thoſe accounts that repreſent the toad as poſſeſſed of poiſon to
kill at a diſtance; of its ejecting its venom, which burns wherever it
touches; of its infecting thoſe vegetables near which it reſides; of its
exceſſive fondneſs for ſage, which it renders poiſonous by its
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: theſe, and an hundred others of the ſame kind, probably took
riſe from an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy which ſome have to all animals of the kind. It is
an harmleſs, defenceleſs creature, torpid and unvenemous, and ſeeking the
darkeſt retreats, not from the malignity of its nature, but the multitude of
its enemies.</p>
               <p>Like all of the frog kind, the toad is torpid in winter. It
chuſes then for a retreat either the hollow root of a tree, the cleft of a
rock, or ſometimes the bottom of a pond, where it is found in a ſtate of
ſeeming inſenſibility. As it is very long lived, it is very difficult to
be killed; its ſkin is tough and cannot be eaſily <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0824000107:105"/>
pierced; and, though covered with wounds, the animal continues to ſhew
ſigns of life, and every part appears in motion. But what ſhall we ſay to
its living for centuries lodged in the boſom of a rock, or caſed within the
body of an oak tree, without the ſmalleſt acceſs on any ſide either for
nouriſhment or air, and yet taken out alive and perfect! Stories of this kind
it would be as raſh to contradict as difficult to believe; we have the
higheſt authorities bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their truth, and yet the whole
ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of nature ſeems to arraign them of falſehood. Bacon aſſerts
that toads are found in this manner; Doctor Plot aſſerts the ſame; there
is to this day a marble chimney-piece at Chatſworth with the print of the
toad upon it, and a tradition of the manner in which it was found. In the
Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences there is an account of a toad found alive
and healthy in the heart of a very thick elm, without the ſmalleſt entrance
or egreſs<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Vide the Year 1719.</bibl>
                  </note>. In
the year 1731 there was another found near Nants in the heart of an old oak,
without the ſmalleſt iſſue to its cell; and the diſcoverer was of
opinion, from the ſize of the tree, that the animal could not have been
confined there leſs than eighty or a hundred years, without ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0824000107:106"/> and without air. To all theſe we can only oppoſe the
ſtrangeneſs of the facts; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity this animal appears under of
receiving air; and its dying like all others in the air-pump, when deprived of
this all-ſuſtaining fluid. But whether theſe be objections to weigh
againſt ſuch reſpectable and diſintereſted authority, I will not
pretend to determine; certain it is that, if kept in a damp place, the toad
will live for ſeveral months without any food whatſoever.</p>
               <p>To this extraordinary account, which is doubtful, I will add
another not leſs ſo; which is that of toads ſucking cancerous breaſts,
and thus extracting the venom and performing a cure. The firſt account we
have of this is in a letter to the Biſhop of Carliſle from Doctor Pitfield,
who was the firſt perſon of conſequence that attended the experiment. His
letter is as follows.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Your lordſhip muſt have taken notice of a
paragraph in the papers with regard to the application of toads to a cancered
breaſt. A patient of mine has ſent to the neighbourhood of Hungerford, and
brought down the very woman on whom the cure was done. I have, with all the
attention I am capable of, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the operation for eighteen or twenty days,
and am ſurprized at the phenomenon. <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0824000107:107"/> I am in no
expectation of any great ſervice from the application; the age,
conſtitution, and thoroughly cancerous condition of the perſon, being
unconquerable barriers to it. How an ailment of that kind, abſolutely local,
in an otherwiſe ſound habit and of a likely age, might be relieved I cannot
ſay. But as to the operation, thus much I can aſſert, that there is
neither pain nor nauſeouſneſs in it. The animal is put into a linen bag
all but its head, and that is held to the part. It has generally inſtantly
laid hold of the fouleſt part of the ſore, and ſucked with greedineſs
until it dropped off dead. It has frequently happened that the creature has
ſwolen immediately, and from its agonies appeared to be in great pain. I have
weighed them for ſeveral days together, before and after the application, and
found their encreaſe of weight, in the different degrees, from a drachm to
near an ounce. They frequently ſweat exceedingly, and turn quite pale;
ſometimes they diſgorge, recover, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lively again: I think the
whole ſcene is ſurprizing, and a very remarkable piece of natural
hiſtory. From the conſtant inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiveneſs which I have obſerved in
them, I almoſt queſtion the truth of their poiſonous 
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0824000107:108"/> ſpitting. Many people here expect no great good from
the application of toads to cancers; and where the diſorder is not
abſolutely local none is to be expected. When it is ſeated in any part not
to be well come at for extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, I think it is hardly to be imagined, but
that the having it ſucked clean as often as you pleaſe, muſt give great
relief. Every body knows that dogs licking of ſores cures them, which is I
ſuppoſe chiefly by keeping them clean. If there is any credit to be given
to hiſtory, poiſons have been ſucked out. 
<q rend="inline">
                        <hi>Pallentina vulnera lambit ore venena
trakens,</hi>
                     </q> are the words of Lucan on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. If the people to
whom theſe words are applied did their cure by immediately following the
injection of the poiſon, the local confinement of another poiſon brings the
caſe to a great degree of ſimilarity. I hope I have not tired your
Lordſhip with my long tale: as it is a true one, and in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion a
curious piece of natural hiſtory, I could not forbear communicating it to
you. I own I thought the ſtory in the papers to be an invention; and when I
conſidered the inſtructive principle in all animals of
ſelf-preſervation, I was confirmed in my diſbelief: but what I have
related I ſaw; and all theory <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0824000107:109"/> muſt yield to fact. It
is only the Rubeth, the land toad, which has the property of ſucking: I
cannot find any the leaſt mention of the property in any one of the old
natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts. My patient can bear to have but one applied in twenty-four
hours. The woman who was cured had them on day and night without
intermiſſion for five weeks. Their time of hanging at the breaſt has been
from one to ſix hours."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Other remarks made upon their method of performing this
extraordinary operation are as follow. 
<q rend="inline">"Some toads die very ſoon after they have
ſucked; others live about a quarter of an hour, and ſome much longer. For
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, one that was applied about ſeven o'clock ſucked till ten, and
died as ſoon as it was taken from the breaſt: another that immediately
ſucceeded continued till three o'clock, but dropped dead from the wound: each
ſwelled exceedingly, and of a pale colour. They do not ſeem to ſuck
greedily, and often turn their heads away; but during the time of their
ſucking, they were heard to ſmack their lips like a young child<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>From this circumſtantial account of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this
extraordinary application, one could <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0824000107:110"/> hardly ſuppoſe
that any doubt could remain of the ingenious obſerver's accuracy; and yet,
from informations which I have received, from authority ſtill more
reſpectable, there is much reaſon as yet to ſuſpend our aſſent. A
lady, who was under the care of the preſent preſident of the college of
phyſicians, was induced, by her friends, to try the experiment; and as he
ſaw the caſe was deſperate, and that it would quiet her mind as well as
theirs, he permitted the trial. During the whole continuance of their
application, ſhe could never thoroughly perceive that they ſucked her; but
that did not prevent their ſwelling and dying, as in the former inſtances.
Once indeed, ſhe ſaid, ſhe thought that one of them ſeemed to ſuck;
but the phyſician, and thoſe who attended, could not perceive any
appearance of it. Thus, after all, it is a doubt whether theſe animals die by
the internal or the external application of the cancerous poiſon.</p>
               <p>Of this animal there are ſeveral varieties; ſuch as the
Water and the Land Toad, which probably differ only in the ground-colour of
their ſkin. In the firſt, it is more inclining to aſh-colour, with brown
ſpots; in the other, the colour is brown, approaching to black. The water
toad is not ſo large as the other; <pb facs="tcp:0824000107:111"/>

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0824000107:112"/> but both equally breed in that
element. The ſize of the toad with us is generally from two to four inches
long; but, in the fenny countries of Europe, I have ſeen them much larger;
and not leſs than a common crab, when brought to table. But this is nothing
to what they are found in ſome of the tropical climates, where travellers
often, for the firſt time, miſtake a toad for a tortoiſe. Their uſual
ſize is from ſix to ſeven inches; but there are ſome ſtill larger,
and as broad as a plate. Of theſe ſome are beautifully ſtreaked and
coloured; ſome ſtudded over, as if with pearls; others briſtled with
horns or ſpines; ſome have the head diſtinct from the body, while others
have it ſo ſunk in, that the animal appears without a head. All theſe are
found in the tropical climates, in great abundance; and particularly after a
ſhower of rain. It is then that the ſtreets ſeem entirely paved with
them; they then crawl from their retreats, and go into all places, to enjoy
their favourite moiſture. With us the opinion of its raining toads and frogs,
has long been juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, but it ſtill is entertained in the tropical
countries; and that not only by the ſavage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, but the more refined
ſettlers, who are apt enough to add the prejudices of other nations to their
own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0824000107:113"/>It would be a tedious, as well as a
uſeleſs taſk, to enter into all the minute diſcriminations of theſe
animals, as found in different countries or places; but the Pipal, or the
Surinam Toad, is too ſtrange a creature, not to require an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
deſcription. There is not perhaps, in all nature, a more extraordinary
phenomenon, than that of an animal breeding and hatching its young in its back;
from whence, as from a kind of hot bed, they crawl, one after the other, when
come to maturity.</p>
               <p>The pipal is in form more hideous than even the common toad,
Nature ſeeming to have marked all thoſe ſtrange mannered ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals with
peculiar deformity. The body is flat and broad; the head ſmall; the jaws,
like thoſe of a mole, are extended, and evidently formed for rooting in the
ground: the ſkin of the neck forms a ſort of wrinkled collar: the colour of
the head is of a dark cheſnut, and the eyes are ſmall: the back, which is
very broad, is of a lightiſh grey, and ſeems covered over with a number of
ſmall eyes, which are round, and placed at nearly equal diſtances. Theſe
eyes are very different from what they ſeem; they are the animal's eggs,
covered with their ſhells, and placed there for hatching. Theſe eggs are
buried deep in the ſkin, and in <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0824000107:114"/> the beginning of
incubation but juſt appear; and are very viſible when the young animal is
about to burſt from its confinement. They are of a reddiſh, ſhining
yellow colour; and the ſpaces between them are full of ſmall warts,
reſembling pearls.</p>
               <p>This is their ſituation, previous to their coming forth; but
nothing ſo much demands our admiration, as the manner of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.
The eggs, when formed in the ovary, are ſent, by ſome internal canals,
which ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts have not hitherto deſcribed, to lie and come to maturity
under the bony ſubſtance of the back: in this ſtate they are impregnated
by the male, whoſe ſeed finds its way by pores very ſingularly contrived,
and pierces not only the ſkin but the perioſteum: the ſkin, however, is
ſtill apparently entire, and forms a very thick covering over the whole
brood; but as they advance to maturity, at different intervals, one after
another, the egg ſeems to ſtart forward and burgeon from the back, becomes
more yellow, and at laſt breaks; when the young one puts forth its head: it
ſtill, however, keeps its ſituation, until it has acquired a proper degree
of ſtrength, and then it leaves the ſhell, but ſtill continues to keep
upon the back of the parent. In this manner the pipal is ſeen travelling with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0824000107:115"/> her wonderous family on her back, in all the different
ſtages of maturity. Some of the ſtrange progeny, not yet come to
ſufficient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, appear quite torpid, and as yet without life in the
egg: others ſeem juſt beginning to riſe through the ſkin; here peeping
forth from the ſhell; and there, having entirely forſaken their priſon:
ſome are ſporting at large upon the parent's back; and others deſcending
to the ground, to try their own fortune below.</p>
               <p>Such is the deſcription given us of this ſtrange production,
by Seba; in which he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from Ruyſch, who affirms, that the young ones
are bred in the back of the male only, where the female lays her eggs. I have
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Seba, however; not becauſe he is better authority, but becauſe he
is more poſitive of the truth of his account, and aſſerts, aſſuredly,
that the eggs are found on the back of the female only. Many circumſtances,
however, are wanting towards completing his inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; ſuch as a
deſcription of the paſſage by which the egg finds its way into the back;
the manner of its fecundation; the time of geſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as alſo an hiſtory
of the manners of this ſtrange animal itſelf: but, by a prolixity that too
much prevails among naturaliſts at preſent, he leaves the moſt
intereſting object of curioſity, <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0824000107:116"/> to give us a
detailed deſcription of the legs and claws of the pipal, about which we have
very little concern.</p>
               <p>The male pipal is every way larger than the female, and has the
ſkin leſs tightly drawn round the body. The whole body is covered with
puſtules, reſembling pearls; and the belly, which is of a bright yellow,
ſeems as if it were ſewed up from the throat to the vent, a ſeam being
ſeen to run in that direction. This ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, like the reſt of the frog
kind, is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably harmleſs; though we are told of terrible effects
reſulting from its powder when calcined. This, however, muſt certainly be
falſe: no creature whatever, when calcined, can be poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous; for the fire
burns away whatever might have been dangerous in their compoſition: all
animal ſubſtances, when calcined, being entirely the ſame.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of Lizards in General.</head>
               <p>THERE is ſcarce a naturaliſt that has treated of Lizards,
but has a particular manner of ranking them, in the ſcale of animated nature.
Ray, rather ſtruck with the number of their legs, than their habits and
conformation, has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted them among quadrupedes; while Linnaeus, attentive
only to their long ſlender forms, has degraded them among ſerpents.
Briſſon gives them a diſtinct claſs by themſelves, under the name of
Reptiles. Klein gives them a claſs inferior to beaſts, under the name of
Naked Quadrupedes. Some, in ſhort, from their ſcaly covering, and
fondneſs for the water, have given them to the fiſhes; while there have not
been wanting naturaliſts who have claſſed them with inſects, as the
ſmaller kinds of this claſs ſeem to demand.</p>
               <p>It is indeed no eaſy matter to tell to what claſs in nature
lizards are chiefly allied. They are unjuſtly raiſed to the rank of
beaſts, as they bring forth eggs, diſpenſe with breathing, and are not
covered with hair. They cannot be placed among fiſhes, as the majority of
them <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0824000107:118"/> live upon land: they are excluded from the
ſerpent tribe, by their feet, upon which they run with ſome celerity; and
from the inſects, by their ſize; for though the Newt may be looked upon in
this contemptible light, a Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile would be a terrible inſect indeed. Thus
lizards are, in ſome meaſure, excluded from every rank; while they exhibit
ſomewhat of the properties of all; the legs and celerity of the quadrupede; a
facility of creeping through narrow and intricate ways, like the ſerpent; and
a power of living in the water, like fiſhes: however, though endued with
theſe various powers, they have no real advantages over any other claſs of
animated nature; for what they gain in aptitude for one element, they loſe in
their fitneſs for another. Thus, between both, they are an aukward, ungainly
tribe; neither ſo alert upon land, nor ſo nimble in the water, as the
reſpective inhabitants of either abode: and, indeed, this holds through all
nature, that, in proportion as the ſeeming advantages of inferior animals are
multiplied, their real ones are abridged; and all their inſtincts are
weakened and loſt, by the variety of channels into which they are
divided.</p>
               <p>As lizards thus differ from every other claſs of animals, they
alſo differ widely from each <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0824000107:119"/> other. With reſpect to
ſize, no claſs of beings has its ranks ſo oppoſite. What, for
inſtance, can be more removed than the ſmall Cameleon, an inch long, and
the Alligator of the river Amazons, above twenty-ſeven feet? To an
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive obſerver, they would appear entirely of different kinds; and
Seba wonders how they ever came to be claſſed together.</p>
               <p>The colour of theſe animals alſo is very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as they
are found of a hundred different hues, green, blue, red, cheſnut, yellow,
ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſtreaked, and marbled. Were colour alone capable of
conſtituting beauty, the lizard would often pleaſe; but there is
ſomething ſo repreſſing in the animal's figure, that the brilliancy of
its ſcales, or the variety of its ſpots, only tend to give an air of more
exquiſite venom of greater malignity. The figure of theſe animals is not
leſs various: ſometimes ſwolen in the belly; ſometimes purſed up at
the throat; ſometimes with a rough ſet of ſpines on the back, like the
teeth of a ſaw; ſometimes with teeth, at others with none; ſometimes
venomous, at others harmleſs, and even philanthropic: ſometimes ſmooth
and even; ſometimes with a long, ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tail; and often with a ſhorter
blunt one.</p>
               <p>But their greateſt diſtinction ariſes from their manner of
bringing forth their young. Firſtly, <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0824000107:120"/> ſome of them
are viviparous. Secondly, ſome are oviparous; and which may be conſidered
in three diſtinct ways. Thirdly, ſome bring forth ſmall ſpawn, like
fiſhes. The Crocodile, the Iguana, and all the larger kinds, bring forth
eggs, which are hatched by the heat of the ſun: the animals that iſſue
from them are complete upon leaving the ſhell; and their firſt efforts are
to run to ſeek food in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per element. The viviparous kinds, in which
are all the ſalamanders, come forth alive from the body of the female,
perfect and active, and ſuffer no ſucceeding change. But thoſe which are
bred in the water, and, as we have reaſon to think, from ſpawn, ſuffer a
very conſiderable change in their form. They are produced with an external
ſkin or covering, that ſometimes encloſes their feet, and gives them a
ſerpentine appearance. To this falſe ſkin, fins are added, above and
below the tail, that ſerve the animal for ſwimming; but when the falſe
ſkin drops off, theſe drop off alſo; and then the lizard, with its four
feet, is completely formed, and forſakes the water.</p>
               <p>From hence it appears, that of this tribe there are three
diſtinct kinds, differently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and moſt probably very different in
their formation. But the hiſtory of theſe animals is <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0824000107:121"/>
very obſcure; and we are as yet incapable of laying the line that ſeparates
them. All we know, as was ſaid before, is, that the great animals of this
kind are <hi>moſtly</hi> produced perfect from the egg; the ſalamanders are
<hi>generally</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viparous; and <hi>ſome</hi> of the water lizards
imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly produced. In all theſe moſt unfiniſhed productions of
Nature, if I may ſo call them, the varieties in their ſtructure encreaſes
in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their imperfections. A poet would ſay, that Nature grew
tired of the nauſeous formation; and left accident to finiſh the reſt of
her handy work.</p>
               <p>However, the three kinds have many points of ſimilitude; and,
in all their varieties of figure, colour, and production, this tribe is
eaſily diſtinguiſhed, and ſtrongly marked. They have all four ſhort
legs; the two fore feet ſomewhat reſembling a man's hand and arm. They have
tails almoſt as thick as the body at the beginning, and that generally run
tapering to a point. They are all amphibious alſo; equally capable of living
upon land and water; and formed internally in the ſame manner with the
tortoiſe, and other animals, that can continue a long time without
reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in other words, their lungs are not ſo neceſſary to
continue life and circulation, <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0824000107:122"/> but that their play may
be ſtopped for ſome conſiderable time, while the blood performs its
circuit round the body by a ſhorter commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
               <p>Theſe are differences that ſufficiently ſeparate lizards
from all other animals; but it will be very difficult to fix the limits that
diſtinguiſh the three kinds from each other. The <hi>crocodile</hi> tribe,
and its affinities, are ſufficiently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all the reſt,
by their ſize and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the <hi>ſalamander</hi> tribe is
diſtinguiſhed by their deformity, their frog-like heads, the ſhortneſs
of their ſnouts, their ſwolen belly, and their viviparous production. With
regard to the reſt, which we may denominate the cameleon or lizard kind,
ſome of which bring forth from the egg, and ſome of which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly
formed from ſpawn, we muſt groupe them under one head, and leave time to
unravel the reſt of their hiſtory.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of the Crocodile and its Affinities.</head>
               <p>THE Crocodile is an animal placed at a happy diſtance from the
inhabitants of Europe, and formidable only in thoſe regions where men are
ſcarce, and arts are but little known. In all the cultivated and populous
parts of the world, the great animals are entirely baniſhed, or rarely
ſeen. The appearance of ſuch raiſes at once a whole country up in arms to
oppoſe their force; and their lives generally pay the forfeit of their
temerity. The crocodile, therefore, that was once ſo terrible along the banks
of the river Nile, is now neither ſo large, nor its numbers ſo great as
formerly. The arts of mankind have, through a courſe of ages, powerfully
operated to its deſtruction; and, though it is ſometimes ſeen, it appears
comparatively ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and feeble.</p>
               <p>To look for this animal in all its natural terrors, grown to an
enormous ſize, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in ſurprizing numbers, and committing

arts have never penetrated, where force only makes diſtinction, and the
moſt powerful animals exert their ſtrength with confidence and ſecurity.
Thoſe that ſail up the river Amazons, or the river Niger, well know how
numerous and terrible thoſe animals are in ſuch parts of the world. In both
theſe rivers, they are found from eighteen to twenty-ſeven feet long; and
ſometimes lying as cloſe to each other, as a raft of timber upon one of our
ſtreams. There they indolently baſk on the ſurface, no way diſturbed at
the approach of an enemy, ſince, from the repeated trials of their
ſtrength, they found none that they were not able to ſubdue.</p>
               <p>Of this terrible animal there are two kinds; the Crocodile,
properly ſo called, and the Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Alligator. Travellers, however, have
rather made the diſtinction than Nature; for in the general outline, and in
the nature of theſe two animals they are entirely the ſame. It would be
ſpeaking more properly to call theſe animals the Crocodiles of the
eaſtern and the weſtern world; for in books of voyages, they are ſo
entirely confounded together, that there is no knowing whether the Aſiatic
animal be the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile of Aſia, or the alligator of the weſtern world.
The diſtinctions uſually made between <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0824000107:126"/> the crocodile
and alligator are theſe: the body of the crocodile is more ſlender than
that of the alligator; its ſnout runs off tapering from the forehead, like
that of a greyhound; while that of the other is indented, like the noſe of a
lap-dog. The crocodile has a much wider ſwallow, and is of an aſh-colour;
the alligator is black, varied with white, and is thought not to be ſo
miſchievous. All theſe diſtinctions, however, are very ſlight, and can
be reckoned little more than minute variations.</p>
               <p>This animal grows to a great length, being ſometimes found
thirty feet long, from the tip of the ſnout to the end of the tail: its
moſt uſual length, however, is eighteen. One which was diſſected by the
Jeſuits at Siam was of the latter dimenſions; and as the deſcription
which is given of it, both externally and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, is the moſt accurate
known of this noted animal, I muſt beg leave to give it as I find it, though
ſomewhat tedious. It was eighteen feet and an half, French meaſure, in
length; of which the tail was no leſs than five feet and an half, and the
head and neck above two feet and an half. It was four feet nine inches in
circumference, where thickeſt. The fore legs had the ſame parts and
conformation as the arms of a man, both within and without. The 
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0824000107:127"/> hands, if they may be ſo called, had five fingers; the
two laſt of which had no nails, and were of a conical figure. The hinder
legs, including the thigh and paw, were two feet two inches long; the paws,
from the joint to the extremity of the longeſt claws, were above nine inches:
they were divided into four toes, of which three were armed with large claws,
the longeſt of which was an inch and an half: theſe toes were united by a
membrane, like thoſe of a duck, but much thicker. The head was long, and had
a little riſing at the top; but the reſt was flat, and eſpecially towards
the extremity of the jaws. It was covered by a ſkin, which adhered firmly to
the ſkull and to the jaws. The ſkull was rough and unequal in ſeveral
places; and about the middle of the forehead there were two bony creſts,
about two inches high: the ſkull between theſe two creſts was proof
againſt a muſquet-ball; for it only rendered the part a little white that
it ſtruck againſt. The eye was very ſmall, in proportion to the reſt of
the body, and was ſo placed within its orbit, that the outward part, when the
lid was cloſed, was only an inch long, and the line running parallel to the
opening of the jaws. It was covered with a double lid, one within and one
without: that within, like the nictitating membrane in birds, was folded in the
great corner of the eye, and had <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0824000107:128"/> a motion towards the
tail, but being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, it covered the eye without hindering the
ſight. The iris was very large in proportion to the globe of the eye, and was
of a yellowiſh grey colour. Above the eye the ear was placed, which opened
from above downwards, as if it were by a kind of ſpring, by means of a
ſolid, thick, cartilaginous ſubſtance. The noſe was placed in the
middle of the upper jaw, near an inch from its extremity, and was perfectly
round and flat, being near two inches in diameter, of a black, ſoft, ſpongy
ſubſtance, not unlike the noſe of a dog. The jaws ſeemed to ſhut one
within another; and nothing can be more falſe than that the animal's under
jaw is without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it moves, like the lower jaw in all other animals,
while the upper is fixed to the ſkull and abſolutely immoveable. The animal
had twenty-ſeven cutting teeth in the upper jaw, and fifteen in the lower,
with ſeveral void ſpaces between them: they were thick at the bottom, and
ſharp at the point, being all of different ſizes, except ten large hooked
ones, ſix of which were in the lower jaw, and four in the upper. The mouth
was fifteen inches in length, and eight and an half in breadth, where
broadeſt. The diſtance of the two jaws, when opened as wide as they could
be, was fifteen inches and an half: this is a very wide yawn, and could
eaſily enough take in the <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0824000107:129"/> body of a man. The colour of
the body was of a dark brown on the upper part, and of a whitiſh citron
below, with large ſpots of both colours on the ſides. From the ſhoulders
to the extremity of the tail, the animal was covered with large ſcales, of a
ſquare form, diſpoſed like parallel girdles, and fifty-two in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
but thoſe near the tail were not ſo thick as the reſt. The creature was
covered not only with theſe, but all over with a coat of armour; which,
however, was not proof againſt a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-ball, contrary to what has been
commonly aſſerted: however, it muſt be confeſſed, that the attitude
in which the animal was placed, might contribute to render the ſkin more
penetrable; for probably if the ball had ſtruck obliquely againſt the
ſhell, it would have flown off. Thoſe parts of the girdles underneath the
belly were of a whitiſh colour, and were made up of ſcales of divers
ſhapes, but not ſo hard as thoſe on the back.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the internal parts of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, the gullet
was large in proportion to the mouth; and a ball of wood, as large as one's
head, readily ran down, and was drawn up again. The guts were but ſhort, in
compariſon, being not ſo long as the animal's body. The tongue, which
ſome have erroneouſly aſſerted <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0824000107:130"/> this animal was
without, conſiſted of a thick ſpongy ſoft fleſh, and was ſtrongly
connected to the lower jaw. The heart was of the ſize of a calf's, of a
bright red colour, the blood paſſing as well from the veins to the aorta as
into the lungs. There was no bladder; but the kidneys ſent the urine to be
diſcharged by the anus. There were ſixty-two joints in the back-bone,
which, though very cloſely united, had ſufficient play to enable the animal
to bend like a bow to the right and the left; ſo that what we hear of
eſcaping the creature by turning out of the right line, and of the animal's
not being able to wheel readily after its prey, ſeems to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous. It is
moſt likely the crocodile can turn with great eaſe, for the joints of its
back are not ſtiffer than thoſe of other animals which we know by
experience can wheel about very nimbly for their ſize.</p>
               <p>Such is the figure and conformation of this formidable animal,
that unpeoples countries, and makes the moſt navigable rivers deſart and
dangerous. They are ſeen, in ſome places, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for whole hours, and even
days, ſtretched in the ſun, and motionleſs; ſo that one not uſed to
them, might miſtake them for trunks of trees, covered with a rough and dry
bark; but the miſtake would ſoon be fatal, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0824000107:131"/> for the torpid animal, at the near approach of any
living thing, darts upon it with inſtant ſwiftneſs, and at once drags it
down to the bottom. In the times of an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, they ſometimes enter the
cottages of the natives, where the dreadful viſitant ſeizes the firſt
animal it meets with. There have been ſeveral examples of their taking a man
out of a canoe in the ſight of his companions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their being able to
lend him any aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength of every part of the crocodile is very great; and
its arms, both offenſive and defenſive, irreſiſtible. We have ſeen,
from the ſhortneſs of its legs, the amazing ſtrength of the tortoiſe:
but what is the ſtrength of ſuch an animal, compared to that of the
crocodile, whoſe legs are very ſhort and whoſe ſize is ſo ſuperior.
The back-bone is jointed in the firmeſt manner; the muſcles of the fore and
hinder legs are vigorous and ſtrong; and its whole form calculated for force.
Its teeth are ſharp, numerous and formidable; its claws are long and
tenaceous; but its principal inſtrument of deſtruction is the tail: with a
ſingle blow of this it has often overturned a canoe, and ſeized upon the
poor ſavage its conductor.</p>
               <p>Though not ſo powerful, yet it is very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible even upon
land. The crocodile ſeldom, <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0824000107:132"/> except when preſſed by
hunger, or with a view of depoſiting its eggs, leaves the water. Its uſual
method is to float along upon the ſurface and ſeize whatever animals come
within its reach; but when this method fails, it then goes cloſer to the
bank. Diſappointed of its fiſhy prey, it there waits covered up among the
ſedges, in patient expectation of ſome land animal that comes to drink; the
dog, the bull, the tiger, or man himſelf. Nothing is to be ſeen of the
inſiduous deſtroyer as the animal approaches; nor is its retreat
diſcovered till it be too late for ſafety. It ſeizes the victim with a
ſpring, and goes at a bound much faſter than ſo unwieldy an animal could
be thought capable of exerting; then having ſecured the creature with both
teeth and claws, it drags it into the water, inſtantly ſinks with it to the
bottom, and in this manner quickly drowns it.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it happens that the creature the crocodile has thus
ſurprized eſcapes from its graſp wounded, and makes off from the
river<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. In ſuch a caſe, the tyrant purſues with all its force, and
often ſeizes it a ſecond time; for though ſeemingly heavy, the crocodile
runs with great celerity. In this manner it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen above half a
mile from the bank, in <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0824000107:133"/> purſuit of an animal wounded
beyond the power of eſcaping, and then dragging it back to the river-ſide,
where it feaſts in ſecurity.</p>
               <p>It often happens, in its depredations along the bank, that the
crododile ſeizes on a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as formidable as itſelf, and meets with a
moſt deſperate reſiſtance. We are told of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent combats between the
crocodile and the tiger. All creatures of the tiger kind are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
oppreſſed by a parching thirſt that keeps them in the vicinity of great
rivers, whither they deſcend to drink very frequently. It is upon theſe
occaſions that they are ſeized by the crocodile; and they die not
unrevenged. The inſtant they are ſeized upon, they turn with the greateſt
agility, and force their claws into the crocodile's eyes, while he plunges with
his fierce antagoniſt into the river. There they continue to ſtruggle for
ſome time, till at laſt the tiger is drowned.</p>
               <p>In this manner the crocodile ſeizes and deſtroys all
animals, and is equally dreaded by all. There is no animal but man alone that
can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat it with ſucceſs. We are aſſured by Labat, that a Negro,
with no other weapons than a knife in his right hand, and his left arm wrapped
round with a cow hide, ventures boldly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack this animal in its own
element. As ſoon <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0824000107:134"/> as he approaches the crocodile, he
preſents his left arm, which the animal ſwallows moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily; but
ſticking in its throat, the Negro has time to give it ſeveral ſtabs under
the throat; and the water alſo getting in it at the mouth, which is held
involuntarily open, the creature is ſoon bloated up as big as a tun, and
expires.</p>
               <p>To us who live at a diſtance from the rapacity of theſe
animals, theſe ſtories appear ſtrange, and yet moſt probably are true.
From not having ſeen any thing ſo formidable or bold in the circle of our
own experience, we are not to determine upon the wonderful tranſactions in
diſtant climates. It is probable that theſe, and a number of more dreadful
encounters, happen every day among thoſe foreſts and in thoſe rivers
where the moſt formidable animals are known to reſide; where the elephant
and the rhinoceros, the tiger and the hipopotamos, the ſhark and the
crocodile, have frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of meeting, and every day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
their engagements.</p>
               <p>Whatever be the truth of theſe accounts, certain it is that
crocodiles are taken by the Siameſe in great abundance. The natives of that
empire ſeem particularly fond of the capture of all the great animals with
which their country abounds. We have already ſeen their ſucceſs 
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0824000107:135"/> in taking and taming the elephant; nor are they leſs
powerful in exerting their dominion over the crocodile. The manner of taking it
in Siam is by throwing three or four ſtrong nets acroſs a river, at proper
diſtances from each other; ſo that if the animal breaks through the
firſt, it may be caught by one of the reſt. When it is firſt taken, it
employs the tail, which is the grand inſtrument of ſtrength, with great
force; but after many unſucceſsful ſtruggles, the animal's ſtrength is
at laſt exhauſted. Then the natives approach their priſoner in boats, and
pierce him with their weapons in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> tender parts till he is
weakened with the loſs of blood. When he has done ſtirring, they begin by
tying up his mouth, and with the ſame cord they faſten his head to his
tail, which laſt they bend back like a bow. However, they are not yet
perfectly ſecure from his fury; but, for their greater ſafety, they tie his
fore feet as well as thoſe behind to the top of his back. Theſe precautions
are not uſeleſs; for if they were to omit them, the crocodile would ſoon
recover ſtrength enough to do a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
               <p>The crocodile thus brought into ſubjection, or bred up young,
is uſed to divert and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the great men of the eaſt. It is often 
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0824000107:136"/> managed like an horſe; a curb is put into its mouth,
and the rider directs it as he thinks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Though aukwardly formed, it does
not fail to proceed with ſome degree of ſwiftneſs; and is thought to move
as faſt as ſome of the moſt unwieldy of our own animals, the hog or the
cow. Some, indeed, aſſert that no animal could eſcape it, but for its
difficulty in turning; but to this reſource we could wiſh none would
truſt who are ſo unhappy as to find themſelves in danger.</p>
               <p>Along the rivers of Africa this animal is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken in
the ſame manner as the ſhark. Several Europeans go together in a large
boat, and throw out a piece of beef upon a hook and ſtrong fortified line,
which the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile ſeizing and ſwallowing, is drawn along, floundering
and ſtruggling until its ſtrength is quite exhauſted, when it is pierced
in the belly, which is its tendereſt part; and thus after num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs
wounds is drawn aſhore. In this part of the world alſo, as well as at Siam,
the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile makes an object of ſavage pomp near the palaces of their
monarchs. Philips informs us that at Sabi, on the ſlave coaſt, there are
two pools of water near the royal palace, where cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles are bred as we
breed carp in our ponds in Europe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0824000107:137"/>Hitherto I have been deſcribing the
crocodile as it is found in unpeopled countries, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed by frequent
encounters with mankind. In this ſtate it is fierce and cruel, attacking
every object that ſeems endued with motion: but in Egypt, and other countries
long peopled, where the inhabitants are civilized and the rivers fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented,
this animal is ſolitary and fearful. So far from coming to attack a man, it
ſinks at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with the utmoſt precipitation; and, as if
ſenſible of ſuperior power, ever declines the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. We have ſeen
more than one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in animated nature of the contempt which at firſt
the lower orders of the creation have for man, till they have experienced his
powers of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The lion and the tiger among beaſts, the whale
among fiſhes, the albatroſs and the penguin among birds, meet the firſt
encounters of man without dread or apprehenſion; but they ſoon learn to
acknowledge his ſuperiority; and take refuge from his power in the deepeſt
faſtneſſes of nature. This may account for the different characters which
have been given us of the crocodile and the alligator by travellers at
different times: ſome deſcribing them as harmleſs and fearful, as ever
avoiding the ſight of a man, and preying only upon fiſhes; others ranking
them among the deſtroyers of <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0824000107:138"/> nature; deſcribing them
as furniſhed with ſtrength and impelled by malignity to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
repreſenting them as the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of mankind, and particularly
deſirous of human prey. The truth is, the animal has been juſtly
deſcribed by both; being ſuch as it is found in places differently peopled
or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently civilized. Wherever the crocodile has reigned long
unmoleſted, it is there fierce, bold, and dangerous; wherever it has been
harraſſed by mankind, its retreats invaded, and its numbers deſtroyed, it
is there timorous and inoffenſive.</p>
               <p>In ſome places, therefore, this animal, inſtead of being
formidable, is not only inoffenſive, but is cheriſhed and admired. In the
river San Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo, the crocodiles are the moſt inoffenſive animals in
nature; the children play with them, and ride about on their backs; they even
beat them ſometimes without receiving the ſmalleſt injury. It is true the
inhabitants are very careful of this gentle breed, and conſider them as
harmleſs domeſtics.</p>
               <p>It is probable that the ſmell of muſk, which all theſe
animals exhale, may render them agreeable to the ſavages of that part of
Africa. They are often known to take the part of this animal which contains the
muſk and wear it as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0824000107:139"/> about their perſons.
Travellers are not agreed in what part of the body theſe muſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bags are
contained; ſome ſay in the ears; ſome, in the parts of generation; but
the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion is, that this muſky ſubſtance is amaſſed
in glands under the legs and arms. From whatſoever part of the body this
odour proceeds, it is very ſtrong and powerful, tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing the fleſh of
the whole body with its taſte and ſmell. The crocodile's fleſh is at
beſt very bad tough eating; but unleſs the muſk-bags be ſeparated it is
inſupportable. The Negroes themſelves cannot well digeſt the fleſh; but
then, a crocodile's egg is to them the moſt delicate morſel in the world.
Even ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages exhibit their epicures as well as we; and one of true taſte
will ſpare neither pains nor danger to furniſh himſelf with his favourite
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt. For this reaſon, he often watches the places where the female
comes to lay her eggs, and upon her retiring ſeizes the booty.</p>
               <p>All crocodiles breed near freſh waters; and though they are
ſometimes found in the ſea, yet that may be conſidered rather as a place
of excurſion than abode. They produce their young by eggs, as was ſaid
above; and for this purpoſe the female when ſhe comes to lay, chooſes a
place by the ſide of a river, or ſome <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0824000107:140"/> freſh water
lake, to depoſit her brood in. She always pitches upon an extenſive ſandy
ſhore, where ſhe may dig a hole without danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the
ground being freſh turned up. The ſhore muſt alſo be gentle and
ſhelving to the water, for the greater convenience of the animal's going and
returning; and a convenient place muſt be found near the edge of the
ſtream, that the young may have a ſhorter way to go. When all theſe
requiſites are adjuſted, the animal is ſeen cautiouſly ſtealing up on
ſhore to depoſit her burthen. The preſence of a man, a beaſt, or even a
bird, is ſufficient to deter her at that time; and if ſhe perceives any
creature looking on, ſhe infallibly returns. If, however, nothing appears,
ſhe then goes to work, ſcratching up the ſand with her fore paws, and
making a hole pretty deep in the ſhore. There ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſits from eighty
to an hundred eggs, of the ſize of a tennis-ball, and of the ſame figure,
covered with a tough white ſkin like parchment. She takes above an hour to
perform this taſk; and then covering up the place ſo artfully that it can
ſcarcely be perceived, ſhe goes back to return again the next day. Upon her
return, with the ſame precaution as before, ſhe lays about the ſame
number of eggs; and the day following alſo a like number. Thus having 
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0824000107:141"/> depoſited her whole quantity, and having co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them
cloſe up in the ſand, they are ſoon vivified by the heat of the ſun;
and at the end of thirty days, the young ones begin to break open the ſhell.
At this time the female is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctively taught that her young ones want
relief; and ſhe goes up on land to ſcratch away the ſand and ſet them
free. Her brood quickly avail themſelves of their liberty; a part run
unguided to the water; another part aſcend the back of the female, and are
carried thither in greater ſafety. But the moment they arrive at the water,
all natural connexion is at an end: when the female has introduced her young to
their natural element, not only ſhe, but the male, become among the number of
their moſt formidable enemies, and devour as many of them as they can. The
whole brood ſcatters into different parts at the bottom; by far the
greateſt number are deſtroyed; and the reſt find ſafety in their
agility or minuteneſs.</p>
               <p>But it is not the crocodile alone that is thus found to thin
their numbers; the eggs of this animal are not only a delicious feaſt to the
ſavage, but are eagerly ſought after by every beaſt and bird of prey. The
ichneumon was erected into a deity among the ancients for its ſucceſs in
deſtroying the eggs of theſe monſters: <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0824000107:142"/> at
preſent that ſpecies of the vulture called the Gallinazo is their moſt
prevailing enemy. All along the banks of great rivers, for thouſands of
miles, the crocodile is ſeen to propagate in numbers that would ſoon
over-run the earth, but for the vulture, that ſeems appointed by Providence
to abridge its fecundity. Theſe birds are ever found in greateſt numbers
where the crocodile is moſt numerous; and hiding themſelves within the
thick branches of the trees that ſhade the banks of the river, they watch the
female in ſilence, and permit her to lay all her eggs without interruption.
Then when ſhe has retired, they encourage each other with cries to the
ſpoil; and flocking all together upon the hidden treaſure, tear up the
eggs, and devour them in a much quicker time than they were depoſited. Nor
are they leſs diligent in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the female while ſhe is carrying her
young to the water; for if any one of them happens to drop by the way, it is
ſure to receive no mercy.</p>
               <p>Such is the extraordinary account given us by late travellers of
the propagation of this animal; an account adopted by Linnaeus and the moſt
learned naturaliſts of the age<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Ulloa.</bibl>
                  </note>. Yet, if one might argue from the
general analogy <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0824000107:143"/> of nature, the crocodile's devouring her
own young when ſhe gets to the water ſeems doubtful. This may be a ſtory
raiſed from the general idea of this animal's rapacious cruelty; when, in
fact, the crocodile only ſeems more cruel than other animals becauſe it has
more power to do miſchief. It is probable that it is not more diveſted of
parental tenderneſs than other creatures; and I am the more led to think ſo
from the peculiar formation of one of the crocodile kind. This is called the
Open Bellied Crocodile, and is furniſhed with a falſe belly like the
opoſſum, where the young creep out and in as their dangers or
neceſſities require. The crocodile thus furniſhed at leaſt cannot be
ſaid to be an enemy to her own young, ſince ſhe thus gives them more than
parental protection. It is probable alſo that this Open Bellied Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile is
viviparous, and foſters her young that are prematurely excluded in this
ſecond womb, until they come to proper maturity.</p>
               <p>How long the crocodile lives we are not certainly informed; if
we may believe Ariſtotle, it lives the age of a man; but the ancients ſo
much amuſed themſelves in inventing fables concerning this animal, that
even truth from them is ſuſpicious. What we know for certain from the
ancients is, that among the various <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0824000107:144"/> animals that were
produced to fight in the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre at Rome, the combat of the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile
was not wanting<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Salamander.</head>
               <p>THE ancients have deſcribed a lizard that is bred from heat,
that lives in the flames, and feeds upon fire as its proper nouriſhment. As
they ſaw every other element, the air, the earth and water, inhabited, fancy
was ſet to work to find or make an inhabitant in fire; and thus to people
every part of nature. It will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to ſay that there is no ſuch
animal exiſting; and that, of all others, the modern Salamander has the
ſmalleſt affinity to ſuch an abode.</p>
               <p>Whether the animal that now goes by the name of the ſalamander
be the ſame with that deſcribed by Pliny, is a doubt with me; but this is
not a place for the diſcuſſion. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to obſerve, that
the modern ſalamander is an animal of the lizard kind, and under this name is
comprehended a large tribe that all go by the ſame name. There have been not
leſs than ſeven ſorts of this animal deſcribed by Seba; and to have
ſome idea of the peculiarity of their figure, if we ſuppoſe the tail of a
lizard applied to the body of a frog, we ſhall not be far from preciſion.
The common lizard is long, ſmall <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0824000107:146"/> and taper; the
ſalamander, like the frog, has its eyes towards the back of the head; like
the frog, its ſnout is round and not pointed, and its belly thick and
ſwolen. The claws of its toes are ſhort and feeble; its ſkin rough; and
the tongue, unlike that of the ſmalleſt of the lizard kind, in which it is
long and forked, is ſhort, and adhering to the under jaw.</p>
               <p>But it is not in figure that this animal chiefly differs from
the reſt of the lizard tribe; for it ſeems to differ in nature and
conformation. In nature it is unlike, being an heavy, torpid ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; whereas
the lizard tribe are active, reſtleſs, and ever in motion: in conformation
it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as the ſalamander is produced alive from the body of its
parent, and is completely formed the moment of its excluſion. It differs from
them alſo in its general reputation of being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous; however, no trials
that have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto made ſeem to confirm the truth of the report.</p>
               <p>Not only this, but many others of the lizard tribe are ſaid to
have venom; but it were to be wiſhed that mankind, for their own happineſs,
would examine into the foundation of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. By that means many of
them, that are now ſhunned and deteſted, might be found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive;
their figure, inſtead of exciting either <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0824000107:147"/> horror or
diſguſt, would then only tend to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the general ſcene of nature;
and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation might examine their manners in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and ſecurity.
Certain it is, that all of the lizard kind with which we are acquainted in this
country, are perfectly harmleſs; and it is equally true that, for a long
time, till our prejudices were removed, we conſidered not only the Newt, but
the Snake and the Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, as fraught with the moſt deſtructive
poiſon. At preſent we have got over theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices; and, it is
probable, that, if other nations made the ſame efforts for information, it
would be found, that the malignity of moſt, if not all, of the lizard tribe,
was only in the imagination.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the Salamander, the whole tribe, from the
Moron to the Gekko, are ſaid to be venomous to the laſt degree; yet, when
experiments have been tried, no arts, no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, could excite theſe
animals to the rage of biting. They ſeem timid and inoffenſive, only living
upon worms and inſects; quite deſtitute of fangs, like the viper; their
teeth are ſo very ſmall, that they are hardly able to inflict a wound. But
as the teeth are thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of offending, the people of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
where they are found have recourſe to a venomous ſlaver, which, they
ſuppoſe, iſſues <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0824000107:148"/> from the animal's mouth; they
alſo tell us of a venom iſſuing from the claws: even Linnaeus ſeems to
acknowledge the fact; but thinks it a probable ſuppoſition that this venom
may proceed from their urine.</p>
               <p>Of all animals, the Gekko is the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious for its
powers of miſchief: yet, we are told by thoſe who load it with that
calumny, that it is very friendly to man, and though ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the
moſt deadly virulence, is yet never known to bite. It would be abſurd in
us, without experience, to pronounce upon the noxious or inoffenſive
qualities of animals: yet it is moſt probable, from an inſpection of the
teeth of lizards, and from their inoffenſive qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in Europe, that the
gekko has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly accuſed; and that its ſerpent-like figure has
involved it in one common reproach with ſerpents.</p>
               <p>The ſalamander beſt known in Europe, is from eight to eleven
inches long, uſually black, ſpotted with yellow; and when taken in the
hand, feeling cold to a great degree. There are ſeveral kinds. Our Black
Water Newt is reckoned among the number. The idle report of its being
inconſumable in fire, has cauſed many of theſe poor animals to be burnt;
but we cannot ſay as philoſophical martyrs; ſince ſcarce any 
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0824000107:149"/> philoſopher could think it neceſſary to make the
experiment. When thrown into the fire, the animal is ſeen to burſt with the
heat of its ſituation, and to eject its fluids. We are gravely told, in the
Philoſophical Tranſactions, that this is a method the animal takes to
extinguiſh the flames.</p>
               <p>When examined internally, the ſalamander exhibits little
different from other animals of the lizard kind. It is furniſhed with lungs
that ſometimes ſerve for the offices of breathing; with a heart that has
its communications open, ſo that the animal cannot eaſily be drowned. The
ovary in the female is double the ſize of what it is in others of this tribe;
and the male is furniſhed with four teſticuli inſtead of two. But what
deſerves particular notice is the manner of this animal's bringing forth its

<q rend="inline">"The ſalamander," ſays my author, "begins to
ſhew itſelf in ſpring, and chiefly during heavy rains. When the warm
weather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, it diſappears; and never leaves its hole, during either
great heats or ſevere colds, both which it equally fears. When taken in the
hand, it appears like a lump of ice; it conſequently loves the ſhade, and
is found <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0824000107:150"/> at the feet of old trees ſurrounded with
bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood at the bottom. It is fond of running along new plowed grounds;
probably to ſeek for worms, which are its ordinary food. One of theſe,"
continues my author, "I took alive ſome years ago in a ditch that had been
lately made. I laid it at the foot of the ſtairs upon coming home, and there
it diſgorged from the throat a <hi>worm</hi> three inches long, that lived
for an hour after, though wounded as I ſuppoſe by the teeth of the animal.
I afterwards cut up another of theſe lizards, and ſaw not leſs than fifty
young ones, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the parent, come from its womb, all alive, and
actively running about the room."</q> It were to be wiſhed the author had
uſed another word beſide that of <hi>worm</hi>; as we now are in doubt
whether he means a real worm, or a young animal of the lizard ſpecies: had he
been more explicit, and had it appeared that it was a real young lizard, which
I take to be his meaning, we might here ſee a wonder of Nature, brought to
the proof which many have aſſerted, and many have thought proper to
deny:—I mean the refuge which the young of the ſhark, the lizard, and
the viper kinds, are ſaid to take, by running down the throat of the parent,
and there finding a temporary ſecurity. <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0824000107:151"/> The fact
indeed, ſeems a little extraordinary; and yet it is ſo frequently
atteſted by ſome, and even believed by others, whoſe authority is
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable, among the number of whom we find Mr. Penant, that the argument
of ſtrangeneſs muſt give way to the weight of authority.</p>
               <p>However this be, there is no doubt of the animal's being
viviparous, and producing above fifty at a time. They come from the parent in
full perfection, and quickly leave her to ſhift for themſelves. Theſe
animals, in the lower ranks of nature, want ſcarce any help when excluded;
they ſoon complete the little circle of their education; and in a day or two
are capable of practiſing all the arts of ſubſiſtence and evaſion
practiſed by their kind.</p>
               <p>They are all amphibious, or at leaſt are found capable of
ſubſiſting in either element, when placed there: if thoſe taken from
land are put into water, they continue there in ſeeming health; and, on the
contrary, thoſe taken from the water will live upon land. In water, however,
they exhibit a greater variety in their appearance; and what is equally
won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful with the reſt of their hiſtory, during the whole ſpring and
ſummer this water lizard changes its ſkin every fourth or fifth day; and
during the winter every fifteen days. This <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0824000107:152"/> operation
they perform by means of the mouth and the claws; and it ſeems a work of no
ſmall difficulty and pain. The caſt ſkins are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen floating
on the ſurface of the water: they are ſometimes ſeen alſo with a part
of their old ſkin ſtill ſticking to one of their limbs, which they have
not been able to get rid of; and thus, like a man with a boot half drawn, in
ſome meaſure crippled in their own ſpoils. This alſo often corrupts,
and the leg drops off; but the animal does not ſeem to feel the want of it,
for the loſs of a limb to all the lizard kind is but a trifling calamity.
They can live ſeveral hours even after the loſs of their head: and for
ſome time under diſſection, all the parts of this animal ſeem to retain
life: but the tail is the part that longeſt retains its motion. Salt ſeems
to be much more efficacious in deſtroying theſe animals, than the knife;
for, upon being ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it, the whole body emits a viſcous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
and the lizard dies in three minutes, in great agonies.</p>
               <p>The whole of the lizard kind are alſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious of life in
another reſpect, and the ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander among the number. They ſuſtain the
want of food in a ſurprizing manner. One of them, brought from the Indies,
lived nine months, without any other food than what it <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0824000107:153"/>
received from licking a piece of earth on which it was brought over<note n="*" place="bottom">

another was kept by Seba in an empty vial for ſix months, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any
nouriſhment; and Redi talks of a large one, brought from Africa, that lived
for eight months, without taking any nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatever. Indeed, as many
of this kind, both ſalamanders and lizards, are torpid, or nearly ſo,
during the winter, the loſs of their appetite for ſo long a time is the
leſs ſurprizing.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Cameleon, the Iguana, and Lizards of
different Kinds.</head>
               <p>IT were to be wiſhed that animals could be ſo claſſed,
that by the very mentioning their rank, we ſhould receive ſome inſight
into their hiſtory. This I have endeavoured in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but in
the preſent chapter all method is totally unſerviceable. Here
diſtribution gives no general ideas: for ſome of the animals to be here
mentioned produce by eggs; ſome by ſpawn; and ſome are viviparous. The
peculiar manner of propagating in each, is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctly known. The
Iguana and the Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, we know bring forth eggs; ſome others alſo
produce in the ſame manner: but of the reſt, which naturaliſts make
amount to above fifty, we have but very indiſtinct information.</p>
               <p>In the former diviſions of this tribe, we had to obſerve
upon animals, formidable from their ſize, or diſguſting from their
frog-like head and appearance; in the preſent diviſion, all the animals are
either beautiful to the eye, or grateful to the appetite. The lizards, properly
ſo called, are beautifully painted and mottled; <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0824000107:155"/> their
frolicſome agility is amuſing to thoſe who are familiar with their
appearance; and the great affection which ſome of them ſhew to man,
ſhould, in ſome meaſure, be repaid with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Others, ſuch as
the Iguana, though not poſſeſſed of beauty, are very ſerviceable,
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing one of the moſt luxurious feaſts the tropical climates can
boaſt of. Thoſe treated of before were objects of curioſity, becauſe
they were apparently objects of danger: moſt of thoſe here mentioned have
either uſe or beauty to engage us.</p>
               <p>Directly deſcending from the crocodile, we find the Cordyle,
the Tockay and the Teju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guacu, all growing leſs in order, as I have named
them. Theſe fill up the chaſm to be found between the crocodile and the
African iguana.</p>
               <p>The Iguana, which deſerves our notice, is about five feet
long, and the body about as thick as one's thigh: the ſkin is covered with
ſmall ſcales, like thoſe of a ſerpent; and the back is furniſhed with
a row of prickles, that ſtand up, like the teeth of a ſaw: the eyes ſeem
to be but half opened, except when the animal is angry, and then they appear
large and ſparkling: both the jaws are full of very ſharp teeth, and the
bite is dangerous though <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0824000107:156"/> not venomous, for it never lets
looſe till it is killed. The male has a ſkin hanging under his throat,
which reaches down to his breaſt; and, when diſpleaſed, he puffs it up
like a bladder: he is one third larger and ſtronger than the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; though
the ſtrength of either avails them little towards their defence. The males
are aſh-coloured, and the females are green.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of theſe may be conſidered as the greateſt
delicacy of Africa and America; and the ſportſmen of thoſe climates go
out to hunt the iguana, as we do in purſuit of the pheaſant or the hare. In
the beginning of the ſeaſon, when the great floods of the tropical climates
are paſt away, and vegetation ſtarts into uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal verdure, the
ſportſmen are ſeen, with a nooze and a ſtick, wandering along the
ſides of the rivers, to take the iguana. This animal, though apparently
formed for combat, is the moſt harmleſs creature of all the foreſt; it
lives among the trees, or ſports in the water, without ever offering to
offend: there, having fed upon the flowers of the mahot, and the leaves of the
mapou, that grow along the banks of the ſtream, it goes to repoſe upon the
branches of the trees that hang over the water. Upon land the animal is ſwift
of foot; but when once in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a tree, it ſeems conſcious
of the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0824000107:157"/> of its ſituation, and never offers
to ſtir. There the ſportſman eaſily finds it, and as eaſily faſtens
his nooze round its neck: if the head be placed in ſuch a manner that the
nooze cannot readily be faſtened, by hitting the animal a blow on the noſe
with the ſtick, it lifts the head, and offers it in ſome meaſure to the
nooze. In this manner, and alſo by the tail, the iguana is dragged from the
trees, and killed by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blows on the head.</p>
               <p>The Cameleon is a very different animal; and as the iguana
ſatisfies the appetites of the epicure, this is rather the feaſt of the
philoſopher. Like the crocodile, this little animal proceeds from an egg; and
it alſo nearly reſembles that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable creature in form: but it differs
widely in its ſize and its appetites; being not above eleven inches long, and
delighting to ſit upon trees, being afraid of ſerpents, from which it is
unable to eſcape on the ground.</p>
               <p>The head of a large cameleon is almoſt two inches long; and
from thence to the beginning of the tail, four and an half: the tail is five
inches long, and the feet two and an half: the thickneſs of the body is
different at different times; for ſometimes, from the back to the belly, it
is two inches, and ſometimes but one; for it can blow itſelf up, and
contract itſelf, at <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0824000107:158"/> pleaſure. This ſwelling and
contraction is not only of the back and belly, but of the legs and tail.</p>
               <p>Theſe different tumours do not proceed from a dilatation of
the breaſt in breathing, which riſes and falls by turns; but are very
irregular, and ſeem adopted merely from caprice. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleon is often
ſeen, as it were, blown up for two hours together; and then it continues
growing leſs and leſs inſenſibly; for the dilatation is always more
quick and viſible than the contraction. In this laſt ſtate the animal
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears extremely lean; the ſpine of the back ſeems ſharp, and all the
ribs may be counted; likewiſe the tendons of the legs and arms may be ſeen
very diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>This method of puffing itſelf up, is ſimilar to that in
pigeons, whoſe crops are ſometimes greatly diſtended with air. The
cameleon has a power of driving the air it breathes over every part of the
body: however, it only gets between the ſkin and the muſcles; for the
muſcles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are never ſwolen. The ſkin is very cold to the
touch; and though the animal ſeems ſo lean, there is no feeling the beating
of the heart. The ſurface of the ſkin is unequal, and has a grain not
unlike ſhagreen, but very ſoft, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe each eminence is as ſmooth as
if it were <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0824000107:159"/> poliſhed. Some of theſe little
protuberances are as large as a pin's head, on the arms, legs, belly and tail;
but on the ſhoulders and head they are of an oval figure, and a little
larger: thoſe under the throat are ranged in the form of a chaplet, from the
lower lip to the breaſt. The colour of all theſe eminences, when the
cameleon is at reſt in a ſhady place, is of a bluiſh grey, and the
ſpaces between is of a pale red and yellow.</p>
               <p>But when the animal is removed into the ſun, then comes the
wonderful part of its hiſtory. At firſt it appears to ſuffer no change of
colour, its greyiſh ſpots ſtill continuing the ſame: but the whole
ſurface ſoon ſeems to imbibe the rays of light; and the ſimple
colouring of the body changes into a variety of beautiful hues. Wherever the
light comes upon the body, it is of a tawny brown; but that part of the ſkin
on which the ſun does not ſhine, changes into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral brighter colours,
pale yellow, or vivid crimſon; which form ſpots of the ſize of half one's
finger: ſome of theſe deſcend from the ſpine half way down the back;
and others appear on the ſides, arms and tail. When the ſun has done
ſhining, the original grey colour returns by degrees, and covers all the
body. Sometimes the animal becomes all over <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0824000107:160"/> ſpotted
with brown ſpots, of a greeniſh caſt. When it is wrapped up in a white
linen cloth for two or three minutes, the natural colour becomes much lighter;
but not quite white, as ſome authors have pretended: however, from hence it
muſt not be concluded that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleon aſſumes the colour of the
objects which it approaches; this is entirely an error, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably has taken
its riſe from the continual changes it appears to undergo.</p>
               <p>Le Bruyn, in his Voyage to the Levant, has given us a very ample
deſcription of the came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon. During his ſtay at Smyrna, he bought
ſeveral of this kind, and, to try how long they could live, kept four of them
in a cage, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them at times to run about the houſe. The freſh
ſea-breeze ſeemed to give them moſt ſpirits and vivacity; they opened
their mouths to take it in: he never perceived that they eat any thing, except
now and then a fly, which they took half an hour to ſwallow: he obſerved
their colour often to change, three or four times ſucceſſively, without
being able to find out any cauſe for ſuch alterations: their common colour
he found to be grey, or rather a pale mouſe colour; but its moſt frequent
changes were into a beautiful green, ſpotted with yellow: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the
animal was marked all over with dark <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0824000107:161"/> brown; and this
often changed into a lighter brown: ſome colours, however, it never
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; and, contrary to what was ſaid above, he found red to be among
the number.</p>
               <p>Though our traveller took the utmoſt care, he was unable to
preſerve any of them alive above five months; and many of them died in four.
When the cameleon changes place, and attempts to deſcend from an eminence, it
moves with the utmoſt precaution, advancing one leg very deliberately before
the other, ſtill ſecuring itſelf by holding whatever it can graſp by
the tail. It ſeldom opens the mouth, except for freſh air; and when that is
ſupplied, diſcovers its ſatisfaction by its motions, and the frequent
changes of its colour. The tongue is ſometimes darted out after its prey,
which is flies; and this is as long as the whole body. The eyes are remarkably
little, though they ſtand out of the head: they have a ſingle eye-lid, like
a cap with a hole in the middle, through which the ſight of the eye appears,
which is of a ſhining brown; and round it there is a little circle of a gold
colour: but the moſt extraordinary part of their conformation is, that the
animal often moves one eye, when the other is entirely at reſt; nay,
ſometimes one eye will ſeem to look directly forward, while the other looks
back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0824000107:162"/> and one will look upwards, while the other
regards the earth.</p>
               <p>To this claſs of lizards, we may refer the Dragon, a moſt
terrible animal, but moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not of Nature's formation. Of this
death-dealing creature all people have read; and the moſt barbarous
countries, to this day, paint it to the imagination in all its terrors, and
fear to meet it in every foreſt. It is not enough that Nature has furniſhed
thoſe countries with poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of various malignity; with ſerpents forty
feet long; with elephants, lions and tigers, to make their ſituation really
dangerous; the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious imagination is ſet at work to call up new terrors;
and ſcarce a ſavage is found, that does not talk of winged ſerpents of
immoderate length, flying away with the camel or the rhino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceros, or
deſtroying mankind by a ſingle glare. Happily, however, ſuch ravagers are
no where found to exiſt at preſent; and the whole race of dragons is
dwindled down to the Flying Lizard, a little harmleſs creature, that only
preys upon inſects, and even ſeems to embelliſh the foreſt with its
beauty.</p>
               <p>The Flying Lizard of Java perches upon fruit-trees, and feeds
upon flies, ants, but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflies, and other ſmall inſects. It is a very
harmleſs creature, and does no miſchief in <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0824000107:163"/> any
reſpect. Gentil, in his Voyage round the World, affirms, that he has ſeen
theſe lizards, at the iſland of Java, in the Eaſt Indies. He obſerved
they flew very ſwiftly from tree to tree; and having killed one, he could not
but admire the ſkin, which was painted with ſeveral beautiful colours: it
was a foot in length, and had four paws, like the common lizards; but its head
was flat, and had a ſmall hole in the middle; the wings were very thin, and
reſembled thoſe of a flying fiſh. About the neck were a ſort of
wattles, not unlike thoſe of cocks, which gave it no diſagreeable
appearance. He intended to have preſerved it, in order to bring it into
Europe; but it was corrupted by the heat, before the cloſe of the day:
however, they have ſince been brought into England, and are now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enough in the cabinets of the curious.</p>
               <p>The laſt animal of the lizard kind that I ſhall mention, is
the Chalcidian Lizard of Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus, very improperly called the Seps, by
modern hiſtorians. This animal ſeems to make the ſhade that ſeparates
the lizard from the ſerpent race. It has four legs, like the lizard; but ſo
ſhort, as to be utterly unſerviceable in walking: it has a long ſlender
body, like the ſerpent; and it is ſaid to have the ſerpent's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
alſo. The fore legs are very near the <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0824000107:164"/> head; the hind
legs are placed far backward; but before and behind they ſeem rather
uſeleſs incumbrances, than inſtruments ſerving to aſſiſt the
animal in its motions, or in providing for its ſubſiſtence. Theſe
animals are found above three feet long, and thick in proportion, with a large
head and pointed ſnout. The whole body is covered with ſcales; and the
belly is white, mixed with blue. It has four crooked teeth; as alſo a pointed
tail, which, however, can inflict no wound. Whether the teeth be ſimilar to
the viper's fangs, we are not told; though Volateranus ſays, they are covered
with a membrane; by which I am apt to think he means a venom-bag, which is
found at the root of the teeth of all ſerpents that are poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous. It is
viviparous; fifteen young ones having been taken alive out of its belly. Upon
the whole, it appears to bear a ſtrong affinity to the viper; and, like that
animal, its bite may be dangerous.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of Serpents in General.</head>
               <p>WE now come to a tribe that not only their deformity, their
venom, their ready malignity, but alſo our prejudices, and our very religion,
have taught us to deteſt. The ſerpent has from the beginning been the enemy
of man; and it has hitherto continued to terrify and annoy him,
notwithſtanding all the arts which have been practiſed to deſtroy it.
Formidable in itſelf, it deters the invader from the purſuit; and from its
figure capable of finding ſhelter in a little ſpace, it is not eaſily
diſcovered by thoſe who would venture to try the encounter. Thus
poſſeſſed at once of potent arms and inacceſſible or ſecure
retreats, it baffles all the arts of man though never ſo earneſtly bent
upon its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon, there is ſcarce a country in the world that
does not ſtill give birth to this poiſonous brood, that ſeem formed to
quell human pride, and repreſs the boaſts of ſecurity. Mankind have
driven the lion, the tiger and the wolf from their vicinity; but the ſnake
and the viper ſtill defy their power, and frequently puniſh their
inſolence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0824000107:166"/>Their numbers, however, are thinned by
human aſſiduity; and it is poſſible ſome of the kinds are wholly
deſtroyed. In none of the countries of Europe are they ſufficiently
nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be truly terrible; the philoſopher can meditate in the fields
without danger, and the lover ſeek the grove without fearing any wounds but
thoſe of metaphor. The various malignity that has been aſcribed to European
ſerpents of old, is now utterly unknown; there are not above three or four
kinds that are dangerous, and their poiſon operates in all in the ſame
manner. A burning pain in the part, eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable by timely applications,
is the worſt effect that we experience from the bite of the moſt venomous
ſerpents of Europe. The drowſy death, the ſtarting of the blood from
every pore, the inſatiable and burning thirſt, the melting down the ſolid
maſs of the whole form into one heap of putrefaction, theſe are horrors
with which we are entirely unacquainted.</p>
               <p>But though we have thus reduced theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, having been
incapable of wholly remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, in other parts of the world they ſtill
rage with all their ancient malignity. Nature ſeems to have placed them as
centinels to deter mankind from ſpreading too widely, and from ſeeking new
abodes till they have thoroughly <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0824000107:167"/> cultivated thoſe at
home. In the warm coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that lie within the tropic, as well as in the cold
regions of the north, where the inhabitants are few, the ſerpents propagate
in equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. But of all countries, thoſe regions have them in the
greateſt abundance where the fields are unpeopled and fertile, and where the
climate ſupplies warmth and humidity. All along the ſwampy banks of the
river Niger or Oroonoko, where the ſun is hot, the foreſts thick, and the
men but few, the ſerpents cling among the branches of the trees in infinite
num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and carry on an unceaſing war againſt all other animals in their
vicinity. Travellers have aſſured us that they have often ſeen large
ſnakes twining round the trunk of a tall tree, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing it like a
wreath, and thus riſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending at pleaſure. In theſe
countries, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſerpent is too formidable to become an object of
curioſity, for it excites much more violent ſenſations.</p>
               <p>We are not, therefore, to reject as wholly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous, the
accounts left us by the ancients of the terrible devaſtations committed by a
ſingle ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. It is probable, in early times, when the arts were little
known, and mankind were but thinly ſcattered over the earth, that ſerpents,
conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing undiſturbed poſſeſſors of the foreſt, grew 
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0824000107:168"/> to an amazing magnitude; and every other tribe of
animals fell before them. It then might have happened, that ſerpents reigned
the tyrants of a diſtrict for centuries together. To animals of this kind,
grown by time and rapacity to an hundred or an hundred and fifty feet in
length, the lion, the tiger, and even the elephant itſelf, were but feeble
opponents. The dreadful mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſpread deſolation round him; every
creature that had life was devoured, or fled to a diſtance. That horrible
<hi>faetor</hi> which even the commoneſt and the moſt harmleſs ſnakes
are ſtill found to diffuſe, might, in theſe larger ones, become too
powerful for any living being to withſtand; and while they preyed without
diſtinction, they might thus alſo have poiſoned the atmoſphere around
them. In this manner, having for ages lived in the hidden and unpeopled
foreſt, and finding, as their appetites were more powerful, the quantity of
their prey decreaſing, it is poſſible they might venture boldly from
their retreats, into the more cultivated parts of the country, and carry
conſternation among mankind, as they had before deſolation among the lower
ranks of nature. We have many hiſtories of antiquity, preſenting us ſuch
a picture; and exhibiting a whole nation ſinking under the ravages of a
ſingle ſerpent. At that time man had not learned the art of uniting the
efforts of <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0824000107:169"/> many, to effect one great purpoſe.
Oppoſing multitudes only added new victims to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral calamity, and
encreaſed mutual embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment and terror. The animal was therefore to
be ſingly oppoſed by him who had the greateſt ſtrength, the beſt
armour, and the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage. In ſuch an encounter, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
muſt have fallen; till one, more lucky than the reſt, by a fortunate blow,
or by taking the monſter in its torpid interval, and ſurcharged with
ſpoil, might kill, and thus rid his country of the deſtroyer. Such was the
original oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation of heroes; and thoſe who firſt obtained that name,
from their deſtroying the ravagers of the earth, gained it much more
deſervedly than their ſucceſſors, who acquired their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation only
for their ſkill in deſtroying each other. But as we deſcend into more
enlightened anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, we find theſe animals leſs formidable, as being
attacked in a more ſucceſsful manner. We are told, that while Regulus led
his army along the banks of the river Bagrada in Africa, an enormous ſerpent
diſputed his paſſage over. We are aſſured by Pliny, who ſays that
he himſelf ſaw the ſkin, that it was an hundred and twenty feet long, and
that it had deſtroyed many of the army. At laſt, however, the battering
engines were brought out againſt it; and theſe aſſailing 
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0824000107:170"/> it at a diſtance, it was ſoon deſtroyed. Its
ſpoils were carried to Rome, and the general was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed an ovation for his
ſucceſs. There are, perhaps, few facts better aſcertained in hiſtory
than this: an ovation was a remarkable honour; and was given only for ſome
ſignal exploit, that did not deſerve a triumph: no hiſtorian would offer
to invent that part of the ſtory at leaſt, without being ſubject to the
moſt ſhameful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. The ſkin was kept for ſeveral years after in
the Capitol; and Pliny ſays, he ſaw it there: now, though Pliny was a
credulous writer, he was by no means a <hi>falſe</hi> one; and whatever he
ſays he has ſeen, we may very ſafely rely on. At preſent, indeed,
ſuch ravages from ſerpents are ſcarce ſeen in any part of the world;
not but that in Africa and America, ſome of them are powerful enough to brave
the aſſaults of men to this day.</p>
               <p>But happily for us, we are placed at ſuch a diſtance as to
take a view of this tribe, without fearing for our ſafety; we can ſurvey
their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent malignity with the ſame delight with which the poet
deſcribes the terrors of a dead monſter. 
<q> 
                     <l>Nequeunt expleri corda tuendo</l> 
                     <l>Terribles occulos villoſaque ſetis pectore.</l>
                  </q> To
us their ſlender form, their undulating motion, their vivid colouring, their
horrid ſtench, their forky tongue, and their envenomed <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0824000107:171"/>
fangs, are totally harmleſs; and in this country their uſes even ſerve to
counterbalance the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they ſometimes occaſion.</p>
               <p>If we take a ſurvey of ſerpents in general, they have marks
by which they are diſtinguiſhed from all the reſt of animated nature.
They have the length and the ſuppleneſs of the eel, but want fins to ſwim
with; they have the ſcaly covering and pointed tail of the lizard, but they
want legs to walk with; they have the crawling motion of the worm, but, unlike
that animal, they have lungs to breathe with: like all the reptile kind, they
are reſentful when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; and Nature has ſupplied them with terrible
arms to revenge every injury.</p>
               <p>Though they are poſſeſſed of very different degrees of
malignity, yet they are all formidable to man, and have a ſtrong ſimilitude
of form to each other; and it will be proper to mark the general characters
before we deſcend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. With reſpect to their conformation, all
ſerpents have a very wide mouth, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſize of the head;
and what is very extraordinary, they can gape and ſwallow the head of another
animal which is three times as big as their own. I have ſeen a toad taken out
of the belly of a ſnake, at Lord Spencer's, near London, the body of which
was thrice the <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0824000107:172"/> diameter of the animal that ſwallowed
it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is no way ſurprizing that the ſkin of the ſnake ſhould
ſtretch to receive ſo large a morſel; the wonder ſeems how the jaws
could take it in. To explain this, it muſt be obſerved that the jaws of
this animal do not open as ours, in the manner of a pair of hinges, where bones
are applied to bones and play upon one another; on the contrary, the
ſerpent's jaws are held together at the roots by a ſtretching muſcular
ſkin; by which means they open as widely as the animal chuſes to ſtretch
them, and admit of a prey much thicker than the ſnake's own body. The throat,
like ſtretching leather, dilates to admit the morſel; the ſtomach
receives it in part; and the reſt remains in the gullet, till putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the juices of the ſerpent's body unite to diſſolve it.</p>
               <p>As to the teeth, I will talk more of them when I come to treat
of the viper's poiſon; it will be ſufficient here to obſerve, that ſome
ſerpents have fangs, or canine teeth, and others are without them. The teeth
in all are crooked and hollow; and, by a peculiar contrivance, are capable of
being erected or depreſſed at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The eyes of all ſerpents are ſmall, if compared to the
length of the body; and though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently coloured in different kinds, yet
the <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0824000107:173"/> appearance of all is malign and heavy; and from
their known qualities, they ſtrike the imagination with the idea of a
creature me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating miſchief. In ſome, the upper eye-lid is wanting, and
the ſerpent winks only with that below; in others, the animal has a
nicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating membrane or ſkin, reſembling that which is found in birds,
which keeps the eye clean and preſerves the ſight. The ſubſtance of the
eye in all is hard and horny; the chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaline humour occupying a great part
of the globe.</p>
               <p>The holes for hearing are very viſible in all: but there are
no conduits for ſmelling; though it is probable that ſome of them enjoy
that ſenſe in tolerable perfection.</p>
               <p>The tongue in all theſe animals is long and forky. It is
compoſed of two long fleſhy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which terminate in ſharp
points, and are very pliable. At the root it is connected very ſtrongly to
the neck by two tendons, that give it a variety of play. Some of the viper kind
have tongues a fifth part of the length of their bodies; they are continually
darting them out, but they are entirely harmleſs, and only terrify thoſe
who are ignorant of the real ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their poiſon.</p>
               <p>If from the jaws we go on to the gullet, we 
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0824000107:174"/> ſhall find it very wide for the animal's ſize, and
capable of being diſtended to a great degree; at the bottom of this lies the
ſtomach, which is not ſo capacious, and receives only a part of the prey,
while the reſt continues in the gullet for digeſtion. When the
ſubſtance in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is diſſolved into chyle, it paſſes into
the inteſtines, and from thence goes to nouriſhment, or to be excluded by
the vent.</p>
               <p>Like moſt other animals, ſerpents are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with
lungs, which I ſuppoſe are ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in breathing, though we cannot
perceive the manner in which this operation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; for though
ſerpents are often ſeen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently to draw in their breath, yet we cannot
find the ſmalleſt ſigns of their ever reſpiring it again. Their lungs
however are long and large, and doubtleſs are neceſſary to promote their
languid circulation. The heart is formed as in the tortoiſe, the frog, and
the lizard kinds, ſo as to work without the aſſiſtance of the lungs. It
is ſingle, the greateſt part of the blood flowing from the great vein to
the great artery by the ſhorteſt courſe. By this contrivance of Nature we
eaſily gather two conſequences; that ſnakes are amphibious, being equally
capable of living on land and in the water; and, that alſo they are torpid in
winter, like the bat, the <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0824000107:175"/> lizard, and other animals
formed in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>The vent in theſe animals ſerves for the emiſſion of the
urine and the faeces, and for the purpoſes of generation. The inſtrument of
generation in the male is double, being forked like the tongue; the ovaries in
the female are double alſo; and the aperture is very large, in order to
receive the double inſtrument of the male. They copulate in their retreats;
and it is ſaid by the ancients, that in this ſituation they appear like one
ſerpent with two heads; but how far this remark is founded in truth, I do not
find any of the moderns that can reſolve me.</p>
               <p>As the body of this animal is long, ſlender, and capable of
bending in every direction, the number of joints in the back-bone are numerous
beyond what one would imagine. In the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of quadrupedes, they amount
to not above thirty or forty; in the ſerpent kind they amount to an hundred
and forty-five from the head to the vent, and twenty-five more from that to the
tail<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Vide Charat. Anatom.</bibl>
                  </note>. The
number of theſe joints muſt give the back-bone a ſurprizing degree of
pliancy; but this is ſtill encreaſed by the manner in which each of theſe
joints are locked into the <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0824000107:176"/> other. In man and
quadrupedes, the flat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces of the bones are laid one againſt the
other, and bound tight by ſinews; but in ſerpents the bones play one within
the other like ball and ſocket, ſo that they have full motion upon each
other in every direction<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Derham, p.
396.</bibl>
                  </note>. Thus if a man were to form a machine compoſed of ſo
many joints as are found in the back of a ſerpent, he would find it no eaſy
matter to give it ſuch ſtrength and pliancy at the ſame time. The chain
of a watch is but a bungling piece of workmanſhip in compariſon.</p>
               <p>Though the number of joints in the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone is great, yet that
of the ribs is ſtill greater; for, from the head to the vent, there are two
ribs to every joint, which makes their number two hundred and ninety in all.
Theſe ribs are furniſhed with muſcles; four in number; which being
inſerted into the head, run along to the end of the tail, and give the animal
great ſtrength and agility in all its motions.</p>
               <p>The ſkin alſo contributes to its motions, being compoſed
of a number of ſcales, united to each other by a tranſparent membrane,
which grows harder as it grows older, until the animal changes, which is
generally done twice a year. This cover then burſts near the head, and the
ſerpent <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0824000107:177"/> creeps from it, by an undulatory motion, in a
new ſkin, much more vivid than the former. If the old ſlough be then
viewed, every ſcale will be diſtinctly ſeen, like a piece of net-work,
and will be found greateſt where the part of the body they covered was
largeſt.</p>
               <p>There is much geometrical neatneſs in the diſpoſal of the
ſerpent's ſcales, for aſſiſting the animal's ſinuous motion. As the
edges of the foremoſt ſcales lie over the ends of their following ſcales,
ſo thoſe edges, when the ſcales are erected, which the animal has a power
of doing in a ſmall degree, catch in the ground, like the nails in the wheel
of a chariot, and ſo promote and facilitate the animal's progreſſive
motion. The erecting theſe ſcales is by means of a multitude of diſtinct
muſcles, with which each is ſupplied, and one end of which is tacked each
to the middle of the foregoing.</p>
               <p>In ſome of the ſerpent kind there is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt
ſymmetry in theſe ſcales; in others they are diſpoſed more
irregularly. In ſome there are larger ſcales on the belly, and often
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the number of ribs; in others, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the animal is without
them. Upon this ſlight difference, Linnaeus has founded his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions
of the various claſſes of the ſerpent tribe. Human curioſity, however,
and even human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0824000107:178"/> ſeem to plead for a very
different method of diſtribution. It is not the number of ſcales on a
formidable animal's belly, nor their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude or variety, that any way excite
our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. The firſt queſtion that every man will naturally aſk, when
he hears of a ſnake, is, whether it be large: the ſecond, whether it be
venomous? In other words, the ſtrongeſt lines in the animal's hiſtory are
thoſe that firſt excite our attention; and theſe it is every
hiſtorian's buſineſs to diſplay.</p>
               <p>When we come to compare ſerpents with each other, the firſt
great diſtinction appears in their ſize; no other tribe of animals
differing ſo widely in this particular. What, for inſtance, can be ſo
remotely ſeparated as the Great Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boija of Surinam, that grows to
thirty-ſix feet long; and the Little Serpent, at the Cape of Good Hope and
the north of the river Senegal, that is not above three inches, and covers
whole ſandy deſarts with its multitudes! This tribe of animals, like that
of fiſhes, ſeems to have no bounds put to their growth: their bones are in
great meaſure cartilaginous, and they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently capable of great
extenſion; the older, therefore, a ſerpent becomes, the larger it grows;
and as they ſeem to live to a great age, they arrive at an enormous
ſize.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0824000107:179"/>Leguat aſſures us, that he ſaw one
in Java, that was fifty feet long. Carli mentions their growing to above forty
feet; and we have now the ſkin of one in the Muſaeum, that meaſures
thirty-two. Mr. Wentworth, who had large concerns in the Brebices in America,
aſſures me, that, in that country, they grow to an enormous length. He one
day ſent out a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, with an Indian, to kill wild fowl for the table;
and they accordingly went ſome miles from the fort: in purſuing their game,
the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, who generally marched before, beginning to tire, went to reſt
himſelf upon the fallen trunk of a tree, as he ſuppoſed it to be; but
when he was juſt going to ſit down, the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous monſter began to move,
and the poor ſavage perceiving that he had approached a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boya, the
greateſt of all the ſerpent kind, dropped down in an agony. The ſoldier,
who perceived at ſome diſtance what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, levelled at the
ſerpents head, and, by a lucky aim, ſhot it dead: however he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his
fire until he was aſſured that the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal was killed; and then going up to
reſcue his companion, who was fallen motionleſs by its ſide, he, to his
aſtoniſhment, found him dead likewiſe, being killed by the fright. Upon
his return to the fort, and telling what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0824000107:180"/>
Mr. Wentworth ordered the animal to be brought up, when it was meaſured, and
found to be thirty-ſix feet long. He had the ſkin ſtuffed, and then
ſent to Europe, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Prince of Orange, in whoſe cabinet
it is now to be ſeen at the Hague; but the ſkin has ſhrunk, by drying,
two or three feet.</p>
               <p>In the Eaſt Indies they grow alſo to an enormous ſize;
particularly in the Iſland of Java, where, we are aſſured, that one of
them will deſtroy and devour a buffalo. In a letter, printed in the German
Ephemerides, we have an account of a combat between an enormous ſerpent and a
buffalo, by a perſon, who aſſures us, that he was himſelf a
ſpectator. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent had for ſome time been waiting near the brink of
a pool, in expectation of its prey; when a buffalo was the firſt that
offered. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darted upon the affrighted animal, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly began to
wrap it round with its volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous twiſtings; and at every twiſt the bones
of the buffalo were heard to crack almoſt as loud as the report of a cannon.
It was in vain that the poor animal ſtruggled and bellowed; its enormous
enemy entwined it too cloſely to get free; till at length, all its bones
being maſhed to pieces, like thoſe of a malefactor on the wheel, and the
whole body reduced to one <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0824000107:181"/> uniform maſs, the ſerpent
untwined its folds to ſwallow its prey at leiſure. To prepare for this, and
in order to make the body ſlip down the throat more glibly, it was ſeen to
lick the whole body over, and thus cover it with its mucous. It then began to
ſwallow it at that end that offered leaſt reſiſtance; while its length
of body was dilated to receive its prey, and thus took in at once a morſel
that was three times its own thickneſs. We are aſſured by travellers,
that theſe animals are often found with the body of a ſtag in their gullet,
while the horns, which they are unable to ſwallow, keep ſticking out at
their mouths.</p>
               <p>But it is happy for mankind that the rapacity of theſe
frightful creatures is often their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for whenever any of the
ſerpent kind have gorged themſelves in this manner, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their body is
ſeen particularly diſtended with food, they then become torpid, and may be
approached and deſtroyed with ſafety. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of hunger to a ſurprizing
degree, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſeize and ſwallow their prey, they ſeem, like
ſurfeited gluttons, unwieldy, ſtupid, helpleſs, and ſleepy: they at
that time ſeek ſome retreat, where they may lurk for ſeveral days
together, and digeſt their meal in ſafety: the ſmalleſt effort at that
time is capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying them; they can ſcarce make any
reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0824000107:182"/> and they are equally unqualified for
flight or oppoſition: that is the happy opportunity of attacking them with
ſucceſs; at that time the naked Indian himſelf does not fear to
aſſail them. But it is otherwiſe when this ſleepy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of
digeſtion is over; they then iſſue, with famiſhed appetites, from their
retreats, and with accumulated terrors, while every ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal of the foreſt
flies before them.</p>
               <p>Carli deſcribes the Long Serpent of Congo, making its track
through the tall graſs, like mowers in a ſummer's day. He could not
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out terror behold whole lines of graſs lying le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled under the ſweep
of its tail. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it moved forward with great rapidity, until it
found a proper ſituation frequented by its prey: there it continued to lurk,
in patient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and would have remained for weeks together, had it not
been diſturbed by the natives.</p>
               <p>Other creatures have a choice in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; but the
ſerpent indiſcriminately preys upon all; the buffalo, the tiger, and the
gazelle. One would think that the porcupine's quills might be ſufficient to
protect it; but whatever has life, ſerves to appeaſe the hunger of theſe
devouring creatures: porcupines, with all their quills, have frequently been
found in their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, when killed and opened; nay, they moſt frequently
are ſeen to devour each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0824000107:183"/>A life of ſavage hoſtility in the
foreſt, offers the imagination one of the moſt tremendous pictures in
nature. In thoſe burning countries, where the ſun dries up every brook for
hundreds of miles round; when what had the appearance of a great river in the
rainy ſeaſon, becomes, in ſummer, one dreary bed of ſand; in thoſe
countries, I ſay, a lake that is never dry, or a brook that is perennial, is
conſidered by every animal as the greateſt convenience of nature. As to
food, the luxuriant landſcape ſupplies that in ſufficient abundance: it
is the want of water that all animals endeavour to remove; and inwardly parched
by the heat of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, traverſe whole deſarts to find out a ſpring.
When they have diſcovered this, no dangers can deter them from attempting to
ſlake their thirſt. Thus the neighbourhood of a rivulet, in the heart of
the tropical continents, is generally the place where all the hoſtile tribes
of nature draw up for the engagement. On the banks of this little envied
ſpot, thouſands of animals of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds are ſeen venturing to quench
their thirſt, or preparing to ſeize their prey. The elephants are perceived
in a long line, marching from the darker parts of the foreſt; the buffalos
are there, depending upon numbers for ſecurity; the gazells relying ſolely
upon their ſwiftneſs; <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0824000107:184"/> the lion and tiger waiting a
proper opportunity to ſeize; but chiefly the larger ſerpents are upon guard
there, and defend the acceſſes of the lake. Not an hour paſſes without
ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful combat; but the ſerpent, defended by its ſcales, and
naturally capable of ſuſtaining a multitude of wounds, is, of all others,
the moſt formidable. It is the moſt wakeful alſo; for the whole tribe
ſleep with their eyes open, and are conſequently for ever upon the watch:
ſo that, till their rapacity is ſatisfied, few other animals will venture
to approach their ſtation.</p>
               <p>But though theſe animals are, of all others, the moſt
voracious, and though the morſel which they ſwallow without chewing, is
greater than what any other creature, either by land or water, the whale
itſelf not excepted, can devour, yet no animals upon earth bear abſtinence
ſo long as they. A ſingle meal, with many of the ſnake kind, ſeems to
be the adventure of a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; it is an occurrence for which they have been
for weeks, nay ſometimes for months, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient expectation of. When they
have ſeized their prey, their induſtry for ſeveral weeks is entirely
diſcontinued; the fortunate capture of an hour, often ſatisfies them for
the remaining period of their annual activity. As their blood is colder than
that of moſt other terreſtial ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and as it circulates but ſlowly
through <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0824000107:185"/> their bodies, ſo their powers of digeſtion
are but feeble. Their prey continues, for a long time, partly in the ſtomach,
partly in the gullet; and is often ſeen a part hanging out of the mouth. In
this manner it digeſts by degrees; and in proportion as the part below is
diſſolved, the part above is taken in. It is not therefore till this
tedious operation is entirely performed, that the ſerpent renews its appetite
and its activity. But ſhould any accident prevent it from iſſuing once
more from its cell, it ſtill can continue to bear famine, for weeks, months,
nay for years together. Vipers are often kept in boxes for ſix or eight
months, without any food whatever; and there are little ſerpents ſometimes
ſent over to Europe, from Grand Cairo, the name of which I have not been able
to learn, that live for ſeveral years in glaſſes, and never eat at all,
nor even ſtain the glaſs with their excrements. Thus the ſerpent tribe
unite in themſelves two very oppoſite qualities; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful abſtinence,
and yet incredible rapacity.</p>
               <p>If leaving the conſideration of their appetites, we come to
compare ſerpents as to their voices, ſome are found ſilent, ſome have a
peculiar cry, but hiſſing is the ſound which they moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſend
forth, either as a call to their kind, or as a threat to their enemies. In the
countries <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0824000107:186"/> where they abound, they are generally ſilent
in the middle of the day, when they are obliged to retire from the heat of the
climate; but as the cool of the evening approaches, they are then heard
iſſuing from their cells, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued hiſſings; and ſuch is the
variety of their notes, that ſome have aſſured me they very much
reſemble the muſic of an Engliſh grove. This, ſome will hardly credit:
at any rate, ſuch notes, however pleaſing, can give but very little
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, when we call to mind the malignity of the minſtrel. If conſidered
indeed, as they anſwer the animal's own occaſions, they will be found well
adapted to its nature, and fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the purpoſes of terrifying
ſuch as would venture to offend it.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to motion, ſome ſerpents, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
thoſe of the viper kind, move ſlowly; while others, ſuch as the
Ammodytes, dart with amazing ſwiftneſs. The motion in all is ſimilar; but
the ſtrength of body in ſome gives a very different appearance. The viper,
that is but a ſlow, feeble-bodied animal, makes way in a heavy undulating
manner; advancing its head, then drawing up its tail behind, and bending the
body into a bow; then from the ſpot where the head and tail were united,
advancing the head forward as before. This, which is the <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0824000107:187"/>
motion of all ſerpents, is very different from that of the earth-worm, or the
naked ſnail. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, as was ſaid above, has a back-bone, with
numerous joints; and this bone the animal has a power of bending in every
direction, but without being able to ſhorten or lengthen it at pleaſure.
The earth-worm, on the other hand, has no back-bone; but its body is compoſed
of rings, which, like a barber's puff, it can lengthen or ſhorten as it finds
neceſſary. The earth-worm, therefore, in order to move forward, lengthens
the body; then, by the fore part clings to the ground, where it has reached,
and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and brings up its rear: then, when the body is thus
ſhortened, the fore part is length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened again for another progreſſion;
and ſo on. The ſerpent, inſtead of ſhortening the body, bends it into
an arch; and this is the principal difference between ſerpentine and
vermicular progreſſion.</p>
               <p>I have inſtanced this motion in the viper, as moſt eaſily
diſcerned; but there are many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents that dart with ſuch amazing
ſwiftneſs, that they appear rather to leap than crawl. It is moſt
probable, however, that no ſerpent can dart upon even ground farther than its
own length at one effort. Our fears indeed, may encreaſe the force of their
ſpeed, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0824000107:188"/> found ſo fatal. We are
told by ſome, that they will dart to a very great diſtance; but this my
enquiries have never been able to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The manner of progreſſion
in the ſwifteſt ſerpent we know, which is the Jaculus, is by inſtantly
coiling itſelf upon its tail, and darting from thence to its full extent;
then carrying the tail, as quick as lightening, to the head; coiling and
darting again: and by this means proceeding, with extreme rapidity, without
ever quitting the ground. Indeed, if we conſider the length and the
weakneſs of the back-bone in all theſe animals; if we regard the make of
their vertebrae, in which we ſhall find the junctures all formed to give
play, and none to give power; we cannot be of opinion that they have a faculty
of ſpringing from the ground, as they entirely want a <hi>fulcrum,</hi> if I
may ſo expreſs it, from whence to take their ſpring; the whole body being
compoſed of unſupported muſcles and joints that are yielding. It muſt
be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that they dart down from trees upon their prey; but their
weight alone is ſufficient for that purpoſe, without much effort of their
own.</p>
               <p>Though all ſerpents are amphibious, ſome are much fonder of
the water than others; and though deſtitute of fins or gills, remain at the
bottom, or ſwim along the ſurface with great eaſe. From their internal
ſtructure, juſt ſketched <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0824000107:189"/> above, we ſee how well
adapted they are for either element; and how capable their blood is of
circulating at the bottom, as freely as in the frog or the tortoiſe. They
can, however, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to live in freſh-water only; for ſalt is an effectual
bane to the whole tribe. The greateſt ſerpents are moſt uſually found
in freſh-water, either chuſing it as their favourite element, or finding
their prey in ſuch places in the greateſt abundance. But that all will live
and ſwim in liquids, appears from the experiment of Redi; who put a ſerpent
into a large glaſs veſſel of wine, where it lived ſwimming about ſix
hours; though, when it was by force immerſed and kept under that liquid, it
lived only one hour and an half. He put another in common water, where it lived
three days; but when it was kept under water, it lived only about twelve
hours<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Redi, Exper. p. 170.</bibl>
                  </note>. Their
motion there, however, is perfectly the reverſe of what it is upon land; for,
in order to ſupport themſelves upon an element lighter than their bodies,
they are obliged to encreaſe their ſurface in a very artificial manner. On
earth their windings are perpendicular to the ſurface; in water they are
parallel to it: in other words, if I ſhould wave my hand up and down, it will
give an idea of the animal's progreſs on land; if <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0824000107:190"/> I
ſhould wave it to the right and left, it will give ſome idea of its
progreſs on the water.</p>
               <p>Some ſerpents have a moſt horrible faetor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them,
which is alone capable of intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the brave. This proceeds from two
glands near the vent, like thoſe in the weaſel or polecat; and, like
thoſe animals, in proportion as they are excited by rage or by fear, the
ſcent grows ſtronger. It would ſeem, however, that ſuch ſerpents as
are moſt venomous, are leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive in this particular; ſince the
rattleſnake and the viper have no ſmell whatever: nay, we are told, that at
Calecut and Cranganon, in the Eaſt Indies, there are ſome very noxious
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, who are ſo far from being diſagreeable, that their excrements
are ſought after, and kept as the moſt pleaſing perfume. The Eſculapian
Serpent is alſo of this number.</p>
               <p>Some ſerpents bring forth their young alive; as the viper:
ſome bring forth eggs, which are hatched by the heat of their ſituation; as
the Common Black Snake, and the majority of the ſerpent tribe. When a reader,
ignorant of anatomy, is told, that ſome of thoſe animals produce their
young alive, and that ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce eggs only, he is apt to ſuppoſe a
very great difference in the internal conformation, which makes ſuch a
variety in the manner of <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0824000107:191"/> bringing forth. But this is not
the caſe: theſe animals are internally alike, in whatever manner they
produce their young; and the variety in their bringing forth, is rather a
ſlight than a real diſcrimination. The only difference is, that the viper
hatches her eggs, and brings them to maturity within her body; the ſnake is
more premature in her productions, and ſends her eggs into the light, ſome
time before the young ones are capable of leaving the ſhell. Thus, if either
are opened, the eggs will be found in the womb, covered with their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
ſhell, and adhering to each other, like large beads on a ſtring. In the
eggs of both the young ones will be found, though at different ſtages of
maturity: thoſe of the viper will crawl and bite in the moment the ſhell
that encloſes them is broke open; thoſe of the ſnake are not yet arrived
at their perfect form.</p>
               <p>Father Labat took a ſerpent of the viper kind, that was nine
feet long, and ordered it to be opened in his preſence. He then ſaw the
manner in which the eggs of theſe animals lie in the womb. In this creature
there were ſix eggs, each of the ſize of a gooſe egg, but longer, more
pointed, and covered with a membranous ſkin, by which alſo they were united
to each other. Each of theſe eggs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from thirteen to fifteen young
ones, <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0824000107:192"/> about ſix inches long, and as thick as a
gooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quill. Though the female from whence they were taken was ſpotted, the
young ſeemed to have a variety of colours very different from the parent; and
this led the traveller to ſuppoſe that the colour was no characteriſtic
mark among ſerpents. Theſe little miſchievous animals were no ſooner
let looſe from the ſhell, than they crept about, and put themſelves into
a threatening poſture, coiling themſelves up and biting the ſtick with
which he was deſtroying them. In this manner he killed ſeventy-four young
ones; thoſe that were contained in one of the eggs eſcaped at the place
where the female was killed, by the burſting of the egg and their getting
among the buſhes.</p>
               <p>The laſt diſtinction that I ſhall mention, but the moſt
material among ſerpents is, that ſome are venomous and ſome
inoffenſive. If we conſider the poiſon of ſerpents as it relates to
man, there is no doubt but that it is a ſcourge and an affliction. The
various calamities that the poiſon of ſerpents is capable of producing, are
not only inflicted by the animal itſelf, but by men more miſchievous even
than ſerpents, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their venom to deſtroy each other. With this
the ſavages poiſon their arms, and alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their revengeful
potions. The ancients were known to preſerve it for the purpoſes of
ſuicide; <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0824000107:193"/> and even among ſemi barbarous countries at
this day, the venom of ſnakes is uſed as a philtre.</p>
               <p>But. though the poiſon be juſtly terrible to us, it has been
given to very good purpoſes for the animal's own proper ſupport and
defence. Without this, ſerpents of all other animals would be the moſt
expoſed and defenceleſs; without feet for eſcaping a purſuit; without
teeth capable of inflicting a dangerous wound, or without ſtrength for
reſiſtance; incapable, from their ſize, of finding ſecurity in very
ſmall retreats like the earth-worm, and diſguſting all from their
deformity, nothing was left for them but a ſpeedy extirpation. But
furniſhed as they are with powerful poiſon, every rank of animals approach
them with dread, and never ſeize them but at an advantage. Nor is this all
the advantage they derive from it. The malignity of a few ſerves for the
protection of all. Though not above a tenth of their number are actually
venomous, yet the ſimilitude they all bear to each other excites a general
terror of the whole tribe; and the uncertainty of their enemies in which the
poiſon chiefly reſides, makes even the moſt harmleſs formidable. Thus
Providence ſeems to have acted with double precaution; it has given ſome of
them poiſon for the general defence of a tribe naturally feeble; but it has 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0824000107:194"/> thinned the numbers of thoſe which are venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
leſt they ſhould become too powerful for the reſt of animated nature.</p>
               <p>From theſe noxious qualities in the ſerpent kind, it is no
wonder that not only man, but beaſts and birds, carry on an unceaſing war
againſt them. The ichneumon of the Indians, and the pecary of America,
deſtroy them in great numbers. Theſe animals have the art of ſeizing them
near the head; and it is ſaid that they can ſkin them with great
dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The vulture and the eagle alſo prey upon them in great abundance;
and often ſouſing down from the clouds, drop upon a long ſerpent, which
they ſnatch up ſtruggling and writhing in the air. Dogs alſo are bred up
to oppoſe them. Father Feuillée tells us, that being in the woods of
Martinico, he was attacked by a large ſerpent, which he could not eaſily
avoid, when his dog immediately came to his relief, and ſeized the
aſſailant with great courage. The ſerpent entwined him, and preſſed
him ſo violently, that the blood came out of his mouth, and yet the dog never
ceaſed till he had tore it to pieces. The dog was not ſenſible of his
wounds during the fight; but ſoon after his head ſwelled prodigiouſly,
and he lay on the ground as dead. But his maſter <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0824000107:195"/>
having found hard by a banana tree, he applied its juice, mixed with treacle,
to the wounds, which recovered the dog, and quickly healed his ſores.</p>
               <p>But it is in man that theſe venomous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures find the
moſt dangerous enemy. The Pſylli of old were famous for charming and
deſtroying ſerpents. Some moderns pretend to the ſame art. Caſſaubon
ſays that he knew a man who could at any time ſummon an hundred ſerpents
together, and draw them into the fire. Upon a certain occaſion, when one of
them bigger than the reſt would not be brought in, he only repeated his
charm, and it came forward, like the reſt, to ſubmit to the flames.
Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus deſcribes particularly how the Indians charm ſerpents. 
<q rend="inline">"They take a ſcarlet robe embroidered with
golden letters, and ſpread it before a ſerpent's hole. The golden letters
have a faſcinating power; and by looking ſtedfaſtly, the ſerpent's eyes
are overcome and laid aſleep."</q> Theſe and many other feats have been
often practiſed upon theſe animals by artful men, who had firſt prepared
the ſerpents for their exerciſe, and then exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited them as
adventitiouſly aſſembled at their call. In India there is nothing ſo
common as dancing ſerpents, which are carried about in a 
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0824000107:196"/> broad flat veſſel ſomewhat reſembling a ſieve.
Theſe erect and put themſelves in motion at the word of command. When their
keeper ſings a ſlow tune, they ſeem by their heads to keep time; when he
ſings a quicker meaſure, they appear to move more briſk and lively. All
animals have a certain degree of docility; and we find that ſerpents
themſelves can be brought to move and approach at the voice of their
maſter. From this trick ſucceſsfully practiſed before the ignorant, it
is moſt probable has ariſen all the boaſted pretenſions which ſome
have made to charming of ſerpents; an art to which the native Americans
pretend at this very day. One of Linnaeus's pupils we are told pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the
ſecret from an Indian, and then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it to his maſter; but, like
all ſecrets of the kind, it is probable this ended in a few unmeaning words
of no efficacy.</p>
               <p>Though the generality of mankind regard this formidable race
with horror, yet there have been ſome nations, and there are ſome at this
day, that conſider them with veneration and regard. The adoration paid by the
ancient Egyptians to a ſerpent is well known: many of the nations at
preſent along the weſtern coaſt of Africa retain the ſame unaccountable
veneration. Upon the gold and ſlave coaſts, a ſtranger, 
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0824000107:197"/> upon entering the cottages of the natives, is often
ſurprized to ſee the roof ſwarming with ſerpents, that cling there
without moleſting and unmoleſted by the natives. But his ſurprize will
encreaſe upon going farther ſouthward to the kingdom of Widah, when he
finds that a ſerpent is the god of the country. This animal, which travellers
deſcribe as a huge overgrown creature, has its habitation, its temple, and
its prieſts. Theſe impreſs the vulgar with an opinion of its virtues; and
numbers are daily ſeen to offer not only their goods, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
and their prayers, at the ſhrine of their hideous deity, but alſo their
wives and daughters. Theſe the prieſts readily accept of, and after ſome
days of penance, return them to their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants, much benefited by the
ſerpent's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed embraces. Such a complicated picture of ignorance and
impoſture gives no very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable impreſſions of our fellow creatures;
but we may ſay in defence of human nature, that the moſt frightful of
reptiles is worſhipped by the moſt uncultivated and barbarous of
mankind.</p>
               <p>From this general picture of the ſerpent tribe, one great
diſtinction obviouſly preſents itſelf; namely, into thoſe that are
venomous and thoſe that are wholly deſtitute of poiſon. 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0824000107:198"/> To the firſt belong the viper, the rattleſnake, the
cobra di capello, and all their affinities: to the other, the common black
ſnake, the lyboya, the boiguacu, the amphiſbaena, and various others that,
though deſtitute of venom, do not ceaſe to be formidable. I will therefore
give their hiſtory ſeparately, beginning with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous claſs as they
have the ſtrongeſt claims to our notice and attention.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of venomous Serpents in general.</head>
               <p>THE poiſon of ſerpents has been for ages one of the
greateſt objects of human conſideration. To us who ſeldom feel the
vengeful wound, it is merely a ſubject of curioſity; but to thoſe placed
in the midſt of the ſerpent tribe, who are every day expoſed to ſome
new diſaſter, it becomes a matter of the moſt ſerious importance. To
remedy the bite of a ſerpent is conſidered among our phyſicians as one of
the ſlighteſt operations in medicine; but among the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of the
eaſt, the antidotes for this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity make up the bulk of their
diſpenſaries. In our colder climates, the venom does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with that
inſtantaneous operation which it exhibits in the warmer regions; for either
its powers are leſs exquiſite, or our fluids are not carried round in
ſuch rapid circulation.</p>
               <p>In all countries, however, the poiſon of the ſerpent is
ſufficiently formidable to deſerve notice, and to excite our attention to
its nature and effects. It will therefore in the firſt place be proper to
deſcribe its ſeat in the animal, as alſo the inſtrument by which the
wound is made <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0824000107:200"/> and the poiſon injected. In all this
venomous claſs of reptiles, whether the viper, the rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnake, or the
cobra di capello, there are two large teeth or fangs that iſſue from the
upper jaw, and that hang out beyond the lower. The reſt of the ſnake tribe
are deſtitute of theſe; and it is moſt probable that wherever theſe
fangs are wanting, the animal is harmleſs; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, wherever they
are found it is to be avoided as the moſt peſtilent enemy. Theſe are the
inſtruments that ſeem to place the true diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between animals of
the ſerpent kind; the wounds which theſe fangs inflict produce the moſt
dangerous ſymptoms; the wounds inflicted by the teeth only are attended with
nothing more than the ordinary conſequences attending the bite of any other
animal. Our firſt great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, therefore, upon ſeeing a ſerpent
ſhould be directed to the teeth. If it has the fang teeth, it is to be placed
among the venomous, claſs; if it wants them, it may be ſet down as
inoffenſive. I am not ignorant that many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents are ſaid to be
dangerous whoſe jaws are unfurniſhed with fangs; but it is moſt probable
that our terrors only have furniſhed theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals with venom; for of all
the tribe whoſe teeth are thus formed, not one will be found to have a bag
for containing poiſon, nor a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0824000107:201"/> for injecting it
into the wound. The Black Snake, the Liboya, the Blind Worm, and a hundred
others that might be mentioned, have their teeth of an equal ſize, fixed into
the jaws, and with no other apparatus for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting a dangerous wound than a
dog or a lizard; but it is otherwiſe with the venomous tribe we are now
deſcribing; theſe are well furniſhed, not only with an elaboratory where
the poiſon is formed, but a canal by which it is conducted to the jaw, a bag
under the tooth for keeping it ready for every occaſion, and alſo an
aperture in the tooth itſelf for injecting it into the wound. To be more
particular, the glands that ſerve to fabricate this venomous fluid are
ſituated on each ſide of the head behind the eyes, and have their canals
leading from thence to the bottom of the fangs in the upper jaw, where they
empty into a kind of bladder, from whence the fangs on each ſide are ſeen
to grow. The venom contained in this bladder is a yellowiſh thick
taſteleſs liquor, which injected into the blood is death, yet which may be
ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed without any danger.</p>
               <p>The fangs that give the wound come next under obſervation;
they are large in proportion to the ſize of the animal that bears them;
crooked, yet ſharp enough to inflict a ready <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0824000107:202"/> wound.
They grow one on each ſide, and ſometimes two, from two moveable bones in
the upper jaw, which by ſliding backward or forward, have a power of erecting
or depreſſing the teeth at pleaſure. In theſe bones are alſo fixed
many teeth, but no way venomous, and only ſerving to take and hold the
animal's prey. Beſides this apt diſpoſition of the fangs, they are hollow
within, and have an opening towards the point like the ſlit of a pen, through
which when the fang is preſſed down upon the bladder where it grows, there
is ſeen to iſſue a part of the venom that lay below. To deſcribe this
operation at once, when the ſerpent is irritated to give a venomous wound, it
opens its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable jaws to the wideſt extent; the moveable bones of the
upper jaw ſlide forward; the fangs that lay before inclining are thus
erected; they are ſtruck with force into the fleſh of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
perſon; by meeting reſiſtance at the points, they preſs upon the
bladders of venom from whence they grow; the venom iſſues up through the
hollow of the tooth; and is preſſed out through its ſlit into the wound,
which by this time the tooth has made in the ſkin. Thus from a ſlight
puncture, and the infuſion of a drop of venom ſcarce larger than the head
of a pin, the part is quickly enflamed and, without <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0824000107:203"/> a
proper antidote, the whole frame contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>
               <p>The appearances which this venom produces are different,
according to the ſerpent that wounds, or the ſeaſon, or the ſtrength of
the animal that ſtrikes the blow. If a viper inflicts the wound, and the
remedy be neglected, the ſymptoms are not without danger. It firſt cauſes
an acute pain in the place affected, attended with a ſwelling, firſt red,
and afterwards livid. This by degrees ſpreads to the neighbouring parts;
great faintneſs and a quick, though low and interrupted, pulſe enſues: to
this ſucceed great ſickneſs at the ſtomach, billious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive
vomitings, cold ſweats, pains about the navel, and death itſelf. But the
violence of theſe ſymptoms depend much on the ſeaſon of the year, the
difference of the climate, the ſize or rage of the animal, and the depth and
ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wound. Theſe ſymptoms are much more violent, and
ſucceed each other more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly after the bite of a rattle-ſnake; but when
the perſon is bit by the cobra di capello, he dies in an hour, his whole
frame being diſſolved into a putrid maſs of corruption.</p>
               <p>Nothing ſurely can more juſtly excite our wonder than that
ſo ſmall a quantity of venom ſhould produce ſuch powerful and deadly
effects. <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0824000107:204"/> If the venom itſelf be examined through a
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope, it will be found to ſhoot into little chryſtals that, to an
imagination already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with its potency, look like ſo many darts
fit for entering the blood-veſſels, and wounding their tender coats. But
all theſe darts are wholly of our own making; the ſofteſt mildeſt fluid
whatever, poſſeſſed of any conſiſtency, will form chryſtals under
the eye of the micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, and put on an appearance exactly like the venom
of the viper. In fact, this venom has no acrid taſte whatever; and to all
experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that our ſenſes can make upon it, appears a ſlimy inſipid
fluid. Charas, who often taſted it, aſſures us of the fact; and
aſſerts, that it may be taken inwardly without any ſenſible effects or
any prejudice to the conſtitution. But the famous experiments that were tried
by Redi and others, in the preſence of the Great Duke of Tuſcany and his
court, put this beyond any doubt whatſoever. By theſe it appeared, that the
ſerpent having once bitten, exhauſted for that time the greateſt part of
its poiſon; and though the wound cauſed by its biting a ſecond time was
attended with ſome malignant ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, yet they were much milder than
before. It appeared that the ſerpent biting upon a ſponge, or a piece of
ſoft bread, and then biting <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0824000107:205"/> a dog immediately after,
did not inflict a wound more dangerous than the prick of a needle. It appeared
that the venom being collected, and a needle dipped therein, this produced
almoſt as painful effects as the tooth of the animal itſelf. But what
cauſed the greateſt ſurprize in the court was the ſeeming raſhneſs
of one Tozzi, a viper-catcher; who, while the philoſophers were giving
elaborate lectures on the danger of the poiſon when taken internally, boldly
deſired a large quantity of it might be put together; and then, with the
utmoſt confidence, drank it off before them all. The court was ſtruck with
aſtoniſhment, and expected that the man would inſtantly fall dead; but
they ſoon perceived their miſtake, and found that taken in this manner the
poiſon was as harmleſs as water; ſo true is that famous paſſage of
Lucan, 
<q> 
                     <l>Noxia ſerpentum eſt admixto ſanguine peſtis:</l> 
                     <l>Morſu virus habent, et fatum in dente minantur:</l> 
                     <l>Pocula morte carent.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>What then ſhall we ſay to the ſpeedy effect of ſo
ſeemingly harmleſs a liquid taken into the circulation? Let us firſt
obſerve, that milk is one of the moſt mild and nouriſhing of all fluids,
and ſeemingly the moſt friendly to the human conſtitution; yet if milk be
injected into a vein, <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0824000107:206"/> it will quickly become fatal, and
kill with more certain deſtruction than even the venom of the viper. From
hence then we may infer, that the introducing not only the ſerpentine venom,
but alſo a quantity of any other mixture, into the circulation, will be
fatal; and that, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, ſerpents kill as well by their power of
injecting the wound as by the potency of their poiſon. Some indeed may inject
a more acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious mixture, and this may produce more ſpeedy effects; but
any mixture thus injected would be dangerous, and many would be fatal.</p>
               <p>Ray gives us an inſtance of the potency of the ſerpent
poiſon; which, though it has all the air of a fable, I cannot help
tranſcribing. 
<q rend="inline">"A gentleman who went over to the Eaſt-Indies,
while he was one day ſitting among ſome friends, was accoſted by an
Indian ſmuggler, who offered to ſhew him ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments reſpecting
the venom of ſerpents; an exhibition uſual enough in that country. Having
firſt, therefore, produced a large ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he aſſured the company
that it was harmleſs; and to convince them of what he ſaid, he tied up his
arm, as is uſual with thoſe who are going to be bled, and whipped the
ſerpent till it was provoked to bite him. Having drawn in this manner about
half a <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0824000107:207"/> ſpoonful of blood from his arm, he put the
congealed clot upon his thigh. He then took out a much ſmaller ſerpent,
which was no other than the cobra di capello; and having tied up its neck, he
procured about half a drop of its venom, which he ſprinkled on the clot of
blood on his thigh, which inſtantly began to ſerment and bubble, and ſoon
changed colour from a red into yellow."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This he pretended was cauſed by the extreme malignity of that
animal's venom; however, I have no doubt that the whole is either a fable, or a
trick of the Indian; who, while he ſeemed to mix the ſerpent's venom,
actually infuſed ſome ſtronger ingredient, ſome mineral acid, into the
maſs of blood, which was capable of working ſuch a change. It cannot be
ſuppoſed that any animal poiſon could act ſo powerfully upon the blood
already drawn and coagulated; for a poiſon that could operate thus
inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly upon cold blood, could not fail of ſoon deſtroying the
animal itſelf.</p>
               <p>Be this as it will, the effects of ſerpent poiſon are but
too well known, though the manner of operation be not ſo clear. As none of
this malignant tribe grow to a great ſize, the longeſt of them not
exceeding nine feet, they ſeldom ſeek the combat with larger animals, or
offend <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0824000107:208"/> others till they are firſt offended. Did they
exert their malignity in proportion to their power, they could eaſily drive
the ranks of nature before them; but they ſeem unconſcious of their own
ſuperiority, and rather fly than offer to meet the meaneſt oppoſer. Their
food chiefly conſiſts of ſmall prey, ſuch as birds, moles, toads and
lizards; ſo that they never attack the more formidable animals that would
ſeldom die unrevenged. They lurk therefore in the clefts of rocks, or among
ſtony places; they twine round the branches of trees, or ſun themſelves
in the long graſs at the bottom. There they only ſeek repoſe and
ſafety. If ſome unwary traveller invades their retreats, their firſt
effort is to ſly; but when either pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued or accidentally trod upon, they
then make a fierce and fatal reſiſtance. For this purpoſe, they raiſe
themſelves according to their ſtrength upon their tail, erect the head,
ſeize the limb that preſſes them, the wound is given and the head
withdrawn in a moment. It is not therefore without reaſon, that the
Aſiatics, who live in regions where ſerpents greatly abound, wear boots and
long cloaths, which very well protect their lower parts from the accidental
reſentment of their reptile annoyers.</p>
               <p>In the eaſtern and weſtern Indies, the number 
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0824000107:209"/> of noxious ſerpents is various; in this country we are
acquainted only with one. The viper is the only animal in Great Britain from
whoſe bite we have any thing to fear. In the tropical climates, the
rattle-ſnake, the whip-ſnake, and the cobra di capello, are the moſt
formidable, though by no means the moſt common. From the general notoriety of
theſe particular ſerpents, and the univerſal terror which they
occaſion, it would ſeem that few others are poſſeſſed of ſuch
powerful malignity.</p>
               <p>Vipers are found in many parts of this iſland; but the dry,
ſtony, and in particular the chalky, countries abound with them. This animal
ſeldom grows to a greater length than two feet; though ſometimes they are
found above three. The ground colour of their bodies is a dirty yellow; that of
the female is deeper. The back is marked the whole length with a ſeries of
rhomboid black ſpots, touching each other at the points; the ſides with
triangular ones, the belly entirely black. It is chiefly diſtinguiſhed from
the common black ſnake by the colour, which in the latter is more
beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mottled, as well as by the head, which is thicker than the body;
but particularly by the tail, which in the viper, though it ends in a point,
does not run tapering to ſo great a length <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0824000107:210"/> as in the
other. When, therefore, other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions fail, the difference of the tail
can be diſcerned at a ſingle glance.</p>
               <p>The viper differs from moſt other ſerpents in being much
ſlower, as alſo in excluding its young compleatly formed, and bringing them
forth alive. The kindneſs of Providence ſeems exerted not only in
diminiſhing the ſpeed, but alſo the fertility, of this dangerous
creature. They copulate in May, and are ſuppoſed to be about three months
before they bring forth, and have ſeldom above eleven eggs at a time. Theſe
are of the ſize of a blackbird's eggs, and chained together in the womb like
a ſtring of beads. Each egg contains from one to four young ones; ſo that
the whole of a brood may amount to about twenty or thirty. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in
the womb till they come to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as to be able to burſt from the
ſhell; and they are ſaid by their own efforts to creep from their
confinement into the open air, where they continue for ſeveral days without
taking any food whatſoever. 
<q rend="inline">"We have been often aſſured," ſays Mr.
Penant, "by intelligent people, of the truth of a fact, that the young of the
viper when terrified will run down the throat of the parent, and ſeek
ſhelter in its belly in the ſame manner as the young of the 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0824000107:211"/> oppoſſum retire into the ventral pouch of the old
one. From this," continues he, "ſome have imagined that the viper is ſo
unnatural as to devour its own young; but this deſerves no credit, as theſe
animals live upon frogs, toads, lizards, and young birds, which they ſwallow
whole, though the morſel is often three times as thick as their own
body."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The viper is capable of ſupporting very long abſtinence, it
being known that ſome have been kept in a box ſix months without food; yet
du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time they did not abate of their vivacity. They feed only a
ſmall part of the year, but never during their confinement; for if mice,
their favourite diet, ſhould at that time be thrown into their box, though
they will kill, yet they will never eat, them. When at liberty, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
torpid throughout the winter; yet, when confined, have never been obſerved to
take their annual repoſe. Their poiſon, however, decreaſes in proportion
to the length of their confinement; and it is thought, that the virtues of the
animal's fleſh are, by the ſame reſtraints, conſiderably
leſſened.</p>
               <p>They are uſually taken with wooden tongs, by the end of the
tail, which may be done without danger; for, while held in that poſition,
they are unable to wind themſelve up to hurt <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0824000107:212"/> their
enemy: yet, notwithſtanding this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, the viper-catchers are
frequently bit by them; but, by the application of ſallad-oil, the bite is
effectually cured.</p>
               <p>One William Oliver, a viper-catcher at Bath, was the firſt who
diſcovered this admirable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. On the firſt of June, 1735, in the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a great number of perſons, he ſuffered himſelf to be bit
by an old black viper, brought by one of the company, upon the wriſt, and
joint of the thumb of the right hand, ſo that drops of blood came out of the
wounds: he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately felt a violent pain both at the top of his thumb, and
up his arm, even before the viper was looſened from his hand; ſoon after he
felt a pain, reſembling that of burning, trickle up his arm; in a few minutes
his eyes began to look red and fiery, and to water much; in leſs than an hour
he perceived the venom ſeize his heart, with a pricking pain, which was
attended with faintneſs, ſhortneſs of breath, and cold ſweats; in a few
minutes after this, his belly began to ſwell, with great gripings, and pains
in his back, which were attended with vomitings and purgings: during the
violence of theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, his ſight was gone for ſeveral minutes,
but he could hear all the while. He ſaid, that in his former experiments, he
had never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0824000107:213"/> making uſe of his remedy longer
than he perceived the effects of the venom reaching his heart; but this time,
being willing to ſatisfy the company thoroughly, and truſting to the
ſpeedy effects of his remedy, which was nothing more than olive-oil, he
forbore to apply any thing, till he found himſelf exceeding ill and quite
giddy. About an hour and a quarter after the firſt of his being bit, a
chaffing-diſh of glowing charcoal was brought in, and his naked arm was held
over it, as near as he could bear, while his wife rubbed in the oil with her
hand, turning his arm continually round, as if ſhe would have roaſted it
over the coals: he ſaid the poiſon ſoon abated, but the ſwelling did
not diminiſh much. Moſt violent purgings and vomitings ſoon enſued; and
his pulſe became ſo low, and ſo often interrupted, that it was thought
proper to order him a repetition of cordial potions: he ſaid he was not
ſenſible of any great relief from theſe; but that a glaſs or two of
olive-oil drank down, ſeemed to give him eaſe. Continuing in this dangerous
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he was put to bed, where his arm was again bathed over a pan of
charcoal, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with ſallad-oil, heated in a ladle over the charcoal,
by Dr. Mortimer's direction, who was the phyſician that drew up the account.
From <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0824000107:214"/> this laſt operation he declared that he found
immediate eaſe, as though by ſome charm: he ſoon after fell into a
profound ſleep, and, after about nine hours ſound reſt, awaked about
ſix the next morning, and found himſelf very well; but in the afternoon, on
drinking ſome rum and ſtrong beer, ſo as to be almoſt intoxicated, the
ſwelling returned, with much pain and cold ſweats, which abated ſoon, on
bathing the arm, as before, and wrapping it up in a brown pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſoaked in
the oil.</p>
               <p>Such are the effects of the viper's bite; yet its fleſh has
long been celebrated as a noble me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. A broth, made by boiling one viper
in a quart of water till it comes to a pint, is the uſual method in which it
is given at preſent; and it is ſaid to be a very powerful reſtorative in
battered conſtitutions: the ſalt of vipers is alſo thought to exceed any
other animal ſalt whatever, in giving vigour to the languid cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and
prompting to venery.</p>
               <p>The Rattle-ſnake is bred in America, and in no part of the old
world. Some are as thick as a man's leg, and ſix feet in length; but the
moſt uſual ſize is from four to five feet long. In moſt particulars it
reſembles the viper: like that animal, having a large head and a ſmall
neck, being of a duſky colour, and furniſhed <pb facs="tcp:0824000107:215"/>

                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0824000107:216"/> with fangs that inflict the
moſt terrible wounds. It differs, however, in having a large ſcale, which
hangs like a penthouſe over each eye. The eye alſo is furniſhed with a
nictitating membrane, that preſerves it from duſt; and its ſcales are of
a conſiderable degree of hardneſs. They are of an orange, tawny, and
blackiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour on the back; and of an aſh-colour on the belly, inclining
to lead. The male may be readily diſtinguiſhed from the female, by a black
velvet ſpot on the head, and by the head being ſmaller and longer. But that
which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their ſuperior malignity, diſtinguiſhes them from all
other animals, is their rattle, an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lodged in their tail, by which
they make ſuch a loud, rattling noiſe, when they move, that their approach
may readily be perceived, and the danger avoided. This rattle, which is placed
in the tail, ſomewhat reſembles, when taken out of the body, the curb chain
of a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: it is compoſed of ſeveral thin, hard, hollow bones, linked to
each other, and rattling upon the ſlighteſt motion. It is ſuppoſed by
ſome, that the ſnake acquires an additional bone every year; and that, from
hence, its age may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely known: however this may be, certain it is,
that the young ſnakes, of a year or two old, have no rattles at all; while
many old ones have <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0824000107:217"/> been killed, that had from eleven to
thirteen joints each. They ſhake and make a noiſe with theſe rattles with
prodigious quickneſs when they are diſturbed; however, the peccary and the
vulture are no way terrified at the ſound, but haſten, at the ſignal, to
ſeize the ſnake, as their moſt favourite prey.</p>
               <p>It is very different with almoſt every other animal. The
certain death which enſues from this terrible creature's bite, makes a
ſolitude wherever it is heard. It moves along with the moſt majeſtic
rapidity; neither ſeeking to offend the larger animals, nor fearing their
inſults. If unprovoked, it never meddles with any thing but its natural prey;
but when accidentally trod upon, or purſued to be deſtroyed, it then makes
a dreadful and deſperate defence. It erects it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon its tail, throws
back the head, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts its wound in a moment; then parts, and inflicts a
ſecond wound: after which, we are told, by ſome, that it remains torpid and
inactive, without even attempting to eſcape.</p>
               <p>The very inſtant the wound is inflicted, though ſmall in
itſelf, it appears more painful than the ſting of a bee. This pain, which
is ſo ſuddenly felt, far from abating, grows every moment more excruciating
and dangerous: the limb wells; the venom reaches the head, which 
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0824000107:218"/> is ſoon of a monſtrous ſize; the eyes are red and
fiery; the heart beats quick, with frequent interruptions: the pain becomes
inſupportable, and ſome expire under it in five or ſix hours; but others,
who are of ſtronger conſtitutions, ſurvive the agony for a few hours
longer, only to ſink under a general mortification, which enſues, and
corrupts the whole body.</p>
               <p>As a gentleman in Virginia was walking in the fields for his
amuſement, he accidentally trod upon a rattle ſnake, that had been lurking
in a ſtony place; which, enraged by the preſſure, reared up, bit his
hand, and ſhook its rattles. The gentleman readily perceived that he was in
the moſt dreadful danger; but unwilling to die unrevenged, he killed the
ſnake, and carrying it home in his hand, threw it on the ground before his
family, crying out, I am killed, and there is my murderer! In ſuch an
extremity, the ſpeedieſt remedies were the beſt. His arm, which was
beginning to ſwell, was tied up near the ſhoulder, the wound was anointed
with oil, and every precaution taken to ſtop the infection. By the help of a
very ſtrong conſtitution he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; but not without feeling the moſt
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and dreadful ſymptoms for ſeveral weeks together. His arm, below
the ligature, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of ſeveral colours, with a writhing among 
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0824000107:219"/> the muſcles, that, to his terrified imagination,
appeared like the motions of the animal that had wounded him. A fever enſued;
the loſs of his hair, giddineſs, drought, weakneſs, and nervous
faintings: till, by ſlow degrees, a very ſtrong habit overpowered the
latent malignity of the poiſon.</p>
               <p>Several remedies have been tried to alleviate this calamity. A
decoction of the Virginian ſnake-root is conſidered as the moſt
effectual; and at the ſame time the head of the animal bruiſed and laid
upon the part affected, is thought to aſſiſt the cure. In general,
however, it is found to be fatal; and the Indians, ſenſible of this, take
care to dip their arrows in the poiſon under the rattle ſnake's fangs, when
they deſire to take a ſignal revenge of their enemies.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning this animal is agreed upon by every
naturaliſt: there are other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in its hiſtory, which are not
ſo well aſcertained. And firſt, its motion, which ſome deſcribe as
the ſwifteſt imaginable; aſſerting, that its Indian name of Ecacoalt,
which ſignifies the wind-ſerpent, implies its agility: others, on the
contrary, aſſert, that it is the ſloweſt and the moſt ſluggiſh of
all ſerpents; and that it ſeldom moves from one place. In this
oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0824000107:220"/> of opinions, there are others, who
aſſert, that on even ground it moves but ſlowly; but then, among rocks,
that it goes at a great rate. If we may argue from analogy, the opinion of
thoſe who contend for its ſlow motion, ſeems the moſt probable; as the
viper, which it ſo very much reſembles, is remarkable among ſerpents for
its inactivity.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid alſo by ſome, that the rattle-ſnake has a
power of charming its prey into its mouth; and this is as ſtrongly
contradicted by others. The inhabitants of Penſylvania are ſaid to have
opportunities of obſerving this ſtrange faſcination every day. The
ſnake is often ſeen baſking at the foot of a tree, where birds and
ſquirrels make their reſidence. There, coiled upon its tail, its jaws
extended, and its eyes ſhining like fire, the rattle-ſnake levels its
dreadful glare upon one of the little animals above. The bird or the
ſquirrel, which ever it may be, too plainly perceives the miſchief
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating againſt it, and hops from branch to branch, with a timorous,
plaintive ſound, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to avoid, yet incapable of breaking through the
faſcination: thus it continues for ſome time its feeble efforts and
complaints, but is ſtill ſeen approaching lower and lower towards the
bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom branches of the tree, until, at laſt, as if <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0824000107:221"/>
overcome by the potency of its fears, it jumps down from the tree directly into
the throat of its frightful deſtroyer.</p>
               <p>In order to aſcertain the truth of this ſtory, a mouſe was
put into a large iron cage, where a rattle ſnake was kept, and the effects
carefully obſerved. The mouſe remained motionleſs at one end of the cage;
while the ſnake, at the other, continued fixed, with its eye glaring full on
the little animal, and its jaws opened to their wideſt extent: the mouſe
for ſome time ſeemed eager to eſcape; but every effort only ſerved to
encreaſe its terrors, and to draw it ſtill nearer the enemy; till, after
ſeveral ineffectual attempts to break the faſcination, it was ſeen to run
into the jaws of the rattle-ſnake, where it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly killed.</p>
               <p>To theſe accounts the incredulous oppoſe the improbability
of the fact; they aſſert, that ſuch a power aſcribed to ſerpents, is
only the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of a vulgar error, by which it was ſuppoſed that
ſerpents could be charmed, and had alſo a power of charming. They aver,
that animals are ſo far from running down the throat of a rattle ſnake in
captivity, that the ſnake will eat nothing in that ſtate, but actually dies
for want of ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>A ſerpent, called the Whip-ſnake, is ſtill 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0824000107:222"/> more venomous than the former. This animal, which is a
native of the eaſt, is about five feet long, yet not much thicker than the
thong of a coachman's whip. It is exceedingly venomous; and its bite is ſaid
to kill in about ſix hours. One of the Jeſuit miſſionaries, happening
to enter into an Indian pagoda, ſaw what he took to be a whip-cord lying on
the floor, and ſtooped to take it up; but, upon handling it, what was his
ſurprize to find that it was ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, and no other than the whip-ſnake,
of which he had heard ſuch formidable accounts: fortune, however, ſeemed
favourable to him, for he graſped it by the head, ſo that it had no power
to bite him, and only twiſted its folds up his arm. In this manner he held
it, till it was killed by thoſe who came to his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>To this formidable claſs might be added the Aſp, whoſe
bite however is not attended with thoſe drowſy ſymptoms which the
ancients aſcribed to it. The Jaculus of Jamaica alſo, is one of the
ſwifteſt of the ſerpent kind. The Hoemorrhois, ſo called from the
hoemorrhages which its bite is ſaid to produce; the Seps, whoſe wound is
very venomous, and cauſes the part affected to corrupt in a very ſhort
time; the Coral Serpent, which is red, and whoſe bite is ſaid to be fatal.
But of all others, the Cobra <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0824000107:223"/> di Capello, or Hooded
Serpent, inflicts the moſt deadly and incurable wounds. Of this formidable
creature there are five or ſix different kinds; but they are all equally
dangerous, and their bite followed by ſpeedy and certain death. It is from
three to eight feet long, with two large fangs hanging out of the upper jaw. It
has a broad neck, and a mark of dark brown on the forehead; which, when viewed
frontwiſe, looks like a pair of ſpectacles; but behind, like the head of a
cat. The eyes are fierce, and full of fire; the head is ſmall, and the noſe
flat, though covered with very large ſcales, of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh aſh-colour;
the ſkin is white, and the large tumour on the neck is flat, and covered with
oblong, ſmooth ſcales. The bite of this animal is ſaid to be incurable,
the patient dying in about an hour after the wound; the whole frame being
diſſolved into one putrid maſs of corruption.</p>
               <p>To remedy the bite of all theſe animals, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſallad-oil
would be very efficacious: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Indians make uſe of a compoſition,
which is called, in Europe, Petro de Cobra, or the Serpent Stone; and which,
applied to the wound, is ſaid to draw out the venom. The compoſition of
this ſtone, for it is an artificial ſubſtance, is kept a ſecret; and
perhaps its <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0824000107:224"/> effects in extracting the venom may be
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary: nevertheleſs, it is certain that it has a power of ſticking to
the ſkin, and ſucking a part of the blood from the wound. This it may do
ſomewhat in the ſame manner as we ſee a tobacco-pipe ſtick to the lips
of a man who is ſmoking: yet ſtill we are ignorant of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and the
ſecret might probably be of ſome uſe in medicine. It were to be wiſhed,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that thoſe who go into India would examine into this
compoſition, and give us the reſult of their enquiries: but I fear that it
is not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit mankind, that our travellers now go to India.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. Of Serpents without Venom.</head>
               <p>THE claſs of ſerpents without poiſon, may be
diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are venomous, by their wanting the fang
teeth: their heads alſo are not ſo thick in proportion to their bodies;
and, in general, they taper off to the tail more gradually in a point. But
notwithſtanding their being deſtitute of venom, they do not ceaſe to be
formidable: ſome grow to a ſize by which they become the moſt powerful
animals of the foreſt; and even the ſmalleſt and moſt harmleſs of
this ſlender tribe, find protection from the ſimilitude of their form.</p>
               <p>The fangs make the great diſtinction among ſerpents; and all
this tribe are without them. Their teeth are ſhort, numerous, and, in the
ſmaller kinds, perfectly inoffenſive: they lie in either jaw, as in frogs
and fiſhes, their points bending backwards, the better to ſecure their
prey. They want that artificial mechaniſm by which the poiſonous tribe
inflict ſuch deadly wounds: they have no gland in the head for preparing
venom; no conduits for conveying it to the teeth; no receptables there; no
hollow <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0824000107:226"/> in the inſtrument that inflicts the wound.
Their bite, when the teeth happen to be large enough to penetrate the ſkin,
for in general they are too ſmall for this purpoſe, is attended with no
other ſymptoms than thoſe of an ordinary puncture; and many of this tribe,
as if ſenſible of their own impotence, cannot be provoked to bite, though
never ſo rudely aſſaulted. They hiſs, dart out their forky tongues,
erect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the tail, and call up all their terrors to intimidate
their aggreſſors; but ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their teeth as unneceſſary
inſtruments of defence, and never attempt to uſe them. Even among the
largeſt of this kind, the teeth are never employed, in the moſt deſperate
engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When a hare or a bird is caught, the teeth may ſerve to prevent
ſuch ſmall game from eſcaping; but when a buffalo or a tiger is to be
encountered, it is by the ſtrong folds of the body, by the fierce
verberations of the tail, that the enemy is deſtroyed: by this twining round,
and drawing the knot with convulſive energy, this enormous reptile breaks
every bone in the quadrupede's body, and then, at one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, devours its
prey.</p>
               <p>From hence we may diſtinguiſh the unve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous tribe into two
kinds: firſt, into thoſe which are ſeldom found of any conſiderable 
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0824000107:227"/> magnitude, and that never offend animals larger or more
powerful than themſelves, but which find their chief protection in flight, or
in the doubtfulneſs of their form; ſecondly, into ſuch as grow to an
enormous ſize, fear no enemy, but indiſcriminately attack all other animals
and devour them. Of the firſt kind is the Common Black Snake, the Blind Worm,
the Eſculapian Serpent, the Amphiſbaena, and ſeveral others. Of the
ſecond, the Lyboya, the Boiguacu, the Depona, and the Boiquatrara.</p>
               <p>The Black Snake is the largeſt of Engliſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
ſometimes exceeding four feet in length. The neck is ſlender; the middle of
the body thick; the back and ſides covered with ſmall ſcales; the belly
with oblong, narrow, tranſverſe plates: the colour of the back and ſides
are of a duſky brown; the middle of the back marked with two rows of ſmall
black ſpots, running from the head to the tail; the plates on the belly are
duſky; the ſcales on the ſides are of a bluiſh white: the teeth are
ſmall and ſerrated, lying on each ſide of the jaw in two rows. The whole
ſpecies is perfectly inoffenſive; taking ſhelter in dung hills, and among
buſhes in moiſt places; from whence they ſeldom remove, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the
midſt of the day, in ſummer, when they are called out by the heat to baſk
themſelves <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0824000107:228"/> in the ſun. If diſturbed or attacked,
they move away among the brambles with great ſwiftneſs; but if too
cloſely purſued, they hiſs and threaten, and thus render themſelves
formidable, though incapable of offending.</p>
               <p>The black ſnake preys upon frogs, inſects, worms, mice, and
young birds; and, conſidering the ſmallneſs of the neck, it is amazing
how large an animal it will ſwallow. The black ſnake of Virginia, which is
larger than our's, and generally grows to ſix feet long, takes a prey
proportionable to its ſize; partridges, chickens, and young ducks. It is
generally found in the neighbourhood of the hen rooſt, and will devour the
eggs even while the hen is ſitting upon them: theſe it ſwallows whole;
and often, after it has done the miſchief, will coil itſelf round in the
neſt.</p>
               <p>The whole of this tribe are oviparous, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding eighty or an
hundred eggs at a time, which are laid in dung-hills or hot-beds; the heat of
which, aided by that of the ſun, brings them to maturity. During winter they
lie tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, in banks of hedges, and under old trees.</p>
               <p>The Blind Worm is another harmleſs reptile, with a formidable
appearance. The uſual length of this ſpecies is eleven inches. The eyes are
red; the head ſmall; the neck ſtill more ſlender: <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0824000107:229"/>
from that part the body grows ſuddenly, and continues of an equal bulk to the
tail, which ends quite blunt: the colour of the back is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereous, marked with
very ſmall lines, compoſed of minute black ſpecks; the ſides are of a
red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh caſt; the belly duſky, and marked like the back. The motion of
this ſerpent is ſlow; from which, and from the ſmallneſs of the eyes,
are derived its names; ſome calling it the Slow, and ſome the Blind Worm.
Like all the reſt of the kind in our climates, they lie torpid during winter;
and are ſometimes found, in vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, twiſted together. This animal,
like the former, is perfectly innocent; however, like the viper, it brings
forth its young alive. Geſner tells us, that one of theſe being ſtruck on
the head when it was pregnant, it immediately caſt forth its young.</p>
               <p>The Amphiſbaena, or the Double Headed Serpent, is remarkable
for moving along with either the head or the tail foremoſt; and from thence
it has been thought to have two heads. This error took its riſe from the
thickneſs of the tail, which, at a diſtance, may be miſtaken for another
head. Upon a nearer view, however, the error is eaſily diſcovered, and the
animal will be found formed according to the uſual courſe of nature. It is
as thick at one end as <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0824000107:230"/> at the other; and the colour of
the ſkin is like that of the earth, being rough, hard, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
ſpotted. Some have affirmed that its bite is dangerous; but this muſt be a
miſtake, as it wants the fangs, and conſequently the ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratory that
prepares the poiſon.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals are only formidable from their ſimilitude to
the viper tribe; and, in ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where ſuch reptiles are common,
they make the diſtinction ſo exactly, that while they deſtroy ſerpents
of one kind with great ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, they take others into their houſes, and
even into their boſoms, with a kind of unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable affection. The
Eſculapian Serpent of Italy is among this number. It is there ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to
crawl about the chambers; and often gets into the beds where people lie. It is
a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſerpent, of about an ell long; and though innocent, yet will bite
when exaſperated. They are ſaid to be great deſtroyers of mice; and this
may be the reaſon why they are taken under human protection. The Boyuna of
Ceylon is equally a favourite among the natives; and they conſider the
meeting it as a ſign of good luck. The Surinam Serpent, which ſome
improperly call the Ammodytes, is equally harmleſs and deſirable among the
ſavages of that part of the world. They conſider themſelves as extremely 
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0824000107:231"/> happy if this animal comes into their huts. The colours
of this ſerpent are ſo many and beautiful, that they ſurpaſs all
deſcription; and theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are the chief inducements to the ſavages
to conſider its viſits as ſo very fortunate. A ſtill greater favourite
is the Prince of Serpents, a native of Japan, that has not its equal for
beauty. The ſcales which cover the back are reddiſh, finely ſhaded, and
marbled with large ſpots of irregular figures mixed with black. The fore part
of the head is covered with large beautiful ſcales, the jaws bordered with
yellow, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head marked with a black marbled ſtreak, and the eyes
handſome and lively. But of all others, the Gerenda of the Eaſt Indies is
the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and eſteemed. To this animal, which is finely ſpotted
with various colours, the natives of Calicut pay divine honours; and while
their deity lies coiled up, which is its uſual poſture, the people fall
upon their faces before it with ſtupid adoration. The African Gerenda is
larger, and worſhiped in the ſame manner, by the inhabitants of the
coaſts of Mozambique. The ſkin is not ſo finely ſpotted as the former;
but it is variegated all over the body with very fine white, aſh coloured,
and black ſpots. The brilliancy of colouring in theſe reptiles would only
ſerve with us to encreaſe our diſguſt; but <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0824000107:232"/> in
thoſe countries where they are, common diſtinctions are made; and even in
this horrid claſs, there are ſome eyes that can diſcover beauty.</p>
               <p>But in the larger tribe of ſerpents, there is nothing but
danger to be apprehended. This formidable claſs, though without venom, have
ſomething frightful in their colour, as well as their ſize and form. They
want that vivid hue with which the ſavages are ſo much pleaſed in the
leſſer kinds; they are all found of a duſky colour, with large teeth,
which are more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable than dangerous.</p>
               <p>The firſt of this claſs, is the Great Jiboya of Java and
Braſil, which Leguat affirms, he has ſeen fifty feet long. Nor is he
ſingular in this report, as many of the miſſionaries affirm the ſame;
and we have the concurrent teſtimony of hiſtorians as a further proof. The
largeſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal of this kind, which has been brought into Europe, is but
thirty-ſix feet long; and it is probable, that much greater have been ſeen
and deſtroyed, before they were thought worth ſending ſo far, to
ſatisfy European curioſity. The moſt uſual length, however, of the
jiboya, is about twenty feet, and the thickneſs in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. The teeth are
ſmall in proportion to <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0824000107:233"/> the body; nor are they uſed,
but when it ſeizes the ſmalleſt prey. It lies in wait for wild ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
near the paths, and when it throws itſelf upon them, it wraps them round ſo
cloſely as to break all the bones; then moiſtening the whole body over with
its ſlaver, it makes it fit for deglutition, and ſwallows it whole.</p>
               <p>The Boiguacu is ſuppoſed to be the next in magnitude, and
has often been ſeen to ſwallow a goat whole. It is thickeſt in the middle
of the body, and grows ſhorter and ſmaller towards the head and the tail:
on the middle of the back, there is a chain of ſmall black ſpots running
along the length of it; and on each ſide, there are large round black
ſpots, at ſome diſtance from each other, which are white in the center:
between theſe, near the belly, there are two rows of leſſer black
ſpots, which run parallel to the back. It has a double row of ſharp teeth
in each jaw, of a white colour, and ſhining like mother-of pearl. The head is
broad; and over the eyes it is raiſed into two prominences: near the
extremity of the tail there are two claws, reſembling thoſe of birds.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſerpents lie hid in thickets, from whence they ſally
out unawares, and raiſing themſelves upright on their tails, will attack
both men and <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0824000107:234"/> beaſts. They make a loud hiſſing
noiſe when exaſperated; and ſometimes winding up trees, will dart down
upon travellers, and twiſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo cloſely round their bodies,
as to diſpatch them in a very few minutes. Condamine, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, affirms, that
their bite is not dangerous; for though the teeth are ſo large, as to
inſpire the beholder with terror, yet the wound they make is attended with no
dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences whatever. Dellon affirms, that they generally haunt
deſart places; and though they are ſometimes ſeen near great towns, or on
the banks of rivers, yet it is generally after ſome great inundation: he
never ſaw any but what were dead; and they appeared to him, like the trunk of
a great tree lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>To this claſs of large ſerpents, we may refer the Depona, a
native of Mexico, with a very large head and great jaws. The mouth is armed
with cutting, crooked teeth, among which there are two longer than the reſt,
placed in the fore part of the upper jaw, but very different from the fangs of
the viper. All round the mouth there is a broad ſcaly border; and the eyes
are ſo large, that they give it a very terrible aſpect. The forehead is
covered with very large ſcales; <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0824000107:235"/> on which are placed
others, that are ſmaller, curiouſly ranged: thoſe on the back are
greyiſh, and along it runs a double chain, whoſe ends are joined in the
manner of a buckler. Each ſide of the belly is marbled with large ſquare
ſpots, of a cheſnut colour; in the middle of which is a ſpot, which is
round and yellow. They avoid the ſight of man; and conſequently, never do
much harm.</p>
               <p>Such are the moſt noted animals of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent tribe: but
to recount all, would be a vain, as well as a uſeleſs endeavour. In thoſe
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they abound, their diſcriminations are ſo numerous, and
their colours ſo various, that every thicket ſeems to produce a new
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. The ſame ſerpent is often found to bring forth animals of eight or
ten different colours: and the naturaliſt who attempts to arrange them by
that mark, will find that he has made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions which are entirely
diſowned by Nature: however, a very conſiderable number might be added to
enlarge the catalogue; but having ſupplied a general hiſtory, the mind
turns away from a ſubject where every object preſents ſomething
formidable or loathſome to the imagination. Indeed, the whole tribe
reſemble each other ſo nearly, that the hiſtory of one 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0824000107:236"/> may almoſt ſerve for every other. They are all
terrible to the imagination, all frightful to behold in their fury, and have
long been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a race of animals between whom and man there is a
natural antipathy.</p>

                  <head>Of Inſects in general.</head>
                  <p>HAVING gone through the upper ranks of nature, we deſcend to
that of inſects, a ſubject almoſt inexhauſtible from the number of its
tribes and the variety of their appearance. Thoſe who have profeſſedly
written on this ſubject ſeem to conſider it as one of the greateſt that
can occupy the human mind, as the moſt pleaſing in animated nature. 
<q rend="inline">"After an attentive examination," ſays
Swammerdam, "of the nature and anatomy of the ſmalleſt as well as the
largeſt animals, I cannot help al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the leaſt an equal, or perhaps a
ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, degree of dignity. If, while we diſſect with care the larger
animals, we are filled <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0824000107:239"/> with wonder at the elegant
diſpoſition of their parts, to what an height is our aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
raiſed, when we diſcover all theſe parts arranged in the leaſt in the
ſame regular manner! Notwithſtanding the ſmallneſs of ants, nothing
hinders our preferring them to the largeſt animals. If we conſider either
their unwearied diligence, their wonderful ſtrength, or their inimitable
propenſity to labour. Their amazing love to their young is ſtill more
unparalleled among the larger claſſes. They not only daily carry them to
ſuch places as may afford them food; but if by accident they are killed, and
even cut into pieces, they, with the utmoſt tenderneſs, will carry them
away piecemeal in their arms. Who can ſhew ſuch an example among the larger
animals, which are dignified with the title of perfect? Who can find an
inſtance in any other creature that can come in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with
this?"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is the language of a man who by long ſtudy became
enamoured of his ſubject; but to thoſe who judge leſs partially, it will
be found that the inſect tribe, for every reaſon, deſerve but the laſt
and loweſt rank in animated nature. As in mechanics the moſt complicated
machines are required to perform the niceſt operations, ſo in 
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0824000107:240"/> anatomy the nobleſt animals are moſt variouſly and
wonderfully made. Of all living beings, man offers the moſt wonderful variety
in his internal conformation; quadrupedes come next; and other animals follow
in proportion to their powers or their excellencies. Inſects ſeem of all
others the moſt imperfectly formed: from their minuteneſs, the
diſſecting knife can go but a ſhort way in the inveſtigation; but one
thing argues an evident imperfection, which is, that many of them can live a
long time, though deprived of thoſe organs which are neceſſary to life in
the higher ranks of nature. Many of them are furniſhed with lungs and an
heart like nobler animals; yet the caterpillar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to live, though its
heart and lungs, which is often the caſe, are entirely eaten away.</p>
                  <p>But it is not from their conformation alone that inſects are
inferior to other animals, but from their inſtincts alſo. It is true, that
the ant and the bee preſent us with very ſtriking inſtances of
aſſiduity; but how far are theirs beneath the marks of ſagacity exhibited
in the hound or the ſtag! A bee taken from the ſwarm is totally helpleſs
and inactive, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of giving the ſmalleſt variation to its
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts: it has but one ſingle method of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, and, if put from
that, it can turn to <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0824000107:241"/> no other. In the purſuits of the
hound, there is ſomething like a choice; in the labours of the bee, the whole
appears like neceſſity or compulſion.</p>
                  <p>If inſects be conſidered as bearing a relation to man, and
as aſſiſting him in the pleaſures or neceſſities of life, they
will, even in this reſpect, ſink in the compariſon with the larger tribes
of nature. It is true, that the bee, the ſilk-worm, the cochineal fly, and
the cantharides, render him ſignal ſervices; but how many others of this
claſs, are either noxious, or totally unſerviceable to him. Even in a
country like ours, where all the noxious animals have been reduced by repeated
aſſiduity, the inſect tribes ſtill maintain their ground, and are but
too often unwelcome intruders upon the fruits of human induſtry. But in more
uncultivated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, their annoyance and devaſtations are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. What
an uncomfortable life muſt the natives lead in Lapland, and ſome parts of
America, where, if a candle be lighted, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects ſwarm in ſuch
abundance, as inſtantly to extinguiſh it with their numbers; where the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are obliged to ſmear their bodies and faces with tar, or ſome
other compoſition, to protect them from-the puncture of their minute enemies;
where, though millions are deſtroyed, <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0824000107:242"/> famiſhed
millions are ſtill ſeen to ſucceed, and to make the torture
endleſs!</p>
                  <p>Their amazing number is alſo an argument of their
imperfection. It is a rule that obtains through all nature, that the nobler
animals are ſlowly produced, and that nature acts with a kind of dignified
economy; but the meaner births are laviſhed in profuſion, and thouſands
are brought forth merely to ſupply the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the more favourite
objects of creation. Of all other productions in nature, inſects are the
moſt numerous. Vegetables that cover the ſurface of the earth bear no
proportion to their multitudes; and though at firſt ſight herbs of the
field ſeem to be the parts of organized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture produced in the greateſt
abundance, yet, upon minuter inſpection, we ſhall find every plant
ſupporting a number of ſcarce perceptible creatures, that fill up the
various ſtages of youth, vigour, and age, in the compaſs of a few days
exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>All other animals are capable of ſome degree of education;
their inſtincts may be ſuppreſſed or altered; the dog may be taught to
fetch and carry; the bird to whiſtle a tune; and the ſerpent to dance: but
the inſect has but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable method of operating; no arts can turn it
from its inſtincts; and indeed its life is too <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0824000107:243"/> ſhort
for inſtruction, as a ſingle ſeaſon often terminates its
exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>For theſe reaſons, the inſect tribe are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
placed in the loweſt rank of animated nature; and, in general, they ſeem
more allied to the vegetables on which they feed than to the nobler claſſes
above them. Many of them are attached to one vegetable, often to a ſingle
leaf; there they encreaſe with the flouriſhing plant, and die as it decays;
a few days fill up the meaſure of their contemptible lives; while the ends
for which they were produced, or the pleaſures they enjoyed, to us at
leaſt, are utterly unknown.</p>
                  <p>Yet while I am thus fixing the rank of a certain claſs of
animals, it ſeems neceſſary to define the nature of thoſe animals which
are thus degraded. Definitions in general produce little knowledge; but here
where the ſhades of nature are ſo intimately blended, ſome
diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is neceſſary to prevent confuſion. The ſmallneſs of
the animal, for inſtance, does not conſtitute an inſect; for then, many
of the lizard kind, which are not above two inches long, would come under this
denomination; and if the ſmaller lizards, why not the crocodile, which would
be a terrible inſect indeed? In the ſame manner, ſmallneſs, with a
ſlow creeping <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0824000107:244"/> motion, does not conſtitute an
inſect; for, though ſnails might be called inſects with the ſame
propriety, the whole tribe of ſea ſhell-fiſh would then have equal
pretenſions, and a very troubleſome innovation would be brought into our
language, which is already formed. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding ſuch animals, therefore, from
the inſect tribe, we may define inſects to be <hi>little animals without
red blood, bones or cartilages, furniſhed with a trunk, or elſe a mouth,
opening lengthwiſe, with eyes which they are incapable of covering, and with
lungs which have their openings on the ſides.</hi> This definition
comprehends the whole claſs of inſects, whether with or without wings,
whether in their caterpillar or butterfly ſtate, whether produced in the
ordinary method of generation between male and female, or from an animal that
is itſelf both male and female, or from the ſame animal cut into ſeveral
parts, and each part reproducing a perfect animal.</p>
                  <p>From hence it appears, that in this claſs of animals there
are numerous diſtinctions, and that a general deſcription will by no means
ſerve for all. Almoſt every ſpecies has its own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct hiſtory;
and exhibits manners, appetites, and modes of propagation, peculiarly its own.
In the larger ranks of exiſtence, two animals that nearly reſemble each
other in form will be <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0824000107:245"/> found to have a ſimilar
hiſtory; but here inſects almoſt entirely alike will be often found
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſſimilar, as well in their manner of bringing forth and
ſubſiſting as in the changes which they undergo during their ſhort
lives. Thus as this claſs is prolific beyond computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo are its
varieties multiplied beyond the power of deſcription. The attempt to
enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all the ſpecies of a fly or a moth would be very fruitleſs; but
to give an hiſtory of all would be utterly impracticable; ſo various are
the appetites, the manners, and the lives of this humble claſs of beings,
that every ſpecies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires its diſtinct hiſtory. An exact plan,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of Nature's operations in this minute ſet of creatures is not to
be expected; and yet ſuch a general picture may be given, as is ſufficient
to ſhew the protection which Providence affords its ſmalleſt as well as
its largeſt productions, and to diſplay that admirable circulation in
nature by which one ſet of living beings find ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence from the
deſtruction of another; and by which life is continued without a pauſe in
every part of the creation.</p>
                  <p>Upon caſting a ſlight view over the whole inſect tribe
juſt when they are ſuppoſed to rouze from their ſtate of annual
torpidity, when they begin to feel the genial influence of ſpring, and again
exhibit new life in every part of nature, <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0824000107:246"/> their numbers
and their varieties ſeem to exceed all powers of calculation, and they are
indeed too great for deſcription. When we look cloſer, however, we ſhall
find ſome ſtriking ſimilitudes, either in their propagation, their
manners, or their form, that give us a hint for grouping ſeveral of them into
one deſcription, and thus enabling us to ſhorten the labour of a ſeparate
hiſtory for every ſpecies. Swammerdam, Reau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, and Linnaeus, have each
attempted to abridge the taſk of deſcription, by throwing a number of
ſimilar animals into diſtinct claſſes, and thus making one general
hiſtory ſtand for all. I will avail myſelf of their labours; and uniting
their general diſtinctions, throw the whole claſs of inſects into four
ſeparate diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, giving under each the hiſtory of every ſpecies
that ſeems to me conſiderable enough to deſerve our notice. Thus our
labour will be ſhortened; and the very rank in which an inſect is placed
will, in ſome meaſure, exhibit a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of its hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>In our curſory inſpection of the inſect tribe, the
firſt animals that offer themſelves are thoſe which want wings, that
appear crawling about on every plant, and on every ſpot of earth we regard
with any degree of attention. Of theſe, ſome never obtain wings at any
period of their <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0824000107:247"/> exiſtence, but are deſtined to creep
on the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, or the ſpot of earth where they are ſtationed, for their
whole lives. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, others are only candidates for a more happy
ſituation; and only wait their growing wings, when they may be ſaid to
arrive at their ſtate of full perfection.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that never have wings, but creep about till they die,
may be conſidered as conſtituting the <hi>firſt</hi> claſs of
inſects. All theſe, the flea and the wood-louſe only excepted, are
produced from an egg; and when once they break the ſhell, they never ſuffer
any further change of form, but continue to grow larger till they die. Thus the
louſe or the ſpider are produced from an egg, never ſuffering any
alteration when once they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; but, like the chicken or the duck,
remaining invariably the ſame, from their birth to their diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond order of inſects conſiſts of ſuch as have
wings; but which, when produced from the egg, have thoſe wings caſed up in
ſuch a manner as not to appear. This caſing up of the wing, however, does
not prevent the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's running, leaping, and moving with its natural
celerity; but when the caſe burſts, and the wings have a power of
expanding, all <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0824000107:248"/> the animal's motions become more
extenſive, and the animal arrives at full perfection. Thus the graſshopper,
the dragon fly, and the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig, have their wings at firſt bound down; but
when the ſkin that, like a pair of ſtays, kept them confined, burſts,
they are then expanded, and the animal purſues the purpoſes for which it
was produced.</p>
                  <p>The third order of inſects is of the moth and butterfly
kind. Theſe all have four wings, each covered with a mealy ſubſtance of
various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which when handled comes off upon the fingers; and, if
examined by the microſcope, will appear like ſcales, with which the wing is
nicely embroidered all over. Theſe inſects alſo are produced in a manner
peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They are firſt hatched from an egg, from whence
proceeds a caterpillar that eats, and often caſts its ſkin; the caterpillar
having diveſted itſelf for the laſt time, aſſumes a new covering,
which is called a chryſalis, or the cone in the ſilk-worm, in which it
continues hidden till it comes forth a perfect moth or butterfly.</p>
                  <p>The fourth order is of thoſe winged inſects which come
from a worm inſtead of a cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar, and yet go through changes ſimilar
to <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0824000107:249"/> thoſe which moths and butterflies are ſeen to
undergo. They are firſt excluded from the egg as a worm, and then become a
chryſalis; in ſome, their wings and legs are ſeen; in others, the animal
is quite detached from the cone in which it is concealed; but all at length
break their priſon, and come out perfect winged ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; ſome furniſhed
with two wings and ſome with four. The wings of all theſe differ from
thoſe of the butterfly and moth kind, by not having the mealy ſcales which
are ever found on the wings of the former. In this claſs we may place the
numerous tribes of gnats, beetles, bees, and flies.</p>
                  <p>To theſe I will add, as a fifth order, a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous tribe
lately diſcovered, to which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts have given the name of Zoophytes.
Theſe do not go through the ordinary forms of generation, but may be
propagated by diſſection. Some of theſe, though cut into an hundred
parts, ſtill retain life in each, and are endued with ſuch a vivacious
principle, that every part will in a ſhort time become a perfect animal. They
ſeem a ſet of creatures placed between animals and vegetables, and make the
ſhade that connects animated and inſenſible nature. To this claſs
belong the polypus, the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, and all the varieties of the
ſea-nettle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0824000107:250"/>Having thus given a general
diſtribution of inſects, I will poceed to deſcribe each claſs in the
order I have mentioned them; beginning with inſects without wings, as they
more nearly reſemble the higher ranks of nature, as well in their habits as
their conformation.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of Inſects without Wings.</head>
                  <p>EVERY moment's obſervation furniſhes us with inſtances
of inſects without wings; but the difficulty is to diſtinguiſh thoſe
which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned continually to lead reptile lives, from ſuch as only
wait the happy moment of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation. For this, nothing but a long and
intimate acquaintance will ſuffice; but, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, all animals
reſembling the flea, the louſe, the ſpider, the bug, the wood-louſe,
the water-louſe, and the ſcorpion, never acquire wings, but are produced
from the egg in that form which they never change afterwards.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider this claſs as diſtinct from others, we
ſhall find them in general longer lived than the reſt, and often continuing
their term beyond one ſeaſon, which is the ordinary period of an inſect's
exiſtence. They ſeem alſo leſs ſubject to the influence of the
weather; and often endure the rigours of winter without being numbed into
torpidity. The whole race of moths, butterflies, bees, and flies, are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
lifeleſs by the return of cold weather; but we need not be told, that the
louſe, the flea, <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0824000107:252"/> and many of theſe wingleſs
creatures that ſeem formed to teize mankind, continue their painful
depredations the whole year round.</p>
                  <p>They come to perfection in the egg, as was ſaid before; and
it ſometimes happens, that when the animal is interrupted in performing the
offices of excluſion, the young ones burſt the ſhell within the parent's
body, and are thus brought forth alive. This not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens with the
wood-louſe, and others of the kind, which are ſometimes ſeen producing
eggs, and ſometimes young ones perfectly formed.</p>
                  <p>Though theſe creatures are perfect from the beginning, yet
they are often, during their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, ſeen to change their ſkin: this
is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which they poſſeſs in common with many of the higher ranks
of animals, and which anſwers the ſame purpoſes. However tender their
ſkins may ſeem to our feel, yet, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the animal's ſtrength
and ſize, they will be found to reſemble a coat of mail or, to talk more
cloſely, the ſhell of a lobſter. By this ſkin theſe animals are
defended from accidental injuries, and particularly from the attacks of each
other. Within this they continue to grow, till their bodies become ſo large
as to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in their own covering, and then the 
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0824000107:253"/> ſhell burſts, but is quickly replaced by a new
one.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, theſe animals are endued with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of
ſtrength for their ſize, that at firſt might exceed
credibility.—Had man an equal degree of ſtrength, bulk for bulk, with a
louſe or flea, the hiſtory of Samſon would be no longer
miraculous.—A flea will draw a chain an hundred times heavier than
itſelf; and to compenſate for this force, will eat ten times its own ſize
of proviſion in a ſingle day.</p>

                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0824000107:255"/>THE animal that deſerves our firſt
notice in this principal order of inſects is the ſpider, whoſe manners
are of all others the moſt ſubtle, and whoſe inſtincts are moſt
various. Formed for a life of rapacity, and incapable of living upon any other
than inſect food, all its habits are calculated to deceive and ſurprize; it
ſpreads toils to entangle its prey; it is endued with patience to expect its
coming; and is poſſeſſed of arms and ſtrength to deſtroy it when
fallen into the ſnare.</p>
                  <p>In this country, where all the inſect tribes are kept under
by human aſſiduity, the ſpiders are but ſmall and harmleſs. We are
acquainted with few, but the houſe-ſpider, which weaves its web in
neglected rooms; the garden-ſpider, that ſpreads its toils from tree to
tree, and reſts in the center; the wandering-ſpider, that has no abode like
the reſt; and the field ſpider, that is ſometimes ſeen mounting, web
and all, into the clouds. Theſe are the chief of our native ſpiders; which,
though reputed venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are entirely inoffenſive. But they form 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0824000107:256"/> a much more terrible tribe in Africa and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. In
thoſe regions, where all the inſect ſpecies acquire their greateſt
growth, where the butterfly is ſeen to expand a wing as broad as our
ſparrow, and the ant to build an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as tall as a man, it is not to
be wondered at that the ſpiders are ſeen bearing a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
magnitude. In fact, the bottom of the Martinico ſpider's body is as large as
a hen's egg, and covered all over with hair. Its web is ſtrong, and its bite
dangerous. It is happy for us, however, that we are placed at a diſtance from
theſe formidable creatures, and that we can examine their hiſtory without
feeling their reſentment.</p>
                  <p>Every ſpider has two diviſions in its body. The fore-part,
containing the head and breaſt, is ſeparated from the hinder part or belly
by a very ſlender thread, through which, however, there is communication from
one part to the other. The fore part is covered with a hard ſhell, as well as
the legs, which adhere to the breaſt. The hinder part is cloathed with a
ſupple ſkin, beſet all over with hair. They have ſeveral eyes all round
the head, brilliant and acute; theſe are ſometimes eight in number,
ſometimes but ſix; two behind, two before, and the reſt on each ſide.
Like <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0824000107:257"/> all other inſects, their eyes are immoveable; and
they want eye-lids; but this organ is fortified with a tranſparent horny
ſubſtance, which at once ſecures and aſſiſts their viſion. As the
animal procures its ſubſiſtence by the moſt watchful attention, ſo
large a number of eyes was neceſſary to give it the earlieſt information
of the capture of its prey. They have two pincers on the fore-part of the head,
rough, with ſtrong points, toothed like a ſaw, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in claws
like thoſe of a cat. A little below the point of the claw there is a ſmall
hole, through which the animal emits a poiſon, which, though harmleſs to
us, is ſufficiently capable of inſtantly deſtroying its prey. This is the
moſt powerful weapon they have againſt their enemies; they can open or
extend theſe pincers as occaſion may require; and when they are
undiſturbed, they ſuffer them to lie one upon the other, never opening them
but when there is a neceſſity for their exertion. They have all eight legs,
jointed like thoſe of lobſters, and ſimilar alſo in another reſpect;
for if a leg be torn away, or a joint cut off, a new one will quickly grow in
its place, and the animal will find itſelf fitted for combat as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. At
the end of each leg there are three crooked moveable claws; namely, a ſmall
one, <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0824000107:258"/> placed higher up, like a cock's ſpur, by the
aſſiſtance of which it adheres to the threads of its web. There are two
others larger, which meet together like a lobſter's claw, by which they can
catch hold of the ſmalleſt depreſſions, walking up or down the very
poliſhed ſurfaces, on which they can find inequalities that are
imperceptible to our groſſer ſight. But when they walk upon ſuch bodies
as are perfectly ſmooth, as looking glaſs or poliſhed marble, they
ſqueeze a little ſponge, which grows near the extremity of their claws, and
thus diffuſing a glutinous ſubſtance, adhere to the ſurface until they
make a ſecond ſtep. Beſides the eight legs juſt mentioned, theſe
animals have two others, which may more properly be called arms, as they do not
ſerve to aſſiſt motion, but are uſed in holding and managing their
prey.</p>
                  <p>The ſpider, though thus formidably equipped, would ſeldom
prove ſucceſsful in the capture, were it not equally furniſhed with other
inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to aſſiſt its depredations. As it lives wholly upon flies,
and is without wings to purſue them, it is obvious they muſt for ever
eſcape ſo impotent an adverſary; but the ſpider is a moſt experienced
hunter, and ſpreads its nets to catch thoſe animals it is unable to
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. The ſpider's web is generally laid in thoſe 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0824000107:259"/> places where flies are moſt apt to come and ſhelter;
in the corners of rooms, round the edges of windows, and in the open air among
the branches of trees. There the little animal remains for days, nay weeks
together, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient expectation, ſeldom changing its ſituation though
never ſo unſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>For the purpoſes of making this web, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has ſupplied
this animal with a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of glutinous matter within its body, and
five dugs or teats for ſpinning it into thread. This ſubſtance is
contained in a little bag, and at firſt ſight it reſembles ſoft glue;
but when examined more accurately, it will be found twiſted into many coils
of an agate colour, and upon breaking it, the contents may be eaſily drawn
out into threads, from the tenacity of the ſubſtance, not from thoſe
threads being already formed. Thoſe who have ſeen the machine by which wire
is ſpun, will have an idea of the manner in which this animal forms the
threads of its little net, the orifices of the five teats above-mentioned,
through which the thread is drawn, contracting or dilating at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The
threads which we ſee, and appear ſo fine, are, notwithſtanding,
compoſed of five joined together, and theſe are many times doubled when the
web is in formation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0824000107:260"/>When a houſe-ſpider propoſes to
begin a web, it firſt makes choice of ſome commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſpot, where there
is an appearance of plunder and ſecurity. The animal then diſtils one
little drop of its glutinous liquor, which is very tenacious, and then creeping
up the wall, and joining its thread as it proceeds, it darts itſelf in a very
ſurpriſing manner, as I have often ſeen, to the oppoſite place, where
the other end of the web is to be faſtened. The firſt thread thus formed,
drawn tight, and fixed at each end, the ſpider then runs upon it backward and
forward, ſtill aſſiduouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in doubling and ſtrengthening
it, as upon its force depends the ſtrength and ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the whole. The
ſcaffolding thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, the ſpider makes a number of threads parallel
to the firſt, in the ſame manner, and then croſſes them with others;
the clammy ſubſtance of which they are formed, ſerving to bind them, when
newly made, to each other. The inſect, after this operation, doubles and
trebles the thread that borders its web, by opening all its teats at once, and
ſecures the edges, ſo as to prevent the wind from blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work away.
The edges being thus fortified, the retreat is next to be attended to; and this
is formed like a funnel at the bottom <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0824000107:261"/> of the web, where
the little creature lies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. To this are two paſſages, or outlets,
one above and the other below, very artfully contrived, to give the animal an
opportunity of making excurſions at proper ſeaſons, of pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into every
corner, and cleaning thoſe parts which are obſerved to be clogged or
encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered. Still attentive to its web, the ſpider, from time to time,
cleans away the duſt that gathers round it, which might otherwiſe clog and
incommode it: for this purpoſe, it gives the whole a ſhake with its paws;
ſtill, however, proportioning the blow ſo as not to endanger the fabric. It
often happens alſo, that from the main web there are ſeveral threads
extended at ſome diſtance on every ſide: theſe are, in ſome
meaſure, the outworks of the fortification, which, whenever touched from
without, the ſpider prepares for attack or ſelf-defence. If the inſect
impinging be a fly, it ſprings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with great agility; if, on the
contrary, it be the aſſault of an enemy ſtronger than itſelf, it keeps
within its fortreſs, and never ventures out till the danger be over. Another
advantage which the ſpider reaps from this contrivance of a cell or retreat
behind the web, is, that it ſerves for a place where the creature 
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0824000107:262"/> can feaſt upon its game with all ſafety, and conceal
the fragments of thoſe carcaſſes which it has picked, without expoſing
to public view the leaſt trace of barbarity, that might create a
ſuſpicion in any inſects that their enemy was near.</p>
                  <p>It often happens, however, that the wind, or the ruſtling of
the branches, or the approach of ſome large animal, deſtroys in a minute
the labours of an age. In this caſe, the ſpider is obliged to remain a
patient ſpectator of the univerſal ruin; and when the danger is paſſed
away, it ſets about repairing the calamity. For this purpoſe, it is
furniſhed with a large ſtore of the glutinous ſubſtance of which the
web is made; and with this, it either makes a new web, or patches up the old
one. In general, however, the animal is much fonder of mending than making, as
it is furniſhed originally with but a certain quantity of glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous matter,
which, when exhauſted, nothing can renew. The time ſeldom fails to come,
when their reſervoirs are entirely dried up, and the poor animal is left to
all the chances of irretrievable neceſſity. An old ſpider is thus
frequently reduced to the greateſt extremity; its web is deſtroyed, and it
wants the materials <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0824000107:263"/> to make a new one. But as theſe
animals have been long accuſtomed to a life of ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it hunts about to
find out the web of another ſpider, younger and weaker than itſelf, with
whom it ventures a battle. The invader generally ſucceds; the young one is
driven out to make a new web, and the old one remains in quiet
poſſeſſion. If, however, the ſpider is unable to diſpoſſeſs
any other of its web, it then endeavours, for a while, to ſubſiſt upon
accidental depredation; but in two or three months it inevitably dies of
hunger.</p>
                  <p>The garden-ſpider ſeems to work in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner.
The method with this inſect is to ſpin a great quantity of thread, which
floating in the air in various directions, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens from its glutinous quality,
at laſt to ſtick to ſome object near it, a lofty plant or the branch of a
tree. The ſpider only wants to have one end of the line faſt, in order to
ſecure and tighten the other. It accordingly draws the line when thus fixed,
and then by paſſing and repaſſing upon it, ſtrengthens the thread in
ſuch a manner as to anſwer, all its intentions. The firſt cord being thus
ſtretched, the ſpider walks along a part of it, and there faſtens
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and dropping from thence, faſtens the thread to ſome ſolid body
below, then climbs <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0824000107:264"/> up again and begins a third, which it
faſtens by the ſame contrivance. When three threads are thus fixed, it
forms a ſquare, or ſomething that very nearly reſembles one; and in this
the animal is generally ſeen to reſide. It often happens, however, when the
young ſpider begins ſpinning, that its web becomes too buoyant, and not
only the thread floats in the air, but even the little ſpinſter. In this
manner we have often ſeen the threads of ſpiders floating in the air; and
what is ſtill more ſurprizing, the young ſpiders themſelves attached to
their own web. The reaſon is obvious; for as even gold itſelf may be ſo
finely drawn out as to float in the air, ſo the finer thread of a ſpider is
ſo buoyant as not only to ſwim in the air, but alſo to lift the ſpider
itſelf; which, like the tail of a kite, riſes with its own manufacture.</p>
                  <p>The ſpider's web being thus compleated, and fixed in a
proper place, its next care is to ſeize and ſecure whatever inſect
happens to be caught in the toil. For this purpoſe, it remains for weeks and
even months upon the watch, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever catching a ſingle fly; for the
ſpider, like moſt other inſects, is ſurprizingly patient of hunger. It
ſometimes happens that too ſtrong a fly ſtrikes itſelf againſt the
web, and <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0824000107:265"/> thus, inſtead of being caught, tears the net
to pieces. In general, however, the butterfly or the hornet, when they touch
the web, fly off again, and the ſpider ſeems no way diſpoſed to
interrupt their retreat. The large blue-bottle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly, the ichneumon-fly, and the
common meat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly; ſeem to be its favourite game. When one of theſe ſtrike
into the toils, the ſpider is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeen alert and watchful at the
mouth of its hole, careful to obſerve whether the fly be compleatly
immeſhed. If that be the caſe, the ſpider walks leiſurely forward,
ſeizes its prey, and inſtantly kills it by inſtilling a venomous juice
into the wound it makes. If, however, the fly be not entirely immeſhed, the
ſpider patiently waits, without appearing until its prey has fatigued
itſelf by its ſtruggles to obtain its liberty; for if the ravager ſhould
appear in all his terrors while the prey is but half involved, a deſperate
effort might give it force enough to get free. If the ſpider has faſted for
a long time, it then drags the fly immediately into its hole and devours it;
but if there has been plenty of game, and the animal be no way preſſed by
hunger, it then gives the fly two or three turns in its web, ſo as compleatly
to immeſh it, and there leaves it impotently to ſtruggle until the little
tyrant comes to its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0824000107:266"/> Why the ſpider ſhould
at one time kill its prey, and at another ſuffer it to ſtruggle in the
toils for ſeveral hours together, I am not able to ſay; perhaps it only
likes its prey newly killed, and therefore delays to put the captive to death
until it is to be eaten.</p>
                  <p>It has been the opinion of ſome philoſophers, that the
ſpider was in itſelf both male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; but Liſter has been able to
diſtinguiſh the ſexes, and to perceive that the males were much leſs in
ſize than the females. But this is not the chief peculiarity; for, different
from all other animals, except the fiſh called the Ray, it has its
inſtruments of generation placed in the fore-arms, which have been already
deſcribed. When theſe animals copulate, they for ſome time teize each
other with their legs and arms, then appear the inſtruments of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in
the male, as if burſting out from the points of its fore-feet, and are
inſerted into the receptacle beneath the body of the female.</p>
                  <p>The female generally lays from nine hundred to a thouſand
eggs in a ſeaſon; they are of a bluiſh colour, ſpeckled with black, and
ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from each other by a glutinous ſubſtance, not unlike frog
ſpawn water. Theſe eggs are large or ſmall in proportion to the ſize of
the animal that produces them. In ſome they are <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0824000107:267"/> as
large as a grain of muſtard-ſeed; in others, they are ſcarcely viſible.
The female never begins to lay till ſhe be two years old at the leaſt, and
her firſt brood is never ſo numerous as when ſhe has come to her
greateſt maturity.</p>
                  <p>When the number of eggs which the ſpider has brought forth
have remained for an hour or two to dry after excluſion, the little animal
then prepares to make them a bag, where they are to be hatched until they leave
the ſhell. For this purpoſe, ſhe ſpins a web four or five times
ſtronger than that made for catching flies; and beſides, lines it within
ſide by a down, which ſhe plucks from her own breaſt. This bag, when
compleated, is as thick as paper, is ſmooth within ſide, but rougher
without. Within this they depoſit their eggs; and it is almoſt incredible
to relate the concern and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry which they beſtow in the preſervation
of it. They ſtick it by means of their glutinous fluid to the end of their
body; ſo that the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, when thus loaded, appears as if ſhe had one body
placed behind another. If this bag be ſeparated from her by any accident,
ſhe employs all her aſſiduity to ſtick it again in its former
ſituation, and ſeldom abandons her treaſure but with her life. When the
young ones are excluded from their ſhells, within the <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0824000107:268"/>
bag, they remain for ſome time in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, until the female,
inſtinctively knowing their maturity, bites open their priſon, and ſets
them free. But her parental care does not terminate with their excluſion;
ſhe receives them upon her back for ſome time, until they have ſtrength
to provide for themſelves, when they leave her never to return, and each
begins a ſeparate manufactory of its own. The young ones begin to ſpin when
they can ſcarcely be diſcerned; and prepare for a life of plunder before
they have ſtrength to overcome. Indeed, Nature ſeems to have formed them in
every reſpect for a life of hoſtility. No other inſect is
poſſeſſed of ſuch various powers of aſſault and defence; and they
are able to deſtroy animals ten times bigger than themſelves. Even after a
ſevere defeat, they quickly recover of their wounds; and as for their legs,
they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the loſs of them as but a ſmall misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as they grow
again very ſpeedily to their former magnitude.</p>
                  <p>Thus there is no inſect to which they are not an enemy; but
what is more barbarous ſtill, ſpiders are the enemies of each other. Mr.
Reaumur, who was fond of making expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments upon inſects, tried to turn the
labours of the ſpider to human advantage, and actually <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0824000107:269"/>
made a pair of gloves from their webs. For this purpoſe, he collected a large
number of thoſe inſects together: he took care to have them conſtantly
ſupplied with flies, and the ends of young feathers, freſh picked from
chickens and pigeons, which being full of blood, are a diet that ſpiders are
particularly fond of. But notwithſtanding all his care, he was ſoon
convinced that it was impracticable to rear them, ſince they were of ſuch a
malignant nature, that they could never be brought to live in ſociety; but
inſtead of their uſual food, choſe to devour each other. Indeed, were it
practicable to reconcile them to each other, it would require too much
attendance to rear up a ſufficient number to make the project any way
uſeful. Their thread is four, if not five times finer than that of the
ſilk-worm; ſo that upon the ſmalleſt calculation, there muſt have
been ſixty thouſand ſpiders to make a ſingle pound of ſilk. That
which Reaumur made uſe of, was only the web in which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited their
eggs, which is five times ſtronger than their ordinary manufacture.</p>
                  <p>Of this animal, there are ſeveral kinds, ſlightly
differing from each other, either in habits or conformation. The Water-ſpider
is the moſt remarkable of the number. This inſect <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0824000107:270"/>
reſembles the common ſpider in its appearance, except that its hinder part
is made rather in the ſhape of a nine-pin than a ball. They differ in being
able to live as well by land as water; and in being capable of ſpinning as
well in one element as the other. Their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance under water is very
remarkable; for though they inhabit the bottom, yet they are never touched by
the element in which they reſide, but are encloſed in a bubble of air that,
like a box, ſurrounds them on every ſide. This bubble has the bright
appearance, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, of quickſilver; and within this, they perform
their ſeveral functions of eating, ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſleeping, without its
ever burſting, or in the leaſt diſturbing their operations: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
the bubble is ſeen divided into three diſtinct apartments; and in the
ſpring, the male enters one of thoſe to impregnate the female, in the
manner mentioned above, while the bubble in which he was contained unites with
the other, like two drops of water, when approached to each other. They ſpin
their webs as well in the water as upon land; and it is moſt probable that
they make their food of the ſmall inſects of either element.</p>
                  <p>The Tarantula is alſo of this ſpecies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
particular notice, not for any remarkable <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0824000107:271"/> properties
that really attend it, but for the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous falſehoods which have been
propagated concerning it. What may be ſaid with truth concerning it is, that
it is the largeſt of the ſpider kind known in Europe, and is a native of
Apulia in Italy. Its body is three quarters of an inch long, and about as thick
as one's little finger; the colour is generally an olive brown, variegated with
one that is more duſky; it has eight legs and eight eyes, like the reſt,
and nippers, which are ſharp and ſerrated: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe and the fore
legs, there are two little horns, or feelers, which it is obſerved to move
very briſkly when it approaches its prey. It is covered all over the body
with a ſoft down; and propagates, as other ſpiders, by laying eggs. In the
ſummer months, particularly in the dog days, the tarantula creeping among the
corn, bites the mowers and paſſengers; but in winter, it lurks in holes,
and is ſeldom ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Thus far is true; but now the fable begins: for though the
bite is attended with no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſymptoms, and will eaſily cure of
itſelf, wonderful ſtories are reported concerning its virulence. The part
which is bitten, as we are told, is ſoon after diſcoloured with a livid
black, or yellowiſh circle, attended with an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. At firſt the
pain is ſcarcely felt; but <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0824000107:272"/> a few hours after, come on
a violent ſickneſs, difficulty of breathing, fainting, and ſometimes
trembling. The perſon bit, after this does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but laugh, dance and
ſkip about, putting himſelf into the moſt extravagant poſtures; and
ſometimes alſo is ſeized with a moſt frightful melancholly. At the
return of the ſeaſon in which he was bit, his madneſs begins again; and
the patient always talks of the ſame things. Sometimes he fancies himſelf a
ſhepherd; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a king; appearing entirely out of his ſenſes.
Theſe troubleſome ſymptoms ſometimes return for ſeveral years
ſucceſſively, and at laſt terminate in death. But ſo dreadful a
diſorder has it ſeems not been left without a remedy; which is no other
than a well played fiddle. For this purpoſe the medical muſician plays a
particular tune, famous for the cure, which he begins ſlow, and encreaſes
in quickneſs as he ſees the patient affected. The patient no ſooner hears
the muſic, but he begins to dance; and continues ſo doing till he is all
over in a ſweat, which forces out the venom that appeared ſo dangerous.
This dancing ſometimes continues for three or four hours, before the patient
is weary, and before the ſweating is copious enough to cure the diſorder.
Such are the ſymptoms related of the tarantula poiſon; ſymptoms which 
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0824000107:273"/> ſome of the beſt and graveſt phyſicians have
credited, and attempted to account for. But the truth is, that the whole is an
impoſition of the peaſants upon travellers who happen to paſs through
that part of the country, and who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a trifle for ſuffering
themſelves to be bitten by the tarantula. Whenever they find a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
willing to try the experiment, they readily offer themſelves; and are ſure
to counterfeit the whole train of ſymptoms which muſic is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to
remove. A friend of mine, who paſſed through that part of the country, had
a truſty ſervant bitten, without ever adminiſtring the muſical cure:
the only ſymptoms were a ſlight inflammation, which was readily removed,
and no other conſequence ever attended the bite.—It is thus that
falſehoods prevail for a century or two; and mankind at laſt begin to
wonder how it was poſſible to keep up the deluſion ſo long.</p>

                  <p>THE hiſtory of thoſe animals with which we are the beſt
acquainted, are the firſt objects of our chiefeſt curioſity. There are
few but are well informed of the agility and the blood-thirſty
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Flea; of the caution with which it comes to the attack;
and the readineſs with which it avoids the purſuit. This inſect, which is
not only the enemy of mankind, but of the dog, cat, and ſeveral other
animals, is found in every part of the world, but bites with greater ſeverity
in ſome countries than in others. Its numbers in Italy and France are much
greater than in England; and yet its bite is much more troubleſome here, than
I have found it in any other place. It would ſeem that its force en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
with the coldneſs of the climate; and though leſs prolific, that it became
more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daceous.</p>
                  <p>If the flea be examined with a microſcope, it will be
obſerved to have a ſmall head, large eyes, and a roundiſh body. It has
two feelers, or horns, which are ſhort, and compoſed of four joints; and
between theſe lies its trunk, which <pb facs="tcp:0824000107:275"/>

through which it ſucks the blood in large quantities. The body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be
all over curiouſly adorned with a ſuit of poliſhed ſable armour, neatly
jointed, and beſet with multitudes of ſharp pins, almoſt like the quills
of a porcupine. It has ſix legs, the joints of which are ſo adapted, that
it can, as it were, fold them up one within another; and when it leaps, they
all ſpring out at once, whereby its whole ſtrength is exerted, and the body
raiſed above two hundred times its own diameter.</p>
                  <p>The young fleas are at firſt a ſort of nits or eggs, which
are round and ſmooth; and from theſe proceed white worms, of a ſhining
pearl colour: in a fortnight's time they come to a tolerable ſize, and are
very lively and active; but if they are touched at this time, they roll
themſelves up in a ball: ſoon after this they begin to creep, like
ſilk-worms that have no legs; and then they ſeek a place to lie hid in,
where they ſpin a ſilken thread from their mouth, and with this they
encloſe themſelves in a ſmall round bag or caſe, as white within as
writing paper, but dirty without: in this they continue for a fortnight longer;
after which they burſt from their confinement perfectly formed, and armed
with powers to diſturb the peace of an emperor.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Of the Louſe and its Varieties.</head>
                  <p>THE antipathies of mankind are various; ſome conſidering
the toad, ſome the ſerpent, ſome the ſpider, and ſome the beetle,
with a ſtrong degree of deteſtation: but while all wonder at the
ſtrangeneſs of each other's aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they all ſeem to unite in their
diſlike to the Louſe, and regard it as their natural and moſt nauſeous
enemy. Indeed, it ſeems the enemy of man in the moſt odious degree; for
wherever wretchedneſs, diſeaſe, or hunger ſeize upon him, the louſe
ſeldom fails to add itſelf to the tribe, and to encreaſe in proportion to
the number of his calamities.</p>
                  <p>In examining the human louſe with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope, its
external deformity firſt ſtrikes us with diſguſt: the ſhape of the
fore part of the head is ſomewhat oblong; that of the hind part ſomewhat
round: the ſkin is hard, and being ſtretched, tranſparent, with here and
there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral briſtly hairs: in the fore part is a proboſcis or
ſucker, which is ſeldom viſible: on each ſide of the head are antennae,
or horns, each divided into five joints, covered with briſtly hair; and 
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0824000107:278"/> ſeveral white veſſels are ſeen through theſe
horns: behind theſe are the eyes, which ſeem to want thoſe diviſions
obſervable in other inſects, and appear encompaſſed with ſome few
hairs: the neck is very ſhort, and the breaſt is divided into three parts;
on each ſide of which are placed ſix legs, conſiſting of ſix joints,
covered alſo with briſtly hairs: the ends of the legs are armed with two
ſmaller and larger ruddy claws, ſerving thoſe inſects as a finger and
thumb, by which they catch hold of ſuch objects as they approach: the end of
the body terminates in a cloven tail, while the ſides are all over hairy; the
whole reſembling clear parchment, and, when roughly preſſed, cracking
with a noiſe.</p>
                  <p>When we take a cloſer view, its white veins, and other
internal parts appear; as likewiſe a moſt wonderful motion in its
inteſtines, from the tranſparency of its external covering. When the
louſe feeds, the blood is ſeen to ruſh, like a torrent, into the
ſtomach; and its greedineſs is ſo great, that the excrements contained in
the inteſtines are ejected at the ſame time, to make room for this new
ſupply.</p>
                  <p>The louſe has neither beak, teeth, nor any kind of mouth, as
Doctor Hooke deſcribed it; for the entrance into the gullet is abſolutely
cloſed. In the place of all theſe, it has a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſcis 
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0824000107:279"/> or trunk; or, as it may be otherwiſe called, a pointed
hollow ſucker, with which it pierces the ſkin, and ſucks the human blood,
taking that for food only. The ſtomach is lodged partly in the breaſt and
back; but the greateſt portion of it is in the abdomen. When ſwolen with
blood, it appears of a dark brown colour, which is viſible through the
ſkin; and is either a faint red, or a full or bright brown, as the contents
of the ſtomach are more or leſs changed. When it is empty, it is
colourleſs; but when filled, it is plainly diſcernible, and its motion
ſeems very extraordinary. It then appears working with very ſtrong
agitations, and ſomewhat reſembles an animal within an animal. Superficial
obſervers are apt to take this for the pulſation of the heart; but if the
animal be obſerved when it is ſucking, it will then be found that the food
takes a direct paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the trunk to the ſtomach, where the
remainder of the old aliment will be ſeen mixing with the new, and agitated
up and down on every ſide.</p>
                  <p>If this animal be kept from food two or three days, and then
placed upon the back of the hand, or any ſoft part of the body, it will
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſeek for food; which it will the more readily find, if the hand
be rubbed till it grows <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0824000107:280"/> red. The animal then turns its
head, which lies between the two fore legs, to the ſkin, and diligently
ſearches for ſome pore: when found, it fixes the trunk therein; and ſoon
the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope diſcovers the blood aſcending through the head, in a very
rapid, and even frightful ſtream. The louſe has at that time ſufficient
appetite to feed in any poſture; it is then ſeen ſucking with its head
downward, and its tail elevated. If, during this operation, the ſkin be drawn
tight, the trunk is bound faſt, and the animal is incapable of diſengaging
itſelf; but it more frequently ſuffers from its gluttony, ſince it gorges
to ſuch a degree, that it is cruſhed to pieces by the ſlighteſt
impreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Whether lice are diſtinguiſhed by the parts of generation
into males and females, is not yet diſcovered: Swammerdam is enclined to
think that they are hermaphrodites, having found an ovary in all thoſe he
examined; and he diſſected not leſs than forty-two. In one of theſe
animals were found ten large eggs; and forty-four ſmaller, that were not yet
come to their full perfection.</p>
                  <p>There is ſcarce any animal that multiplies ſo faſt as
this unwelcome intruder. It has been pleaſantly ſaid, that a louſe
becomes a grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father in the ſpace of twenty-four hours: this 
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0824000107:281"/> fact cannot be aſcertained; but nothing is more true
than, that the moment the nit, which is no other than the egg of the louſe,
gets rid of its ſuperfluous moiſture, and throws off its ſhell, it then
begins to breed in its turn. Nothing ſo much prevents the encreaſe of this
nauſeous animal, as cold and want of humidity; the nits muſt be laid in a
place that is warm, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately moiſt, to produce any thing. This is the
reaſon that many nits laid on the hairs in the night-time, are deſtroyed by
the cold of the ſuceeding day; and ſo ſtick for ſeveral months, till
they at laſt come to loſe even their external form.</p>
                  <p>The louſe is found upon every part of the human body; but
particularly in the heads of children. Thoſe found upon the miners in Sweden,
are ſaid, by Linnaeus, to be very large; and he is of opinion, that the head
and the body-louſe differ in no reſpect from each other. The Pthiriaſis,
or louſy diſeaſe, though very little known at preſent, was frequent
enough among the ancients: Herod, Antiochus, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, Alcman the poet,
Pherecydes, Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander, Calliſthenes and Sylla, all died of this
diſorder. The uſe of mercury, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known among the ancients, may
probably have baniſhed it from among the moderns; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0824000107:282"/> it is, that thoſe animals ſeldom attack any in our
climate, but ſuch as from ſloth or famine invite their company.</p>
                  <p>Such is the hiſtory of the human louſe; which, from its
connection with mankind, deſerves firſt notice: but it would be endleſs
to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the various tribes that go under this name, and ſwarm upon
every part of nature. There is ſcarce an animal, and ſcarce even a
vegetable, that does not ſuffer under its own peculiar louſe. The ſheep,
the horſe, the hog, and the elephant, are all teized by them; the whale, the
ſhark, the ſalmon, and the lobſter, are not without their company; while
every hot-houſe, and every gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is infeſted with ſome peculiarly
deſtructive. Linnaeus tells us, that he once found a vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table-louſe upon
ſome plants newly arrived from America; and willing to trace the little
animal through its various ſtages, he brought it with him from London to
Leyden; where he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerved it during the winter, until it bred in
the ſpring: but the louſe it ſeems did not treat him with all the
gratitude he expected; for it became the parent of ſo numerous a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny,
that it ſoon overrun all the phyſic-garden of that beautiful city; and
leaves, to this day, many a gardener to curſe the Swede's too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
curioſity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0824000107:283"/>The animal which ſome have called the
Leaf Louſe, is of the ſize of a flea, and of a bright green, or bluiſh
green colour; the body is nearly oval, and is largeſt and moſt convex on
the hinder part; the breaſt is very ſmall, and the head is blunt and green:
the eyes may be ſeen very plainly, being prominent on the fore part of the
head, and of a ſhining black colour; near theſe there is a black line on
each ſide; and the legs are very ſlender.</p>
                  <p>Theſe animals are uſually found upon the leaves of the
orache, and other plants; and the weaker the leaves and buds are, theſe
inſects ſwarm upon them in greater abundance. Some plants are covered over
with them; though they are not the cauſe of the plants weakneſs, but the
ſign: however, by wounding and ſucking the leaf, they encreaſe the
diſeaſe. They ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally aſſume their colour from the plant on which
they reſide. Thoſe that feed upon pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbs and plum trees, are of an
aſh-colour; only they are greeniſh when they are young: thoſe that belong
to the alder and cherry-tree, are black; as alſo thoſe upon beans, and
ſome other plants: thoſe on the leaves of apples and roſe-trees, are
white: but as they leap, like graſsſhoppers, ſome place them in the
number of the flea kind. The moſt uncommon colour <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0824000107:284"/> is
reddiſh; and lice of this ſort may be found on the leaves of tanſey; and
their juice, when rubbed in the hands, tinges them with no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable red.
All theſe live upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective plant; and are often engendered
within the very ſubſtance of the leaf.</p>
                  <p>All theſe bring forth their young alive; and the faetus,
when it is ready to be brought forth, entirely fills the belly of the female;
its fore parts being excluded firſt, and then the hinder. The young one does
not begin to move till the horns or feelers appear out of the body of the old
one; and by the motion of theſe it firſt ſhews ſigns of life, moving
them in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and bending all their joints. When the horns and head
are excluded, the two fore feet follow, which they move with equal agility;
after this follow the middle feet, and then the hinder: ſtill, however, the
young one continues ſticking to its parent, ſupported only at one
extremity, and hanging as it were in air, until its ſmall and ſoft members
become hardened and fitted for ſelf-ſupport. The parent then gets rid of
its burthen; by moving from the place where ſhe was ſitting, and forcing
the young one to ſtand upon its legs, leaves it to ſhift for itſelf.</p>
                  <p>As the animal has not far to go, its proviſion 
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0824000107:285"/> lying beneath it, during the ſummer it continues to
eat and creep about with great agility. But as it is viviparous, and muſt
neceſſarily lurk ſomewhere in winter, where its body may be defended from
the cold, it endeavours to ſecure a retreat near the trees or plants that
ſerve to nouriſh it in the beginning of ſpring. They never hide
themſelves in the earth, like many other inſects, becauſe they have no
part of their bodies fitted to remove the earth; nor can they creep into every
chink, as their legs are too long: beſides, their bodies are ſo tender,
that the leaſt rough particle of the earth would hurt them. They therefore
get into the deep chinks of the bark, and into the cavities of the ſtronger
ſtalks, from whence they ſally out upon the branches and leaves, when the
warmth of the ſun begins to be felt. Neither the cold in the autumnal
ſeaſon, nor the leſſer degree of heat in the ſpring, ever hurts them;
they ſeldom, therefore, ſeek for hiding-places before the fall of the leaf,
and are alert enough to take the earlieſt advantage of the returning
ſpring.</p>
                  <p>Like many other inſects, they caſt their ſkins four
ſeveral times; and, what is very remarkable, the males have four wings, but
the females never have any. They all have long legs, not only to enable them to
creep over the long hairs of <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0824000107:286"/> plants and leaves, but
alſo to travel from one tree to another, when they happen to ſtand at a
diſtance. Their trunk or ſnout lies under their breaſt; and this they
thruſt into the pores of the plant to ſuck out the juice, for they do not
gnaw them, like the caterpillar; but ſo hurt them by ſucking, that the
leaves become ſpotted, and as it were overrun with ſcabs; for which
reaſon their edges always turn up towards the middle.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſaid, that theſe inſects are often carried
away and devoured by ants; but this Fryſch, from whom this deſcription is
taken, could never obſerve. The ants indeed are fond of thoſe trees where
there is a great number of thoſe inſects; but then it is only to ſuck the
juice which flows from the leaves that have been juſt wounded. This more
particularly happens in the heat of ſummer, when other moiſture is wanting:
however, he never found them hurting or carrying away any of theſe inſects
while alive; nor indeed were they able, for the leaf louſe is more than a
match for the ant at ſingle combat. Whenever they perceive the ant
approaching behind them, they kick back with their hinder feet, and thus drive
off the invader, as a horſe would a lion.</p>
                  <p>The three principal and conſtant enemies to

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Bug and its Varieties.</head>
                  <p>THE Bug is another of thoſe nauſeous inſects that
intrude upon the retreats of mankind; and that often baniſh that ſleep,
which even ſorrow and anxiety permitted to approach. This, to many men, is,
of all other inſects, the moſt troubleſome and obnoxious. The night is
uſually the ſeaſon when the wretched have reſt from their labour; but
this ſeems the only ſeaſon when the bug iſſues from its retreats, to
make its depredations. By day it lurks, like a robber, in the moſt ſecret
parts of the bed; takes the advantage of every chink and cranny, to make a
ſecure lodgment; and contrives its habitation with ſo much art, that
ſcarce any induſtry can diſcover its retreat. It ſeems to avoid the
light with great cunning; and even if candles be kept burning, this formidable
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect will not iſſue from its hiding-place. But when darkneſs
promiſes ſecurity, it then iſſues from every corner of the bed, drops
from the teſter, crawls from behind the arras, and travels with great
aſſiduity to the unhappy patient, who vainly wiſhes for reſt and
refreſhment. It is <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0824000107:289"/> generally vain to deſtroy one
only, as there are hundreds more to revenge their companion's fate; ſo that
the perſon who thus is ſubject to be bitten, remains the whole night like a
cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel upon duty, rather watching the approach of freſh invaders, than
inviting the pleaſing approaches of ſleep.</p>
                  <p>Nor are theſe inſects leſs diſagreeable from their
nauſeous ſtench, than their unceaſing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. When they begin to
crawl, the whole bed is infected with the ſmell; but if they are accidentally
killed, then it is inſupportable.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are a part of the inconveniences that reſult from
the perſecution of theſe odious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects: but happily for Great Britain,
they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply leſs in theſe iſlands, than in any part of the continent.
In France and Italy the beds, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in their inns, ſwarm with them;
and every piece of furniture ſeems to afford them a retreat. They grow larger
alſo with them than with us, and bite with more cruel appetite.</p>
                  <p>This animal, if examined minutely, appears to conſiſt of
three principal parts; the head, the corſelet, and the belly. It has two
brown eyes, that are very ſmall, and a little prominent, beſides two
feelers, with three joints: underneath theſe there is a crooked trunk, which
is its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of torture, and which, when in motion, 
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0824000107:290"/> lies cloſe upon the breaſt. The breaſt is a kind
of ring, in which are placed the two firſt pair of legs. The belly
conſiſts of nine rings; under which are placed two pair of legs more,
making ſix in all. Each leg has three joints, which form the thigh, the leg,
and the foot, which is armed with a crooked claw, like an hook. The body is
ſmooth, except a few ſhort hairs, that may be ſeen by the microſcope,
about the vent, and on the two laſt rings. Its motion is ſlow and unwieldy;
yet its ſight is ſo exquiſite, that the inſtant it perceives the light,
it generally makes good its retreat; and they are ſeldom caught, though the
bed ſwarms with them.</p>
                  <p>If we examine this inſect internally, we ſhall find the
great artery, which in all inſects per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the functions of the heart; we
ſhall find the apertures of the lungs on the right ſide and the left,
through which the animal breathes; we ſhall find a ſtomach and
inteſtines, which, as in other animals, run from the mouth to the anus. If
the inſect has been kept long faſting, there will be a mucous found in its
body, like the white of an egg; but if cruſhed after a full meal, the human
blood, which it has ſucked in, will appear a little darkened by having
paſſed through the inſect's body.</p>
                  <p>The male and female of theſe animals are 
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0824000107:291"/> plainly diſtinguiſhable from each other; and the
parts of generation are obvious enough. They are often found coupling tail to
tail; and in this ſtate are very eaſily deſtroyed. The female has an
ovary filled with eggs, joined together like a bunch of grapes; each egg being
oblong, almoſt cylindrical, inclining to white, and pretty tranſparent. In
about two days after impregnation by the male, ſhe depoſits her eggs to the
number of about an hundred and fifty, in ſome convenient place where they are
likely to receive no diſturbance. There they continue for ſome months;
during which time, neither cold nor heat, neither moiſture nor fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation,
can in the leaſt retard their excluſion; but they come forth active, and
ready for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. It is this hardineſs in the ſhell that ſeems to
continue the breed; as the old ones die every winter, or are eaſily
deſtroyed by any fumigation that is uſed for that purpoſe. But the eggs
ſeem incapable of deſtruction; even thoſe men who make a livelihood by
killing theſe nauſeous inſects, though they can anſwer for the parent,
can never be ſure of the egg. For this reaſon they uſually pay thoſe
houſes to which they are called a ſecond or a third viſit, and at laſt
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate them by perſeverance.</p>
                  <p>The manner of deſtroying them ſeems rather 
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0824000107:292"/> the effects of aſſiduity than antidote; for the men
called in upon this occaſion, take every part of the furniture aſunder,
bruſh every part of it with great aſſiduity, anoint it with a liquid,
which I take to be a ſolution of corroſive ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate, and having
performed this operation twice or thrice, the vermin are moſt uſually
deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Cleanlineſs, therefore, ſeems to be the beſt antidote to
remove theſe nauſeous inſects; and wherever that is wanting, their
encreaſe ſeems but a juſt puniſhment. Indeed, they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
found in ſuch numbers among old fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and neglected chambers, expoſed
to the ſouth, that, wanting other ſuſtenance, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour each other.
They are alſo enemies to other vermin, and deſtroy fleas very effectually;
ſo that we ſeldom have the double perſecution of different vermin in the
ſame bed. Of the bug kind Linnaeus reckons up forty.</p>

                  <p>THE common Wood Louſe is ſeldom above half an inch long,
and a quarter of an inch broad. The colour is of a livid black, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when found about dung-hills, and on the ground; but thoſe that are to be met
with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tiles, and in drier places, are of the colour of the hair of an
aſs. It has fourteen feet, ſeven on each ſide; and they have only one
joint each, which is ſcarcely perceivable. It has two ſhort feelers, and
the body is of an oval ſhape. When it is touched, it rolls itſelf up into a
ſort of a ball; and the ſides, near the feet, are dentated, like a ſaw.
It is often found among rotten timber, and on decayed trees: in winter it lies
hid in the crevices of walls and all ſorts of buildings. The male is eaſily
diſtinguiſhable from the female, being leſs, and more ſlender. The eggs
they lay are white and ſhining, like ſeed pearls, and are very numerous:
however, more properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although, when excluded, the young have all
the appearance of an egg, yet they are alive, and, without throwing off any
ſhell, ſtir and <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0824000107:294"/> move about with great vivacity; ſo
that this animal may properly be ſaid to be viviparous. The little worms at
firſt ſeem ſcarce able to ſtir; but they ſoon feed, and become very
briſk. Theſe animals are of great uſe in medicine: being impregnated with
a ſaline quality, which is diuretic and ſtimulating. Of this inſect
Linnaeus makes three ſpecies.</p>

Water-Flea.</head>
                  <p>THIS animal, which is of the ſize of a flea, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the
ſight, unaſſiſted by the microſcope, to have but one eye; for the
eyes, by reaſon of the ſmallneſs of the head, ſeem to be joined to each
other: they are ſituated in the trunk of this inſect, and the beak is
likewiſe very ſmall and ſharp pointed. The ſtructure of the eye is
ſeen, by the microſcope, to be reticulated, or made like a net; and the
trunk of this inſect, by which it feeds, is not only ſmall and ſharp, but
alſo tranſparent. The inſects are of a blood red colour; and ſometimes
are ſeen in ſuch multitudes on the ſurface of ſtanding water, as to
make them appear all over red, whence many fanciful people have thought the
water to be turned into blood.</p>
                  <p>Swammerdam tells us of a celebrated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Leyden,
who was at firſt aſtoniſhed by an appearance of this kind. Being once
intent upon his ſtudies, he heard a noiſe, of which, as it encreaſed by
degrees, he was deſirous to know the cauſe. The maid-ſervant attending to
his ſummons, appeared quite petrified with <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0824000107:298"/> fear, and
told him, with a tremulous voice, that all the waters of Leyden were turned
into blood. Upon this he went directly in a ſmall bark to the place where the
water was thus changed, and put ſome of the bloody water into a glaſs; but
upon viewing it with attention, he obſerved, that it abounded with infinite
num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of theſe little red inſects, which tinged the whole body of the
fluid with that ſeemingly formidable colour. Thus his ſudden fright was
changed into laſting admiration.</p>
                  <p>Of all parts of this animal, its branching arms, and the
motion it makes with them in the water, deſerve our greateſt attention. By
theſe the little creature can move in a ſtraight line; waving its arms, as
a bird does its wings in the air, ſometimes upward, ſometimes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
ſometimes to the right, ſometimes to the left, yet ſtill continuing to
proceed in a right line. By ſtriking the water with its arms, it can aſcend
with great velocity; and by ſtriking in a contrary direction, it dives with
equal eaſe. As theſe motions are very rapid, the little ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal appears to
jump in the water, its head always tending to the ſurface, and its tail
ſtretched downward. This inſect is produced from an egg, which, when
excluded, is carried on the back of the female, and ſoon is ſeen 
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0824000107:299"/> floating in the water round her. Its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at
firſt is that of a very ſmall whitiſh inſect, endued with a very nimble
motion. Except in colour, it ſuffers no change, only continuing to grow
larger and redder, as it grows old. They ſometimes remain ſeveral days on
the ſurface of the water; and ſometimes are ſeen at the bottom only; but
they are never at reſt. They change their ſkin, like moſt other
inſects; and the caſt ſkin reſembles the inſect itſelf ſo
exactly, that one might miſtake the maſk for the animal.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Scorpion and its Varieties.</head>
                  <p>THERE is ſcarce an inſect without wings that is not
obnoxious to man: the ſmalleſt have the power of annoying him, either by
biting or ſtinging him; and though each is in itſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, they
become formidable from their numbers. But of all this claſs, there is none
ſo terrible as the Scorpion, whoſe ſhape is hideous, whoſe ſize among
the inſect tribe is enormous, and whoſe ſting is generally fatal. Happy
for England, the ſcorpion is entirely a ſtranger among us! In ſeveral
parts of the continent of Europe it is but too well known, though it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
grows above four inches long: but in the warm tropical climates, it is ſeen a
foot in length, and in every reſpect as large as a lobſter.</p>
                  <p>The ſcorpion is one of the largeſt of the inſect tribe,
and not leſs terrible from its ſize than its malignity. It reſembles a
lobſter ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in ſhape, but is infinitely more hideous. There have
been enumerated nine different kinds of this dangerous inſect, chiefly
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their colour: there being ſcorpions 
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0824000107:301"/> yellow, brown, and aſh coloured; others that are the
colour of ruſty iron, green, pale yellow, black, claret colour, white, and
grey.</p>
                  <p>There are four principal parts diſtinguiſhable in this
animal; the head, the breaſt, the belly, and the tail. The ſcorpion's head
ſeems, as it were, jointed to the breaſt, in the middle of which are ſeen
two eyes; and a little more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, two eyes more, placed in the fore part of
the head: theſe eyes are ſo ſmall, that they are ſcarcely perceivable;
and it is probable the animal has but little occaſion for ſeeing. The mouth
is furniſhed with two jaws; the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is divided into two, and the
parts notched into each other, which ſerves the animal as teeth, and with
which it breaks its food, and thruſts it into its mouth: theſe the
ſcorpion can at pleaſure pull back into its mouth, ſo that no part of
them can be ſeen. On each ſide of the head are two arms, each compoſed of
four joints; the laſt of which is large, with ſtrong muſcles, and made in
the manner of a lobſter's claw. Below the breaſt are eight articulated
legs, each divided into ſix joints; the two hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of which are each
provided with two crooked claws, and here and there covered with hair. The
belly is divided into ſeven little rings; from the loweſt of which is
continued a <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0824000107:302"/> tail, compoſed of ſix joints, which are
briſtly, and formed like little globes, the laſt being armed with a crooked
ſting. This is that fatal inſtrument which renders this inſect ſo
formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: it is long, pointed, hard and hollow; it is pierced near the
baſe by two ſmall holes, through which, when the animal ſtings, it ejects
a drop of poiſon, which is white, cauſtic, and fatal. The reſervoir in
which this poiſon is kept, is in a ſmall bladder near the tail, into which
the venom is diſtilled by a peculiar apparatus. If this bladder be gently
preſſed, the venom will be ſeen iſſuing out through the two holes
above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; ſo that it appears, that when the animal ſtings, the
bladder is preſſed, and the venom iſſues through the two apertures into
the wound.</p>
                  <p>There are few animals more formidable, or more truly
miſchievous than the ſcorpion. As it takes refuge in a ſmall place, and
is generally found ſheltering in houſes, ſo it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than that it muſt frequently ſting thoſe among whom it reſides. In
ſome of the towns of Italy, and in France, in the province of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc, it
is one of the greateſt peſts that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mankind: but its malignity in
Europe is trifling, when compared to what the natives of Africa, and the
eaſt, are known to experience. <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0824000107:303"/> In Batavia, where they
grow twelve inches long, there is no removing any piece of furniture, without
the utmoſt danger of being ſtung by them. Boſman aſſures us, that,
along the Gold Coaſt, they are often found larger than a lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and that
their ſting is inevitably fatal. In Europe, however, they are by no means
ſo large, ſo venomous, or ſo plenty. The general ſize of this animal
does not exceed two or three inches; and its ſting is very ſeldom found to
be fatal. Maupertius, who made ſeveral experiments on the ſcorpion of
Languedoc, found it by no means ſo invariably dangerous as had till then been
repreſented. He provoked one of them to ſting a dog, in three places of the
belly, where the animal was without hair. In about an hour after the poor
animal ſeemed greatly ſwolen, and became very ſick: he then caſt up
whatever he had in his bowels; and, for about three hours, continued vomiting a
whitiſh liquid. The belly was always greatly ſwolen, when the animal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to vomit; but this operation always ſeemed to abate the ſwelling; which
alternately ſwelled, and was thus emptied, for three hours
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively. The poor animal, after this, fell into convulſions, bit
the ground, dragged himſelf along upon his fore feet, and at laſt died,
five hours after being bitten. He was not partially <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0824000107:304"/>
ſwolen round the place which was bitten, as is uſual after the ſting of a
waſp or a bee; but his whole body was inflated, and there only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a
red ſpot on the places where he had been ſtung.</p>
                  <p>Some days after, however, the ſame expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment was tried
upon another dog, and even with more aggravated cruelty; yet the dog ſeemed
no way affected by the wounds, but howling a little when he received them,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued alert and well after them; and ſoon after was ſet at liberty,
without ſhewing the ſmalleſt ſymptoms of pain. So far was this poor
creature from being terrified at the experiment, that he left his own
maſter's houſe, to come to that of the philoſopher, where he had received
more plentiful entertainment. The ſame experiment was tried by freſh
ſcorpions, upon ſeven other dogs, and upon three hens; but not the
ſmalleſt deadly ſymptom was ſeen to enſue. From hence it appears,
that many circumſtances, which are utterly unknown, muſt contribute to give
efficacy to the ſcorpion's venom. Whether its food, long faſting, the
ſeaſon, the nature of the veſſels it wounds, or its ſtate of
maturity, contribute to, or retard its malignity, is yet to be aſcertained by
ſucceeding experiment. In the trials made by our philoſopher, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed 
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0824000107:305"/> ſcorpions of both ſexes, newly caught, and
ſeemingly vigorous and active. The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this experiment may
ſerve to ſhew that, many of thoſe boaſted antidotes which are given for
the cure of the ſcorpion's ſting, owe their ſucceſs rather to accident
than their own efficacy. They only happened to cure, when their ſting was no
way dangerous; but in caſes of actual malignity, they might probably be
utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable.</p>
                  <p>The ſcorpion of the tropical climates being much larger than
the former, is probably much more venomous. Helbigius, however, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
for many years in the eaſt, aſſures us, that he was often ſtung by the
ſcorpion, and never received any material injury from the wound: a painful
tumour generally enſued; but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cured it, by rubbing the part with a
piece of iron or ſtone, as he had ſeen the Indians practiſe before him,
until the fleſh became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible. Seba, Moore and Boſman, however,
give a very different account of the ſcorpion's malignity; and aſſert
that, unleſs ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the wound becomes fatal.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that, no animal in the creation ſeems endued
with ſuch an iraſcible nature. I have often ſeen them taken and put into
a place of ſecurity, exerting all their rage againſt the 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0824000107:306"/> ſides of the glaſs veſſel that contained them. I
have ſeen them attempt to ſting a ſtick, when put near them; and attack a
mouſe or a frog, while thoſe animals were far from offering any injury.
Maupertius put three ſcorpions and a mouſe into the ſame veſſel
together, and they ſoon ſtung the little animal in different places. The
mouſe, thus aſſaulted, ſtood for ſome time upon the defenſive, and
at laſt killed them all, one after another. He tried this experiment, in
order to ſee whether the mouſe, after it had killed, would eat the
ſcorpions; but the little qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupede ſeemed entirely ſatisfied with the
victory, and even ſurvived the ſeverity of the wounds it had received.
Wolkamer tried the courage of the ſcorpion againſt the large ſpider, and
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed ſeveral of both kinds in glaſs veſſels, for that
purpoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Ephemerides. Dec. II. 1687. Obſerv.
224.</bibl>
                     </note>. The ſucceſs of this combat was very remarkable. The
ſpider at firſt uſed all its efforts to immeſh the ſcorpion in its
web, which it immediately began ſpinning; but the ſcorpion reſcued
itſelf from the danger, by ſtinging its adverſary to death: it ſoon
after cut off, with its claws, all the legs of the ſpider, and then ſucked
all the internal parts at its leiſure.—If the ſcorpion's ſkin had
not been ſo hard, Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kamer is of opinion that the ſpider would have 
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0824000107:307"/> obtained the victory; for he had often ſeen one of
theſe ſpiders deſtroy a toad.</p>
                  <p>The fierce ſpirit of this animal is equally dangerous to its
own ſpecies; for ſcorpions are the cruelleſt enemies to each other.
Maupertius put about an hundred of them together in the ſame glaſs; and
they ſcarce came into contact, when they began to exert all their rage in
mutual deſtruction: there was nothing to be ſeen but one univerſal
carnage, without any diſtinction of age or ſex; ſo that, in a few days,
there remained only fourteen, which had killed and devoured all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>But their unnatural malignity is ſtill more apparent, in
their cruelty to their offspring. He encloſed a female ſcorpion, big with
young, in a glaſs veſſel, and ſhe was ſeen to devour them as faſt
as they were excluded: there was but one only of the number that eſcaped the
general deſtruction, by taking refuge on the back of its parent; and this
ſoon after revenged the cauſe of its brethren, by killing the old one in
its turn.</p>
                  <p>Such is the terrible and unrelenting nature of this inſect,
which neither the bonds of ſociety, nor of nature can reclaim: it is even
aſſerted that, when driven to an extremity, the ſcorpion will often
deſtroy itſelf. The following expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0824000107:308"/> was
ineffectually tried by Maupertius: but I am ſo well aſſured of it by many
eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes, who have ſeen it both in Italy and America, that I have no
doubt remaining of its veracity. A ſcorpion, newly caught, is placed in the
midſt of a circle of burning charcoal, and thus an egreſs prevented on
every ſide: the ſcorpion, as I am aſſured, runs for about a minute
round the circle, in hopes of eſcaping; but finding that impoſſible, it
ſtings itſelf on the back of the head, and in this manner the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
ſuicide inſtantly expires.</p>
                  <p>It is happy for mankind that theſe animals are thus
deſtructive to each other; ſince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would multiply in ſo
great a degree as to render ſome countries uninhabitable. The male and female
of this inſect are very eaſily diſtinguiſhable; the male being
ſmaller and leſs hairy. The female brings forth her young alive, and
perfect in their kind. Redi having bought a quantity of ſcorpions,
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the females, which by their ſize and roughneſs were eaſily
diſtinguiſhable from the reſt, and putting them in ſeparate glaſs
veſſels, he kept them for ſome days without food. In about five days one
of them brought forth thirty-eight young ones, well ſhaped, and of a
milk-white colour, which changed every day more and <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0824000107:309"/> more
into a dark ruſty hue. Another female, in a different veſſel, brought
forth twenty-ſeven of the ſame colour; and the day following the young ones
ſeemed all fixed to the back and belly of the female. For near a fortnight
all theſe continued alive and well; but afterwards ſome of them died daily:
until, in about a month, they all died, except two.</p>
                  <p>Were it worth the trouble, theſe animals might be kept
living as long as curioſity ſhould think proper. Their chief food is worms
and inſects; and upon a proper ſupply of theſe, their lives might be
lengthened to their natural extent. How long that may be we are not told; but
if we may argue from analogy, it cannot be leſs than ſeven or eight years;
and perhaps, in the larger kind, double that duration. As they have ſomewhat
the form of the lobſter, ſo they reſemble that animal in caſting their
ſhell, or more properly their ſkin; ſince it is ſofter by far than the
covering of the lobſter, and ſet with hairs, which grow from it in great
abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, particularly at the joinings. The young lie in the womb of the
parent, each covered up in its own membrane, to the number of forty or fifty,
and united to each other by an oblong thread, ſo as to exhibit altogether the
form of a chaplet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0824000107:310"/>Such is the manner in which the common
ſcorpion produces its young: but there is a ſcorpion of America, produced
from the egg, in the manner of the ſpider. The eggs are no larger than pins
points; and they are depoſited in a web, which they ſpin from their bodies,
and carry about with them, till they are hatched. As ſoon as the young ones
are excluded from the ſhell, they get upon the back of the parent, who turns
her tail over them, and defends them with her ſting. It ſeems probable,
therefore, that captivity produces that unnatural diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the
ſcorpion, which induces it to deſtroy its young; ſince, at liberty, it is
found to protect them with ſuch unceaſing aſſiduity.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. Of the Scolopendra and Gally-worm.</head>
                  <p>OF theſe hideous and angry inſects we know little, except
the figure and the noxious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. Though with us there are inſects
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembling them in form, we are placed at an happy diſtance
from ſuch as are really for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable. With us they ſeldom grow above an inch
long; in the tropical climates they are often found above a quarter of a
yard.</p>
                  <p>The Scolopendra is otherwiſe called the Centipes, from the
number of its feet; and it is very common in many parts of the world,
eſpecially between the tropics. Thoſe of the Eaſt-Indies, where they grow
to the largeſt ſize, are about ſix inches long, of a ruddy colour, and as
thick as a man's finger: they conſiſt of many joints; and from each joint
is a leg on each ſide: they are covered with hair, and ſeem to have no
eyes; but there are two feelers on the head, which they make uſe of to find
out the way they are to paſs: the head is very round, with two ſmall
ſharp teeth, with which they inflict wounds that are very painful and
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. A ſailor that was bit by one on board <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0824000107:312"/> a
ſhip, felt an exceſſive pain, and his life was ſuppoſed to be in
danger: however, he recovered, by the application of three roaſted onions to
the part; and was ſoon quite well. Of this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal there are different kinds;
ſome living, like worms, in holes in the earth; others under ſtones, and
among rotten wood: ſo that nothing is more dangerous than removing thoſe
ſubſtances, in the places where they breed.</p>
                  <p>The Gally-worm differs from the ſcolopendra, in having
double the number of feet; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two on each ſide, to every joint of
the body. Some of theſe are ſmooth, and others hairy; ſome are yellow,
ſome black, and ſome brown. They are found among decayed trees, between the
wood and the bark; as alſo among ſtones that are covered with moſs. They
all, when touched, contract themſelves, rolling themſelves up like a ball.
Whatever may be their qualities in the tropical parts of the world, in Europe
they are perfectly harmleſs; having been often handled and irritated, without
any vindictive conſequences.</p>
                  <p>All theſe, as well as the ſcorpion, are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to
be produced perfect from the parent, or the egg; and to undergo no changes,
after their firſt excluſion. They are ſeen of all ſizes; 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0824000107:313"/> and this is a ſufficient inducement to ſuppoſe,
that they preſerve their firſt appearance, through the whole of their
exiſtence. It is probable, however, that, like moſt of this claſs, they
often change their ſkins; but of this we have no certain information.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. Of the Leech.</head>
                  <p>THE laſt of this wingleſs tribe that I ſhall mention is
the Leech, which, like all the former, undergoes no varieties of
transformation; but when once excluded from the body of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
preſerves its firſt figure to the end. I place the hiſtory of the leech
among the firſt claſs of inſects; while I have degraded the Earth-worm,
the Taenia, and the Polypus, into the claſs of zoophytes, or that imperfect
tribe which ſerves to make the ſhade between animal and vegetable nature.
Not but that the earth-worm or the polypus have their motions, their appetites,
and their vital principles, as compleat as the leech, and to a curſory view
appear every way as compleat animals. But there is one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that
lays the line between them; that exalts the one and degrades the other. The
earth-worm and the polypus may be cut into pieces, and each piece will produce
a new and perfect animal: the leech cannot ſuffer this diſſection, but
dies when cut in two; an evident inſtance that it is poſſeſſed of a
more perfect <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0824000107:315"/> organization than thoſe animals which it
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very much reſembles.</p>
                  <p>The leech, from its uſes in medicine, is one of thoſe
inſects that man has taken care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide; but of a great variety, one kind
only is conſidered as ſerviceable. The horſe-leech, which is the
largeſt of all, and grows to four inches in length, with a gloſſy black
ſurface, is of no uſe, as it will not ſtick to the ſkin; the
ſnail-leech is but an inch in length; and though it will ſtick, is not
large enough to extract a ſufficient quantity of blood from the patient; the
broad tailed leech, which grows to an inch and an half in length, with the back
raiſed into a ſort of a ridge, will ſtick but on very few occaſions: it
is the large brown leech, with a whitiſh belly, that is made uſe of in
medicine, and whoſe hiſtory beſt merits our curioſity.</p>
                  <p>The leech has the general figure of a worm, and is about as
long as one's middle finger. Its ſkin is compoſed of rings, by means of
which it is poſſeſſed of its agility, and ſwims in water. It
contracts itſelf, when out of water, in ſuch a manner, that when touched it
is not above an inch long. It has a ſmall head, and a black ſkin, edged
with a yellow line on each ſide, with ſome yellowiſh ſpots on the back.
The belly alſo, which is <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0824000107:316"/> of a reddiſh colour, is
marked with whitiſh yellow ſpots. But the moſt remarkable part of this
animal is the mouth, which is compoſed of two lips, that take whatever form
the inſect finds convenient. When at reſt, the opening is uſually
triangular; and within it are placed three very ſharp teeth, capable of
piercing not only the human ſkin, but alſo that of an horſe or an ox.
Still deeper in the head, is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the tongue, which is compoſed of a
ſtrong fleſhy ſubſtance, and which ſerves to aſſiſt the animal
in ſucking, when it has inflicted its triple wound; for no ſooner is this
voracious creature applied to the ſkin, than it buries its teeth therein,
then cloſes its lips round the wounds which it has made; and thus, in the
manner of a cupping-glaſs, extracts the blood as it flows to the different
orifices.</p>
                  <p>In examining this animal's form farther to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the tail, it
is ſeen to have a gullet and an inteſtinal canal, into which the blood
flows in great abundance. On each ſide of this are ſeen running along
ſeveral little bladders, which, when the animal is empty, ſeem to be filled
with nothing but water; but when it is gorging blood, they ſeem to
communicate with the inteſtines, and receive a large portion of the blood
which flows into the body. If theſe bladders ſhould be 
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0824000107:317"/> conſidered as ſo many ſtomachs, then every leech
will be found to have twenty-four. But what is moſt extraordinary of all in
this animal's formation is, that though it takes ſo large a quantity of food,
it has no anus or paſſage to eject it from the body when it has been
digeſted. On the contrary, the blood which the leech has thus ſucked
remains for ſeveral months clotted within its body, blackened a little by the
change, but no way putrefied, and very little altered in its texture or
conſiſtence. In what manner it paſſes through the animal's body, or how
it contributes to its nouriſhment, is not eaſily accounted for. The water
in which they are kept is very little diſcoloured by their continuance; they
cannot be ſuppoſed to return the blood by the ſame paſſage through
which it was taken in; it only remains, therefore, that it goes off through the
pores of the body, and that theſe are ſufficiently large to permit its
excluſion.</p>
                  <p>But it is not in this inſtance alone that the leech differs
from all other inſects. It was remarked in a former chapter, that the whole
inſect tribe had the opening into their lungs placed in their ſides, and
that they breathed through thoſe apertures as other animals through the
mouth. A drop of oil poured on the ſides <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0824000107:318"/> of a waſp,
a bee, or a worm, would quickly ſuffocate them, by ſtopping up the
paſſages through which they breathe; but it is otherwiſe with the leech,
for this animal may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in oil without injury; nay, it will live
therein; and the only damage it will ſuſtain is, that when taken out it
will be ſeen to caſt a fine pelucid ſkin exactly of the ſhape of the
animal, after which it is as alert and vigorous as before. It appears from
hence that the leech breathes through the mouth; and, in fact, it has a motion
that ſeems to reſemble the act of reſpiration in more perfect animals:
but concerning all this we are very much in the dark.</p>
                  <p>This animal ſeems to differ from all others in ſeveral
reſpects; the reſt of the reptile tribe are brought forth from eggs; the
leech is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viparous, and produces its young one after the other, to the number
of forty or fifty at a birth. It is probable that, like the ſnail, each
inſect contains the two ſexes, and that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregnates and is impregnated
in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The young ones are chiefly found in the month of July,
in ſhallow running waters, and particularly where they are tepified by the
rays of the ſun. The large ones are chiefly ſought after; and being put
into a glaſs veſſel <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0824000107:319"/> filled with water, they remain
for months, nay for years, without taking any other ſubſiſtence. But they
never breed in this confinement; and, conſequently, what regards that part of
their hiſtory ſtill remains obſcure.</p>
                  <p>In this part of the world they ſeldom grow to above four
inches; but in America and the Eaſt they are found from ſix to ſeven.
Their pools there abound with them in ſuch numbers, that it would be
dangerous bathing there, if for no other conſideration. Our ſailors and
ſoldiers, who the laſt war were obliged to walk in thoſe countries
through marſhy grounds, talk with terror of the number of leeches that
infeſted them on their march. Even in ſome parts of Europe they encreaſe
ſo as to become formidable. Sedelius, a German phyſician, relates, that a
girl of nine years old, who was keeping ſheep near the city of Bomſt in
Poland, perceiving a ſoldier making up to her, went to hide herſelf in a
neighbouring marſh among ſome buſhes; but the number of leeches was ſo
great in this place, and they ſtuck to her ſo cloſe, that the poor
creature expired from the quantity of blood which ſhe loſt by their united
efforts. Nor is this much to be wondered at, ſince one of thoſe inſects
that when empty ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally weighs but a ſcruple, will, when gorged, weigh
more than two drachms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0824000107:320"/>When leeches are to be applied, the
beſt way is to take them from the water in which they are contained about an
hour before, for they thus become more voracious and faſten more readily.
When ſaturated with blood, they generally fall off of themſelves; but if it
be thought neceſſary to take them from the wound, care ſhould be uſed
to pull them very gently, or even to ſprinkle them with ſalt if they
continue to adhere; for if they be plucked rudely away, it moſt frequently
happens that they leave their teeth in the wound, which makes a very
troubleſome inflammation, and is often attended with danger. If they be
ſlow in fixing to the part, they are often enticed by rubbing it with milk or
blood, or water mixed with ſugar. As ſalt is a poiſon to moſt
inſects, many people throw it upon the leech when it has dropped from the
wound, by which means it diſgorges the blood it has ſwallowed, and it is
then kept for repeated application. They ſeldom, however, ſtick after this
operation; and as the price is but ſmall, freſh leeches ſhould always be
applied whenever ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is thought neceſſary.</p>

                  <p>IN the former part we gave a conciſe hiſtory of the moſt
conſiderable inſects that, without wings, were produced in a perfect
ſtate; either from the body of the parent alive, like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes, or from
the egg, in the manner of birds. We come now to a ſecond order of inſects,
that are produced from the egg, like the former, but not in a perfect ſtate;
for when firſt excluded, they are without wings. This, however, does not
hinder the exerciſe of their animal functions; the inſect, although not yet
come to perfection, walks, leaps, and eats; nor is it ever deprived of motion,
only that it reſts a little when it is about to caſt that part of its
ſkin previous to its ſtate of perfection. It is then ſeen to aſſume
two wings, which, like a budding flower, burſt through the caſe that
contained them, and the animal becomes a winged inſect in its ſtate of
higheſt perfection. To this order we may refer the Libella, or Dragon-Fly;
the Formica Leo, or Lion-Ant; the Graſhopper; the Locuſt; the Cricket; the
Wood-Cricket; the Mole-Cricket; the Flea-Locuſt; the Flying-Bug; the Tipula;
the Water-Scorpion; the Notonecta, or Water-Fly, and many others.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of the Libella or Dragon-Fly.</head>
                  <p>OF all the flies which adorn or diverſify the face of
Nature, theſe are the moſt various and the moſt beautiful; they are of
all colours; green, blue, crimſon, ſcarlet, white; ſome unite a variety
of the moſt vivid tints, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit in one animal more different ſhades
than are to be found in the rainbow. They are called, in different parts of the
kingdom, by different names; but none can be at a loſs to know them, as they
are diſtinguiſhed from all other flies by the length of their bodies, by
the largeneſs of their eyes, and the beautiful tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency of their
wings, which are four in number. They are ſeen in ſummer flying with great
rapidity near every hedge, and by every running brook; they ſometimes
ſettle on the leaves of plants, and ſometimes keep for hours together on
the wing.</p>
                  <p>Dragon-flies, though there are three or four different kinds,
yet agree in the moſt ſtriking parts of their hiſtory, and one account
may ſerve for all. The largeſt ſort are generally found from two to three
inches long; their tail <pb n="317" facs="tcp:0824000107:324"/> is forked; their body divided
into eleven rings; their eyes are large, horny, and tranſparent, divided by a
number of interſections; and their wings, that always lie flat when they are
at reſt, are of a beautiful gloſſy tranſparency; ſometimes ſhining
like ſilver, and ſometimes gliſtening like gold. Within the mouth are to
be ſeen two teeth covered with a beautiful lip: with theſe the creatures
bite fiercely when they are taken; but their bite is perfectly harmleſs, as I
have experienced more than once.</p>
                  <p>Theſe inſects, beautiful as they are, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from
eggs, which are depoſited in the water, where they remain for ſome time
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeming life or motion. They are ejected by the female into the
water in cluſters, like a bunch of grapes, where they ſink to the bottom by
their natural weight, and continue in that ſtate till the young ones find
ſtrength enough to break the ſhell, and to ſeparate from each other. The
form in which they firſt ſhew life is that of a worm with ſix legs,
bearing a ſtrong reſemblance to the dragon-fly in its winged ſtate,
except that the wings are yet concealed within a ſheath peculiar to this
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. The rudiments of theſe appear in bunches on the back, within which
the wings are folded up into each other, while all the colours and 
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0824000107:325"/> varieties of painting appear tranſparent through the
ſkin. Theſe animals, upon quitting the egg, ſtill continue in the water,
where they creep and ſwim, but do not move ſwiftly. They have likewiſe a
ſharp ſight, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſink to the bottom, if any one comes to the
places wherein they live, or when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they perceive the leaſt uncommon
object. Their food at that time is ſoft mud and the glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous earthy
ſubſtances that are found at the bottom.</p>
                  <p>When theſe animals prepare to change from their reptile to
their flying ſtate, they then move out of the water to a dry place; as into
graſs; to pieces of wood, ſtone, or any thing elſe they meet with. They
there firmly fix their acute claws; and, for a ſhort time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue quite
immoveable, as if meditating on the change they are to undergo. It is then
obſerved, that the ſkin firſt opens on the head and back; and out of this
opening they exhibit their real head and eyes, and at length their ſix legs;
whilſt, in the mean time, the hollow and empty ſkin, or ſlough of their
legs, remains firmly fixed in its place. After this, the encloſed creature
creeps forward by degrees; and by this means draws firſt its wings and then
its body out of the ſkin; and proceeding a little <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0824000107:326"/>
farther, ſits at reſt for ſome time, as if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable. During this time,
the wings, which were moiſt and folded, begin by degrees to expand
themſelves, and to make ſmooth and even all thoſe plaits which were laid
againſt each other, like a cloſed fan. The body is likewiſe
inſenſibly extended, until all the limbs have obtained their proper ſize
and dimenſions. All theſe ſurprizing and difficult operations are
accompliſhed by the force of the blood and the circulating humours. The
creature cannot at firſt make uſe of its new wings, and therefore is forced
to ſtay in the ſame place until all its limbs are dried by the
circumambient air. It ſoon, however, begins to enter upon a more noble life
than it had hitherto led in the bottom of the brook; and from creeping ſlowly
and living accidentally, it now wings the air, and makes choice from amidſt
the variety of its proviſions.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, no animal is more amply fitted for motion,
ſubſiſtence and enjoyment. As it haunts and ſeeks after its food flying
in the air, Nature has provided it with two large eyes, which make almoſt the
whole head, and which reſemble glittering mother of pearl. It has alſo four
expanſive ſilver-coloured wings, with which, as with oars, it can turn
itſelf with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0824000107:327"/>

                     <pb facs="tcp:0824000107:329"/> velocity; and to
aſſiſt theſe, it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a very long body, which, like a
rudder, directs its motions. As the wings, are long, and the legs ſhort, they
ſeldom walk, but are ever ſeen either reſting or flying. For this
reaſon, they always chuſe dry branches of trees or ſhrubs to remain on;
and when they have refreſhed themſelves a little, they renew their flight.
Thus they are ſeen adorning the ſummer with a profuſion of beauty,
lightly traverſing the air in a thouſand direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and expanding the
moſt beautiful colours to the ſun. The garden, the foreſt, the hedges,
and the rivulets, are animated by their ſports; and there are few who have
been brought up in the country, who have not employed a part of their childhood
in the purſuit.</p>
                  <p>But while theſe beautiful flies appear to us ſo idly and
innocently employed, they are in fact the greateſt tyrants of the inſect
tribe; and, like the hawk among birds, are only hovering up and down to ſeize
their prey. They are the ſtrongeſt and the moſt courageous of all winged
inſects; nor is there one, how large ſoever, that they will not attack and
devour. The blue fly, the bee, the waſp, and the hornet, make their
conſtant prey; and even the butterfly, that ſpreads ſo large a wing, is
often caught <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0824000107:330"/> and treated without mercy. Their appetite
ſeems to know no bounds; they ſpend the whole day in the purſuit, and
have been ſeen to devour three times their own ſize in the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a
ſingle hour. They ſeize their prey flying with their ſix claws, and tear
it eaſily to pieces with their teeth, which are capable of inflicting
troubleſome wounds.</p>
                  <p>But the males are upon the wing for another purpoſe beſide
that of food, as they are very ſalacious, and ſeek the females with great
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. The ſun no ſooner begins to warm the fields, than the mates are
found aſſiduouſly employed each in ſeeking its mate; and no ſooner
does a female appear, but two or three males are ſeen purſuing and
endeavouring to ſeize her with all their arts and agility. The inſtrument
of generation in the male is placed very different from that of any other
inſect, being not at the end of the tail as in others, but immediately under
the breaſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, at firſt view, incapable of being united
to the ſexual part of the female; which, as in other inſects, lies in the
tail. To perform this junction, Nature has provided the male with a very
peculiar manner of proceeding. As ſoon as he perceives the female, and finds
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficiently near, he ſeizes upon the back <pb n="322" facs="tcp:0824000107:331"/> of her head by ſurprize, and faſtening his claws upon her, turns
round his forky tail, which he faſtens round her neck, and in this manner
fixes himſelf ſo cloſely and firmly, that no efforts can remove him. It
is in vain that ſhe flies from one branch to another and ſettles upon them,
he ſtill keeps fixed, and often continues in this ſituation for three or
four hours ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively. When he flies, ſhe is obliged to fly with
him; but he ſtill directs the way: and though ſhe moves her wings, ſhe
ſeems entirely guided by his motions. As yet, however, the buſineſs of
impregnation is not performed; for to this the female muſt contribute; and
ſhe at laſt ſeems, by the continuance of her conſtraint, to comply:
for, turning up the end of her tail to that part of the breaſt of the male in
which lies the part proper for generation, both inſtruments meet, and the
eggs of the female receive the neceſſary fecundation. An hour or two after
this, ſhe flies to ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring pool, where ſhe depoſites her
eggs, as was already mentioned. There they continue in a reptile ſtate for a
year; and then are changed into a beautiful fly, reſembling the parent.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the Formica Leo, or Lion-Ant.</head>
                  <p>ALTHOUGH this animal properly belongs to no order of
inſects, yet, as it is changed into a fly very much reſembling that
deſcribed in the preceding chapter, it may not be improper to give its
hiſtory here. If we conſider the life of this animal in its different
ſtages of exiſtence, we ſhall find it equally wonderful in all; but as it
changes to a dragon-fly, what we have ſaid of that animal above need not be
repeated here. The ant-lion, when it becomes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of air, in every
reſpect reſembles that which has been already deſcribed; its gloſſy
wings, its voracious appetites, its peculiar manner of generation, are entirely
the ſame. It is in its reptile ſtate that it differs from all other
inſects; and in that ſtate it will be amuſing to purſue its
hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>The ant-lion, in its reptile ſtate, is of the ſize of a
common wood-louſe, but ſomewhat broader. It has a pretty long head and a
roundiſh body, which becomes a little narrower towards the tail. The colour
is a dirty grey, ſpeckled with black, and the body is compoſed 
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0824000107:333"/> of ſeveral flat rings, which ſlip one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It has ſix feet, four of which are fixed to the breaſt and two to the neck.
The head is ſmall and flat, and before there are two little ſmooth horns or
feelers, which are hard, about a quarter of an inch long, and crooked at the
ends. At the baſis of the feelers there are two ſmall black lively eyes, by
which it can ſee the ſmalleſt object, as is eaſily diſcovered by its
ſtarting from every thing that approaches.</p>
                  <p>To a form ſo unpromiſing, and ſo ill provided for the
purpoſes of rapacity, this animal unites the moſt ravenous appetites in
nature; but to mark its imbecillity ſtill ſtronger, as other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals have
wings or feet to enable them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards their prey, the ant-lion is
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided with ſuch aſſiſtance from either. It has legs indeed; but
theſe only enable it to run backward, ſo that it could as ſoon die as
make the ſmalleſt progreſſive motion. Thus, famiſhed and rapacious as
it ever ſeems, its prey muſt come to it, or rather into the ſnare
provided for it, or the inſidious aſſaſſin muſt ſtarve.</p>
                  <p>But Nature, that has denied it ſtrength or ſwiftneſs,
has given it an equivalent in cunning, ſo that no animal fares more
ſumptuouſly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever ſtirring from its retreat. For this 
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0824000107:334"/> purpoſe, it chuſes a dry ſandy place, at the foot
of a wall, or under ſome ſhelter, in order to preſerve its machinations
from the rain. The drieſt and moſt ſandy ſpot is the moſt proper for
it; becauſe a heavy clogged earth would defeat its labour. When it goes about
to dig the hole where it takes its prey, it begins to bend the hinder part of
its body, which is pointed, and thus works backward; making, after ſeveral
attempts, a circular fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which ſerves to mark out the ſize of the hole
it intends making, as the ancients marked out the limits of a city with the
plough. Within this firſt furrow it digs a ſecond; then a third; and
afterwards others, which are always leſs than the preceding. Then it begins
to deepen its hole, ſinking lower and lower into the ſand, which it throws
with its horns, or feelers, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the edges, as we ſee men throw up ſand
in a gravel-pit. Thus, by repeating its labours all round, the ſand is thrown
up in a circle about the edge of the pit, until the whole is quite compleated.
This hole is always formed in a perfect circle; and the pit itſelf
reſembles the inſide of an inverted funnel. When this inſect firſt
leaves the egg and is newly hatched, the firſt pit it makes is very ſmall;
but as it grows bigger, it makes a larger hole; which <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0824000107:335"/> is
deſtined, like a pit-fall, to entrap its prey. It is generally about two
inches deep, and as much in diameter.</p>
                  <p>The work being thus with great labour finiſhed, the
inſidious inſect places itſelf in ambuſh, hiding itſelf at the bottom
under the ſand in ſuch a manner, that its two horns encircle the bottom of
the pit. All the ſides of this pit-fall are made of the moſt looſe and
crumbling materials; ſo that ſcarce any inſect can climb up that has once
got down to the bottom. Conſcious of this, the ant-lion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in patient
expectation, ready to profit by that accident which throws ſome heedleſs
little animal into its den. If then, by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, an ant, a wood-louſe, or
a ſmall cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar walks too near the edge of the precipice, the ſand
gives way beneath them, and they fall to the bottom of the pit, where they meet
inevitable deſtruction. The fall of a ſingle grain of ſand gives the
murderer notice at the bottom of its cave; and it never fails to ſally forth
to ſeize upon its prey. It happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, however, that the ant or the
wood-louſe is too nimble, and runs up the ſides of the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall before the
other can make ready to ſeize it. The ant-lion has then another contrivance,
ſtill more wonderful than the former; for, by means <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0824000107:336"/> of
its broad head and feelers, it has a method of throwing up a ſhower of ſand
which falls upon the ſtruggling captive with tremendous weight, and once more
cruſhes it down to the bottom. When the inſect is once fallen thus low, no
efforts can retrieve or releaſe it; the ant-lion ſeizes it with its
feelers, which are hollow, and darting them both into its body, ſucks out all
the little animal's juices with the utmoſt rapacity.</p>
                  <p>When the prey is thus reduced to a huſk, and nothing but the
external form remains, the next care of the murderer is to remove the body from
its cell; ſince the appearance of dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes might forewarn other
inſects of the danger of the place. The inſect, therefore, takes up the
waſted trunk with its feelers, and throws it, with wonderful ſtrength, at
leaſt ſix inches from the edge of its hole; and then patiently ſets about
mending the breaches which its forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications had received in the laſt
engagement. Nothing can abate its induſtry, its vigilance, its patience, or
its rapacity. It will work for a week together to make its pit-fall; it will
continue upon the watch for more than a month, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expecting the
approach of its prey; and if it comes in greater quantities than is needful,
yet ſtill the little voracious creature will quit the <pb n="328" facs="tcp:0824000107:337"/>
inſect it has newly killed, and leave it half eaten, to kill and attack any
other that happens to fall within the ſphere of its malignity: yet, though
ſo voracious, it is ſurprizingly patient of hunger; ſome of them having
been kept in a box with ſand for ſix months and upwards, without feeding at
all.</p>
                  <p>When the ant-lion attains a certain age, in which it is to
change into another form, it then leaves off its uſual rapacious habits, but
keeps on its induſtry. It no longer continues to make pits, but furrows up
the ſand all round in an irregular manner; teſtifying thoſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and
violent agitations which moſt inſects exhibit previous to their
transformation. Theſe animals are produced in autumn, and generally live a
year, and perhaps two, before they aſſume a winged form. Certain it is,
that they are found at the end of winter of all ſizes; and it would ſeem
that many of the ſmaller kinds had not yet attained ſufficient maturity for
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Be this as it may, when the time of change approaches, if
the inſect finds its little cell convenient, it ſeeks no other: if it is
obliged to remove, after furrowing up the ſand, it hides itſelf under it,
horns and all. It there ſpins a thread, in the manner of the ſpider; which
being made of a glutinous ſubſtance, and being humid <pb n="329" facs="tcp:0824000107:338"/>
from the moiſture of its body, ſticks to the little particles of ſand
among which it is ſpun; and in proportion as it is thus excluded, the
inſect rolls up its web, ſand and all, into a ball, of which itſelf is
the center. This ball is about half an inch in diameter; and within it the
inſect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in an apartment ſufficiently ſpacious for all its
motions. The outſide is compoſed of ſand and ſilk; the inſide is
lined with ſilk only, of a fine pearl colour, extremely delicate, and
perfectly beautiful. But though the work is ſo curious within, it exhibits
nothing to external appearance, but a lump of ſand; and thus eſcapes the
ſearch of birds, that might otherwiſe diſturb the inhabitant within.</p>
                  <p>The inſect continues thus ſhut up for ſix weeks or two
months; and gradually parts with its eyes, its feelers, its feet, and its
ſkin; all which are thruſt into a corner of the inner apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like a
rag. The inſect then appears almoſt in its winged ſtate, except that
there is a thin ſkin which wraps up the wings, and that appears to be nothing
elſe but a liquor dried on their outſide. Still, however, the little animal
is too delicate and tender to venture from its retreat; but continues
encloſed for ſome time longer: at length, when the members of this new
inſect have acquired the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0824000107:339"/> and vigour, it tears open its lodging, and breaks through its wall.
For this purpoſe it has two teeth, like thoſe of graſhoppers, with which
it eats through, and enlarges the opening, till it gets out. Its body, which is
turned like a ſcrew, takes up no more than the ſpace of a quarter of an
inch; but when it is unfolded, it becomes half an inch in length; while its
wings, that ſeemed to occupy the ſmalleſt ſpace, in two minutes time
unfold, and become longer than the body. In ſhort, it becomes a large and
beautiful fly of the libellula kind, with a long, ſlender body, of a brown
colour; a ſmall head, with large bright eyes, long ſlender legs, and four
large tranſparent, reticulated wings. The reſt of its habits reſemble
that inſect whoſe form it bears; except, that inſtead of dropping its
eggs in the water, it depoſites them in ſand, where they are ſoon hatched
into that rapacious inſect ſo juſtly admired for its method of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its prey.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Graſshopper, the Locuſt, the Cicada,
the Cricket, and the Mole Cricket.</head>
                  <p>BELONGING to the ſecond order of inſects, we find a tribe
of little animals, which, though differing in ſize and colour, ſtrongly
reſemble each other in figure, appetites, nature, and transformation. But
though they all appear of one family, yet man has been taught to hold them in
different eſtimation; for while ſome of this tribe amuſe him with their
chirpings, and baniſh ſolitude from the fields, others come in ſwarms,
eat up every thing that is green, and in a ſingle night convert the moſt
delightful landſcape into a dreary waſte. However, if theſe animals be
ſeparately conſidered, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring locuſt is not in the leaſt more
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous than the muſical graſshopper; the only difference is, that
one ſpecies come for food in a ſwarm, the other feeds ſingly.</p>
                  <p>That animal which is called the graſshopper with us, differs
greatly from the cicada of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; for as our inſect is active enough in
hopping through the long graſs, from whence it has taken its name, the cicada
had not this <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0824000107:341"/> power, but either walked or flew. The
little hiſſing note alſo of our graſshopper is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the
ſong of the cicada, which was louder and far more muſical. The manner in
which this note is produced by the two animals is very different; for the
cicada makes it by a kind of buckler, which the male has beneath its belly; the
graſshopper by a tranſparent membrane that covers an hole at the baſe of
its wings. There is ſtill a greater variety in all theſe with regard to
ſhape and colour. Some are green, ſome black, ſome livid, and ſome
variegated; but many of them do not ſhew all their colours till they fly.
Some have long legs, ſome ſhort; ſome with more joints, others with
fewer. Some ſing, others are mute; ſome are innocent, doing no damage to
the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; while others do ſuch prodigious miſchief, that they are
looked upon in ſome countries as one of the terrible ſcourges of the
incenſed Divinity.</p>
                  <p>Of this variegated tribe, the little graſshopper that breeds
in ſuch plenty in every meadow, and that continues its chirping through the
ſummer, is beſt known to us; and by having its hiſtory we ſhall be
poſſeſſed of that of all the reſt. This animal is of the colour of
green leaves, except a line of brown which ſtreaks <pb n="333" facs="tcp:0824000107:342"/> the
back, and two pale lines under the belly and behind the legs. It may be divided
into the head, the corſlet, and the belly. The head is oblong, regarding the
earth, and bearing ſome reſemblance to that of a horſe. Its mouth is
covered by a kind of round buckler jutting over it, and armed with teeth of a
brown co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, hooked at the points. Within the mouth is perceivable a large
reddiſh tongue, and fixed to the lower jaw. The feelers or horns are very
long, tapering off to a point; and the eyes are like two black ſpecks, a
little prominent. The corſlet is elevated, narrow, armed above and below, by
two ſerrated ſpines. The back is armed with a ſtrong buckler, to which
the muſcles of the legs are firmly bound, and round theſe muſcles are
ſeen the veſſels by which the animal breathes, as white as ſnow. The
laſt pair of legs are much longer and ſtronger than the firſt two pair,
fortified by thick muſcles, and very well formed for leaping. It has four
wings; the anterior ones ſpringing from the ſecond pair of legs, the
poſterior from the third pair The hinder wings are much finer and more
expanſive than the foremoſt, and are the principal inſtruments of its
flight. The belly is conſiderably large, compoſed of eight rings, and
terminated by a forky tail, covered with <pb n="334" facs="tcp:0824000107:343"/> down, like the
tail of a rat. When examined internally, beſides the gullet, we diſcover a
ſmall ſtomach; and behind that a very large one, wrinkled and furrowed
within ſide: lower down there is ſtill a third; ſo that it is not without
reaſon that all the animals of this order are ſaid to chew the cud, as they
ſo much reſemble rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant animals in their internal conformation.</p>
                  <p>A ſhort time after the graſshopper aſſumes its wings,
it fills the meadow with its note; which, like that among birds, is a call to
court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The male only of this tribe is vocal; and, upon examining at the
baſe of the wings, there will be found a little hole in its body, covered
with a fine tranſparent membrane. This is thought, by Linnaeus, to be the
inſtrument it employs in ſinging; but others are of opinion the ſound is
produced by rubbing its hinder legs againſt each other: however this be, the
note of one male is ſeldom heard, but it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by another; and the two
little animals, after many mutual inſults of this kind, are ſeen to meet
and fight deſperately. The female is generally the reward of victory; for,
after the combat, the male ſeizes her with his teeth behind the neck, and
thus keeps her for ſeveral hours, till the buſineſs of fecundation is
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. They are at that time ſo ſtrongly <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0824000107:344"/>
united, that they can ſcarcely be ſeparated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tearing aſunder.
Towards the latter end of autumn the female prepares to depoſite her burthen;
and her body is then ſeen greatly diſtended with her eggs, which ſhe
carries to the number of an hundred and fifty. In order to make a proper
lodgement in the earth for them, Nature has furniſhed her with an
inſtrument at her tail, ſomewhat reſembling a two-edged ſword, which
ſhe can ſheathe and unſheathe at pleaſure: with this ſhe pierces the
earth as deep as ſhe is able; and into the hole which her inſtrument has
made, ſhe depoſites her eggs, one after the other.</p>
                  <p>Having thus provided for the continuation of her poſterity,
the animal herſelf does not long ſurvive; but, as the winter approaches,
ſhe dries up, ſeems to feel the effects of age, and dies from a total
decay. Some, however, aſſert, that ſhe is killed by the cold; and others,
that ſhe is eaten by worms: but certain it is, that neither the male nor
female are ever ſeen to ſurvive the winter. In the mean time the eggs which
have been depoſited, continue unaltered, either by the ſeverity of the
ſeaſon, or the retardation of the ſpring. They are of an oval figure,
white, and of the conſiſtence of horn: their ſize nearly equals that of a
grain of aniſe: they are enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0824000107:345"/> in the body within
a covering, branched all over with veins and arteries; and when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, they
crack, on being preſſed between the fingers: their ſubſtance within is
a whitiſh, viſcous and tranſparent fluid. In this manner they remain
depoſited beneath the ſurface of the earth, during the whole winter; till
the genial return of ſpring begins to vivify and hatch them. The ſun, with
its warmth, beginning to animate all nature, the inſect eggs feel its benign
influence; and generally, about the beginning of May, every egg produces an
inſect, about the ſize of a flea. Theſe at firſt are of a whitiſh
colour; at the end of two or three days they turn black; and ſoon after they
become of a reddiſh brown. They appear, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, like
graſshoppers wanting wings; and hop among the graſs, as ſoon as excluded,
with great agility.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſtill they are by no means arrived at their ſtate of
full perfection; although they bear a ſtrong reſemblance to the animal in
its perfect form. They want, or ſeem to want the wings, which they are at
laſt ſeen to aſſume; and can only hop among the graſs, without being
able to fly. The wings, however, are not wanting, but are concealed within four
little bunches, that ſeem to deform the ſides of the animal: 
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0824000107:346"/> there they lie rolled up in a moſt curious manner; and
occupying a ſmaller ſpace than one could conceive who ſaw them extended.
Indeed, all inſects, whatever tranſmutations they ſeem to undergo, are
yet brought forth with thoſe very limbs, parts and wings, which they
afterwards ſeem to acquire. In the moſt helpleſs cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar, there is
ſtill to be ſeen the rudiments of that beautiful plumage which it
afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands when a butterfly; and though many new parts ſeem unfolded
to the view, the animal acquires none but ſuch as it was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
poſſeſſed of. The graſshopper, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though ſeemingly without
wings, is in reality, from the firſt, poſſeſſed of thoſe
inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and only waits for ſufficient force to break the bonds that
hold them folded up, and to give them their full expanſion.</p>
                  <p>The graſshopper, that for above twenty days from its
excluſion has continued without the uſe of its wings, which were folded up
to its body, at length prepares for its emancipation, and for a life of greater
liberty and pleaſure. To make the proper diſpoſitions for the
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching change, it ceaſes from its graſſy food, and ſeeks about
for a convenient place, beneath ſome thorn or thiſtle, that may protect it
from an accidental ſhower. The ſame laborious <pb n="338" facs="tcp:0824000107:347"/>
writhings and workings, heavings and palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which we have remarked in
every other inſect upon an approaching change, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in this. It
ſwells up its head and neck; it then ſeems to draw them in again; and thus
alternately, for ſome time, it exerts its powers to get free. At length, the
ſkin covering the head and breaſt is ſeen dividing above the neck; the
head is ſeen iſſuing out firſt from the burſting ſkin; the efforts
ſtill continuing, the other parts follow ſucceſſively; ſo that the
little animal, with its long feelers, legs and all, works its way from the old
ſkin, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains fixed to the thiſtle or the thorn. It is, indeed,
inconceivable how the inſect can thus extricate itſelf from ſo exact a
ſheath as that which covered every part of its body.</p>
                  <p>The graſshopper, thus diſengaged from its outer ſkin,
appears in its perfect form; but then ſo feeble, and its body ſo ſoft and
tender, that it may be molded like wax. It is no longer of that obſcure
colour which it exhibited before, but a greeniſh white, which becomes more
vivid as the moiſture on the ſurface is dried away. Still, however, the
animal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to ſhew no ſigns of life, but appears quite ſpent and
fatigued with its labour for more than an hour together. During this time, 
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0824000107:348"/> the body is drying, and the wings unfolding to their
greateſt expanſion, and the curious obſerver will perceive them, fold
after fold, opening to the ſun, till at laſt they become longer than the
two hinder legs. The inſect's body alſo is lengthened during this
operation, and it becomes much more beautiful than before.</p>
                  <p>Theſe inſects are generally vocal in the midſt of
ſummer; and they are heard at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting much louder than during the
heats of the day. They are fed upon graſs; and, if their belly be
preſſed, they will be ſeen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the juices of the plants they have
laſt fed upon. Though unwilling to fly, and ſlow in flight, particularly
when the weather is moiſt or cool, they are ſometimes ſeen to fly to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtances. If they are caught by one of the hinder legs, they
quickly diſengage themſelves from it, and leave the leg behind them. This,
however, does not grow again, as with crabs or ſpiders; for as they are
animals but of a ſingle year's continuance, they have not ſufficient time
for repairing thoſe accidental misfortunes. The loſs of their leg alſo
prevents them from flying; for, being unable to lift themſelves in the air,
they have not room upon the ground for the proper expanſion of their 
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0824000107:349"/> wings. If they be handled roughly, they will bite very
fiercely; and when they fly, they make a noiſe with their wings. They
generally keep in the plain, where the graſs is luxuriant, and the ground
rich and fertile: there they depoſite their eggs, particularly in thoſe
cracks which are formed by the heat of the ſun.</p>
                  <p>Such are the habits and nature of thoſe little vocal
inſects, that ſwarm in our meadows, and enliven the landſcape. The larger
kinds only differ from them in ſize, in rapidity of flight, and the powers of
injuring mankind, by ſwarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the productions of the earth. The
quantity of graſs which a few graſshoppers that ſport in the fields can
deſtroy is trifling; but when a ſwarm of locuſts, two or three miles
long, and ſeveral yards deep, ſettle upon a field, the conſequences are
frightful. The annals of every country are marked with the devaſtation which
ſuch a multitude of inſects produces; and though they ſeldom viſit
Europe in ſuch dangerous ſwarms as formerly, yet, in ſome of the
ſouthern kingdoms, they are ſtill formidable. Thoſe which have at
uncertain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals viſited Europe, in our memory, are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have
come from Africa, and the animal is called the Great Brown Locuſt. It was
ſeen in ſeveral parts of England in the year 1748, and 
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0824000107:350"/> many dreadful conſequences were apprehended from its
appearance. This inſect is about three inches long; and has two horns or
feelers, an inch in length. The head and horns are of a browniſh colour; it
is blue about the mouth, as alſo on the inſide of the larger legs. The
ſhield that covers the back is greeniſh; and the upper ſide of the body
brown, ſpotted with black, and the under ſide purple. The upper wings are
brown, with ſmall duſky ſpots, with one larger at the tips; the under
wings are more tranſparent, and of a light brown, tinctured with green, but
there is a dark cloud of ſpots near the tips. This is that inſect that has
threatened us ſo often with its viſitations; and that is ſo truly
terrible in the countries where it is bred. There is no animal in the creation
that multiplies ſo faſt as theſe, if the ſun be warm, and the ſoil in
which their eggs are depoſited be dry. Happily for us, the coldneſs of our
climate, and the humidity of our ſoil, are no way favourable to their
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; and as they are but the animals of a year, they viſit us and
periſh.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture, which was written in a country where the
locuſt made a diſtinguiſhed feature in the picture of Nature, has given
us ſeveral very ſtriking images of this animal's numbers 
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0824000107:351"/> and rapacity. It compares an army, where the numbers are
almoſt infinite, to a ſwarm of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts: it deſcribes them as riſing
out of the earth, where they are produced; as purſuing a ſettled march to
deſtroy the fruits of the earth, and co-operate with divine indignation.</p>
                  <p>When the locuſts take the field, as we are aſſured, they
have a leader at their head, whoſe flight they obſerve, and pay a ſtrict
attention to all his motions. They appear, at a diſtance, like a black cloud,
which, as it approaches, gathers upon the horizon, and almoſt hides the light
of the day. It often happens that the huſbandman ſees this imminent
calamity paſs away without doing him any miſchief; and the whole ſwarm
proceed onward, to ſettle upon the labours of ſome leſs fortunate
country. But wretched is the diſtrict upon which they ſettle: they ravage
the meadow and the paſture ground; ſtrip the trees of their leaves, and the
garden of its beauty: the viſitation of a few minutes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the
expectations of a year; and a famine but too frequently enſues. In their
native tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical climates they are not ſo dreadful as in the more ſouthern
parts of Europe. There, though the plain and the foreſt be ſtripped of
their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, the power of vegetation is ſo great, that an interval of
three or four days repairs the <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0824000107:352"/> calamity: but our verdure
is the livery of a ſeaſon; and we muſt wait till the enſuing ſpring
repairs the damage. Beſides, in their long flights to this part of the world,
they are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed by the tediouſneſs of their journey, and are therefore
more voracious wherever they happen to ſettle. But it is not by what they
devour that they do ſo much damage as by what they deſtroy. Their very bite
is thought to contaminate the plant, and to prevent its vegetation. To uſe
the expreſſion of the huſbandman, they burn whatever they touch; and
leave the marks of their devaſtation for two or three years enſuing. But if
they be noxious while living, they are ſtill more ſo when dead; for
wherever they fall, they infect the air in ſuch a manner that the ſmell is
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable. Oroſius tells us, that in the year of the world 3800, there
was an incredible number of locuſts which infected Africa; and, after having
eaten up every thing that was green, they flew off and were drowned in the
African ſea; where they cauſed ſuch a ſtench, that the putrefying
bodies of hundreds of thouſands of men could not equal it.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1690, a cloud of locuſts was ſeen to enter
Ruſſia in three different places; and from thence to ſpread themſelves
over <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0824000107:353"/> Poland and Lithuania, in ſuch aſtoniſhing
mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, that the air was darkened, and the earth covered with their
numbers. In ſome places they were ſeen lying dead, heaped upon each other
four feet deep; in others, they covered the ſurface like a black cloth: the
trees bent beneath their weight; and the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which the country
ſuſtained exceeded computation. In Barbary their numbers are formidable,
and their viſits are frequent. In the year 1724, Doctor Shaw was a witneſs
in that country of their devaſtations. Their firſt appearance was about the
latter end of March, when the wind had been ſoutherly for ſome time. In the
beginning of April, their numbers were ſo vaſtly encreaſed, that in the
heat of the day they formed themſelves into large ſwarms, which appeared
like clouds, and darkened the ſun. In the middle of May they began to
diſappear, retiring into the plains to depoſit their eggs. In the next
month, being June, the young brood began to make their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, forming
many compact bodies of ſeveral hundred yards ſquare; which afterwards
march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward, climbed the trees, walls, and houſes, eating every thing
that was green in their way. The inhabitants, to ſtop their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, laid
trenches all over their fields and <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0824000107:354"/> gardens, filling them
with water. Some placed large quantities of heath, ſtubble, and ſuch like
combuſtible matter, in rows, and ſet them on fire on the approach of the
locuſts. But all this was to no purpoſe; for the trenches were quickly
filled up, and the fires put out by the vaſt number of ſwarms that
ſucceeded each other. A day or two after one of theſe was in motion, others
that were juſt hatched came to glean after them, gnawing off the young
branches and the very bark of the trees. Having lived near a month in this
manner, they arrived at their full growth, and threw off their worm-like
ſtate, by caſting their ſkins. To prepare themſelves for this change,
they fixed their hinder feet to ſome buſh or twig, or corner of a ſtone,
when immediately, by an undulating motion uſed on this occaſion, their
heads would firſt appear, and ſoon after the reſt of their bodies. The
whole transformation was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſeven or eight minutes time; after
which, they were a little while in a languiſhing condition; but as ſoon as
the ſun and air had hardened their wings, and dried up the moiſture that
remained after caſting off their ſloughs, they returned again to their
former greedineſs, with an addition both of ſtrength and agility. But they
did not continue long in this ſtate <pb n="346" facs="tcp:0824000107:355"/> before they were
entirely diſperſed; after laying their eggs, directing their courſe
northward, and probably periſhed in the ſea. It is ſaid that the holes
theſe animals make, to depoſite their eggs, are four feet deep in the
ground; where the eggs are depoſited, about fourſcore in number, of the
ſize of caraway comfits, and bundled up together in cluſters.</p>
                  <p>It would be endleſs to recount all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which
theſe famiſhed inſects have at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times occaſioned; but what
can have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to take ſuch diſtant flights, when they come into
Europe, is not ſo eaſy to be accounted for. It ſeems moſt probable,
that by means of a very dry ſeaſon in the heart of Africa, they are
propagated in ſuch numbers, that the vegetables of the ſpot where they are
produced are not ſufficient to ſuſtain them. Thus being obliged to find
out other countries, they traverſe the ſandy deſerts, where they can find
no ſuſtenance; ſtill meeting with nothing to allure them from their
height, they proceed forward acroſs the ſea, and thus come into Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
where they alight upon the firſt green paſtures that occur.</p>
                  <p>In ſome parts of the world, the inhabitants turn what
ſeems a plague to their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Locuſts are eaten by the natives in
many <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0824000107:356"/> kingdoms of the eaſt; and are caught in ſmall
nets provided for that purpoſe. They parch them over the fire in an earthen
pan; and when their wings and legs are fallen off, they turn reddiſh, of the
colour of boiled ſhrimps. Dampier has eat them thus prepared, and thinks them
a tolerable diſh. The natives of Barbary alſo eat them fried with ſalt;
and they are ſaid to taſte like cray-fiſh.</p>
                  <p>There is a locuſt in Tonquin, about the bigneſs of the top
of a man's finger, and as long as the firſt joint. It breeds in the earth, in
low grounds; and in the months of January and February, which is the ſeaſon
for taking them, they iſſue from the earth in vaſt ſwarms. At firſt
they can hardly fly, ſo that they often fall into the rivers in great
numbers: however, the natives in theſe months watch the rivers, and take them
up in multitudes in ſmall nets. They either eat them freſh, broiled on the
coals, or pickle them for keeping. They are conſidered as a great delicacy in
that part of the world, as well by the rich as the poor. In the countries where
they are eaten, they are regularly brought to market, and ſold as larks or
quails in Europe. They muſt have been a common food with the Jews, as
Moſes, in the book of Leviticus, permits them to eat <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0824000107:357"/>
four different kinds of this animal, which he takes care to ſpecify. This
diſh, however, has not yet made its way into the kitchens of the luxurious in
Europe; and though we may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the delicacies of the eaſt, we are as yet
happily deprived of the powers of imitation.</p>
                  <p>Of all animals, however, of this noxious tribe, the Great
Weſt-Indian Locuſt, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually conſidered, is the moſt formidable.
It is about the thickneſs of the barrel of a gooſe-quill, and the body is
divided into nine or ten joints, in the whole about ſix or ſeven inches
long. It has two ſmall eyes, ſtanding out of the head like thoſe of
crabs, and two feelers like long hair. The whole body is ſtudded with ſmall
excreſcences, which are not much bigger than the points of pins. The ſhape
is roundiſh, and the body diminiſhes in circumference to the tail, which is
forked into two horns. Between theſe, there is a ſort of a ſheath
containing a ſmall dangerous ſting. If any perſon happens to touch this
inſect he is ſure to be ſtung; and is immediately taken with a
ſhivering and trembling all over the body; which, however, may ſoon be put
a ſtop to, by rubbing the place that was affected with a little palm oil.</p>
                  <p>From the locuſt we deſcend to the cricket, 
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0824000107:358"/> which is a very inoffenſive and pretty animal. Though
there be a ſpecies of this inſect that lives entirely in the woods and
fields, yet that with which we are beſt acquainted is the Houſe-cricket,
whoſe voice is ſo well known behind a country fire in a winter's evening.
There is ſomething ſo unuſual in hearing a ſound while we do not ſee
the animal producing it, nor diſcover the place from whence it comes, that
among the country people the chirping of the cricket is always held ominous;
and whether it deſerts the fire-ſide, or pays an unexpected viſit, the
credulous peaſantry always find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be afraid of. In general,
however, the killing of a cricket is conſidered as a moſt unlucky omen; and
though their company is not much deſired, yet no methods muſt be taken to
remove them.</p>
                  <p>The cricket very much reſembles the graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper in its
ſhape, its manner of ruminating, its voice, its leaping, and methods of
propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. It differs in its colour, which is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly of a ruſty brown;
in its food, which is more various; and in its place of reſidence, which is
moſt uſually in the warmeſt chinks behind a country hearth. They are, in
ſome meaſure, obliged to the bad maſonry employed in making peaſants
houſes for their retreats. <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0824000107:359"/> The ſmalleſt chink
ſerves to give them ſhelter; and where they once make their abode they are
ſure to propagate. They are of a moſt chilly nature, ſeldom leaving the
fire-ſide; and, if undiſturbed, are ſeen to hop from their retreats to
chirrup at the blaze in the chimney. The wood-cricket is the moſt timorous
animal in nature; but the chimney-cricket, being uſed to noiſes,
diſregards not only thoſe, but the appearance of people near it. Whether
the voice of this animal is formed in the ſame manner with that of the
graſshopper, by a fine membrane at the baſe of the wings, which is moved by
a muſcle, and which being coiled up, gives a ſound like a quail-pipe is not
yet aſcertained; nor do we well know the uſe of this voice, ſince
anatomical inſpection has not yet been able to diſcover the ſmalleſt
organs of hearing. Still, however, we can make no doubt of their power of
diſtinguiſhing ſounds, though probably not in the ſame manner with the
more perfect ranks of nature. Certain it is that I have often heard them call,
and this call was as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly anſwered by another, although none but the
males are vocal.</p>
                  <p>As the cricket lives chiefly in the dark, ſo its eyes ſeem
formed for the gloomineſs of its abode; and thoſe who would ſurprize it,
have <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0824000107:360"/> only to light a candle unexpectedly; by which it is
dazzled, and cannot find the way back to its retreat. It is a very voracious
little animal, and will eat bread, flower, and meat; but it is particularly
fond of ſugar. They never drink, but keep for months together at the back of
the chimney, where they could poſſibly have had no moiſture. The warmth
of their ſituation only ſerves to encreaſe their mirth and loquacity.
Except in the very coldeſt weather, they never ceaſe their chirruping, but
continue that little piercing note, which is as pleaſing to ſome as it is
diſagreeable to others. The great Scaliger was particularly delighted with
the chirruping of crickets, and kept ſeveral of them for his amuſement,
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in a box, which he placed in a warm ſituation. Others, on the
contrary, think there is ſomething ominous and melancholly in the ſound,
and uſe every endeavour to baniſh this inſect from their houſes.
Ledelius tells us of a woman who was very much incommoded by crickets, and
tried, but in vain, every method of baniſhing them from her houſe. She at
laſt accidentally ſucceeded; for having one day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited ſeveral gueſts
to her houſe, where there was a wedding, in order to encreaſe the
feſtivity of the entertainment, ſhe procured drums and 
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0824000107:361"/> trumpets to entertain them. The noiſe of theſe was
ſo much greater than what the little animals were uſed to, that they
inſtantly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their ſituation, and were never heard in that
manſion more.</p>
                  <p>But of all the cricket kind, that which is called the
Mole-Cricket is the moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. This animal is the largeſt of all
the inſects with which we are acquainted in this country, being two inches
and an half in length, and three quarters of an inch in breadth. The colour is
of a duſky brown; and at the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the tail there are two hairy
excreſcences, reſembling in ſome ſenſe the tail of a mouſe. The
body conſiſts of eightſcaly joints or ſeparate folds, is brown on the
upper part, and more deeply tinged below. The wings are long, narrow, and
terminate in a ſharp point, each having a blackiſh line running down it:
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when they are extended, they appear to be much broader than could at
firſt ſight be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. The ſhield of the breaſt is of a firm
texture, of a blackiſh colour and hairy. The fore-feet, which are this
animal's principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of burrowing into the earth, are ſtrong,
webbed, and hairy; it generally, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, runs backward; but it is commonly
under ground, where it burrows even faſter than a <pb n="353" facs="tcp:0824000107:362"/>
mole. It is thought alſo to be amphibious; and capable of living under water,
as well as under ground.</p>
                  <p>Of all inſects this is the moſt deteſted by gardeners,
as it chiefly reſides in that ground which lies light, and where it finds
ſufficient plenty under the ſurface. Thus, in a ſingle night's time, it
will run along a furrow which has been newly ſown, and rob it of all its
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. Its legs are formed in ſuch a manner that it can penetrate the
earth in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; before, behind, and above it. At night it ventures
from its underground habitation, and, like the cricket, has its chirping call.
When the female is fecundated, ſhe makes a cell of clammy earth, the inſide
of which is large enough to hold two hazle-nuts; and in this ſhe lays her
eggs. The whole neſt is about the ſize of a common hen's egg, cloſed up
on every ſide, and well defended from the ſmalleſt breath of air. The
eggs generally amount to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of an hundred and fifty, being white, and
about the ſize of a carraway comfit. They are thus carefully covered, as well
to defend them from the injuries of the weather, as from the attacks of the
black-beetle; that being itſelf an underground inhabitant, would, but for
this precaution, devour or deſtroy them. To prevent <pb n="354" facs="tcp:0824000107:363"/>
this, the female mole cricket is often poſted as a centinel near the neſt,
and when the black invader plunges in to ſeize its prey, the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
inſect ſeizes him behind, and inſtantly bites him in two.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can exceed the care and aſſiduity which theſe
animals exhibit in the preſervation of their young. Wherever the neſt is
placed, there ſeems to be a fortification, avenues and entrenchments, drawn
round it: there are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs winding ways that lead to it, and a ditch
drawn about it, which few of its inſect enemies are able to paſs. But their
care is not confined to this only; for at the approach of winter they carry
their neſt entirely away, and ſink it deeper in the ground, ſo that the
froſt can have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in retarding the young brood from coming to
maturity. As the weather grows milder, they raiſe their magazines in
propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; till, at laſt, they bring it as near the ſurface as they can,
to receive the genial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the ſun, without wholly expoſing it to
view: yet, ſhould the froſt unexpectedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, they ſink it agin as
before.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Of the Earwig, the Froth Inſect, and ſome
others belonging to the ſecond Order of Inſects.</head>
                  <p>WE ſhould ſtill keep in memory that all inſects of the
ſecond order, though not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced quite perfect from the egg, yet want very
little of their perfection, and require but a very ſmall change to arrive at
that ſtate which fits them for flight and generation. The natural functions
in theſe are never ſuſpended: from the inſtant they leave the egg, they
continue to eat, to move, to leap, and purſue their prey: a ſlight change
enſues; a ſkin that encloſed a part of their body and limbs, burſts
behind, like a woman's ſtays, and gives freedom to a ſet of wings, with
which the animal expatiates, and flies in purſuit of its mate.</p>
                  <p>Of all this claſs of inſects, the earwig under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes the
ſmalleſt change. This animal is ſo common, that it ſcarce needs a
deſcription: its ſwiftneſs in the reptile ſtate is not leſs
remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than its indefatigable velocity when upon the wing. That it muſt
be very prolific, appears from its numbers; and that it is very harmleſs, 
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0824000107:365"/> every one's experience can readily teſtify. It is
provided with ſix feet, and two feelers: the tail is forked; and with this it
often attempts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend itſelf againſt every aſſailant. But its
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts are only the threats of impotence; they draw down the reſentment of
powerful animals, but no way ſerve to defend it. The deformity of its figure,
and its ſlender make, have alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it to an imputation, which,
though en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely founded in prejudice, has more than once procured its
deſtruction. It is ſuppoſed, as the name imports, that it often enters
into the ears of people ſleeping; thus cauſing madneſs, from the
intolerable pain, and ſoon after death itſelf. Indeed, the French name,
which ſignifies the Ear-piercer, urges the calumny againſt this harmleſs
inſect, in very plain terms: yet nothing can be more unjuſt; the ear is
already filled with a ſubſtance which prevents any inſect from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering;
and beſides, it is well lined and defended with membranes, which would keep
out any little animal, even though the ear-wax were away. Theſe reproaches,
therefore, are entirely groundleſs: but it were well if the accuſations
which gardeners bring againſt the earwig, were as ſlightly founded. There
is nothing more certain than that it lives among flowers, and deſtroys them.
When fruit alſo has been <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0824000107:366"/> wounded by flies, the earwig
generally comes in for a ſecond feaſt, and ſucks thoſe juices which
they firſt began to broach. Still, however, this inſect is not ſo noxious
as it would ſeem; and ſeldom is found but where the miſchief has been
originally begun by others. Like all of this claſs, the earwig is hatched
from an egg. As there are various kinds of this animal, ſo they chuſe
different places to breed in: in general, however, they lay their eggs under
the bark of plants, or in the clefts of trees, when beginning to decay. They
proceed from the egg in that reptile ſtate in which they are moſt commonly
ſeen; and, as they grow larger, the wings bound under the ſkin begin to
burgeon. It is amazing how very little room four large wings take up before
they are protruded; for no perſon could ever conceive ſuch an expanſion
of natural drapery could be rolled up in ſo ſmall a pacquet. The ſheath
in which they are enveloped, folds and covers them ſo neatly, that the animal
ſeems quite deſtitute of wings<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Swammerdam, p.
114.</bibl>
                     </note>; and even when they are burſt from their confinement, the
animal, by the power of the muſcles and joints which it has in the middle of
its wings, can cloſely fold them into a very narrow compaſs. When the
earwig has become a winged inſect, it flies in <pb n="358" facs="tcp:0824000107:367"/>
purſuit of the female, ceaſing to feed, and is wholly employed in the
buſineſs of propagation. It lives, in its winged ſtate, but a few days;
and having taken care for the continuance of poſterity, dries up, and dies,
to all appearance conſumptive.</p>
                  <p>To this order of inſects we may alſo refer the Cuckow
Spit, or Froth Worm, that is often found hid in that frothy matter which we
find on the ſurface of plants. It has an oblong, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe body; and a large
head, with ſmall eyes. The external wings, for it has four, are of a duſky
brown colour, marked with two white ſpots: the head is black. The ſpume in
which it is found wallowing, is all of its own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and very much
reſembles frothy ſpittle. It proceeds from the vent of the animal, and
other parts of the body; and if it be wiped away, a new quantity will be
quickly ſeen ejected from the little animal's body. Within this ſpume it is
ſeen in time to acquire four tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles on its back, wherein the wings are
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed: theſe burſting from a reptile, it becomes a winged animal; and
thus rendered perfect, it flies to meet its mate, and propagate its kind.</p>
                  <p>The Water Tipula alſo belongs to this claſs. It has an
oblong ſlender body, with four feet fixed upon the breaſt, and four feelers
near the <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0824000107:368"/> mouth. It has four weak wings, which do not at
all ſeem proper for flying, but leaping only. But what this inſect chiefly
demands our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention for is, the wonderful lightneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it runs on
the ſurface of the water, ſo as ſcarcely to put it in motion. It is
ſometimes ſeen in rivers, and on their banks, eſpecially under ſhady
trees; and generally in ſwarms of ſeveral together.</p>
                  <p>The Common Water-Flie alſo breeds in the ſame manner with
thoſe above-mentioned. This animal is by ſome called the Notonecta,
becauſe it does not ſwim, in the uſual manner, upon its belly, but on its
back: nor can we help ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring that fitneſs in this inſect for its
ſituation, as it feeds on the under-ſide of plants which grow on the
ſurface of the water; and therefore it is thus formed with its mouth upwards,
to take its food with greater convenience and eaſe.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo add the Water-Scorpion, which is a large
inſect, being near an inch in length, and about half an inch in breadth. Its
body is nearly oval, but very flat and thin; and its tail long and pointed. The
head is ſmall; and the feelers appear like legs, reſembling the claws of a
ſcorpion, but without ſharp points. This inſect is generally found in
ponds; and is, of all others, the moſt tyrannical and rapacious. 
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0824000107:369"/> It deſtroys, like a wolf among ſheep, twenty times
as many as its hunger requires. One of theſe, when put into a baſon of
water, in which were thirty or forty worms of the libellula kind, each as large
as itſelf, deſtroyed them all in a few minutes; getting on their backs, and
pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with its trunk through their body. Theſe animals, however, though
ſo formidable to others, are nevertheleſs themſelves greatly overrun with
a little kind of louſe, about the ſize of a nit, which very probably repays
the injury which the water-ſcorpion inflicts upon others.</p>
                  <p>The water-ſcorpions live in the water by day; out of which
they riſe in the duſk of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the air, and ſo flying from
place to place, often betake themſelves, in queſt of food, to other waters.
The inſect, before its wings are grown, remains in the place where it was
produced; but when come to its ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſallies forth in
ſearch of a companion of the other ſex, in order to continue its noxious
poſterity.</p>

the Ephemera; which, though not ſtrictly belonging to it, yet ſeems more
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly referred to this rank than any other. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we muſt not attend
to the rigour of method, in an hiſtory where Nature ſeems to take delight
to ſport in variety.</p>
                  <p>That there ſhould be a tribe of flies whoſe duration
extends but to a day, ſeems at firſt ſurprizing; but the wonder will
encreaſe, when we are told, that ſome of this kind ſeem to be born and to
die in the ſpace of a ſingle hour. The reptile, however, from which they
are bred, is by no means ſo ſhort lived; but is ſometimes ſeen to live
two years, and many times three years together.</p>
                  <p>All ephemeras, of which there are various kinds, are produced
from the egg, in the form of worms; from whence they change into a more perfect
form; namely, that of Aurelias, which is a kind of middle ſtate between a
worm and a fly: and from thence they take their laſt mutation, which is into
a beautiful fly, of <pb n="362" facs="tcp:0824000107:371"/> longer or ſhorter duration,
according to its kind.</p>
                  <p>The ephemera, in its fly ſtate, is a very beautiful winged
inſect, and has a ſtrong ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude to the butterfly, both from its
ſhape and its wings. It is about the ſize of a middling butterfly; but its
wings differ, in not being covered with the painted duſt with which thoſe
of butterflies are adorned, and rendered opake, for they are very tranſparent
and very thin. Theſe inſects have four wings, the uppermoſt of which are
much the largeſt: when the inſect is at reſt, it generally lays its wings
one over the other, on the back. The body is long, being formed of ſix rings,
that are larger at the origin than near the extremity; and from this a tail
proceeds, that is longer than all the reſt of the fly, and conſiſts
ſometimes of three threads of an equal length, or ſometimes of two long and
one ſhort. To acquire this beautiful form, the inſect has been obliged to
undergo ſeveral tranſmutations: but its glory is very ſhort lived, for
the hour of its perfection is the hour of its death; and it ſeems ſcarcely
intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to pleaſure, when it is obliged to part with life.</p>
                  <p>The reptile that is to become a fly, and that is granted ſo
long a term, when compared to its <pb n="363" facs="tcp:0824000107:372"/> latter duration, is an
inhabitant of the water, and bears a very ſtrong reſemblance to fiſhes,
in many particulars; having gills by which it breathes at the bottom, and
alſo the tapering form of aquatic animals. Theſe inſects have ſix
ſcaly legs, fixed on their corſelet. Their head is triangular: the eyes are
placed forward, and may be diſtinguiſhed by their largeneſs and colour.
The mouth is furniſhed with teeth; and the body conſiſts of ſix rings;
that next the corſelet being largeſt, but growing leſs and leſs to the
end: the laſt ring is the ſhorteſt, from which the three threads proceed,
which are as long as the whole body. Thus we ſee that the reptile bears a
very ſtrong reſemblance to the fly; and only requires wings, to be very
near its perfection.</p>
                  <p>As there are ſeveral kinds of this animal, their aurelias
are conſequently of different colours; ſome yellow, ſome brown, and
ſome cream-coloured. Some of theſe alſo bore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cells at the
bottom of the water, from which they never ſtir out, but feed upon the mud
compoſing the walls of their habitation, in contented captivity; others, on
the contrary, range about, go from the bottom to the ſurface, ſwim between
two waters, quit that element entirely to feed upon plants by the river ſide,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0824000107:373"/> and then return to their favourite element, for ſafety
and protection.</p>
                  <p>The reptile, however, though it lives two or three years,
offers but little, in its long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to excite curioſity: it is hid at
the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the water, and feeds almoſt wholly within its narrow
habitation. The moſt ſtriking facts command our attention during the
ſhort interval of its fly ſtate; into which it crouds the moſt various
tranſactions of its little life. It then may be ſaid to be in a hurry to
live, as it has but ſo ſmall a time to exiſt. The peculiar ſign whereby
to know that theſe reptiles will change into flies in a ſhort time,
conſiſts in a protuberance of the wings on the back. About that time the
ſmooth and depreſſed form of the upper part of the body, is changed into
a more ſwolen and rounder ſhape; ſo that the wings are in ſome degree
viſible through the external ſheath that covers them. As they are not
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of England, he who would ſee them in their greateſt abundance,
muſt walk, about ſun-ſet, along the banks of the Rhine, or the Seine,
near Paris; where, for about three days, in the midſt of the ſummer, he
will be aſtoniſhed at their numbers and aſſiduity. The thickeſt
deſcent of the flakes of ſnow in winter ſeem not to equal their number;
the whole air ſeems alive <pb n="365" facs="tcp:0824000107:374"/> with the new-born race; and
the earth itſelf is all over covered with their remains. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relias, or
reptile inſects, that are as yet beneath the ſurface of the water, wait
only for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of evening to begin their transformation. The moſt
induſtrious ſhake off their old gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about eight o'clock; and thoſe
who are the moſt tardy, are transformed before nine.</p>
                  <p>We have already ſeen that the operation of change in other
inſects is laborious and painful; but with theſe nothing ſeems ſhorter,
or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with greater eaſe. The aurelias are ſcarce lifted above the
ſurface of the water, than their old ſheathing ſkin burſts; and through
the cavity which is thus formed, a fly iſſues, whoſe wings, at the ſame
inſtant, are unfolded, and at the ſame time lift it into the air. Millions
and millions of aurelias, riſe in this manner to the ſurface; and at once
become flies, and fill every quarter with their flutterings. But all theſe
ſports are ſhortly to have an end; for as the little ſtrangers live but
an hour or two, the whole ſwarm ſoon falls to the ground, and covers the
earth, like a deep ſnow, for ſeveral hundred yards, on every ſide of the
river. Their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are then incredible, and every object they touch becomes
fatal to them; for they inſtantly die, if they hit againſt even each
other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:0824000107:375"/>At this time the males and females are
very differently employed. The males, quite inactive and apparently without
deſires, ſeem only born to die: no way like the males of other inſects;
they neither follow the oppoſite ſex, nor bear any enmity to each other:
after fluttering for an hour or two, they drop upon land, without ſeeming to
receive wings for ſcarce any other purpoſe but to ſatisfy an idle
curioſity. It is otherwiſe with the females; that are ſcarce riſen from
the ſurface of the water, and have dried their wings, but they haſten to
drop their eggs back again. If they happen alſo to flutter upon land, they
depoſit their burthen in the place where they drop. But then it may be
demanded, where and in what manner are theſe eggs fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, as no
copulation whatever appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſexes, in their tranſitory
viſits in air? Swammerdam is of opinion, that they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated in the
manner of fiſh-ſpawn, by the male, after being ejected by the female: but,
beſide that this doctrine is exploded even from the hiſtory of fiſhes, it
is certain, that the males have not time for this operation, as the eggs drop
to the bottom the inſtant they are laid on the water. Reaumur is of opinion
that they copulate; but that the act bears a proportion in ſhortneſs to the
ſmall duration of their lives; <pb n="367" facs="tcp:0824000107:376"/> and, conſequently,
muſt be ſo ſoon performed, as to be ſcarcely viſible. This, however,
is at beſt forcing a theory; and, it is probable, that as there are many
inſects known to breed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any impregnation from the male, as we have
already ſeen in muſcles and the oyſters, and ſhall hereafter ſee in
the gnat, and a ſpecies of the beetle, ſo the ephemera may be of this
number. Be this as it may, the females are in ſuch haſte to depoſite
their eggs, that multitudes of them fall to the ground; but the greateſt part
are laid in the water. As they flutter upon the ſurface, two cluſters are
ſeen iſſuing from the extremity of their body, each containing about
three hundred and fifty eggs, which make ſeven hundred in all. Thus, of all
inſects, this appears to be the moſt prolific; and it would ſeem that
there was a neceſſity for ſuch a ſupply, as, in its reptile ſtate, it
is the favourite food of every kind of freſh-water fiſh. It is in vain that
theſe little animals form galleries at the bottom of the river, from whence
they ſeldom remove; many kinds of fiſh break in upon their retreats, and
thin their numbers. For this reaſon fiſhermen are careful to provide
themſelves with theſe inſects, as the moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bait; and thus
turn the fiſh's rapacity to its own deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:0824000107:377"/>But though the uſual date of thoſe
flies is two or three hours at fartheſt, there are ſome kinds that live
ſeveral days; and one kind in particular, after quitting the water, has
another caſe or ſkin to get rid of. Theſe are often ſeen in the fields
and woods, diſtant from the water; but they are more frequently found in its
vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. They are often found ſticking upon walls and trees; and frequently
with the head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, without changing place, or having any ſenſible
motion. They are then waiting for the moment when they ſhall be diveſted of
their laſt incommodious garment, which ſometimes does not happen for two or
three days together.</p>
