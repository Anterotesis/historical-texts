            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A Deſire of collecting into one view, the obſervations and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of former writers, on the Hiſtory and Antiquities of Northumberland, firſt induced me to make this compilation; for ſuch with the utmoſt deference, I muſt call it.</p>
            <p>The utility of a work of this kind, to the generality of readers, is obvious; as a competent knowledge of the county may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, without the labour and expence of turning over many volumes, from whence my authorities were deduced.</p>
            <p>I have added deſcriptions of remarkable objects, in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, with drawings of ſome of the principal ones; and have endeavoured to preſerve a ſtrict impartiality through the whole.</p>
            <p>There are interſperſed through the work many original pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, found among the manuſcripts of the late Antiquary, Roger Gale, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> communicated to me by a particular friend; in which the reader will find ſeveral obſervations, made by him and his learned correſpondents,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr John Horſley, Mr John Warburton, Sir John Clerk, Mr Robert Cay, Mr Maurice Johnſon, Dr Stukeley, the Rev. Mr Robert Patten, Dr Hunter, the Rev. Mr Robert Place, and others.</note> on the antiquities of this county, never before publiſhed.</p>

            <p>BEFORE I enter upon the following deſcriptive <hi>View</hi> of the county of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> it appears neceſſary to take notice of the Roman poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this territory; and to collect into a ſeparate chronological claſs, the ſtate of regal authority therein, under the Saxon heptarchy.</p>
            <p>The kingdom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> as eſtabliſhed in the reign of <hi>Aelle,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the two Britiſh provinces of <hi>Bernicia</hi> and <hi>Deira;</hi> and extended from the rivers Merſey and Humber on the ſouth, to Liddiſdale, Cheviot Hills, and the river Tweed on the north; and from eaſt to weſt, from the German Ocean to the Iriſh Channel.</p>
            <p>The etymologies given by Camden of the name of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> are from the Saxon Norƿanhumbra ric, the kingdom of Northumberland, and Norƿan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humber-lond, lands north of Humber.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>The ſcene of my attention in this work, is that part only of this extenſive territory, which retains the name <hi>Northumberland;</hi> bounded towards the eaſt by the German Ocean, towards the weſt by the county of Cumberland, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north by the river Tweed and the ſhire of Roxborough, and towards the ſouth by the county palatine of Durham.</p>
            <p>This diſtrict, at the time the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt entered it, was inhabited by the <hi>Otadini</hi> towards the eaſt, and the <hi>Gadeni</hi> on the weſtern and maintainous parts. It is preſumed theſe invaders had not advanced ſo far northward as Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, before the third year of <hi>Agricola</hi>'s command in Britain. According to Tacitus's account, he came over in the character of Legate, in the year 78, when the ſummer was far advanced; that this dignity was conferred upon him immediately after his Conſulſhip, which by the <hi>Faſti Conſulares</hi> appears to have been in the year 77: ſo that the reduction of Northumberland by the Roman ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, happened in the year 80. The Romans did not totally deſert this iſland
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0085300201:5"/>
till the middle of the fifth century, and they poſſeſſed ſeveral ſtations is Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland to the laſt; conſequently their continuance there was for a ſeries of near 370 years.<note n="*" place="bottom">Horſley Brit. Rom. lib. I. cha. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agricola,</hi> it is well known, in his receſſion from the buſineſs of warfare, ſtudied to introduce the Roman habit and luxury among the Britons: as a good Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, conceiving that whilſt theſe pleaſures faſcinated, they alſo enervated and relaxed, rendering the natives leſs ferocious, and eaſier to be conciliated or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; and would alſo promote the future wealth of a <hi>province,</hi> of which he had the honour to compleat the conqueſt, by urging the inhabitants to extend their trade: pleaſures and luxuries introduce artificial wants, which arts, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, commerce, and navigation muſt ſupply.</p>
            <p>Theſe new enjoyments were of a ſhort exiſtence, for in the courſe of the fourth century after <hi>Agricola</hi>'s command, the natives were left expoſed to the ravages of barbarous nations, no longer kept in awe by the Roman arms.</p>
            <p>The unhappy eſtate of the northern inhabitants, after they were totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the Romans, is eaſily conceived; the perils and miſeries to which they were frequently expoſed, by the incurſions of tribes of Picts and Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally induces a belief, that the principal part of thoſe who were poſſeſſed of riches, merchandiſe, flocks, and herds, would immediately retire, and ſeek for ſafer and more peaceful habitations, in the ſouthern parts of the land. The ravagers ſtill advanced, and the wretchedneſs of the Britons was ſo greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, that they were driven to ſeek refuge in the mountains, and conceal themſelves in their foreſts and caverns. Such was the deplorable ſituation of the natives in the year 449, when they implored the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> a brave and warlike people inured to arms.</p>
            <p>Our Hiſtorians, with a diſgraceful partiality, have ſtigmatized the <hi>Saxons</hi> with the epithets of cruelty and injuſtice, in order to extenuate the errors of the Britons, or to palliate their deſpicable impotence.</p>
            <p>It manifeſtly appears, that under the protection of the Romans, the Britons had ſunk into ſupineneſs and depravity; public virtues were extinguiſhed, and an abjectneſs of ſpirit univerſally prevailed. They ſent Embaſſadors to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> thus commiſſioned:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Moſt noble <hi>Saxons.</hi> We the wretched and diſtreſſed <hi>Britons,</hi> worn our by the conſtant incurſions of our cruel and mercileſs enemies, and becauſe we have heard of the fame of thoſe glorious victories which by your valour you have obtained; therefore have we ſent our humble ſuppliants to you, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0085300201:6"/>
your kind aſſiſtance. We have large and plentiful poſſeſſions, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with every neceſſary; theſe with ourſelves, we ſubmit to your diſpoſal, if you will generouſly lend us your ſuccour againſt our inveterate foes. Long have we enjoyed the ſweets of peace, under the powerful protection of the Roman arms, and now we know none ſecond in glory to them, but your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: therefore to you we lift up our hands for aſſiſtance, and in return are willing to abide whatever ſervice you ſhall impoſe upon us.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>Some authors ſay the Saxons were not invited over by the Britons, but being exiled from their own country, landed here. But Mannius, in particular, does not ſhew any proof for this aſſertion, from the ſituation of the German ſtates in that aera.</p>
                  <p>Verſtigan, from the authority of Pomarius, ſays 9000 Saxons came over. Hector Boethius ſays they were 10,000 in number, and were tranſported in 30 ſhips.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Why ſhould we diſcredit this Hiſtorian, when the former petitions made to the Roman ſtate were equally as abject. <q>To <hi>Aetius</hi> thrice Conſul. The groans of the <hi>Britains.</hi> The <hi>Barbarians</hi> drive us to the ſea, the ſea forces us back again upon the Barbarians; in theſe dreadful extremities, death awaits us equally on both ſides, either we muſt fall by the hands of our enemies, or elſe be drowned in the ſwelling waves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Iſle of <hi>Thanet</hi> was allotted to theſe new allies, and it was not long before they rendered ſignal ſervices to the Britons. The northern ravagers, with a mighty band, were advanced into Lincolnſhire; the <hi>Saxons</hi> with alacrity took the field; Hiſtorians agree, the victory obtained over the invaders near <hi>Stamford,</hi> was only to be attributed to the military proweſs and ſkilful diſpoſitions of the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A people recovering from a ſtate of deſpair, are apt to advance to exceſs in their love and gratitude towards their redeemers. After the ravagers were thus diſcomfited, and had retired into the north, the <hi>Saxons</hi> were looked upon with the higheſt veneration: and in order effectually to repreſs the northern nations, an additional band of <hi>Saxons</hi> were petitioned for, and a greater extent of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory granted for their reſidence<note n="†" place="bottom">The Scotch writers ſay this reinforcement conſiſted of 5000 men.</note> So happy were the Britons in their new alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that <hi>Vortergern</hi> their Prince eſpouſed <hi>Rowena,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Hengiſt</hi> the Saxon General.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances evidently prove, the <hi>Saxons</hi> were invited hither to partake the land and become ſettlers, as it doth not appear from any admiſſible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that any other gratuity <note n="‡" place="bottom">

ſo that providing them ſettlements, was giving even what the fugitive Britons could not hold. The county of <hi>Kent</hi> was the ſecond eſtabliſhment granted to theſe allies.</p>
            <p>So peculiarly frail and inſtable by nature, were the diſpoſitions of mind poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the natives, that no ſooner were they relieved from the moſt abject ſtate, and deplorable calamities and diſtreſſes, than, in the moment of eaſe, they began to regard thoſe who had reſcued them with jealouſy, to be diſcontented with their former reſolutions, to imagine future evils, and to deviſe projects of the groſſeſt ingratitude. The heroic <hi>Saxons</hi> received the intelligence with contempt, and looked upon the ingratitude with abhorrence. The moſt abject mind the ſooneſt conceives ingratitude: there is a baſeneſs and illiberality in grovelling ſouls, which deteſts a ſenſe of obligations; the meaneſt peaſant hath the moſt ungenerous ſentiments; diſtruſt and jealouſy are the iſſue of vicious hearts; ſelfiſhneſs is brutal, and characteriſtic of ignorance. On the other hand, hero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>c minds are fired with virtues, for courage and fortitude are the reſult of principle. The angry <hi>Saxons</hi> no ſooner beheld the inſtability of Britiſh faith and affection, than they began to deviſe the means of taking the reigns of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment out of the hands of impotence. The name of <hi>King</hi> was yet unknown among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who in emergencies of ſtate choſe an Heretogen, or <hi>General,</hi> who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e power and dignity ſubſided with the occaſion of his election. They knew no obligation to Sovereigns, their liberty was uncontaminated with the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages of ſupremacy. The royal dignity of <hi>Vortergein</hi> was by them eſteemed of little importance, and of much leſs utility.</p>
            <p>The abjectneſs of the Britons was deſpicable, and the <hi>Saxons</hi> contemplated it with contempt. The land before their arrival was ravaged by barbarous tribes, even the ſouthern provinces were deſolated, and the natives driven to the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and mountains: they were no longer able to retain, or worthy to rule ſo fertile a country. Such were the cauſes which induced the <hi>Saxons</hi> to deviſe means of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

PRINCIPLES OF OUR INESTIMABLE CONSTITUTION. If we inherit any thing from the Britons, it conſiſts of their <hi>ferocity, inſtability,</hi> and <hi>ingratitude.</hi> Without the Saxon arms, this iſland, like the regions of the eaſt, would have been over-run and deſolated by a banditti, worſe than Tartars; and become a den of thieves, pirates, and robbers.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh Prince ſtill lived in a ſtate of confidence and eſteem with his new ally; every one but <hi>Vortergern</hi> could diſcern the countenance of amity which <hi>Hengiſt</hi> now aſſumed, was a ſuperficial maſk which covered his reſentment, through which inſincerity was eaſily diſcovered; and that protection was at length become his moſt diſtant object. The Britons conceived, that from the time of <hi>Rowena</hi>'s eſpouſal, the <hi>Saxons</hi> put on an inſolent and contemptuous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which increaſed their natural jealouſy againſt them.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the <hi>Saxons</hi> obſerved the government was involved in anarchy and confuſion, the Britiſh ſtates were diſtracted by factions and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, and each individual overwhelmed in deſpondency, and relaxed from all warlike diſpoſition. <hi>Hengiſt</hi> foreſaw, that if he ſhould withdraw his troops, this fine fertile land muſt become a deſert, under the ravages of thoſe barbarians, who were irreſiſtible by Britiſh force: the depopulation of the northern territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, favoured an intention he had formed, as he conceived the poſſeſſion of <hi>Northumberland</hi> would facilitate his ſubjugation of the Britons. In order to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this purpoſe, as he poſſeſſed the ear of the Prince, he expatiated on the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages conſtantly made by the northern nations, who, though lately repreſſed, were again advancing to the interior parts of the country; he propoſed, that a reinforcement of his countrymen ſhould be invited to ſettle in thoſe deſolated diſtricts, at once to ſubdue the ferocious bands of robbers, and form a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard for the ſouthern provinces. The plauſibility of the project, the imbecility of <hi>Vortergern</hi>'s political judgment, the abjectneſs of ſpirit which poſſeſſed the Britiſh councils, and the wretchedneſs of the people, groaning under diſtreſs and the miſeries conſequent to war, together with the implicit confidence with which the Prince liſtened to the admonitions of his confident, promiſing a ſafe and indolent reign under ſuch protection, all concurred to promote the plan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octa,</hi> the brother of <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> and <hi>Ebuſſa</hi> his ſon, after receiving the ſummons, with the utmoſt alacrity prepared to collect their adherents, and ſoon paſſed over from Germany with a choſen band of warlike <hi>Saxons,</hi> taking poſſeſſion of <hi>Northumberland</hi> in the year of our Lord 454.</p>
            <p>The new colony had not ſettled long in this diſtrict, before <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> no longer able to endure the indignities put upon him and his people, and the infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments repeatedly made on the lands granted them on their arrival in Britain, brought his troops into the field, and began hoſtilities.</p>
            <p>Be very in the people is ſeldom obſerved under an impotent commander;— courage is intimately connected with confidence, and where the leader doth not
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0085300201:9"/>
poſſeſs the good opinion of his troops, they act with timidity and reluctance. It was the caſe with the Britons, when <hi>Hengiſt</hi> ſhewed his hoſtile intentions, and threw off diſguiſe; the ſubjects of <hi>Vortergern</hi> regarded him with ſhame, their councils were full of confuſion, and they were ſeized with a panic almoſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon deſpair: the reſiſtance they made was weak and fruitleſs, and at length they fled before the Saxon veterans, to their former places of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the wilderneſſes and mountains.</p>
            <p>The northern band, regarding <hi>Hengiſſ's</hi> proceedings as a ſignal for them to take the field, immediately roſe in arms.</p>
            <p>I ſhould advance into too large a field, ſhould I follow the Saxon arms through all the conflicts: I am confined to their northern colony, and reſtrained within the limits of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> muſt forſake a general, for a partial view of their actions.</p>
            <p>Some modern authors have accuſed the <hi>Northumbrian Saxons</hi> of a confederacy with the Picts and Scots; a charge I do not find ſupported by any valuable authority. The ſtruggles during the courſe of fifty years and upwards, were many, and various the events; the Britons remained unſubdued, and the Saxons unexpelled. At length, in the year 547, <hi>Ida,</hi> with twelve ſons and a large reinforcement, landed at Flamborough,<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron.

            <p>His important conqueſts made him ſo much the terror of the adjoining ſtates, that he remained for ſome time undiſturbed.

This was a proper occaſion for <hi>Paulinus,</hi> who was one of the Queen's miniſters, to exhort the King to renounce the errors of his religion: the pious example and love of <hi>Ethelburga</hi> contributed to move his mind, and render him more ſuſceptible of the arguments which were uſed for his converſion; at length, with the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a vow, he declared, <q>That if the Deity which the Chriſtians ſerved, and whom they called the God of Juſtice, would enable him to puniſh this violator of the laws of nature, nations, and kings, who had ſent forth unprovoked the murderer againſt him, he would from thenceforth confeſs his divinity, and worſhip none other Gods but him.</q> As a pledge of his vow, he delivered into the hands of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> his infant daughter <hi>Eanfled,</hi> who was brought into the world the evening of the day on which the horrid attempt was made againſt his life, to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.<note n="†" place="bottom">Bede, lib.

               <hi>Edwine</hi> was ſlain in the month of October, A. D. 633, in the 48th year of his age, having reigned ſixteen years.

            <p>The blood of <hi>Oſwin</hi> continually hung upon his conſcience, to expiate which, he vowed to make a pilgrimage to Rome; but falling ſick, Death fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated his project.

            <p>Hiſtorians are ſilent as to the fate of <hi>Ethelwald;</hi> it is probable that he was depoſed by <hi>Oſweo</hi> after the battle of <hi>Loidis,</hi> and <hi>Deira</hi> again united with <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia:</hi> for ſuch union appears upon the opening of the ſucceeding reign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oſweo</hi> had by <hi>Eanfled</hi> his Queen, two ſons and one daughter: <hi>Egfrid</hi> his eldeſt ſon ſucceeded to his crown; <hi>Elſwin</hi> the youngeſt only lived to the age of 18, being ſlain in battle; <hi>Elfleda</hi> his daughter, in conſequence of her father's vow before the battle with <hi>Penda,</hi> took on her the veil, and was accordingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the care of the Abbeſs <hi>Hilda,</hi> in the monaſtery of <hi>Stainſlatch,</hi> now <hi>Whitby,</hi> where ſhe ſucceeded to be Abbeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eanfled</hi> after <hi>Oſweo</hi>'s deceaſe, retired to the ſame monaſtery, where ſhe ſpent the remainder of her life, and where were interred her remains, with thoſe of <hi>Oſweo</hi> and <hi>Elfleda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oſweo</hi> had by his concubines two children, <hi>Alcfrid</hi> who ſucceeded his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Egfrid</hi> on the throne, and <hi>Alkfleda</hi> who was married to <hi>Peada, Penda</hi>'s ſon.</p>
            <p>EGFRID being releaſed from his confinement in <hi>Mercia,</hi> where he was held as an hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, returned with his father's victorious army to <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and on the deceaſe of <hi>Oſweo</hi> aſcended the throne in the year 670, and in the 25th year of his age, ruling over the united provinces.</p>
            <p>From his turbulent diſpoſition, a war broke out between the Northumbrians and Mercians, which was ſo far fruitleſs, that by the interpoſition of <hi>Theodore</hi> the

            </p>
            <p>

               <hi>Egfrid</hi> died in the 40th year of his age, having reigned near 15 years: he had no iſſue. He married <hi>Etheldreda,</hi> a widow, the daughter of <hi>Anna</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt Angles,</hi> who had to her firſt huſband, <hi>Tonbert,</hi> a nobleman of great power in Huntingdonſhire and the adjoining counties. She was a moſt enthuſiaſtic zealot, and during both marriages preſerved her virginity, eſteeming ſuch reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſeverities the moſt acceptable ſervice. She lived with <hi>Egfrid</hi> 12 years, and then took the veil in the abbey of <hi>Coldingham,</hi> under <hi>Ebba.</hi> Afterwards ſhe removed, and founded the monaſtery of <hi>Ely,</hi> where ſhe governed as Abbeſs till her death. For her pious donations and exemplary auſterities ſhe was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized.</p>
            <p>ALCFRED, the natural ſon of <hi>Oſwes,</hi> ſucceeded to the throne in the year 686. He had ſpent his youth in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and according to the humour of thoſe times, had made religion his chief ſtudy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Picts</hi> in the preceding reign had obtained part of the northern territories of his predeceſſors; the moſt of which he regained, and maintained his kingdom from further depredations. Though no ſingular event in warfare diſtinguiſhed his reign, yet it was famous for his wiſe government and ſalutary laws.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0085300201:22"/>He reigned 19 years, and died in the year 705. He married in his youth <hi>Kenburg</hi> the daughter of <hi>Penda</hi> the Mercian, and had by her iſſue one ſon, OSRED, who ſucceeded him on the throne, though only eight years of age at the time of his father's death.</p>
            <p>The Northumbrians were at war with the <hi>Picts,</hi> and in the ſeventh year of this reign, under the conduct of <hi>Berthfrid,</hi> an able General, obtained a ſignal victory, with a mighty ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had <hi>Oſred</hi> arrived to manhood, than he ſhewed the moſt vicious diſpoſition in the gratification of his luſt: he deſpiſed all reſtraint, and every crime marked the progreſs of his brutal paſſion; the defilement of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bed, the pollution of places moſt ſacred, and the violation of women of all ranks, even of Nuns.</p>
            <p>He married <hi>Cuthburga</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Ina</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> who deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his repeated adulteries and enormous vices, obtained a divorce, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to a nunnery ſhe had founded at <hi>Winburn</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire.</hi>

            <p>OSRIC, who was the ſon of <hi>Alfrid,</hi> on the demiſe of <hi>Cenred,</hi> ſeized the ſcepter in the year 718; but whether he ſat undiſturbed on the throne which he had aſcended by ſo heinous a crime, together with the events of nine years reign, remain unnoticed by Hiſtorians.

               </note> He was a pious man, and ſpent his days in devout exerciſes: letting the reins of government relax, a religious enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm poſſeſſed his people, and that abſtracted indolence took place, in which neither arts or ſciences, cultivation or manufactories advanced. The common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth will always ſuffer under an overheated zeal and enthuſiaſtic religion. The firſt acceptable ſervice of man, is rectitude of manners; that he do his duty to himſelf, his family, his neighbour, and the ſtate: a wretch who neglects all theſe, to be inceſſantly on his knees, lifting up the hands of idleneſs to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, purchaſes a heavy condemnation. The King was for ever at his devotions, his Nobles catched the infatuation, and conceiving that ſelf-denial, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and neglect of worldly concerns beſt pleaſed the Omnipotent, they founded religious houſes, raiſed churches, and took on them the monaſtic orders. Thoſe who ſhould have appeared in the ſeveral departments of government, were ſunk into cells, and the ſtate loſt its neceſſary ſupports: the influenza extended to the loweſt claſſes of men, and thoſe who ſhould have been found fit for arms and manuel employs, were lifting up long viſages and languid looks to heaven, as if the <hi>benevolent Being</hi> could only be pleaſed with ugly faces, diſtortions, and miſery. <hi>Ethelbald</hi> the King of <hi>Mercia</hi> obſerving the unhappy condition of the neighbouring empire, determined to make his advantage of it, and with a powerful army entered <hi>Northumberland.</hi> He ravaged the borders, ſacked and laid waſte their cities, and loaden with ſpoils, returned in triumph: whilſt the Northumbrians, as idle ſpectators, received their afflictions as the diſcipline and ſcourge of heaven, eſteeming them ſalutary mortifications, wherein they ſhould find ſalvation. Anarchy and confuſion took place, and the ſtate was haſtening into diſſolution, when the King, in a phrenſy of zeal, after having reigned eight years, abdicated the throne, and offered his crown at the high altar in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral church of <hi>Lindisfarn,</hi> where he aſſumed the <hi>Cowl.</hi>

            <p>Not having any iſſue, he is ſaid to have bequeathed his ſcepter to his couſin-german, <hi>Egbert</hi> the ſon of <hi>Eata,</hi> who ſucceeded him. The entering into a ſpiritual character may at that time have been eſteemed an extinction of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral rights, but by what right a <hi>Saxon King</hi> could diſpoſe of his kingdom to another, I confeſs myſelf ignorant.</p>
            <p>EGBERT aſcended the throne when the realm was in the moſt relaxed and impotent ſtate; all the adjoining powers were committing continual depredations on his ſubjects, who, like men of diſturbed reaſon, bowed their ſimple heads to every affliction,
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0085300201:24"/>
and put their hands in their boſoms void of ſelf-defence: even the tributary ſtates began to declare for freedom and independence; and to perfect the miſery of the realm, the Mercians were renewing the war.</p>
            <p>How difficult a taſk it was to rouſe the lethargic zealots from their faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to take up arms, may eaſily be conceived: at length <hi>Egbert</hi> diſciplined and led forth a powerful army, and with great military proweſs, brought the the malecontents to their duty, ſubdued the Picts and Britons who were in arms, and beat back the Mercians.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was he relieved from theſe troubles, and peace ſmiled upon his reign, than catching the infatuation of the age, after reigning 21 years, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his ſovereignty, and aſſumed the character of a Monk.<note n="*" place="bottom">Malmſ. lib.

            <p>ETHELRED the ſon of <hi>Ethelwald,</hi> was choſen to ſucceed him; but his reign began with factions, either from the intereſts of thoſe of royal deſcent, or from the moroſe diſpoſition which <hi>Ethelred</hi> diſplayed in his firſt maxims of government; perhaps both thoſe cauſes operated to ſtir up the ſucceeding rebellions. His Generals were unfortunate, and his arms unſucceſsful againſt the malecontents; at a place called <hi>Kings-cliff</hi> his troops were routed by the rebels, and <hi>Alduff</hi> his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was ſlain: and in a ſecond battle, at a place called <hi>Holy-thorn,</hi> the rebels again prevailed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ethelred</hi> ſoon ſaw himſelf deſerted, and the ſtate in the utmoſt confuſion: in conſequence of which he thought it prudent to withdraw himſelf privily, and ſave his life, which he perceived was in imminent danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edelbald</hi> and <hi>Herebert,</hi> two noblemen of great influence, had headed theſe factions, and now perceiving there was no obſtacle remaining, proceeded to place <hi>Alfwold,</hi> the brother of <hi>Alured,</hi> on the throne. <note n="†" place="bottom">Malmſ. lib.

            <p>ALFWOLD thus ſupported, aſſumed the ſcepter, no one preſuming, in the turbulent eſtate of the kingdom, to oppoſe thoſe violent meaſures. <hi>Alfwold</hi> was of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition, and ſo far from preſuming to act oppreſſively, in conſequence of the power by which he was ſupported, that he tempered his government with mercy and juſtice. So unhappy was the removal of the diadem from the royal line, and its diſpoſition on the nobility, that factions ſoon were kindling in every diſtrict, and diſſatisfactions breathing from every quarter: all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles regarded themſelves as being publicly affronted, and that the election of <hi>Alfwold</hi> was to be conſidered as their diſparagement. The excellencies and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the King were totally diſregarded; they rather aggravated than ſerved to conciliate: at length the people roſe up in open rebellion, and a conſpiracy was formed againſt his life. <hi>Alfwold</hi> had reigned about ten years, when he was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly ſlain by <hi>Sigga,</hi> a chief of the conſpirators, and one whom he retained about his perſon.

The ſons of <hi>Alfwold</hi> having gained the aſylum of <hi>York,</hi> were regarded with an eye of jealouſy, leſt in ſome future day they ſhould lay claim to their father's diadem: by an artful addreſs, and promiſes of great employments in the ſtate, he ſeduced them from their place of ſecurity, and ſoon after had them aſſaſſinated near <hi>Wan-waldermere.</hi> His hands were ſtained with blood, and his heart was hardened with crimes: he had policy enough to enſnare the unfortunate <hi>Oſred,</hi> who fell a ſacrifice to his wiles, and was put to death at a place called <hi>Cunburge.</hi> Truſting that every object was removed which could diſturb his government, he thought it would ſtrengthen his authority to make an alliance with <hi>Offa</hi> King of <hi>Mercia:</hi> to this end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any real cauſe of offence, he divorced his Queen, and married <hi>Elfled, Offa</hi>'s daughter. His tyranny and vices were odious, and all his ſubjects groaned under their oppreſſions. At length the enormity of his crimes rouſed the people, who no longer could ſupport their afflictions; cabals and inſurrections were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in every quarter of the kingdom, which at length broke out into a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rebellion; and in the tumult <hi>Ethelred</hi> was ſlain on the 18th of April, 795, at <hi>Corbre,</hi> having reigned near four years after his reſtoration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:0085300201:27"/>From this period the <hi>kingdom</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was rent by innumerable fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and an univerſal anarchy prevailed. Kings were placed upon the throne by parties, as they gained the ſuperiority, and were depoſed as other parties roſe. Among thoſe Monarchs, <hi>Oſwald</hi> and <hi>Eardulf</hi> are named by Hiſtorians, who poſſeſſed a ſhort and turbulent reign. In this diſtraction the kingdom was involved, when <hi>Egbert</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> in the year 826, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the <hi>Mercians,</hi> entered <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and ſoon reduced it to ſubjection.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>EGBERT</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> having conquered <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> became Sovereign of the united States of the <hi>Heptarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The modes of government being ſettled, and each province recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to his authority, he diſbanded his army, and during ſeven years peace, promoted the cultivation of thoſe arts and ſciences, which ſhould increaſe the general happineſs and wealth of his people.</p>
            <p>In the thirty-ſecond year of this reign, the <hi>Danes</hi> made their firſt deſcent upon this iſland. To trace all the ravages thoſe Barbarians
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0085300201:31"/>
committed, would lead to deſcriptions tedious and painful: many parts of <hi>Northumberland</hi> retain memorials of their hoſtilities; and ſuch in the courſe of this work will neceſſarily be attended to.</p>
            <p>It appears, that under <hi>Alfred,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> held the ſole poſſeſſion of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> but whether as tributaries or conquerors, is not clearly aſcertained: <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>Athelſtan</hi> obtained many ſignal victories over them, and at length effected their expulſion from this territory.</p>
            <p>From this period we find the government of Northumberland repoſed in nominees of the Crown, who aſſumed the titles of Earls of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland; many of whom are named by our Hiſtorians, and their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar actions, ſo far as they are relative to the immediate objects of my attention in this work, are recounted.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <q>Amongſt whom theſe are reckoned up in order in our hiſtories:—Oſulfe, Oſlake, Edulph, Waldeof the Elder, Uchtred, Adulph, Alred, Siward, Toſtie, Edwin, Morcar, Oſculph, and that right valiant Siward, as he lived in arms, ſo would he die armed.—Then this earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and theſe parts were given unto Toſtie, the brother of Earl Harold: but the earldoms of Northampton and Huntingdon, with other lands of his, were aſſigned to the noble Earl Waldeof his ſon and heir. I will add what I have read in an old manuſcript, in the library of John Stowe, an Antiquary of the city of London:—Copſo being made Earl of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland by William the Conqueror, expelled Oſculph, who ſoon after flew him: Oſculph did not long ſurvive this revenge, he being killed by a javelin, from the hands of a robber After this Goſpatrick purchaſed this earldom of the Conqueror, but was ſoon after depoſed. Waldeof the ſon of Siward ſucceeded him, and he in a ſhort time loſt his head. Then Walcher Biſhop of Durham had the earldom, and was ſlain at a riotous aſſembly of the people. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Mowbray attained theſe honours, which he forfeited by treaſonable attempts to depoſe King William Rufus, in favour of Stephen Earl of Albemarle. King Stephen gave this earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to Henry, ſon of David the Scotch King; and William his ſon, afterwards King of Scotland, aſſumed the title, claiming it from his mother of the family of Earls Warren, as appears by the book of Brinkburn Abbey. After ſome time elapſed, Richard the Firſt ſold this earldom to Hugh Pudſey Biſhop of Durham for life, ceriding him in his title, as having tranſmigrated an old Biſhop into a young Earl. But when the King was a priſoner to the Emperor, in his return from the Holy Land, Hugh having contributed for his ranſom only 2000 pounds of ſilver, which the King reſenting, eſteeming it but a trifling ſum for one who had amaſſed immenſe riches, he diveſted him of this dignity: after which time the title of Earldom of Northumberland lay dormant about 180 years. At length it was revived in the family of Piercys.</q>

The ſtone is manifeſtly of that ſort that are uſually inſerted in the face of the walls or other works built or rebuilt by the ſoldiers: and nothing more can be inferred from this inſcription, but that a vexillation of the 20th legion had rebuilt this ſtation, or ſomewhat about it.</q>

This was a wretched place for the ſubſiſtence of a cohort; cultivation (even in this age) has only crept down the ſkirts of the valleys, and hung upon the margins of the rivers; even where her ſteps have imprinted the narrow ſhores, corn has not hitherto bleſſed the labour of the huſbandman.</p>

                           </gap>s copy diligently compared, I have given ſuch a reading to it, as appeared to me the moſt probable. Camden tells us, "that the inſcription was imperfect, and compendiouſly written, with the letters linked one in another," yet he has given it only in plain Roman capitals; but by the help of the ſtone at Appleby. I have brought it nearer to the true form. The inſcription is manifeſtly to Caracalla, and the titles given to his predeceſſors are agreeable to the Roman hiſtory. All that Camden ſays in relation to it, by way of explication, is, "that the third cohort of the Nervii built a temple here to Antoninus the Emperor, the ſon of Severus."—But in order to make ſome ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the ninth line there have been moſt probably ſome numeral letters after IMP. and more after TR. POT, and theſe may be determined by conſulting hiſtory and the inſcriptions on coins, in order to know how oft he en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

P. XVI. IMP. II. COS. IIII; ſo that the ninth line has probably been the like, as above. 'Tis true he had often, during the ſame conſulate, the tribunitial power, and was oftener ſaluted Imperator, but the vacant ſpaces ſeem not to admit any larger numbers. The P. P. at the end of the line is <hi>Patri Patriae.</hi> In the next line I apprehend there is only an X wanting before Voto, thus, AED EX VOTO, <hi>adem ex Voto,</hi> &amp;c. PR. PR. for Propraetor, ſeems alſo to be effaced in the laſt line but one. But I am apt to think there has been nothing more in the laſt line, and that no letters are wanting between the M and G (though ſo repreſented in Camden as if there were) and that we are to read <hi>Genio Romae Poſuit.</hi> So that if this temple has been erected to Caracalla, it has been dedicated to him as the Genius of Rome, or of the Roman people, a flattering compliment too often paid by the Roman people to their Emperors. Perhaps the name of the Propraetor has been deſignedly ſtruck out; but who he was cannot be known from any other inſcriptions: and as for the Roman hiſtorians, they are entirely ſilent with reſpect to any affairs in Britain at this time, and for a great while after. To remove the difficulty that may ſeem to ariſe from Caracalla's being called the grandſon of M. Aurelius Antoninus, to whom his father Severus was no ways related, nor ever adopted by him, it may not be amiſs to repeat what I obſerved before from X<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But there is another difficulty in the words of the inſcription, and that is, how Caracalla could be adnepos or atnepos both to Trajan and Nerva: for if he was ſo to the former, as the regular ſeries of the preceding Emperors requires, he muſt have been trinepos to Nerva. Perhaps therefore the word et in the ſixth line ſhould be fil. and we ought to read <hi>Divi Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jani Parthici filii divi Nervae, adnepoti.</hi> This will make the genealogy conſiſtent; and the manner of expreſſion is not improper, and in effect the ſame as <hi>Trajani adnepoti, Nervae tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nepoti.</hi>" This inſcription was erected in the year 213, when Caracalla was the fourth time Conſul. I have deſcribed and explained it next to number CXII, becauſe I think theſe two are ſomewhat of a like nature.</q>

               <p>The Scots plundered this place, in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, but being purſued by the then Lord Warden of the Middle Marches, they ſuffered ſeverely for their temerity.—Here is an infant manufactory of coarſe baize, to which the ſituation promiſes proſperity.—A ſmall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment was made by Lady Capel, for a maſter to teach reading and writing.</p>
               <p>At the eaſt end of the town is an eminence, called Caſtle Banks, of an oval figure; in the centre of which is a fine ſpring. On the eaſt and weſt end, four diſtinct terraces, bankings, or gradations are cut; ariſing one above another. The crown of the hill, is defended by a breaſtwork of earth, towards the town; and on the ſouth by an inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible precipice, at whoſe foot the river runs. To what people this fortification belonged is not known, no memorable action having made it remarkable in hiſtory. Mr Wallis's opinion appears to be a very juſt one, that theſe eminences thus terraced, were occupied by the militia when an enemy had penetrated the country; where they not only had a powerful appearance in ſuch arrangement, but alſo could fight with great advantage when an attack was made upon them.</p>
               <p>This county bears innumerable memorials of warfare, ſeveral of which are not now to be aſcribed to any particular people, either from their form, materials, or conſtruction. It was the mode of all contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

parties, in ancient times to entrench, and throw up breaſtworks, which were frequently formed to ſuit the ſituation, without regard to any ſingular model common to themſelves: This was the practice, only in times of immediate emergency; the permanent camps or ſtations, were fortified in a mode peculiar to each people: Such as are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able will be particularly noticed in the following pages.</p>

               <head>CARR-VORAN,</head>
               <p>a Roman ſtation, ſituate on a declivity, which deſcends ſwiftly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſouth-weſt, about a hundred yards diſtant from the Picts Wall, of a ſquare figure with obtuſe angles, each ſide being 120 paces. The Pretorium is very diſtinguiſhable, about ſeven paces from the ſouthern ſide, commanding a very extenſive proſpect. Mr Carrick, who farms the ground, is raiſing the foundations of the Pretorium, and will no doubt diſcover ſome valuable antiquities. I procured here a fine ſilver coin of Antoninus Pius, well preſerved, which was found on this ſtation.</p>
               <p>In Warburton's Vallum Romanum, this ſtation is numbered eleven, his treatiſe beginning at Segedunum. With Mr Horſley, he preſumes there is no doubt but this was the ancient Magna, where the <hi>Cohors Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda Dalmatarum</hi> was quartered, according to the Notitia. Whether the ancient name Magna was Britiſh or purely Roman, is difficult to determine.<note n="*" place="bottom">Horſley's Br. Ro. p. 107.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Mr Horſley's deſcription is chiefly, that Carr-Voran is placed about 12 or 13 chains to the ſouth of both the walls (which are here very near to each other) and has a peat moſs before it. This may both be the reaſon of the modern name, and why the walls approach no nearer to it. The ramparts round this fort are very conſpicuous, and the whole ditch remains diſtinguiſhable: the buildings without the fort, have been on the ſouth and weſt ſides, on the deſcent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the river Tippal. This is one of the forts entirely within Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian's Vallum. The military way called Maiden Way, paſſes through this place, and, as is ſaid, goes to Beau Caſtle, which is about ſix miles
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0085300201:44"/>
from it: and the other military way, which comes from Walwick Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, paſſes a little to the ſouth of this fort, or enters and terminates in the Roman town here. It is very viſible upon the moor ſouth-eaſt of, and not far from Carr-Voran.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0085300201:46"/>The letters in the name Conſtantino, are crowded for want of room on the ſtone. The repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the word Caeſari at the beginning and end renders it very curious, and perhaps ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in its kind. Spanheim takes notice of the like on two coins; one of Carinus, and the other of Numerinus; but repreſents them as peculiar, and contrary to the uſual cuſtom. In the letters IMR at the beginning, the R which is very plain on the ſtone, is either a miſtake for P, or elſe a deſigned contraction of IMPER. for Imperatori: ſo we have NBL for Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, and CS for Caeſar; as likewiſe CT for Caput or Civitas, as Manutius reads them; with ſeveral others of the like nature, which if attended to, may in ſome caſes remove the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of an error in the Workmen This monument muſt have been erected to Conſtantine, after the death of his father Conſtantius, who died in Britain: for the title of Imperator was not given him till then.

               <p>the moſt remarkable piece of Roman Antiquity in this country, may not be diſagreeable in this place, before we enter on the more populous parts of the county. It was built as a barrier againſt the incurſions of the northern inhabitants, who were continually harraſſing the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, by attacking them in ſundry places at one time, or by ſmall bodies of ravagers, who ſwept away the cattle and flocks of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Romans called it Vallum Barbaricum, Pretentatura, and Clauſura. Hadrian's vallum was conſtructed of earth, and bears date about the year 123 of the chriſtian aera. Severus's is ſuppoſed by many to be of maſonry, and built about the year 210;<note n="†" place="bottom">Spartian, p. 363, calls Severus's work a Stone Wall.</note> but of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials it was conſtructed, the Roman authorities are very vague and doubtful. Bede ſays, <q>Severus having been victorious at home in the civil war, which was attended with many dangers, was drawn into Britain upon an almoſt general revolt of the allies there; where after many conflicts, having recovered part of the iſland, he thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to ſever it from the barbarous ſtates; not with a wall, as ſome think, but with a rampier; for a wall is made of ſtone, but a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, whereby camps are fortified to repel the force of an enemy, is made of turfs cut out of the earth, and raiſed in the manner of a wall, ſo that there be a ditch or trench in front whereout the turfs are gotten; upon which were pitched piles of very ſtrong timber. And ſo Severus caſt a great ditch, and raiſed a moſt ſtrong rampier,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0085300201:49"/>
ſtrengthened with many turrets thereupon, from ſea to ſea.</q> Here we have a perfect deſcription of one of the Roman fortifications, which Bede by miſtake attributes to Severus—an outward ditch, a rampier of earth fortified with a ſtrong paliſado, and guarded by turrets; from whence, with miſſile weapons, the defenders could flank the vallum, and command the ditch upon an aſſault. The third and laſt vallum is by many authors ſaid to be the work of the Britons, aided by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, under the third conſulate of Aetius, about the year 444, who upon receiving a ſecond embaſſy, complaining of the hardſhips they laboured under from the frequent inroads and invaſions of the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern nations, and their inability to reſiſt them, a legion was ſent into Britain, who, with the aſſiſtance of the natives, built, (or rather rebuilt and reinſtated) the wall of ſtone, in length 68 miles, from the point of land at Boulneſs, on Solway Firth, to the mouth of the Tyne. Gildas ſays, <q>the Romans erected a wall after their uſual manner of building, not like unto the other (meaning the vallum of earth or turf) or at the common charge of the empire, but aided by the poor and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable natives; this was carried from ſea to ſea, between the cities, which were placed there as fortifications againſt the enemy.</q> Bede adds, <q>which wall, that was heretofore famous and conſpicuous, they, with public and private coſt, having with them the helping hand of the Britons, built eight feet broad and twelve feet high, in a direct line from eaſt to weſt."<note n="*" place="bottom">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alſo turrets ſtanding between theſe, from whence the ſoldiers might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the approach of an enemy at a conſiderable diſtance, wherein the Areani might have their ſtations.</q> Theſe Areani were ſpies, and men ſwift of foot, to give alarms upon approaching danger. Camden ſays, in his time there was a traditionary tale, that a brazen trumpet ran through the wall, by which an alarm might be communicated from tower to tower. This report he reconciles by an ancient ſervice attendant on the border lands OF CORNAGE, for which to this day a money payment iſſues out of many of the Northumbrian eſtates. This ſervice of Cornage was a kind of tenure in grand ſerjeantry, the nature

of which was to alarm the country by the ſound of a horn when any invaſion of the Scots was perceived. The wall then was a formidable defence, 12 feet high, guarded by caſtles and exploratory turrets.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <q>Whereas the Roman Empire, by the providence of Diocleſian, was in the moſt diſtant marches ſecurely fortified with towns, caſtles, and burghs. All the military forces were ſtationed there, ſo that the barbarous nations could not enter the country without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition at every paſs. Conſtantine aboliſhing this order of garriſon, removed his troops from the marches to cities and towns not needful of armed force: ſo that he left the marches open to the barbarians, ungarriſoned, and diſtreſſed the cities with the maintenance of troops, where there was a ſettled peace. The frontier ſtations became deſolate, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers addicted to theatrical entertainments and other pleaſures, became debauched. In a word, he it was who brought the firſt cauſe of ruin to the empire.</q>

                  </note> I examined the foundations of ſome of thoſe caſtle-ſteads with attention, where the military roads approached the wall, and they appeared to me the remains of gate-ways, over which, perhaps, there were towers for their defence. No other apertures are ſeen in the wall but at the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is ſingular, as the Romans, when they found it neceſſary to ſcour the outward frontiers, or make a ſally on a ſudden attack, had no ſally-ports, or other means to depart their own fortification than by deſcending the wall, or making an egreſs at one of theſe ſtations or military ways, which indeed ſeems ſtrangely inconſiſtent. It is very probable, that the Cheſters were defended in the ſame manner as the wall deſcribed by Bede, and perhaps the vallum was ſurmounted with a paliſado, of which the Corona Vallaris, I preſume, is a model not to be denied. The obtuſe angles of the ſtations encourage an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that they were guarded by exploratory turrets.</p>
               <p>The higheſt part of the wall now ſtanding, is near Carr-Voran, where it runs upon the brink of a cliff, to the ſummit of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences: it is there near nine feet high, the outward facing of free ſtone, not totally removed. Where the foundation was not good, or the wall had to paſs a moraſs, it is built on piles of oak: the interſtice between the two facings of the wall, is filled with broad thin ſtones, placed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, and filled with run lime. Camden ſays, the wall near Carr-Voran in his time was 15 feet high, and 9 feet thick, built on both ſides of four-ſquare aſhler ſtones; which greatly exceeds Bede's deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At ſome little diſtance from Walwick, the remains of the turf or earth fence, are to be ſeen in three diſtinct bankings, or rampiers; the principal one about the height of 9 feet, and 33 feet at the baſe: at the diſtance of 24 feet to the ſouth, is a trench 21 feet wide, from the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0085300201:51"/>
ſouthern brink of which ariſes a rampier of earth, about 10 feet at its baſe, and 6 feet in height: 16 feet diſtant from this is another rampier of equal height, and 19 feet at its baſe; theſe two laſt on the ſouth ſide of the trench, forming a perfect covered way, in breadth 16 feet. The moſt northern of theſe rampiers, in this part, is diſtant from the ſtone wall 30 paces; the preſent military road paſſing between them.</p>
               <p>The particular deſcription of theſe fortifications of the Romans, given by Mr Horſley, in his Brit Rom. and Mr Warburton, in his Vallum Rom. would be too tedious to be inſerted here, and inconſiſtent with my plan. Their more general obſervations, together with my own, muſt ſuffice.</p>
               <p>It is evident there have been three different Praetenturae erected here at different times, and by different perſons: the firſt of which was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſtations or forts, placed quite croſs the country; and this, it is preſumed, was done chiefly by Julius Agricola, and is the moſt ancient of the three. Next to this was erected Hadrian's vallum, and its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances; after which the aforeſaid ſtations might probably go by the name of <hi>Stationes</hi> per <hi>Liniam Valli.</hi> The laſt and ſtrongeſt fence of all was (as moſt learned antiquaries agree) built by Severus, which is a ſtone wall, that lays north of the rampiers of earth.</p>
               <p>Hadrian's vallum was the ſecond Praetentatura, and ſeems rather to have given the former the name of Stations per <hi>Liniam Valli,</hi> than the wall of Severus. What Bede ſays of the wall's being rebuilt afterwards by the Romans, is applicable to this: <q>that it is carried on from town to town much in a ſtrait line.</q> What belongs to this work, is the Vallum on the brink of the ditch, having the ditch on the north, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vallum ſouthward, diſtant from the former about 16 feet, and a large Vallum on the north of the ditch. The ſouth Vallum has either been made for an inner defence, in caſe the enemy might beat them from any part of the principal vallum, or to protect the ſoldiers againſt a ſudden attack from the provincial Britons. Theſe four works keep all the way a conſtant regular paralleliſm one to another. The third Praetentatura was Severus's ſtone wall. We have the expreſs teſtimony of ſome ancient writers, concerning this Emperor's building a wall croſs our iſland; which will be explained hereafter. To this work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0085300201:52"/>
a paved military way, which has attended the wall on the ſouth ſide, though it be not always parallel to it. It ſometimes coincides with Hadrian's north vallum; but whenever this is too diſtant, or perhaps has been too ruinous, or in any other reſpect inconvenient, the new mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary way (which is a reparation of the old Roman road made by order of government) always accompanies Severus's wall, and comes up near to every Caſtellum upon it; and therefore it is to be preſumed the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man military road has been a work cotemporary with the wall, and directly for its ſervice. It is apprehended there has been alſo a leſſer military way near to the wall, for the convenience of ſmall parties paſſing from turret to turret. There is alſo belonging to this work, a large ditch on the north ſide of the wall; but there are no remains, to prove that there was any breaſtwork or Agger of earth on its northern brink. Upon this wall certain caſtles and turrets have been regularly placed, and at proper diſtances one from another; and in order to form a general idea of the wall, and its original ſtate, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to have ſome knowledge of theſe.</p>
               <p>All theſe caſtles, except one near Harlow Hill, (which may have been built before the wall) are 66 feet ſquare, the wall itſelf falling in with and forming the north ſide of them. The intervals between theſe caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles are not always exactly the ſame, but excepting two or three at the eaſt end of the wall, always leſs than a mile, that is, from ſix furlongs and a half to ſeven. They are conſtantly called caſtles or caſtle-ſteads by the country people, (which ſeems to make it probable that the latin word has been caſtellum) and by the form and uſe of them, ſeem to have been a ſmaller ſort of a caſtle for a ſmall garriſon. So likewiſe they call the Caſtra Stativa, or Aeſtiva uſually Cheſters, from the Latin: and this is a uſual criterion whereby to diſcover a Roman encampment or ſtation. Theſe Caſtella ſeem to have ſtood cloſeſt, where the ſtations are wideſt, and are by ſome modern authors called mile caſtles, or mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary Caſtella. In the laſt edition of Camden, they are, through miſtake, ſaid to be of a very different ſhape and ſize. Perhaps the remaining ruins of two or three caſtle-ſteads, that do not join the walls, and of one that does, which are all plainly of another ſort, have occaſioned this error. It is not improbable, that there may alſo have been ſome exploratory caſtles belonging to Hadrian's work, though there be little appearance of ſuch at preſent, unleſs the ſmall remains at Chapel Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, near Newburn, and thoſe near Heddon on the Wall, which are Caſtle-Steads, be of this ſort. But be that as it will, (in relation to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0085300201:53"/>
Hadrian's vallum) above two-thirds of theſe caſtella are yet very viſible upon the wall of Severus, and for a long way together, eſpecially about the middle of the wall, they have their diſtinct veſtiges remaining without interruption. But the original number and ſituation of theſe caſtella may be beſt known by the following table, taken from Mr Warburton's Vall. Rom. and Mr Horſley's Brit. Rom.</p>

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0085300201:54"/>The ſmall turrets (in Latin, Turres) have been more generally and entirely ruined than the Caſtella; ſo that it is hard to find three of them any where together with certainty. The diſtance between two, where it was thought ſureſt, was meaſured, and found to be near 14 chains, or 308 yards. It therefore ſeems moſt probable, that there have been four of theſe between every two Caſtella, at equal diſtances from the Caſtella and one another; for thus five intervals will be found between every two Caſtella, each conſiſting of 14 chains; which five intervals will juſt amount to 7 furlongs, the uſual or mean diſtance between the Caſtella. And this ſcheme anſwers with a good deal of exactneſs to the ſituation of all the turrets, that have yet been diſcovered. Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploratory turrets, or watch towers, ſeem to have been only about four yards ſquare at the bottom; and by placing centinels at each of theſe, who muſt have been within call of one another, the communication quite along the wall might be kept up, without having recourſe to the fiction of a ſounding trumpet, or pipes laid under ground, from one end of the wall to the other, though this ſeems to be credited by Mr Echard and others.</p>
               <p>There have alſo been ſeveral larger forts or ſtations upon the wall, or near it, whoſe diſtances from each other will be particularly ſhewn hereafter, and may be ſeen in the foregoing table.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I am giving a general view of the ancient ſtate of the wall, it may not be improper to obſerve, that there have been 18 of theſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon it, with 17 intervals between them: the wall is in length 68 miles and three furlongs; this divided by 17, gives the mean diſtance, which is very little more than four miles: but the ſtations are much cloſer and thicker at each end, and in the middle, than in the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſpaces, between the middle and the extremities; which is not diſagreeable to reaſon, or the uſual rules of fortification. Beſides, if according to the common tradition, the inroads of the enemy were in, or near the middle, it was neceſſary to make it ſtronger, and guard it more; eſpecially ſince the advanced ſtations were feweſt, if any, where thoſe upon the wall were cloſeſt.</p>
               <p>This wall runs generally upon the top or ridge of the higher ground, keeping a deſcent on the north or enemy's ſide, and hath thereby both a greater ſtrength, and better proſpect; for the ſake of which, it often forms an angle. In Hadrian's vallum it is different, but both in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0085300201:55"/>
main ſeem to have been carried on pretty much in a ſtraight line, from ſtation to ſtation: there is indeed now and then a gentle turn in croſſing a rivulet, or at a ſtation, and ſometimes too in paſſing a height; but this laſt happens uſually at coming within ſight of a ſtation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in order to reach it. Hadrian's vallum keeps more in a ſtraight line than Severus's wall, as much as the nature of the ground and other circumſtances would admit. It is plain, a military way has conſtantly attended Severus's wall, and no doubt was made at the ſame time with it: this always keeps nigh to the wall, and never coincides with the north vallum of Hadrian, but when the two works approach one another. When they part, and go at a diſtance one from the other, the way leaves the vallum to accompany the ſtone wall; but where the wall paſſes along the brink of precipices, the way does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low every little turn, but in theſe leſſer windings, is like the ſtring of a bow, and keeps upon the ſides of the hill, in order to avoid, as much as poſſible, the ſudden aſcent or deſcent in paſſing from hill to hill, and yet ſo as at the ſame time never to be at a great diſtance from the wall. The rule therefore by which this way ſeems to have been conducted, is in general by keeping pretty cloſe to the wall, and and at the ſame time going on a line from Caſtellum to Caſtellum, and ſhunning the aſcent of hills as much as poſſible. And as the ſmaller military way went from turret to turret cloſe by the wall, ſo this greater way attended the Caſtella, falling in with Hadrian's north vallum (which Mr Warburton conceives was the old military way, though north of the ditch, vallums, and covered way) when that did not take too much out of the road, or was not too ruinous to be made uſe of. The old military way, as Mr Warburton calls it, has been the beſt and moſt direct paſſage from ſtation to ſtation, and when the line of the ſtations fetched a compaſs, another diſtinct military way, and ſhorter, was laid; not from one ſtation to the next, but between two ſtations more remote.</p>
               <p>This was certainly done in Northumberland, from Walwick to Carr-Voran; and I have reaſon to apprehend the like was done alſo in Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, from Carr-Voran, or at leaſt from Cambeck, to Stanwicks. The military way of Severus ſeems to have been well paved, but not raiſed ſo high as what Mr Warburton calls the old military way.</p>
               <p>Mr Warburton ſays, he was not able to diſcover any gates in this wall, or paſſes through it, except juſt in the ſtations, or where the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0085300201:56"/>
grand military roads have croſſed it: where the Ermin-ſtreet (not the Watling-ſtreet, as Mr Horſley calls it) paſſes the wall near Halton, there is a viſible track of a ſquare gate, and the ditch belonging to the wall manifeſtly goes about the half of it, the inner half not being now ſo viſible. This gate ſeems to be much of the ſame ſize with one of the Caſtella, 66 feet ſquare; only theſe are wholly within the wall, and the gate half within, and half without. Mr Warburton ſays, he expected to have found ſome other gates of the ſame form, or ſome paſſes through the wall in the Caſtella, but could not. The other two military ways which croſs the wall, ſeem to have paſſed at the ſtations of Carr-Voran and Stanwicks.</p>
               <p>What the ſeveral dimenſions of the walls, ditches, Vallums, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ways have originally been, may not be eaſy to determine with exactneſs; but the length of Severus's wall is certainly known, it hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been three times meaſured of late; once by Mr Gordon, a ſecond time by order of Mr Warburton, and a third by the Board of Ordnance, A. D. 1750; and as there is little difference between the three meaſures, it is a proof there is no material miſtake in either. Mr Gordon gives a ſummary account of his work in theſe words: <q>The number of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taken in my actual ſurvey from ſea to ſea, were in all 159, wherein I made Severus's wall the principal line of the ſaid ſtationary diſtances; the total amount of which was 73959 Roman paces, equal to 73 Roman miles and 959 Roman paces, equal to 68 Engliſh miles and 169 paces.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The number of ſtations (or places of obſervation) upon the ſame principal ſtationary line, in the ſurvey Mr Warburton ordered to be made, were 164; the length of the wall, 68 miles and 3 furlongs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the length of the ſtations at each end. In this account Engliſh meaſured miles and furlongs are retained, in order to make it more plain and intelligible. It is eaſy to reduce an Engliſh mile to a Roman one, by conſidering that 1000 Roman paces, that is, 5000 Roman feet, make a Roman mile; and allowing for the inequality between the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man foot and the Engliſh, an Engliſh mile is nearly equal to a Roman mile and one-thirtieth; ſo that 13 Engliſh miles will be much about 14 Roman.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, it appears to be a miſtake to ſuppoſe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian's vallum longer than Severus's wall, as Mr Gordon ſeems to have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0085300201:57"/>
done. It is certain the former has gone more in a right line than the latter, and it ſeems probable, that Severus's wall has at each end been carried further than Hadrian's: ſo that the very exact agreement, which Mr Gordon ſuppoſes between <q>the actual ſurvey of the wall, and the account given of it by the Romans themſelves,</q> is in a great meaſure imaginary. For according to Spartian, Hadrian's vallum was 80 Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man miles long; but the actual menſuration cannot ſtretch Severus's wall up to 73, and Hadrian's vallum is certainly two or three miles ſhorter, upon account of its being ſtraighter. There had juſt been 81 milliary Caſtella upon Severus's wall, and conſequently juſt 80 intervals between the caſtella. So that if the Romans, in a general way, called every interval a mile, one with another, and Hadrian's vallum was near the ſame length with Severus's, this might be looked upon as a plauſible reaſon, why the hiſtorian ſhould ſay it was 80 miles long.</p>
               <p>According to Bede, the wall was eight feet in breadth, and twelve feet in height (as probably there was a parapet or paliſado at the top, ſo this would firſt go to ruin; Bede's meaſure is moſt likely to be excluſive of theſe): the thickneſs of Severus's wall has been meaſured ſeveral times of late, and by ſeveral perſons, without any great variation; and by the meaſures taken in different parts, it ſeems not to have been every where equal. Near Harlow-hill, it meaſured ſeven feet four inches near the foundation; and at another place, where the wall is two yards high, it was at that height about ſeven feet thick; which ſhews that the uſual breadth near the foundation was a Roman pace and an half. Near Boulneſs on the Solway Firth, at a place called Kirklands, it meaſures near nine feet: and there ſeems to be an obvious reaſon why it ſhould be ſtronger here; for at full ſea, the water has certainly flowed up to it.</p>
               <p>The breadth of Hadrian's ditch, at a lime-ſtone quarry weſt of Harlow-hill, where the original breadth and depth is apparent, and may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly aſcertained, it meaſured near nine feet deep and eleven feet over; it was wider at the top than at the bottom, the ſides being ſloping. The ditch belonging to Severus's wall, was in all places both wider and deeper than that which belonged to Hadrian's vallum.</p>
               <p>The diſtances between the ſeveral parts of theſe works ſeem, ſome of them, to have all the way been conſtantly the ſame; others of them vary. Among theſe variable diſtances, is that between the two walls, which ſometimes come very near within a chain of each other, but at
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0085300201:58"/>
other times are at 50 chains diſtance. The diſtance alſo between Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus's wall, and the military way belonging to it, is, as I have ſaid, not always the ſame, though generally about two or three chains: upon ſome particular occaſions, it may run at the diſtance of five or ſix chains from it, or conſiderably more, as between the two Caſtella weſt of Shewen Sheels, where the diſtance of the military way from the wall, is at one part 15 chains or more; but the diſtance between Hadrian's Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, ditch, and north mound, are every where the ſame, and ſo are conſtantly parallel one to the other. The north mound is about 24 feet on a medium from the ditch; and of the two mounds of the Vallum, one ariſes on the very brink of the ditch, and the other is about the diſtance of 16 feet. The materials of which theſe fortifications were conſtructed, are certainly known. Hadrian's is of earth, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mixed with ſtone; but I could diſcover no appearance of timber. Severus's was of free ſtone, as is certain from what is yet viſible of it: in ſome places, where the foundation was not good, they ſeem to have made uſe of oaken piles. The inner part of this wall is filled after a remarkable manner; the filling ſtones are generally pretty large, and moſtly broad and thin. Theſe are always ſet edge-ways, and uſually not erect, but obliquely: upon theſe the running mortar or cement, has been poured, and by this contrivance (together with the great ſtrength of their cement, in moſt places) the whole has been bound as firm, as a rock. People are much at a loſs to know, from whence the Romans had the ſtones which they uſed in building the wall in ſeveral parts, and for other occaſions. In ſome places, particularly in Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, no free ſtone is to be had, but from a very great diſtance; and in other places, where ſome might have been had, the Romans ſeem not to have uſed it, but ſtone of a very different grit. This appears more particularly in the ſtation, at the end of the wall, near Couſins Houſe; where the Roman ſtone is of a very coarſe grit, ſo as to be eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from others: and both the learned authors before me, ſay, they were aſſured, that there was no ſuch ſtone, nor any quarry of ſuch a grit, in the neighbourhood. The devil's arrows at Boroughbridge, in Yorkſhire, are yet of a coarſer nature, and ſeem to be artificial ſtone.<note n="*" place="bottom">The compoſition of the devil's arrows prove them to be artificial, pieces of brick being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with the ſmall pebbles and granules of ſpar. They appear to have been formed in a mould, the tops of the columns being channelled as the flowing in of the liquidated compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be conceived to occaſion.</note> Some particular places, from whence they were furniſhed with ſtone,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0085300201:59"/>
may be gueſſed at with probability. Such, for inſtance, are the rocks between Walwick and Carraw, through part of which Hadrian's ditch was cut: and in the late edition of Camden, it is ſuppoſed, that ſtones were got at Hellbeck Scar, on the Gelt, and Leugh Cragg; the truth of which Mr Horſley proves in his remarks on the inſcriptions there.</p>
               <p>Some have wondered, how this work could be carried on, in the face of the enemy, ſuppoſing the wall to be the very boundary at the time it was built: but there appears no reaſon to entertain this opinion; for when the Romans had advanced their conqueſts in Scotland, beyond the Firth of Tay, they only fortified the other iſthmus, between Forth and Clyde, which might be 30 miles, or more, ſouth from the utmoſt extent of their conqueſt, as appears from Tacitus's account of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſo that they kept their Pretenturae, or ſeries of fortifications, croſs the country, a good way within the bounds of their conqueſt; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably when the walls were erected here, the Romans were poſſeſſed of part of the country beyond them, and of ſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> advanced ſtations there, as may be concluded from the inſcriptions yet extant; ſo that this wall might probably not be built, till Severus had driven the enemy ſo far to the north, as to render them incapable of giving any interruption to the Romans, when carrying on the work.</p>
               <p>At which end they began the ſeveral Pretenturae, may be another enquiry. The Pretentura of ſtations, was moſt probably begun from the weſt; becauſe Julius Agricola firſt conquered the weſtern parts of the northern country: and Hadrian, I believe, in erecting his vallum, began there too, as ſeems probable from the inſcriptions. Severus, it is likely, did ſo too with his wall, which is much confirmed by the ſituation of the Caſtella, that are at a regular diſtance, if we begin our reckoning from the weſt; but if we begin to reckon from the eaſt end of the wall, the firſt Caſtellum appears within leſs than three furlongs of the Station there.</p>
               <p>It is the opinion of ſome ingenious perſons, that both the walls, with all their appurtenances, and the Stations upon them, were the work of the ſame time, and the ſame perſon; and that the one is only an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Vallum or foſs to the other. But that this was not the original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Vallum, though it might be ſo uſed by Severus, appears plain from the teſtimonies of the Roman hiſtorians; nor does this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuit the circumſtances of the work itſelf, as they yet appear. The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0085300201:60"/>
coincidence of Severus's military way, with the north Vallum without the ditch; the exact paralleliſm of all the parts of Hadrian's work, and the very unequal diſtances, that are between the two walls themſelves, are convincing arguments, that the walls have been erected at different times. It is alſo the opinion of ſome, to whoſe judgment I pay a great regard, that Severus's wall was built upon the ſame foundation with Hadrian's principal Vallum. This conjecture is ſupported by plauſible reaſons; for if the north eminence or line has been an old military way, the ſuppoſition of a rampart, and ditch to the north of that way, would remove the difficulty of the ſoldiers being expoſed to the enemy, whilſt they were on their march, ſince then the way would have been defended on both ſides. Again, the ſtations too, as well as this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed military way, are generally (though not always) included be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two walls and ditches; (or between the works of Severus and Hadrian, as they are now called) the ſtone wall of Severus frequently falling in, within the north rampart of the ſtation, as the turf wall of Hadrian does with the ſouthern.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, the advantageous ground is often left on the north ſide of Hadrian's Vallum, which in one place, near Halton Cheſters, is juſt carried round the ſouth ſkirt of a tumulus, or ſmall hill, making a ſudden turn, ſeemingly, with a deſign to avoid paſſing over it. Now if this was intended to be the moſt northerly fortification, and to be a fence againſt the northern enemies, this conduct ſeems to offend againſt right reaſon, as well as againſt the rule of Vigetius, <q>that care ſhould be taken to have no neighbouring hill higher than the fortification; which being ſeized by the enemy, might be of ill conſequence.</q> And it muſt be owned, that the ſouthern proſpect of Hadrian's work, and the defence on that ſide, is generally better than on the north; whereas the northern proſpect and defence, have been principally or ſolely taken care of in the wall of Severus. Such conſiderations as theſe have in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duced ſome to believe, that what now goes by the name of Hadrian's work, was originally deſigned for a fence againſt any ſudden inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the provincial Britons, and particularly of the Brigantes; whilſt others look upon it as a Foſſa Interior, for the ſoldiers to retreat to, after they had been beaten off, by the northern enemy from their principal Vallum. Both agree in this, that Hadrian muſt have built a more nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Vallum, than thoſe which now bear his name; and that this muſt have ſtood upon the ſame track, where Severus afterwards erected his wall. This, according to their opinion, would render the whole
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0085300201:61"/>
fortification rational, and regular; whereas, without this, it muſt have been in many places very weak, and open to the inroads of the Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians. But on the other hand, plauſible conjectures and ſpeculative arguments, muſt give way to ſtronger proofs on the contrary ſide; though at this diſtance of time, we cannot ſee into the deſigns of the Romans, nor account for every particular part of their conduct in this affair. Mr Horſley conceives, that what is now called Hadrian's north Agger or Vallum, was the moſt ancient military way, leading from Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Station; and that Hadrian's work, after this, was guided and limited by it, as it keeps a conſtant paralleliſm to it. The north Agger, conſidered as a military way, is conducted according to the Roman art and rules, in every part of it. It is carried on, in the ſhorteſt line, from Station to Station; and this, without doubt, is the true reaſon why it runs ſo much upon the ſouthern ſkirts of the northern hills, the ſhorteſt line leading that way. This is particularly remarkable, in the ſmall hill near Halton Cheſters, before obſerved. The direct line of the way would have lead over the hill; but to avoid climbing it, a ſmall turn is made to carry it round the ſkirt; and it paſſes on the ſouth ſide ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the north; becauſe, this is the ſhorter and more convenient way to the Station, to which it is tending. The other parts of Hadrian's work, keep their due diſtance and paralleliſm, bending exactly in the ſame manner, as the north Agger or Vallum does, and ſo running at a few yards diſtance to the ſouth of the hill. In a word, the north Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, or as Mr Horſley terms it, the old military way, keeps juſt ſuch a courſe, and runs through ſuch grounds, as one would expect ſuch a Roman way ſhould do. And if it was determined, that Hadrian's work ſhould ſtrictly accompany this, and keep all along an exact pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleliſm to it, they muſt then by this rule, be tied down to theſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irregularities and miſconduct, which appear in this work. It may be ſaid, that they might at leaſt have made the fortification on the north ſide of the military way, if there was no other more northerly fence; but to this it is replied, that it was ſcarce practicable to carry on the work on the north ſide of the way, ſo as to be near and parallel to it; and ſuch is the ſituation of the ground, that if they had done ſo, it would have been generally weaker than it is, running along the very ſides of the hills; unleſs they had made it where Severus's wall ſtands, and where, as has been ſaid, ſome ſuppoſe Hadrian's principal Vallum to have ſtood; but that in fact Hadrian had no Vallum here, and that the whole of his work was comprehended, in what ſtill goes by his name, appears moſt probable from the following conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0085300201:62"/>Among all the hiſtorians that mention the building of ſuch a wall by Severus, there is not the leaſt hint to be met with, of his building it upon the ſame foundation with Hadrian's Vallum. The expreſſion of Spartian, "apud Vallum," looks the likeſt it of any; but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly more agreeable to this expreſſion, to ſuppoſe it to be only near the Vallum, and not directly upon it: and to build a ſtone wall upon the foundation of an earth one, does not appear very probable. If I am not greatly miſtaken, it would be more laborious and expenſive to build ſuch a wall upon the ruinous Vallum, than to erect it upon ground that was entirely clear; and there is not at preſent the leaſt evidence of ſuch a Vallum; yet it ſeems hard to ſuppoſe, that the mound of earth has been every where ſo entirely removed, as to leave no viſible remains of it, any where, along the whole tract of the wall. Again, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus's wall paſſes over large ſpaces, where the erecting of an earthen rampart ſeems almoſt impracticable: in ſome places it paſſes, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable way, along the tops of precipices, and ſometimes, down the ſteep declivities of a bare rock; and in theſe places there is no ditch. In one place too, the wall is carried through a ſmall moraſs, near Blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarn, in Cumberland. Here, it is preſumed, the foundation is formed by piles of wood; but Hadrian's work ſhuns it, and runs at ten chains diſtance from the wall of Severus. No circumſtances appear in the two works of Severus's wall and Hadrian's Vallum, that argue them to be done at the ſame time, or to have any neceſſary relation one to the other. The conſtant paralleliſm of the north Vallum, the ditch, and the two ſouthern Vallums of Hadrian's work, is a ſhrewd argument of their mutual relation: but this paralleliſm does not hold in the wall of Severus. Where they are moſt diſtant, there are no viſible branches of any military way leading from one to the other, whereby the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between them might be more eaſily preſerved. In ſome places there is a moraſs between the two walls, which muſt make a retreat from one wall to the other inconvenient, and is improper for a body of men to ſtand on. The military way that now attends Severus's wall, is agreed to have been made at the ſame time with the wall itſelf: if then Hadrian's principal Vallum was on the ſame ground, where the wall of Severus has ſtood; how comes it to paſs, that there has been no military way accompanying it? If Hadrian's work is ſuppoſed to have been deſigned for a defence againſt an attack from the ſouth, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of the ſame kind will ariſe, perhaps not eaſy to be removed; for ſometimes the advantageous ground is left on the ſouth, where it might eaſily have been otherwiſe ordered, if their deſign had been only
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0085300201:63"/>
to ſecure themſelves againſt aſſailants from the ſouth, and the courſe of their fortification had not been previouſly determined by ſome other rule. In one place the Vallum runs between higher ground on each ſide. Beſides, if it was deſigned againſt an enemy from the ſouth, the ditch is on the wrong ſide, being to the north of two ramparts: and why may we not ſuppoſe the moſt ſoutherly rampart to have been, either a ſlight fence againſt an attack from the ſouth, or an interior defence to retreat to, if the ditch ſhould be carried by an aſſault from the north? There was no occaſion to draw ſuch a line of defence, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their making an attack upon the Stations, for they are ſtronger on all ſides than this Vallum. It is to be obſerved, that at each end of the wall, Severus's work is continued beyond Hadrian's. This part then of Severus's wall at leaſt, was not erected upon Hadrian's Vallum; and yet Mr Horſley ſays he ſee no difference between the appearance of this work here, and in the other parts of it.</p>
               <p>The legionary ſoldiers were the perſons employed in building this wall, as they were generally in all conſiderable works of this nature; and that the three Legions, which were at that time in Britain, built Antoninus's wall in Scotland, is clear from a great number of inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions found in that wall, which expreſsly declare it. The 20th Legion had no concern in building the wall of Severus; it was wholly done by the other two; namely, the <hi>Legio Secunda Auguſta,</hi> and <hi>Legio Sexta Victrix;</hi> for theſe Legions only (as far as appears) erected the inſcriptions, which will be given in the courſe of this work. If therefore 20 Cohorts, the number in two Legions, built the whole wall, it will be eaſy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſhare which belonged to each Cohort: for there being 81 Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella upon the whole wall, and ſo 80 milliary intervals; juſt four of theſe intervals would fall to the ſhare of every cohort. It may not be amiſs to try, how far we can find out the ſeveral Cohorts, belonging to the reſpective Legions, and on what part of the wall each Legion and Cohort ſeems to have been employed.</p>
               <p>If we divide the wall into four equal parts, the 1ſt and 3d quarters reckoning from the eaſt, ſeem to have been built by the <hi>Legio Secunda Auguſta,</hi> and the 2d, and laſt, by the <hi>Legio Sexta Victrix;</hi> for at the eaſt end of the wall, we have expreſs mention of the <hi>Legio Secunda Auguſta,</hi> in the ſtone at Denton, which is about ſix miles from the end of it; and we have ſix, if not ſeven Cohorts of this Legion, mentioned in thoſe centurial ſtones found in this quarter, <hi>viz.</hi> I, II, III, V, VIII, IX; beſides there
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0085300201:64"/>
is a ſeeming appearance of the 6th at Wallbottle. This quarter reaches near to Halton Sheels, or to the next Caſtellum eaſt of it; which is above two miles eaſt of Halton Cheſters. In the ſecond quarter, which reaches from hence, to the ſecond Caſtellum weſt of the Houſe-ſteeds, we have the <hi>Legio Sexta Victrix,</hi> on a centurial ſtone, about four or five miles from the beginning of this quarter; and at Houſe-ſteeds and Little Cheſters, juſt at the end of it, the ſame legion is mentioned upon two altars and two bricks: but the <hi>Legio Secunda Auguſta</hi> does not occur in this ſpace, at leaſt not on any ſtone that can be relied on. There are no Cohorts upon any ſtones in this place, diſtinct and viſible, except the 6th and 10th; but no doubt ſeveral others have been mentioned upon the many ſtones found here, though the numbers are now quite effaced. In the third quarter, which reaches to Old Wall, near Watch Croſs, in the county of Cumberland, we have <hi>Legio Secunda Auguſta</hi> mentioned again ſeveral times. Indeed the <hi>Legio Sexta Victrix</hi> occurs upon a ſtone in Cambeck fort, but probably it has been inſerted in the face of that fort, when it was repaired upon ſome other occaſion. The Cohorts of this ſpace, are the 1ſt, 6th, 7th, and 9th, which I believe have all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the <hi>Legio Secunda Auguſta.</hi> In the laſt quarter, which I believe was built by the <hi>Legio Sexta Victrix,</hi> I meet with no centurial ſtones, except one at Draw-dikes, which ſeems to have belonged to a cohort of another kind. The <hi>Legio Sexta Victrix</hi> is upon fine ſtone at Carliſle, but no particular Cohorts appear in this ſpace.</p>
               <p>Julius Caeſar, when he made his firſt deſcent upon Britain, brought over only two Legions with him, which were the 7th and 10th. This latter was his favourite legion, and both together made but an army of 12,000 foot at the moſt. The horſe belonging to theſe legions never reached this iſland, and the foot the ſame year were tranſported back again to Gaul.</p>
               <p>The next year, when Caeſar made his ſecond deſcent, he brought over five Legions with him, and 2000 horſe, which ſeem to be all the horſe that belonged to theſe Legions. There is nothing in the hiſtory whereby it can be known, what Legions theſe were, except the 7th, which is mentioned by Caeſar. Theſe likewiſe returned back again to Gaul, the ſame year in which they came over, as the two Legions had done the year before.</p>
               <p>During the three ſucceeding reigns of Auguſtus, Tiberius, and Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, it is plain the Romans had no footing in Britain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0085300201:65"/>Under Claudius (who applied himſelf in good earneſt to the reduction of Britain) a conſiderable army was ſent to this iſland; the Emperor himſelf afterwards coming over in perſon. This army conſiſted of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Legions and other Auxiliaries, though the hiſtorians have not told us expreſsly what they were, either as to their number or names: but conſidering the ſmall ſucceſs of Julius Caeſar before, and the much greater conqueſts this army made, it is highly reaſonable to ſuppoſe it was ſuperior in number to the greater of Caeſar's, which conſiſted (if the Legions were compleat) of above 30,000 men. It is preſumed, that the army ſent over by Claudius conſiſted of four Legions, with their proper auxilia, and the uſual number of horſe belonging both to one and the other; and this army ſo compoſed would amount to more than 50,000 men. Any conjecture, as to the number or names of the auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary Cohorts, muſt be uncertain and doubtful: but both the number and names of the Legions may be certainly collected from ſome inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental paſſages of Tacitus. They were the ſecond, called Auguſta, the 9th, 14th, and the 20th, uſually called Valens Victrix; each of which are mentioned in the inſcriptions inſerted in this work.</p>
               <p>As we have no evidence from hiſtory, that any new Legions were tranſported by Nero, but that the ſame continued, which had been ſent over at firſt by Claudius; ſo it is plain, from the relation of the battle with Queen Boadicea, that the four Legions laſt mentioned were here under Nero, in whoſe reign this battle happened: for according to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus's account of this matter, the 9th Legion was ſurprized and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by this Queen. The 14th, and the Vexillarii of the 20th, were in the battle, and the ſecond, though in Britain, was abſent from the fight, through the fault of <hi>Poenius Poſthumus,</hi> their Commander, who fell upon his own ſword, when he heard of the glory the troops had acquired in that engagement.</p>
               <p>Of theſe four Legions, one continued very late, and another to the laſt. The Legio XX. VV. though it continued very long here, yet it ſeems to have been recalled before the Romans had entirely abandoned the iſland; for it is not mentioned in the Notitia. The <hi>Legio Secunda Auguſta</hi> is mentioned there, and ſo ſeems to have continued here to the laſt, and to have been the only one that was kept here during the whole time: for though the <hi>Legio Sexta Victrix</hi> did alſo continue to the laſt, yet this came not over till the reign of the Emperor Hadrian. The ninth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0085300201:66"/>
Legion ſeems to have dwindled away entirely, or elſe the ſmall remains of it were incorporated with the Legion ſent over by Hadrian.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable, that the Legions which continued long in Britain, ſeem for the moſt part to have been jointly employed in carrying on the moſt conſiderable works or wars that have been in this iſland. Thus they were jointly engaged in building the wall in Scotland, and moſt or all of them, in erecting thoſe in the north of England: and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and legionary Cohorts ſeem to have been the only ſoldiers who were employed uſually in erecting forts or raiſing fences. Auxiliary Cohorts appear by inſcriptions to have been concerned in ſome other buildings; but forts and fences ſeem to have been the province of the Legionaries, agreeable to that paſſage in Tacitus, <q>the Praefectus Caſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, and legionary Cohorts, who had been left among the Silures for erecting fortifications.</q> Thus among all the inſcriptions found upon the Roman wall in Scotland, there is but one that mentions any aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliary Cohort as having a hand in the work, but always either a Legion or a Vexillation of a Legion. And I take it for granted, that all the centurial inſcriptions upon the face of the wall in the north of England, and which probably were inſerted there at the time of building it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect only the Legions and legionary Cohorts, and yet the Stations upon the wall, as well as moſt of them elſewhere, were garriſoned by the Auxiliaries. The <hi>Legio Secunda Auguſta</hi> came into Britain in the reign of Claudius, under the command of Veſpaſian, and continued in it as long as the Romans had the leaſt footing here. In Hadrian's time this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was in Cumberland, at Netherby and Beau-caſtle, and in the weſtern ſide of Northumberland, and ſo probably had their ſhare in the work of Hadrian's Vallum; or when in the advanced Stations of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therby and Beau-caſtle, they might be poſted there to ſecure thoſe who were employed in that work. In the beginning of the reign of Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus Pius, they were moſt probably upon the eaſtern part of the Roman wall in Northumberland. In Severus's time, it is very probable, they were employed upon the wall that goes by his name.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Legio Sexta Victrix</hi> is uſually thus expreſſed, LEG. VI. V. to which is often added, P. F. that is, Pia fidelis; for that it is to be read ſo rather than Pia felix. It is certain, from a great number of inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and other teſtimonies, that this Legion was a long time in Britain; and it is equally certain, that it came not over ſo ſoon as the others. The account of this Legion whilſt in Britain, muſt be taken chiefly from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0085300201:67"/>
ſuch hints as ancient inſcriptions afford us. I do not find it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in any inſcription belonging to the ſouthern parts of this iſland. It is probable that they made no ſtop in the ſouth, but marched directly by the uſual rout to the weſt end of the Vallum, and had their ſhare in raiſing that work. We have ſeveral inſcriptions on the wall, and near it, in Northumberland and Cumberland, wherein this Legion is mentioned; as at Stanwicks, Cambeck fort, Burdoſwald, Little Cheſters, Houſe-ſteeds, and other places; ſome of which, from the character and other circumſtances, may be ſuppoſed as ancient as Hadrian's reign; the moſt of them do certainly belong to the time of Severus. In the former part of the reign of Antoninus Pius, they were in Scotland, and had their ſhare in building the wall there. Probably they marched along our Watling-ſtreet in the north, either to Scotland or from it, or both; and in their march the ſepulchral inſcription might be erected for a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of this Legion which was found near Richeſter, in Northumberland. Whether this Legion had taken up its ſtated quarters at York, before the reign of Antoninus Pius, and continued there between the time of building the Vallum and their march into Scotland, I cannot certainly determine: however, after their return from Scotland, and about the middle of Antoninus Pius's reign, they were ſettled at York; for Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy places them there: and there, I believe, they ſtatedly quartered, till the very laſt, though they marched at a diſtance from this place, upon ſpecial occaſions. Thus, for inſtance, this Legion was certainly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon the ſtone wall of Severus, as appears, from ſeveral of the centurial inſcriptions found on that wall, which bear the name of this Legion: perhaps ſeveral of its Cohorts might be diſperſed into ſome neighbouring Stations, though York was ſtill the place of its ſtated quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Thus, according to Mr Gale's conjecture, by the <hi>Legio Gordiana,</hi> in the inſcriptions at Lancheſter, in the county of Durham, we are to underſtand the <hi>Legio Sexta Victrix.</hi> The firſt Cohort of this Legion muſt then, in all probability, have been detached at that time from the Legion at York, to aſſiſt in building the works mentioned in theſe inſcriptions. This was in the reign of Gordian, and ſo after this Legion was ſettled at York.</p>
               <p>The Legion called Valeria, or Valeriana, according to ſome, or Valens Victrix, according to moſt, is another of theſe Legions, which were at the firſt ſent over into Britain by Claudius. In the Roman inſcriptions it is thus expreſſed, LEG. XX. VV. but Critics and Antiquaries are not well agreed in reading the former V; ſome will have it to ſtand for Valens,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0085300201:68"/>
and others for Valeria or Valeriana. The motions and employments of this Legion, ſeem to have been much the ſame with the <hi>Legio Secunda Auguſta.</hi> It is probable they were jointly concerned in erecting Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian's Vallum, though we have no inſcriptions to prove it. That this Legion was employed in building the Roman wall in Scotland, under Antoninus Pius, is clear from ſeveral inſcriptions found on the wall, mentioning this Legion or their Vexillatio, and the quantity of the wall which they built. If the altar found at Benwell fort was erected by a Centurion of this Legion, at the ſame time as the other was, by a Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion of the <hi>Legio Secunda Auguſta,</hi> this legion muſt probably have been thereabout in the former part of Antoninus Pius's reign, either doing ſomewhat upon Hadrian's Vallum, or in their march againſt the Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians.</p>
               <p>One would expect, that this Legion bore its part in building Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus's wall; but among all the centurial inſcriptions upon the face of this wall, there is not one of this Legion, or of any Cohort ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it: and yet it appears by an inſcription, that this Legion was employed in ſome work at the Station at Whitley Caſtle, the ancient Alone or Alione.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the fifth century, about the year 402, Theodoſius the Second, when but two years old, was made Emperor, and joined to Arcadius, and Honorius. This Theodoſius reigned half a century; and it is evident, that in his reign the Romans quite abandoned this iſland. It muſt have been much about this time thoſe uſurpers ſtarted up in Britain. Echard ſays, <q>the inhabitants and troops that were quartered in Britain, fearing leaſt the Vandals ſhould paſs over the ſea, and ſubdue them with the reſt, revolted from their obedience to Honorius, and ſet up one Mark, whom they declared Emperor: but they ſoon deprived him of his life and dignity, and placed Gratian in his room, who was a countryman of their own. Within four months they murdered him too, and conferred the ſovereignty upon one Conſtantine, not ſo much in reſpect to his courage or quality, for he was a very inconſiderable man in the army; but in regard to his name, which they looked on as fortunate; hoping he would do as much as Conſtantine the Great had done, who was of the ſame name, and had been advanced to the imperial dignity in the ſame iſland. This new prince, immediately after his promotion, paſſed over into Gaul, and taking with him the very flower of the Britiſh
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0085300201:69"/>
youth, ſo utterly exhauſted the military force of the iſland, that it was wholly broken, and the iſland left naked to new invaders.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Britain being thus drained and exhauſted both of the Roman ſoldiers and its own youth, was, according to Gildas, and Bede after him, much harraſſed by the Picts and Scots, and other invaders; upon which they applied to the Romans for help, who ſent a Legion to their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But the laſt certain account of the Romans' footing in Britain, I believe, is in the Notitia, if it hold true, that this part of it which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Britain, was wrote before the middle of the fifth century, or under the reign of Theodoſius the Second, at which time the Roman force was much abated, though their ſoldiers were not yet finally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from Britain; for beſides a conſiderable number of auxiliary forces, there were yet two Legions at leaſt remaining in this iſland; and the Romans ſeem ſtill to have been in poſſeſſion of that part of the iſland which lays to the South of Severus's wall, though of no part beyond it. The Stations upon the wall were well garriſoned at that time; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Kentiſh coaſt, and the northern frontiers, the garriſons in the other parts of Britain were very thin, and widely diſperſed, and the reſt of England was entirely naked. On the other hand, it is certain (to uſe Echard's words) that under the reign of Valentinian the Third, <q>Africk, Spain, Great Britain, and almoſt all Gaul, Germany, and Illyricum, were diſmembered from the weſtern Empire.</q> Now Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian the Third began to reign with Theodoſius about the year 425, and died in 455; ſo that we may ſafely affirm, that in the beginning of the fifth century, the Roman Power was become low in Britain; and near the middle of that century, the Romans had entirely quitted the iſland.</p>
               <p>I have dwelt long on this ſubject; Mr Warburton in his preface ſays, <q>All antiquaries that I have converſed with, who have made the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed tour of Europe, allow the Picts Wall to be the moſt ſuperb remains of Roman grandeur, that is now to be ſeen on this ſide the Alps." And he adds, "The venerable remains of Monaſteries and Caſtles, with other Monuments of Antiquity, are not to be equalled in any nation or country whatſoever.</q>

floor of one of the apartments was lately cleared, and diſcovered to be of ſingular conſtruction; conſiſting of three tiers of flags, laid upon ſtratas of ſand. Some of the walls are nine feet thick: the caſing in many places has been taken away, to erect the adjoining tenements. The builder has even been afraid of the light, for the apertures are no larger than thoſe in the ſtair-caſes of ancient caſtles. The whole carries the appearance of a horrid gloomy dungeon, where its ancient tyrants dealt in deeds of darkneſs. The laſt of the Thirlwall family, Eleanora, ſold this caſtle, with its demeſnes, to the Earl of Carliſle.</p>
               <p>Under the ſouth front of this caſtle the Roman wall croſſes the Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and ſtretches up the oppoſite eminences. The name of Thirlwall, by ſome authors, has been derived from thoſe breaches made in the wall by the Scots, in their incurſions.</p>
               <p>Spelman's calculation of the Roman forces ſtationed on the wall, makes them amount to the number 13,800, allowing 600 to a cohort; excluſive of a whole legion, and 13 detachments of horſe and foot, on other ſtations, and attendants on the Emperor. Conſtantine created an officer ſtiled "Comes Spectabilis Litoris Saxonici," who commanded ſeven companies of foot, two troops of horſe, the ſecond legion, and a cohort to guard the coaſts. In the reign of Nero, ſome authors alledge, the Roman army in Britain conſiſted of 70,000.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ph. Tranſ. No. 337.</note>

               <p>In paſſing down the road below Thirlwall Caſtle, we perceived a large ſtone lay in the way, which bore marks of the ſculptor. We had curioſity to examine it, and found it the head of a Coloſſian ſtatue, meaſuring in circumference near five feet, cut on a rag-ſtone. It ſeemed to appertain to ſome ſtatue of Jupiter, and probably was rolled down the ſteeps from Carr-Voran, and lodged in the river Tippal.</p>

               <p>is little more than a mile: the Vallum of this ſtation is very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable, of an oblong ſquare, near the dimenſions of Carr-Voran; the interior parts rugged, from the ruins of many buildings. In the courſe of the Notitia, this ſtation is called Aeſica. It was garriſoned by the Cohors Prima Aſtorum, but no inſcriptions have been found here, that mention this or any other cohort.</p>
               <p>Great Cheſters muſt be reckoned, Mr Horſley ſays, among the forts that have been well preſerved: the ramparts about it are very viſible; ſome part of the original ſtone wall is ſtanding a good height; the ditch is alſo to be ſeen on all ſides, but towards the eaſt, where it is ſomewhat flat. On the weſt ſide there is a double Agger and ditch. The ruins of the rampart on this ſide are very high: ſeveral regular courſes of ſtones are to be ſeen in this ſide of the rampart, where the ruins have been cleared out. The Praetorium is very viſible, being about 50 yards from eaſt to weſt, and 40 from north to ſouth. To this is joined another parallelogram at the eaſt end, of the ſame breadth with the Praetorium, and 26 yards from eaſt to weſt. This I take to have been the Queſtorum. On the north ſide of the Praetorium are large ruins of ſome conſiderable building, which probably was a temple. On the ſouth ſide of the fort has been a regular entry. Part of the jambs and ſome other ſtones are remaining entire; which may ſhew for what purpoſe ſuch ſtones muſt have been, which are found in other
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0085300201:75"/>
Roman forts. Some pieces of an iron gate and hinges have been found in the ruins not long ago. From this gate there goes a paved military way to Hadrian's Vallum, which is diſtant about 15 chains, which way is alſo continued till it joins the other military way. The out-buildings are moſt conſiderable on the ſouth ſide, though there are alſo ſome on the eaſt. There are vaſt ruins of buildings in this field, which, as uſual, has a gentle deſcent, and is open to the ſouth.</p>
               <p>The diſtance between this ſtation and Little Cheſters, the next in my rout, is about three miles and three quarters; and here again all the Caſtella are viſible, being four in number, beſides one more which ſeems to have fallen in with the ſtation at Great Cheſters. The interval here again between the Caſtella is ſeven furlongs.</p>
               <p>A little to the weſt of Great Cheſters, near a houſe called Cockmount Hill, the Picts wall begins again to aſcend the rocks. From Great Cheſters to this place the ditch is but faint, except for two or three chains, where it is diſtinct.</p>
               <p>A little to the weſt of Walltown, and between that and Carr-Voran, there is a part of the wall which is in the greateſt perfection of any now remaining in the whole track: it is about three yards high, as I before obſerved, has about 14 regular courſes, and at one part 16, of the facing ſtones entire.</p>
               <p>As for Hadrian's Vallum, it is viſible all the way till it comes near Carr-Voran. It paſſes near Low Town, juſt on the ſouth of it; and particularly the vallum or rampart on the ſouth brink of the ditch, is here very viſible. Mr Horſley ſays he was informed there were the ruins of ſome Roman works at Low Town, but upon viewing them, nothing like it appeared. They look (he ſays) ſomewhat like the houſes of Moſs Troopers, which ſeems confirmed by what Camden ſays, <q>that he durſt venture no further this way for fear of them.</q> He mentions Carr-Voran on the one ſide, and Carraw on the other; ſo that the two Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the Houſe-ſteads muſt have been the ſtations that he was afraid to viſit.</p>
               <p>The diſtance between Great Cheſters and Carr-Voran is almoſt two miles and a quarter. In this ſpace there are three Caſtella, and all of them viſible.</p>

               <figure/>
               <p>Mr Horſley, No. 64, gives a monument very like this in figure, but the inſcription varies greatly:

                     <l>PERVICAE FILIA F</l>

which he reads, dis manibus Pervicae filia fecit.—A funeral monument erected for one Pervica, by her daughter who is not named.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0085300201:77"/>I took the drawing and inſcription with great attention, and am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe the whole monument is here repreſented with truth.</p>
               <p>At the mill gate a ſtone placed upſide-down has this inſcription:
<q>
                     <l>D. M.</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Horſley gives this inſcription in the ſame manner, but his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſtone has a man's head above the inſcription. This might be ſunk in the earth, as the ſtone now ſerves for a gate-poſt, and is reverſed. Dis manibus Aelio Mercuriali, Corniculario Vacia ſoror fecit. This is a funeral monument erected for Aelis Mercurialis, by his ſiſter Vacia. A Cornicularius was an inferior officer under the Tribune. Mention is made of the Cornicularius, by M. Laetorius Mergus the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune by Valerius Maximus; and Suetonius, ſpeaking of Orbilius the grammarian, ſays, "In Macedonio Corniculo mox equo meruit." The name of this officer is upon ſeveral monuments in Gruter, and occurs frequently in the Notitia: he was a kind of a clerk or ſecretary, and in the lower times of the empire, he was rather of higher rank or quality than before.</p>
               <p>Camden ſays, this was the ſecond Station of the Dalmatians, called in the old book of Notices MAGNA; and that Sir Robert Cotton took from hence the two following inſcriptions:

Mr Gordon was the firſt, I believe, who diſcovered or took any notice of it; but his draught has ſeveral defects in it, the moſt conſiderable of which is the omiſſion of the two eagles, on whoſe wings the victories ſtand that ſupport the vexillum: each eagle reſts upon the branch of a tree; and the boar on the right plainly appears to take hold of the ſtock of the tree on that ſide, as if he endeavoured to tear it up: the other boar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks the vexillum, and lays hold of the tree, on which the other eagle is perched, with both his feet. I think there can be no doubt but the boars and trees were deſigned to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this wild and woody country, as it then was; and the Roman enſigns often ſignify a Roman ſettlement: this ſculpture therefore plainly denotes the Roman conqueſt of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, their victories over the inhabitants, and their making a ſettlement here, in oppoſition to all the attempts of their enemies. The heads of the eagles are both broken off, but the reſt of them is very diſtinct.</q>

                     <p>Urn burial is not ſo ancient as the preſent mode of interment: burning the dead is firſt attributed to the Greeks, and Herculus is ſaid to be the firſt of the Greeks who uſed it. This he did to free himſelf from the obligation of an oath. He had ſworn to bring back a youth to his father from the ſiege of Troy, and he had no way of doing it but by preſenting him with his aſhes. From the Greeks this cuſtom paſſed to the Romans, but it was not general among them. From the authority of Pliny it appears, that it was not uſed in many families, and that Sylla the Dictator was the firſt of the Cornelii whoſe body was burnt; which is the reaſon aſſigned by Antiquaries, why we find Roman bones both burnt and unburnt. It was the choice of ſome, becauſe they would preſerve their bodies from the reſentment of their enemies. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Inſtruments and coins of that metal, belonging to the northern nations, and where they are found in Tumuli unqueſtionably Roman, they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been taken from the enemy, and thrown into it in honour of the deceaſed. The Roman Tumuli were ceſpititious or mounts of earth like thoſe here. Such was Hector's <q>viridi ceſpite,</q> Virg. Such was Dercennus's "terreno ex aggere buſtom," Virg.

               <p>a ſmall Roman ſtation, laying on the weſtern ſide of Bardon Burn, now called the Bowers, on account of the trees which cover it. It doth not contain above three acres of land in its incloſure, the Vallum of which is very diſtinguiſhable, forming an oblong ſquare with obtuſe angles.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0085300201:81"/>
The Via Vacinalis from Carr-Voran to Walwick Cheſters, paſſeth cloſe by its northern ſide, near which a Roman military guide ſtone is ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and at a mile weſt another; and again, another mile further weſt, a third, in a direct line. Theſe ſtones are cylindrical, ſix feet four inches in circumference, and near ſix feet above ground. On one of theſe is the following inſcription: BONO REIpVBLICAE NATO, the letters large and coarſe. No doubt this was a compliment to the Emperor then reigning, and not an uncommon one.</p>
               <p>Little Cheſters was the Vindolana of the Romans, where the Legio Sexta Victrix kept garriſon; as alſo the Cohors Quarta Gallorum, as the inſcriptions found here prove.</p>
               <p>Mr Horſley's deſcription of this ſtation is as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This ſtation is ſouth from both the walls near a mile and three quarters, but ſtands on the military way before mentioned, which is very viſible for a conſiderable ſpace from this ſtation: ſo that Little Cheſters muſt be reckoned among thoſe which belong to the wall, it being in this rout, and the only military way, which belongs to it, coming from the wall and returning to it.</q>

                  <q>There are two or three Forts more, as Carr-Voran and Cambeck Fort, detached to the ſouth of the wall, though none ſo far as this; yet this is not above half a mile from Hadrian's Vallum.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This is one of the leaſt Stations on the wall. It is only ſeven chains long from north to ſouth, and four broad from eaſt to weſt. The ramparts are viſible quite round, and very large, but the ditch is near filled up. The town or out-buildings here have been chiefly to the weſt and ſouth-weſt of the fort; there being a ſmall brook to the ſouth-eaſt, and a deſcent from the Station to it. The Praetorium may be diſtinguiſhed; and there ſeems to have been ſome towers at the corners of the fort, and perhaps two in the ſides of the ramparts.</q>

               <p>The Royal Society received a few years ago ſome Roman Sandals found here. A Roman Hypocauſtum or Sudatory was diſcovered here, of which Dr Hunter gave the following deſcription:—<q>It was a ſquare room vaulted above, and paved with large ſquare ſtones ſet in lime: under which was a lower apartment ſupported by rows of ſquare pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, about half a yard high—the upper room had 16 flues in the walls then open, and appearing as niches; the pavement and roof were tinged with ſmoak.</q> Theſe ſudatories, from this deſcription, were certainly heated by flues in the wall like the modern ſtoves. Mr Horſley ſpeaking of it, ſays it looks very like a Balneum with the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocauſtum below it: and ſomewhat of this nature I ſaw at Lancheſter and Riſingham; at the latter place it was not far from the Praetorium. —An engraving is given by Mr Horſley of a ſculpture found here; the principal figure of which repreſents Mercury. He gives the following deſcription of it. Mercury is repreſented with his <hi>caduceus</hi> in his left hand, and <hi>purſe</hi> in his right. Above his right arm is ſomewhat like a <hi>petaſus,</hi> or perhaps a cap of liberty. The head of the figure and upper part of the ſtone is broken and confuſed, ſo that we cannot be certain, whether or no Mercury has had his <hi>petaſus</hi> on. If we could be ſure that he was here repreſented, as wearing his <hi>petaſus</hi> on his head, I ſhould then have thought it more probable, that this other figure was the cap of liberty. Mercury's looſe and flying <hi>chlamys</hi> is viſible; and beſide him an altar with this inſcription upon it: DEO

                     <p>It is plain from Camden's own account of his journey, that he went no further along the wall eaſtward, than a little beyond Carr-Voran. The altar now before us was erected to the Syrian goddeſs. Lucian among the ancients, and Selden among the moderns, have profeſſedly treated on the ſubject of this deity: and Sir Iſaac Newton ſays, it is one of the names of Venus. It is very certain, that what is phyſically the ſame, is often repreſented by ſeveral deities; and the ſame deity has ſeveral names conſidered under different relations, or as confering different benefits. Thus Cybele, Ceres, Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What Cohort this Licinius Clemens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, is not ſo clear to me from the inſcription: I know ſome read it Cohors Prima Hami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum at large, and have ſo repreſented it; but this I doubt has been mere conjecture: it is plain that the letters in the laſt line are not placed at a due diſtance, and that the letters on each ſide
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0085300201:85"/>ſhould be farther removed from the four, and the ſame room which is ſufficient for Harniorum, will do as well or better for Gallorum; and I cannot but ſuſpect this to be the true reading. The former inſcription favours this conjecture, and ſo I read it at firſt ſight of the copy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering where it was found. If this conjecture ſhould be admitted, this inſcription does further confirm the Station at Little Cheſters to be Vindolana.</p>

There is a ſmall break in the right ſide of the altar, whereby a letter or two is defaced, but the reſt ſtill continues legible. I think voto in the fifth line muſt be ex voto, as uſual, and then there is no difficulty as to the meaning. The writing part of the word libens, upon the plane of the altar, and part upon the baſe, is obſervable, but the S. for ſacrum, in the end of the fourth line, is not uncommon. The expreſs date of this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion adds to its value; namely, when Tuſcus and Baſſus were Conſuls, that is, according to Camden, in the year 259, but in the Faſti Conſulares 258, where the former name is Fuſcus inſtead of Tuſcus.</p>

hecatombs and mighty ſlaughters, which ſtained the altars of Roman devotees, we might conceive the country abounded in cattle, or the havoc and waſte of ſuch a profuſe gift to the gods would endanger a famine. The firſt impreſſions of the unlettered reader on theſe acts of devotion, would miſlead him into an idea, that theſe ſacrifices were only
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0085300201:86"/>
a laviſh deſtruction of animal beings, under the irrational preſumption, that the gods delighted in the ſervice of burning carcaſſes: but by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the ceremony, we are relieved from this miſtake, and acquit this learned and poliſhed people of ſuch an error againſt common ſenſe. —From national prejudices they had aſſigned perſons to the attributes of the Great Creator, whom they univerſally confeſſed; and preſumed to depict them, as being diſtinct emanations from the ſupreme, by the figures of Apollo, Bacchus, Pallas, Ceres, and all the multitude of their divine perſonages; yet by the intelligent and wiſe, the religious ſervices paid to the images of thoſe attributes, were in fact, and from the heart, addreſſed to the God of Nature. Seneca ſays, <q>'tis of very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence by what name you call <hi>the firſt Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> which preſides over the univerſe, and fills all the parts of it; he is ſtill the ſame God. He is called Jupiter Stator, not as hiſtorians ſay, becauſe he ſtopped the flying armies of the Romans, but becauſe he is the conſtant ſupport of all beings—they call him Fate, becauſe he is the firſt Cauſe on which all others depend. We Stoics ſometimes call him Father Bacchus, becauſe he is the univerſal Life that animates nature—Hercules, becauſe his Power is invincible—Mercury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the eternal Wiſdom, Order, and Reaſon—you may give him as many names as you pleaſe, provided you allow <hi>but one ſole Principle</hi> every where preſent.</q>—Thus, if the Roman devotee peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for ſucceſs in war, he reſorted to the temple of Mars, or raiſed to him an altar; and ſo on, through the chain of thoſe images, with which their pantheon was crowded.</p>
               <p>This error aroſe very early in the world; and before letters commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated wiſdom and ſcience, it is no wonder it prevailed almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally among mankind—the eye carries images to the mind moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately—the mind thus impreſſed was warmed into an energy, which nothing but outward objects could convey to the ignorant. Beſides, we find thoſe perſonages, who had rendered themſelves important to their country, and by their ſuperior talents and virtues, won the love of the people, in commemoration of ſuch their excellencies, had their images erected, and became repreſentatives of the divine attributes.— Here we trace a ſtrong influence to promote devotion; the love borne to the very perſon whoſe image was ſo erected. The danger to religion among the vulgar is obvious, and was proved in the event: the great architype was forgotten, and the ſmoaky and inanimate ſtatue became the idol of the vulgar worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0085300201:87"/>Let us now examine the ſacrificial rites.—The altars which remain in Britain, are chiefly formed of one ſtone, like the pedeſtal of a column: above the cornice are two rolls, commonly called the horns of the altar; the centre riſes in a conical figure, in which is an aperture, wherein was placed the charcoal and embers for the ceremony. Theſe altars were fixed before the ſtatue of the God to whom the devotee paid his rites, or at the Oſtium of the temple, which during the time had its gates thrown open; or otherwiſe, they were erected in groves, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the Divinity: the Prieſt, together with the devotee, dreſſed in white garments (emblematical of purity and innocence, characteriſtics preſumed moſt acceptable to heaven) went foremoſt in the proceſſion. The animal ordered for ſacrifice had its horns gilt, or its forehead bound with white fillets, decked with garlands, and crowned with the leaves of that tree, which it was ſuppoſed the Deity moſt affected; but in fact, that which was eſteemed emblematical of the peculiar virtue of the Deity then addreſſed. Several attendants walked in the proceſſion, amongſt whom were the public Crier, the Muſicians, the Aruſpex or Diviner, and all thoſe whoſe office it was to ſlaughter and dreſs the animal. As ſoon as the Victim was brought, the Prieſt, laying one hand on the horns of the altar, began the ceremony with a moſt ſolemn and devout prayer, either for the public weal, or the private proſperity of the devotee offering ſacrifice, as the occaſion required. The ſacred fire being placed in the aperture of the altar, the Prieſt ſtrewed corn and frankincenſe, meal and ſalt, upon the head of the animal; then taking the Patera, (a ſhallow baſon) in which was contained the wine, he touched it with his lips, and after giving it to thoſe who ſtood near him to do the ſame, poured it between the horns of the beaſt; then plucking ſome hair from between them, he caſt it into the fire, and turning his face to the eaſt, drew his knife along the animal's ſpine, from head to tail, as the enſign or mark of conſecration: after which, the inferior officers performed the ſlaughter. The carcaſs being opened, the Aruſpex examined the inteſtines, and if deformed, deficient, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, he pronounced the omens inauſpicious: if on the contrary, healthy and vigorous, the heart large, and the animal parts ſtrong, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications were propitious. After this ceremony, particular ſmall parts were placed on the embers, to occaſion a pleaſant ſavour, and the reſt was dreſſed for a ſolemn feſtival. Here we view the ceremony in its proper light: the ſacrificial rites were no more than a public exhibition of the cattle, given on ſome ſingular occaſion, when they were preſented
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0085300201:88"/>
before heaven with prayers, the Prieſt imploring a bleſſing. It is a doubt with me, whether, by men of enlightened minds, whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding overlooked the idol, and whoſe religion ſpiritually addreſſed the only true God, theſe were not acts of piety and fervent devotion, equal to moſt we find in this age.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note> We have avoided Scylla, and ſunk in Charybdis. To reform the abuſes of the heathen world, we have too much aboliſhed ceremony; and from fervour, have fallen into a ſlovenly lethargic indolence, which comprehends ſo little of piety, that men often find their minds, even during the act of kneeling, abſtracted from the Divinity, and wandering in worldly occupations. We have taken away the idol, which betrayed the vulgar, but have left them in ſuch jeopardy, that few even remember there is a God. Religious rites warm the mind: pure and ſentimental devotion only befits the moſt enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and moſt learned: ceremonies catch attention, as it were in wiles; and thoſe who would think little of prayer, may ſometimes be induced thereto almoſt involuntarily, by joining in, or being preſent at religious rites. The ſoul full of wiſdom, worſhips in ſilence; but wayward minds ſoon ſink away from ſuch ſpiritual ſervice. The contemplation of the Deity, by the enlightened and wiſe, is ſo replete with wonder, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires ſuch reverence, that ſilence becomes it beſt: but the ignorant mind conceives little more than its wants; and the God of miracles, with ſuch, is concluded in the God of daily bread. I reverence the Roman in his ſacrifice: it was a noble exhibition of piety; an auguſt mode of ſupplicating the Deity. The ſolemnity of craving a grace on the appointed feſtival in theſe rites, was ſtrikingly devout. In this boaſted age of chriſtianity, where is the devotion attendant on the hecatombs of a Lord Mayor's Feaſt. The hecatombs of the Ancients, were feſtivals on great and memorable events, and were preceded by the moſt ſolemn rites of conſecration;—a commencement of feſtivity, worthy the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt enlightened nations.</p>

occaſion, through all they did, as a nation, as is no where elſe to be found in the leaſt comparable. To enumerate particulars, would make an agreeable volume. I can only take notice, that it makes a great part of their ſtory. So honeſt, ſo warm, ſo grateful was their zeal to heaven, at every public act, that providence could not but look favourably upon them, wink at what they were ignorant of, as the the Apoſtle profeſſes, Acts xvii. 30. and proſper them accordingly. Every ſingle perſon, of any note, had a part of his houſe conſecrated, like as our private chapels, called the Lararium. Upon every ſucceſs, we read of their vowing temples. On occaſion of misfortune, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, floods, thunder, and the like, they conſult the oracles, order public luſtrations, ſupplications, and ſacrifices. Even their theatrical ſpectacles began with an act of religion; many altars in their circs and places of games. They never began or ended a war, took up the military ſtandards every morning, without an act of religion, a liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of incenſe. In their kalendar, moſt days in the year have ſome religious ſolemnity. Look into their ſculptures and monuments, and obſerve the extravagant expence and pomp of their religious proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: even their coins are counter-ſigned with ſome Deity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſculptures of their Emperors ſacrificing, incenſing. They never began their harveſt, their vintage, without a ſacrifice: without the <hi>Flamen Dialis</hi> gathering the firſt bunch. The genius of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and city were ever repreſented with a Patera in its hand, before an altar incenſing. In ſhort, religion makes the greateſt part of the hiſtory; the greateſt part of thoſe authors that write of their cuſtoms; the greateſt part of the monuments, coins, and ſculptures, which are now come to our hands, of this truly magnanimous and virtuous people. And if we read Polybius particularly, we obtain a juſt idea of the noble ſpirit, the honour, and uprightneſs of the Roman ſenate, which made them courted by all the world. Religion cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Roman hiſtory, becauſe, in <hi>their</hi> way, they were the moſt religious of all people; and for that reaſon, Providence gave them the Empire of the World.</q>

I was told, when I was at <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> of much ſuch another vault, with aſhes and burnt bones in it. When the Romans were forced to quit this country, they might very probably throw theſe two altars into the vault, and cover them up, to preſerve them from being prophaned by the Barbarians that poſſeſſed themſelves of it upon their retreat; and they were effectually concealed from them by their lying bid ſo many hundred years as they did.</p>

monuments erected here, plainly ſhew, that their ſettled quarters were at this place, and continued here the lateſt.</p>
               <p>Mr Horſley ſays, <q>I cannot ſay that Hadrian's Vallum has made the ſouth rampart of this Station, but I think it has paſſed not much to the ſouth, and ſeems to have made a ſmall turn juſt at the brook, in order to come near, if not up to it. The ſouthern boundary of this Station is uncertain, though the other limits are diſtinct. The ditch about the Station is alſo flat and obſcure. Severus's wall makes the north rampart. From ſouth to north it is about five chains, and from eaſt to weſt about ſeven. The area of the moſt northerly part of the Station is nearly plain; but the ſouth part is more upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent than any other Station that I remember. I think the Praetorium is viſible, and the ruins of a temple near it. The vaſt ruins of the Roman Station and Town are truly wonderful; and a great number of inſcriptions and ſculptures have been found, and many yet remain at this place. The town or out-buildings have ſtood upon a gentle declivity, to the ſouth and ſouth-eaſt of the Station, where there are ſtreets, or ſomewhat that looks like terraſſes.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>From this Station there ſeems to have gone a military way to Little Cheſters, ſome faint veſtiges of which I thought I obſerved, but was not certain. As ſuch a military way might be of ſervice for march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forces from one of theſe Stations to the other, ſo it might alſo be further uſeful, for a more convenient paſſage from Houſe-ſteads to Carr-Voran, or to any other Stations along the wall more weſterly. Near to this way, and to that part of Houſe-ſteads where a temple is ſuppoſed to have ſtood, are ſome old wrought quarries, now grown over with graſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The diſtance between Little Cheſters and Houſe-ſteads is about a mile and three quarters, and the diſtance between Houſe-ſteads and that part of the wall which is directly oppoſite to Little Cheſters is about a mile and three furlongs; and in this ſpace there are two vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Caſtella, the interval between which ſeems to be juſt about ſix furlongs. This is the leaſt interval between any two Caſtella upon the whole track of the wall; the reaſon of which may be the diſtance of the Station at Little Cheſters from the wall.</q>

                     <p>This and the following altars were dug up at a place now called the Chapel Hill, ſuppoſed to be the ruins of a conſiderable temple. The inſcriptions were, not long after the diſcovery of them, publiſhed in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, by Dr Hunter, by Mr Warburton, and lately again by Mr Gordon: they are alſo in Camden's Britannia. The unuſual ſhape of the I in the capital is remarkable: the Tungri mentioned in this and the following inſcriptions, were a people of Belgic Gaul. The next thing which deſerves conſideration is, what we are to underſtand by Numina Auguſti in this and other inſcriptions, where thoſe words occur: Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not agreed as to this, and probably it has not always the ſame meaning: here and in ſome other inſtances, it ſhould ſeem, as if thoſe Deities were meant, to which the Emperor was peculiarly devoted; and that they who erected the altars, complimented the Emperor, by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour and profeſſing their devotion to the ſame Deities. We find ſeveral inſcriptions in Gruter, that are conſecrated Numinibus Auguſti, and one like this I. O. M. et Numinibus Auguſti: and that addreſſes were made to the Gods in behalf of the Emperors, notwithſtanding they were often complimented as Deities themſelves, is likewiſe evident from many of their coins, on which we have Jovi, Apollini, Marti, Mercurio, conſevatori Auguſti, with ſeveral others of a like nature: however ſome have thought, that if this interpretation ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, Jupiter Optimus Maximus would be excluded from the number of the Emperors Deities; but in anſwer to this it may be ſaid, that either the words may be ſo underſtood as if it had been expreſſed, Jovi Optimo Maximo et (ceteris) Numinibus Auguſti, or elſe that Jupiter is by way of eminency, diſtinguiſhed from the Lares or tutelar Gods of the Emperor, which were often many in number, and made up partly of deceaſed perſons, as well as other fictitious Deities. So Flavius Vopiſcus, in his life of Aurelius, ſpeaking of his going into the temple of Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus, ſays, <q>There he found that image of the Deity which he ſaw favouring him in the war:</q> and Julius Capitolinus, in the life of Aurelius, addreſſed to the Emperor Diocleſian, ſays, <q>The ſtatues of Marcus Antoninus are to this day ſet up in many houſes among the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Deities;</q> and ſoon after, <q>He is to this time eſteemed a God, as you always thought, and do think, moſt ſacred Emperor Diocleſian, who worſhip him among your Deities, not as the reſt, but in a peculiar manner.</q> But in ſome other inſcriptions the word Numina, in the plural, is applied to a particular Deity; ſo we have Numina Dianae in Horace, and in Virgil, Numina Phoebi; and what comes nearer to our purpoſe, the ſame poet, when ſpeaking of Auguſtus himſelf, and by his ſordid flattery ranking him among the Gods; but uncertain where to place him, uſes theſe words:
<q>
                           <l>Au Deus immenſi venias maris, actua nautae</l>

On one ſide of this altar is a Praefericulum, and on the other a Patera, each included in a waved ornament. I dare not venture poſitively to ſay, theſe inſcriptions are as old as Antoninus Pius, though I know of no other in this form but theſe here at Houſe-ſteads, and one upon the altar at Benwell, which laſt expreſsly mentions this Emperor; nor do I think, that any objection, againſt this antiquity of them, can be taken from the cut of the letters, or the numeral ſtroke above the I, which have nothing in them that favours the lower times: I only add, that ſome gentlemen chooſe to read theſe inſcriptions Cohortis Primae Tungrorum Milites.</p>

This copy is without doubt incorrect, though the main deſign is obvious enough.

                     <p>This inſcription is upon a piece of an altar, the upper part being broken off and loſt. It has been publiſhed in the Philoſ Tranſactions by Dr Hunter, and more lately by Mr Gordon. But in both, the remains of two imperfect letters in the break at the top are neglected: and yet I take theſe to be material, becauſe the laſt is plainly the half of an inverted C, the uſual mark

But the account we have of them in Camden's Britannia, ſeems to me not ſo exact. For what is there called a Mercury, is plainly a Victory. And we are told of the ſtatues of Jupiter, Bacchus, and a Flamen, which by all I can poſſibly diſcern, are only the figures of two Roman ſoldiers, and three female figures, ſuppoſed to be the Deae Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres or Campeſtres. The firſt is a Victory ſtanding upon a globe on the right foot, the left being caſt behind in the attitude of alighting, or of taking flight.

                     <p>Theſe are three female figures ſeated. The draught given by Mr Horſley, he ſays, was taken from the originals. They are naked to the waiſt, and their legs naked up to the knees, and therefore (he ſays) I know not the reaſon why Mr Gordon, who publiſhed them before, has drawn them with their legs covered down to the ancles. The figures have loſt their heads. Theſe are not improbably ſuppoſed to be local Goddeſſes, or the Deae Matres or Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtres. We have three female figures repreſented together at two other places in this Roman Station, which I ſhall deſcribe in their order. The veſſels which theſe three have in their hands, appear not unlike the Colathus or Modius, on the heads of Sorapis and Fortune, and oft upon the heads of the Roman Emperors; which may favour the opinion of their being the Deae Campeſtres, who in theſe parts had the care of corn and country affairs, and were ſuppoſed to give plenty. Whether theſe veſſels be of that ſort, or whether they repreſent thoſe in which the ſortes or lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0085300201:97"/>whether there being three in number has any relation to the number of the Parcae, I ſhall leave to others to explain. Perhaps their ſavage dreſs may have ſome reference to that madneſs which was always aſcribed to the Matres, or ancient Propheteſſes.</p>
                     <p n="49">XLIX.</p>
                     <p>About a furlong or leſs to the eaſt, near the ſide of a brook, and cloſe to a hedge, are three other female figures, ſeated, each in a ſeparate chair. Mr Gordon takes notice of two only, but a third was alſo lying near the others, covered with graſs and buſhes. The heads and hands are broken off from all the three, and the drapery is ſomewhat different in all of them. They are intended to be repreſented as ſitting. The firſt in the plate is naked to the waiſt, her veſt makes ſeveral folds above the knee, and falls about half way down to her ancles; the reſt of the legs covered with a kind of ſtockings. The ſecond is naked to the waiſt, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo forms many folds about the knees, and falls about half way down the legs, which are naked to the feet. The chair in which this figure is placed, has two ſide feet and a center foot, round which a cord is twiſted, paſſing thrice round each leg, as binding the figure to the chair. The third figure has its veſt up ſo as to conceal the breaſts, the robe deſcends a little below the knees, from whence the lower parts of the legs are naked. Mr Ward ſubjoins, <q>I am inclined to think theſe ſix figures were originally placed in ſome temple, built in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man town adjoining to this Station, together with the three following, whom I do not take to be Deities, but rather Prieſteſſes, two of which hold ſome ſort of veſſel in their right hands, as a ſymbol of their office. The difference of their habit ſeems to favour this opinion, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that of their poſture; for they are ſtanding, which is the poſture of attendants, but the others ſit, which was always eſteemed a poſture of Majeſty.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At this place there lies a broken altar of the largeſt ſize, but no viſible letters upon it.</p>

                     <p>In the Station itſelf, and againſt a hedge, were three other female figures, but ſtanding, which are publiſhed likewiſe by Mr Gordon. The Sea Goat and two fiſhes above, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have ſome reference to Britain's being an iſland. The Sea Goat occurs in ſome other ſculptures found in the north.</p>
                     <p>The veſſels which theſe hold in their hands, do not appear like the Patera. They may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be intended for Vaſes of the ſame ſort with thoſe in the hands of the three ſitting, only in another poſition. If they are veſſels into which the Sortes were put, theſe figures may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the action of throwing them out. It may not be amiſs to obſerve here, that Virgil in the Prophecy of Helenus, uſes the expreſſion ſortiri fata for the decrees of heaven.</p>

                     <p>In the ſculpture inſcribed Deabus Mairabus in Montſaucon, the Goddeſſes are repreſented ſtanding, in an attitude not very unlike theſe. The middle figure there holds fruit, either in a veſſel or in the folding of her garment; the figure on the right hand holds a veſſel he calls a Patera, and ſhe on the left holds a branch downwards. That great Antiquary obſerves, that the Ancients uſually made three of thoſe Goddeſſes that were worſhipped in the plural number, whether good or bad; as the Gorgons, the Graeae, the daughters of Phorcus; as alſo the Parcae, the Sirenes, the Harpyies, the Heſperides, the Stymphalides, the Graces, nay even the Sibyls, and the Muſes according to the moſt ancient authors.</p>

                     <p>Mr Gordon, when upon the ſpot with Baron Clark, dog up from the ruins of the Roman town here, a ſmall ſtatue of a ſoldier in the Roman military habit, holding a ſpear in his right hand, and reſting with his left upon a ſhield. This is now in the Baron's collection.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo in the ſame honourable perſon's collection, two other ſmall altars found here; but as they have no inſcriptions, or any thing remarkable about them, I have not given the draughts.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all theſe, there are likewiſe ſeveral other pieces of ſculptures, altars, pedeſtals, and pillars ſcattered here and there; and one piece of a fine channelled pillar lying in the midſt of the Station. There may be two or three other Stations in Britain (as Burdoſwald, Elenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and Lancheſter) that exceed this in number of inſcriptions; but none I think equal it, as to the extent of the ruins of the town, or the number, variety, and curioſity of the ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which yet remain here.</p>
                     <p>There is one inſcription more which belongs to this place, that was publiſhed in the Tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by Dr Hunter, ſeveral years ago.

               <p>between the military road and the wall, near the 28th mile-ſtone; the remains of a Roman Station, about ſixty yards ſquare, which Camden concludes was Hunnum, where the Notitia places the wing Sabiniani.

               <p>near the 25th mile-ſtone, the Roman Station Procolitia, garriſoned by the firſt Cohort of the Batavians. Severus's military way appears to enter the eaſt gate of the fort, and go out at the weſt. A great part of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0085300201:96"/>
the rampart here ſtill continues very entire, eſpecially on the eaſt ſide; and Severus's wall, which forms the north rampart, is in good preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The ditch is moſt viſible on the weſt. Here it may plainly be ſeen, that the corners of the forts were not ſtrictly angular, but turned off in a quarter of a circle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0085300201:97"/>According to Mr Horſley, the buildings without this fort have been chiefly on the weſt ſide, where, ſome years ago, a well was diſcovered with a good ſpring: the receptacle for the water is about ſeven feet ſquare within, and built on all ſides with hewn ſtone: it is now almoſt filled up with rubbiſh. There had alſo been a wall about it, or a houſe built over it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0085300201:98"/>From this fort to the village of Carraw, Hadrian's Vallum and ditch are not very conſpicuous; but Severus's wall is very viſible, though the ditch is obſcure. About half a mile ſouth-weſt from Carraw, upon a high ground, is a ſquare fort, now called Broom-dykes: it is as large as the fort of Carraw-brough, and probably has been for exploration, or for the Aeſtiva of this fort About half-way between Carraw and Thropfell-houſe, there ſeems to be ſome veſtiges of the ſmaller military way, ſuppoſed to have gone cloſe by Severus's wall, from turret to turret.</p>
               <p>For about a mile the walls keep near to each other, and for that ſpace are themſelves and all their members very large and conſpicuous; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the regular ſtones appear in Severus's wall, and the united mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary way is very noble. After this the walls part, and take different courſes. The north Agger of Hadrian's fortification, continues after the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0085300201:99"/>
ſeparation large and high; is mixed with ſtones, though no regular pavement appears: whereas Severus's military way, after this parting, appears little raiſed, but regularly paved. Hadrian's Vallum keeps the low ground all the way, whilſt Severus's runs along the brink of the precipices, which in ſome places ſeem to have been made ſteeper by art, in order to render them more inacceſſable. For this reaſon Severus's wall is for this ſpace very crooked, whilſt Hadrian's in the main is pretty ſtraight. They have made no ditch to Severus's work, when they had the advantage of a precipice; nor was there the leaſt occaſion: but in theſe intervals between the rocks, they have often drawn a ditch, and in theſe places uſually erected their Caſtella.</p>
               <p>After their ſeparation, Severus's military way accompanies the wall pretty cloſely, and is generally, for the whole ſpace that the walls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo far parted, viſible and diſtinct; yet the way does not follow every ſmaller winding of the wall, upon the tops of the precipices, but generally takes a ſhorter courſe, and paſſes along the ſlope of the hill, from Caſtellum to Caſtellum, in the ſhorteſt and moſt convenient line that it can: this is very remarkable at the firſt great turn of the wall, after it enters upon the precipices. The wall itſelf is almoſt all this way viſible, in an eminent degree, and ſometimes it only wants the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as near Buſy Gap, which is an aperture or paſs between the hills ſo called, where there is an opportunity of croſſing the wall on horſeback. Thus it paſſes by Shewing-ſheels Houſes, leaving Shewing-ſheels Caſtle on the north. Mr Horſley further obſerves, that this Caſtle, or ſomething elſe near it, is called a ſquare Roman Caſtle, in the new edition of Camden; and Camden himſelf thought this was the Station of Hunnum: but he ſays, he ſaw nothing that was Roman about it. The Caſtle itſelf, (in ruins) and the Moats about it, are undoubtedly of a much later date. And he adds, I obſerved ſeveral trenches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, particularly a large and long one, which reaches from Buſy Gap croſs the paſſes between the mountains. But theſe are all on the north ſide of the wall, and muſt certainly have been made in later times, for ſecuring the neighbouring paſſes. Probably they are no older than the times of our famous Moſs Troopers, who might conveniently ſhelter themſelves among theſe hideous mountains and moſſes. The height of one of theſe rocks is near forty yards perpendicular;<note n="*" place="bottom">Warburton, p. 58. Horſley's Brit. Rom</note> but in other parts
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0085300201:100"/>
they are conſiderably higher. As ſuch ſteep rocks are a ſufficient fence of themſelves, the wall has not in theſe parts had either ſtrength or thickneſs, equal to what it has had in others. The remains here are not ſo conſiderable, though it ſeems very improbable that any of the ſtones, eſpecially in ſome places, could have been removed. In the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows between the rocks, beſides the addition of the ditch and a Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum here and there, the wall itſelf ſeems to have been ſtronger and thicker. Where there is a ſmall break of the precipice inward, the wall forms an internal angle, fetching a compaſs. In other caſes, it paſſes directly from one rock to another, and then is uſually continued down the ſide of the one, and up the ſide of the other, except where the deſcent is almoſt perpendicular, in which caſe it is only carried cloſe to the ſide of the rock, beginning again at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>; which was all that was needful or practicable.</p>
               <p>The diſtance between Houſe-ſteads and Carraw-brough is ſomewhat more than four miles and five furlongs. All the Caſtella between theſe two Stations are very viſible, being five in number, but their diſtances are a little unequal. The two firſt intervals from Carraw-brough are juſt ſeven furlongs, but the next is only ſix. There is a turret near Buſy Gap, the diſtance of which from the neareſt Caſtellum is, I find, juſt one-fifth of the interval between that and the next Caſtellum.</p>

                     <p>Mr Warburton, in his Map of Northumberland, gave a drawing of a curious altar and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, being a ſepulchral ſtone, or an altar without any focus at the top, erected to the Dii Manes by Tranquilla Severa, for her and her's. The inſcription is read thus. Dis Manibus dicatum Tranquila Severa, pro ſe et ſuis votum ſolvit Libens Merito. This is depoſited in the Dean and Chapter's Library at Durham. The principal curioſity, in the form or manner of the letters, is the expreſſion of the V and I together, like a Y; though it is only placing the V above the I, as is very evident, both from the original and the draught I have given of it; for in the fourth line there is a viſible diſtance or ſeparation between them, though it is not ſo in the ſecond, which with ſome other ſmall matters has been overlooked in the copies publiſhed before: the letters are ſtrong and well cut, though involved and connected.

                     <p>This is an inſcription of the centurial ſort, that has not been regarded before: it is upon a broken ſtone lying at the door of one of the houſes at Carraw-brough.</p>

               <p>the country through which we had paſſed from Walton to Carraw was dreary, and had not our minds been engaged with objects of antiquity, would have proved weariſome. In ſome parts we had diſtant proſpects, various in their beauties, and rendered more ſtriking by the barrenneſs over which we looked upon them. When we came within five miles of Chollerford, the vales of North and South Tyne opened upon us, and the ſcene was filled with all that pleaſing variety which ariſes from cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation, receiving additional beauties from the incidents of the ſeaſon.

The ground within the Vallum is crowded with the ruins of ſtone buildings, which appear to have ſtood in lineal directions, forming ſtreets, two on the ſouth ſide and two on the north, interſected in the middle by a croſs ſtreet from north to ſouth. On the ſouth ſide without the Vallum and Foſs, many ruins of buildings appear, and ſome on the north. I remember, on a tour in Cumberland, I found Caerleud, near Wigton, crowded with ruins.</p>

Stations defended by a ſtone-built Vallum, were the permanent ones, and winter quarters: the encampments in ſummer were defended by a rampier of turf, with a paliſado, (of which, as I mentioned before, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, the <hi>Corona Vallaris</hi> was a pattern, compoſed of pointed ſtakes) and an outward ditch. Few, if any remains are left us of ſuch, to aſcertain their ſituation or magnitude. In a ſquare of 170 paces by 130, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears room ſufficient for a <hi>Cohort,</hi> when lodged in tents or hovels of wood: but when in that ſquare, you have allotted room for the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> with the apartments of the chief officers, what kind of tenements of maſon-work muſt there be erected in ſtreets, which ſhould contain that number of people, with their accoutrements, wives, families, and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſtuff?—I ſhould conceive, the excellent diſcipline of the Roman army would not admit the women within the wall of the camp, except only in time of imminent peril; but that they were lodged in the ſuburbs.— The enquiry naturally brings on this reſult, that thoſe edifices whoſe remains now appear in ſome of the Roman Stations, (for they are not in all) are of more modern date, were built (after the Romans forſook this iſland) by the Britons, or their Saxon allies, and aroſe in that Aera in which the appellation of <hi>Caer</hi> or City was given to many of them. The Britons, in their diſpirited ſituation on the final retreat of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, would neceſſarily reſort to thoſe barriers and ſtrongholds, which the Romans had filled. I am induced to believe, that no caſtle of any conſiderable magnitude was erected by the Romans in this country: the <hi>Caſtellum</hi> or Turret on the walls, was not worthy the appellation of Caſtle; being, as I before obſerved, moſt probably no more than a tower to guard the gate; or no better than a mere baſtion to command the Vallum. Our caſtles, of which ſuch noble remains appear at this day, are of much more modern date, and derived from the Saxon and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man viſiters. The ſtrongeſt fortifications of the ancient Britons, were formed of piles of looſe ſtones, heaped to a ridge, and reduced into a circle, or a ſquare. Such a <hi>Vallum</hi> was difficult to be ſurmounted by aſſailants. The <hi>Vallum</hi> of the Roman permanent Station, was built of hewn ſtone, inſide and out: thoſe which I have ſeen moſt perfect (among which Lancheſter, in the county of Durham, is one) were formed of ſtones about 16 inches long, and 10 inches deep, of rough aſhler-work: the outſide of the wall was perpendicular, and might, in its original ſtrength, be 14 or 15 feet high, and eight feet thick at the foot, but thining or decreaſing on the inſide towards the top, by ſteps and grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at the diſtance of about 16 inches, and the ſummit covered with a broad flat cape, having a parapet or paliſado in front. Lancheſter has
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0085300201:109"/>
four of thoſe ſteps or gradations now remaining. The interſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the inward and outward caſing of aſhler-work, was filled with flat ſtones, in an inclining poſition, run full of lime mixed with ſmall pebbles and rough gravel; ſo that the cement is more impenetrable than the ſtone itſelf: the angles were obtuſe, to ſuit the ſuperſtructure of an exploratory turret; or to give greater power to the garriſon, upon an aſſault in annoying the enemy on their flanks. The gradations allowed them not only a power of aſcending the wall readily, but of lining it ſeveral ranks deep; thoſe at the top were at liberty to manage their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral weapons and engines; thoſe below to uſe the bow; and the ſoldiers engaged during an aſſault, were eaſily relieved when fatigued or wounded.</p>
               <p>Some of the Stations had an entrance on each ſide, defended by a gate; but whether with a tower or not, it is difficult to aſcertain, tho' it may reaſonably be conjectured.</p>
               <p>I apprehend a Roman Station in Britain, when in the occupation of its proper people, would greatly reſemble the following imaginary drawing.</p>

               <p>From this Station, a military way <note n="*" place="bottom">Horſley's Brit. Rom. 144. Warburton's Val. Rom. 51.</note> has gone directly weſt, by <hi>Little Cheſters</hi> to <hi>Carr-Voran;</hi> it is very viſible for the greateſt part of the way, and paved with large ſtones. In its eaſtern courſe, it ſeems to have paſſed through this Station, and croſſed the river North Tyne, juſt below it, by a bridge; and at the diſtance of three miles and a half from thence, falls in with the great Ermin-ſtreet way, (by the country people called Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſtreet) in its courſe between the ſouth and north parts of Britain; which military way croſſes, and ſoon after coincides with another Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man way, called the Devil's Cauſeway, which enters into Scotland near to Berwick upon Tweed. Mr Warburton ſays, in his opinion this is (though contrary to the ſentiments both of Mr Horſley and Mr Gordon) the true courſe of the Roman road, called the Maiden Way; which they ſuppoſed to have terminated at <hi>Carr-Voran,</hi> or to have entered Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by a ſhorter direction.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Walwick Cheſters</hi> to the village of <hi>Walwick,</hi> Severus's wall and ditch are very obſervable; but Hadrian's Vallum, with what belongs to it, is more obſcure. From hence, all the way to <hi>Carraw-brough,</hi> both the walls and their ditches are very conſpicuous; and for moſt part of the way, ſeveral regular courſes of the original facing ſtone, are to be ſeen in Severus's wall: the two works keep pretty cloſe together, and nearly parallel one to the other: the military way is within a chain or two of the wall. Taking all the works together, they are no where in the whole tract, more conſpicuous and magnificent than they are here, at leaſt for ſo long a ſpace.</p>
               <p>Near <hi>Towertay,</hi> there are five or ſix regular courſes of the facing ſtones of the wall: and a little weſt from thence, are large remains of a Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellum, detached about a yard from the wall, the reaſon of which is not very obvious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0085300201:111"/>There are, for a ſmall ſpace, heaps of rubbiſh laying on the north ſide of Hadrian's ditch, at a place where the ditch paſſes through ſome rocks; which looks as if ſtones had been wrought there for the uſe of the wall. There are alſo in this part of the north Agger, ſeveral breaks, as if they had been made for the paſſage of carriages; which I alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in other parts: none ſuch are obſervable in thoſe places where the military ways are united. And both the rubbiſh upon the north Agger, and the breaches in it, are where Severus's military way leaves it, to go off to a Caſtellum.</p>
               <p>The diſtance between <hi>Walwick Cheſters</hi> and <hi>Carraw-brough Fort,</hi> is almoſt three meaſured miles and a quarter; and in this ſpace there are three viſible Caſtella.

deſcribed by Mr Wallis,
<figure/>
as an altar, with a female Deity, ſuppoſed by him to be Cybele; adjoining to which is the figure of a Lion, raiſing the head of a man who lays proſtrate — the drawing is taken with accuracy. This, with the others at the Grange, appear to be merely monumental; and we were informed they were found to the eaſt of the camp, not far diſtant from the Vallum. The ſculpture, I apprehend, was dedicated to the manes of ſome deceaſed perſonage of note. The lion is boldly relieved; his left foot is placed upon the head of a human figure, naked to the waiſt, the hands caſt forward in the poſition of one fallen. Separated from theſe, by a moulding, on the left hand of the ſtone, is a human figure robed to the feet, a ſpear reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the left arm, a ſmall altar at the right knee, and in the right hand what ſeems to be a blazing torch. The conſtruction I put upon the whole, when I ſaw it, (though contrary to the conjectures of others) is, that it was erected to the memory of one who was ſlain in battle, and that the figure to the left was in the act of incenſing and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rites and honours of the dead. The Romans on their monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments expreſſed particular nations or people by ſome animal; ſo the lion may denote ſome noble enemy. Scotch expeditions are by ſome authors ſaid to be diſtinguiſhed by the figure of a boar.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr Horſley repreſents this monument ſomewhat different; he makes the Lion turning his face from the perſon on whoſe head he reſts his foot, and the ſtanding figure holds a key in his hand.—He gives the following thoughts upon it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>This is but a coarſe, though I think a curious ſculpture, which has never, as I know of, been publiſhed before. I firſt imagined it to have been ſepulchral, as moſt of the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions and ſculptures are, which belong to this place. But if it be the mother of the Gods, who is here repreſented, or any other principal Deity, the ſtone has probably been of a more public nature. There is a broken ſtone with an imperfect ſculpture upon it at Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, which I take to be of the ſame nature. The ſculpture before us, repreſents a female ſeated, holding a key in her right hand, and I think a thyrſus or haſta in her left; and on the other part of the ſtone, a human figure lying along, and a lion with one of his paws gently raiſing up the head. The lion reſpects Cybele, the mother Goddeſs, and the thyrſus and haſta are her common ſymbols, and ſometimes the key. And I am of opinion, that this is the figure of Cybele, the Syrian Goddeſs; for as Montfaucon obſerves, <hi>Dea Syria was one of the moſt celebrated names of Cybele; and ſhe was ſo called, becauſe much or chiefly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in Syria. The ſymbols were the ſame, a towered head, Lions, a Tympanum, Thyrſus, &amp;c.</hi> This ſculpture then may very probably repreſent Cybele, for both the key and the thyrſus were her ſymbols, by one of which was repreſented the opening of the earth, and by the other the producing of wine. And as we have an altar at Little Cheſters devoted to her, this may ſtill render it more probable: and if it be Cybele who is here repreſented, the lion that is gently raiſing up the head of the human figure, may ſignify the revival of man, by the ſpring and produce of the earth, or by the wine and fruits it affords: the lion does not ſeem to be in a devouring poſture, but rather guarding or cheriſhing. In the ſculpture at Corbridge, the reviving figure has not been human, but ſome other animal; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the earth reſtores and cheriſhes both man and beaſt.</q>

                  </note> In the wall of the ſame barn in which the laſt deſcribed ſculpture is now placed, is a monumental inſcription, to which we could not pay ſo much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it required, to make it out, it being grown full of moſs, and

I once ſuſpected that it might be Laus Suavis: the original favours the other reading, but I rather incline to Mr Ward's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it is to be read Logus Suavis, both which names occur ſeveral times in Gruter. When the Doctor copied this, it was with the others in the face of the wall.</p>

At the conflux of the rivers lays the ſweet retirement of NETHER-WARDEN, defended from the north-weſt by lofty eminences, and facing the vale towards the eaſt, hallowed to the churchmen, as being the retirement of St John of Beverley, a Biſhop of Hexham, in ſo diſtant an age as 685.—A little further, and oppoſite to Hexham, on an eminence, ſtands the church of ST JOHN LEE; beneath whoſe ſcite, the banks for near a mile, are laid out in agreeable walks, formed in a happy taſte, appertaining to the manſion of the Jurin family; a modern building, ſeated at the foot of the deſcent, and fronting towards Hexham; having a rich lawn of meads between it and the river.

               <p>In the reign of Egfrid King of Northumberland, A. D. 674, it was made an Epiſcopal See by St Wilfrid, then Archbiſhop of York, who through the enthuſiaſtic fervour of Etheldrida,<note n="*" place="bottom">Etheldrida was daughter to Anna King of the Eaſt Angles, and was firſt married to Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beret, a Grandee in her father's court, with whom ſhe lived a virgin three years. She lived with Egfrid 12 years, ſtill preſerving her virginity. By unceaſing importunities, ſhe prevailed with the King to permit her to retire to a nunnery. She received the veil from Finam Biſhop of Lindisfern, in the abbey of Coldingham, then under the government of Ebba, the King's aunt. Bede, L. 4. Rich. Hagul. c. 1.

The church was raiſed by workmen brought from Italy, and by Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of that time, ſaid to exceed in beauty and elegance every other edifice in the land.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>On Chad's retiring, Wilfrid became ſole Biſhop of Northumberland; that is, of all King Oſway's dominions, which extended from the Humber to the Firth of Forth; and had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the conqueſt he had lately made of Lincolnſhire, which was then part of the Mercian dominions, on the ſouth of Humber. Beſides this vaſt dioceſe, Wilfrid had the government of nine abbies: and being ever ready to accept, and alſo to ſolicit, the moſt extravagant dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which the ignorant ſuperſtition of the age prompted the great ones to beſtow, he built and adorned in the moſt ſumptuous manner his churches and abbies, employing in thoſe works, the moſt ſkilful artiſts he could procure from France and Italy. His magnificence in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects was in no wiſe inferior, for in his family the ſons of many of the Northumbrian Nobles reſided for their education, his attendants were numerous, his furniture ſplendid, and at his table, he is ſaid to have been ſerved in gold. Bede, L. 4. R. Hagulſt. c. 3. Edd. c. 21.</p>
                     <p>His principal works were the reparation of the cathedral of York, the roof of which he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with lead, and glazed its windows. A D. 670, and the building of the two magnificent churches of Ripon and Hexham. Eddius deſcribes him, as attended in his progreſſes, when performing his epiſcopal functions, not only by his fingers, of whom Eddius himſelf was one, but by maſons and artiſts of almoſt every kind. Ed c. 14. Wilfrid's adverſity was derived from an averſion the King took againſt him, apprehending the Biſhop had influenced the Queen to turn Nun. Which averſion was not a little increaſed by the Biſhop's immoderate wealth and ambition. Bede. L. 4. He died at his monaſtry of Oundle, in Northamptonſhire, and was buried in the church of St Peter, at Ripon. Bede gives his Epitaph, as follows:

               <p>Eata ſoon afterwards being tranſlated to Lindisfarn, was ſucceeded at Hexham by Tumbert, A. D. 680. This Biſhop was depoſed, by a Council held at Twiford, near the river Alne, A. D. 684; at which King Egfrid was preſent, with Theodore Archbiſhop of Canterbury, at whoſe inſtance this Convocation was held, for the intent of examining Tumbert's denial of his juriſdiction, as Provincial, over the churches.</p>
               <p>St Cuthbert, a Monk of Lindisfarn, then an Anchorite on Farn Iſland, was elected to Hexham, and with great reluctance received the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy: he was tranſlated to Lindisfarn, and Eata returned to Hexham.</p>

                     <p>Miracles were not the leaſt of the merits for canonization. St John of Beverley was of noble birth, and a man of great learning. Venerable Bede was educated by him, and Bede admits he received his order of prieſthood from him. <q>Now though John Baptiſt did none, yet John of Beverley is ſaid to have done many miracles. By making the ſign of the croſs on a dumb youth, with a ſcalled head, not only reſtored to ſpeech and a head of hair, but eloquent diſcourſe and brave curled locks. Some years before his death he quitted his arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick, and retired to his monaſtry at Beverley, where he died: and which afterwards King Athelſtan made (I will not call it a ſanctuary becauſe unhallowed by the largeneſs of the liberties allowed thereunto) but a place of refuge for murderers and malefactors So that the <hi>freed Stool</hi> in Beverley became the ſeat of the ſcornful; and ſuch heinous offenders as could recover the ſame, did therein ſecurely defy all legal proſecution againſt them.</q>

He was famous for working miracles, both living and dead. Malmſbury, Weſtminiſter, and Higded report one very ſtrange thing, which continued to their time, and was ſhewn as it were for a ſight. They tell us that the people of the place uſed to bring bulls, the wildeſt and fierceſt they could meet with; theſe unmanageable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they uſed to bring hampered with cords, with ſeveral ſtrong men to drag them along; who as ſoon as they entered the church yard in Beverley, dropped their fierce and formidable nature, and were as came as if they had been metamorphoſed into ſheep. And the people were ſo well aſſured of their inoffenſiveneſs, that they uſed to turn them looſe, and play with them.</q>

               <p>The tenants within this manor, as ſubjects of a Palatinate, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from all other public ſubſidies than thoſe raiſed by their Palatine.</p>

of Henry VIII. retaining nothing but the ſpecial juriſdiction. In the 14th year of Queen Elizabeth, it was annexed to the county of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland; and the manor being ſoon after ſold, devolved on the late Sir Walter Calverly Blackett.</p>
               <p>The remains of this ancient cathedral bear innumerable marks of magnificence. Many ancient tombs are here: within the quire is the recumbent effigy of an Eccleſiaſtic hooded, on a table monument of black marble, in relief; at the foot, a ſhield with uncommon arms, or rather an emblematical device to denote mortality, being the reſemblance of croſs bones. The people who keep the doors, ſay it is the tomb of Prior Richard, an Hiſtorian of the 12th century. He was ſome time a Monk here, and occurs Prior A. D. 1153. The device on the ſhield, if it is preſumed to be the tomb of Richard, will then appear to be the letters <hi>ri</hi> placed one over the other. Mr Wallis's Antiquities, which I have frequent occaſion to quote, ſays <q>theſe arms are argent, a ſaltier gules; and that contiguous to this tomb, an helmet is fixed, denoting that this perſonage, before he was an Eccleſiaſtic, was of ſome mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary order.</q> He alſo ſuppoſes he was Prior here.—If it were not for the ample field of imagination, and inexhauſtable conjectures, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Antiquaries would be dull indeed—I cannot forbear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from this learned viſiter. Immediately adjoining this tomb, ſtands a ſhrine <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0085300201:130"/>A little below, in the ſame aile, is the tomb of Sir Robert Ogle, with the arms of Bertram and Ogles, quartered, and an inſcription in braſs, dated 1404. Theſe were ancient families in Northumberland; the Ogles owned ſeven Lords and thirty Knights of their race, having large poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions before the conqueſt.</p>
               <p>In the north aile is a monument in the wall, of ſuch a form as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſigned at the building of churches, for founders or great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; but to what perſonage this belongs, is not known, no inſignia or inſcription remaining. It is ſuppoſed to be the tomb of Alfwold, King of Northumberland, who was aſſaſſinated at Cilcheſter, by Sigga, a factious Lord of his Court, on the 23d of September, A. D. 788. I meaſured an effigy which lays near this tomb, and found it anſwering exactly in length. The tomb is formed in an aperture made through the wall by an elegant piece of arched work. The effigy repreſents an Eccleſiaſtic with his hood thrown back to his forehead, his hands ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and robed to the feet; the folds of the drapery thrown into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order, eaſy and elegant.</p>
               <p>On the ſcreen at the entrance of the quire, are ſome ſtrange monaſtic paintings, vulgarly ſtiled <hi>Death's Dance;</hi> a ludicrous repreſentation of the univerſal influence of that inſatiable tyrant, over all ranks of men; beginning with the full-cheſted Cardinal, and triply coronated Pope, and leading into his mazes the Prince and Peaſant: but I am ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with the church paintings I have ſeen in other places, that I had not patience to attend to this defilement of the tabernacle. There are ſome grim and lion-like Saints painted in the ailes, among whom ſtands St John of Beverley, of hideous aſpect.</p>
               <p>In the pavement of the croſs aile are ſeveral monuments; one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>"Hic Jacet Thomas de Devilſton,"</hi> and ornamented with a croſier; another with a croſier and chalice, inſcribed <hi>"Johannes Dew,"</hi> with the uſual legendary prayer in the margin, <hi>Orate per anima,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In a part behind the north door, is the recumbent effigy of a Knight, which Mr Wallis ſays repreſents Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerſet, taken priſoner and beheaded at Hexham by King Edward the Fourth; his ſhield <hi>Or,</hi> bearing a <hi>feſſe az,</hi> with <hi>three garbs proper.</hi> I think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable this monument was erected for a traitor, who died an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0085300201:131"/>
death: beſides, it cannot be any of the Beaufort family, as they quartered the arms of England. I rather conceive this was one of the Aydens of Ayden Caſtle, the arms aſſumed by the Edens of the North at this day, being greatly ſimilar. The male line of the family of Aydens of Ayden Caſtle, was extinct in Edward the Firſt's time; and Emma the heireſs and relict of that family, was by him, as a royal ward, given in marriage to Wallis.</p>
               <p>The interior architecture of this church, is highly finiſhed, in the mixed Gothic order; the pillars are cluſtered, ſupporting Gothic arches; the members of the archings, and the pilaſters, finely proportioned. The quire is roofed with wood covered with lead, and the ſide ailes are arched with ſtone; a double gallery runs round the whole, opening with Saxon arches; each opening is compoſed of three arches, the centre circular, the ſide ones pointed, of which the workmanſhip is very fine, and the pillars light. The principal pillars of this ſtructure in general are rather diſproportionate and heavy; an error ſeen in moſt of the Saxon churches.</p>
               <p>The Mercers Company in London, under the will of Richard Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> about the year 1630, founded a Lectureſhip here, which they endowed by a purchaſe of tithes. Sir Walter Calverly Blackett gave ſeveral valuable gifts for the augmentation of the living; and many charities have been left for the relief of the poor. It is a doubt with me, whether theſe donations to the poor do not induce indigent and impotent perſons to crowd a town, and in effect encourage idleneſs. Had the donors diſpoſed the ſame ſums for inſtituting and ſupporting a manufactory, the encouragement to induſtry would have brought with it opulence, inſtead of crowds of mendicants.</p>
               <p>Mr Gale and Dr Stukeley, in the year 1726, viſited the vaults of this church, now uſed as a private burial-place. What will not Curioſity attempt! They have given two inſcriptions diſcovered there; the one containing a new name of a <hi>Legatus Auguſti,</hi> viz. <hi>Q. Calpurnius conceſſinius,</hi> and that of a body of horſe at Corcheſter, called <hi>Equites Caeſarienſes</hi> or <hi>Caeſariani Coronotatae,</hi> not mentioned either in the <hi>Notitia Imperii</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The other of <hi>Lucius Septimus Severus,</hi> by them ſaid to be of the beſt ſculpture, the letters large, but the inſcription imperfect. The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity remarked by theſe Antiquaries, conſiſts in this monument having
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0085300201:132"/>
ſo diſtinctly the name of that Emperor, and its being the only genuine one found ſo near the wall with his name on it.</p>
               <p>Mr Horſley gives the firſt of theſe inſcriptions in the following manner:
<q>
                     <l>LEG. A—</l>

               <p>To this reading he adds the following remarks:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Rev. Mr Andrews of Hexham, obliged a friend of mine with a copy of the ſame inſcriptions, which he had taken. This inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is upon a Roman altar: I had leave to deſcend into the vault and view the inſcriptions. I ſpent ſome time in examining every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and have here repreſented them as I found them, with the greateſt impartiality. Every word and letter that remains in this, is ſo plain as to leave no room for any doubt. The not taking notice that the altar and inſcription are both of them imperfect at the top, is the only material defect in the former repreſentation. I look upon it as certain, that the letters which have filled up the deficient part of the line, have been VG. PR. PR. for thus the number of letters in this line will anſwer to the number in the others. I think alſo there have been two or three lines above, which are broken off: theſe have probably contained the name of the Legate, and of the God to whom the altar had been inſcribed. The conjectures in the letters in Mr Gordon's appendix are very ingenious, and the arguments uſed in ſupport of them, very learned and curious. The author ſuppoſes, that here is the name of a new Legate, as alſo of a new body of horſe, called <hi>Equites Caeſarienſes</hi> (or <hi>Caeſariani) Corionototae:</hi> the name <hi>Equites
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0085300201:133"/>
Caeſarienſes,</hi> is there juſtified by a parallel inſtance in Gruter; and the name <hi>Corionototae,</hi> that gentleman ſuppoſes to be a corruption of the Roman name of a people in theſe parts, perhaps <hi>Curia</hi> or <hi>Coria Otodinor,</hi> and that Corbridge was the place. The reſt of the inſcription he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly explains to be a flattering acknowledgment of this perſon, that he was promoted by the immediate hand of the Emperor; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no new thing to call the Emperors Gods, and erect altars to them. But in a matter ſo entirely conjectural, it is very excuſable to ſuſpend one's aſſent; and the more explanations are offered, it is the more probable that the truth will be found out. If <hi>Q. Calpurnius Conceſſinius</hi> was the Imperial Legate, I ſcarce think that he would in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription ſtile himſelf <hi>Praefect of Horſe:</hi> I rather believe, as I hinted before, that the name of the Legate has been above, and is broken off. Perhaps it has been <hi>ſub Legato Auguſtali,</hi> or <hi>pro ſaluti Legati Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtalis.</hi> As to the word <hi>Corionototarum,</hi>

                           <q>As to your inſcription from Hexham, it is evident the artificer has been very unſucceſsful, and that his chiſel has ſtammered into more ſyllabus than were neceſſary in the word Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nototarum. I humbly think it ought to have been Coriatarum, and that the people of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter were called Coriatae, as the Spartans of old were called Spartiatae, or Spartietas, much uſed by Herodotus.</q>
                        </p>
                     </note> I rather ſuppoſe that Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy's <hi>Coria</hi> or <hi>Curia,</hi> was a town of the <hi>Gadeni,</hi> than of the <hi>Otadini.</hi> Ptolemy's <hi>Coritani,</hi> are a people of one of the <hi>Provinciae Caeſarienſes</hi> in Britain, and poſſibly, from hence theſe horſe might have the name of <hi>Caeſarienſes Coritani. Coriotiotar</hi> in the anonymous <hi>Ravenuas,</hi> is not unlike this name. I ſuppoſe it may have been miſtaken by ſome tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber for <hi>Coriotiotae</hi> or <hi>Corionototae;</hi> the ſhape of the Gothic <hi>E</hi> is not unfavourale to this: but it ſeems more probable to me, that it was from ſome more diſtant country, than any part of Britain, that theſe troops had the name of <hi>Caeſarienſes Corionototae</hi> or <hi>Caeſarienſes Corionoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum.</hi> The <hi>Crotoniatae</hi> (inhabitants of <hi>Croton,</hi> a city in Greece) are celebrated by <hi>Strabo;</hi> according to whom, 'the laſt of theſe was equal to the firſt of the other Greeks.' Poſſibly this name may have been deſigned for <hi>Crotoniatarum:</hi> if this be admitted, we may more eaſily account for the Greek inſcriptions at Corbridge and Lancheſter, and for the more evidences of Grecian Auxiliaries, that appear in the neighbourhood. The explication of the reſt of the inſcription by the ſame learned gentleman, whom I mentioned above, is certainly juſt; that <hi>Praeſentiſſimum Numen dei</hi> ſignifies the Emperor, and <hi>manu</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that <hi>Q.

               <p>Our curioſity urged us, at the diſtance of 49 years after thoſe learned viſiters had inſpected the vaults, to ſee the antiquities they mention: perhaps they had entered into open cells, then unuſed for ſepulture: our deſcent was more ſolemn. Theſe vaults have for ſeveral years paſt been uſed as a private burial-place, and the entrance is covered with a table of marble, of prodigious ſize, which is not uſually moved but at the denunciation of mortality. The maſſive <hi>Clauſtrum</hi> was heaved from the mouth of the vault by iron crows and rollers, at which the ground trembled over the arches—by a ladder we deſcended about 20 feet, into the regions of the dead, where avaricious curioſity making an anxious reſearch after the objects of its deſire, ſo compleatly occupied the mind, that ſcarce one reflection was agitated, for thoſe, over whoſe aſhes we wantonly trampled. Theſe vaults, which anciently were within the weſt end of the croſs, have been built of the ſtones of a Roman ſtation, many cornices, mouldings, and ornaments, with fragments of inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are ſcattered through the walls. We found the preceding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription correſpond exactly with the plate in Mr Horſley's works. The narrow vault, on the left hand, is roofed over with flat ſtones, on the furtheſt of which the following inſcription is preſerved, but from its ſituation, and the ſtone being reverſed, rendered difficult to be read. My companion and I took it with great attention, both in the letters as reverſed, and (as well as we could ſee them) direct. Our copies exactly correſponded with each other, and yet they differ from Mr Horſley's, in whoſe plates it is thus repreſented:

               <p>To this reading he adds, <q>There can be no great doubt, with relation to the former part of it, which is not unlike the inſcription at Burgh, in Richmondſhire; a copy of which was long ago publiſhed by Mr Camden, and runs thus: Imperatori Caeſari Marco Antonino Pio Aurelio Felici Auguſto, &amp;c. Then follows a ſpace where the name of Geta has been eraſed. Juſt ſo in this inſcription at Hexham; after much the ſame names and titles given to Severus and Caracalla, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a ſmall ſpace, where it is manifeſt the words have been deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly eraſed with a tool. I ſuppoſe the Vexillatio Legionis was made up of the ſeveral Vexillations of the particular Cohorts: and perhaps they might retain the name of Vexillationes Cohortium, when the Vexillations of all the Cohorts of the Legion, that is, the whole Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illation of the Legion itſelf was not preſent. Theſe then might be the Vexillations of ſome Cohorts of one of the Legions which were employed in building the wall, that might be occaſionally at Hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and erect this inſcription. Some of the inſcription, facing the right hand, is covered in the wall, on which the inſcribed ſtone reſts. The lower part of the ſtone is alſo fixed in the end wall of one of the paſſages into the vault; but not ſo as to hinder the loweſt line from being read, though not without difficulty. The letters FE—RVNT are diſtinct and certain, and as much room is between the E and R, as will contain CE: ſo that beyond all queſtion it has been fecerunt, which compleats the inſcription.

               <p>Before I quit the ſubject of theſe inſcriptions, I muſt add, that Mr Horſley ſays <q>theſe ſtones and inſcriptions argue Hexham to have been a Roman Station; for the plenty of free ſtone ſo near, makes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that in the modern buildings (or thoſe later than Roman) they would have fetched any ſtones either from the Roman Wall or from Corbridge. And this might have been a town in the Roman times, and yet not be mentioned in the Itinerary, nor continue ſo late as

               <p>At the weſt end of the church are the remains of the priory. It was a ſpacious building, with an adjoining cloiſter. The refectory is yet entire, and ſerves as a room of entertainment at public times; is very ſpacious, with a roof of oak work. What remains of the cloiſters, ſhews they were of excellent workmanſhip: the tabernacle work and pilaſters above the ſeats are elegant: the door caſe oppoſite, which formerly was an entrance into the church, is richly wrought with pierced work of fruit and foliage, in a ſtile eaſy and bold.</p>
               <p>The town of Hexham was burnt by the Scots in the year 1296, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the priory, the weſt end of the church, and ſchool-houſe.</p>
               <p>It was pillaged by David King of Scots, in the 20th year of the reign of King Edward III. A. D. 1346, who entered the borders with 40,000 men, making their way by Lanercoſt Priory and Nawarth Caſtle, in Cumberland; on which incurſion they were over thrown at Nevil's Croſs, near Durham, and David was taken priſoner.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>This place is not very populous, the inhabitants being computed at 2000 ſouls: the ſtreets are narrow, and ill built. The Market-place, near the centre of the town, is a ſpacious ſquare; in which is a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient piazza for the butcher-meat, the ſtalls being moveable. The town is ſupplied by a fluent fountain of water, in the Market-place. Two markets are held here in the week, on Thurſday and Saturday; and there are two annual fairs.</p>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0085300201:138"/>Leading to the priory, is a gate-way of very ancient architecture; the arches form a ſemicircle, and are moulded in a ſtile which denotes their antiquity to be much greater than any part of the priory or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral. There is nothing ſimilar to this work, in proportion of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, about the church, or any thing in Hexham I could diſcover that appeared cotemporary. The roof of the gate-way is of ribbed arching, meeting in the centre; the interſtices, filled with thin ſtones or bricks, ſuch as are ſeen in Roman works. The paſſage is divided into a large gate-way for horſemen or carriages, and a narrow one for foot paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. The ſuperſtructure is in ruins. Mr Pennant ſays this gate <q>is of the old Saxon architecture, and perhaps part of the labours of the great Wilfrid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There are two ancient towers in the town, the one uſed as a Court or Seſſions-houſe, anciently an exploratory tower, belonging to the Biſhops and Priors of Hexham; the other ſituated on the top of the hill towards the Tyne, of remarkable architecture; being ſquare, containing very ſmall apertures to admit the light, and having a courſe of corbels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting a long way from the top, which ſeem to have ſupported a hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gallery, and beſpeak the tower, at preſent, not near its original height. The founders of theſe places are not known. Camden ſays "he heard they appertained to the Archbiſhop of York." This laſt-mentioned tower, having two dreadful dungeons within it, doubtleſs has been the chief fortreſs of the place, and was uſed as a priſon when the Biſhops of Hexham poſſeſſed their palatine juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>In one of the chambers remaining in this tower, is the inſcription on the plate. Mr Bailey, who was my companion, was informed of it on a late viſit to Hexham, and did me the favour to communicate it. He deſcribes it as cut with a knife on the oak lintle of the chimney, which remains rough and uneven. The room is of a conſiderable ſize, but appears to have had no windows, or any lights but what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived through loop-holes in the walls. The Gaoler now uſes the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a hay-loft. The inſcription ſeems to be the labour of ſome Scotch priſoner, and by the character is of no very diſtant antiquity. By the two letters at the beginning of the inſcription, I apprehend it was done in the reign of one of the James's; and give it the greateſt antiquity, under the Scotch royal line of that name, it will only carry it to the beginning of the 13th century.

Northumberland, General of the forces of the Houſe of York, forced the intrenchments of the Lancaſtrian party, and made a dreadful ſlaughter. The Ogles and Manners' of this country were with the victors; the Percies, Roes, Nevils, Tailbois, and Greys, among the vanquiſhed. The Earl of Somerſet, Sir William Tailbois, Sir Humphrey Nevil, and Sir Ralph Grey, being among the priſoners, were executed; Sir Ralph being firſt degraded, by cutting off his ſpurs, defacing his armorial enſignia, and breaking his ſword over his head.

This Caſtle has a remarkable ſituation, being ſeated on a peninſula formed by the conflux of the Allen and Harſingdale Burn: the approach is narrow, on an elevated way, chiefly formed by nature, rocky ſteeps laying on each ſide, cloathed with wood; beneath which you view a pretty pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque plain, waſhed by the murmuring ſtreams of Allen, where a cottage fortunately diſpoſed amidſt a little grove of trees, gives a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar beauty to the retirement, which is ſhut in on one ſide, by a woody amphitheatre hanging on the weſtern banks, and by the gloomy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Peel on the other.

I fancy, the country people calling that which you ſuſpect to be the <hi>Watling-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Northumberland</hi> by that name, has been the chief motive for your opinion; but I could give you ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of old Ways ſometimes called <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Foſſe Way</hi> by the vulgar, in counties where it is certain thoſe Ways never came; ſo that nothing is to be built upon that.</p>

I. p. 178, where, in an old deed, this very place is named <hi>Enthelbert,</hi> as I believe, from <hi>Enchelberi,</hi> the word <hi>Enchel</hi> in <hi>Welſh</hi> ſignifying an <hi>Arm, brachium,</hi> the very name in Latin and Britiſh thus correſponding. Beſides, I cannot but be of opinion, that <hi>Brementonacis</hi> was at <hi>Overborough,</hi> on the edge of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> it lying in the direct way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Gallacum, Whellop Caſtle,</hi> and <hi>Coccium, Ribblecheſter,</hi> from which latter place it keeps the juſt diſtance allotted it by <hi>Antoninus;</hi> and tho' the copies of that <hi>Itinerary</hi> place it 27 from the former, inſtead of 32 miles; upon a little conſideration, you will find the miſtake might be eaſily occaſioned, by the tranſcribers turning the third X into V. I do not know whether you have ſeen the edition of <hi>Antoninus</hi> publiſhed by me ſome years ago; if you have not, my brother, at <hi>Scruton,</hi> can lend it you; it may, perhaps, be diverting to you, though I muſt own I have, ſince the publication of it, found reaſon to make ſeveral alterations in it, as I have done upon my own book that I have here by me; and among others, I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, that your Map has fully convinced me, that <hi>Glanoventa</hi> and <hi>Gallana,</hi> in the <hi>tenth Itinerary,</hi> are at <hi>Thornton</hi> and <hi>Portgate,</hi> and not where my unacquaintedneſs with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had induced me to place them; but <hi>Alone,</hi> I take to be <hi>Whitley Caſtle,</hi> in <hi>Alondale,</hi> as well from the better agreement of the miles, as from an inſcription there left by the <hi>Cohors Tertia Nerviorum,</hi> which the <hi>Notitia Imperii</hi> quarters at <hi>Alone.</hi> I am pretty much of your mind, that the military way from <hi>Eaſingwould</hi> to <hi>Thirſt,</hi> came from <hi>York</hi> towards <hi>Caturactonium,</hi> or rather into that which went from <hi>Caturactonium</hi> towards <hi>Gatherley Moor,</hi> becauſe I am very much miſtaken, if there is not a military way running along the northern bank of <hi>Swale,</hi> from <hi>Catterick Bridge</hi> eaſtward towards <hi>Bolton.</hi> Now I take the courſe of this road to have gone by <hi>Thornton in the Street</hi> to <hi>Thornbrough,</hi> and by <hi>Romandby,</hi> near <hi>Northallerton,</hi> which I doubt not has been a Roman Station, by the name of it; and you will find great works caſt up about the <hi>Caſtle Hills</hi> there, which are very evidently far larger and beyond the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the modern caſtle. I have alſo been told of a Roman Way ſome where about <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandby,</hi> though I could never well underſtand where it was. To this I ſhall add, that I hardly ever met with a place named <hi>Thornbrough</hi> or <hi>Thornton,</hi> that was not near ſome old Station; ſuch a one you have by <hi>Catterick;</hi> another, called <hi>Thornton</hi> and <hi>Thornaldby,</hi> near <hi>Ethelbury; Thornton,</hi> where <hi>Glanoventa</hi> ſtood, in <hi>Northumberland; Thornbrough,</hi> near <hi>Noſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field Moor,</hi> and juſt by the <hi>Via Vicinalis</hi> that led from <hi>Ethelbury</hi> over that Moor into <hi>Leeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> (part of the <hi>Ermin-ſtreet</hi>) and not far from <hi>Well,</hi> where any of the inhabitants can ſhew

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0085300201:148"/>remains of antiquity, and from thence continues its courſe by <hi>Bolham, Houghton, St Helen's Auckland,</hi> and ſoon after croſſes the Wear to <hi>Bincheſter (Vinovium)</hi> where are to be ſeen the Veſtigia of a Roman Fort, ſeveral broken Altars, in the poſſeſſion of Farrer Wren, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Lord of the Soil, and a great number of Roman Coins dug up there. From this place its courſe is generally over mooriſh grounds to <hi>Langcheſter,</hi> where moſt of thoſe altars and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions in Durham Library were found;<note>See Philoſ.

                           </p>
                           <p>But before I leave <hi>Ebcheſter,</hi> which is inferior to no place I have mentioned for Antiquities, I cannot but acquaint you, that I look upon it to have been the <hi>Vindomora</hi> of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and not <hi>Wall's End,</hi> where that Station hath hitherto been fixed, ſince it exactly anſwers the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances between <hi>Corſtopitum</hi> and <hi>Vinovium,</hi> the ſecond and fourth Stations in the firſt Iter. (viz.) nine miles from the firſt of them, and nineteen from the latter, and this in a direct line along one of the moſt entire regular and large ways I ever ſaw, the ridge being for the moſt part two yards in height, full eight yards broad, and all paved with ſtone, that it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as even as if new laid; whereas from <hi>Corſtopitum</hi> or <hi>Corbridge</hi> to <hi>Wall's End</hi> (the third Station in the firſt Iter) it is twenty miles directly eaſt, and from thence back to <hi>Vinovium,</hi> the fourth Station, twenty-five miles to the weſtward; ſo that we are carried eighteen miles about, along a road that hath no appearance of a military way, except juſt where it touches the <hi>Picts Wall,</hi> and hath the river <hi>Tyne</hi> to paſs in a part where it never could be croſſed without boats, which are difficulties I think the Romans would never ſubject themſelves to.</p>
                           <p>I have your edition of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> which I frequently read, and value beyond any thing of that nature, but cannot yet abſolutely agree with you in placing <hi>Alone</hi> at <hi>Whitley Caſtle;</hi> not but that it appears plainly to have been a Roman Station, from the greatneſs of its ruins, and it having the Roman road called the <hi>Maiden Way</hi> running through its center; and from the inſcription left by the <hi>Cohors Tertia Neeciorum,</hi> that <hi>Mr Camden</hi> gives us, it is not to be doubted that they were quartered thereabouts: but when I conſider that the diſtance which the Itinerary gives betwixt <hi>Gallana, Portgate,</hi> and <hi>Alone,</hi> if at <hi>Whitley Caſtle,</hi> is but twelve miles, and the real diſtance is twenty; and on the other hand, that <hi>Old Town,</hi> in <hi>Alondale,</hi> exactly anſwers the diſtance allotted it by <hi>Antoninus,</hi> hath a port-way ſeven yards broad, all paved with ſtone, ranging between them, its ſituation on an eminence on the very brink of the river <hi>Alon,</hi> and of a ſquare figure intrenched; and if we may give credit to the author of the additions to Camden's Britannia, hath produced ſeveral Roman antiquities, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that Station is to be placed here; beſides, I begin to think myſelf wrong in joining this Roman road, which I am ſpeaking of, with that called the <hi>Maiden Way</hi> at <hi>Whitley Caſtle;</hi> and am partly of opinion, that it did not go ſo far weſt, but rather ſtruck over by the head of the river <hi>Teys</hi> to <hi>Ethelburgh,</hi> in Yorkſhire, and from thence went by <hi>Coccuim</hi> to <hi>Mancunium</hi> and that <hi>Whelp Caſtle</hi> and <hi>Overburrough</hi> (if Roman Stations) are either in the military way that comes from <hi>Ambleſide</hi> towards <hi>Kendale,</hi> which perhaps unites with it at <hi>Coccium (Ribblecheſter)</hi> or on that called the <hi>Maiden Way,</hi> which goes by <hi>Whitley Caſtle.</hi> This opinion is very much ſtrengthened by a new diſcovered military way, of the very ſame dimenſions and work with that on which <hi>Glanoventa</hi> ſtands and <hi>Galana,</hi> and which runs from <hi>Ethelburgh</hi> full north over a moor called <hi>Windgate,</hi> and at a ſmall village called <hi>Crackpot</hi> croſſes the river <hi>Swale,</hi> and ſoon after enters another named <hi>Feetham,</hi> where I muſt leave it at preſent, on account of the ſeaſon. At my parting with it, it ſeemed to point at <hi>Barnard Caſtle,</hi>

I have been very long upon this ſubject, therefore ſhall only add, that the miles I reckon by are ſhorter than thoſe you make your computation from; for as <hi>Antoninus</hi> is my chief guide.

I do not know whether I mentioned the Roman road from <hi>Romanby,</hi> &amp;c. running by <hi>Bolton,</hi> on the north ſide of <hi>Swale,</hi> to you, but I find you have obſerved it. If you have leiſure at any time, when you are at <hi>Northallerton,</hi> to view the <hi>Caſtle Hills</hi> there, between that <hi>town</hi> and <hi>Romanby,</hi> you will find great works and trenches out of the limits, and beyond the ditch of the <hi>modern Caſtle,</hi> weſtward and ſouthward, which I dare ſay were Roman, and gave name to the neighbouring village, though what was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient appellation of it, is now entirely loſt. As for the name of <hi>Allerton,</hi> it is very hard to tell whence it came; the <hi>Saxon Kings</hi> generally built on or near the ruins of ancient and decayed <hi>Roman towns,</hi> and as we have no memorials that contradict my conjecture. I am apt to think this town might be built here by <hi>King Alfred,</hi> who reſtored many places that had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the <hi>Danes;</hi> or elſe by <hi>Guthrum the Dane,</hi> to whom, upon his being baptized, he gave all the kingdom on the north ſide of <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> who might call it <hi>Alvertun</hi> or <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſreton</hi> (for that is the ancienteſt name it occurs by) in honour of his godfather and benefactor: this, I think, is more probable, than that it ſhould be ſo called from <hi>aller trees,</hi> as ſome have fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of your finding the altar at <hi>Cheſter in the Wood,</hi> are very odd; I cannot ſuppoſe that vault to have been the place where the altar was primarily erected and uſed, ſince they only ſacrificed under ground to the <hi>infernal Gods,</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> was not one of them: it ſeems, moſt probably, to have been concealed there by the <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Roman Britons,</hi> when they were drove from thoſe Stations by the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is a very different ſituation from others I have ſeen, choſen by the Religious for the foundation of their houſes; the country around is

barren and mountainous; the narrow vale in which the abbey is placed, ſeems in no-wife ſuited to the maintenance of its former inhabitants— poverty for ages paſt has reigned over the face of the adjacent country. The ſcites of religious houſes are generally in well-ſheltered and warm ſituations, where the retirements are ſurrounded with rich lands. This place looks truly like the realm of mortification.</p>
               <p>This abbey was founded by Walter de Bolbeck in 1175, dedicated to the bleſſed Virgin, for twelve Premonſtratenſian Canons, having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to exceed that number, with the conſent of the Biſhop of Durham. Part of his donation was twelve fiſhes for their table, out of his fiſhery of Stiford, in lieu of tithes of fiſh. The Abbot was ſummoned to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament 23 King Edward I. At the ſuppreſſion, here were fourteen Canons; the annual revenue of the houſe, according to Dugdale, being 40l. 0s. 9d. and 44l. 9s. 1d. according to Speed. After paſſing from the Crown by ſale, it became the poſſeſſion of the Foſters, and was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited in 1715, by Thomas Forſter, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> after which it was purchaſed by Lord Crew, and by him left to charitable uſes.</p>
               <p>The weſt end and tower of the church and the ſouth aile of the croſs remain; the latter neatly fitted up for parochial duty. The gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way entering into the ſquare, where formerly the houſes of the Canons ſtood, ſtill remains; the towers on each hand converted into ale-houſes: the buildings which are ſtanding are now inhabited by poor people, who are perhaps employed in the leadworks; the diſtreſs and ragged appearance of the whole conventual buildings, being moſt deplorable; no one relique of church pomp remaining. To compenſate for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable review of cells of poverty, we walked in the levels adjoining the church, when it happened to be the time of divine ſervice: the pſalm of the congregation, at our diſtance, had a degree of ſolemn har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which inſpired ſerious though pleaſing reflections: ſentiments and ideas ſucceeded, which dignify the mind of man, and give him competition with angels.</p>

               <p>The Caſtle of Prudhoe ſtands on the ſummit of a vaſt rocky promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, which communicates with the adjoining grounds by a narrow neck and paſs towards the ſouth; the ground on which the fortreſs ſtands forming ſeven parts of a circle, on an octagonal ſection. It is guarded by an outward wall towards the Tyne, built on the brink of the cliffs, in this part not leſs than ſixty perpendicular feet in height, above the plain which intervenes between the caſtle and the river; this wall at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals is defended by ſquare baſtions. The entrance to the caſtle is from the ſouth: on our approach the whole ſtructure was viewed from the heights, and made a very noble and formidable appearance. The nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row neck of land leading to the entrance, was formerly cut through by
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0085300201:155"/>
a deep ditch, over which a draw bridge has given acceſs to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gate: the water which anciently ſupplied the ditch, is now col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by a reſervoir before the gate, and ſerves a mill: the outward gate was originally defended by ſeveral outworks and a tower, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their ruins. From the ſituation in which I drew my view of this place, I could overlook the top of the firſt gate, and the eye pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the inner gate-way, the ſuperſtructure of which is a lofty em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battled ſquare tower, about ſixty feet high, now ſo mantled with ivy, that the windows, loop-holes, and apertures are almoſt wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. I will deſcribe the whole from the ſtation I occupied on that occaſion: To the right, the outward wall extended to ſome diſtance, terminated by a turret or exploratory mount, the wall of which is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battled, and there the landſkip was cloſed by a fine grove of ſtately trees. The outward wall to the left, from the inner gate-way, extends to a conſiderable diſtance, without any turret or baſtion; over which ſeveral interior buildings, and among them the remains of the chapel, were diſcovered, in all the confuſion of ruin; mingled chimneys, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, buttreſſes, columns, and walls, in that wildneſs of irregularity, which conſtitutes much pictureſque beauty in ſcenes of this kind: above all which objects a ſquare tower, the Keep of the Fortreſs, (on the ſide towards me almoſt perfect, twenty-five yards in height, and eighteen in breadth, but without ornament or windows, with an exploratory tower on the ſouth-weſt corner) overlooked the caſtle, with that gloomy and ſullen majeſty which characterizes the age in which it had its riſe. The wall ſtill extending to the left, on its angle is defended by a ſquare baſtion, with broken loop-holes; from whence it turns northward, and is terminated by a broken circular tower, ſituate on the brink of the cliff, whoſe inner receſs the eye ſufficiently penetrated, to mark the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of its interior works.

This gate gives admittance to a covered way, leading to the inner gate, about 30 paces in length; a ſally-port opening on each ſide, to flank the walls and defend the

A lattice or open gate ſtill remains, jointed with ſtuds of iron. The roof of the gate-way is arched in ſemicircles, with an aperture in the centre, from whence thoſe in the upper chamber might annoy an enemy who had forced the gate. From thence you enter an area, now ſo blocked up by the buildings of a farm-yard and tenement, that it is not poſſible to form any idea of its original magnitude; though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the other parts, that an open area had ſurrounded the great tower, which doth not ſhew any remains of communication with the outworks, but ſeems to have ſtood apart, on an eminence in the centre. The outward wall was defended on the angle to the ſouth weſt by a large ſquare baſtion, with loop-holes; to the north-weſt, by a circular tower, containing ſeveral tiers of low chambers, ſingular in their form and height, and ſuch as I never obſerved before in any ancient caſtle: the inhabitants could not ſtand erect in them at the time of defence.

The large tower is in ruins, only the the ſouthern wall now ſtanding; and not one baſtion remains entire, they being all in ruins towards the area.

                     </p>
                     <p>In the 14th of King John, Richard de Umfrevill delivered up his four ſons and his caſtle of Brudhow, as pledges for his fidelity; notwithſtanding which he put himſelf in arms among the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in the reign of Henry III. he obtained a reſtitution, but never had the confidence of that King, who was offended at and diſtruſted him on account of his fortifying his caſtle of Harbottle. He gave one toft and eight acres of land in the town of Prudhow to the Monks of Hexham. His ſon Gilbert ſucceeded to this Barony, and dying the 30th of Henry III. was ſucceeded by</p>
                     <p>Gilbert the ſecond, who was ſtiled the famous Baron, the Flower and Keeper of the northern parts of England.</p>
                     <p>Gilbert the third was by King Edward I. made Earl of Angus in Scotland, and under that title ſummoned to parliament, A.D. 1297. The Lawers at firſt refuſed to acknowledge him as an Earl, becauſe Angus was not of this kingdom; but ſubmitted on ſight of the King's writ, wherein he was ſummoned by that title.</p>
                     <p>Gilbert the fourth, in the 25th of Edward III. exhibited a petition to the King and his Council aſſembled in parliament, ſetting forth, that he and his anceſtors, time out of mind, uſed to have cuſtody of all priſoners taken within the liberty of Reedſdale, to be kept in his priſon of Harbottle Caſtle: which being ſo ruined by the Scots wars, that it was inſufficient to retain them, he deſired he might have leave to keep all ſuch priſoners in his Caſtle of Prudhow, till his Caſtle of Harbottle could be properly repaired. The King being ſatisfied that the fact al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in his petition was true, and conſidering that the ruinous ſtate of Harbottle Caſtle did not ariſe from neglect, granted him leave to keep ſuch priſoners in his caſtle of Prudhoe for ten years.</p>
                     <p>This Earl Gilbert died without iſſue in 1381, having had by his wife Maude, daughter and heir of Thomas Lord Lucy, a ſon named Robert, who, although he died before his father, had been married to Margaret daughter of Henry the ſecond Lord Percy of Alnwick, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue. It ſeems to have been in conſequence of the ſettlement made on this marriage, that the Caſtle and Barony of Prudhow deſcended to the Percies; for it appears among the pleas in the King's Bench, 15 King Henry VI. and Rol. 9. on a traverſe then tendered by Henry Earl of Northumberland, <q>that John Hawborough and John Pykeworth, A<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 49 King Edward III. gave to Gilbert Hamfervile, and to Mawde his wife, and to their heirs lawfully begotten, the ſaid Caſtle and Barony, and the Manor of Ovingham; and for lack of ſuch iſſue, the ſaid Caſtle, Manor, and Barony to remain to Henry Lord Percy, and to his heirs for ever.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In conſequence of this diſpoſition, after the death of Earl Gilbert his widow the Counteſs Maude enjoyed it for her life. She married to her ſecond huſband Henry Percy, firſt Earl of Northumberland, who after her death entered into full poſſeſſion of the Caſtle and Barony, with its appendages, and the ſame continued in his poſterity, without any other interruption except what was occaſioned by the attenders in different periods. Thus on the forfeiture of the ſaid firſt Earl of Northumberland and his ſon Hotſpur, in the reign of King Henry IV. the Caſtle and Lordſhip of Prudhow were beſtowed by the ſaid King (6 King Henry IV.) on his ſon John, afterwards Duke of Bedford and Regent of France, who appears to have held them till his death, except for a ſhort time, viz. 4 Henry VI. when Ralph Earl of Weſtmoreland was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the Mano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So again, 28 King Henry VI. the Caſtle of Prudhow was in poſſeſſion of Sir John Bertram, Knt. but afterwards the whole reverted to the Percies, till they underwent another attainder for their adherence to the Houſe of Lancaſter, in the 4th of King Edward IV. The Caſtle of Prudhow was given to Sir William Bertram, Knt. in the 5th year of that King's reign. After the reſtoration of Henry the fourth Earl of Northumberland, this Caſtle and Barony were again given back to the Percies: and though their poſſeſſion of it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered again ſome ſhort interruptions from future attaintures, in the reigns of King Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth, yet the Caſtle and Barony of Prudhow have conſtantly deſcended, with their other great poſſeſſions, through the ſucceeding Earls of Northumberland, down to their illuſtrious repreſentatives the preſent Duke and his late Ducheſs.</p>

After him Prudhoe came to Walter Tailbois, by marriage with Gilbert the fourth's ſiſter; and under attainder, in the 3d of King Edward IV. A. D. 1463, after the battle of Hexham Levels, it came to the Crown; from whence it paſſed by grant to John Duke of Bedford, and afterwards to Henry Percy, Earl of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, and now conſtitutes a part of the princely poſſeſſions of the preſent Duke of Northumberland.</p>

               <p>the Vindobala, according to Mr Horſley, of the Romans; where the Cohors Prima Frixagorum kept garriſon. Camden calls it Vindolana; and by ſome authors it is ſaid to be the frontier ſtation of the fourth Cohort of the Gauls. Severus's wall runs upon the middle of the eaſt rampart, but is not continued through the ſtation: Hadrian's Vallum paſſes about the diſtance of a chain to the ſouth of it. This fort has been very conſiderable, and the ruins of it at preſent are remarkable: on the north ſide there have been ſix turrets, one at each corner, one on each ſide the gate, and one between each corner, and thoſe adjoining to the gate. On the eaſt and weſt ſides there is alſo a tower between the gate and the angle, in that part of the fort that is on the north of the wall; but it is doubtful whether there has been the ſame number of towers in that part that lays within the wall. The ramparts are ſtill very viſible. If there has been a town without, which there can ſcarce be any doubt of, it has been, as uſual, on the ſouth, where the village of Rutcheſter now ſtands, and covers its ruins.</p>
               <p>To the north-weſt of Rutcheſter, is a place called Whitcheſter, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Outcheſter; in Camden it is called Old Wincheſter, or Vindolana,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0085300201:162"/>
and there are ſaid to be ſome remains of a fort here; but all this ſeems to be a miſtake. There is ſomewhat like the remains of an earthen rampart, which added to the name, may make it probable that here were the Caſtra Aeſtiva of the garriſon of Rutcheſter; and perhaps it was called the Outer Cheſters.</p>
               <p>Between Whitcheſter and Harlow Hill, is a round hill with a trench about it, which ſeems to have been exploratory, and by the ſituation one would judge it had been as ancient as the time of the Romans.</p>
               <p>It is curious to obſerve the paſſage of Hadrian's ditch near Harlow Hill, where it paſſes through a limeſtone quarry; though nothing is to be diſcerned on the ſurface, yet below it the exact dimenſions of the ditch may be taken; becauſe that part of the quarry, through which the ditch has been carried on, is now filled up with earth only, ſo that the ſhape and meaſure here are very plain. It is made ſloping, the depth between eight and nine feet, and about eleven feet broad. At this place a Caſtellum has ſtood; the foundations yet appear. It has had a high ſituation, and commanded an extenſive proſpect.</p>
               <p>At the uſual diſtance from Harlow Hill, a Caſtellum is viſible, and about a furlong weſt from this, the walls approach very near to each other, being not above a chain diſtance. Again, at the uſual diſtance, another Caſtellum appears, but ſomewhat obſcure, and of an uncommon ſhape; two of the ſides (thoſe which lay eaſt and weſt) being about double the uſual length, and the ſouth ſide of it reaches very near the north Agger of Hadrian's work. Mr Horſley was of opinion this was one of Hadrian's exploratory Caſtella; but the north ſide of it falling in exactly with the line of Severus's wall, it has been uſed alſo as a Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellum by him. Severus's wall, in part of this tract, has four courſes of the original ſtone appearing.</p>
               <p>From Rutcheſter to Halton Cheſters is little more than ſeven mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured miles: there are nine Caſtella between theſe two ſtations, and all of them viſible, the interval between every two of them being near upon ſix furlongs and an half; and it is remarkable, that as the interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two ſtations is the greateſt of any upon the whole line of the wall, ſo the intervals between the Caſtella are the leaſt of any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in one ſingle inſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0085300201:163"/>Many Roman Antiquities have been gained here, beſides thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Mr Horſley, viz. an Effigy of Hercules ſome years ago was removed from hence by Mr Duane; two Fibulae of ſilver, Roman Bricks marked LVIV, and Coins of the low Empire, were lately diſcovered; but the moſt valuable acquiſition gained from hence, was an Urn found in 1766, containing gold and ſilver Coins, in the poſſeſſion of the late William Archdeacon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in which, it is ſaid, is a compleat ſeries of thoſe of the higher Empire. In the ſame year was diſcovered a Coffin, cut in the rock, twelve feet in length, containing many bones, teeth, and vertebree or joints, ſuppoſed to belong to animals ſacrificed to Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, whoſe feſtival was obſerved on the third day of June.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr Horſley's Work contains the following Inſcriptions found here:</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. Centuria Voconii Cohortis Poſuit.</p>
                     <p>This is a centurial inſcription in the uſual form: the Centurion's name Voconius is viſible, but the number of the Cohort is effaced.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. Cohors Nona Poſuit.</p>
                     <p>This contains the number of the Cohort, which might probably be one of thoſe that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the work of the wall, from Walbottle hither. It is remarkable, that though we have all the intermediate numbers from one to ten, yet ten is never exceeded on ſuch ſtones: this confirms them to be the numbers of the Legionary Cohorts.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. Centuria Turriai Priſci.</p>
                     <p>This was found near this place; it appeared at firſt fight to be plainly centurial, and of the uſual form; but the implication of the letters is very odd, part of the letters of both the names being thrown together in the ſame cypher, in which no fewer than four or five letters are united. The name Priſcus is in another centurial inſcription at Couſins Houſe, and two in Cumberland.</p>

When I entered this county, I was prejudiced in its favour, and had not the leaſt apprehenſion that any matter neceſſary for the public weal could be neglected. The reſolutions of the Magiſtrates given to the public, will tranſmit their virtues to poſterity. Merchandize has occaſioned, within the laſt century, ſuch an influx of wealth to this county, that it proves Trade is advanced by good roads for carriages, and an eaſy communication with the ports:—how then, in the midſt of ſuch profeſſed virtues, and ſuch public conviction, can it ariſe, that the plain directions of the law, touching the highways, are totally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected or overlooked? There is ſcarce one Guide-poſt, to mitigate the grievances of travelling, erected through the whole county, except in the neighbourhood of Wallington; and ſome of thoſe are obliterated. On the public road from Newcaſtle to Hexham, and on the wilds of Wooler, the traveller is equally embarraſſed.</p>
               <p>As you look upon Bywell from the moſt pleaſing point of view, the landſkip lays in the following order:—From the road near the brink of the river, the ruined piers of a bridge become the front ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; behind which, in a regular caſcade, the whole river falls over a wear, extended from Bank to Bank, in height about eight perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular feet; a mill on the right hand, a ſalmon lock on the left: the town and two churches ſtretch along the banks of the upper baſon of the river, with a fine curvature: the ſolemn ruins of the ancient caſtle of the Baliols, lift their towers above the trees on the right, and make an agreeable contraſt with the adjoining manſion-houſe: the whole back ground of the landſkip appears covered with wood.</p>
               <p>There is a tradition, that two ſiſters quarrelling about precedency, one of them founded a church of her own, from whence ſhe excluded her ſiſter; which was the occaſion of two churches in this ſmall town.

               <p>In the Life of Lord Keeper Guildford, we have an account of a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom held here. As this country was perilous to travellers, the tenants of each manor were bound to guard the Judge through their reſpective precincts. Lord Chief Juſtice North deſcribes his attendants with long
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0085300201:166"/>
beards, ſhort cloaks, long baſket-hilted broad ſwords, hanging from broad belts, and mounted on little horſes, ſo that their legs and ſwords touched the ground at every turning. The Sheriff preſented his train with arms, viz. a dagger, knife, penknife, and fork.</p>
               <p>By the two piers yet remaining in the river, it appears there was an ancient bridge over Tyne here; but as it is remarked by workmen, that the piers have not had a ſpring of arches, it is evident the ſuperſtructure was of wood. The ruins of the chapel appertaining to Bywell Caſtle, are ſituate on the ſouthern banks of the river.</p>
               <p>I cannot quit this delightful ſcene, without making a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the aera of 1580 and the preſent age:—the record I have given in my note, affords a deplorable evidence of the circumſtances attending the inhabitants of Tyne, when they were obliged to guard their cattle every night, and to cultivate no more lands than in proportion to the places of defence they had to ſecure their crops; living in a ſtate of perpetual warfare and jeopardy. And even theſe calamities, which aroſe from a vicinity of thieves and robbers, were trifling, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the devaſtation and ruin, which marked the incurſions of the Scots. Theſe were only the incidental grievances of the times; but there was one which was continued—the vaſſalage and miſery of a feodal tenure; by which genius was kept in fetters, and induſtry was diſtinguiſhed only by the name of ſlavery. What then was the eſtate of this opulent and beautiful county of Northumberland, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the preſent time? What bleſſings have flowed in upon this land, from the union of the kingdoms, and the excellent police of the age? The ferocity of the inhabitants is ſubdued; traffic, arts, ſciences, manufactories, and navigation, have taken place of the brutal warfare, which is extinguiſhed; Cultivation, with all the comelineſs of Plenty, laughs in the valleys; the ſtreams are taught to labour in mechanic ſyſtems, to aid the manufacturer; every Creek and Bay is thronged with Ships; the gloomy Tower, that frowned defiance from each Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, ſinks in the duſt, whilſt a Palace receives the deſcendants of her Lord, with all the bounties of Opulence and Peace. Deſert plains ſtained with Slaughter, and track'd with the progreſs of Rapine and Violence, formerly ſpread forth an extenſive ſcene of deſolation, where now riſing woods, incloſed farms, villages, and hamlets are diſpoſed under the ſmiles of Proſperity. The original naked inhabitants (ſavage from hunger and neceſſity, lurking in dens, and in the mountains
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0085300201:167"/>
prowling as wolves, ſubſiſting in perpetual jeopardy on robbery and rapine) has furniſhed the land with a race, who, at the time they enjoy the comforts of life, reap the fruits of induſtry and the profits of genius, and thereby are progreſſively advancing their families towards opulence. Happy reverſe!—But to return from this digreſſion.</p>
               <p>In the year 1760, an angler found in the river, near Bywell, a ſmall ſilver cup, of Roman work, with a motto engraven on the bottom, Deſideri vivas.</p>
               <p>The cuſtom of wiſhing health or proſperity, at the time of drinking, is very ancient—it is not poſſible to trace it to its ſource: we have teſtimonies of it among the cuſtoms of moſt of the ancient nations: it was uſed as a religious ceremony with many; the wine was offered in the ſacred veſſel, and the Deity invoked; after which a little was ſpilt on the altar, and the public prayer being made, the petitioner put his lips to the cup.</p>
               <p>It would afford great aſtoniſhment to a foreigner, in whoſe country no ſuch cuſtom has gained acceptation, to be brought into a company of Engliſhmen, where jollity and convivial mirth had begun to take place: we will preſume the viſitant, by his interpreter, is introduced to a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the characters before him, in order that we may heighten the lines of his ſurprize:—how would he be amazed, to hear a man, who in common life and converſation expreſſes no religion, morality, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or public virtue, praying with all the vehemence of an Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt, on his knees, before he drinks to the proſperity of the object of his wiſhes; who is, perhaps, no other than ſome factious wretch, and rebellious diſturber of the commonweal; whilſt the circle of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, ſtanding around like Canibals at ſome horrid feſtival, or Daemons at an infernal convocation, in every diſtortion of body and countenance, which can expreſs an agitated ſoul and an inflamed mind, halloo with all the ardour of unlimited licentiouſneſs, in the hideous yells of Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentots?—When ſuch a viſiter, returned to his native land, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ſcene, and tell his aſtoniſhed countrymen, that with the poliſhed Britons this was jollity and public ſpirit; could he be believed?—Would he not, like Mandeville on his viſit to the vale of Devils, to ſave his credit, be obliged to add, "Men ſayen for I hav' not ſeyen." As to my part, I think a vehement Partizan, in the ardent act of drinking a conſtitutional Toaſt, as he would term it, is as odious and ridiculous an Animal as Nature can exhibit.</p>

               <p>in the neighbourhood of Fenwick Tower, next attracted our notice. In the reigns of King John, and King Henry III. it was the manor of Philip de Ulcote, who held it by Grand Sergeancy, on keeping the pleas of the Crown. He was joined in commiſſion with Hugh de Baliol, 17 King John, A. D. 1216, to hold the caſtle and town of Berwick upon Tweed againſt the Barons. It afterwards became the inheritance of the Feltons, till by marriage it devolved on Sir Edward de Haſtings. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was in the poſſeſſion of Sir Ra. Lawſon, and after changing its owners ſeveral times from that period, is now the eſtate of Sir Edward Blacket, whoſe manſion-houſe is ſeated on a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0085300201:169"/>
fine eminence, ſhielded by extenſive woods, above the river Pont, with a viſta of conſiderable extent opening upon the military road. The houſe and pleaſure grounds are highly pleaſing, though not pompous: there is that elegance which perfect neatneſs conſtitutes, to be diſcerned in the whole.</p>
               <p>Adjoining to the eaſt ſide of the viſta, is a rude ſtone Column, nine feet high, near which lately ſtood a Tumulus, which on account of building a farm-houſe, has been deſtroyed; the people living near it, ſay it was near 30 yards in circumference at the foot; but as no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains were left for me to make my obſervations upon, I will give the deſcription found in Mr Wallis's book verbatim. <q>In a field on the eaſt ſide of the viſta, about three quarters of a mile from the houſe, is a circular Mount, with a round cavity in the middle, of the form of the Celtic Tumuli, or Temples; an upright ſtone pillar ſtanding by it, of a great ſize, nine feet high above ground, with flat ſides, three feet broad, and a foot and a half thick. The mount is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of earth and numerous maſſes of ſtone, of the coarſe rag kind, many of which have been digged up for the uſe of this farm, and among them were diſcovered two ſtone cheſts or coffins, conſiſting of four flags ſet edgeways, with a bottom ſtone and a ſtone cover, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the aſhes of the dead, appearing like a white duſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this deſcription, I apprehend it was one of the moſt curious pieces of antiquity, of the Tumuli order, that was in this county, or perhaps the north of England. I humbly conceive it was not a Celtic Temple, as Mr Wallis calls it, being evidently appropriated to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture of the dead; a defilement at no time permitted by the Druids in their holy places. Its diſtant antiquity is proved by the mode of ſepulture; the burning of the deceaſed, after the manner of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, was not attended with the mode diſtinguiſhed herein interment; the Danes uſed burning the deceaſed, but we have no evidence in what manner they practiſed it in England. From the cavity on the crown of the mount, ſimilar to ſome of the Druids monuments I have ſeen, I am induced to apprehend, this was the mauſoleum of the Druid tribe, and of the remoteſt antiquity; and that ſuch cavity was adapted to rites paid to the manes of the deceaſed. Pillars and other memorials of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture, were originally deviſed as mementos to the paſſenger, of the precariouſneſs of our exiſtence, and by remembrance of the virtues of the dead, to promote our emulation. The cuſtom of burning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0085300201:170"/>
of men of rank or power, gained an acceptation in very early ages; it was conſiſtent with the general ideas of thoſe who held the Amonian rites; the ſpirit or human ſoul was eſteemed to be a ſpark of etherial fire, an emanation of the Deity, who made his throne in the orbit of the ſun, to which they looked up in worſhip; which divine eſſence, in this life, was caſed up in members of mortality, during a pilgrimage allotted to it in a terreſtrial ſtate: to reſtore to that element again this offspring of heavenly light, they reduced even the loathſome memorials of its bondage, that nothing ſhould remain which might cauſe it to linger on earth. But I will add no further to this ſubject, than by way of note, to give the reader the quotations and reflections of Mr Wallis.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Temples and funeral memorials like this, with cepititious or ſtone altars, and an upright pillar untouched by the chiſel, are the moſt ancient of any in the world, were raiſed in Judea and all over the Holy Land, by the eaſtern Princes and Patriarchs, by whom they were called Bethels and Elbethels. The manner of conſecration, was with oil poured on the pillar.—One of theſe pillars was erected by Jacob, and he called is the houſe of God. <q>Jacob roſe up early in the morning, and took the ſtone that he had put for his pillow, and ſet it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of that city was called Luz, at the firſt. And he ſaid, this ſtone which I have ſet up for a pillar ſhall be God's houſe. Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, (that is Bethel) he and all the people that were with him. And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel. And Jacob ſet up a pillar in the place where he talked with God, even a pillar of ſtone, and he poured a drink-offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. And Jacob called the name of the place where God ſpake with him Bethel.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The making of altars of earth, or of natural ſtone as formed in the earth, was by the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God to Moſes. <q>An altar of earth thou ſhalt make unto me. And if thou wilt make me an altar of ſtone, thou ſhalt not build it of hewn ſtone, for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou haſt polluted it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe temples were generally erected on the higher ground, ſuch as were moſt conſpicuous and obvious to fight. The one was built by Moſes and another by Joſhua on Mount Ebal, compoſed of whole natural ſtones, or pillars plaiſtered with plaiſter, whereon they wrote the divine laws, in a great and general aſſembly of all Iſrael, of all the princes, great officers, judges, and people of every rank and quality, ſtrangers and others, old and young.</p>
                     <p>Single pillars were alſo erected by theſe holy men over the graves of the illuſtrious dead by ſome public and much frequented road, to have their memories preſerved, and to put the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller in mind of their exemplary virtue and piety, of his own ſhort continuance on the ſtage of life, and to fit and make himſelf worthy of ſuch another honourable memorial at his death, and of an eternal diadem. Thus Jacob buried Rachel, the ſolace and partner of his cares, who died with the birth of their ſon Benjamin. "Rachel died and was buried in the way to Ephrah, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob ſet a pillar on her grave, that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day."</p>
                     <p>Perſons of inferior condition and figure were buried under the ſhady oaks that flouriſhed at the bottom of the mounts on which the bethels or temples ſtood. They were called the oaks of weeping. <q>Deborah, Rebekah's nurſe, died, and ſhe was buried beneath Bethel, under an oak, and the name of it was called Allon Backuth.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heaps of ſtones rudely caſt together were the tombs they aſſigned to infidel enemies after execution, even crowned heads, in avenues and places of great concourſe, to be warnings to the reſt of mankind, how they roſe up againſt the God of Iſrael, and diſhonoured his bethel or holy temple. Such a memorial had the King of Ai, executed by Joſhua. <q>As ſoon as the ſun was down, Joſhua commanded that they ſhould take his carcaſs down from the tree, and caſt it on the entring of the gate of the city, and raiſe thereon a great heap of ſtones, that remaineth to this day.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such a memorial likewiſe had Achan and his family, whoſe bodies were firſt burnt to aſhes, with all their treaſure and wealth.</p>
                     <p>Hence the open temples, the pillars, the obeliſks, the conſecrated groves of oak, the heaps of ſtones reared by the Pagans to their falſe Gods, and to the memory of the dead. Hence the Egyptian pyramid, hence the fair column of the Greeks, the Romans, and of the ſeveral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taught and ruled by the Druids: the primitive religious rites accompanying mankind upon their grand diſperſion at the tower of Babel, about the 400th year after the flood, according to the Samaritan computation.</p>

               <head>HALTON CHESTERS,</head>
               <p>the Hunnum of the Romans, ſituate on an eaſy deſcent; the remains of the Vallum not perfectly to be traced.—This ſtation is the next fort that appears upon the wall between Rutcheſter and Walwick Cheſters, and comes at a due diſtance, and in proper order for the ancient Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, the fifth ſtation in the ſeries of the Notitia, garriſoned by the Ala Saviniana.</p>
               <p>Mr Gordon, omitting the ſtation at Halton, makes Walwick Cheſters to be Hunnum, and ſuppoſes Cilurnum, the next ſtation in the Notitia, to have been between Walwick Cheſters and Precolitia or Carrawbrugh, but now entirely demoliſhed. This cannot hold, for the walls and their appurtenances are here in the greateſt perfection; how then ſhould a fort on that part of the wall be entirely ruined, ſo as not to have the leaſt veſtige remaining? Beſides, the great diſtance between Rutcheſter and Walwick, which is above twelve miles, ſhews that there muſt have been at leaſt one ſtation between them; and on the other hand, the ſmall diſtance between Walwick Cheſters and Carrawbrugh, which is little more than three meaſured miles, renders it moſt unlikely that there ever ſhould have been another ſtation between them.</p>
               <p>Hadrian's Vallum ſeems to have fallen in with the ſouth rampart of this fort, and Severus's wall with the north line of the inner part. There ſeems to have been an aqueduct to convey water to this ſtation, from a ſpring on the higher ground, near Watling-ſtreet-gate: when Mr Horſley paſſed that way, he ſays he was ſhewn a part of it by a countryman, who ſaid, it was what the ſpeaking trumpet was lodged in: of this matter I have treated before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0085300201:174"/>The ruins of the out-buildings are to the ſouth and ſouth-eaſt of the fort. Near about a furlong to the eaſt of Watling-ſtreet-gate, is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Caſtellum, and at the gate there has been a ſquare Caſtellum, half within the wall and half without.</p>
               <p>Mr Horſley remarks, that Severus's military way appears very diſtinct for the ſmall ſpaces where it is ſeparated from Hadrian's north Vallum; regularly paved, but not much raiſed above the level of the ground. When the two are united, they make a military way very beautiful and magnificent: and the reſt both of Severus's and Hadrian's works are ample and conſpicuous all this way. As for the courſe of Severus's military way, and its coinciding with Hadrian's north Vallum, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off from it again at every Caſtellum, it ſeems very curious, and it is remarkable that it has not been more obſerved.</p>
               <p>From St Oſwalds to the river of North Tyne, ſome parts or appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of the walls become more faint and obſcure, and ſome not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible at all; but yet Severus's wall, the ditch, and Hadrian's Vallum and ditch, are very apparent. After the wall has croſſed the Tyne, it goes to Walwick, as before deſcribed: the diſtance from whence to Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Cheſters is near five meaſured miles and a quarter, and in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval there are five viſible Caſtella, beſides one that muſt have ſtood near the river Tyne, but is now entirely loſt. The conſtant diſtance between theſe Caſtella ſeems to have been ſeven furlongs.</p>
               <p>Dr Hunter, Mr Smith, and others, take notice of ſome remains at Portgate, or near it, within a mile of the Cheſters: and in the new edition of Camden, it is obſerved, that <q>there is at Portgate, a ſquare old tower ſtill ſtanding, and great ruins of old buildings.</q> But it was Mr Horſley's opinion this tower had nothing in it that was Roman, being of the ſame form with a multitude of others that are in the north, and of a much later date. The ruins are at Halton, before ſpoken of.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0085300201:177"/>
as it confirms this place to be the Station of Hunnum. The cut of the letters is neither very good nor exact; nor are they very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular as to their magnitude or diſtances one from another; and the the whole favours of the lower Empire. The original is at Conington. Norricus is a Roman name that occurs ſeveral times in Gruter: and the name Meſſorius is found alſo in an inſcription at Riſingham, in this county. The mark at the bottom looked like a part of a letter, as if this ſtone had been parted from another, upon which there was ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. Camden ſuppoſes, that Sabina, Hadrian's wife, gave the name to this Ala: but it was thought more probable by Mr Horſley, that it was taken from Sabinia, the wife of the Emperor Gordian; to whoſe time this inſcription much better agrees.</p>

               <p>Extract from the Newcaſtle News-paper, with an account of an ancient Silver Plate found near Corbridge, in Northumberland.</p>
               <p>"A few days ſince, near the Roman wall in Northumberland, was found by a ſmith's daughter in Corbridge, an ancient piece of ſilver, in ſhape like a tea-board, 20 inches long, and 15 broad, hollowed about an inch deep, with a flat brim, an inch and a quarter broad, neatly flowered with a vine full of grapes, &amp;c.—On the right hand is a figure of <hi>Apollo,</hi> with the bow in his left hand, and a phyſical herb in his right, under a canopy ſupported by two Corinthian pillars; near his left leg is a <hi>Tyre,</hi> under it an <hi>Heliſtrope,</hi> and at his feet a <hi>Python;</hi> near the right hand pillar is another of a different form, with a ſun for its capital; againſt this ſits a <hi>Prieſteſs</hi> on a tripod, who looks over her ſhoulder at <hi>Apollo,</hi> under her feet is an altar, near which lies a ſtag on his back.—The next figure to the Prieſteſs is another female, her head unveiled, with a ſpear or wand in her left hand, on the top of which is a ball, and near her is <hi>Minerva</hi> with a helmet on her head, a ſpear in her left hand, pointing with her right to a man (ſuppoſed an Hunter) on the other ſide of a large tree; on Minerva's breaſt is a <hi>Meduſa's head,</hi> under her feet an altar, and near it a wolf looking up to a man who has a bow in his left, and an arrow in his right hand; below him, at one corner of the plate, is a rock with an urn in the midſt of it, from which flows a ſtream. The figures are raiſed large, and well proportioned and caſt-work, without the leaſt ſign of a graver upon it. There are a few ſcratches of a punch or chiſel on the back of it; the three firſt are I. PX, but the reſt is very unintelligible. It had under the middle of it a low frame, about 7 inches long, 4 broad, and one and an half deep, but this was broken off by the ſmith, though once all of a piece. It was found by a little brook or water-courſe near the above-mentioned place, and weighing about 148 ounces, was bought by Mr Cookſon, a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith of Newcaſtle, who values it at a high rate. It has been deſcribed by ſeveral <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> to the Royal Society, that of the Antiquarians, and others, who eſteem it a valuable relique of antiquity."</p>

                     <p>"My fondneſs to antiquity is revived, and with it the memory of my obligations to you, by a Silver Table that has lately fallen into the hands of Mr Iſaac Cookſon, a goldſmith in this town. It was found near Corbridge, by ſome ignorant poor people, who have cut off the feet in ſuch a vile barbarous manner, that they have broke two holes through the table, and a ſmall piece off one of the corners too. It is 19 inches and ½ long, and 15 broad, the feet 7½ long, and 5½ broad, and about one inch high; it weighs about 150 ounces. I imagine it to have been caſt all in one piece, moſt of the work is in baſſe relief, the reſt engraved. It repreſents a ſacrifice to <hi>Apollo,</hi> whoſe image ſtands in a ſmall temple by two Corinthian pillars, againſt one of them ſeems to be a pile of ſome ſquare blocks, and cloſe to it ſits a Prieſteſs upon a ſtool, that ſhews but two feet; behind her is a column with a globe upon it, I ſuppoſe to repreſent the ſun, though had it been alone I ſhould not have thought ſo: near her ſtands another in the ſame habit, and a third that ſeems to have the attributes of <hi>Pallas,</hi> particularly the head-piece. Near the laſt is a man <note n="*" place="bottom">This figure is Diana, not a man.—R. G.</note> with a bow in his left hand, and an arrow in his right, before him is an altar and a dog, I think a grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound near him; behind him is a large ſpreading tree, with an eagle parched upon it; there are alſo ſeveral ſmall birds about it, but theſe are only engraved. In the lower corner next the man, on the left hand as you look at it, there is a rocky hill, and on the ſide of it lies an urn, with a ſtream of water running out; perhaps deſigned to repreſent the river Tyne. The two ſtanding women hold each of them a ſtaff of their own height. Afore the temple is another altar, on one ſide of which lies a griffin, and on the other ſide next the man, a buck, which ſeems to be killed for a ſacrifice; near the buck grow two ears of corn tyed together, and near the griffin a ſhrub of three or four branches, that has at the end of each branch ſomewhat formed like a fan. There is a border raiſed round the whole, higher than the plain, which is adorned with a vine; the branch is engraved, but the grapes and leaves are in baſſe relief. I am, Sir, yours, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>"Soon after the poſt was gone from hence, I received yours of the 11th. This morning I went to the goldſmith, who ſoon convinced me of my error in ſaying the birds, &amp;c. were engraved; and that all which I thought to be engraved, was ſtruck with the chiſel and punch; ſo that I muſt own your ſuſpicions were well grounded. Mr Cookſon's father happens to be here now; I take him to be well verſed in the art of caſting of metals; he ſhewed me ſeveral marks near one end, in the middle of which end there is a crack; which marks and crack, he ſays, are proofs that it was caſt in one piece.</p>
                     <p>"I enquired again about the price, but Mr Cookſon waved ſaying any thing different from what I mentioned to you yeſterday; which was, that he hoped it would produce him about 200 guineas.</p>
                     <p>"As to the place where it was found, he ſays, he can tell me no more, than that it was ſomewhere near Corbridge. He apprehends the perſon who ſold it to him was afraid to name the particular place, or to confeſs in whoſe manor it was diſcovered, as fearing a claim from the Lord of the Manor.</p>
                     <p>"Since writing the above, I am told a kind of a claim has been made on behalf of the Duke of Somerſet, though neither his Grace's officer nor the goldſmith know in whoſe manor it was found.</p>
                     <p>"On the back of the table there is a kind of inſcription, which I cannot pretend to read, but will endeavour to repreſent it below.</p>

                     <head>Letter from <hi>Sir John Clerk,</hi> in anſwer to one from <hi>Mr Gale,</hi> giving an account of the Corbridge Silver Plate.</head>
                     <p>"The account you have ſent me of the ſilver table found near Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge is very ſurprizing. How happy had Mr Gorden and I been, when we were hunting for Roman Antiquities in that country, if this valuable curioſity had fallen into our hands! As to the uſe of it, I make no queſtion of its being a <hi>tabula votiva,</hi> and that it has been hung up, or kept in a temple, at Corbridge; dedicated perhaps to <hi>Apollo</hi> or <hi>Ceres.</hi> No doubt the Roman officer, who commanded in theſe northern parts of Britain, thought himſelf very happy, to find good meat and drink, in a country where he expected to find nothing, but famine and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity; and therefore in gratitude made this preſent to the God of the place.</p>
                     <p>"I cannot help, ſince I am in this way of thinking, to reflect a little upon what I obſerved in a church, called <hi>Notre Dame de Halle,</hi> about 12 miles from Bruſſels; the walls were hung round with ſilver legs and arms, cups, and ſeveral other things in ſilver, as tokens of gratitude to the bleſſed Virgin, for having by her means and interceſſion, been reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from infirmities and diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>"Among other things, I could not but take notice of a Silver Pen, which old doating <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> had ſent thither ſome years before, out of gratitude, as an inſcription told us, for that by the aſſiſtance of the Virgin Mary, he had been enabled with ſo much eloquence, &amp;c. to write a Treatiſe <hi>de Miraculis B. Virginis Hallenſis.</hi> I called to mind upon that occaſion, paſſages very agreeable to your Silver Table and applicable.</p>

                     <p>"You are pleaſed to expreſs ſome doubt, as to the engraving; and I think you have reaſon. The Romans, I believe, never practiſed our
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0085300201:184"/>
way of engraving, yet they did what was next to it, for they were uſed to cut ſome remarkable laws and edicts in braſs tables, as they uſed to make inſcriptions in marble or ſtone. I have ſeen ſome of theſe, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly at Lyons, which at that time made me reflect on the dulneſs of the Romans, and all mankind beſides, that by means of theſe braſs plates they had not fallen upon the art of printing; for if theſe had been daubed over with any ſort of colour, and clapt upon the paper or parchment, they would ſoon have introduced that art; but there are many plain things that mankind cannot ſee into all of a ſudden, and which are reſerved for poſterity. I'd be glad to hear from you after you have ſeen this fine plate; 'tis well the goldſmith did not melt it down, as ſome modern Goths of this trade have frequently done.</p>

                     <p>"It was with much pleaſure I received and communicated to our little fraternity, your very obliging and ingenious account of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge Silver Table, which honour I am commanded to return you thanks for, and for your very kind promiſe of continuing to us the moſt valuable favour, of your ever entertaining, judicious, and improving correſpondence. On reading your account of that maſſy piece, ſome of us thought it might have been part of an <hi>Acerra,</hi> or ſacred coffer, wherein incenſe and odours were preſerved for the ſervice of the altar, or ſalt, &amp;c. for ſome ſorts of ſacrifices; others have perhaps with more reaſon conceived it to be a ſtand, ſalver, or ſort of waiter to ſet ſuch things on, or even the <hi>Acerra,</hi> or perhaps for domeſtick uſes; for we are too apt to apply every relique of antiquity, as being venerable, to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0085300201:185"/>
ſacred purpoſes. The Society next ſucceeding (which was the 1ſt of laſt month) we had much the like account, but the dimenſions a little different, and the figures or characters on the back ſaid to be I. P. X. with the unintelligible traces of more: to us they are ſo.</p>
                     <p>"Our friend and brother member, Mr Bogdani, in a letter I lately received from him, tells me, you now ſeem to think this piece caſt or wrought in the Saxon <note n="*" place="bottom">This is a miſtake in Mr B. for I never told him ſo, or ever had the leaſt ſurmiſe of its being Saxon.—R.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what has been advanced againſt the judgment of Sir Robert Cotton, Selden, Speed, Camden, &amp;c. I cannot but think that in the main they give us rational conjectures about the Britiſh coins or medals, if we ſhould not allow them to be current coin; for which yet I ſee not any reaſon, unleſs we are bound to take all for truth and fact which the Romans relate, and admit alſo, that they told the whole truth, and all that was really fact, of thoſe brave, polite, and honeſt people, whom they ſo gloried in annoying and diſtreſſing. <hi>Sed manum de Tabulá.</hi>—Only

give me leave by you, Sir, to preſent our thanks to your good brother, for his ingenious Diſſertation on Caeſar's Landing, which gave our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety much pleaſure, particularly our worthy Preſident, and another member, who having ſome years reſided in thoſe parts, well knew all the places therein mentioned.</p>

                     <p>"On the 17th ult. the Rev. Mr Ray, V.

The blade of the ſcythe had teeth like a ſickle, the work ſeemed of ſome age, but as a Phyſician ſaid, not accurate.</p>
                     <p>"He alſo ſhewed a paper MSS. in 24<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. of the whole book of Pſalms, in number 150, written in French moſt elegantly in all the hands in uſe throughout Europe, by <hi>Mrs Eſther Anglois,</hi> a French Lady at <hi>Liſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh en Eſoſſe,</hi> 1599, dedicated to <hi>Prince Maurice of Naſſau,</hi> with a complimentary copy of Latin Verſes to his Highneſs, by B.

This curious little MSS. is bound in velvet embroidered with gold, the leaves finely gilded and painted, with a running foliage ſtamped thereon: the ſaid Prince of Orange's <hi>cognizance</hi> or device is embroidered on the corners in ſilk of proper colours, and drawn with a pen at the end of the book, within a laurel wreath, a branch of palm with the motto, VIRESCIT, on an eſcrol, wrapped round it, and a coronet over it. It was, by tradition, given by the Prince to a French Refugee Gentleman, who was his Surgeon; and from him came into the hands of a Lady, who now

I humbly think, that if theſe figures relate to any known piece of hiſtory among the ancients, they may be modern; but if they relate to nothing of this kind, they may be ancient ſtill, at leaſt of the lower Empire, or the Greek. In <hi>Father Mabillon's Diplomata</hi> there are ſeveral engravings which one would believe to be modern, and yet are of the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th centuries. The argument I now would draw from theſe is only this, that in the 3d and 4th centuries there might have been ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then engravings much of the ſame kind; but you can beſt make the compariſon, who have ſeen the table.</p>
                     <p>"I am ſurprized with what you write me about the reception Mr Blackwall's book <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay or Enquiry into Homer's Life and Writings. London printed, 1735.</note> had with my good friend my Lord Iſlay:—ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other has diſobliged him, for I know his reſpect for all men who are lovers of learning only, as well as the Literati themſelves. He had a particular regard for Mr Horſley, who printed the <hi>Britannia Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana,</hi> and was poſitively reſolved to have done him ſervice about the time when he died. I am, &amp;c.</p>

                        <salute>"DEAR SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>"I am glad that upon viewing the Silver Table you think it ancient. This was always the notion I conceived of it, for I could not imagine any modern Sculptor could get into his head ſo much ancient imagery, without any foundation from ancient hiſtory or fable. I am indifferent who gets the better in the law-ſuit,<note n="*" place="bottom">Duke of Somerſet againſt Mr Cookſon.</note> but I hope it will be preſerved and kept in the country. I fancy with myſelf you will be able to diſcover ſome piece of our hiſtory from it; for I make not the leaſt queſtion but it has been a preſent from ſome of the Roman Emperors, and alludes to ſome memorable affairs at the time. The table has ſerved, I believe, for an oblation of fruits or corn on ſome remarkable altar near the wall, erected to the honour of perhaps <hi>Diana, Ceres,</hi> or <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and that it has afterwards been hung up in the temple dedicated to one of theſe Deities. An Iriſhman would perhaps diſcover the antiquity of Ireland from the Harp, and I believe you will be inclined to think one of the figures is a repreſentation of Britain. I am, &amp;c.</p>

                     <head>Letter from <hi>Roger Gale, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
                        </hi> to Mr <hi>Robert Cay,</hi> upon the Silver Plate found at Corbridge.</head>
                     <p>"When I wrote laſt, I had only time to return you thanks for the favour you procured me from Mr Cookſon, of taking a draught of his moſt curious Silver Table, being to go out of town next morning. Since I came back, upon peruſing the letters I received from you on that occaſion, I find in one of them a deſire of knowing my thoughts upon that ſubject, which I cannot refuſe to a gentleman who has laid me under ſo many obligations, and to whom the pleaſure and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment I have received from the frequent views of that uncommon and valuable piece of antiquity, are entirely due; and the leſs, becauſe the accounts hitherto publiſhed of it ſeem to me not a little erroneous.</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall begin to deſcribe it from the right hand to the left, as you look upon the face of the plate, where <hi>Apollo,</hi> the principal figure in the whole piece, is placed in a <hi>fanum</hi> or ſmall temple, (the roof of which is ſupported by two wreathed columns with flowered capitals) almoſt naked, having only a <hi>pallium</hi> hanging down from his left ſhoulder over his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0085300201:189"/>
back; in the ſame hand is his bow, which he holds up towards the top of the column on the ſame ſide; his right hand is extended down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with a branch in it, perhaps of laurel, croſs that pillar; againſt which, almoſt to the middle of it, riſes a pyramidical pile of 12 pieces: for what it is intended, I muſt confeſs my ignorance.—<hi>See the plate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Againſt the baſis of the left hand column, reſts a lyre, whoſe form is truly antique; and beneath it grows a plant with three ſpreading flowers at its three extremities, deſigned, as I ſuppoſe, for an <hi>Heliotrope;</hi> cloſe by it couches a <hi>Griffin,</hi> with its wings elevated over its back. The Ancients had ſo high an opinion of the ſagacity of this fictitious animal, that they conſecrated it to the God of Wiſdom: <hi>Begerus</hi> gives us a medal of <hi>Commodus,</hi> the reverſe whereof is <hi>Apollo</hi> in a chariot drawn by two <hi>Griffins;</hi> and the poet <hi>Claudian</hi> alludes to this manner of his riding, in the following diſtich:

                     </p>
                     <p>"Againſt the right hand column and this pyramidical pile, ſits a woman, upon a ſquare four-footed ſtool, though no more than two of its legs are viſible; ſhe looks backward over her left ſhoulder towards <hi>Apollo,</hi> and is wrapped up in a long garment or ſtola, from head to foot, and veiled. By this attire, and the altar which was brought from Troy, with the eternal fire burning upon it juſt by her, I take her to be <hi>Veſta.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <l>—Manibus vittas, veſtamque potentem</l>

                     <p>Her left hand is repoſed upon her breaſt, and in her right, which reſts upon the ſame thigh, ſhe holds a little bundle (bound about with a ribbon) perhaps of wool.</p>
                     <p>"Below her lies a buck, dead, on one ſide, turning up his belly; and behind her riſes a tall pillar with a globe upon it, probably to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the earth, of which ſhe was Goddeſs.</p>
                     <p>"The next is a woman erect, her hair gathered up and tied with a knot behind, upon her forehead riſes a <hi>Tutulus,</hi> and ſhe is habited in a <hi>Stola</hi> from her ſhoulders to the ground: her right arm is wrapped up croſs her breaſt in her garb, only the hand appearing out of it; in her
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0085300201:190"/>
left ſhe holds a ſpear, the ſhaft twiſted, the iron of it ſomething obtuſe. This ſeems to be the only human figure in the company; but a very learned gentleman <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Blackwall, author of the Inquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer.</note> of my acquaintance thinks it may be deſigned for <hi>Juno,</hi> who is often thus accoutred with a ſpear; if ſo, it muſt be the effigies of <hi>Juno curis,</hi> or <hi>Juno haſtata,</hi> we have it from Ovid,
<q>"— Quod haſta curis priſcis eſt dicta ſabinis."</q>
She was the ſame with <hi>Juno pronuba;</hi> 
                        <q>Celebri haſta nubentis caput co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebatur, vel quia <hi>Junonis curitis</hi> in tutelâ eſſet, vel ut fortes viros ominaretur;</q> but as there is no peacock, nor any other attribute of her divinity attending her, and her appearance no ways majeſtick or adequate to the
<q>
                           <l>—Divum regina, Joviſque</l>
                           <l>Et ſoror et conjux.</l>
                        </q>
I cannot be entirely of his opinion, eſpecially as ſhe ſeems by her poſture and attitude to be a follower and attendant of the next figure, which is plainly <hi>"Pallas—Galeá effulgens et Gorgone ſaevá,"</hi> the head of that monſter, as uſual, being fixt upon her breaſt. In her left hand ſhe holds a ſharp-pointed ſpear, her right is extended towards <hi>Diana,</hi> with whom ſhe ſeems engaged in a very earneſt diſcourſe, to which alſo that Goddeſs ſeems very attentive: ſhe is the laſt figure in the group, though called a man in all the accounts I have ſeen of this table, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented here as the <hi>Diana venatrix</hi> by the <hi>coif</hi> and feminine dreſs of her head, tuck'd up with a knot behind like the hair of the third figure, as well as by the bow in her left and arrow in her right hand. Her ſhort <hi>Tunica,</hi> which reaches down little more than to the middle of her thighs, and her buſkins, that come up no higher than the calf of her legs, has occaſioned this miſtake of her ſex, but Ovid tells us,
<q>
                           <l>"Talia ſuccincta pinguntur crura <hi>Dianae</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>"Cum ſequitur fortes, fortior ipſa, feras."</l>
                        </q>
Between the two figures of <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> riſes a tall ſlender tree with a crooked waving ſtem, the branches of which are diſplayed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt over two-thirds of the top of the plate. On the main branch is perch'd an eagle, with one wing expanded, as if going to take a flight: this is of raiſed ſolid work, like the reſt of the figures, but there are ſeveral ſmall birds ſitting among the boughs, that are only punch'd, or cut in with a tool, as are alſo ſeveral feſtoons hanging down from the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0085300201:191"/>
tree, and many other little ſhrubs and flowers interſperſed all over the area of the table. The great bird ſitting directly over the head of <hi>Pallas,</hi> made me conclude at firſt that it was her owl, till I had ſeen the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, which convinced me that it can be deſigned for nothing but an eagle.</p>
                     <p>"Under this tree ſtands an altar, and ſo cloſe to <hi>Diana,</hi> that ſhe holds her left hand and bow over it. It is but little, and has nothing upon it except a ſmall globular body, perhaps a maſs of the <hi>Libamina, ex farre, melle, et oleo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"I ſhould have told you, that below the feet of <hi>Pallas</hi> grows a plant, which ſeems to bear two ears of corn upon the ſame ſtalk, but cannot ſay what it is, or how it belongs to her. Beneath the tree and the little altar, ſtands a thin-gutted dog, like a greyhound, his noſe turned up in a howling or barking poſture, as often exhibited with this God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs on medals, and in other repreſentations of her: ſome
<q>
                           <l>— Acutae vocis Hyclator</l>
                           <l>Aut ſubſtricta gerens Sicyonius Ilia Ludon.</l>
                           <bibl>Ovid.</bibl>
                        </q>
Under her, in the very corner of the plate, riſes a rock, upon which ſhe ſets her left foot, and againſt the ſide of it lies an <hi>urn</hi> with the mouth downwards, diſcharging a plentiful ſtream of water. As ſhe ſtands upon this rock or hill, and ſo near to this ſpreading tree, I cannot but think of Horace's addreſs to her,
<q>"Montium cuſtos, Nemorumque Virgo."</q>
The whole table is encompaſſed with a border, raiſed near an inch high, and ornamented with a creeping vine, whoſe grapes and leaves are in <hi>relievo,</hi> but the ſtalk only tooled.</p>
                     <p>"The work of this curious piece is neither of the beſt or worſt of times: the figure of <hi>Veſta,</hi> particularly, is extremely well executed, the poſture free, the drapery ſoft and eaſy; and what is very remarkable, the <hi>inſtita</hi> or border, an ornament of the <hi>ſtola,</hi> appropriated to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ladies of quality.</p>
                     <p>"Quarum ſubſuta talos tegit inſtita veſte,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Horace.</note> is neatly worked all round this of our <hi>Veſta,</hi> and thoſe of the other female Deities, nor is the next figure much inferior. I cannot, nor has any body elſe who has ſeen it, diſcover that the plan has any relation to any ſtory in the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0085300201:192"/>
                        <hi>Heathen Mythology,</hi> but ſeems only an aſſemblage of the Deities it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents: this may be ſome argument of its antiquity,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Sir John Clerk's Letter, 6th Auguſt, 1735.</note> for had a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern workman had the deſigning of it, he would in all probability have taken ſome known piece of hiſtory for his ſubject; to which I may add, all the ſymbols are genuine, and truly adapted to their owners.</p>
                     <p>"I was once of opinion, that it might have been the cover of an <hi>Acerra,</hi> but the foot which ſupported it puts an end to the ſurmiſe. We don't well know what the <hi>Anclabris</hi> was, the definition of it is in <hi>Feſtus</hi> as follows: <q>Anclabris menſa divinis miniſteriis apta: dicebantur autem an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clabria, et Anclabris ab anculare quod erat miniſtrare.</q> This is big enough to contain the <hi>Exta</hi> of a ſheep, or other ſmall victims, which ſeems to me to be the likelieſt employment for it, and that it was one of theſe ſacrificing utenſils that Virgil more than once calls <hi>Lances:</hi>

As you give leave to conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the female figure, erect, her hair tied up with a knot behind, with a ſmall oval,<note n="*" place="bottom">The oval is much too big for a pearl.</note> perhaps a Britiſh pearl (for which our coaſt was in the Roman times famous) her right arm wrapped up, a ſpear with an obtuſe point in her left; permit me to opine this may be in honour to our iſle, and to repreſent <hi>Britannia,</hi> as on a coin of <hi>Hadrian</hi> in my col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or <hi>the Genius of Great Britain</hi> ſtill retained in the reverſe of our copper coin, but in a ſedentary poſture; ſometimes by the Ancients with an <hi>haſta pura,</hi> ſometimes armed with an iron ſharp-headed one; here, as between both, with an obtuſe blunt-headed one; as worn in war <hi>ſe defendendo</hi> amongſt the Romans. I know not what elſe to think it, and as formed amongſt us, who ſo likely? The pyramidical figure I take only to denote <hi>ſtabilitas aeterna,</hi> and was, though in a leſs elegant form, the device of repreſenting the Deity in the earlieſt times of art, before ſtatuaries had taught marbles to aſſume limbs, and almoſt to breathe. Whatever this noble piece of plate was deſigned for, I take it to have been a grand compliment to our native country, and am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now the more deſirous of being poſſeſſed of a drawing of it.</p>

We muſt yet call it the Corbridge Plate, ſince at preſent it is ſaid to have been found near that town; though I am inclined to think it is only given out ſo, to conceal the true place where it was diſcovered. When the bill that the Duke of Somerſet has filed in Chancery, againſt the preſent poſſeſſor of it, for <hi>treaſure-trove</hi> in his
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0085300201:194"/>
royalty, comes to be argued, we may come to the truth. This conteſt with his Grace, made the owner very ſhy of letting it be ſeen by any body, and it was not without great importunity that a gentleman, to whom he was under the ſtrongeſt obligations, procured me the favour of taking a draught of it, and upon condition that I ſhould not permit any one to copy it, nor know where the original (which has been ſhifted into two or three hands) is now depoſited.

I had ſome weeks ago given a very ſhort account of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures on this table, to Sir John Clerk at Edinburgh, a gentleman whoſe learning and judgment are of a ſuperior degree. He had, from what I ſaid to him, the very ſame opinion as yourſelf about the unknown figure, viz. that it might repreſent <hi>Britannia,</hi> but I believe both you and he would change your thoughts upon inſpection of it: it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Roman by the habit, and not the leaſt circumſtance attending it that may honour our country with being in ſo celeſtial a rendezvous of Deities.</p>
                     <p>"Your conjecture upon the <hi>pyramidical pile</hi> I like well: I was once of opinion that it might have been ſome ſort of an altar dedicated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and that the 12 pieces of which it conſiſts, might have ſome relation to the 12 months of the year. <hi>Tellus Stabilis</hi> we have upon the coins of <hi>Hadrian, Sabina Fauſtina Pii,</hi> and <hi>Commodus,</hi> but without this <hi>pyramis;</hi> in our table it is erected as near to <hi>Veſta</hi> as to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and ſo may be an attribute belonging as well to her, the Goddeſs of the Earth, as to him, the God of the Year.

Which conjecture has been confirmed by Mr Graham of Netherby, who ſays there are ſtill traces of the croſs ſtroke forming the top of the Π, which is the firſt letter in the name of the perſon who conſecrates the altar.</p>

                     <p>Mr Wallis (if not an error of his printer) ſeems to be more miſtaken than Dr Todd in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this altar, ſuppoſing it to be an altar in honour of Tyrian Hercules, dedicated to Diodora the Prieſteſs. V. 2. p 127.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0085300201:196"/>There are ſome ſingular circumſtances attending theſe altars, which may perhaps be deemed companions.—They furniſh the only Greek inſcriptions which were ever found in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; they both conſiſt of a ſingle hexameter; they are inſcribed to Syrian Deities; and they are diſcovered in the ſame pariſh of Corbridge —It is not extraordinary that Greek inſcriptions ſhould be ſcarce in England, it is rather neceſſary to account, why any ſuch ſhould have been diſcovered: Though the Romans moſt commonly uſed their own language and characters, yet ſome of them muſt have been born under circumſtances which made the Greek tongue more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to them; we need therefore only ſuppoſe that <hi>Pulcher</hi> and <hi>Diodora</hi> (who dedicate theſe two altars) were the ſon and daughter of a Roman officer quartered in Greece, or ſome neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing province, and who died ſoon after he had children by a Grecian wife; the Greek language would certainly be more familiar than the Latin to a Roman with ſuch an education. They both conſiſting of hexameters, ſeem to prove, they were dedicated about the ſame time, and and that they were intended to be companions, eſpecially as their outward form is very ſimilar, as well as the characters made uſe of. The greater difficulty ſeems to be, why both altars ſhould be inſcribed to the Syrian Deities, <hi>Aſtarte</hi> and <hi>Tyrian Hercules.</hi> This however it ſeems may be accounted for to ways, Pulcher and Diodora might poſſibly have either reſided or been born in Syria, and had perhaps received ſome good fortune, which they might aſcribe at leaſt to theſe Deities. It is conceived, that wherever a Roman continued for anytime, he probably worſhipped the local Deities, when there were not temples at hand which were erected to the Gods adored at Rome. Such Romans therefore might continue their veneration for Aſtarte and Tyrian Hercules, when removed from Syria to Britain. But poſſibly, it is not neceſſary that Pulcher and Diodora ſhould have been at all in that province. There is one difficulty however ſtill remaining, with regard to the altar dedicated to Tyrian Hercules, which is, that it is inſcribed by a Woman and Archprieſteſs. At firſt it ſtrikes, that ſhe muſt have been Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſteſs to ſuch a God, and I believe there are few inſtances of women having this dignity in the temples of male Deities at the ſame time that there would be a particular indelicacy if they devoted themſelves to Hercules.</p>
                     <p>As for theſe altars being found at Corbridge, it is eaſily accounted for, if the above conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are allowed in other reſpects, becauſe it is known to have been a conſiderable ſtation, and near to the Roman wall. The inſcription on the altar to the Tyrian Hercules hath already been four times engraved, and may perhaps be matter of curioſity to compare the different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, as the ſtone is ſoft, and ſeems to have ſuffered within theſe 70 years, ſome of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0085300201:197"/>could: at firſt ſight I diſcerned a manifeſt difference in ſome things between the original and copies that had been publiſhed in the <note n="*">Ph. Tr.

However, being very diffident of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when I happen to differ from others, I prevailed with a curious gentleman to go on purpoſe to take an impartial account of it. I got alſo another to do the ſame, and all our three copies agreed with a ſurprizing exactneſs. I have turned over all my papers this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in queſt of the firſt copy, but can by no means find it; the other I have met with, and ſent you incloſed. My own is in the hands of the Engraver at London, and the plate containing this inſcription is ready, and I believe wrought off. I take the plain meaning of this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be no more than, that this altar was erected <hi>to Hercules by Diadora the Arch-prieſteſs,</hi> if it be to the <hi>Tyrian Hercules,</hi> the 3d letter in the 2d line muſt have been a double Rho, thus Φ, ſo as that it is <hi>Tirrio</hi> for <hi>Tyrio.</hi> There is a flaw in the ſtone at the head of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo as that it may have been cloſed at the top, but by that part of the letter left in the breach, I am very certain that there was no Y in the inſcription. The word in the 2d line may be <hi>Tirrio, Tiphio,</hi> or <hi>Tipſio,</hi> probably a topical name, but <hi>Tyrio</hi> I am ſure it is not.</q>

                  <q>Several ancient writers take notice of the peculiar regard and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip paid to Hercules by the Tyrians. Arrian ſays his temple in that city was the oldeſt upon record. Diodora the Arch-prieſteſs, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this inſcription, might perhaps be devoted to his ſervice. That this was an office of great dignity, and not below perſons of the firſt rank, appears from another inſcription, produced by Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faucon, which is, <hi>"Caracylaea Arch prieſteſs deſcended from Kings."</hi> We have likewiſe an inſcription in the Marmora Oxonienſis, where one Aurelia Fauſta has this title given her: that inſcription having been erected at Smyrna, the learned Editor ſuppoſes the Lady was Arch-prieſteſs to Diana; and among other reaſons he aſſigns this, becauſe Prieſteſs miniſtered only to female Deities. Now if this obſervation was univerſally true, it would deſtroy the ſuppoſition above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, relating to Diodora. But there is an inſcription in Gruter, ATERIA SACER — DATIS PA—, which I think can mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>Ateria Prieſteſs of Pluto.</hi> And Pauſanias ſays expreſsly, that it was cuſtomary for a virgin to officiate as Prieſteſs in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Neptune, in Calaurea. It appears therefore, by theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that women were not wholly excluded from the prieſthood of male Deities. Caracylaea, in the inſcription of Montfaucon, is ſaid preſently after to have been wife to C. Julius Severus; the ſame, as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0085300201:199"/>
Montfaucon thinks, who, according to the Faſti Conſulares, was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul in the year 155. And why may we not ſuppoſe that Diodora was married to ſome commander of the Roman forces, who brought her hither, where ſhe erected this altar, in honour of the Deity to whoſe ſervice ſhe had been particularly devoted? And the like may be ſaid with reſpect to other Grecian Deities, whoſe altars are found here in Britain, (as Jupiter Dolichenus and Dea Syria) which might be ſet up by perſons originally of thoſe countries where theſe Deities were more particularly worſhipped.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The other altar is dedicated to Aſtarte,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Aſtarte was the ſymbol of the moon, being worſhipped by moon-light in open temples and groves, firſt with pure and afterwards with impure rights. In the ſacred writings (Judges iii. 7. 1 Reg. xi. 5.) ſhe it ſtiled Aſhtaroth, alſo the Deity and Abomination of the Sidonians. The prophet complains, that Solomon went after Aſhtaroth, the Goddeſs of the Sidonians. Jezabel firſt paid her divine honours in Iſrael, the moſt ancient temple, that of Aſcalon, 400 prophets ſerving therein.</p>

                        <q>The perſon who communicated this inſcription to the Society a few years ago informed us, that it was found about Corbridge, <hi>near the wall,</hi> where, as there were many Roman Legions, particularly the Legio Secunda Auguſta &amp; Viceſima Victrix, ordered thither, the firſt from Iſca Silurum, the other from Deva, or Cheſter, in order to keep the wall in order and defend it, we can make no doubt of its being Roman, notwithſtanding it is written in Greek charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for this manner of writing inſcriptions was an affectation frequently to be met with in the lower Empire, or after the time of Conſtantine; and was ſometimes carried ſo far, that when the language was entirely Latin, the character was Greek, and vice verſa, examples of which are to be found in Fabretti Inſcrip. p. 390 and 465.</q>

               <p>This altar, ſuppoſed to be inſcribed by the Prieſt, is attributed to a Marine Legion, raiſed by Hadrian in Syria, called the Ulpian Legion: which followed Carauſius in the time of Maximian.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>The following ſhort Anecdotes of Carauſius may not be diſagreeable:</p>
                     <p>The Emperor Carauſius is repreſented as a graceful perſon. He was deſcended of Britiſh parents. The Britiſh Empire by ſea is attributed to him. Conſtantine inſtituted the office of Comes Litoris Saxonici, which Carauſius filled with immortal honour; the Saxons in that age ſending forth a ſet of daring pirates, who diſtreſſed the Britiſh coaſt. Under Maximian he held the office of Admiral of the Roman navy. He advanced to ſuch a height in the eſteem of the people, that he was induced to throw off the Roman authority, and aſſume the Imperial power in Britain. Maximian, with the whole naval force of Rome, approached the Britiſh coaſt to chaſtiſe him for his temerity, and his aſſociates for their defection. He withſtood them near the Iſle of Wight with the Britiſh navy: he ſought and conquered; and from that time held the ſupreme authority independent of Rome, ſuperior to all its power. But ſuch is the precariouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of human glory, ſuch the inſtability of ſublunary things, this hero fell by the hands of an aſſaſſin, in his palace at York; ſlain by the traiterous ſword of an inſiduous wretch, under the ſpecious character of a friend.—There is not in human life a more happy acquiſition than a friend, where we can find "the feculence of falſhood long thrown down," giving all the mind to benevolence and generoſity: but on the other hand, there is not ſo pernicious an enemy, as he who, under a ſpecious character, inſinuates himſelf into the boſom of a generous and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded man, and there, like Milton's toad, "poiſoning the animal ſpirits," carries on the operations of the Devil. If the regions of the damned are permitted to ſend forth the tribes of Lucifer to torment mankind, thoſe of ſuperior diabolic and infernal talents, muſt take upon them this moſt accompliſhed of helliſh characters.</p>

               <p>where are the remains of a Roman Station: it is unnoticed in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titia, and is conjectured, was abandoned at the time of taking that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Roman Empire in Britain. It is not larger than thoſe ſtations near the wall, before deſcribed: the remains of the Pretorium are yet very conſpicuous. This ſtation ſtands on the tongue of land formed by the ſtream of Cor, at its conflux with the Tyne. Nothing curious remains at this time, but the foundations of a bridge, viſible at low water, believed to be of Roman conſtruction.</p>
               <p>Dr Todd, in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, ſuppoſes the name to have been originally Herculceſter, i. e. Caſtra Herculis. What led him to this opinion, is the altar with the Greek inſcription dedicated to the Tyrian Hercules. Mr Horſley was of opinion, <q>that as Corſtopidum had been generally, ſo it is very juſtly, placed at the ſtation near Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. This place has generally been taken for Ptolomy's Curia Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denorum, becauſe there ſeems to be ſome affinity between the names, and becauſe the Otadini muſt certainly be placed hereabouts;</q> but he differs in opinion concerning this matter, and concludes that Corſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidum and Curia were different names, and altogether different places.</p>
               <p>The Ermin-ſtreet way, having croſſed the Tyne, proceeds towards Ebcheſter, in the biſhoprick of Durham, and continues its courſe almoſt in a meridian line to Dover, in Kent, as may be ſeen in Antoninus's Itinerary. Another military way paſſes from this place ſouth-weſt through Dilſton Park, over Hexham Fell, to Old Town, in Alondale, and meets with the Maiden Way at Whitley Caſtle, as is ſet out in Mr Warburton's Map of Northumberland.</p>
               <p>The Romans were excellent architects, and by all the deſcriptions given of their bridges <note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſactions.</note> in Britain, teſtified their geometrical knowledge: their arch was ſemicircular, their pillars multangular, with a ſharp angle to the ſtream, like the prow of a ſhip. The foundations of the piers were conſtructed of an horizontal arch made of ſtones, in the form of a wedge, as appears by the remains here. In ſituations ſubject
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0085300201:204"/>
to rapid floods, a ſmall arch was formed in the pier, to receive the water when it began to reach the bow of the arch.</p>
               <p>Many Roman Antiques have been found here; ſuch as coins, ſeals, &amp;c. but moſt of them of the lower Empire.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Many Seals of Roman work were found at Corcheſter: Greek and Roman Antiques were always of the moſt exquiſite workmanſhip; engravings on gems, pebbles, and ſtones, of the firſt order for beauty and luſter. The beril, the chalcedony, the emerald, hyacinth, the topaz or modern chryſolite, and the garnet, were favourites. The chryſtal pebble and the amathyſt were alſo eſteemed. They alſo uſed the onyx, the ſardonyx, the agate onyx, the jaſper, the haemachates or blood-ſtone, which they valued for cameos. Other kinds were not uſed by the Romans till the lower Empire, when the arts were upon the decline: then camelians and ſtones of an inferior claſs were introduced. Of this order and ſpecies are the intaglios found at our Roman Stations. The Greek maſters excelled the Romans in the art of ſculpture and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving; who reſigned their genius more to oeconomical and political refinements.</p>

                     <p>In Mr Horſley's Works we have the following inſcriptions and ſculptures:</p>
                     <p>No. C. Imperatori—Marco Aurelio Antonino tribunitiae poteſtatis.</p>
                     <p>This is in the fore wall of a houſe in Corbridge, on the right hand as you enter the village from the eaſt: it has no doubt been a curious inſcription, and is twice taken notice of in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, by Dr Hunter and Dr Todd. I do not underſtand Dr Todd's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, who ſays, <q>there I ſaw altars inſcribed, one Imp. M. Aurelio—another Leg. II. Aug. Coh. IIII.</q> But this and the following ſtone which he refers to, are honorary monuments, not altars, and neither of the inſcriptions are exactly repreſented, as appers from the copies I have given, which are taken from the originals. This ſtone is broken both on the left ſide and at the bottom; ſo that although the inſcription belongs to one of the Antoninus's, yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Marcus Aurelius, Commodus, or Caracalla, may be a queſtion.</p>
                     <p>CI. Legionis Secundae Auguſtae, Cohors Quarta Fecit.</p>
                     <p>This is in the church wall, and no doubt muſt be the ſame with that which Dr Todd men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is of the ſame ſort with thoſe which have frequently been erected by the Legions and legionary Cohorts, when they were employed in building any work, and, I believe, uſually ſet in the face of it. The O and H are imperfect, part of the upper ſtratum of the ſtone being gone off.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This inſcription is more imperfect than either of the former: it is broken at the top, and at one end, and is now fixed in the corner of a houſe in the town The letters which remain are very fair, but one cannot tell how much is wanting. I was told that this ſtone was found not many years ago, and that there were more letters upon it when diſcovered, which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards broken off by the workmen, when they put it into the wall. If we ſuppoſe the word in the lower line to have been Vallum or Valli. and C is in the preceding line, to have expreſſed the number of paces, we have ſtill more reaſon to regret the loſs of the reſt of it. I could not be ſure that the laſt imperfect ſtroke was the top of an I, though the ſituation of it ſo high makes it probable. The leaf before the word Val does not favour the antiquity of it.</p>
                     <p>CIII. The ſculpture repreſented, is in the front of an old houſe. The victory is curious and entire, being winged, with the uſual drapery and attitude. What ſhe takes hold of, ſeems to have been the ornamental part of a ſtone, on which there has been an inſcription. The only peculiarity is, that ſhe ſeems to ſet each foot on a ball or globe.</p>
                     <p>CIV. The leſſer of theſe ſtones is in the jamb of a door, and the larger lies at the door of another houſe in the town. The people call this latter a horſe. I have placed them both under the ſame number, as believing them to be of the ſame kind. The latter appears to be a lion, with ſome other animals under him, the head of which is broken off. In the other, the heads of both animals are gone. The lion does not ſeem to be devouring or deſtroying the other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, but rather deſending it, and I believe it is of the ſame nature with the ſculpture at Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He looks upon them as the mementos of days of diſtreſs, when every man formed his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the number of fellow-creatures he could harneſs, to miniſter to his pride, and contribute to his crimes: as dens of ſavages, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of prey, who, like the wolves of the foreſt, held warfare with all the creatures of the earth; and worſe than wolves, employed the powers of rationality to render them more rapacious, more cruel, and more blood-thirſty than mere animal inſtinct could inſinuate to the heart: even cruelty, blood-thirſtineſs, and rapacity againſt their fellow-creatures, of which wolves are not accuſed. He looks upon them as monuments of ſepultured oppreſſion, over which the olives of peace are woven by the hand of liberty. He regards them as the hallowed records of all thoſe ineſtimable jewels which beſet the Britiſh diadem, and enrich the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh conſtitution; whoſe luſter ſtrikes the eye of the whole obſerving world with envy, admiration, and aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>But Dilſton gives the obſerver other ſentiments: tears ariſe upon the eye for the crimes of men, who in oppoſition to ſalutary laws (for good effects ſtamp the law with the character of propriety) through miſtaken principles, imbrue their hands in civil diſcord. It is the miſtake in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, gives the tears to flow: reſolute wickedneſs extinguiſhes all pity;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0085300201:207"/>
but humanity feels for man's hallucinations, for the errors of judgment —for ſuch, pity is even divine.</p>
               <p>Another diſagreeable reflection wreſtles for a place in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative mind, on ſuch a view—ſtrange, is the rapacity of men, who are ready to take poſſeſſion of the moment of overthrow, and with greedy hands ſeek to ſhare the ſpoil, even of him for whom once they fought, of him whom they had loved, had ſerved, had feared—their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, protector, and friend.

               <p>where lays the moſt pictureſque, though confined landſkip, the whole county of Northumberland exhibits. We aſcended to the brink of the precipice, near 200 feet high, from whence we looked down upon a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered vale, almoſs inſulated by the brook, conſiſting of a fine level plot of corn land, of about eight acres, in the exact form of a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoe; the brook paſſing over a rugged rocky bottom, under the ſhadow of lofty hills, in various broken ſtreams was ſeen on each hand, foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from fall to fall, which gave a beautiful contraſt to the deep hue of the groves. From the brook, the hills to the left ariſe precipitous, cloathed with a fine hanging wood, then glowing with a full ſunſhine; to the right, the ſteeps laying from the ſun, and in the deep ſhade, were broken, and ſcattered over in wild irregularity with bruſhwood, and here and there a groteſque and knotty tree preſented itſelf impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the precipice; in front, a fine eminence of brown rock lifted its rugged brow, and cloſed the circle, dividing the waters with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory a few yards wide. In the clefts, and on the little levels of the rock, ſome ſhrubs grow; on its crown ſtood ripened corn, margined with hedge-row trees, through which a cottage was diſcovered; and by its foot, a winding road ſoon eſcaped the eye in intercepting woods: the rays of light fell happily upon the cliffs, and brightened their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring. To the right and left, the more diſtant brook ſhewed itſelf in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0085300201:208"/>
deep and rocky dells, embowered by lofty oaks. To the right hand, the hill which ſurmounts the wood, is topped with a plain of graſs ground, on whoſe brink ſtands a farmhold, acceſſable by a narrow path winding up the ſteep, from whence the woods make a beautiful curvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the diſtant back ground is compoſed of heath lands. On the left, woodlands were ſeen on the circus, winding on the mazy channel of the brook, here and there intercepted by heathy eminences; the back ground very diſtant, and tinged with a miſty azure. To grace the little enchanted vale, reapers were buſy with the harveſt: in ſome parts the furrows looked like waving gold; in others they were emboſſed with upſet ſheafs. This is the fineſt natural theatre I ever ſaw; the circle is almoſt geometrically juſt; the plain would have ſuited thoſe exhibitions, of which we read, with an anxious curioſity, in the hiſtories of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; they would have given it life, taken away the ruſticity, and made it noble. When we deſcended to the vale below, it appeared only to want ſome of the ſacred rites, to improve its ſolemnity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the idea of hallowedneſs with greatneſs. One poſſeſſed of a true taſte for natural beauties, is apt to be wound up to a pitch of enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic rapture, at ſuch ſcenes as theſe; where every ſubject that can compoſe a rural proſpect, are thus fortunately adjuſted and diſpoſed.

He erected a croſs in the front of his army, and bending to the earth, called upon the name of Chriſt, beſeeching his mediation with the Father of all, in whoſe hand alone is the event of battle, that he would eſtabliſh juſtice on the face of the earth. As inſpired, he aroſe and called aloud to his troops, (as Bede writes) <q>Let us all kneel down, and beſeech the Almighty, the living and true

                  </note> After this prayer, he put his little army in battle array, his troops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warmed with that energy which devotion gives, and which prompts to intrepid actions. <hi>Cedwall</hi> advanced, arrogantly confident in his numbers, and inſolent from his victories, aſſuring himſelf of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on his oppoſer, whom he ſought with contempt. He attacked the intrenchments, and mounted the ramparts in perſon; when a fatal ſhaft pierced his boſom, and laid him in the duſt. His followers, diſmayed at the fall of their leader, halted—a panic ſeized them—their ſwords ſtayed from aſſault, and as if perplexed by inconſiſtent commands, they began to retire in confuſion. Oſwald perceiving the change, took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the occaſion, and inſtantly ruſhing upon the enemy, in a dreadful onſet, put them to flight: the carnage became horrid, the number of ſlain was incredible, and thoſe who eſcaped the ſword were totally diſperſed.

               <p>Camden ſays Riſingham implies the Giants habitation. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that in the darkneſs of antiquity, we find innumerable traditions of powerful perſons, and mighty atchievements, under the characters of Giants; which at this time, according to Mr Bryant's moſt excellent work, denote ſome great temple, the character of ſome powerful people, ſome mighty Ruler, or miſerable Tyrant. Camden relates, that the inhabitants in his time had a traditional tale of the God Magon, who defended himſelf here, and maintained his fortreſs againſt a certain Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain or Heathen Prince. This relation, he ſays, is authenticated, as to the reality of ſuch a perſonage as Magon, in the ages of antiquity, by two Roman inſcriptions found in the river there. From our utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, we could not trace any remembrance, legendary tale, or heroic ſong, touching ſuch perſon as Magon, now remaining.</p>

Reading the two laſt words of the fifth line PRIMASTA for Prima Statione, makes the ſenſe natural and eaſy.

               <p>I muſt leave the Roman line, and attend to more remote antiquity, to define, if poſſible, the name of Magon. I preſume Mr Bryant has thrown ſuch happy lights upon the ancient mythology, and has proved his principles by ſuch teſtimonies, that with implicit confidence I may adopt his maxims. I ſhall have ſeveral occaſions to reſort to his work, in the progreſs of my journey through the mountainous part of this county, for etymologies of thoſe ancient names, which without his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections I ſhould have paſſed over as incomprehenſible; and ſo loſt in the miſts of antiquity, as to remain without ſolution.—As it is little doubted, fire-worſhip was once the accepted religion of this iſland, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by eaſtern viſitants, and profeſſed and practiſed by the Druids; in theſe wild and uncultivated parts, it is moſt probable, the ſtrongeſt evidence thereof would remain to this age. I find in Mr Bryant's ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicals, as he terms them, that the word Ω—ON, was one of the titles
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0085300201:218"/>
of the Sun among the Amonians,<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. chap. xli. ver. 45. Exod. chap. i. ver. 13.</note> and was often in combination with other epithets, uſed by the Syrians, Cretans, and Canaanites. He alſo therein ſpeaks of the word Macar, as a ſacred title given by the Amonians to their Deity, and was frequently compounded Macar—on: from whence a people were donominated <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Macarones, and places were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Macron. The corruption of a name, received from the pronunciation of unlettered and ignorant inhabitants, who had handed it down traditionally for ages, is not to be wondered at; from Macron to Magon is a ſimple and eaſy corruption. From the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracy of theſe rude inſcriptions (as appears in the ſecond, even in the name of the invoked Deity) it is not to be wondered that G took place of CR; or from the obliterations in them through age and time, the tranſcriber might miſtake <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for G, a ſmall letter being frequently introduced in the middle of a word. Take Mr Bryant's arguments on traditions of the like nature, and the whole relation given by Camden is reſolved into an hiſtoric fact—that the worſhippers and prieſts of <hi>On,</hi> who held here their religious rites, in the temple of the Sun, were a formidable ſociety, powerful in their numbers and their learning.</p>
               <p>That the eaſtern religion and rites were introduced to this iſland is certain; that the Romans, in many inſtances, are known to have adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the topical Gods; they alſo, from an error in etymology, gave to perſons, names which were relative to places; and when in Britain, they either introduced their own manner of worſhip, or otherwiſe adopted the Britiſh Deities, or rather the Amonian titles which they found there, and gave them perſons as Divinities. To prove this, I ſhall quote the inſcription before ſpoken of, in the Cottonian collection, found at Great Cheſters (page 35) <note n="†" place="bottom">Bryant.</note> Sur being a title of the Sun, <q>Syria being deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from thence, is at this day called Souria, from Sur and Sehor, the Sun. That Suria was not merely a provincial title, is plain, from the Surya Dea being worſhipped at Eryx, in Sicily, and from an inſcription to her at Rome.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Romans had an averſion to the Druids, who ſuffered no idols to be ſet up: they took infinite pains to extirpate them, and deſtroy their monuments. Here then we find the remainder of Camden's tradition, that the prieſts of On, the worſhippers of the Sun at Riſingham, long withſtood the Roman arms: to pacify the people, and incite them to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0085300201:219"/>
mix in their worſhip, the Romans erected their Altars on the ſacred mount, and inſcribed them with the Amonian titles.</p>
               <p>If I may be allowed to make another conjecture, that the topical Deities to whom theſe altars were dedicated, prove the worſhippers of the <hi>Sun</hi> held here the <hi>Amonian Rites,</hi> and that from thence was derived the tradition mentioned by Camden, I would preſume this latter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription was either incorrectly copied, having in the original an A and M mixed thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or the firſt letter in the name of the Deity was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Sculptor, or intentionally neglected by the Dedicator, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in many other inſtances; and that properly it ſhould have been AMOUNO: <hi>Amoun</hi> being a Grecian mode of expreſſing AMON. I have before ſhewn, from Mr <hi>Horſley's</hi> authorities, that the Grecian expreſſion is uſed in many Roman inſcriptions yet extant. This altar would then appear to be dedicated to <hi>Ammon,</hi> the topical Deity of <hi>Riſingham,</hi> at the time of the acceſſion of the Romans. For the ſake of impartiality, it it is neceſſary to admit, that the dedication to <hi>Ammon</hi> might be from Grecian auxiliaries; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, <q>that of all the Egyptian names which ſeemed to have correſpondence with the <hi>Zeus</hi> of Greece, <hi>Amoun</hi> or <hi>Ammon</hi> was the moſt peculiar and adequate.</q> And from <hi>Herodotus</hi> we learn, that <q>almoſt all the names of the Gods in Greece were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious, having been brought thither from Egypt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Camden ſays, ſo much we may gather from theſe inſcriptions, as to aſcertain the name of the place <hi>Habitancum,</hi> and that he who made the firſt inſcription was <hi>Beneficiarius</hi> to a Conſul, and Primate of the place. The <hi>Beneficiarius</hi> was either by promotion, or ariſing from exemption of military ſervice by diſpenſation: they attended the chief officers of the army: they ſeem to have been ſomewhat like thoſe we now call <hi>Cadets:</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Horſley.</note> and the <hi>Primaes,</hi> as appears by the <hi>Codex Theodoſii,</hi> were chief magiſtrates of cities, towns, or caſtles. Camden leaves us in the dark as to <hi>Magon,</hi> not even determining whether he was eſteemed the tutelar God of the <hi>Gadeni,</hi> whom Ptolomy placed next the <hi>Ottodini.</hi>

                     <hi>Jovi Optimo Maximo. Dolocheno Julius Publius Pius Tribunus votum ſolvit libens merito.</hi> This was publiſhed ſome years ago by Dr Hunter, in the Philoſophical Tranſactions. I am of opinion it has been the body or plane of an altar, having met with ſeveral parallel inſtances, where the capital and baſes have been ſtruck off from altars, in order to fit them for walls, or ſuch other uſes. The appearance of the ſtone fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours this conjecture, and upon this ſuppoſition, I believe the altar has been inſcribed to Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolochenus, and that the letters I. O. M. have either been at the top of the plane, and ſtruck off with the capital, or elſe upon the capital itſelf. The word Dolocheno is very plain upon this inſcription; but in all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and writers who mention this Deity, the name is ſpelt with an I or Y in the ſecond ſyllable; excepting one, which though it be ſo likewiſe in <hi>Gruter,</hi> yet in <hi>Petrus Apianus,</hi> who had publiſhed it before, it is writ, as <hi>Montfaucon</hi> obſerves, with an O, in the ſecond ſyllable, like this. Poſſibly the letters PVBL, in the ſecond line, may not be another name of the perſon, but ſtand for Publitia, the name of the tribe to which this <hi>Caius Julius</hi> belonged. This tribe is often mentioned in <hi>Gruter.</hi>
                  </q> As to the Divinity Dolochenus, I ſhall have

                     <p>The original I found placed for a ſeat, at the back door of a houſe at Cheſterhope. The firſt word may have been Militum, and the other letter a C. in CVI: and as the Cohors Prima Tungtorum, has Militum annexed, I once ſuſpected that this altar rather belonged to the Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grian, than the Vangiones, from the inſcriptions at the Houſe-ſteads, in one of which we alſo meet with the name Superſtis.

The Emperors, in honour of whom it has been erected, I take to be <hi>Severus and Caracalla,</hi> who were much hereabout, and, I believe, were poſſeſſed of this very ſtation. This Cohort ſeems to have been like a flying ſquadron, for by inſcriptions we find them in ſeveral places. The inſcription is included in a kind of <hi>corona,</hi> or rather an octagon, circumſcribed by a ſquare moulding. There are ornaments of eagles heads on each ſide, above which is the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of two faces, probably deſigned for thoſe of the Emperors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to by the inſcription. Mars and Victory, in their uſual dreſs and appearance, are ſet in a nich, one at each end of the ſtone. The other ornaments ſeem only to be ſuch as pleaſed the fancy of the Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.

It has been a fine altar, but is now turned up-ſide-down, ſo that the capital was hid in the ground.

               <p>Mr Horſley ſays, <q>this inſcription has in its manner ſo much the appearance of the lower Empire, as to confirm that the Romans were late poſſeſſed of this ſtation. The original is now at Conington. The rudeneſs of the letters, the ſcattered poſition of them, and the ſtops on each ſide the I, in the laſt line but one, are very remarkable. Though DM be at the top, yet it is not an altar, of which there are other inſtances.</q>

               <p>This ſtation was certainly gone to decay before the reign of <hi>Caracalla,</hi> and afterwards was reſtored: and this opinion is favoured by the laſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0085300201:226"/>
imperfect inſcription, found at this place; from whence it appears, that ſomewhat had been repaired which had gone to ruin through age.</p>
               <p>The remarkable effigy of <hi>Robin of Riſingham,</hi> as it is called by the country people, next claims my attention: I will in the firſt place give Mr Horſley's deſcription, and then offer ſome few remarks of my own. <q>The remarkable figure which uſually goes by the name of <hi>Robin of Riſinghom,</hi> or <hi>Robin of Redſdale,</hi> is cut upon the face of a huge piece of rock, that has fallen off from the main one. It is on the ſide of a hill or rock near the park head, and about half a mile from the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Riſingham. The image is in <hi>baſſo relievo,</hi> and both the ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſtone very coarſe. I take it, by the drapery and ſymbols, to be certainly Roman, though ſome, from the rudeneſs of the ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have thought it Britiſh: and probably it is the Emperor <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> repreſented under the figure of <hi>Hercules.</hi> The ſquare ſtone beſide him, muſt I ſuppoſe be an altar, and what he carries in his left arm a club: on his left ſhoulder are diſtinctly ſeen a quiver and arrows, and in his right hand a bow, which agree with the character given him by <hi>Herodian,</hi> who celebrates him as a moſt excellent archer. What he wears on his head looks like a helmet. Every body knows that <hi>Commodus</hi> affected to be called the <hi>Roman Hercules,</hi> and to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as ſuch. We have his coins with <hi>Herculi Romano Auguſto, Herculi Romano Conditori,</hi> &amp;c. This figure then might repreſent the Roman <hi>Hercules</hi> triumphant and victorious, after things had been ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in Britain by <hi>Pertinax,</hi> and <hi>Commodus</hi> aſſumed the name of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicus.</hi> The face of the whole piece of rock on which the image is cut, is an irregular figure of five ſides: the ſide which reſts in the ground is ſix feet and an half; the perpendicular from the <hi>vertex</hi> to this ſide, eight feet; the two ſides to the right of this perpendicular each of them five feet; the uppermoſt ſide to the left ſeven; and the lower four; and the ſtone is juſt about ſix feet thick. The figure ſtands upright.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The doubts which I entertain that this is Roman work, are founded upon the following circumſtances: The veſt in which the figure is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited is open from the waiſt to the knee; round the waiſt is a belt buckled before: the looſe garment on the ſhoulders, leaving the right arm bare and at liberty, is put on in the manner of the Scotch plaid: the cap is not ſimilar to any one I remember to have ſeen in Roman ſculptures: the bow is in the right hand. But that the reader may paſs his own judgment upon this ſculpture, I have given an etching of it.</p>

               <p>Before I quit the neighbourhood of Bellingham, I muſt notice the remains of a caſtle ſituate near the confluence of the brook Tarſet and North Tyne. I did not view the place; the deſcription, together with a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0085300201:228"/>
drawing, was communicated to me by my friend, at Newcaſtle. It ſtands within the Lordſhip of Tarſet, and has the name of Tarſet Caſtle. Camden ſays it was a caſtle of the Comins. The area is of an oblong ſquare, in length about 120 yards; defended by a deep foſs, near 10 yards in breadth, on the north, weſt, and ſouth ſides; the eaſt laying on a ſteep deſcent. At each corner of the area appear the remains of turrets or mounds. There ſeems to have been an outward wall, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the tower.</p>

                     <p>This was removed to Durham, where it now is. It is very curious; and the remark is juſt, which the ingenious Dr Harle made, when the altar was firſt dug up, that the lines which are wanting, had been evidently ſtruck out with a tool; which is uſually obſerved to have been practiſed on revolutions in the Empire, or upon the perſons falling into diſgrace, who is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the inſcription. This particularly is thought to have been done with relation to <hi>Geta,</hi> by the order of his brother <hi>Caracalla,</hi> in ſome other inſcriptions in Britain; though I cannot think that the name of <hi>Geta</hi> has been upon this altar; for this neither agrees with the letter C, yet very plain and viſible, nor with the ſequel of the inſcription, which is very clear and diſtinct. <hi>Bono generis Humani Imperante Calparato Agric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The diſturbances in England in the time of King Richard II. induced the Scots to invade the borders, in the 12th year of that reign, with about 3000 men, under the command of Sir William Douglas, by ſome authors ſtiled Earl Douglas.

Percy, who for his intrepidity and martial proweſs was ſurnamed Hotſpur. He met him in the hotteſt of the battle, inſolently braved the young hero to engage, and Douglas fell beneath his valorous ſword. The ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of their leader's overthrow ran through the Scottiſh lines; they were intimidated, and began to fly; but at the inſtant the panic was becoming general, and the Engliſh were advancing in hopes of victory, the Earl of Dunbar came up with a large reinforcement, and the Scots rallied. Now overpowered by numbers, and faint with the fatigues and bloodſhed of the fight, the Engliſh gave way, and the invaders were victorious: yet ſo powerfully, and with ſuch gallant reſolution, did the Engliſh maintain the battle againſt ſuperior force, that the loſs on each ſide was ſaid to be nearly equal. The Engliſh left 1800 dead upon the field. Among the priſoners were Lord Percy and his brother, Sir Robert Heron, Sir Robert Ogle, Sir John Lilburn, Sir John Colwell, and many other valiant men of Northumberland.</p>
               <p>A circumſtance attended this day, as unfortunate to the Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians, as ſhameful to their allies: the Durham militia was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but did not come up in time to ſupport the Engliſh, before they had left the field to the victors: the Scottiſh leader not willing to hazard any more of his troops, thought it expedient to uſe ſtratagem, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly aſſailed the reinforcement in a mode totally new, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily prevalent: he cauſed all his ſoldiers to blow the horns which were uſed to ſound an alarm; the ſtilneſs of the night, the echo from the hills, and the terrors which the overthrow of the Northumbrians had impreſſed upon their minds, wrought ſo powerfully, that the militia were ſeized with a panic, and put to flight without ſeeing an enemy, vanquiſhed ſolely by the tremendous idea of thouſands approaching fluſhed with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Replete with melancholy reflections, ariſing from ſuch a ſcene and retroſpection, eight miles to Riecheſter muſt neceſſarily paſs heavily; it is the buſineſs of a ſentimental writer to catch the momentary ideas and living ſentiments as they riſe; the illuſtrious names renewed to memory, by the place of Otterburn fight, the Percies, the Herons, Ogles, Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burns, and many more, buſy on that famous night, brought upon my mind reflections on the honour of pedigree. Our ideas are apt to claſs themſelves into compariſons.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0085300201:233"/>
I determined that <hi>the Pride of Pedigree</hi> was laudable, ſo long as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant did not debaſe his blood by ignoble and impious actions. I admitted it as a maxim, that ſuch had a right to public place, pre-eminence, and diſtinction. Then it was, I took (as it were) the other hand into conſideration; a review of the modes of the world; and thence proceeded to compare my determined principles with characters well known to me. I remarked many who claimed place and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtand up as the givers of modes, and rulers of what ſhall be called propriety of manners; ſuch a groop of characters crowded upon me, (the muſhrooms of a morning) all ruſhing with ardour and avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of mind to the goal of pre-eminence, Wretches ſprung from the filth of a corrupted age, that their mimick importance created in my mind ſo ridiculous a picture, even amidſt the waſtes and wilds where I travelled, and in defiance of all the deformities which nature ſpread around me, I could not forbear laughter.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Mr Horſley's</hi> reaſon for ſuppoſing the <hi>Cohors Prima Hiſpanorum</hi> to have been part of the <hi>Ala Herculea,</hi> is their being quartered nearly together; the firſt at <hi>Elenborough,</hi> and the other at <hi>Old Carliſle,</hi> as appears by inſcriptions found at thoſe places.</p>
                           <p>I believe this Cohort arrived in Britain with the <hi>Emperor Hadrian,</hi> and continued there till the <hi>Romans</hi> quitted the <hi>iſland,</hi> and in a ſeries of about 300 years, it muſt have made ſeveral marches and counter marches from one camp to another. My reaſon for thinking it came hither with that Emperor, is from its appellation <hi>Aelia,</hi> and its country <hi>Spain;</hi> the latter of which might prevail with him, who was a Spaniard by birth, to dignify it with one of his own names; and when he tranſported the <hi>Legio VI Victrix</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> he might bring this <hi>Cohort</hi> among the <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> that were joined to it: this alſo inclines me to think it was part of one of the <hi>Alae</hi> belonging to that Legion, which ſeems always to have been employed in the North, and to have had its head quarters at <hi>York.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The legionary <hi>Alae</hi> conſiſted of ſeveral Cohorts of foreign Auxiliaries, though of how many is uncertain: ſometimes we are told they were equal in numbers of men to the <hi>Legion,</hi> and ſometimes that they exceeded it: it is therefore probable, that both the <hi>Alae</hi> of a Legion might contain <hi>ten Cohorts,</hi> the number of thoſe that conſtituted a <hi>Legion,</hi> when compleat.</p>
                           <p>I cannot therefore agree, that the <hi>Cohors Prima Hiſpanorum</hi> was compoſed of two <hi>Alae,</hi> the 1<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. <hi>Herculea</hi> and the <hi>Ala Vettonum;</hi> ſince <hi>Alae</hi> were formed of <hi>Cohorts,</hi> and not <hi>Cohorts of Alae.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ala</hi> alſo imported a large independent body of horſe, and of this ſort ſeems to have been the <hi>Ala Vettonum,</hi> and the <hi>Ala Prima Aſturum,</hi> the <hi>Ala Sarmatarum,</hi> &amp;c. all which carry the the names of the countries they originally came from.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Legio VI Victrix</hi> was in <hi>Britain</hi> when the <hi>Notitia Imperii</hi> was compiled, as were all thoſe <hi>Ala;</hi> it is not therefore unlikely, that the <hi>Ala I Herculea,</hi> and the <hi>Ala Sabiniana</hi> were the wings properly appertaining to it, one ſo called from the Emperor <hi>Maximianus Herculeus,</hi> the other retaining the name of the Empreſs <hi>Sabina</hi> or <hi>Sabinia,</hi> either the wife of the Emperor <hi>Hadrian</hi> that brought this Legion into <hi>Britain,</hi> or of the Emperor <hi>Gordian the Third,</hi> who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the other wing of it with his own name, which is moſt probable, becauſe from the name <hi>Sabina</hi> the appellative adjective <hi>Sabinia</hi> would be properly formed; and from the name <hi>Sabinia,</hi>

                           <p>I know very well that the firſt Cohort of a Legion uſed ſome times to be called Milliaria, for ſo Roſinus and Vegetius, and before them Modeſtus had taught me. I know it conſiſted both of horſe and foot, but I thought it a tautology to add after prima Cohors theſe letters. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> EQ wherefore I imagined that there was more intended (viz.) directly to ſignify that the whole Cohors conſiſted of horſe, in number 1000, or that there was belonging to the Cohors 1000 horſe, who were quartered at Netherby; but what was of greater weight with me was, that I believed, that in the latter times of the Roman Empire there were Cohorts entirely of horſe Pliny, in the tenth book of his Epiſtles, and I think the 107th Epiſtle, furniſhed me with a direct proof of this, for he expreſly mentions the Sexta Cohors Equeſtris. There was another proof occurred to me, from the 25th chapter of Suetonius in Vita Claudii, where Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <desc>•</desc>

I pleaſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo with the fancy, that if the old Lipſius had ſeen this altar, he had acquieſced in the above cited words of Suetonius, and not have read them Semeſtres Militias. Some of your editions of that author will direct you to a ſquabble amongſt the Critics upon the reading of thoſe words, which in my apprehenſion this very altar at Netherby may decide: but be the reading what it will, it pleaſes me to think that there were Spaniſh horſe amongſt us in former times, which perhaps contributed not a little to that breed of horſes which is in thoſe parts to this day. I believe the Jock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>I have only now to add a conjecture of mine, as to the apparent ſtreets in the town of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therby, (viz.) that they were ſtables for horſes, and of this very kind there are ſeveral in the ſtation at Middleby: nothing was fitter than horſe to defend them againſt my old countrymen the Fugaces Caledonii.</p>

                           <p>A letter from you is always extremely acceptable, ſince it never fails of bringing its enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment along with it. I never pretended <hi>Ex Tripode loqui,</hi> and if I ſhould, my reſponſes would have no more weight than thoſe of the oracles, always dubious, oftener falſe than true. I am much afraid, what you charge me with in your laſt, will come out wrong, though your conjectures are very ingenious. As you have communicated them to me, I doubt not but you will give me leave freely to ſend you my thoughts upon them.</p>
                           <p>As for the O. M, they can have been nothing but the remains of <hi>Jovi Optimo Maximo,</hi> and perhaps what follows is the remains of <hi>Vexillatio,</hi> though I am not without my ſcruples as to that. In the firſt place, I do not remember I ever met with ſuch an inſcription as <hi>Vexillatio Cohortis</hi> or <hi>Cohortium,</hi> though frequently with <hi>Vexillatio Legionis,</hi> which I take to imply a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment ſent off from the Legion under a <hi>Vexillum,</hi> where we meet with thoſe <hi>Vexillationes Leg.</hi> II.

                           <p>My abſence from home was longer than I deſigned, and ſince my return have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented examining originals till this morning: this has occaſioned a delay of the fuller anſwer I intended and promiſed. I received the <hi>Riecheſter</hi> inſcription juſt before the preſs came to the other inſcriptions belonging to the ſame place, and having no great fondneſs for an appendix, I immediately diſpatched to London ſome ſhort obſervations on it, in order to their being printed, and inſerted in their proper place; ſo that before I received your firſt letter, it was too late to make any alteration there: however I muſt beg leave to take notice of your conjecture, either in the preface or ſome other proper place. <hi>Mr Ward</hi> intends a letter to me, by way of review of all the obſervations, and there is a proper ſpace left for that letter, in order to its being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted at the end of the obſervations on the ſecond Book of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia Romana.</hi> This letter will be inſtead of an appendix,<note n="*">
                                 <p>There is no notice taken of this in Mr Ward's letter, but Mr Horſley in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility reprinted his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this inſcription. See his Brit. Rom. p. 241, 242.</p>

                              </note> and any new diſcoveries and thoughts will. I believe, be there inſerted. I ſhall communicate yours to him on this occaſion, unleſs you rather chuſe to ſpeak to him yourſelf: though I have not wholly abandoned my firſt conjecture, yet I have a good opinion of yours, and no doubt, conſidering how natural it is to have a partial regard for our own offspring, yours will have the preference much more in the eſteem of others.</p>
                           <p>I have carefully and impartially examined all the letters on the ſtone, and am convinced that the laſt viſible, though imperfect letter in the 6th line, has been an N, which favours your opinion. I have with my compaſſes compared the breadth of this letter, with that of all the M's and N's on the ſtone, and find that it agrees pretty well with the ſtated or uſual breadth of the N, but always falls ſenſibly ſhort of the breadth of the M. This ought to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in the copy, though whether it be or not, with ſufficient accuracy, is more than I am ſure of. The addition of SE at the end of the line, would bring it to an equal length with moſt of the reſt; nor have I in this review obſerved any thing on the ſtone, which is in the leaſt unfavourable to your opinion. On the whole, I ſtrongly incline to think you muſt be in the right, and that my own conjecture muſt have the honour to be overthrown by ſo good a hand as your own, and the <hi>Lancheſter</hi> inſcription reduced to its primitive ſtate of confuſion and darkneſs.</p>
                           <p>The remains of the letter at the end of the laſt line but one, may be thoſe of a C, but are likeſt thoſe of an O, the ſhape and poſition will by no means allow it to be the top of an S; it is thus DEC, but more perfectly round than I have here drawn it I have compared it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with the S. the C and the O in the inſcription, and find that it ſuits the laſt beſt, may do for the ſecond, but not at all for the firſt.</p>

On the face of the ſtone where the inſcription is cut, there appears in two or three places the plain marks of fire; the ſame appearance which I obſerved on another of theſe ſtones found in this place. The letters of the inſcription are well cut, and all of them that remain are ſtill very fair and diſtinct; only a piece of ſtone is broken off at one corner, which cannot yet be retrieved; and with it a ſmall part of the inſcription is loſt, the addition of <hi>Socio</hi> to <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mr Horſley's remarks on this altar are as follow. <q>The original was removed to Connington. The plain and diſtinct mention of Bremenium upon this large altar does ſtrongly argue Riecheſter to be the place. The implication and proper cut of the letters, which is neglected in Camden, I have endeavoured to ſupply from the original. No body that I know of, has given a ſatisfactory explication of the D. R. S. at the top: I think it plain that they are to be read <hi>Deae Romae ſacrum.</hi> That they made a Goddeſs of Rome, and erected altars and temples to her, needs no proof to thoſe who have any acquaintance with medals and other Roman Antiquities. There is a curious altar at Elenborough, erected <hi>Genio Loci Fortunae Reduci Romae Aeterne,</hi> &amp;c. I once thought of <hi>Diis Romanis ſacrum:</hi> but this ſuits not with <hi>Numini ejus</hi> in the body of the inſcription; for which reaſon the learned Dr Gales reading <hi>Deabus Rumabus Sacrum</hi> cannot be admitted. The altar then is ſacred to the Goddeſs <hi>Rome,</hi> erected by a <hi>Duplares</hi> of a detachment of <hi>Exploratores</hi> or ſcouts at <hi>Bremenium,</hi> under the command of <hi>Caius Caepio Charitinus</hi> the Tribune. Caepio is a conſular name, and we read in the Notitiae, of a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus Numeri exploratorum Lavatris.</hi> Whether they were the ſame with theſe, I will not undertake to determine. The <hi>Duplares</hi> were ſoldiers, who had a double allowance of corn, of which a part of the Roman ſoldiers pay conſiſted. The <hi>Exploratores</hi> were, like our ſcouts, ſent out to diſcover the enemy or their country. When they were in garriſon, it is probable they were generally placed, in the more advanced ſtations, or ſuch as were moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſituated for proſpect and diſcovering the firſt approach of the enemy; as alſo for guarding the paſſes againſt their inroads.</q>

When the barbarous nations had broken through the wall of Antoninus Pius, and would in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence hurry over and lay waſte all the country before them, the wall of Hadrian laying neglected to the time of Severus, we may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily admit that this ſtation was regarded as the limit of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, from whence the old <hi>Itinerary,</hi> which bears the title of Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine's, began, viz. <hi>a Limitis.</hi> The conſtruction given it, to imply <hi>a Vallo,</hi> is only a gloſs put on it by the tranſcriber.</q>

               <p>Near Nunwick, ſome years ago, were the remains of a monument, by moſt writers termed Britiſh, conſiſting of five natural ſtone pillars, placed in circular order, near eight feet in height, and twenty feet in girt; the area which they formed, was ninety feet in circumference. Whether the interſtices were heretofore filled up with ſtones of a ſmaller ſize, to compoſe a circle, which on the advance of cultivation were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, we have no evidence: Biſhop Gibſon only ſpeaks of them as in the ſtate deſcribed. I have great doubt, whether this was a temple or place of convocation of the Druids, or not: I am rather inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſuch as are compoſed of a ſmall number of ſtones are Daniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, and memorials of ſome public act of that people. Where the

                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0085300201:249"/>In the Monaſticon we are told, King Edward taking diſpleaſure at Anthony Beck, then Biſhop of Durham, diſmembered this church from that See. It was afterwards in the poſſeſſion of the D'Arcys in the reign of King Edward III. John D'Arcy, at his death, left it to Queen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippa, who gave it to Windſor College.</p>
               <p>Mr Wallis ſpeaks of a remarkable Scull dug up within the walls of the church: <q>On the back part of it was the figure of a large ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop ſhell: at one of the auditories, the figure of a torcular ſhell, like a ſcrew.</q> It is ſurprizing no Naturaliſt has attended to this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful phaenomenon. Mr Wallis himſelf, I ſhould have apprehended, would not have left this great curioſity ſo ſlightly treated of. He doth not even ſay, whether theſe impreſſions were ſculptured, or adheſions of petrified matter. In either caſe, it would have gratified the virtuoſo to have had a perfect deſcription. We read of that degree of wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inhumanity, that the ſculls of enemies, at public feſtivals, were uſed for drinking Cups. Was this ornamented with ſculpture, it would lead to an apprehenſion it was once employed in ſuch unhallowed rites. If theſe were petrifactions, it would ſtill be more wonderful.</p>
               <p>This introduces to my mind a haſty idea, of petrifactions being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed a teſtimony of an univerſal deluge. It has been inſiſted upon by many learned men, but the diſcoveries hitherto made in that branch are in no wiſe convincing. Moſes had his learning from the Egyptians; Mr Bryant has amply diſplayed their knowledge of that great event: I dare not make ſtrictures on that learned work; but opinion is fond of liberty. All the petrifactions I have ſeen in the various collections, do not prevail to fix my judgment in favour of ſuch teſtimony. In the firſt chapter of Geneſis, we ſee the grand work of creation claſſed in ſix progreſſive orders. In the figures of Eaſtern language, it is given under a diurnal arrangement. By ſuch expreſſion, I preſume, we are not to be confined in our idea of the work, to thoſe ſhort periods: the works of Providence are wonderful to the higheſt degree, in a courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0085300201:250"/>
why ſhould we render them ſtill more miraculous, and leſs cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, by holding to the very letter of the book of Geneſis, without giving a latitude to the expreſſion. So much of miracle, and ſo little of reaſon, in modern diſſertations, occaſions much infidelity. We ſee plainly the work of the divine Architect was progreſſive: let us preſume each day means an age, in which, by a natural and progreſſive courſe, "the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, whoſe ſeed is in itſelf," might arrive to its maturity, from the original ſtamina the great Creator ordained in the beginning. It was not till the third aera, that the dry land appeared; all before was deluged. Here is a period then, in which all thoſe ſubſtances which we find have left their teſtimony in petrifac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might reſt upon the higheſt hills, when at the command of their God, the mountains heaved themſelves up from the boſom of the deep. The ſhifting of vaſt ſands, the falling of mighty precipices rent by earthquakes, mining in various countries, and eruptions of volcanoes, have brought to light thoſe materials which are lodged very deep in the earth, and yet none of them have produced any evidence of the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the human race, by petrifactions of parts peculiar to mankind, their implements or utenſils, of which gold would not decay, erections, or other memorials of their antediluvian exiſtence. To enter at large into this diſquiſition, would lead to a ſeparate work; it ſhall ſuffice at this time to ſay, that, if there were no other teſtimonies exiſting than petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, to prove this great event, we ſhould ſtill depend upon implicit faith concerning it. To return:</p>
               <p>The church of Symondburn has two dependant chapels, Bellingham and Falſton: the pariſh is between thirty and forty miles in length, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Liddeſdale, in Scotland. There is within this diſtrict, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Falſton and the extreme boundary, an extenſive tract of country where, till within the laſt century, converſion had ſcarce reached, or the benefits of religion and the rites of the Engliſh church been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged, except in the collection of tithes.</p>
               <p>Symondburn Caſtle was demoliſhed by the country people, in vain reſearches for treaſure: a ſmall part was lately repaired, with two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular turrets, as an ornamental object on the landſkip.</p>

To prepare for her interment, a cave was hewn in the rocks of Harnham, below the foundations of the caſtle, where her remains now lay in a leaden coffin.—It is a diſgrace to a poliſhed and enlightened nation, that ſuch a Court has exiſtence; but to a ſtate profeſſing the rights and religious tenets, and enjoying the liberty of Britain, it is infamy! A Court where, in deſpight of the right of trial by Juries, property is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by arbitrary ſentence, and where the groſſeſt acts of inquiſitorial Iniquity are daily practiſed; ſuch as private examination of witneſſes, and ſuppreſſion of evidence: and yet this ſcab upon the conſtitution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains uneradicated.</p>
               <p>Sir John Babington, of the Harnham family, acquired the creſt and motto of his coat-armour by a deſperate ſervice under King Henry IV. in France; on his own petition, he was one of ſix young Knights ſent on this duty; and on his leaving the royal preſence, he brandiſhed his ſword, and exclaimed, "Foy eſt tous."<note n="*" place="bottom">The creſt, a dragon's head; from the mouth the words <hi>Foy eſt tous</hi> proceeding.

               <p>Wallington Houſe is a handſome ſtone ſtructure, but from the mode of architecture, doth not ſeem to take its date in this century. Before the ſouth front is a pretty paſture ground, inclining to the brook of Wanſbeck: at the eaſt front is the grand approach, having a circular coach road, with a beautiful green plot, parterres, and flowering ſhrubs: plantations and covered walks cloſe it to the north, and conceal the offices: the gardens ſeem well diſpoſed, on a warm inclination, and the whole makes a pleaſing rural appearance, without any intruſion of coſtly ornaments and laboured works. In the whole compoſition, there is a degree of taſte mixed with a countenance of ruſticity, which characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes an agreeable retirement. Nothing is ſo diſpleaſing to the eye, as temples, pagodas, columns, pyramids, Gothic banquetting-houſes, and modern ruins, jumbled into a few acres, with that confuſion and want of taſte, which over-loaded opulence often diſgorges round a modern villa. True taſte is attached to nature ſo intimately, that each diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by art muſt be made to heighten her beauties, not to diſtort her, and over-burthen the ſcene with a progeny adopted from all the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the earth. A bad ſituation cannot be changed; nay it is not even improved by gorgeous works: a load of edifices is only like finery on a deformed object—but diſpoſe the works of art in a juſt adaption to the ſituation, and in the mode pointed out by nature, and they grow into elegance.</p>
               <p>The nearer proſpect from Wallington over the vale is rich; to the ſouth-eaſt the view is extenſive, though not much variegated: in a clear atmoſphere the ſea is viſible from thence, at the extream of a level not leſs than twenty miles in length.</p>

               <p>commands a fine view of the vale we had paſſed. The aſcent for more than a mile is gradual, and the road in a direct line from Wallington, ſo that the hedge rows form a viſta, terminated by the dome of the offices, which has an agreeable effect. The proſpect here is extenſive and noble; ſome coalworks to the right deform the nearer ground, but all beyond is of that happy compoſition, which cultivation, mixing with natural woods and fanciful plantations, give the landſkip; object decreaſing after object, and ſtretching from the eye till mingled in the azure of the atmoſphere, in which all the horizon lay ſoftened and blended.</p>
               <p>Cambo <note n="†" place="bottom">The name derived from the camp or ſort on the hill.—Wallis.</note> was the ſeat of Sir Robert de Camhoe in the time of King Henry III.</p>
               <p>The way from thence to Rothbury is very crooked, and by croſs roads rendered perplexed. About Wallington we ſaw ſome guide-poſts, but in few other places in the country, and ſeveral of thoſe having been painted, were obliterated, and only mocked our anxiety. Many bridges give eaſy paſſage over the brooks, but their flanks are ſuffered to be walled up or cloſed, ſo that the traveller is deprived of the neceſſary
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0085300201:258"/>
refreſhment for his cattle. The carts were paſſing unmarked, and their drivers inſolent to a high degree.</p>
               <p>We had a view of <hi>Rothbury Caſtle</hi> at the diſtance of ſome miles; the ſituation appeared rugged and uncommon. On the ſide which then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf, we could diſcern diſtinctly no more than the ſquare tower and part of its flankings, placed on a conſiderable eminence, of a rocky and barren aſpect. By not taking the proper road, we were led almoſt round this edifice, which we viewed with no ſmall degree of impatiency. When we came to look upon the northern front, our curioſity was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſlackened, but nevertheleſs we paſſed down the road about half a mile, and having climbed the fence, aſcended the ſteep to the building. The fatigue was but ill recompenſed, for we found this object of our anxious curioſity, no other than an ornamental ſtructure, compoſed of a ſquare tower, flanked with a curvated wall, embattled, and pierced with loop-holes, and each wing terminated with a baſtion: the ſituation romantick, on the brink of a broken precipice. The ſides of this hill, to the weſt and ſouth, preſent a ſhaken and tremendous rocky ſteep, rent into vaſt impending columns and maſſive tables; the ſtones of enormous bulk, in many places hang on each other in ſuch looſe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as if ready to fall into the vale; forming caverns and receſſes, and rude heaps of rocks of a moſt wild and groteſque appearance. To decorate (I preſume) this noble ſcene, the awkward images of a goat and a ſtaring ſtag, delight the paſſing children.—On reſorting to my book of notes, I find they carry the countenance of peeviſhneſs, but as they are juſt, I will tranſcribe them. The ſouthern front opens on a ſmall plain, naturally of a circular form, ſcattered over with huge heads of griffins, broken cornices, and enſigns of Calverly (the lamb and flag of Grace) ſculptured on white free-ſtone; in the midſt of which ſtand two prepoſterous effigies, repreſentative of no known dreſs, perſonage, or people. And to give the coup de grace to this compoſition, enormous ribs, jaw-bones, and members of a whale, are faſtened to the walls for decorations. We entered the tower, in which, by way of tables, are three large rude unhewed ſtones, one in the center, and one in each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at the ſides, benched with ſimilar ſtones: pretty enough for the reception of Thomas of Hick-a-thrift or Jack the Giant-killer.</p>
               <p>We had from this plot one of the moſt extenſive views in Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland. Eaſtward we overlooked the vale which opened upon us at Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, on which many gentlemen's ſeats were ſcattered, mingled with
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0085300201:259"/>
woody plots—very remote objects give little pleaſure to the eye, except what it derives from the diverſity of colouring—the ſea formed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant horizon. To the ſouthward we had a view of Cambo and the hills beyond Wallington, with Mr Delaval's tower, the deformity of which might now be forgot, for the agreeable obeliſk it gave to the proſpect from hence. The weſtern view was more confined, but wholly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and the north frowned in rocks, mountains, and barren heath. In deſcending the hill, a curvated canal preſented itſelf, margined with young plantations, on whoſe border a tent was pitched. This was one of Sir Walter's retreats. The family being there, we did not viſit <hi>Rothly Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We paſſed <hi>Codgey Crag,</hi> a ſtupendous cliff, crowned with another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth ornament, in the ſtile of the former.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable in this paſſage to <hi>Rothbury,</hi> in many parts where we could view a tract country for the diſtance of three or four miles, all conſiſting of cultivated land, the farm-houſes were ſo very diſtant, and the inhabitants few, that for miles we did not perceive a human being in the whole circle. The fields did not engage people in tillage, and the roads were almoſt without paſſengers, ſo that a ſtranger at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, might wander far from the way leading to the place of his deſtination, before he could correct his miſtake. Where tillage is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, and large farms are thrown into graſs, it muſt be the caſe; the country is depopulated, the induſtrious labourer cannot procure bread, and an engroſſing farmer, in a ſtate of indolence, grows opulent by his herds, &amp;c. at the loſs to community, of thoſe members of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in whom the ſtrength of the nation conſiſts, who are, by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable neceſſity, driven to emigrate; an event which will at once ſap the ſtate, and impoveriſh the ſubject. Boys who would otherwiſe have been employed in huſbandry, are bound out to manufactories; our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers are grown more numerous than trade can maintain; the huſbandman's labour is not wanted, his hands are ſhifted to a different employ; and the hardy race of Britons are ſunk into a ſtate of imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and reduced to the languid and meagre ſhadows of men, who hang upon the loom. The difficulty of recruiting the army and manning the navy will every day increaſe—the reſources are taken away. Not one-fourth part of the number of families are employed in huſbandry in the north, there was forty years ago. This was a nurſery for the army and the fleet. The enlarging farms, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0085300201:260"/>
reducing the tillage, is a capital error, which though ſlow in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, yet is as ſure as fate. Subſtituting the horſe for the ox in huſbandry, is a miſtaken maxim, which for a temporary profit has crept in upon us: the ox was advancing in value, and increaſing the ſupply of the market as he laboured: the horſe takes twice the maintenance, conſuming a vaſt portion of grain, and his price is ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yearly into nothing. Not expoſing the neceſſaries of life in open market, is another matter that prejudices the poor, by increaſing prices; an artificial ſcarcity is thereby much eaſier to be effected. I am bold to ſay, that if a law was made to oblige plowing by oxen, and to enforce every article of the farmer to be brought to open market to be ſold within a limitted time, we ſhould experience much greater plenty. Of my own knowledge, wheat, (when 6s. 6d. the Wincheſter buſhel) in immenſe quantities, has been kept up till ſpoiled, and made fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hogs. I cannot avoid adopting Mr Pennant's ſentiments on a view of the like kind. Speaking of his entry into Northumberland at Cornhill, he ſays, <q>All this country is open, deſtitute of trees, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt even of hedges; for hedges are in their infancy in theſe parts, as it is not above ſeven or eight years ſince they have been introduced —the land is fertile, ſwells into gentle riſings, and is rich in corn. It is miſerably depopulated; a few great farm-houſes and hamlets ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear rarely ſcattered over the vaſt tracts. There are few farms of leſs value than 150l. a year. They are generally three, four, or five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and I heard of one poſſeſſed by a ſingle family, that even reached twenty-five hundred: in this was a ſingle field of 3000 acres, and which took 600 bolls of ſeed wheat, of ſix Wincheſter buſhels each. A humour fatal to the commonwealth prevails over many parts of the north, of flinging numbers of ſmall tenements into a large one, in order to ſave the expence of building; or perhaps to avoid the multiplicity of receipts, lay a whole country into a ſheep walk. Theſe devour poor men's houſes, and expel the ancient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants from their fire-ſides, to ſeek their bread in a ſtrange land. I have heard of a character (I forgot the ſpot it curſes) that is too bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and infamous to be overlooked; which has ſo little feeling, as to depopulate a village of 200 ſouls, and to level their houſes to the ground; to deſtroy eight or ten farm-houſes on an eſtate of 1000l. a year, for the ſake of turning almoſt the whole into a ſheep walk.— There he lives, and there he may long live his own tormentor! deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deteſted by all mankind.

places, are now ſcarcely inhabited. The laſt formerly a great market town, is now reduced to a ſingle farm-houſe. The inhabitants have long ſince been diſperſed, forced to exchange the wholſome, the vigorous, the innocent lives of the rural oeconomiſts, for the ſickly ſhort-lived employs of manufacturers in Birmingham and other great towns, where diſeaſe, and often corrupted morals, cauſe double the conſumption of people as would happen were they permitted to enjoy their ancient ſeats. The want of labourers begins to be ſenſibly felt. As a proof, they are retained by the year; and policy dictates to their employers the affording them good wages: each has his cottage, a a piece of land gratis, and a ſhilling a day in ſummer and ten-pence in winter. I call this good pay, in a country which ought to be very cheap; if not, what are the fine effects of the great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? The Spectator ſpeaks much of the deſerts of the man that raiſes two ears of corn where one grew before. But who will point out the man who has the ſoul to make his poor brethren feel the happy effects of his art? I believe, that at preſent there are numbers who have raiſed ten for one that were known a few years ago. It would be natural to ſuppoſe that plenty would introduce cheapneſs; but till the providential plenty of the preſent year, corn was exactly double the value of what it was 14 years paſt. Yet the plenty of money has not been found doubled by the poor manufacturer or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer. The land owner in the north hath taken full care of himſelf. A farm of 75l. per annum 20 years ago, has been lately ſet for 365l. Another of 230l. will be ſoon ſet for 1000l. per annum. An eſtate was bought in 1759 for 6800l. it conſiſted of 1560 acres, of which 750 have been ſold for 8400l. and all theſe improvements reſult from the unprincipled and iniquitous notion, of making the buyer of the produce pay not only to ſatisfy the demand of the landlord, but to enable the farmer to make a princely fortune, and to live with a luxury the ſhame of the times. They have loſt the reſpectable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Old Engliſh Yeomanry, by too cloſe an imitation of the extravagant follies of their betters.</q>

               <p>the whole country in view, conſiſting of rocky ſteeps, lofty hills crowned with heath, and others compoſed of nothing but naked ſtones: a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous and rugged proſpect, dreary and deſolate. The breez which broke up the vale from the north-weſt, afforded us the true effect, which under the deſcriptive phraſe of "howling in the wilderneſs," had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore conveyed to my mind an image rather poetically extravagant than true: but here it was juſtly deſcriptive, for as it paſſed over the naked ſteeps and rugged cliffs, its ſound could not be deſcribed by any other expreſſion.</p>
               <p>We deſcended into this deſolate vale, down a very ſteep and ſtony road, barrenneſs and rocks on every hand; but on paſſing a little projecting eminence, were agreeably ſurprized by the opening of the hills, and it was not long before we had a ſight of Whitton Tower, and ſoon after Rothbury preſented itſelf, ſeated in the neck of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cultivated glen; a ſituation perfectly ſequeſtered, and ſecure from ſtorms: ſome pretty fields opening to the ſouth-weſt, where the valley is enlarged.</p>

The other ſides contain rich ornamental ſculpture, of fancy figures interwoven with foliage; ſuch as are ſeen upon the obeliſk in Bewcaſtle church-yard, in Cumberland.

The keepers are obliged to ſhoot them, if any are wanted: if the beaſt is not killed on the ſpot, it runs at the perſon who gave the wound, and who is forced, in order to ſave himſelf, to fly for ſafety to the intervention of ſome tree.</p>
               <p>"Theſe cattle are of a middle ſize, have very long legs, and the cows are fine horned: the orbits of the eyes and the tips of the noſes are black; but the bulls have loſt the manes attributed to them by Boethius."</p>

               <p>This is a deplorable part of the country for a ſtranger to be benighted in; the heavy vapours which frequently envelope the hills the whole day, as frequently attend the advance of night into the vale, as it happened to us, and brings on a darkneſs truly to be felt; whilſt there there is no houſe, inhabitant, or paſſenger, for miles, to direct your way.</p>
               <p>We were thankful when we gained ſight of the Inn at Wooler Haugh; the court-yard, which we deſcended into from the road, was crowded indeed with waggons and carriages, and the lights in the ſtables ſhewed there were ſeveral gueſts in the houſe, but of what quality and denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we could not divine. When we alighted, the hoſtler looked to be in ſome confuſion; but we did not deviſe the reaſon, being willing not to premiſe any thing to our diſadvantage at that time of night, in the rain, and in a country not known to any of us. We were met by a jolly hoſteſs at the door, who deſired us, with all the courteſy of a civil publican, to walk in. We were introduced to the kitchen, and required to air our cloaths, till the people got lights and prepared a room. It was now time to conſider the ſcene; the kitchen ſmelled rank of cooking, for there was as much buſtle, as if they were preparing a hecatomb: the room was populous to a degree, for the miſtreſs and two jolly nymphs her daughters ſtickled in the cookery, whilſt there went backward and forward, in and out, hoſtlers, livery ſervants, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, and ſavages of various denominations, in the utmoſt confuſion; carrying, ſeeking, fetching, or calling for innumerable matters, like the confuſion of Babel, in the greateſt agitation and emergency. When
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0085300201:276"/>
we had leiſure to think, we were at a loſs to conceive what had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned this hurricane, in which we had ſo awkwardly involved our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at this little houſe under a hill, in the wilds of Wooler; but outward objects embarraſſed all thinking to that degree, that our minds remained overwhelmed in what the eye communicated, or what diſtracted the ear; and like fellows that were faſcinated, we forbore to make our eſcape. The table was covered with mangled joints of victuals; above us, before us, on this hand and on that, was the noiſe of tumultuous companies, creating that diſcordance of ſounds; which diſtracts an Inn at a fair;—hallowing, laughing, ringing of bells, beating on tables, menaces, oaths, female titterations, and muſic were in the compoſition. My companion in a whiſper ſays, "Where the devil have we got to?" I would have told him, if it had been in my power: I found myſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally embarraſſed, till at length this horrid diſcordance rouzed me, and on expreſſing uneaſineſs at not being ſhewn to our apartment, we were told the room was clearing of its preſent poſſeſſors, who were going to bed. Startled at ſuch intelligence, we began to doubt what would be our accommodations, and that we might have occaſion to diſplace the ſame race of viſitants a ſecond time, before we could poſſeſs any beds: in defiance of the weather, a night as dark as Erebus, and a road unknown, we thought it more prudent to ſet forward for Wooler town, diſtant near two miles; and accordingly left this place to the ſportſmen who occupied it on their moor ſhooting parties, and to the carriers and horrid wretches who barricadoed it without.</p>
               <p>At the Black Bull Inn, in Wooler, we ended the anxieties of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in comfortable lodgings, and every accommodation a traveller could hope for.</p>

town, are the remains of a tower, apparently as ancient as the time of the Muſchamps. By the eſcheats of the reign of King Richard II. it appears there was an Hoſpital here dedicated to Mary Magdalen. In the neighbourhood of Wooler are ſeveral intrenchments and kairns; one at a place called Cattle Well, which has the name of Maiden Caſtle, and another, a very conſiderable one, at Trodden Gares.</p>
               <p>Wooler is ſituate to the eaſt of Cheviots, in an ill cultivated country, under the influence of vaſt mountains, from whence it is ſubject to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous rains. It is a place of great reſort in the ſummer months, for invalids to drink goats milk or whey. The church is placed on a fine eminence, and having been lately rebuilt, is commodious. It is ſaid the mother church was at Fenton, on the eaſt ſide of the river Till, now totally in ruins.</p>
               <p>Our amuſement in the ſucceeding morning was among ſuch hills, as have ſeldom been thought acceſſable by parties of pleaſure. By Humbledon Burn, on an eaſy inclination, is an intrenchment called Green Caſtle; and on Humbledon Hugh, about a mile to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt of Wooler, is a circular intrenchment, with a large kairn. The ſide of the hill is cut in various terraces, riſing above each other. This ſeems to have been calculated for a temporary fort, and the mode gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally practiſed in ancient times in this part of the country. Many of thoſe terraces are formed with great exactneſs, about 20 feet in breadth. In ſome places there are three of thoſe flights or terraces; in others I obſerved five, placed in regular gradations, one above the other. Theſe were outworks of an important nature, to defend a body of Chiefs, or a valuable booty, which occupied the crown of a hill. The original mode I preſume was Daniſh, though thoſe works are properly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Scotch and Engliſh before the battle in 1402. The ſummit of a hill being levelled, I conceive received the officers of higheſt rank and the moſt valuable effects of the camp; to which the platforms riſing above each other, and encircling the hill, when filled with troops would make a powerful defence.</p>
               <p>In the plain beneath is a ſtone pillar, denoting the ground where 10,000 of the Scots, under Earl Douglas, in the reign of King Henry IV. on Holy-rood-day, 1402, had a great overthrow, by Henry Lord Percy and George Earl of March. Douglas's forces had poſſeſſed the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, but his paſſage into Scotland being intercepted by Earl Percy,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0085300201:278"/>
he was obliged to engage on this plain: the battle was ſo bloody, that the lands gained the name of Redriggs, from the ſlaughter with which they were ſtained. According to Hollingſhead, among the priſoners were the Earls of Fife, Murray, Angus, Athol, Orkney, and Monteath, the Lords Montgomery and Erſkine, and about 80 Knights. Douglas received five wounds and loſt an eye. Being hotly purſued, in the flight 500 Scots were drowned in Tweed, the moſt of their army on this fatal day dying or being priſoners.</p>
               <p>The diſpoſition of the Engliſh, was chiefly on an oppoſite mount to that occupied by the Scotch, except their archers, who were arranged on the plain. The Scots were ſo galled by the flights of arrows, to which we may preſume they were extremely expoſed, if marſhalled on thoſe terraces before deſcribed, that they grew impatient of reſtraint, and with their whole force deſcended into the plain, to come to cloſer battle. The Engliſh alſo advanced, their archers retiring in well compacted bodies, to admit the other troops into the line, at the ſame time diſcharging ſuch flights of arrows, as no armour could reſiſt, and thereby the Scots were ſoon broken and thrown into confuſion. Sir John Swinton and Adam Gordon ſeveral times rallied flying parties, and renewed the battle with the greateſt bravery, till they fell among the ſlain. Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians mention no perſon of note on the ſide of the Engliſh who was ſlain that day, the victory being entirely the work of the archers, the other troops being ſaid not to have engaged.</p>

This houſe was in the time of the ſucceeding Kings neglected, and another made for it, in a place called Melnim, now Melfold."</p>
               <p>Thus it appears this was a Manor of the Saxon Kings, and was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of King Edwin and his Queen Ethelburga, after his converſion by Paulinus. This Edwin was afterwards ſlain by Penda and Cedwall, two Tributaries: Ethelburga eſcaped to her brother, Eadbald King of Kent, by whom Paulinus was made Biſhop of Rocheſter. There are not the leaſt remains of any conſiderable ſtructure here, or any thing to denote that a royal palace once exiſted on the ſpot.</p>
               <p>The ancient name of Ad-Gebrin, through the aſſiſtance of Mr Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's etymologies, alſo leads me to determine this was a royal reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and had one of thoſe high places conſecrated to the worſhip of the Sun. <q>

They repreſent them as very knowing and enterprizing; and with good reaſon. They were the firſt who ventured upon the ſeas and took long voyages. They ſhewed their ſuperiority and addreſs in the numberleſs expeditions which they made, and the difficulties which they ſurmounted. Many have thought that they were colonies from Egypt or from Phoenicia; having a regard only to the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they made in the weſt. But I ſhall ſhew hereafter, that colonies of the ſame people are to be found in the moſt extreme parts of the eaſt; where we may obſerve the ſame rites and ceremonies, and the ſame traditional hiſtories, as are to be met with in their other ſettlements. The country called Phoenicia could not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for the effecting all that is attributed to theſe mighty adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. It is neceſſary for me to acquaint the reader, that the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people to whom I allude, were the the deſcendants of <hi>Chus,</hi> and called <hi>Cuthites</hi> and <hi>Cuſeans.</hi> They ſtood their ground at the general migration of families; but were at laſt ſcattered over the face of the earth. They were the firſt apoſtates from the truth: yet great in worldly wiſdom. They introduced where ever they came many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arts, and were looked up to as a ſuperior order of beings: hence they were ſtiled <hi>Heroes, Daemons, Heliadae, Macarians.</hi> They were joined in their expeditions by other nations, eſpecially by the colateral branches of their family, the <hi>Mizraim, Caphtorim,</hi> and the ſons of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Theſe were all of the line of <hi>Ham,</hi> who was held by his poſterity in the higheſt veneration. They called him <hi>Amon,</hi> and having in proceſs of time raiſed him to a divinity, they worſhipped him as the Sun: and from this worſhip they were ſtyled <hi>Amonians.</hi> This therefore will be the title, by which I ſhall chooſe to diſtinguiſh the people of whom I treat, when I ſpeak of them collectively; for under this denomination are included all of this family, whether they were <hi>Egyptians</hi> or <hi>Syrians,</hi> of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> or of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </q> To this I will add, what a celebrated French author (treating of the riſe and progreſs of arts and ſciences) ſays, touching the migrations of theſe Eaſterns, to attempt at leaſt a colourable propoſition, touching the time Britain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thoſe viſitants, if not a concluſive one. <q>When we ſpeak of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> we muſt diſtinguiſh the times with accuracy. Theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple poſſeſſed originally a large extent of countries, compriſed under
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0085300201:281"/>
the name of the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> They loſt the greateſt part of it, by the conqueſts of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under <hi>Joſhua.</hi> The lands which fell in diviſion to the tribe of <hi>Aſher,</hi> extended to <hi>Sidon;</hi> that city notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was not ſubdued. If the conqueſts of <hi>Joſhua</hi> took from the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> a great part of their dominion, they were well paid by the conſequences of that event. In effect the greateſt part of the ancient inhabitants of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> ſeeing themſelves threatened with entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, had recourſe to flight to ſave themſelves. <hi>Sidon</hi> offered them an aſylum. By this eruption of the Hebrew people, the <hi>Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were enabled to ſend colonies where ever they thought proper. <hi>Sidon</hi> lent them ſhips, and made good uſe of theſe new inhabitants, to extend their trade and form ſettlements. From hence that great number of colonies, which went from <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> to ſpread themſelves in all the countries of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> We may date this event, about the year of the world 2553, and 1451 years before Chriſt. <hi>Spain</hi> was not the only country beyond the <hi>pillars of Hercules,</hi> which the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> penetrated. Being familiarized with the navigation of the ocean, they extended themſelves to the left of the Straits of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> as well as to the right. <hi>Strabo</hi> aſſures us, that theſe people had gone over a part of the weſtern coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> a little time after the war of <hi>Troy.</hi> We might perhaps determine their paſſage into <hi>England,</hi> by a reflection which the reading of the writers of antiquity furniſhes us with: they are perſuaded that all the <hi>Tin</hi> that was conſumed in the known world came from the Iſles of <hi>Caſſitorides;</hi> and there is no doubt thoſe Iſles were the <hi>Sorlingues</hi> and a part of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> We ſee by the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that in his time <hi>Tin</hi> was known in <hi>Paleſtine. Homer</hi> teaches us alſo that they made uſe of this metal in the heroic ages. It ſhould follow then, that the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> had traded in <hi>Britain</hi> in very remote antiquity.</q>—After giving the reader theſe opinions of two au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors highly diſtinguiſhed in the literary world, I muſt proceed to the application.</p>
               <p>Near <hi>Yevering</hi> is a place known by the name of <hi>Yevering Bell,</hi> a lofty mountain, one of the north-weſt Cheviots, of an oblong figure, ariſing to a cone. The name is ſuppoſed, by the inhabitants of the country, to be derived from the figure of the hill; and conſequently as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to any other of like form as this, of which there are many among the Cheviots. We aſcended the mountain from <hi>Yevering,</hi> by winding round its ſide to the ſouth and eaſt, the only means of climbing to the top, which was not attained without great labour, from the ſteepneſs of
<pb facs="tcp:0085300201:282"/>
                  <figure/>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0085300201:283"/>
the aſcent, the height of the <hi>Bell</hi> being upwards 2000 perpendicular feet, taken from the plain at <hi>Yevering.</hi> The ſummit of the mountain is almoſt level, encinctured with the remains of a wall, placed on the brink of the ſteep, which when entire was of conſiderable ſtrength, as appears from the materials. The wall has been built without mortar, of large flat ſtones, with which the country abounds. This wall forms and incloſes an area of 1000 paces in circumference; the entrance is on the ſouth ſide. The breadth of the ruins of the wall on a medium is eight yards; and by the ſtones on the ſurface, it may be computed that there are about four fothers of ſtones to the yard. It aſtoniſhes the ſpectator, on viewing theſe remains, when he computes that 4000 fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of ſtones, at leaſt, were employed in this erection, and thoſe borne by human hands, to a place totally inacceſſable by carriages or cattle bearing burthens. It may be alledged indeed, that in a plot of ground 1000 paces in circumference many ſtones might be won; but the crown of the hill doth in no wiſe encourage ſuch a conjecture; the ground wearing altogether a natural countenance, no rocks or quarries appearing within the area to furniſh ſuch a vaſt quantity of ſtone, and where the turf is broken, a ſmall gravel appears. The eaſtern end of the area riſes ſome few feet from the level of the plain. Taking our courſe by the wall before deſcribed, at a point almoſt due eaſt, a broad way appeared, three paces wide in a ſtraight direction, as if formed by an even pavement, extending about 30 yards in aſcent towards the crown of the hill. We found this eminence ſurrounded by the remains of another wall, but conſiſting of fewer materials, in an exact circle, 180 paces in circumference, with a ditch within. Near the center of this inner area, rather inclining to the eaſt, is a kairn of ſtones, of no very great height, ariſing about 10 paces in an eaſy aſcent from the level of the inner wall. The center of the kairn is hollow like a baſon, ſix paces from brim to brim. After removing the turf and ſoil for a little depth, we found the ſtones reduced to a ſort of <hi>calx,</hi> and every where retaining a ſtrong impreſſion of fire. The view from this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is very extenſive, it affords a proſpect of near 20 miles north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into Scotland, and over Northumberland many miles to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt; an opening of the mountains on that ſide, and an extenſive plain to the northward, giving it that great command of proſpect. As a beacon hill it was fortunately placed; as a place of heatheniſh worſhip, it was conſpicuous from many points of view, where the ſacrificial rites might be diſcovered, and thereby the people called to worſhip. On the northern ſide of the mountain, are the remains of a foreſt
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0085300201:284"/>
or extenſive grove of oaks; a circumſtance, not to be found, or at leaſt not diſcovered by us, on any of the hills within view from the ſummit of Yevering Bell. On many parts of the ſides of the hill are the remains of circular buildings, but now ſo totally ruined, and the ſtones ſo ſcattered, that their former conſequence or uſe are not to be diſcovered, little more than the form of the foundations remaining. Several of them I took to be no other than folds for encloſing a number of ſheep or cattle, the ruins not containing materials ſufficient for any large erection.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Wallis a account of this remarkable place, is looſe and unſatisfactory. <q>About two hundred yards weſt from this Column, is a high hill called Yevering Bell, from its bell-like ſhape; the top of an oblong figure; a Kairn on the eaſt ſide, with a circular Trench; many circular foundations of buildings upon the ſides or ſlopes of both; the whole encompaſſed with a Wall of Whinſtone of a great breadth and length, fallen down by age and tempeſts; the work ſeemingly of the Pagan Danes, for their Prieſtoood and Nobles to aſſemble on, for legiſlation, for devotion, and ſepulture.</q>
                  </note> The works on this mount appear to me of very remote antiquity, and in attempting to explain their nature, I will conſider them ſingly, and furniſh the reader with all the lights I have collected; as I preſume they are ſo ſingular as to attract the attention of travellers who may hereafter traverſe this country in ſearch of antiquities. In the firſt place, we will conſider this object in the manner it would naturally call for a ſtranger's attention. It cannot be conceived, from the loftineſs of the mountain, the extreme difficulty of acceſs, the coldneſs of that high region, and the inclemency of weather it is naturally ſubject to, to have been uſed as a place of ſtrength: from theſe natural cauſes alſo, it is not probable it ſhould be uſed as a place for ſecuring cattle and flocks againſt the incurſions of an enemy: it may reaſonably, from its very nature, be admitted to be uſed for religious offices. If uſed as a beacon only, then whence the neceſſity of theſe circumvallations? It has been conceived by ſome,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr Wallis in his Antiquities of Northumberland.</note> that it was poſſeſſed by the Danes, and that theſe works appertained to that people, who here held their civil and religious conventions. Kairns, placed on ſuch immenſe eminences, if marks of ſepulture, muſt denote the place of interment of remarkable perſonages, and thoſe too who did not die by the ſword; for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cuſtom of the ancient inhabitants of this land, who raiſed a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus over the dead, appears to have been that of interring them where they were ſlain. The circular buildings, if appropriations to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of juſtice, muſt have been adapted to ſeveral and ſeparate miniſters; a thing ſcarcely probable. If to the miniſtring of religious
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0085300201:285"/>
rites, or to ſepulture, then indeed the inconſiſtency ceaſes. The interior circumvallation appears calculated for the excluſion of the vulgar, from the principal ſcene of religious rites, where the prieſts and chief perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages only miniſtred. The wall which forms the grand encloſure of the whole crown of the mountain, includes 16 acres and a half, or very near it, and would contain a prodigious number of people.</p>
               <p>In this wild and mountainous country, the names and marks of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity have eſcaped thoſe changes which naturally follow cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it is in ſuch parts we are to ſearch for the evidences of the moſt remote antiquity exiſting in this kingdom. It is certain the Druids, though they built temples and paid their adoration towards the Sun, always retained ſuch diſtinction in their worſhip, that they looked up to the great Luminary as the Throne, or as the ſymbol and archetype only of the Divinity; which they confeſſed, created and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the univerſe, and was the ſole ſpirit of exiſtence. It will not follow, that this purity was retained by all the inhabitants of the ſame land, or the ſame mode of worſhip gained an univerſal acceptation among them; many appointed for themſelves places for private adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and theſe eminences were moſt aſſuredly the choſen ſpots for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votees, who paying their worſhip to the Sun, might loſs the ſymbolical character, and confounded with ignorance and ſuperſtition, forget the archetype for the object. The name of <hi>Bel</hi> authorizes me to preſume this place was ſacred to the Sun, it being derived from the <hi>Chaldean</hi> language, and ſignifying the Sun. Mr Bryant ſays, <q>many worſhipped upon hills, and on the tops of high mountains, imagining that they thereby obtained a nearer communication with heaven. This prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in early times was almoſt univerſal, and every mountain was eſteemed holy. The people who retired to eminences, fancied that they were brought into the vicinity of the powers of the air, and the Deity who reſided in the higher regions. But the chief excellence for which they were frequented, was the <hi>Omphi,</hi> the <hi>Vox divina,</hi> being eſteemed a particular revelation from heaven. In ſhort, they looked upon them as the peculiar places, where God delivered his oracles. The word <hi>Omphi,</hi> ſignifying the <hi>Oracle of Ham,</hi> who, according to the <hi>Egygtian theology,</hi> was the ſame as the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Oſiris,</hi> he was likewiſe revered as the chief Deity of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and by moſt of the nations of the Eaſt:</q>—Having thus ſhewn the choice made by the Ancients of high places, for their adoration, I will next conſider the name of this place, according to the <hi>etymologies</hi> laid down by Mr Bryant.</p>

                     </gap> or <hi>Lord,</hi> and is often found compounded with other terms; as <hi>Bel-Hamon,</hi> and alſo <hi>Bel-Shamaim,</hi> the <hi>great Lord of the heavens.</hi> This was a title given by the <hi>Syrians</hi> to the <hi>Sun.</hi> By <hi>Gib</hi> is meant an hill. <hi>Gibeon</hi> was the hill of the <hi>Sun.

               </p>
               <p>As to the kairn, which I mentioned to be ſituate on the eaſtern point of the area, on the crown of the mount, which is a conical pile, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating obtuſely, and baſoned as before deſcribed, I preſume its name to be derived from <q>
                     <hi>Keren,</hi> which (according to Mr Bryant) ſignifies in its original ſenſe <hi>a Horn;</hi> but it was a title of the <hi>Sun</hi> himſelf: for <hi>Apollo</hi> was named <hi>Carneus;</hi> which was no other than <hi>Cereneus,</hi> the <hi>ſupreme Deity,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Light.</hi> The Prieſt of <hi>Cybele,</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> was ſtiled <hi>Carnas,</hi> which was a title of the Deity whom he ſerved.</q> Whence it is deducible, that our <hi>kairn</hi> on the ſummit of this mount, was the place of the altar, where religious rites were performed in the fire worſhip. And the like may be conceived of all thoſe conical mounts called <hi>kairns,</hi> they being a corruption of "<hi>Kir-on,</hi> the place of the <hi>Sun.</hi>" In forming theſe <hi>kairns,</hi> as well the preſent one as others we viſited in this neighbourhood, and one in particular on the crown of one of the higheſt mountains above <hi>Newton,</hi> called <hi>Newton Weſt Tor,</hi> the ſtones muſt have been carried up by a multitude of hands, with immenſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Suppoſe by the dimenſions of one of theſe <hi>kairns,</hi> which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured near 40 paces in circumference, that there was contained therein 300 carriage loads of pebbles; we will find the computation of labour and hands to be immenſe, for the conſtruction thereof, when all the materials muſt be borne two miles of ſteep aſcent to this amazing accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. I was induced to believe I ſhould diſcover ſome hearth ſtone or altar on the crown of ſome of the <hi>kairns,</hi> but was diſappointed. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps time and the abhorrence which grew up with Converſion againſt the rites of the heathen, had removed the ſuperſtructure, if any ſuch there had been. There was not one of the <hi>kairns</hi> I viſited had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0085300201:287"/>
hollow baſon, but that on the <hi>Bell,</hi> which was exactly circular, but compoſed of ſtones of a ſmall ſize, as far as I ſearched. On my view, I was immediately perſuaded that all theſe accumulations called <hi>kairns,</hi> ſituated on mountains and high places, had not proceeded from a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of honouring the dead, but were formed by zealots, who attending their worſhip, carried with them progreſſively a burthen, to add to the grandeur, loftineſs, and immenſity of the ſacred place, where they paid their adoration. The <hi>kairn</hi> on <hi>Yevering</hi> is to the <hi>eaſt,</hi> an object regarded in the ſtructures of the ancient Britons, in the remoteſt antiquity, and by the Eaſterns, in erections of the like uſe. Theſe places have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their ancient forms, and their firſt names uncorrupted, by reaſon of the mountainous nature of the country. Where cultivation cannot advance, things of this ſort muſt reſt for ages unchanged: it has been the caſe here. Beſides, the inhabitants are few, and thoſe ſubſiſting on the extreme verge of poverty, hourly employed in procuring a ſcanty ſubſiſtence. Add to this the depopulations which war for many ages occaſioned, would prevent thoſe alterations which take place in times of peace. Mr Bryant ſays, <q>The people of <hi>Cappadocia and Pontus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the like method of worſhip: and of all ſacrifices whatever, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited upon high places, none perhaps ever equalled in magnificence, that which was offered by Mithridates, upon his war with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. He followed the <hi>Perſic</hi> modes of worſhip, as well as the mixed rites of the <hi>Chaldeans and Syrians.</hi> Hence he choſe one of the higheſt mountains in his dominions; upon the top of which he reared an immenſe pile, equal in ſize to the ſummit on which it ſtood; and there he ſacrificed to the God of <hi>Armies.</hi> The pile was raiſed by his vaſſal Princes: and the offerings, beſides thoſe cuſtomary, were <hi>wine, honey, oil,</hi> and every ſpecies of <hi>aromatics.</hi> The fire is ſaid to have been perceived at the diſtance of near a thouſand ſtadia.</q> So much muſt ſuffice, on this point, and in this place, from innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances produced by this learned author.</p>
               <p>My next enquiry will be, touching the circumvallation which appears on <hi>Yevering Bell;</hi> to ſhew that this was a practice with the Ancients, on their conſecrated hills. Mr Bryant ſays, <q>The <hi>Helladians</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> were of the ſame family: hence we find many ſimilar rites ſubſiſting among the two nations. The latter adhered to the purer <hi>Zabaiſm,</hi> which they maintained a long time. They erected the ſame ſacred <hi>Tupha</hi> (or Tumulus) as the <hi>Grecians:</hi> and we may be aſſured of the original purpoſe for which theſe hills were raiſed, from the uſe to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0085300201:288"/>
which they put them. They were dedicated to <hi>the great Fountain of Light,</hi> called by the <hi>Perſians, Anait;</hi> and were ſet apart as <hi>puratheia,</hi> for the celebration of the rites of <hi>fire.</hi> This people, after they had defeated the <hi>Sacae</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> raiſed an immenſe <hi>Comah,</hi> in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of their victory. <hi>Strabo,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 1. p. 779.</note> who deſcribes it very minutely, tells us, that they choſe a convenient ſpot, where they reared a <hi>Petra,</hi> or <hi>high place,</hi> by heaping up a vaſt mound of earth. This they faſhioned to <hi>a conical figure,</hi> and then ſurrounded it <hi>with a wall of ſtone.</hi> In this manner they founded a temple, in honour of <hi>Anait.</hi> I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had hills of this nature, and from them the cuſtom was tranſmitted to <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </q>

               <p>The circular buildings mentioned to appear on the ſides of the mount, will be the laſt objects which require my attention, before I draw my general concluſion. I confeſs they did not appear to me ſo remarkable as to require taking any admeaſurement; but they are ſpoken of by Mr Wallis, as being very ſingular, and as I did not traverſe all the ſides of the mountain, perhaps thoſe of greater conſequence eſcaped my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; but conceiving that they may be marks of antiquity, among other matters, I will treſpaſs upon the reader with deſcriptions of thoſe circular buildings in the northern parts of this iſland, which have been viſited by learned travellers; and perhaps ſome future viſitor of the Cheviots may be induced to make a narrower ſearch, and more correct inveſtigation. But before I proceed thereto, I will conſider ſome others of Mr Bryant's opinions, which relate generally to my ſubject of <hi>Yever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bell,</hi> and particularly to the circular remains.</p>
               <p>Mr Bryant informs, <q>that theſe mounts were not only in <hi>Greece,</hi> but in <hi>Egypt, Syria,</hi> and moſt parts of the world. They were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally formed by art, being compoſed of earth raiſed very high; which was ſloped gradually, and with great exactneſs: and the top of all was crowned with <hi>a fair tower.</hi> The ſituation of theſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings made them be looked upon as places of great ſafety: and the reverence in which they were held, added to the ſecurity. On theſe accounts they were the repoſitories of much wealth and treaſure: in times of peril they were crowded with things of value. In <hi>Aſſyria</hi> was a temple named <hi>Azara,</hi> which the <hi>Parthian</hi> plundered, and is
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0085300201:289"/>
ſaid to have carried off ten thouſand talents. To ſuch as theſe <hi>Solomon</hi> alludes, when he makes his beloved ſay, <hi>'I am a wall, and my breaſts like towers.'</hi> Though the word <hi>Cumah</hi> or <hi>Comah,</hi> be generally ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a wall; yet I ſhould think, that in this place it ſignified the ground, which the wall ſurrounded: an incloſure ſacred to <hi>Cham,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> who was particularly worſhipped in ſuch places. Another paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>Solomon: 'We have a little ſiſter, and ſhe hath no breaſts. If ſhe be a Comah, we will build upon her a palace of ſilver.'</hi> What is then termed a wall, was a <hi>Comah</hi> or <hi>high place,</hi> which had been of old erected to the <hi>Sun,</hi> by the <hi>Jebuſites.</hi> The ground ſet apart for ſuch uſe was generally <hi>oval;</hi> and towards one extremity of the long dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, as it were in the focus, were theſe <hi>mounds and towers</hi> erected. For there were many of theſe <hi>towers,</hi> where they taught <hi>aſtronomy, muſic,</hi> and other <hi>ſciences.</hi> Theſe places were likewiſe <hi>courts of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> where juſtice was adminiſtred.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In Mr Pennant's Voyage to the Hebrides, we have the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of erections of this kind, near Inverneſs. <q>Viſit the celebrated edifices attributed to the <hi>Danes:</hi> the firſt is placed about two miles from the mouth of the valley of <hi>Glen Elg.</hi> The more entire ſide ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of a moſt elegant taper form: the preſent height is thirty feet ſix inches; but in 1722, ſome Goth purloined from the top ſeven feet and a half, under pretence of applying the materials to certain public buildings. By the appearance of ſome ruins that now lie at the baſe, and which have fallen off ſince that time, I believe three feet more may be added to the height, which will make the whole about forty-one feet.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The whole is built with dry walls, but the courſes moſt beautifully diſpoſed. On one ſide is a breach of at leaſt one quarter of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. The diameter within is thirty-three feet and a half, taken at the diſtance of ten feet from the bottom: the wall in that part is ſeven feet four inches thick, but is formed thinner and thinner till it reaches the top, whoſe breadth I forgot to cauſe to be meaſured. The inſide wall is quite perpendicular, ſo that the inner diameter muſt have been equal from top to bottom: but the exterior wall ſlopes, increaſing in thickneſs till it reaches the ground.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the thickneſs of the wall were two galleries, one at the lower part; about ſix feet two inches high, and two feet five wide at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0085300201:290"/>
narrowing to the top, flagged and alſo covered over with great flat ſtones. This gallery ran quite round, and that horizontally, but was divided into apartments: in one place with ſix flags placed equidiſtant from each other, and were acceſſible above by means of a hole from another gallery. Into the lower were two entrances, (before the ruin of the other ſide there had been two others) above each of theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances were a row of holes, running up to the top, divided by flags, appearing like ſhelves: near the top was a circle of projecting ſtones, which probably were intended to hold the beams that formed the roof: above is another hole like the former. None of theſe openings paſs through, for there is not the leaſt appearance of window or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the outſide wall. All theſe holes are ſquare; are too ſmall to admit the human body, ſo were probably deſigned to lodge arms, and different other matters, ſecure from wet or harm.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Over the firſt gallery was another, divided from it only by flags. This alſo went round, but was free from any ſeparation; the height was five feet ſix; only twenty inches wide at bottom. This was alſo covered with flags at top.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>At a diſtance above, in the broken ſides of the wall, was another hole, but it ſeemed too ſmall for a gallery. The aſcent was not ſafe, ſo could not venture up. The height was taken by a little boy who ſcrambled to the top.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The entrance was a ſquare hole on the weſt ſide: before it were the remains of ſome building, with a narrow opening that led to the door. Almoſt contiguous to this entrance or portico, was a ſmall circle formed of rude ſtones, which was called the foundation of the Druids houſes. It probably was formed for ſome religious purpoſe. I was told there were many others of this kind ſcattered over the valley.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>At leſs than a quarter of a mile diſtant from this, ſtands the ſecond tower on a little flat on the ſide of the hill. The form is ſimilar, but the number of galleries differs: here are three; the loweſt goes entirely round; but at the eaſt end is an aperture now of ſmall depth, but once of ſuch extent, that the goats which ſheltered in it were often loſt: on that account the entrance was filled with ſtones. This is ſix feet high, four feet two inches broad, and flagged above and below.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0085300201:291"/>
                  <q>A ſecond gallery was of the ſame height, but the breadth of the floor only three feet five.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The third gallery was of ſuch difficult acceſs, that I did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to get up: it was ſo narrow and ſo low, that it was with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that the child who climbed to it could creep through.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The preſent height of this tower is only twenty-four feet five inches, the diameter thirty: the thickneſs of the lower part of the wall, twelve feet four.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I could not perceive any traces of the winding ſtairs mentioned by Mr Gordon: but theſe buildings have ſuffered greatly ſince that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſaw them: I have no doubt of his accuracy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Theſe were in all probability places of defence, but it is difficult to ſay any thing on the ſubject of their origin, or by what nation they were erected. They are called here, <hi>Caiſteal Teilbali,</hi> or the <hi>Caſtle of Teilba,</hi> built by a mother for her four ſons, as tradition, delivered in this tranſlation of four Erſe lines, informs:
<q>
                        <l>"My four ſons a fair clan</l>
                        <l>"I left in the ſtraith of one Glen.</l>
                        <l>"My Malcomb my lovely Conil</l>
                        <l>"My Telve my Troddan.</l>
                     </q>
There had been two others, now totally demoliſhed, and each named after her children. Mr Gordon mentions others of this kind, one of which is called the <hi>Dune</hi> of <hi>Dornadilla,</hi> from an imaginary Prince, who reigned 260 years before the chriſtian aera.</q>—By a paragraph ſome time ago in Lloyd's Evening Poſt, and from a note given by Mr Pennant, which he ſays he had from the Edinburgh Magazine, this place is deſcribed; part of which I will tranſcribe, as pertinent to my preſent object.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The entrance is a very low and narrow door, to paſs through which one is obliged to ſtoop much: but perhaps the ground may have been raiſed ſince the firſt erection. When one is got in and placed in the center, it is open over head. All round the ſides of the walls are ranged ſtone ſhelves, one above another, like the ſhelves in a circular
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0085300201:292"/>
beaufet, reaching from near the bottom to the top. There is ſome remains of an awkward ſtair-caſe. Some years ſince I happened, at an auction of books in London, to look into a French book contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gauliſh Antiquities, and there I ſaw a print of the remains of a Druidic temple in France, which greatly reſembles the tower I am ſpeaking of, having like ſhelves in it. And reading a late pamphlet on the antiquity of the Iriſh language, I think I can partly trace the origin of the name Dornadilla.—Dorn means a round ſtone; ſo that Abdorn would mean the round ſtone of the prieſts; na is of, and Di is God; ulla means a place of devotion: ſo that Dor-na-di-ulla will ſignify the round ſtone place of the worſhip of God; or perhaps it might allude to ſome round ſtone preſerved within, as a ſacred em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of Divinity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From the whole of theſe quotations I would determine, that by the name of <hi>Yevering Bell,</hi> or <hi>Bel-ad-Gebrin,</hi> is implied <hi>a ſacred mount</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the adoration of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and uſed in fire worſhip. Of this the <hi>kairn</hi> is a corroborating proof. The circumvallation ſhews, by its ſimilarity to thoſe ſpoken of, that the perſons who uſed this mount for their religious rites, derived thoſe rites from the ſame ſource as thoſe quoted, and fixes the antiquity of <hi>Yevering Bell</hi> to very remote ages. It is a point not to be doubted, that <hi>Yevering</hi> for ſome time was the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>Saxon Kings</hi> in the Heptarchy. If we ſhould carry the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of <hi>Yevering Bell</hi> no further, we will find its appropriation then to religious offices, as probable as in a more diſtant antiquity. The Saxons brought with them many Eaſtern cuſtoms: they worſhipped the <hi>Sun,</hi> had their <hi>high places,</hi> and rites of <hi>fire worſhip</hi> and ſacrifice. As to my own judgment, I ſhould be inclined to fix the antiquity of this place to their aera. The <hi>Druid tribes</hi> have left us ſuch imperfect evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their cuſtoms, that it is impoſſible to fix any thing poſitively there. It is even moſt probable this was of <hi>Saxon origin,</hi> from its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity to the royal reſidence, and the greatneſs of the work. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular buildings have never been fixed to any particular people: their conſtructors ſtill remain undiſcovered. The circles of ruins on the ſides of <hi>Yevering Bell,</hi> may have been ſimilar to thoſe viſited by Mr Pennant; it is probable theſe circular erections were the towers of the prieſts, who there taught the principles of their religion and the elements of natural philoſophy; and that there they ſtored up the treaſures of the country in times of public danger, which from the veneration paid by all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to thoſe ſacred places were inviolable. Beſides, they were well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0085300201:293"/>
for defence, upon aſſault. The circles formed by rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hewn ſtones, found in many parts of the North, have been regarded by all Antiquaries as places of public convocation, where juſtice was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed. The number of ſtones might denote the tribes or diſtricts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of each Druid, as the Iſraelites numbered their tribes by ſuch columns at the paſſage of Jordan.</p>
               <p>At a little diſtance from the <hi>Bell,</hi> to the ſouthward is a large <hi>kairn</hi> of ſtones, called <hi>Tom Tallon's Grave:</hi> but who this perſonage was, no hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory informs us.</p>
               <p>Some mountains near <hi>Yevering,</hi> have the names of <hi>Newton Eaſt and Weſt Tor.</hi> On one of them is a <hi>kairn</hi> of ſtones, alſo on the weſtern point of <hi>Cheviot,</hi> and on a mount called <hi>Whitlau,</hi> all in view of each other. Theſe <hi>Tors</hi> are ſaid by ſeveral authors, to be held by the <hi>Saxons</hi> ſacred to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Mr Bryant's remarks are, <q>
                     <hi>Tor</hi> is an <hi>hill</hi> or <hi>tower.</hi> They were called by the <hi>Amonians,</hi> who firſt erected them, <hi>Tar</hi> and <hi>Tor;</hi> the ſame as the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> which ſignified both a <hi>hill</hi> and <hi>tower.</hi> The words <hi>Tar, Tor,</hi> and <hi>Tarit,</hi> ſhew that they implied <hi>temples,</hi> and dedications to the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                  </q>—He inſtances many facts to prove this poſition, among which are, <q>
                     <hi>Tor-on,</hi> a place in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> literally ſignifying the <hi>tower of the Sun.</hi> Alſo <hi>Tir-it,</hi> of the ſame ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and <hi>Tor-ambi,</hi> the <hi>oracular tower of Ham.</hi>
                  </q>—He has in another place this ſentence, <q>I will therefore ſay ſo much in further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Britiſh Antiquarian,</hi> as to inform him, that names of places, eſpecially of hills, promontories, and rivers, are of long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſuffer little change. The ſame may be ſaid of every thing which was eſteemed at all ſacred; ſuch as temples, towers, and high mounds of earth, which in early times were uſed for altars.</q>—And in another place, <q>There was another name current among the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> by which they called their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <hi>high places.</hi> This was <hi>Taph,</hi> which at times was rendered <hi>Tuph, Toph,</hi> and <hi>Taphos.</hi> The <hi>Amonians,</hi> when they ſettled in <hi>Greece,</hi> raiſed many <hi>Tupha</hi> in different parts; but as it was uſual in ancient times, to bury perſons of diſtinction under heaps of earth formed in this faſhion, theſe <hi>Tapha</hi> came to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify <hi>tombs;</hi> and almoſt all the <hi>ſacred mounds</hi> built for religious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, were looked upon as monuments of deceaſed heroes;</q> of which he gives many inſtances.</p>
               <p>I have dwelt too long on this ſubject, though an intereſting one to thoſe who may hereafter viſit theſe places.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0085300201:294"/>I muſt not quit this country without remarking, that as we advanced towards the boundary of the kingdoms, the hills were cloathed with a ſingular verdure, affording fine ſheep walks; and the flocks and herds were numerous. The cottages of the lower claſs of people are deplorable, compoſed of upright timbers fixed in the ground, the interſtices wattled and plaiſtered with mud: the roofs, ſome thatched, and others covered with turf; one little piece of glaſs to admit the beams of day; and a hearth ſtone on the ground, for the peat and turf fire. Within, there was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a ſcene, to touch the feelings of the heart: deſcription ſickens on the ſubject, and a tear of pity blots out the moving line, which ſtrives to depict. I wiſhed for ſome of the diſcontented great ones, who, palled with luxury, deſpiſe their palaces, to change the ſcene for a little, juſt time ſufficient to gain conviction, that the cottager and crowned head are both of one ſpecie of animals, and of one race. The damp earth, the naked rafters, the breeze-diſturbed embers, and diſtracted ſmoke that iſſues from the hearth, moved by contrary blaſts, breaking through a thouſand crannies; the mid-day gloom, the wretched couch, the wooden utenſils that ſcarce retain the name of convenience, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic beaſt that ſtalls with its maſter, the diſconſolate poultry that mourn on the rafters, form a group of objects for a great man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants are of abject countenance, and miſerably cloathed, ſeeming to confeſs the loweſt degree of poverty. The employment of the men is in the field; moſt of them are ſhepherds or herdſmen. The corn land, which is very little in quantity compared with the meadows and grazing grounds, lays mingled with the other over the open faces of the vales, without any fences; to protect which, many an indolent herdſman ſtands for hours wrapped up in his plaid, hanging over a ſtaff, half animated; or otherwiſe laying proſtrate upon the ground. During the time he is engaged in this duty, if he had a ſpade put in his hand, and was broke into the rules of induſtry, he might be moſt uſefully employed: he could fence the ground which he tends, in the time he ſpends in herding it: but evil cuſtoms, when they correſpond with habitual indolence, are as hard to be eradicated, as to move a mountain—a long ſeries of applications and labour, and the redoubled effects of example and experience, muſt effect it. In conſequence of this ſtupid cuſtom, the farmer is neceſſarily obliged to keep a multitude of ſervants. Their wages are paid in the products of the land—grain,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0085300201:295"/>
wool, maintenance of ſheep and cattle; very few money payments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed.</p>
               <p>From the openneſs of the country, the traveller is conſequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with croſs roads, where not a guide-poſt has been known ſince the creation: to remedy this evil, intelligence muſt be gained from one of theſe herds; and it is remarkable, that there is a ferocity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated fullenneſs of mind in thoſe two-legged animals, which ſcarce confeſſes civilization enough to direct a ſtranger on his way. When you obtain inſtructions, it is in a manner as he would chace a beaſt from treſpaſs. I cannot forbear comparing the countenance of the lower claſs of Engliſh, in the northern counties, with that of the Scotch—I do not draw my remarks ſolely from my preſent tour, but through obſervations made in many little pleaſure jaunts in Scotland—Though you perceive the moſt abject poverty in the loweſt rank of the Scotch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet even under thoſe weeds of diſtreſs, there is ſeen a ſingular open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benevolence of countenance. By ſome it may be objected, that this ariſes from their ſervility, and theſe are no other than feigned looks of ſubmiſſion. Ariſe from what it will, ſuch countenance carries more of the character of humanity, than the proud ſternneſs, and brutal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, which mark thoſe who boaſt a ſavage liberty. But it is to be obſerved, that ſervility ſtamps the countenance with abject timidity, which is not written on the Scotch features—a generous nature, and the liberality of a mind enlarged with education, are rather the givers of ſuch openneſs and benevolence of look. Almoſt every Scotch village is bleſſed with a free ſchool. You will find ſhepherds on the Scotch hills, familiar with the poets and hiſtorians of Rome and Greece: ſuch familiarity introduces an adoption of principles and ſentiments; and from thence we ſee in theſe poor people, the maxims of mind which graced the illuſtrious names of old. Can we wonder then at the deſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity there appears in the lower claſs of the two nations?—But there is another ſource from whence a part of this complaiſancy and hoſpitality of the lower Scotch may be deduced: they are ſtrict in their religious principles; they are punctual attendants on public worſhip; they hold with great ſacredneſs their obſervance of the Sabbath day; moſt of their paſtors are not only rigid in their example, but arduous in their duty and adminiſtration: amongſt the people there is a juſt ſenſe conceived, even in the loweſt minds, of man's duty to his God. The reverſe is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the Engliſh, that the compariſon is ſcarce required. So far from perceiving a religious principle in the lower claſſes, ſome of them
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0085300201:296"/>
have not even been informed of their Redeemer; thouſands have never entered a place of worſhip; the Sabbath is diſtinguiſhed only as a day of idleneſs, in which gaming and drinking are purſued; many of the teachers of the goſpel, with an indolence and averſion apparent in their whole carriage, perform as a ſtale and ſtupid taſk the offices of the church. Men are influenced by example; evil example contaminates the moſt where the minds are moſt illiterate; weak men take many of their vices by adoption: if it were not for our new ſectaries, our ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling preachers, the name of God would not be promulged to one-tenth part of England's inhabitants. It is true they teach his laws, as the laws of the God of terrors: it is better they ſhould adminiſter to him with the horrors of hell, than there be no miniſtry. We have reformed the church, till we have expelled the ſpirit of prayer: we have refined the pulpit, till nothing but the grace of declamation remains: and our church manners are poliſhed into that exquiſite inſipidity, that if it were not for tithes, the major part of the pariſh would forget the holy men of God.</p>

               <p>Within a little diſtance of Copeland, three remarkable battles were fought: the one on the plains of <hi>Milfield,</hi> where a body of the Scotch
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0085300201:297"/>
were defeated before the battle of Branxton by <hi>Sir William Bulmer of Brancepeth,</hi> who commanded the forces of the Biſhoprick of Durham. The Scots lay in ambuſh among the broom which then covered the plain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Milfield,</hi> now a little village, was the reſidence of the Saxon Kings of <hi>Bernicia,</hi> after the death of <hi>Edwin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another battle was fought at a place called <hi>Haltwell Sweire,</hi> where <hi>Sir Henry Percy,</hi> brother to the ſixth Earl of Northumberland, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in the fifth year of the reign of Queen Mary, 1558, by a troop of the Scots under the command of the <hi>Earl of Bothwell,</hi> conſiſting of 1000 horſe. Percy's cavalry were thrown into confuſion by a diſcharge of fire arms, to which they were not well trained.</p>
               <p>The third battle was at Broomridge,<note n="*" place="bottom">The place of this battle is treated with great uncertainty by many authors: the name uſed by <hi>Fordun</hi> is <hi>Brunauburgh; Camden,</hi> from its ſimilarity, fixes it at <hi>Broomrigs.</hi> The many lines, breaſtworks, and intrenchments, teſtify that this was the place of ſome great action.</note> where a confuſion of lines and intrenchments are yet to be ſeen. Here <hi>Athelſtan</hi> engaged the united forces of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> King of <hi>Scotland, Eugenius Oweine</hi> or <hi>Ewaine</hi> King of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Anlap</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> in the year 928, and gained a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat victory, though with the loſs of <hi>Elwin</hi> and <hi>Athalſtan,</hi> his kinſmen, men of great valour. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> eſcaped into Scotland, <hi>Anlaf</hi> took re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in Dublin, but what became of <hi>Ewaine</hi> is not mentioned.

I determined to viſit <hi>Mailroſs,</hi> and paſſed the village of <hi>Paſton,</hi> formerly belonging to the family of Selbys. On an adjoining hill, called the Harelaw, (the name implying the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an army) is a circular intrenchment with a double rampier and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0085300201:298"/>
foſs. From thence there is a fine proſpect of the vale, where it gave us great pleaſure to obſerve the new modes of huſbandry taking place— turnips cultivated in drill ſowing, with horſe and hand hoeing prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed. There is a very great want of fences in this part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: habit and cuſtom are only to be ſubdued by time and example.</p>
               <p>After paſſing ſome few miles beyond the boundary of the kingdoms, and gaining an eminence above <hi>Tweeddale,</hi> we had a view of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> and the rich extenſive vale which borders the river. Having travelled near 18 miles in the rude and mountainous country from <hi>Wooler,</hi> where we ſeldom had in ſight a cultivated valley or fertile tract of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, except at <hi>Paſton,</hi> or the plain of <hi>Milfield,</hi> but all the mighty ſcene was filled with ſtupendous mountains, on whoſe ſummits reſted an inceſſant gloom and driving rain; and after climbing thoſe lofty ſteeps, in ſearch of evidences of antiquity, and traverſing boundleſs waſtes, the preſent proſpect gave us unuſual pleaſure. The vale before us abounded in corn, and the extended ſcene poſſeſſed all the variety that nature exhibits; the diſtant grounds were lifted up in a wild arrangement of mountains. By the margin of the river, the yellow fields were ſo mixed with the meads, as to reſemble flowers of gold, wrought on the green robe of happy Tweed. Few fences ſubdivide the vale: but here and there fine woods are ſcattered; before us lay the delightful town of Kelſo; on the left hand, a cultivated country, through which the Tweed flows in meanders; on whoſe banks Sir John Douglas's, and the palace of the Duke of Roxburgh, with their exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive woodlands, are beautifully diſpoſed. The Helton Mountains, three fine conic eminences, form obeliſks at the diſtance of 15 miles up the vale; over which, and on each ſide, mountains behind mountains are ſeen, not united, but diſtinctly ſurging from little valleys, which open around their baſes, then glowing with ſtreams of yellow light. This hue was delicately mellowed by the azure tinge of the hills, which formed the horizon. The ſame mountainous ground was in the diſtant proſpect in front; only differing in this, that the eye penetrated the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated vales, at the feet of the hills, which ſtand at a much greater diſtance from each other, and did not appear thrown together as in the longer line of perſpective. To the right we viewed the ſeat of Dr Johnſton, embowered in thick woods. Down the river the vale is more contracted, and leſs diſtant proſpect was taken in: the town of Coldſtream was diſtinctly viewed, with a multitude of inferior villages; above which, the ſeat of Lord Hume, with the riſing plantations around

it, fill the inclining ground. I never beheld a richer valley than we looked upon here: the crops of corn were ſurprizingly great; the whole being reaped, ſtood in ſheafs: the meadows were luxuriant, and every object wore the happy aſpect of opulence.</p>
               <p>We conſtantly regretted the want of fences in this tour; they would give a great grace to the banks of Tweed, by interſecting the rich ſcene. The advantage they would be of to the country is obvious; they would check the ſeverities of winter, and reſiſt that raking blaſt, which, when unoppoſed, ſhears the extenſive grounds wherever it paſſes in the ſpring of the year; conſequently they would forward the progreſs of ſummer.</p>
               <p>We deſcended to the town of</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>KELSO,</head>
               <p>which lays on the northern banks of Tweed; and to which we had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by a fine ſtone bridge of ſix arches.</p>
               <p>From the ſouthern banks of the river, the town with its invirons has the moſt pictureſque appearance: where I ſtood to obſerve its beauties, I had the bridge on my right; an excellent though plain ſtructure of modern work, ſtretching acroſs a fine river of tranſparent water, gently curling over a pebbly channel. On the oppoſite ſhore, which is banked in, ſtands the modern and elegant Manſion of Mrs Dixon, a widow Lady; a ſquare hewn-ſtone ſtructure, placed in the midſt of a garden, opening to the river; ornamented with a ſmall Gothic temple, a green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe and ſtove; with ſtatues diſpoſed on the graſs plots, which were interſected with gravel walks and flower knots. Over this modern and faſhionable ſcene, an auguſt pile, in all the ſolemnity of ruin, frowns majeſtically—an old abbey ſtands near this manſion, a lofty ſtructure, built in the heavieſt of the Gothic order—two round towers of the ſouth limb of the croſs, ſurmounted by a part of the center tower, formed the aſpect on which we looked: the windows are ſmall, and the whole edifice gloomy.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange what diſſimilar ideas ſometimes ſtrike the imagination: as I gazed upon this ſcene, I ſaid to myſelf, Thus Charactacus, in the great reverſe of his fortune, looked with contempt on the pageantry and pomp of his Roman conquerors: There could not be a finer contraſt
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0085300201:301"/>
than in theſe two ſtructures. The town of Kelſo crowded the back ground of our proſpect. To the left the view opened upon the vale, terminated by the noble woods which adjoin the ſeat of the Duke of Roxburgh: to the right, through the arches of the bridge, were ſeen fine perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular rocks, crowned with ſtately trees on the river's brink.</p>
               <p>We entered Kelſo, which is clean and well built: Mr Pennant ſays it is much after the manner of a Flemiſh town. It hath a ſpacious ſquare market-place, with a town-houſe piazza'd beneath, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the market; the number of inhabitants about 3000; the weekly market conſiderable, vaſt quantities of corn being ſold here, though chiefly by ſample. The Inn was elegant, the people obliging, and the attendants particularly alert and condeſcending.</p>
               <p>Kelſo is a borough of the Duke of Roxburgh, and is governed by his Bailiff. It is not remarkable for any great manufactory or trade, but appears to be the place of reſidence of many people of eaſy fortune. Some part of the great ſtocks of wool furniſhed by this country, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactured here into cloths called plains, but dreſſed in England. There is alſo a manufacture of white leather for the Edinburgh market.</p>
               <p>The monaſtery here was founded by King David. During his brother Alexander's reign, he had brought over from Tyrone, in France, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Monks of a reformed order, founded by Bernard d'Abbeville, a man of high reputation for ſanctity and ſeverity of life; theſe he ſettled firſt at Selkirk with an ample revenue: afterwards making Roxburgh his reſidence, he removed his favourite Monks thither; and when he came to the Crown, built for them the abbey and monaſtery of Kelſo, and fixed them there on the 2d of May, 1128, having dedicated the church to the Virgin Mary and St John the Evangeliſt. Bernard the founder of this order, was a diſciple of Robert d'Arbriſſer, founder of the order of Fontevraud, which by a conſtitution almoſt peculiar to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, conſiſted of both Monks and Nuns, and had an Abbeſs to govern the ſociety. Bernard founded the monaſtery of Tyrone in the year 1109, from which place his diſciples derived their name. The habit of the Tyronenſian Monks, was a light grey, but was afterwards changed to black. Fordun poſitively ſays, theſe Monks ſettled at Selkirk in 1109; but Symeon of Durham, that they were not placed there till 1113, and remained fifteen years. According to Fordun, the ſucceſſion of Abbots was as follows: Ralph, one of the Monks brought over from France,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0085300201:302"/>
was the firſt Abbot, but on the death of Bernard, returned to ſucceed him in the Abbacy of Tyrone; William ſucceeded to Selkirk, and on the death of Ralph, alſo returned to Tyrone, as ſucceſſor to that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy; Herbert ſucceeded William, and was the firſt Abbot of Kelſo. It is preſumed that David, who was a lover of the fine arts, as well as a patron of every national improvement, had in view, on his importing this colony from France, not only the advancement of religion, but alſo that of arts and ſciences, of which his ſubjects were in great need of cultivation, their only occupations, from the remoteſt ages, having been the duty of ſhepherds and the ſervice of the ſword. In the Hiſtory of the Monaſtic Orders, we find, that Bernard the founder of the Tyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſians would have all ſorts of handicrafts practiſed in his monaſtery, as well to prevent the growth of idleneſs, which he eſteemed the mother of vice, as to procure neceſſaries for the ſupport of life. Accordingly in this body were painters, carvers, joiners, ſmiths, maſons, vine-dreſſers, and huſbandmen, who were under the command of an Elder: and what they earned was put into a common ſtock, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the houſe. Kelſo afterwards ſent forth colonies to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Liſmahago, Kilwinning, Aberbrothick, and Lindores.</p>
               <p>This abbey was demoliſhed in 1569,<note n="*" place="bottom">Leſlie, lib. 10. p. 527.

Reformation has hitherto always appeared in the form of a zealot full of fanatic fury; with violence ſubduing, but through madneſs creating almoſt as many miſchiefs in its overſights, as it overthrew errors in its purſuit. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has received a greater ſhock by the preſent ſtruggle to repreſs ſome formularies, and ſave ſome ſcruples, than it ever did by the growth of ſuperſtition. She now bleeds inwardly; thinking men are driven into confuſion, and the unthinking turn infidels:—theſe are the glorious works of modern fanaticiſm.</p>
               <p>The abbey of Kelſo was built in the form of a Greek croſs: the nave and quire are totally demoliſhed; the north and ſouth ailes remain ſtanding, being each about 20 paces in length. The walls are orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with falſe round arches, interſecting each other: the remains of the eaſtern end ſhew a part of a fine open gallery. Two ſides of the

center tower are ſtanding, now near 70 feet high, but have been much more lofty: it is galleried within, the pillars are cluſtered, the arches circular, with few members, and without any great ornament. The
<figure/>
north and ſouth ends have an uniformity, bearing each two round towers, the centers riſing ſharp to the roof: the north door way is formed by a circular arch, with various members falling behind each other, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported on pilaſters; the windows and work above, very plain. Three bells now hang in the uppermoſt windows, this part of the nave having lately been uſed for divine ſervice. We did but juſt look into it; all pomp was utterly eradicated, and every degree of pageantry defaced. The windows of this abbey are of circular arches, and remarkably ſmall, the whole mode of architecture ſingular, and unlike any ſtructure I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have ſeen in England: the walls are thick, and every where ponderous. There is a Gothic gloomineſs throughout the whole, that carries the appearance of a priſon, rather than a houſe of prayer; and yet theſe ruins have a countenance of ſullen ſolemnity, which mingling with the beautiful ſcene around, has a grand effect.</p>

It was at firſt under the Biſhoprick of St Andrews, but afterwards made a member of the See of Glaſgow: it had ſeveral immunities, and the Abbot and Monks had liberty to receive ordination, and the other ſacraments of the church, from any Biſhop they pleaſed in Scotia or Cumbria.<note n="*" place="bottom">By Innes's Critical Eſſay, this Camb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>I cannot leave Kelſo, without regretting my not arriving there in time to ſee the races, which had been the preceding week. Theſe are founded not on the ſordid principles of gaming, or diſſipation, or fraud, but on the beautiful baſis of benevolence, and with the amiable view of conciliating the affections of two nations, where the good and the bad, common to every place, are only divided by a rill ſcarcely to be diſtinguiſhed: but prejudice for a time could find no merit but within its own narrow bourn. Some enlarged minds however, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to break the faſcination of erroneous opinion, to mix with their fellow ſubjects, and to inſtruct both the great vulgar and the ſmall, that the northern and ſouthern bounders of the Tweed, created in their inhabitants but a mere difference, without a diſtinction, and that virtue and good ſenſe were equally common to both. At theſe races the Stewards are ſelected from each nation: a Percy and a Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas may now be ſeen hand in hand; the example of charity ſpreads, and may it ſpread with all its ſweet influences, to the remoteſt corner of our iſland.</q>

He accordingly called them before his Kirk Seſſion; but in place of libelling them for drunkenneſs, he accuſed them of ſome ſcandalous indecencies, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching even to prophanity; and while this action was pendent, and before any proof was heard, and even before ſome of the gentlemen accuſed had appeared before the Seſſion, he thought proper to mount his pulpit, and iſſue forth, in the ſhape of a ſermon, a moſt dreadful f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However a majority of the Seſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in a ſentence, <q>ordering the gentlemen to appear before the face of the congregation, to receive his public rebuke, and referred to the Preſbytery what public cenſure ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</q> The gentlemen did not chooſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dr Wotherſpoon ill brooking the moderation of the Preſbytery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly threatened, if the Preſbytery did not affirm the ſentence of his Seſſion, and alſo inflict a more ſevere cenſure, <q>to print his ſermon, prefix the gentlemens names to it, and either bring them to the ſubmiſſion he wiſhed, or brand their names with infamy and diſgrace through the Britiſh dominions.</q> And immediately after the Preſbytery's ſentence, he did publiſh his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with a narrative prefixed, accuſing the gentlemen by name, of all the crimes he had laid to their charge; but of which the Preſbytery had unanimouſly acquitted them; and it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed to be ſold in every corner of Scotland, where any of the gentlemen had any connections, Paiſley, Glaſgow, Edinburgh, Sterling, &amp;c. The Doctor alſo entered an appeal to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly, which he afterwards thought proper to withdraw. The gentlemen brought their action before the Court of Seſſion, complaining very loud of the injuries they had ſuffered, and which they ſaid had been attended with very bad conſequences to them. The Court ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the higheſt indignation againſt Dr Wotherſpoon's conduct, gave 150l. damages, with coſts to a conſiderable amount.

It is told, to the eternal diſgrace of this Legate, that in a Council at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, having declaimed bitterly againſt the ſin of a Prieſt, who had riſen from the ſide of an Harlot to conſecrate the Hoſt; he was found himſelf the following night in bed with an Harlot.</note> of Pope Honorius, came to the Scottiſh King at Roxburgh, in the year 1125, to determine the controverſy touching the Primacy of York over the Scottiſh church. In 1126, King David returning from the Court of England, was attended to Roxburgh by Thurſtan Archbiſhop of York, Ralph Biſhop of Durham, and Algar Prior of St Cuthbert's convent in Durham.<note n="†" place="bottom">Smith's Appendage to Bede, p. 764.</note>
               </p>
               <p>King David I. made this the place of his reſidence, during the reign of his brother Alexander. Hither he brought his favourite Monks of Tyrone, from Selkirk, before he placed them at Kelſo, and built the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey there. He added to the ſtrength of the place, increaſed its fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and made it one of the chief bulwarks of his kingdom.</p>
               <p>Malcolm Macbeth, who pretended to be the ſon of Earl Angus, and was in arms againſt his Sovereign King David in 1234, was impriſoned in the Tower of Roxburgh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0085300201:310"/>By the Chronicle of Mailroſs it appears, that the church of St James, at Roxburgh, was dedicated the 17th of April, 1234.</p>
               <p>King David was the great patron of every national improvement: he obſerved the example of Lewis le Gros, in civil and commercial eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and granted many charters of incorporation to his cities and burghs. The burgh laws he cauſed to be framed from the remarks made by learned men, ſent by him for the purpoſe into foreign ſtates, to reap the ſpirit and efficacy of each conſtitution. It is probable that Roxburgh was one of the firſt of thoſe communities in Scotland; for in an ancient manuſcript copy of the burgh laws, of which David was the undoubted author, the title prefixed declares them to be the laws and cuſtoms of the four burghs, viz. Berwick, Roxburgh, Edinburgh, and Sterling. A further evidence that theſe were the firſt royal burghs, is in the court kept by the King's Chamberlain, where his office appears to give him juriſdiction over all the King's burghs; the court being called <hi>the court of the four burghs,</hi> and conſiſted of Delegates from the burghs above mentioned, three or four from each burgh, who by virtue of the Chamberlain's ſummons, aſſembled annually at Haddington, where all appeals from the peculiar courts of each ſingle burgh were heard and finally determined.</p>
               <p>The confirmatory charter of King Malcolm to Kelſo, dated 1159, was given at Roxburgh. It appears by this charter, that the King made Roxburgh his reſidence, as he frequently attended divine ſervice at the church at Kelſo; for he confirms to that church all the offerings made by himſelf and his attendants, whenſoever on ſolemnities or other days he heard the ſervice of God in that church. The populouſneſs of Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh and the country in the neighbourhood, may be inferred from the mention of churches in that place, granted to the Kelſo convent, as freely as they had been held by Acceline the Archdeacon, and which churches ſeem diſtinct from the then lately erected church of St James. The ſame appears from the grant of 20 chalders, partly corn and partly meal, (inter farinam &amp; frumentum) to be paid out of the Roxburgh mills, which probably was the eſtimate of the amount of the ſeventh part of the mills granted in David's charter to the abbey of Selkirk. Mention is alſo made of a new town of Roxburgh.</p>
               <p>In 1197, the rebellious Harold Earl of Caithneſs was confined in Roxburgh. This perfidious Earl having delivered Torphin his ſon as
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0085300201:311"/>
an hoſtage for his future fidelity, by his repeated treaſons, occaſioned him to become a ſacrifice to the reſentment of his King, who in his wrath being devoid of humanity, gave the innocent youth up to the moſt dreadful tortures and excruciating death.<note n="*" place="bottom">His eyes were bored out, and his genitals torn off.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In 1209, William the Lion aſſembled a great army at Roxburgh to oppoſe King John, who had approached the borders, and lay at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; but hoſtilities were prevented by a timely convention and a truce.</p>
               <p>In 1215, King John, incenſed againſt the northern Barons for their doing homage to King Alexander II. at Felton, marched northward in the middle of winter, and laid the country waſte with fire and ſword, exerciſing the greateſt cruelties on the diſtracted inhabitants. He burnt the towns of Milford, Morpeth, Alnwick, Wark, and Roxburgh, in this horrid expedition.</p>
               <p>In 1239, Roxburgh appears to have been reſtored; for here King Alexander II. celebrated his marriage, on the 4th of March in that year, with the daughter of Ingelram de Conci, and on the 4th of September, 1241, the Queen brought forth a ſon here, Alexander, who ſucceeded to the Crown of Scotland.</p>
               <p>In 1255, Roxburgh was the place of refuge for King Alexander III. and his young Queen, who had been prohibited conſummation of their marriage by the guardians of the kingdom: of which complaint had been ſent to King Henry III. her father, wherein ſhe ſet forth the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſhe underwent from the guardians, who held her in ſtrict confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, refuſed her the attendants and maids ſhe choſe, and debarred her from the embraces of her huſband. The Earl of Glouceſter, with others ſent by King Henry, aſſiſted by the Earl of Dunbar and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, ſurprized the Caſtle of Edinburgh, and taking poſſeſſion of the perſons of the King and Queen, conveyed them under a ſtrong guard to Roxburgh, where the Queen's diſtreſſes were relieved, although her royal ſpouſe was then only 14 years of age.</p>
               <p>Prince Edward, ſon to Henry III. when on an expedition againſt the northern rebels who were in combination with John de Veſcy, after his forfeiture of Alnwick, proceeded to Roxburgh in the year 1266, where he was received with the greateſt demonſtrations of joy by the King
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0085300201:312"/>
and Queen of Scotland, attended on that occaſion by a numerous body of the Scotch nobility.</p>
               <p>The marriage of Alexander Prince of Scotland to the daughter of the Earl of Flanders, was celebrated here on the 9th of April, 1283, the nuptial feaſt being continued for 15 days with the greateſt magnificence.</p>
               <p>King Edward I. in 1296, reduced the Caſtle of Roxburgh, where he continued ſeveral days with his army; during which time he was rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with 15,000 freſh troops from Wales.</p>
               <p>In the ſucceeding year Edward having muſtered his forces at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, with an army of 2000 heavy armed horſe, 1200 light horſe, and 100,000 foot, proceeded to the Scotch border. The Scotch army, which for a conſiderable time had laid before Roxburgh, in hopes of reſtoring to his liberty the Biſhop of Glaſgow, who was priſoner there, hearing of ſo great an army advancing, raiſed the ſiege. The relief brought by the Engliſh to the garriſon of Roxburgh Caſtle was highly ſeaſonable, for they were already reduced to great hardſhips; and the inhabitants of the town, from the circumvallation formed by the Scotch, were brought to great diſtreſs for want of proviſions.</p>
               <p>On Shrove Tueſday, in the year 1313, the garriſon of Roxburgh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging themſelves on that feſtival in an impolitick ſecurity, were given up to riot and diſſipation, when they were ſurprized by Sir James Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas, with a reſolute band, who having approached in diſguiſe, mounted the walls by ladders of ropes. The name of Douglas echoed through the place, and rouſed the Engliſh from their feſtivity and drunkenneſs, many of them falling under the ſword of the aſſailants. The Governor retired into the great tower with a few of his men, where after two days reſiſtance, having received a wound in his face by an arrow, he ſurrendered the fortreſs. King Robert Bruce, on receiving intelligence of this exploit, ſent his brother Edward to demoliſh the fortifications, which he effected with great labour.</p>
               <p>King Edward III. in 1334, having come to Newcaſtle in quality of Supreme of Scotland, received the homage of Edward Baliol in a public and ſolemn manner: at which time Baliol, as a recompence for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences King Edward had ſuſtained in recovering and reſtoring to him his inheritance, by letters patent alienated to him, amongſt other things,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0085300201:313"/>
the town, caſtle, and county of Roxburgh, to be annexed to and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated with the Crown of England for ever.</p>
               <p>In 1341, we find Roxburgh again in the poſſeſſion of the Scotch, hav-been recovered by Sir Alexander Ramſay for King David Bruce.</p>
               <p>King Edward III. in 1356, received from Baliol a formal ſurrender of his right to the Crown of Scotland. This he performed by the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of delivering his Crown, with ſome of the ſoil of Scotland, at Roxburgh, where Edward reſided ſome days. This King twice cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated his birth-day in this caſtle.</p>
               <p>In 1372, George Dunbar Earl of March, accompanied by his brother the Earl of Murray, with a large body of their dependants, entered Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh at the time of the annual fair, and in revenge of the death of one of their followers, who was ſlain the preceding year in an affray, ſlew all the Engliſh they found in the town, plundered it of the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of merchandize and goods which were collected there on the above occaſion, and reduced the town to aſhes.</p>
               <p>King James II. of Scotland, availing himſelf of a neglect in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of attending a propoſed convention for continuing the truce in 1460, raiſed an army with great expedition, with which he advanced againſt Roxburgh. At the firſt aſſault he took the town, and levelled it to the ground. A regular ſiege was laid to the caſtle. Here the Scotch King was joined by great reinforcements, among which was the Earl of Huntley with his followers. The King, for former ſervices, deſirous of honouring Huntley, ſhewed him every mark of eſteem and royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; he conducted him to the trenches, to obſerve the diſcharge of his artillery, one of which was remarkable for its ſize, and had the name of the Lion. The King took delight in attending theſe operations, in which he ſhewed a diſtinguiſhed intrepidity, but in the end loſt his life thereby, one of his pieces of ordnance in this ſiege, to which he had approached too near, burſt in diſcharging, whereby the Earl of Angus, who ſtood near the King, was much wounded, at the inſtant that a ſplinter broke the King's thigh and ſtruck him dead. This is the tragical circumſtance before quoted from Camden. The Queen with her eldeſt ſon, then a boy about ſeven years of age, is ſaid to have been in the camp at the time of this dreadful cataſtrophe. She ſuſtained the ſhock with heroic firmneſs, exhorted the Chiefs to deſiſt from unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0085300201:314"/>
lamentations, and to teſtify their reverence for their King's memory, by carrying on the ſiege with redoubled vigour. Her exhortations had the deſired effect, the beſiegers exerted their utmoſt efforts. The garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon finding themſelves reduced to extremities, ſurrendered the fortreſs; and, as Redpath in his Border Hiſtory ſays, <q>that the place which the Engliſh had held for more than 100 years, might thenceforth ceaſe to be a center of rapine and violence, or a cauſe of future ſtrife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the nations, the victors reduced it to a heap of ruins.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We do not find that the fortreſs was reſtored, or that any repairs were made to it to render it tenable until 1547, when the Engliſh army led by the Protector, paſſing the Tweed after the battle of Muſſelbrough, encamped on the plain over-againſt Kelſo, between the ruins of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Caſtle of Roxburgh and the confluence of Tweed and Tiviot. The Protector obſerving the ſtrong and convenient ſituation of this ruined fortreſs, determined to make it tenable. The breaches in part of the ancient walls were filled with bankings of turf, he having reduced the fortreſs in ſize, by caſting up deep trenches on the eaſt and weſt ends within, and fortified them with a wall. Patten's account of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs is in the following terms: <q>That one great ditch of 20 feet broad, with depth accordingly, and a wall of like breadth, depth, and height, ſhould be made croſs within the caſtle, from the one ſide wall to the other, and 40 foot from the weſt end; and that a like trench and wall ſhould alſo be caſt a-traverſe within, about a coit's caſt from the eaſt end; and hereto that the caſtle walls on either ſide, where need was, ſhould be mended with turf, and made with loop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, as well for ſhooting directly forwards as for flanking at hand.</q> So intent was the Protector on this work, that he laboured at it with his own hands two hours every day whilſt it was going on, and his example was followed by moſt of the principal men of his army. The place was made defenſible in ſix days, and there was left in it a garriſon of 300 ſoldiers and 200 pioneers, under Sir Ralph Bulmer.</p>
               <p>Mr Pennant ſays, <q>a large holly, ſurrounded by a wall, marks the ſpot where James II. fell;</q> but it was not noted to me when I viſited the place.</p>
               <p>Near to the ſcite of Roxburgh are the confuſed foundations of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and one gate-way of excellent workmanſhip, which denote the place where ſtood a houſe of Franciſcans.</p>

                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0085300201:315"/>It is not poſſible to tread this ground without the moſt ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections: the viciſſitudes of human life, here ſo remarkably experienced, furniſh the traveller with a crowd of ideas, producing melancholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations. Here, where this turf, now painted with flowers, is browſed by the flocks, once ſtood a town flouriſhing in trade; where feſtivity and mirth often engaged the wealthy inhabitants; where the royal preſence was encircled with the nobility of the land; where the ſplendour of a court was diſplayed; where the royal nuptials and the birth of Princes made a kingdom joyful; where peace brought her olives to crown felicity:—and in reverſe of circumſtances, where theſe cattle graze, armed troops have held their deadly conflicts, the ſoil has drank in the blood of heroes and nobles; even royalty has bled upon theſe plains; the ſhoots of victory or the cries of diſtreſs have often diſtracted theſe now peaceful echoes which make reſponſes to the bleating ſheep; cannon have rent the confuſed atmoſphere, and the clangour of marſhal inſtruments hath filled the gale, which now breathes muſic in the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring groves; revenge, rapine, and innumerable crimes have curſed the ground I tread with every human ſin. Avenging Providence at length hath razed the walls, conſcious of ſuch iniquity; the haughty towers are levelled with the earth, the ploughſhare hath gone over the paths of wicked ages, and all but the name of Roxburgh is clean done out.</p>
               <p>As Roxburgh fell, ſo have empires fallen; and though it is a reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which brings with it the acuteſt ſorrow, yet it muſt be admitted, that when the accompliſhment of time is come, other empires muſt ſink into oblivion. Power and magnificence are periodical, we know not which will be the next that yields in the ſucceſſion. Heaven grant that Britain by her virtues may merit the divine protection, and that her empire may ſurvive to the lateſt ages full of honour.</p>
               <p>It is very remarkable, that not the leaſt traces remain to mark the place where ſo large a town once ſtood; a place ſo eminent, and of ſo great reſort for trade, the reſidence of Kings, and the ſeat of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</p>
               <p>The adjoining territory from the old caſtle and town is called the Sheriffdom of Roxburgh, of which the Douglas's are Hereditary She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, and uſually denominated Sheriffs of Tiviotdale.</p>

I paced the top of this rampier, and found the whole circle to be near 200 paces. In the interior plain, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in the center, but inclining to the ſouth-weſt, is the foundation of a ſtone wall, forming a ſquare of equal ſides, 14 paces each. This probably was the apartment of the General or other officers, or a ſtore-houſe for arms and valuable effects. The height from the top of the upper rampier to the next level, is nearly 18 perpendicular feet, and as ſteep as ſoil or turf can poſſibly be ſuppoſed to lay. The level here, for it can ſcarce be termed a foſs, the rampier on its edge only forming a breaſtwork, is nine paces wide. This ſecond rampier only makes a part of a circle, its points terminating on the brink of a very high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice overhanging the river: the top of this rampier extends 140 paces. The height from the top of the ſecond rampier to the next level, is about 15 perpendicular feet, of as ſteep an aſcent as the former. This level or foſs is only ſix paces wide, the loweſt or third rampier only forming a breaſtwork to the interior level; but from the common plain is ſix feet in height, compoſed of ſtones without any mortar; its points alſo terminate on the edge of the precipice, and its top meaſures 140 paces: ſo that the whole mount appears about 34 perpendicular feet high. The form of this fortification renders it probable, that the chief perſons of the army who lay here, with their valuables, were placed on the crown of the eminence, and that the lower trenches were occupied by the troops, according to the nature of their arms; the heavy-armed ſoldiers in the lower intrenchment; thoſe armed with miſſile weapons on the ſecond and third levels: by which poſition, on an attack, the garriſon could fight as from a theatre, ſtage above ſtage, and when forced from the lower trenches, could ſtill retreat to a ſtation of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority. Theſe are improperly called camps: they ſeem not calculated for encampment, but as forts for a ſecure reſort.</p>
               <p>I preſume this fortification was originally Daniſh, but to what part of the dark hiſtory of thoſe times it may belong, I am totally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>I could heartily wiſh that ſome judicious brother of your Antiquarian Society was but to ſee a Gothic rarity that is in this neighbourhood, (viz.) the beauteous ruins of the Abbey of Mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſs, which I ſhall take upon me to ſay, has been the moſt exquiſite ſtructure of its kind in either kingdom: I wont ſay but other abbies have been larger, ſuch as St Albans, and ſome conventual churches more auguſt, as Beverley; but this of Mailroſs is extravagantly rich in its imagery, niches, and all ſorts of carving by the beſt hands that Europe could produce at that time; nay there is ſuch a profuſion of nice chiſel-work in foliage and flowers at the very top of the ſteeple, that it cannot be ſeen from the ground without the help of a glaſs. The capital of every pillar that ſupports the arches of the church and the doors, are all hollowed with a ſmall tool, being wreathed-work of all ſorts of flowers, ſuch as you have at the entrance of your chapter-houſe at York. Every brother has had a ſtall in the cloiſter (now much demoliſhed) which have been variouſly adorned with the leaves of fern, oak, palm, holly, or ſome other kind of trees.</p>
                           <p>The building from the ſteeple to the eaſt end is entire in the walls, but the roof (which has been of ſtone and carved) is much decayed.</p>
                           <p>The quire is but ſmall, but has a noble eaſt window, the glaſs all out; therein lies a marble ſtone without any inſcription, half a hexagon, tapering ſmaller at the foot, of a bright green colour, and powdered full of white feathers.</p>
                           <p>The whole ſtructure is in the form of a St John of Jeruſalem's croſs, the north and ſouth ailes pretty compleat; at the north ſide of which is a ſtair-caſe that has led into the Prior's houſe.</p>
                           <p>From the ſteeple, weſtward, remain ſix arches of the nave, in which is the preſent kirk, that takes up about three of them; but how much further the ancient church has extended, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve will be hard to know.</p>
                           <p>In every arch of the nave, both north and ſouth, has run a croſs wall into the two ſide ailes, making ſo many ſacella each, with an altar and holy-water pot.</p>
                           <p>The windows are of an equal dimenſion, but variouſly figured and carved.</p>
                           <p>The cloiſter has been on the north ſide of the church, which opened into a garden, that led to the Tweed, that is there of a good breadth, and there was another garden on the oppoſite ſide of the river. Our neighbours are not wanting in the faculty of amplifying, but this thing does really exceed all their exaggerations of praiſe. By this you'll ſneer, and ſay I have lived too long here, and am become as vain as they; however, I ſtand to my aſſertion.</p>
                           <p>There is printed an upright of this abbey, that is ill done. I could wiſh there was not only an exact whole plate, but alſo a view of the eaſt end, with a diſtinct draught of the doors, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, capitals, and ſome of the fineſt images, which are ſo well finiſhed to the life, that Dr King of Oxford, who has been lately to ſee it, wiſhed they were taken down and preſerved from the weather: the whole building is of a fine ſtone.</p>
                           <p>I could wiſh alſo, there was an exact Ichnography drawn of the whole. The Miniſter is a good ſenſible man, a lover of this kind of antiquity, and is daily ſtudying the walls of this church. He ſhewed me ſome of the glaſs of the windows, which is of an uncommon thickneſs, not ſtained through, but painted upon.</p>
                           <p>If by this mean effort, your ſociety could be prevailed upon to take this ſtructure into their conſideration (I know not how far the Scotch gentlemen are engaged in their Monaſticon Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum) I have gained my end, eſpecially if you will vouchſafe me the favour of an anſwer to this, who am, dear couſin,</p>

To the weſtward of this laſt effigy, is the figure of a cripple, on the ſhoulders of one that is blind, well executed; under which you read <hi>"Uncte Dei."</hi> Above the ſouth door is an elegant window, divided by four principal bars or mullions, terminating in a pointed arch; the tracery light, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected at the ſummit into a wheel; the ſtone-work of the whole window yet remaining perfect. This window is 24 feet in height within the arch, and 16 in breadth; the mouldings of the arch contain many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, graced with a filleting of foliage; the outward member runs into a point of pinnacle-work, and encloſes a nich highly ornamented, which it is ſaid contained the figure of our Lord. There are eight niches which ſink gradually on the ſides of the arch, formerly appropriated to receive the ſtatues of the Apoſtles. The whole ſouth end riſes to a point to form the roof, garniſhed with an upper moulding, which is orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a fillet of excellent roſe-work: the center is terminated by a ſquare tower.</p>
               <p>It will ſuffice to remark in this place, that the pedeſtals for ſtatues in general, are compoſed of five members of cornice, ſupported by palm boughs, or ſome other rich wrought foliage, and terminating at the foot in a point with a triple roll. The caps or canopies of the niches are compoſed of delicate tabernacle-work, the ſpires ornamented with mouldings and a fillet of roſe-work, and the ſuſpended ſkirts graced with flowers: the interior of the canopy is of ribbed-work, terminating in a ſuſpended knot in the center. This deſcription will do to carry the reader's idea to every particular nich, without my running into the tediouſneſs of repetition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0085300201:323"/>At the junction of the ſouth and weſt members of the croſs, a hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon tower ariſes, terminating in a pinnacle roofed with ſtone, highly ornamented: from thence the aile is extended ſo as to receive three large windows, whoſe arches are pointed, each divided by three up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right bars or mullions, the tracery various and light; ſome in wheels, and others in the windings of foliage. Theſe windows are ſeparated by buttreſſes ornamented with niches. Here are ſculptured the arms of ſeveral of the Abbots, and that alſo of the Abbacy <hi>"a Mail &amp; roſe."</hi> Theſe buttreſſes ſupport pinnacles of the fineſt tabernacle-work. From the feet of theſe laſt pinnacles, are extended bows or open arches, compoſed of the quarter diviſion of a circle, abutting to the bottoms of another race of buttreſſes which ariſe on the ſide wall of the nave; each of theſe laſt buttreſſes alſo ſupporting an elegant pinnacle of taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle-work, are ornamented with niches, in two of which ſtatues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; one of St Andrew, the other of the Holy Virgin: the ſide ailes are ſlated, but the nave is covered with an arched roof of hewn ſtone. From the weſt end of the church is continued a row of buildings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining five windows, divided by the like buttreſſes, the tracery of two of the windows remaining, the reſt open. Each of theſe windows ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to a ſeparate chapel, appropriated and dedicated to diſtinct perſonages and ſervices; the places of the altars, and the fonts or holy-water baſons ſtill remaining. At the weſtern extremity of this ſtructure, on the laſt buttreſs, are the arms of Scotland, ſupported by Unicorns collared and chained; the motto above broken, the letters EGIS only remaining. On one ſide is the letter I, on the other Q, and a date 1505, which was the ſecond year of the marriage of King James IV. a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage concerted at this abbey, between the King in perſon, and Richard Fox, then Biſhop of Durham.</p>
               <p>In 1649, the fury of reformation ſtill exiſting, the elegant ſtatues which ornamented this place were moſt ſacrilegiouſly demoliſhed. A tradition prevails here, that one of the perſons ſo employed, on ſtriking at the babe in the Virgin's arms, received a contuſion, which diſabled him for ever from ſuch uſeleſs occupation, and ſtruck ſuch a panic on his aſſociates, that they fled and left the miſchievous buſineſs unperfected.</p>
               <p>In Spotſwood's Hiſtory of the Church of Scotland,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 175.</note> we find theſe works of fanatical fury thus mentioned: <q>An act was paſſed for demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0085300201:324"/>
cloiſters and abbey churches, ſuch as were not as yet pulled down; the execution whereof was for the weſt parts committed to the Earls of Arrane, Argile, and Glencarn, for the north to Lord James, and for the in-countries to ſome Barons that were held moſt zealous.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thereupon iſſued a pitiful vaſtation of churches and church build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings throughout all the parts of the realm; for every one made bold to put to their hands, the meaner ſort imitating the enſample of the greater and thoſe who were in authority. No difference was made, but all the churches either defaced or pulled to the ground. The holy veſſels, and whatſoever elſe men could make gain of, as timber, lead, and bells were put to ſale. The very ſepulchres of the dead were not ſpared. The regiſters of the church and biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thekes caſt into the fire. I award all was ruined, and what eſcaped in the time of the firſt tumult, did now undergo the common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; which was ſo much the worſe, that the violences committed at this time were coloured with the warrant of public authority. Some ill-adviſed preachers did likewiſe animate people, in theſe their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous proceedings, crying out, "<hi>that the places where idols had been worſhipped ought by the law of God to be deſtroyed, and that the ſparing of them was the reſerving of things execrable:</hi> as if the commandment given to Iſrael, for deſtroying the place where the Canaanites did worſhip their falſe Gods, had been a warrant for them to do the like. The report alſo went, that <hi>John Knox,</hi> whoſe ſayings were by many eſteemed as oracles, ſhould in one of his ſermons ſay, <hi>that the ſure way to baniſh the Rooks was to pull down their neſts:</hi> which words (if any ſuch did eſcape him) were to be underſtood of the cloiſters of Monks and Friars only, according to the act paſſed in the council. But popular fury once armed can keep no meaſure, nor do any thing with advice and judgment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The eaſt end of the church is compoſed of the choir, with a ſmall aile on each ſide, which appear to have been open to the high altar. This part is lighted by three windows towards the eaſt, and two ſide windows in the aile: the center window is divided by four upright bars or mullions, the traceries are of various figures, but chiefly croſſes, which ſupport a large complicated croſs that forms the center; the arching is pointed, and part of the tracery here is broken: the ſide lights are near as high as the center, but very narrow, divided by three
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0085300201:325"/>
upright bars or mullions: the mouldings of the window arches are ſmall and delicate, yet ornamented with a fillet of foliage. On each ſide of the great window are niches for ſtatues; and at the top there appear the effigies of an old man ſitting, with a globe in his left hand reſted on his knee, with a young man on his right: over their heads an open crown is ſuſpended. Theſe figures, I preſume, repreſent the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perſonages. The buttreſſes at this end terminate in pinnacles of tabernacle-work: the mouldings and ſculptures are elegantly wrought.</p>
               <p>The north end of the croſs aile of this abbey is not much ornamented without, it having adjoined to the cloiſter and other buildings. The door which leads to the ſcite of the cloiſter (the building being demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed) is a ſemicircular arch of many members; the fillet of foliage and flowers, is of the higheſt finiſhing that can be conceived to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in free-ſtone; the ſame being pierced, the flowers and leaves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the ſtone behind, and ſuſpended in a twiſted garland. In the mouldings, pinnacle-work, and foliage of the ſeats which remain of the cloiſter, I may be bold to ſay, there is as great excellence to be found, as in any ſtone-work in Europe, for lightneſs, eaſe, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Nature is ſtudied through the whole, and the flowers and plants are repreſented as accurately as under the pencil. In this fabric there are the fineſt leſſons, and the greateſt variety of Gothic ornaments, that the iſland affords, take all the religious ſtructures together.</p>
               <p>The weſt ſide of the center tower is yet ſtanding: it appears to have ſupported a ſpire; a loſs to the dignity and beauty of the preſent remains, to be regretted by every viſitant: the balcony-work is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, being formed of open roſe-work: the preſent height of the tower wall is 75 feet.</p>
               <p>The length of this edifice from eaſt to weſt is 258 feet, the croſs aile 137 feet, and the whole contents of its Ichnography 943 feet.</p>
               <p>We entered at the ſouth door, and no expreſſion can convey an idea of the ſolemn magnificence which ſtruck the eye: the roof of the north and ſouth ends of the tranſept remains, ſupported by interſecting groins, in various directions, of the lighteſt order; the joinings ornamented with knots, ſome ſculptured with figures, and others of pierced-work in flowers and foliage; the arching of the interſtices conſtructed of thin
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0085300201:326"/>
ſtones, cloſely jointed; over the choir, part of the roof of like work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip ſtill remains. The ſide ailes are formed by light cluſtered pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, richly capitalled, with garlands of flowers and foliage diſpoſed delicately in the mouldings; in ſome the figures of animals are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed. The pillars which ſupported the tower towards the eaſt are gone, ſo that three ſides of it are down, leaving a chaſm, through which you look up towards the remaining quarter.</p>
               <p>The north aile is lighted by a circular window, repreſenting a crown of thorns, which makes an uncommon appearance. Here are the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of Peter and Paul, one on each ſide the tower, but of inferior ſculpture.</p>

Theſe ſad remains of human glory! how are their beauties defaced! thus paſs away the mighty things of the earth! To the eye of him to whom ten thouſand years are as one day, what vanity is the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of men; here, forgotten of the world, lay in the duſt princes and nobles, whoſe titles, authority, and power, are vaniſhed as the <hi>baſeleſs fabric of a viſion.</hi> If ſpirits viſit their terreſtrial abodes, for <hi>it is not the will of</hi> our <hi>father which is in heaven that one of theſe ſhould periſh,</hi> here perhaps wander heroes, who languiſh over their unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated crimes; men of religious orders, who mourn the depravity of the human race, and the deſolation of their temple, where once all human energy was breathed in prayer. If ſpirits viſit their terreſtrial walks, and leave for a time that ineffable beatitude proclaimed to us, <hi>that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of</hi> our <hi>father which is in heaven</hi>—perhaps—alas, it is too true! I loſt a friend! perhaps his expanded eſſence fills this ray, that penetrates the gloom, rejoices in the thoughts which riſe upon my mind, conveys my prayer to the divine propitiatory, prompts each virtuous fervour, and ſubverts all riſing impropriety: perhaps, with that pure affection which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed when living on earth, he looks upon my countenance, commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerates the darkneſs of my faculties, that here are labouring for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or for knowledge!</q>
               </p>
               <p>My eyes grew full of tears, my heart heaved in tumult, my hands were graſped through energy of thought, and I ſtood as a ſtatue, when the approaching foot of my companion rouſed me, preſerving my mind from a growing extravagance of imagination, which was already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with the moſt affecting images.</p>
               <p>In the morning, at ſun-riſe, we again returned to theſe ſplendid ruins, which had even occupied the viſions of our ſleep; we yet had to take a ſurvey of the nave of the church, which is now uſed for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. On opening the door, it is not to be expreſſed, the diſagreeable ſcene which preſented itſelf; this place is filled with ſtalls, in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of which, irregularity alone ſeems to have been ſtudied: ſome
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0085300201:329"/>
are raiſed on upright beams, as ſcaffolds, tier above tier; others ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported againſt the walls and pillars: no two are alike in form, height, or magnitude; the ſame confuſion of little and great, high and low, covers the floor with pews: the lights are ſo obſtructed, that the place is as dark as a vault; the floor is nothing but the damp earth; naſtineſs and irregularity poſſeſs the whole ſcene. The fine workmanſhip of the pillars, whoſe capitals, for flowers and foliage, exceed all the reſt of the building, the ribs of the arches, and the ornaments of their interſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are ſcarce to be ſeen in the horrid gloom which poſſeſſes the place.</p>
               <p>What idea, concomitant to religion, can dictate filthineſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in a houſe of worſhip, I know not: by magnificence and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour the eye may be diverted; but in that elegant ſimplicity, in which cleanneſs and plainneſs are aſſociates, the mind abſtracted from atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to worldly things, will be yielded to uninterrupted devotion. All reformation has been attended with extravagance; bigotry grows up into paſſion, and from one extreme the zealot ruſhes into another. When the pomp of Romiſh worſhip was to be corrected, the Scotch ſunk into the deepeſt reverſe. Many of the old churches in Scotland, which I have ſeen, are filthy and foul; one of the allotments of the Cathedral of St Andrews, in the city of Glaſgow, appropriated to parochial duty, is even in the burial vaults, in the foundation of the ſtructure, without light, but what iſſues through little loop-holes near to the pulpit, where the miniſter ſits to teach his pariſhioners, who are lodged in outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but for uncleanneſs and irregularity this place exceeds them all. I have had dreams of confuſion in my youth, but never formed even a diſeaſed idea like this. It looks like the houſe of lunatics, it is unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled, and defies all language to give it a deſcription; ſuperior to every thing but the incongruities of a Bedlamite's diſordered fancy.</p>
               <p>But to more moderate matters: Here are ſeveral tombs of eminent perſonages; on the north wall is inſcribed, under a coat armour, <q>Here lies the race of the houſe of Zair.</q> Many altars, baſons for holy water, and other remains of ſeparate chapels appear in the ailes, among which are thoſe of St Mary and St Waldave.</p>
               <p>The ſentiments which aroſe to me, whilſt I walked or rather ſtaggered about in this ſtrange ſcene, were much to this effect: I premiſed that true Religion conſiſted of that devout fervour of mind, which gives its
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0085300201:330"/>
ideas to the Divinity, full of gratitude for his benevolence and long-ſufferings, full of admiration of that majeſty and mightineſs which are diſplayed through all his works; and from a true conſciouſneſs of man's demerits and the imperfections of his judgment, full of patience, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and reſignation. When a man who is poſſeſſed of ſuch diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind puts up a prayer, it is only for mercy and protection. In whatever claſs of religious men we find theſe premiſed principles beſt preſerved, we may determine with juſtice, that there the true devotee is diſtinguiſhed. Modes of religion are its corruption; the acceptations of a country, or the preſcriptions of a peculiar ſet of men, may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary to the community in general, but in no wiſe conducive to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the individual. Religion has its eſſence from the liberty of the mind; formularies, maxims, modes, or dictions, are diſguiſes which in the robe confound the ſpirit; are fetters that bind down the fervour of the mind. If the truly devout heart breathe out, "Lord have mercy on me a ſinner," there is more religion in that ſhort ſentence ſo uttered, than in ten thouſand Ave Marys, a million of liturgies, and the frip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery of eſtabliſhment. Charity is as unbounded as the regions of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and beſet with as many gems as the galaxy. Charity ſays, the truly religious of every age, nation, cuſtom, profeſſion, and mode, are acceptable to the Divinity; for it is not the mode, but the ſpirit that approacheth the regions of life. When I tread the walk of antiquity, I venerate the pious works of the heathen: the ſervant of the Deity is to be revered, let his ſervice differ never ſo wide from the eſtabliſhment of which I am a member: it is the eſſence of the act, that I ſever from the defilements of cuſtom: we judge, and may be judged; we think we are right; ſo did the Ancients: the Druid, the Amonian, in his acts of piety, is to be regarded without the errors of his ſunſhine ſervices; he worſhipped the Deity, under the ſymbol of the ſun; an object in nature the moſt reaſonably adopted as the image of the Creator, or as the throne of his majeſty.</p>
               <p>The Roman ſcattering ſalt and meal on the crackling coals, and making his libations to the Divinity under the type of ſome of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, is alſo worthy of our reverence: the errors his modes admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, through charity are exempt from judgment, and his real piety is eſtimated, diveſted of defilements which were contracted from the errors of the age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0085300201:331"/>The Jewiſh pomp and ceremony, the tumultuous and noiſy ſacrifice, the greaſy ſervices, and blood-beſpattered altars, are all forgotten, when we trace the religion of the mind, and the piety of the devotee.</p>
               <p>The magnificent rites of modern Rome looſe their pageantry, and ſink upon our eſtimate, when we compare them to the cell of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; where piety, leaving the eye of men, retires to ſolitudes, and the Recluſe confeſſing the frailties of nature, with purity of ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vows all the religious confidence of faith; we at once turn from the echoing dome, and the acclamations of a choir of eunuchs, to ſeek this holy devotee, the man who communes ſecretly with his own ſoul; who puts off the formulary, and preſents, in his ſolitary cell, a genuine confeſſion and the ſpirit of prayer before his God, whoſe preſence is univerſal.</p>
               <p>The Reformiſt, proteſting againſt the errors of others, like the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural image of imperfection, plucks not the beam from his own eye; though leſs pompous in his ſervice, yet he remains as ceremonious;<note n="*" place="bottom">Our reformed church of England has retained too much of the Popiſh ſpirit and cuſtom, which tends to the deſtruction of rational piety and true chriſtian worſhip.

When many ſuppoſed Mediators were to be addreſſed, repetition was attended with ſome reaſon: theſe are taken away, but the reiteration continues. When the reformiſt breathes the ſighing of a contrite heart, he gains with the devotee of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination an acceptation which depends not upon modes.</p>
               <p>The Preſbyterian avoids much form, but admits much ſlovenlineſs, much indolence, and more negligence; yet the inward ſpirit, which would have been devout in any other claſs of religious, is the ſame worthy devotee in this apparel.</p>
               <p>The ſilent Quaker ſits meditative; his mind, unoccupied by faſhion or form, is open to nature's dictates in all their ſimplicity; he perceives the glow of devotion, the moving ſpirit warms his ſoul, and the heart
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0085300201:332"/>
conceives what the Divinity accepts, though unuttered by the lips. The Fanatic would in the utmoſt agitation be in action, the Bramin be in torture, but this Religious brings offerings of peace; his God is the God of tranquillity. It is the ſervice of the ſpirit is acceptable; the offices of the body are appropriated to corruption, to faſhion, and the follies of the world.</p>
               <p>The canting Hypocrite, who goes about announcing wretchedneſs, and breathing anathemas on mankind, is to be treated with pity and an apothecary.</p>
               <p>Religion is replete with pleaſures, and not burthened with terrors; ſhe bringeth forth the moſt placid hope, and her hope is accompanied with inexhauſtible images of joy. Pope's diſtich, as to modes of faith, is infallibly true:
<q>"His ſure is beſt whoſe life is in the right."</q>
Religion is in the manners, and not in modes of prayer.</p>

               <p>The ancient monaſtery of Mailroſs is ſaid to have ſtood originally a mile from the preſent ruins, but by whom founded is uncertain.—One houſe marks the place, <q>on a lofty promontory, peninſulated by the Tweed: a moſt beautiful ſcene; the banks lofty and wooded, varied with perpendicular rocks, jutting like buttreſſes from top to bottom. This was the ſcite of the ancient abbey of Culdees, mentioned by Bede to have exiſted in 664, in the reign of the Saxon Oſwy. This place was as celebrated for the auſterities of Diricthelmus,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dryethelme had a cell aſſigned him in the moſt retired part of the convent, that he might be leſs diſturbed in his continual devotions.

There he continued praying and ſinging pſalms as long as he could, the water ſometimes coming up to his loins, and ſometimes as far as his neck: and when he came out from it he never thought of caſting off his wet and cold garments, but wore them till they grew dry and warm on his body. In the winter, when encompaſſed with cruſts of ice, he continued this mortification, ſometimes breaking the ice to make room for his ſtanding or dipping.

               <p>The Scotch who are ambitious of antiquity, attribute it to Columbus; ſome more moderate, ſay its original patron was Aidan. Bede ſays it was ſeated on the banks of Tweed; that the churches at that time were built of oak, thatched with reeds; and that the religious of this houſe maintained themſelves a long time againſt the canons and ordinances of the Romiſh councils. On a peninſula formed by the river, you are ſhewn the ſcite of old Mailroſs, with the foundations of the wall, the porter's lodge, the chapel know, and many other places appertaining to that houſe; together with the remains of a bridge over Tweed. Nen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, who lived as ſome authors aſſert in 620, but according to others in 853, ſpeaks of this monaſtery as a place of great note; and probably it was deſtroyed by the Danes when they ravaged this country. Bede gives the names of ſome Abbots here; <hi>Eata</hi> the firſt: he was ſucceeded by <hi>Boiſil,</hi> who according to Dempſter died in 643: <hi>St Cuthbert</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Boiſil,</hi> but afterwards quitted this monaſtery, and went to <hi>Lindisfarne:</hi> he was ſucceeded by <hi>Etholwold.</hi> This is all I can collect of old Mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſs. The houſe of which theſe celebrated ruins are the remains, was founded by David King of Scotland in the year 1136: it was endowed with large revenues and many immunities, as appears by the charters granted to the Abbot and Convent by the Kings of Scotland. In a manuſcript ſaid to be depoſited in the Colbertine Library, giving an account of the ſeveral religious houſes founded by King David, it is mentioned, <hi>Sed Melroſſenſum praecipue inter omnes eccleſias &amp; fideliter defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabat &amp; dulciter diligebat &amp; ſuis opibus exornabat.</hi> Mr Hay ſays it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the book of taxes of the Apoſtolic Chamber, that King David beſtowed thereon 1880 florins. The original charter of foundation was
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0085300201:334"/>
confirmed by his ſon Prince Henry, and intimates that he gave to this abbey the whole lands of Mailroſs, Eldun of Dernewie, Galtownſide, Galtownſide Haugh, and Galtownſide Wood, and many privileges in the foreſts of Selkirk and Traquair; particularly betwixt Galla and Leeder. The charter alſo expreſſes, that theſe lands had been peram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulated by the King in perſon, accompanied by Prince Henry, with Richard the firſt Abbot. The date of this charter is the ſecond year after Stephen of Boloign, King of England, was taken priſoner, which muſt be in the year 1143. The witneſſes are Hogo de Moreville, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de Somerville, Gervaſus Riddel, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The date of the foundation appears in this monkiſh diſtich:
<q>
                     <l>"Anno Milleno centeno terquoque deno</l>
                     <l>"Et ſexto Chriſti, Melroſe fundita fuiſti."</l>
                  </q>
By the foundation charter the dedication appears to be <hi>Deo &amp; ſanctae Mariae de Mailroſs &amp; Monachis ibidem deo ſervientibus de Riavallis, &amp;c.</hi> of the Ciſtercian order; yet the church was not dedicated till the year 1146.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt Abbot was inſtalled in the year 1136, the year of foundation: he was ſucceeded by <hi>Walterus</hi> or <hi>Waldevus,</hi> a ſon of King David, who was afterwards elected Biſhop of St Andrews, but refuſed Epiſcopacy. To him many miracles were attributed; to relate one will ſuffice:—<q>In a great famine, about 4000 poor people came to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Mailroſs for relief, whom Waldeve the Abbot pitying, he went with his cellarer or butler Tyna to his grange at Heldwii, and then to Gattonſide, and having put in the ſtaff which he carried in his hand among the corn, it was increaſed through the ſign of the croſs, both for the ſupply of the convent and all theſe numerous poor.</q> He received canonization, and many rich offerings were made at his tomb.</p>
               <p>Joceline, a man of great learning, was Abbot here; he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made Biſhop of Glaſgow, but choſe Mailroſs for the place of his interment. One Laurentius was a ſucceeding Abbot; alſo Ranulph, in 1194, who by the Legate of Pope Innocent III. was made Biſhop of Down, in Ireland.</p>
               <p>We find this monaſtery, like all others, very buſy and warm in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular matters. The pious Legate was at Mailroſs to determine a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between this Abbey and Calehow, and to his diſhonour, it is ſaid, he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0085300201:335"/>
took the fee of office, and left the caſe undetermined: and in 1268 the Abbot and a great many of the ſociety and dependents of this monaſtery, were excommunicated by a Council held at Perth, for an affray with the men of Wedale, in which a Clergyman was ſlain, and many perſons wounded.</p>
               <p>In 1206, William the 9th Abbot of Mailroſs died. This was the 48th year after the death of St Waldeve. William was equally eſteemed for his ſanctity, and on his death it was reſolved that their bodies ſhould be laid together. As the workmen were preparing William's grave, brother Robert, who was a Maſon,<note n="*" place="bottom">A Lay Brother.</note> by the incitement of ſome of his aſſociates, but not without reluctance and much religious horror, raiſed the cover of Waldeve's tomb, when there iſſued a fragrance, as if the grave had been filled with ſpices. Being in the gloom of the evening, he brought a candle to the aperture; all who were preſent beheld the ſacred body entire, and all the veſtments as freſh and beautiful as when firſt put on. There were ſix Monks and as many Lay-brothers, who had the happineſs of gratifying their pious though preſumptuous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.<note n="†" place="bottom">Fordun, l. 8. c. 66.</note>

Thoſe who were preſent carried off ſome of the ſmall bones, leaving the reſt to repoſe in peace. One of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was William ſon to the Earl of Dunbar, and nephew to the King, a Knight of great fame. He begged and obtained a tooth of the ſaint, by which he is ſaid to have wrought many cures.</p>

After him Cardinal de Guiſe was nominated, but never inſtalled.</p>
               <p>This monaſtery ſuffered many injuries in the wars between Scotland and England. In the year 1322, it was pillaged by the troops of King Edward II. whoſe inglorious expedition was marked with diſgrace, by the burning this and Dryburgh Abbey, and murdering a company of Monks. King Robert Bruce, for its reſtoration, gave, in the year 1326, 2000l. ſterling, with many forfeited eſtates. King Richard II. again burnt this monaſtery, and in the reign of King Henry VIII. it was pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged and laid waſte. Sir Ralph Ivers and Sir Bryan Layton having obtained a grant of Merſe and Tiviotdale, on their coming to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, were oppoſed by Archibald the 7th Earl of Angus, at Ancrum Moor, and ſuffered a ſhameful defeat. The ground where this battle was fought is called Lilliards Edge, from the ſingular valour of a woman who was on the ſide of the Scotch. Over her place of interment was erected a monument, with this inſcription:
<q>
                     <l>Fair maiden Lilliard lies under this ſtane,</l>
                     <l>Little was her ſtature, but great her fame;</l>
                     <l>On the Engliſh lads ſhe laid many thumps,</l>
                     <l>And when her legs were off ſhe fought upon her ſtumps.</l>

               <p>Mailroſs was a mother church to all of the Ciſtercian order in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The Monks wrote a chronicle of this houſe, beginning at 735, and continued down to 1270. It had many endowments beſides thoſe of King David, particularly by King Alexander II. the family of Stuarts, and others. In the year 1561, the revenue appeared, by the account then taken, to be as follows:

               <p>After the reformation, the abbey of Mailroſs was granted by Queen Mary to James Earl of Bothwell, who forfeited the ſame. It then came to the family of Douglas, one of whom was created Earl of Mortan, under whoſe hands all the evidences of this abbey's poſſeſſions were preſerved, and are now in the cuſtody of that family. A grant was made of it to John Ramſay by King James VI. and confirmed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as a reward for preſerving the King againſt a traiterous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by Lord Gowry. He was created Lord Haddington, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made a peer of England, by the title of Earl of Holderneſſe. It came afterwards to Sir Thomas Hamilton, who was created Earl of Mailroſs in 1619, and aſſumed on that occaſion three roſes in his coat armour: he afterwards took the title of Haddington. The abbey with its demeſnes were lately purchaſed by the family of Buccleugh.</p>
               <p>Many large buildings have ſtood within the walls of the monaſtery, whoſe remains yet appear.</p>
               <p>In returning from Mailroſs, we paſſed</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>NEWSTEAD,</head>
               <p>a little village at the diſtance of about a mile from the abbey, noted for a lodge of Free Maſons, whoſe antiquity is believed to be cotemporary with the monaſtery at leaſt; but ſome preſume to trace it to a much greater diſtance, from its vicinity to the Helton Mountains, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a Druid tribe, whoſe traces are evident to this day. Here are the foundations and remains of a houſe belonging to the Knights Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars, called Red Abbey Stead.</p>
               <p>The name of a peculiar ſpot on the middle Helton Mountain, with a traditional account that it was ſacred to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and was a poſſeſſion of the <hi>Druids,</hi> induced us to viſit theſe lofty hills. We advanced to the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0085300201:338"/>
ſummit of the center hill, a riſe of about a mile and half: the place called <hi>Abor-jo,</hi> of which there is ſuch tradition, engaged us ſome time; our guide ſaid, that in former times it was girt with a grove of oaks, and fenced with a trench and vallum of earth. The veſtiges of the trench remain, but the grove is no more. <hi>Abor</hi> was a name given by the <hi>Amonians</hi> to the great luminary, and ſignifies <hi>the parent of light.</hi> In Mr Bryant's work we have the following definition:—<q>This luminary was alſo called Abor, the parent of light, and his temple Cho-abor. Of this name both a city and river were to be found in Gauzaintis, as well as in Suſiaria and other parts.</q>—<hi>Abor-jo</hi> is an eaſy corruption of <hi>Abor-cho,</hi> being a mere tranſpoſition of the titles.</p>
               <p>On the top of the north-eaſt mountain are the traces of a large en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment. Mr Pennant ſays, on one of theſe hills <q>is a Roman camp, and that he had been informed of others, with military ways to be traced in various places.</q> I am apt to conjecture Mr Pennant took this account from a little pamphlet ſold at Mailroſs, deſcribing that place and its environs, and did not viſit it himſelf. The place hath not the form or appearance of a Roman camp; it has been an occaſional for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, not a permanent one: the climate and expoſure of the ſituation will not allow a conjecture that it was deſigned for a continued ſtrong-hold. The breaſtworks are of earth, defended by moles at irregular diſtances, a mode not practiſed by the Romans. In the beginning of <hi>Ethelwold</hi>'s reign, <hi>Oſwin,</hi> who claimed the crown as his right of inheritance, levied forces to recover it. This was the ſcene of a deciſive engagement; <hi>Oſwin</hi> having fortified himſelf ſtrongly, at length determined to put his claim to the iſſue of battle: the fight conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for three ſucceſſive days, beginning on the 6th of Auguſt, 761; but the event was fatal to <hi>Oſwin</hi> and his adherents, <hi>Oſwin</hi> dying in the field. It is moſt probable theſe fortifications were of the above date, when the diſpoſition of the crown of Northumberland was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the event I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>King Alexander III. levied a great army in 1258, which rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſed at <hi>Mailroſs,</hi> where the King continued ſome time. There is ſcarce an eminence on theſe borders, but what bears the marks of warfare. From the north-eaſt eminence there is a moſt extenſive and beautiful proſpect, commanding all the vale of Tweed down to Berwick, a fine though diſtant view of Tiviotdale; the northern and weſtern views are rugged and mountainous.</p>
