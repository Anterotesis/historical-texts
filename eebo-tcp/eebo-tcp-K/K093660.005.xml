            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am ſitting down to begin the taſk of adding a new volume to theſe eſſays, when the laſt day of the year 1789 is within a few hours of its concluſion, and I ſhall bid farewell to this eventful period with a grateful mind for its having paſſed lightly over my head without any extraordinary perturbation or misfortune on my part ſuffered, gently leading me towards that deſtined and not far diſtant hour, when I, like it, ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>I have accompanied it through all thoſe changes and ſucceſſions of ſeaſons, which in our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0600700105:8"/>
climate are ſo ſtrongly diſcriminated; have ſhared in the pleaſures and productions of each, and if any little idle jars or bickerings may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally have ſtarted up betwixt us, as will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen to the beſt of friends, I willingly conſign them to oblivion, and keep in mind only thoſe kind and good offices, which will pleaſe on reflection, and ſerve to endear the memory of the deceaſed.</p>
            <p>All days in twelve months will not be days of ſunſhine; but I will ſay this for <hi>my friend in his laſt moments,</hi> that I cannot put my finger upon one in the ſame century, that hath given birth to more intereſting events, been a warmer advocate for the liberties and rights of mankind in general, or a kinder patron to this country in particular: I could name a day (if there was any need to point out what is ſo ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on our hearts) a day of gratulation and thankſgiving, which will ever ſtand forth amongſt the whiteſt in our calendar.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Hic dies verè mihi feſtus atras</l>
               <l>Eximet curas: ego nec tumultum,</l>
               <l>Nec mori per vim metuam, tenente</l>
               <l>Caeſare terras.</l>

            <q>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0600700105:9"/>
               <l>This is indeed a feſtal day,</l>
               <l>A day that heals my cares and pains,</l>
               <l>Drives death and danger far away,</l>
               <l>And tells me—Caeſar lives and reigns.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Though <hi>my friend in his laſt moments</hi> hath in this and other inſtances been ſo conſiderate of our happineſs, I am afraid he is not likely to leave our morals much better than he found them: I cannot ſay that in the courſe of my duty as an <hi>Obſerver</hi> any very ſtriking inſtance of amendment hath come under my notice; and though I have all the diſpoſition in life to ſpeak as favourably in my friend's behalf as truth will let me, I am bound to confeſs he was not apt to think ſo ſeriouſly of his latter end as I could have wiſhed: there was a levity in his conduct, which he took no pains to conceal; he did not ſeem to reflect upon the lapſe of time, how ſpeedily his <hi>ſpring, ſummer,</hi> and <hi>autumn</hi> would paſs away and the <hi>winter</hi> of his days come upon him; like <hi>Wolſey</hi> he was not aware how ſoon the <hi>froſt, the killing froſt would nip his root:</hi> he was however a gay convivial fellow, loved his bottle and his friend, paſſed his time peaceably amongſt us, and certainly merits the good word of every loyal ſubject in this kingdom.</p>
            <p>As for his proceedings in other countries, it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0600700105:10"/>
is not here the reader muſt look for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them; politics have no place in theſe volumes; but it cannot be denied that he has made many widows and orphans in Europe, been an active agent for the court of death, and dipped his hands deep in Chriſtian and Mahometan blood. By the friends of freedom he will be celebrated to the lateſt time. He has begun a buſineſs, which, if followed up by his ſucceſſor with equal zeal, leſs ferocity and more diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may lead to wonderful revolutions: there are indeed ſome inſtances of cruelty, which bear hard upon his character; if ſeparately viewed, they admit of no palliation; in a general light, allowances may be made for that phrenſy, which ſeizes the mind, when impelled to great and arduous undertakings; when the wound is gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grened the inciſion muſt be deep, and if that is to be done by coarſe inſtruments and unſkilful hands, who can wonder if the gaſh more reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the ſtab of an aſſaſſin than the operation of a ſurgeon? An aera is now opened, awful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and ſo involved in myſtery, that the acuteſt ſpeculation cannot penetrate to the iſſue of it: In ſhort, <hi>my friend in his laſt moments</hi> hath put a vaſt machine in motion, and left a taſk to futurity, that will demand the ſtrongeſt hands
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0600700105:11"/>
and ableſt heads to compleat: in the mean time I ſhall hope that my countrymen, who have all thoſe bleſſings by inheritance, which leſs-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured nations are now ſtruggling to obtain by force, will ſo uſe their liberty, that the reſt of the world, who are not ſo happy, may think it an object worth contending for, and quote our peace and our proſperity as the beſt proofs exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of its real value.</p>
            <p>Whilſt my thoughts have been thus employed in reflecting upon the laſt day of an ever-memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable year, I have compoſed a few elegiac lines to be thrown into the grave, which time is now opening to receive his reliques.</p>

            <head>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> CXXVII.</head>
            <p>I Am under promiſe to reſume the hiſtory of my friend Ned Drowſy, from which I was obliged to break off in my laſt volume, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 122. The events, which have ſince occurred, ſhall now be related.</p>
            <p>The reader will perhaps recollect that the worthy Hebrew, who aſſumes the name of Abrahams, had juſt concluded the narrative of his adventures, and that the next morning was appointed for a conciliatory interview between Mrs. Goodiſon and her father. Ned, whoſe natural indolence had now began to give place to the moſt active of all paſſions, had been ſo much agitated by the events of the day, that we had no ſooner parted from honeſt Abrahams, than he began to comment upon the lucky incident of our rencontre with the old gentleman at the comedy; he ſeemed ſtrongly inclined to deal with deſtiny for ſome certain impulſes, which he remembered to have felt, when he was ſo earneſt to go to the play; and declared with much gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that he went thither fully prepoſſeſſed ſome good fortune would turn up:
<q rend="inline">"Well, to be ſure,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">"I ought to rejoice in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0600700105:15"/>
happy turn affairs have now taken, and I do rejoice; but it would have given me infinite delight to have fulfilled the plan I had in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for Mrs. Goodiſon's accommodation; ſhe will now want no aſſiſtance from me; my little cottage will never have the honour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her; all thoſe ſchemes are at an end; Conſtantia too will be a great fortune, ſhe will have higher views in life, and think no more of me; or, if ſhe did, it is not to be ſuppoſed her grandfather, who ſo bitterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his daughter's match, will ſuffer her to fall into the offence."</q>
I muſt confeſs I thought ſo entirely with my friend Ned in the concluding part of theſe remarks, that I could only adviſe him to wait the event of time, and recommend himſelf in the mean while as well as he could to Mr. Somerville, the grandfather of Conſtantia. Art and education, it is true, had not contributed much to Ned's accompliſhments, but nature had done great things in his favour; to a perſon admirably, though not finically, formed, ſhe had given a moſt intereſting ſet of features, with ſuch a ſtriking character of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and open honeſty, that he might be ſaid to carry his heart in his countenance: though there was a kind of laſſitude in his deportment,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0600700105:16"/>
the effect of habits long indulged, yet his ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was ever ready to ſtart forth upon the firſt call, and on thoſe occaſions no one would have regretted that he had not been trained in the ſchool of the graces; there was ſomething then diſplayed, which they cannot teach, and only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in her happieſt moments can beſtow.</p>
            <p>The next morning produced a letter from honeſt Abrahams, full of joy for the happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation now eſtabliſhed, and inviting us to celebrate the day with Mrs. Somerville and the ladies at his houſe. This was an anxious criſis for my friend Ned; and I perceived his mind in ſuch a ſtate of agitation, that I thought fit to ſtay with him for the reſt of the forenoon: he began to form a variety of conjectures as to the reception he was likely to meet from the old gentleman, with no leſs a variety of plans for his own behaviour, and even of ſpeeches with which he was to uſher in his firſt addreſſes; ſometimes he ſunk into melancholy and deſpair, at other times he would ſnatch a gleam of hope, and talk him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into tranſports; he was now, for the firſt time in his life, ſtudiouſly contriving how to ſet off his perſon to the beſt advantage; his hair was faſhionably dreſt, and a handſome new ſuit was tried on, during which he ſurveyed himſelf in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0600700105:17"/>
glaſs with ſome attention, and, as I thought, not entirely without a ſecret ſatisfaction, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I have ſeen other gentlemen beſtow upon their perſons in a much greater degree, with much leſs reaſon for their excuſe.</p>
            <p>When he was compleatly equipt, and the time approached for our going, <q rend="inline">"Alas!"</q> he cried,
<q rend="inline">"what does all this ſignify? I am but a clown in better clothes. Why was my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo neglectful of my education, or rather why was I ſo negligent to avail myſelf of the little he allowed me? What would I not give to redeem the time I have thrown away! But 'tis in vain: I have neither wit to recommend myſelf, nor addreſs to diſguiſe my want of it; I have nothing to plead in my favour, but common honour and honeſty; and what cares that old hard-hearted fellow for qualities, which could not reconcile him to his own ſon-in-law? he will certainly look upon me with contempt. As for Conſtantia, gratitude, perhaps, might in time have diſpoſed her heart towards me, and my zealous ſervices might have induced her mother to overlook my deficiencies, but there is an end of that only chance I had for happineſs, and I am a fool to thruſt myſelf into a ſociety, where I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0600700105:18"/>
am ſure to heap freſh fuel on my paſſion, and freſh misfortunes on my head."</q>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe impreſſions, which I could only ſooth but not diſpel, Ned proceeded to the place of meeting with an aching heart and dejected countenance. We found the whole party aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to receive us, and though my friend's embarraſſment diſabled him from uttering any one of the ready-made ſpeeches he had digeſted for the purpoſe, yet I ſaw nothing in Mr. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merville's countenance or addreſs, that could augur otherwiſe than well for honeſt Ned; Mrs. Goodiſon was as gracious as poſſible, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia's ſmile was benignity itſelf. Honeſt Abrahams, who has all the hoſpitality, as well as virtues of his forefathers the patriarchs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us with open arms, and a face in which-wide-mouthed joy grinned moſt delectably. It was with pleaſure I obſerved Mr. Somerville's grateful attentions towards him and his good dame; they had nothing of oſtentation or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in them, but ſeemed the genuine effuſions of his heart; they convinced me he was not a man innately moroſe, and that the reſentment, ſo long foſtered in his boſom, was effectually extirpated. Mrs. Abrahams, in her province, had exerted herſelf to very good purpoſe, and ſpread her board,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0600700105:19"/>
if not elegantly, yet abundantly: Abrahams, on his part, kept his wine and his tongue going with inceſſant gaiety and good-humour, and whilſt he took every opportunity of drawing forth Ned's honeſt heart and natural manners to the beſt advantage, I was happy in diſcovering that they did not eſcape the intuition of Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, and that he made faſter progreſs towards his good opinion, than if he had exhibited better breeding and leſs ſincerity of character.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of the evening the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told us he had determined upon taking his daughter and Conſtantia into the country with him, where he flattered himſelf Mrs. Goodiſon would recover her health and ſpirits ſooner than in town, and at the ſame time gave us all in turn a preſſing invitation to his houſe. Abrahams and his wife excuſed themſelves on the ſcore of buſineſs; but Ned, who had no ſuch plea to make, nor any diſpoſition to invent one, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted the propoſal.</p>
            <p>The day ſucceeding, and ſome few others, were paſſed by Mrs. Goodiſon and Conſtantia at Mr. Somerville's in the neceſſary preparations and arrangements previous to their leaving Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; during this time Ned's diffidence and their occupations did not admit of any interview, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0600700105:20"/>
their departure was only announced to him by a note from the old gentleman, reminding him of his engagement: his ſpirits were by this time ſo much lowered from their late elevation, that he even doubted if he ſhould accept the invitation: love however took care to ſettle this point in his own favour, and Ned arrived at the place of his deſtination rather as a victim under the power of a hopeleſs paſſion, than as a modern fine gentleman with the aſſuming airs of a conqueror. The charms of the beautiful Conſtantia, which had drawn her indolent admirer ſo much out of his character and ſo far from his home, now heightened by the happy reverſe of her ſituation, and ſet off with all the aids of dreſs, dazzled him with their luſtre; and though her change of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and appearance was not calculated to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his paſſion, it ſeemed to forbid his hopes: in ſorrow, poverty and dependance ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him with the generous ambition of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing her from a ſituation ſo ill proportioned to her merits, and, though he had not actually made, he had very ſeriouſly meditated a propoſal of marriage: He ſaw her now in a far different point of view, and comparing her with himſelf, her beauty, fortune and accompliſhments with his own conſcious deficiencies, he ſunk into deſpair.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0600700105:21"/>
This was not unobſerved by Conſtantia, neither did ſhe want the penetration to diſcern the cauſe of it. When he had dragged on this wretched exiſtence for ſome days, he found the pain of it no longer ſupportable, and, aſhamed of wearing a face of woe in the houſe of happineſs, he took the hardy reſolution of bidding farewell to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia and his hopes for ever.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was meditating upon this painful ſubject one evening during a ſolitary walk, he was ſurprized to hear himſelf accoſted by the very perſon, from whoſe chains he had determined to break looſe; Conſtantia was unattended, the place was retired, the hour was ſolemn and her looks were ſoft and full of compaſſion. What cannot love effect? it inſpired him with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpeak; it did more, it ſupplied him with eloquence to expreſs his feelings.</p>
            <p>Conſtantia in few words gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that ſhe rightly gueſſed the ſituation of his mind; this at once drew from him a confeſſion of his love and his deſpair—of the former he ſpoke little and with no diſplay; he neither ſought to recommend his paſſion, or excite her pity; of his own defects he ſpoke more at large, and dwelt much upon his want of education; he reproached himſelf for the habitual indolence of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0600700105:22"/>
his diſpoſition, and then, for the firſt time, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes from the ground, he turned them on Conſtantia, and after a pauſe exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">"Thank Heaven! you are reſtored to a condition, which no longer ſubjects you to the poſſible ſacrifice I had once the audacity to hint at. Conſcious as I am of my own unworthineſs at all times to aſpire to ſuch a propoſal, let me do myſelf the juſtice to declare that my heart was open to you in the pureſt ſenſe; that to have tendered an aſylum to your beloved mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without enſnaring your heart by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, would ſtill have been the pride of my life, and I as truly abhorred to exact, as you could diſdain to grant, an intereſted ſurrender of your hand: and now, lovely Conſtantia, when I am about to leave you in the boſom of proſperity, if I do not ſeem to part from you with all that unmixt felicity, which your good fortune ought to inſpire, do not reproach me for my unhappy weakneſs; but recollect for once in your life, that your charms are irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and my ſoul only too ſuſceptible of their power and too far plunged into deſpair, to admit of any happineſs hereafter."</q>
            </p>
            <p>At the concluſion of this ſpeech Ned again fixt his eyes on the ground; after a ſhort ſilence,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0600700105:23"/>
               <q rend="inline">"I perceive,"</q> replied Conſtantia,
<q rend="inline">"that my obſervations of late were rightly formed, and you have been torturing your mind with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections very flattering to me, but not very juſt towards yourſelf: believe me, Sir, your opinion is as much too exalted in one caſe, as it is too humble in the other. As for me, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet ſeen little of the world but its mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and being indebted to the benevolence of human nature for ſupporting me under them, I ſhall ever look to that principle as a greater recommendation in the character of a companion for life, than the moſt brilliant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents or moſt elegant accompliſhments: in the quiet walks of life I ſhall expect to find my enjoyments."</q>
Here Ned ſtarted from his reverie, a gleam of joy ruſhed upon his heart, by an involuntary motion he had graſped one of her hands; ſhe perceived the tumult her words had created, and extricating her hand from his—<q rend="inline">"Permit me,"</q> ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"to qualify my reſpect for a benevolent diſpoſition by remarking to you, that without activity there can be no vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: I will explain myſelf more particularly; I will ſpeak to you with the ſincerity of a friend—You are bleſt with excellent natural endowments, a good heart and a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0600700105:24"/>
you have nothing to do but to ſhake off an indolent habit, and, having youth at your command, to employ the one and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the other: the means of doing this it would be preſumption in me to preſcribe, but as my grandfather is a man well acquainted with the world and fully qualified to give advice, I ſhould earneſtly recommend to you not to take a haſty departure before you have conſulted him, and I may venture to promiſe you will never repent of any confidence you may repoſe in his friendſhip and diſcretion."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here Conſtantia put an end to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and turned towards the houſe; Ned ſtood fixt in deep reflection, his mind ſometimes brightening with hope, ſometimes relapſing into deſpair: his final determination, however, was to obey Conſtantia's advice and ſeek an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with Mr. Somerville.</p>

         <div n="128" type="essay">
            <head>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> CXXVIII.</head>
            <p>THE next morning, as ſoon as Ned and Mr. Somerville met, the old gentleman took him into his library, and when he was ſeated,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0600700105:25"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">"I ſhall ſave you ſome embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment if I begin our conference by telling you that I am well appriſed of your ſentiments towards my Conſtantia; I ſhall make the ſame haſte to put you out of ſuſpenſe by aſſuring you that I am not unfriendly to your wiſhes."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was an opening of ſuch unexpected joy to Ned, that his ſpirits had nearly ſunk under the ſurprize; he ſtared wildly without power of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, ſcarce venturing to credit what he had heard; the blood ruſhed into his cheeks, and Somerville, ſeeing his diſorder, proceeded:
<q rend="inline">"When I have ſaid this on my own part, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, young gentleman, that I only engage not to obſtruct your ſucceſs, I do not, nay I cannot, undertake to enſure it: that muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Conſtantia; permit me to add, it muſt depend upon yourſelf."</q>
Here Ned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuppreſs his tranſports, eagerly demanded what there could be in his power to do, that might advance him in the good opinion and eſteem of Conſtantia; ſuch was his gratitude to the old gentleman for his kindneſs, that he could ſcarce refrain from throwing himſelf at his feet, and he implored him inſtantly to point out the happy means, which he would implicitly embrace, were they every ſo difficult, ever ſo dangerous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0600700105:26"/>
               <q rend="inline">"There will be neither hardſhip nor hazard,"</q> replied Mr. Somerville,
<q rend="inline">"in what I ſhall adviſe. Great things may be accompliſhed in a ſhort time, where the diſpoſition is good and the underſtanding apt: though your father neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected your education, it is no reaſon you ſhould neglect yourſelf; you muſt ſhake off your indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and as the firſt ſtep neceſſary towards your future comfort is to put yourſelf at eaſe in point of fortune, you muſt make yourſelf maſter of your own eſtate; that I ſuſpect can only be done by extricating your affairs from the hands they are in; but as this is a buſineſs, that will require the aſſiſtance of an honeſt and able agent, I ſhall recommend to you my own lawyer, on whoſe integrity you may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely rely; he will ſoon reduce your affairs to ſuch a ſyſtem of regularity, that you will find it an eaſy buſineſs, and when you diſcover how many ſources of future happineſs it opens to you, you will purſue it as an employment of no leſs pleaſure than advantage."</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this good advice Ned promiſed the fulleſt and moſt unreſerved obedience; Mr. Somerville reſumed his ſubject and proceeded:
<q rend="inline">"When you have thus laid the foundation in oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, what remains to be done will be a taſk
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0600700105:27"/>
of pleaſure: this will conſiſt in, furniſhing your mind and enlarging your experience, in ſhort, Sir, rubbing off the ruſt of indolence and the prejudices of a narrow education: now for this important undertaking I have a friend in my eye, whoſe underſtanding, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, morals and manners qualify him to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you moſt eſſential ſervices: with this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and inſtructive companion I ſhould in the firſt place recommend you to take a tour through the moſt intereſting parts of your own country, and hereafter, as occaſion ſhall ſerve, you may, or you may not, extend your travels into other countries: this is the beſt counſel I have to give you, and I tender it with all poſſible good wiſhes for your ſucceſs."</q>
            </p>
            <p>A plan, propoſed with ſo much cordiality and holding forth ſuch a reward for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its conditions, could not fail to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with ardour by the late deſpairing lover of Conſtantia. The worthy lawyer was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the undertaking, and Ned was all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to convince Mr. Somerville, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence was no longer his ruling defect. He gave inſtant orders for his journey, and then flew to Conſtantia, at whoſe feet he poured
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0600700105:28"/>
forth the humble, yet ardent, acknowledgments of a heart overflowing with gratitude and love: it ſeemed as if love's arrow, like <hi>Ithuriel</hi>'s ſpear, poſſeſſed the magic powers of transformation with a touch: there was a ſpirit in his eyes, an energy in his motions, an illumination over his whole perſon, that gave his form and features a new caſt: Conſtantia ſaw the ſudden transformation with ſurprize, and as it evinced the flexibility of his nature and the influence of her own charms, ſhe ſaw it alſo with delight: <q rend="inline">"So ſoon!"</q> was her only reply, when he announced his immediate depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but thoſe words were uttered with ſuch a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and accompanied by ſuch a look, as to the eye and ear of love conveyed more meaning than volumes would contain, unaided by ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—<q rend="inline">"Yes, adorable Conſtantia,"</q> he exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">"I am now ſetting forth to give the earlieſt proof in my power of a ready and alert obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the dictates of my beſt adviſer; theſe few moments, which your condeſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges me with, are the only moments I ſhall not rigidly devote to the immediate duties of my taſk: inſpired with the hope of returning leſs unworthy of your attention, I chearfully ſubmit to baniſh myſelf from your ſight for a time, content to cheriſh in my heart the lovely
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0600700105:29"/>
image there impreſt, and flattering myſelf I have the ſanction of your good wiſhes for the ſucceſs of my undertaking."</q>
Conſtantia aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him he had her good wiſhes for every hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in life, and, then yielding her hand to him, he tenderly preſſed it to his lips and departed.</p>
            <p>It would be an unintereſting detail to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate the arrangements, which Ned by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of his friendly and judicious agent adopted on his return to Poppy-hall. His affairs had indeed been much neglected, but they were not embarraſſed, ſo that they were eaſily put into ſuch order and regulation, as gave him full leiſure for purſuing other objects of a more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating nature: with this view he returned to his friend Mr. Somerville, and was again bleſt with the preſence of Conſtantia, to whom every day ſeemed to add new graces: he was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed by all parties in the moſt affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; Mr. Somerville, upon converſing with his lawyer, received a very flattering report of Ned's activity and attention, nor was he diſpleaſed to hear from the ſame authority, that his eſtate and property far exceeded any amount, which the unpretending owner himſelf had ever hinted at.</p>
            <p>It was now the latter end of April, and Ned had allowed himſelf only a few days to prepare for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0600700105:30"/>
his tour, and to form an acquaintance with the amiable perſon, who at Mr. Somerville's requeſt had engaged to accompany him; their plan was to employ ſix months in this excurſion through England and part of Scotland, during which they were to viſit the chief towns and principal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactories, and Mr. Somerville had further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to lay out their courſe, ſo as to fall in with the houſes of ſome of his friends by the way, where he had ſecured them a welcome in ſuch ſocieties, as promiſed no leſs profit than amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a young perſon in the purſuit of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Meaſures had been taken to provide equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, ſervants and all things requiſite for a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling eſtabliſhment, amongſt which a few well-ſelected books were not forgotten, and, thus at length equipt, Ned with his companion, on the firſt morning of the month of May, having taken leave of Mr. Somerville and Mrs. Goodiſon, and received a tender adieu from his beloved Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, ſlept reluctantly into his chaiſe, and left the fineſt eyes in the creation to pay the tribute of a tear to the ſorrows of the ſcene.</p>
            <p>From this period I had heard nothing of his proceedings till a few days ago, when I was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by him with the following letter, dated from the houſe of Mr. Somerville:
<floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0600700105:31"/>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I am juſt returned from a ſix months tour, in the courſe of which I have viſited a variety of places and perſons in company with a gentleman, from whoſe pleaſing ſociety I have reaped the higheſt enjoyment, and, if I do not deceive myſelf, no ſmall degree of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Before I ſate out upon this excurſion I had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing my private affairs put in ſuch a train, and arranged upon ſo clear a ſyſtem, that I find myſelf in poſſeſſion of a fund of occupation for the reſt of my days in ſuperintending the concerns of my eſtate, and intereſting myſelf in the welfare and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of every perſon, who depends upon me.</p>
                     <p>When I returned to this charming place, the reception I met with from Mr. Somerville was as flattering as can be conceived; the worthy mother of my beloved Conſtantia was no leſs kind to me; but in what words can I attempt to convey to you the impreſſion I felt on my heart, when I was welcomed with ſmiles of approbation by the ever-adorable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my affection? What tranſport did it give me, when I found her anxious to enquire into every circumſtance, that had occured in the courſe of my travels! none were too mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0600700105:32"/>
for her notice; ſhe ſeemed to take an intereſt in every thing that had happened to me, and our converſations were renewed time after time without wearineſs on her part, or any proſpect of exhauſting our ſubject.</p>
                     <p>At this time I had no other expectation but of a ſecond excurſion with the conductor of the firſt, and as that gentleman was in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent conference with Mr. Somerville, I took for granted they were concerting the plan of a foreign tour; and though my heart was every hour more and more fondly attached to Conſtantia, ſo that a ſeparation from her was painful to reflect on, yet I was reſolved at all events not to ſwerve from my engagements with her grandfather, and therefore held my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in trembling expectation of another ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to go forth: delightfully as the hours paſſed away in her ſociety, I dreaded leſt any ſymptoms of ſelf-indulgence ſhould lower me in her opinion, or create ſuſpicions in Mr. Somerville and Mrs. Goodiſon that I was in any danger of relapſing into my former indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: I therefore ſeized the firſt opportunity of explaining myſelf to thoſe reſpectable friends, when Conſtantia was not preſent, and, addreſſing myſelf to Mr. Somerville, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him that I was not diſpoſed to forget
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0600700105:33"/>
any part of his good advice, nor ſo much my own enemy as to evade any one of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, to the performance of which he had annexed the hope of ſo tranſcendant a reward: conſcious that he could impoſe nothing upon me ſo hard to do, or ſo painful to ſuffer, which ſuch a prize would not infinitely overbalance, I had no other backwardneſs or apprehenſion as to his commands, but what ſprung from the conviction, that after all my efforts I muſt ever remain unworthy of Conſtantia.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall never forget Mr. Somerville's reply, nor the action which accompanied it. My good friend, ſaid he, (leaning over the arm of the chair, and kindly taking me by the hand) it is more than enough for a man to have made one ſuch fatal error in his life as I have done, one ſuch unhappy ſacrifice to the falſe opinions of the world; but though I have heartily repented of this error, I am not ſo far reformed, as to be without ambition in the choice of a huſband for our Conſtantia; no, Sir, I am ſtill as ambitious as ever, but I hope with better judgment and upon better prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: I will not bate an atom of virtue in the bargain I am to make; I inſiſt upon the good qualities of the heart and temper to the laſt ſcruple; theſe are the eſſentials which I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0600700105:34"/>
rigidly exact, and all theſe you poſſeſs; there are indeed other, many other, incidental ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which you may, or you may not, ſuperadd to the account; but I am contented to ſtrike hands with you on the ſpot, though you ſhall never have ſet foot upon foreign ſoil.—What ſays my daughter to this?</p>
                     <p>When I caſt my eyes upon the countenance of the moſt benevolent of women, and ſaw it turned expreſſively upon me, ſmiling through tears, joy palpitated at my heart, whilſt ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered herſelf as follows:—I were of all beings moſt inſenſible, could I withhold my teſtimony to this gentleman's merits, or my entire aſſent to his alliance with my daughter; but as I have ever repoſed perfect confidence in her, and, as far as I was enabled, always conſulted her wiſhes, I ſhould be glad this queſtion might be fairly and candidly referred to her unbiaſſed judgment for deciſion: ſhe is very young; our friend here is neither old in years nor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; both parties have time before them; ſhould ſhe be willing to hold off from the married ſtate for a while, ſhould ſhe foreſee advantages in our friend's undertaking a ſecond tour with the ſame inſtructive aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, (whether into foreign countries or nearer home) let her be the judge of what is moſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0600700105:35"/>
likely to conduce to her future happineſs in a huſband, and as I am perſuaded our friend here will practicſe no unfair meaſures for biaſſing her judgment, let him conſult Conſtantia's wiſhes on the caſe, and as ſhe determines ſo let him act, and ſo let us agree.</p>
                     <p>With theſe inſtructions, which Mr Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville ſeconded, I haſtened to Conſtantia, and without heſitation or diſguiſe related to her what had paſſed and requeſted her deciſion. Judge (if it be poſſible to judge) of my tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports, when that ingenuous, that angelic creature gave me a reply, that left no room to doubt that I was bleſt in the poſſeſſion of her heart, and that ſhe could not endure a ſecond ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>I flew to Mr. Somerville; I fell at the feet of Mrs. Goodiſon; I interceded, implored and was accepted. Nothing ever equalled the generoſity of their behaviour. I am now to change my name to Somerville, at that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gentleman's expreſs deſire, and meaſures are already in train for that purpoſe. The ſame abilities, which I am indebted to for the good condition of my affairs, are employed in perfecting the marriage ſettlement, and the period now between me and happineſs would
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0600700105:36"/>
by any other perſon but myſelf be termed a very ſhort one.</p>
                     <p>Thus am I on the very eve of being bleſt with the lovelieſt, the divineſt object upon earth, and thus have I by the good counſel of my friends (in which number I ſhall ever rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon you) broke the ſhackles of that unmanly indolence, under which I was ſinking apace into irretrievable languor and inſignificance. Henceforward I entreat you to regard me as a new man, and believe that with my name I have put off my infirmity.

                  </opener>
                  <p>THE antient family of the <hi>Saplings,</hi> whereof your humble ſervant is the unworthy repreſentative, has been for many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſtinguiſhed for a certain pliability of temper, which with ſome people paſſes for good-humour, and by others is called weakneſs; but however the world may differ in deſcribing it, there ſeems a general agreement in the manner of making uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Our family eſtate, though far from contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is conſiderably reduced from its antient ſpendor, not only by an unlucky tumble that my grandfather Sir Paul got in the famous Miſſiſippi ſcheme, but alſo by various loſſes, bad debts and incautious ſecurities, which have fallen heavy upon the purſes of my predeceſſors at different times; but as every man muſt pay for his good character, I dare ſay they did not repent of their purchaſe, and for my part it is a reflection that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0600700105:38"/>
never gives me any diſturbance. This aforeſaid grandfather of mine was ſuppoſed to have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Congreve</hi> with the hint for his character of <hi>Sir Paul Pliant,</hi> at leaſt it hath been ſo whiſpered to me very frequently by my aunt Jemima, who was a great collector of family anecdotes; and, to ſpeak the truth, I am not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally without ſuſpicion, that a certain ingenious author, lately deceaſed, had an eye towards my inſignificant ſelf in the dramatic pourtrait of his <hi>Good-natured Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though I ſcorn the notion of ſetting myſelf off to the public and you by panegyrics of my own penning, (as the manner of ſome is) yet I may truly ſay without boaſting, that I had the character at ſchool of being the very beſt <hi>fag</hi> that ever came into it; and this I believe every gentleman, who was my contemporary at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> will do me the juſtice to acknowledge: it was a reputation I confeſs that I did not earn for nothing, for whilſt I worked the clothes off my back and the ſkin off my bones in ſcouting upon every body's errands, I was pummeled to a mummy by the boys, <hi>ſhewed up</hi> by the uſhers, ſlead alive by the maſters and reported for an incorrigible dunce at my book; a report, which under correction I muſt think had ſome degree
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0600700105:39"/>
of injuſtice in it, as it was impoſſible for me to learn a book I was never allowed to open: in this period of my education I took little food and leſs ſleep, ſo that, whilſt I ſhot up in ſtature after the manner of my progenitors, who were a tall race of men, I grew as gaunt as a grey-hound, but having abundantly more ſpirit than ſtrength, and being <hi>voted</hi> by the great boys to to be what is called <hi>True game,</hi> I was ſingled out as a kind of trial-cock, and pitted againſt every new comer to make proof of his bottom in fair fighting, though I may ſafely ſay I never turned out upon a quarrel of my own making in all my life. Notwithſtanding all theſe honours, which I obtained from my colleagues, I will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſguiſe from you that I left the ſchool in diſgrace, being expelled by the maſter, when head of my boarding houſe, for not ſupporting my authority over the petty boys belonging to it, who I muſt confeſs were juſt then not in the moſt orderly and correct ſtate of diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>My father, whoſe maxim it was never to let trifles vex him, received me with all the good humour in life, and admitted me of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Oxford: here I was overjoyed to find that the affair of the expulſion was ſo far from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0600700105:40"/>
having prejudiced my contemporaries againſt me, that I was reſorted to by numbers, whoſe time hung upon their hands, and my rooms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the rendezvous of all the loungers in the college: few or no ſchemes were ſet on foot without me, and if a looſe guinea or two was wanted for the purpoſe, every body knew where to have it: I was allowed a horſe for my health's ſake, which was rather delicate, but I cannot ſay my health was much the better for him, as I never mounted his back above once or twice, whilſt my friends kept him in exerciſe morning and evening, as long as he laſted, which indeed was only till the hunting ſeaſon ſet in, when the currier had his hide, and his fleſh went to the kennel. I muſt own I did not excel in any of my academical exerciſes, ſave that of circumambulating the colleges and public buildings with ſtrangers, who came to gaze about them for curioſity's ſake; in this branch of learning I gained ſuch general reputation as to be honoured with the title of <hi>Keeper of the Lions</hi>: neither will I diſguiſe the frequent <hi>jobations</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred for neglect of college duties, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for non-attendance at chapel, but in this I ſhould not perhaps have been thought ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0600700105:41"/>
had it been known that my ſurplice never failed to be there, though I had rarely the credit of bearing it company.</p>
                  <p>My mother died of a cold ſhe caught by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſome young ladies on a water-party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had been a month in the world; and my father never married again, having promiſed her on her death-bed not to bring a ſtepdame into his family, whilſt I ſurvived: I had the misfortune to loſe him when I was in my twenty-ſecond year; he got his death at a country canvaſs for Sir Harry Oſier, a very obliging gentleman and nearly related to our family: I attended my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's corpſe to the grave, on which melancholy occaſion ſuch were the lamentations and bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of all the ſervants in the houſe, that I thought it but a proper return for their affection to his memory to prove myſelf as kind a maſter by continuing them in their ſeveral employs: this however was not altogether what they meant, as I was ſoon convinced every one amongſt them had a remonſtrance to make and a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to prefer: the butler would have better perquiſites, the footman wanted to be out of livery, the ſcullion demanded tea-money, and the cook murmured about kitchen-ſtuff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0600700105:42"/>Though I was now a ſingle being in the world, my friends and neighbours kindly took care I ſhould not be a ſolitary one; I was young Indeed and of ſmall experience in the world, but I had plenty of counſellors: ſome adviſed me to buy horſes they wanted to ſell, others to ſell horſes they wanted to buy: a lady of great taſte fell in love with two or three of my beſt cows for their colour; they were upon her lawn the next day: a gentleman of extraordinary <hi>virtù</hi> diſcovered a picture or two in my collection, that exactly fitted his pannels: an eminent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover, whom every body declared to be the firſt genius of the age for laying out grounds, had taken meaſures for tranſporting my garden a mile out of my ſight, and floating my richeſt meadow grounds with a lake of muddy water: as for my manſion and its appendages I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded I could never have kept them in their places, had it not been that the ſeveral projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who all united in pulling them down, could never rightly agree in what particular ſpot to build them up again: one kind friend compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented me with the firſt refuſal of a miſtreſs, whom for reaſons of oeconomy he was obliged to part from; and a neighbouring gentlewoman, whoſe daughter had perhaps ſtuck on hand a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0600700105:43"/>
little longer than was convenient, more than hinted to me that Miſs had every requiſite in life to make the married ſtate perfectly happy.</p>
                  <p>In juſtice however to my own diſcretion let me ſay that I was not haſtily ſurprized into a ſerious meaſure by this latter overture, nor did I aſk the young lady's hand in marriage till I was verily perſuaded by her exceſſive fondneſs that there were no other means to ſave her life. Now whether it was the violence of her paſſion before our marriage, that gave ſome ſhock to her intellects, or from what other cauſe it might proceed I know not, certain however it is, that after marriage ſhe became ſubject to very odd whims and caprices, and though I made it a point of humanity never to thwart her in theſe humours, yet I was ſeldom fortunate enough to pleaſe her; ſo that, had I not been ſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that love for me was the cauſe and origin of them all, I might have been ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by appearances as to have imputed them to averſion. She was in the habit of deciding upon almoſt every action in her life by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of her dreams, in which I cannot doubt her great ſkill, though I could not always comprehend the principles, on which ſhe applied it; ſhe never failed, as ſoon as winter ſet in, to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0600700105:44"/>
dream of going to London, and our journey as certainly ſucceeded; I remember upon our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival there the firſt year after our marriage, ſhe dreamt of a new coach, and at the ſame time put the ſervants in new liveries, the colours and pattern of which were circumſtantially revealed to her in ſleep: ſometimes, (dear creature!) ſhe dreamt of winning large ſums at cards, but I am apt to think thoſe dreams were of the ſort, which ſhould have been interpreted by their contraries: ſhe was not a little fond of running after conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and deaf and dumb fortune tellers, who dealt in figures and caſt nativities; and when we were in the country my barns and outhouſes were haunted with gypſies and vagabonds, who made ſad havoc with our pigs and poultry: of ghoſts and evil ſpirits ſhe had ſuch terror, that I was fain to keep a chaplain in my houſe to exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the chambers, and when buſineſs called me from home, the good man condeſcended ſo far to her fears, as to ſleep in a little cloſet within her call in caſe ſhe was troubled in the night; and I muſt ſay this for my friend, that if there is any truſt to be put in fleſh and blood, he was a match for the beſt ſpirit that ever walked: ſhe had all the ſenſibility in life towards omens and prognoſtics, and though I guarded every motion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0600700105:45"/>
and action, that mighty give any poſſible alarm to her, yet my unhappy awkwardneſſes were always boding ill luck, and I had the grief of heart to hear her declare in her laſt moments, that a capital overſight I had been guilty of in handing to her a candle with an enormous winding-ſheet appending to it was the immediate occaſion of her death and my irreparable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond wife I married in mere charity and compaſſion, becauſe a young fellow, whom ſhe was engaged to, had played her a baſe trick by ſcandalouſly breaking off the match, when the wedding clothes were bought, the day appointed for the wedding and myſelf invited to it. Such tranſactions ever appeared ſhocking to me, and therefore to make up her loſs to her as well as I was able, I put myſelf to extraordinary charges for providing her with every thing handſome upon our marriage: ſhe was a fine woman, loved ſhew and was particularly fond of diſplaying her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in public places, where ſhe had an opportunity of meeting and mortifying the young man, who had behaved ſo ill to her: ſhe took this revenge againſt him ſo often, that one day to my great ſurprize I diſcovered that ſhe had eloped from me and fairly gone off with him. There was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0600700105:46"/>
ſomething ſo unhandſome, as I thought, in this proceeding, that I ſhould probably have taken legal meaſures for redreſs, as in like caſes other huſbands have done, had I not been diverted from my purpoſe by a very civil note from the gentleman himſelf, wherein he ſays—<q rend="inline">"That being a younger ſon of little or no fortune, he hopes I am too much of a gentleman to think of reſorting to the vexatious meaſures of the law for revenging myſelf upon him; and, as a proof of his readineſs to make me all the reparation in his power in an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way, he begs leave to inform me, that he ſhall moſt reſpectfully attend upon me with either ſword or piſtols, or with both, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall be pleaſed to lay my commands upon him for a meeting, and appoint the hour and place."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After ſuch atonement on the part of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I could no longer harbour any thoughts of a divorce, eſpecially as my younger brother the parſon has heirs to continue the family, and ſeems to think ſo entirely with me in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I have determined to drop it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and give the parties no further moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, as my brother very properly obſerves, it is the part of a chriſtian to forget and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0600700105:47"/>
and in truth I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould diſturb them in their enjoyments, or return evil for good to an obliging gentleman, who has taken a taſk of trouble off my hands, and ſet me at my eaſe for the reſt of my days; in which tranquil and contented ſtate of mind, as becomes a man, whoſe inheritance is philanthropy, and whoſe mother's milk hath been the milk of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kindneſs, I remain in all brotherly charity and good will,</p>

                  <head>TO THE OBSERVER.</head>
                  <p>AS I have lived long enough to repent of a fatal propenſity, that has led me to commit many offences, not the leſs irkſome to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0600700105:48"/>
feelings for the ſecrecy, with which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to execute them, and as theſe can now be no otherwiſe atoned for than by a frank confeſſion, I have reſolved upon this mode of addreſſing myſelf to you. Few people chuſe to diſplay their own characters to the world in ſuch colours as I ſhall give to mine, but as I have mangled ſo many reputations in my time without mercy, I ſhould be the meaneſt of mankind if I ſpared my own; and being now about to ſpeak of a perſon, whom no man loves, I may give vent to an acrimony, at which no man can take offence. If I have been troubleſome to others, I am no leſs uncomfortable to myſelf, and amidſt vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without number the greateſt of all is, that there is not one, which does not originate from myſelf.</p>
                  <p>I entered upon life with many advantages na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and acquired; I am indebted to my parents for a liberal education, and to nature for no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſhare of talents: my propenſities were not ſuch as betrayed me into diſſipation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance: my mind was habitually of a ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous caſt; I had a paſſion for books, and began to collect them at an early period of my life: to them I devoted the greateſt portion of my time, and had my vanity been of a ſort to be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0600700105:49"/>
contented with the literary credit I had now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, I had been happy; but I was ambitious of convincing the world I was not the idle owner of weapons, which I did not know the uſe of; I ſeized every ſafe opportunity of making my pretenſions reſpected by ſuch dabblers in the belles lettres, who paid court to me, and as I was ever cautious of ſtepping an inch beyond my tether on theſe occaſions, I ſoon found myſelf credited for more learning, than my real ſtock amounted to. I received all viſitors in my library, affected a ſtudious air, and took care to furniſh my table with volumes of a ſelect ſort; upon theſe I was prepared to deſcant, if by chance a curious friend took up any one of them, and as there is little ſame to be got by treading in the beaten track of popular opinion, I ſometimes took the liberty to be eccentric and paradoxical in my criticiſms and cavils, which gained me great reſpect from the ignorant, (for upon ſuch only I took care to practiſe this chicanery) ſo that in a ſhort time I became a ſovereign dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor within a certain ſet, who looked up to me for ſecond hand opinions in all matters of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary taſte, and ſaw myſelf inaugurated by my flatterers cenſor of all new publications.</p>
                  <p>My trumpeters had now made ſuch a noiſe in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0600700105:50"/>
the world, that I began to be in great requeſt, and men of real literature laid out for my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; but here I acted with a coldneſs, that was in me conſtitutional as well as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential: I was reſolved not to riſk my laurels, and throw away the fruits of a triumph ſo cheaply purchaſed: ſolicitations, that would have flattered others, only alarmed me; ſuch was not the ſociety I delighted in; againſt ſuch attacks I entrenched myſelf with the moſt jealous caution: If however by accident I was drawn out of my faſtneſſes, and trapped unawares into an ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade of wicked wits, I armed myſelf to meet them with a triple tier of ſmiles; I primed my lips with ſuch a ready charge of flattery, that when I had once engaged them in the pleaſing contemplation of their own merits, they were ſeldom diſpoſed to ſcrutinize into mine, and thus in general I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to eſcape undetected. Though it was no eaſy matter to extort an opinion from me in ſuch companies, yet ſometimes I was unavoidably entangled in converſation, and then I was forced to have recourſe to all my addreſs; happily my features were habituated to a ſmile of the moſt convertible ſort, for it would anſwer the purpoſes of affected humility as well as thoſe of actual contempt, to which in truth it was more conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0600700105:51"/>
my opinion, therefore, upon any point of controverſy flattered both parties and befriended neither; it was calculated to impreſs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with an idea that I knew much more than I profeſt to know; it was in ſhort ſo inſinuating, ſo ſubmitted, ſo heſitating, that a man muſt have had the heart of Nero to have perſecuted a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo abſolutely inoffenſive: but theſe ſacrifices coſt me dear, for they were foreign to my nature, and, as I hated my ſuperiors, I avoided their ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Having ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed myſelf as a critic, I now began to meditate ſome ſecret at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts as an author; but in theſe the ſame cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attended me, and my performances did not riſe above a little ſonnet, or a parody, which I circulated through a few hands without a name, prepared to diſavow it, if it was not applauded to my wiſhes: I alſo wrote occaſional eſſays and paragraphs for the public prints, by way of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my talents in various kinds of ſtile; by theſe experiments I acquired a certain facility of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating other people's manner and diſguiſing my own, and ſo far my point was gained; but as for the ſecret ſatisfaction I had promiſed myſelf in hearing my productions applauded, of that I was altogether diſappointed; for though I tried both
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0600700105:52"/>
praiſe and diſpraiſe for the purpoſe of bringing them into notice, I never had the pleaſure to be contradicted by any man in the latter caſe, or ſeconded by a living ſoul in the former: I had circulated a little poem, which coſt me ſome pains, and as I had been flattered with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe it gained from ſeveral of its readers, I put it one evening in my pocket, and went to the houſe of a certain perſon, who was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to by men of genius: an opportunity luckily offered for producing my manuſcript, which I was prepared to avow as ſoon as the company preſent had given ſentence in its favour: it was put into the hands of a dramatic author of ſome celebrity, who read it aloud, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I thought that clearly anticipated his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt: as ſoon therefore as he had finiſhed it and demanded of me if I knew the author, I had no heſitation to declare that I did not—Then I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, rejoined he, it is no offence to ſay I think it the mereſt traſh I ever read—None in life, I replied, and from that moment held him in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting hatred.</p>
                  <p>Diſguſted with the world I now began to dip my pen in gall, and as ſoon as I had ſingled out a proper object for my ſpleen, I looked round him for his weak ſide, where I could place a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0600700105:53"/>
blow to beſt effect, and wound him undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: the author abovementioned had a full ſhare of my attention; he was an irritable man, and I have ſeen him agonized with the pain, which my very ſhafts had given him, whilſt I was foremoſt to arraign the ſcurrility of the age and encourage him to diſregard it: the practiſe I had been in of maſking my ſtile facilitated my attacks upon every body, who either moved my envy, or provoked my ſpleen.</p>
                  <p>The meaneſt of all paſſions had now taken entire poſſeſſion of my heart, and I ſurrendered myſelf to it without a ſtruggle: ſtill there was a conſciouſneſs about me, that ſunk me in my own eſteem, and when I met the eye of a man, whom I had ſecretly defamed; I felt abaſhed ſociety became painful to me; and I ſhrunk into retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for my ſelf-eſteem was loſt; though I had gratified my malice, I had deſtroyed my comfort; I now contemplated myſelf a ſolitary being at the very moment when I had every requiſite of fortune, health and endowments to have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me to the world, and to thoſe tender ties and engagements, which are natural to man and conſtitute his beſt enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>The ſolitude, I reſorted to, made me every day more moroſe, and ſupplied me with reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0600700105:54"/>
that rendered me intolerable to myſelf and unfit for ſociety. I had reaſon to apprehend, in ſpite of all my caution, that I was now narrowly watched, and that ſtrong ſuſpicions were taken up againſt me; when as I was feaſting my jaundiced eye one morning with a certain newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper, which I was in the habit of employing as the vehicle of my venom, I was ſtartled at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering myſelf conſpicuouſly pointed out in an angry column as a cowardly defamer, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced with perſonal chaſtiſement, as ſoon as ever proofs could be obtained againſt me; and this threatening denunciation evidently came from the very author, who had unknowingly given me ſuch umbrage, when he recited my poem.</p>
                  <p>The ſight of this reſentful paragraph was like an arrow to my brain: habituated to ſkirmiſh only behind entrenchments, I was ill prepared to turn into the open field, and had never put the queſtion to my heart, how it was provided for the emergency: In early life I had not any reaſon to ſuſpect my courage, nay it was rather forward to meet occaſions in thoſe days of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; but the meanneſs, I had lately ſunk into, had ſapped every manly principle of my nature, and I now diſcovered to my ſorrow, that in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0600700105:55"/>
up the lurking malice of an aſſaſſin, I had loſt the gallant ſpirit of a gentleman.</p>
                  <p>There was ſtill one alleviation to my terrors: it ſo chanced that I was not the author of the particular libel, which my accuſer had imputed to me; and though I had been father of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand others, I felt myſelf ſupported by truth in almoſt the only charge, againſt which I could have fairly appealed to it. It ſeemed to me therefore adviſeable to loſe no time in diſculpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf from the accuſation, yet to ſeek an interview with this iraſcible man was a ſervice of ſome danger: chance threw the opportunity in my way, which I had probably elſe wanted ſpirit to invite; I accoſted him with all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able civility and made the ſtrongeſt aſſeverations of my innocence: whether I did this with a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility that might aggravate his ſuſpicions, or that he had others impreſſed upon him beſides thoſe I was labouring to remove, ſo it was, that he treated all I ſaid with the moſt contemptuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity, and elevating his voice to a tone, that petrified me with fear, bade me avoid his fight, threatening me both by words and actions in a manner too humiliating to relate.</p>
                  <p>Alas! can words expreſs my feelings? Is there a being more wretched than myſelf? to be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0600700105:56"/>
friendleſs, an exile from ſociety and at enmity with myſelf is a ſituation deplorable in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme: let what I have now written be made public; if I could believe my ſhame would be turned to others' profit, it might perhaps become leſs painful to myſelf; if men want other motives to divert them from defamation, than what their own hearts ſupply, let them turn to my example, and if they will not be reaſoned, let them be frightened out of their propenſity.</p>

            <p>The caſe of this correſpondent is a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly one, and I have admitted his letter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I do not doubt the preſent good motives of the writer; but I ſhall not eaſily yield a place in theſe eſſays to characters ſo diſguſting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations ſo derogatory to human nature. The hiſtorians of the day, who profeſs to give us intelligence of what is paſſing in the world, ought not to be condemned, if they ſometimes make a little free with our ſoibles and our follies; but downright libels are grown too dangerous, and ſcurrility is become too dull to find a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; the pillory is a great reformer.

            <p>I Am bewildered by the definitions, which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical writers give us of the human paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: I can underſtand the characters of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus,</hi> and am entertained by his ſketches; but when your profound thinkers take the ſubject in hand, they appear to me to dive to the bottom of the deep in ſearch of that, which floats upon its ſurface: if a man in the heat of anger would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0600700105:59"/>
the movements of his mind, he might paint the tempeſt to the life; but as ſuch deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not to be expected, moral eſſayiſts have ſubſtituted perſonification in their place, and by the pleaſing introduction of a few natural inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents form a kind of little drama, in which they make their fictitious hero deſcribe thoſe follies, foibles and paſſions, which they who really feel them, are not ſo forward to confeſs.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Locke in his <hi>Eſſay on the Human Underſtanding</hi> deſcribes all pity as partaking of contempt, I cannot acknowledge that he is ſpeaking of pity, as I feel it: when I pity a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creature in pain (a woman, for inſtance, in the throes of childbirth) I cannot ſubmit to own there is any ingredient of ſo bad a quality as contempt in my pity: but if the metaphyſicians tell me that I do not know how to call my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by their right name, and that my pity is not pity properly ſo defined, I will not pretend to diſpute with any gentleman, whoſe language I do not underſtand, and only beg permiſſion to enjoy a ſenſation, which I call pity, without indulging a propenſity, which he calls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>The flatterer is a character, which the mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and wits of all times and all nations have
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0600700105:60"/>
ridiculed more ſeverely and more ſucceſsfully than almoſt any other; yet it ſtill exiſts, and a few pages perhaps would not be miſapplied, if I was to make room for a civil kind of gentleman of this deſcription, (by name <hi>Billy Simper</hi>) who, having ſeen his failings in their proper light of ridicule, is willing to expoſe them to public view for the amuſement it is hoped, if not for the uſe and benefit, of the reader.</p>
            <p>I beg leave therefore to introduce Mr. <hi>Billy Simper</hi> to my candid friends and protectors, and ſhall leave him to tell his ſtory in his own words.—</p>
            <p>I am the younger ſon of a younger brother: my father qualified himſelf for orders in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Aberdeen, and by the help of an inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing addreſs, a ſoft counter-tenor voice, a civil ſmile and a happy flexibility in the vertebrae of his back-bone, recommended himſelf to the good graces of a right reverend patron, who after a due courſe of attendance and dependance preſented him to a comfortable benefice, which enabled him to ſupport a pretty numerous family of children. The good biſhop it ſeems was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately fond of the game of cheſs, and my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though the better player of the two, knew how to make a timely move ſo as to throw the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0600700105:61"/>
victory into his lordſhip's hands after a hard battle, which was a triumph very grateful to his vanity, and not a little ſerviceable to my father's purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Under this expert profeſſor I was inſtructed in all the ſhifts and movements in the great game of life, and then ſent to make my way in the world as well as I was able. My firſt object was to pay my court to my father's elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the head of our family; an enterprize not leſs arduous than important. My uncle Antony was a widower, parſimonious, peeviſh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe; he was rich however, egregiouſly ſelf-conceited, and in his own opinion a deep philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher and metaphyſician; by which I would be underſtood to ſay that he doubted every thing, diſputed every thing and believed nothing. He had one ſon, his only child, and him he had lately driven out of doors and diſinherited for nonſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in an argument upon the immortality of the ſoul: here then was an opening no prudent man could miſs, who ſcorned to ſay his ſoul was his own, when it ſtood in the way of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: and as I was well tutored beforehand, I no ſooner gained admiſſion to the old philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, than I ſo far worked my way into his good graces, as to be allowed to take poſſeſſion of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0600700105:62"/>
a truckle-bed in a ſpare garret of the family manſion: envy muſt have owned (if envy could have looked aſquint upon ſo humble a ſituation as mine was) that, conſidering what a game I had to play, I managed my cards well; for uncle Antony was an old dog at a diſpute, and as that cannot well take place, whilſt both parties are on the ſame ſide, I was forced at times to make battle for the good of the argument, and ſeldom failed to find Antony as compleatly puzzled with the zig-zaggeries of his metaphyſics, as uncle <hi>Toby</hi> of more worthy memory was with the horn-works and counterſcarps of his fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the various topics, from which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony's ingenuity drew matter of diſpute ſome were ſo truly ridiculous, that if I were ſure my reader was as much at leiſure to hear, as I am juſt now to relate them, I ſhould not ſcruple the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital. One morning having been rather long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded in deſcribing the circumſtances of a dream, that had diſturbed his imagination in the night, I thought it not amiſs to throw in a remark in the way of conſolation upon the fallacy of dreams in general. This was enough for him to turn over to the other ſide and ſupport the credit of dreams <hi>totis viribus:</hi> I now thought it adviſeable to trim, and took a middle courſe between both extremes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0600700105:63"/>
by humbly conceiving dreams might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times true and ſometimes falſe: this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be nonſenſe upon the face of it, and if I would undertake to ſhew they were both true and falſe, he would engage to prove by ſound logic they could be neither one nor the other:—<q rend="inline">"But why do we begin to talk,"</q> added he,
<q rend="inline">"before we ſettle what we are to talk about? What kind of dreams are you ſpeaking of, and how do you diſtinguiſh dreams?"—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"I ſee no diſtinction between them,"</q>
I replied;
<q rend="inline">"Dreams viſit our fancies in ſleep, and are all, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. Locke's idea, made up of the wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man's thoughts."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Does Mr. Locke ſay that?"</q>
exclaimed my uncle.
<q rend="inline">"Then Mr. Locke's an impoſtor for telling you ſo, and you are a fool for believing him: wiſer men than Mr. Locke have ſettled that matter many centuries before he was born or even <hi>dreamt</hi> of; but perhaps Mr. Locke forgot to tell you how many preciſe ſorts of dreams there are, and how to denominate and define them; perhaps he forgot that I ſay."</q>
I confeſſed that I neither knew any thing of the matter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor did I believe the author alluded to had left any clue towards the diſcovery.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I thought as much,"</q> retorted my uncle Antony in a tone of triumph,

the man who ſets up for an inveſtigator of the human underſtanding; but I will tell you, Sir, though he could not, that there are neither more nor leſs than five ſeveral ſorts of dreams particularly diſtinguiſhed, and I defy even the ſeven ſleepers themſelves to name a ſixth. The firſt of theſe was by the Greeks denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Oneiros,</hi> by the Latins <hi>Somnium,</hi> (ſimply a <hi>Dream</hi>) and you muſt be aſleep to dream it."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Granted,"</q> quoth I. <q rend="inline">"What is granted?"</q> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined the philoſopher,
<q rend="inline">"Not that ſleep is in all caſes indiſpenſable to the man who dreams."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Humph!"</q> quoth I.—My uncle proceeded.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The ſecond ſort of dreams you ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand was by the aforeſaid Greeks called <hi>Orama,</hi> by the Latins <hi>Viſio,</hi> or as we might ſay a <hi>viſion</hi>; in this caſe take notice you may be aſleep, or you may be awake, or neither, or as it were between both; your eyes may be ſhut, or they may be open, looking inwards or outwards or upwards, either with ſight or without ſight, as it pleaſes God, but the <hi>viſion</hi> you muſt ſee, or how elſe can it rightly be called a viſion?"</q>
               <q rend="inline">"True,"</q> replied I,
<q rend="inline">"there is a ſect who are particularly favoured with this kind of viſions."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Prythee, don't interrupt me,"</q>
ſaid my uncle, and again went on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0600700105:65"/>
               <q rend="inline">"The third ſort of dreams to ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Greeks we ſhall call <hi>Chrematiſmos,</hi> according to the Latins we muſt denominate it <hi>Oraculum,</hi> (an <hi>oracle</hi>); now this differs from a <hi>viſion,</hi> in as much as it may happen to a man born blind as well as to Argus himſelf, for he has nothing for it but to liſten, underſtand and believe, and whatever it tells him ſhall come true, though it never entered into his head to preconceive one tittle of what is told him; and where is Mr. Locke and his wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts here?"—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"He is done for,"</q> I anſwered,
<q rend="inline">"there is no diſputing againſt an oracle."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The fourth ſort,"</q> reſumed he,
<q rend="inline">"is the <hi>Enup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the aforeſaid Greeks and anſwers to the Latin <hi>Inſomnium,</hi> which is in fact a dream and no dream, a kind of <hi>reſverie,</hi> when a man doſes between ſleeping and waking and builds caſtles (as we ſay) in the air upon the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings of his own fancy."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The fifth and laſt ſort of dreams is by Greeks and Latins mutually ſtiled <hi>Phantaſma,</hi> a word adopted into our own language by the greateſt poet, who ever wrote in it: now this <hi>phantaſma</hi> is a viſitation peculiar to the firſt mental abſence or ſlumber, when the man
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0600700105:66"/>
fancies himſelf yet waking, and in fact can ſcarce be called aſleep; at which time ſtrange images and appearances ſeem to float before him and terrify his imagination. Here then you have all the ſeveral denominations of dreams perfectly diſtinguiſhed and defined,"</q>
quoth the old ſophiſt, and throwing himſelf back in his chair with an air of triumph, waited for the applauſe, which I was not backward in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing upon this pedantic farrago of dogmatiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dullneſs.</p>
            <p>It will readily be believed that my uncle An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony did not fail to revive his favorite controverſy, which had produced ſuch fatal conſequences to his diſcarded ſon: in fact he held faſt with thoſe antient philoſophers, who maintained the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this material world, and as he ſaw no period when men would not be in exiſtence, no moment in time to come when mortality ſhall ceaſe, he by conſequence argued that there could be no moment in time, when immortality ſhall commence. There were other points re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting this grand ſtumbling-block of his phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, the human ſoul, upon which he was equally puzzled, for he ſided with Ariſtotle againſt Plato in the unintelligible controverſy concerning its power of motion: but whilſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0600700105:67"/>
my uncle Antony was thus unluckily wedded to the wrong ſide in all caſes, where reaſon ought to have been his guide, in points of mere quibble and ſophiſtry, which reaſon has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay to, and where a wiſe man would take neither ſide, he regularly took both, or hung ſuſpended between them like Socrates in the baſket.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort was the celebrated queſtion—<hi>Ovumne prius fuerit, an gallina</hi>—viz: <q rend="inline">"Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the egg was anterior to the hen, or the hen to the egg."</q>—This enquiry never failed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt his paſſions in a peculiar degree, and he found ſo much to ſay on both ſides, that he could never well determine which ſide to be of: at length however, hoping to bring it to ſome point, he took up the cauſe of Egg verſus Hen, and having compoſed a learned eſſay, publiſhed it in one of the monthly magazines, as a lure to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture controverſialiſts. This eſſay he had ſo often avowed in my hearing, and piqued himſelf ſo highly upon it, that I muſt have been dull indeed not to have underſtood how to flatter him upon it: but when he had found month after month ſlip away, and nobody mounting the ſtage upon his challenge, he felt angry at the contempt, with which his labours were paſſed over, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0600700105:68"/>
without imparting to me his purpoſe, furniſhed the ſame magazine with a counter-eſſay, in which his former argument was handled with an aſperity truly controverſial, and the hen was triumphantly made to cackle over the new-laid egg, decidedly poſterior to herſelf.</p>
            <p>I am inclined to think that if Antony had any partiality, it was not to this ſide; but as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond eſſay was clearly poſterior to the firſt, (whatever the egg may have been to the hen) it had the advantage of being couched in all the ſpirit of a reply with an agreeable tinge of the malice of one, ſo that when at length it came down printed in a fair type, and reſpectfully poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the front of the long-wiſht-for magazine, his heart beat with joy, and calling out to me in a lofty tone of counterfeited anger, as he run his eye over it—<q rend="inline">"By the horns of Jupiter Ammon,"</q>
quoth he,
<q rend="inline">"here is a fellow has the confidence to enter the liſts againſt me in the notable queſtion of the egg."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Then I hope you will break that egg about his ears,"</q>
replied I.—<q rend="inline">"Hold your tongue, puppy, and liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,"</q>
quoth the ſophiſt and immediately began to read.</p>
            <p>At every pauſe I was ready with a pooh! or a piſh! which I hooked in with every mark of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0600700105:69"/>
contempt I could give it both by accent and action. At the concluſion of the eſſay my uncle Antony ſhut the book and demanded what I thought of the author—<q rend="inline">"Hang him,"</q> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
<q rend="inline">"poor, Grub-ſtreet Garreteer; the fellow is too contemptible for your notice; he can neither write, nor reaſon; he is a mere ignoramus, and does not know the commoneſt rules of logic: he has no feature of a critic about him, but the malice of one."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Hold your tongue,"</q>
cried Antony, no longer able to contain himſelf,
<q rend="inline">"you are a booby; I will maintain it to be as fine an eſſay as ever was written."</q>—With theſe words he ſnatched up the magazine and departed: I ſaw no more of him that night, and early next morning was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by a ſervant with the following billet—<q rend="inline">"The Grub-ſtreet Garreteer finds himſelf no longer fit company for the ſagacious <hi>Mr. William Simper</hi>; therefore deſires him without loſs of time to ſeek out better ſociety than that of a <hi>mere ignoramus, who does not know the common rules of logic:</hi> one rule however he makes bold to lay down, which is, Never again to ſee the face of an impertinent upſtart, called William Simper, whilſt he remains on this earth."</q>

            <p>DRIVEN from my uncle Antony's doors by my unlucky miſtake between the hen and her egg, my caſe would have been deſperate, but that I had yet one ſtring left to my bow, and this was my aunt <hi>Mrs. Suſanna Simper,</hi> who lived within a few miles of my uncle, but in ſuch declared hoſtility, that I promiſed myſelf a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable reception, if I could but flatter her ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity with a ſufficient portion of invective; and for this I deemed myſelf very tolerably qualified, having ſo much good-will towards the buſineſs, and no ſlight inducements to ſpur me to it.</p>
            <p>My aunt, who was an aged maiden, and a valetudinarian, was at my arrival cloſeted with her apothecary: upon his departure I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my audience, in which I acquitted myſelf with all the addreſs I was maſter of: my aunt heard my ſtory through without interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me by a ſingle word; at laſt, fixing her eyes upon me, ſhe ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"'Tis very well, child; you
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0600700105:71"/>
have ſaid enough; your uncle's character I perfectly underſtand; look well to your own, for upon that will depend the terms you and I ſhall be upon."</q>—She now took up a phial from the table and ſurveying it for ſome time, ſaid to me—<q rend="inline">"Here is a noſtrum recommended by my apothecary, that promiſes great things, but perhaps contains none of the wondrous properties it profeſſes to have: the label ſays it is a carminative, ſedative mixture; in other words, it will expel vapours and ſpaſms, and quiet the mind and ſpirits: Do you think it will make good what it promiſes?"</q>—So whimſical a queſtion put to me at ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confounded me not a little, and I only murmured out in reply, that I hoped it would—<q rend="inline">"Take it then,"</q> ſaid my aunt,
<q rend="inline">"as you have faith in it; ſwallow it yourſelf, and when I ſee how it operates with you, I may have more confidence in it on my own account."</q>—I was now in a more awkward dilemma than ever, for ſhe had emptied the doſe into a cup, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it to me in ſo peremptory a manner, that, not knowing how to excuſe myſelf, and being naturally ſubmiſſive, I ſilently took the cup with a trembling hand, and ſwallowed its abominable contents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0600700105:72"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Much good may it do you, child,"</q> cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"you have done more for me than I would for any doctor in the kingdom: Don't you find it nauſeous to the palate?"</q>—I confeſt that it was very nauſeous.—<q rend="inline">"And did you think yourſelf in need of ſuch a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine?"—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"I did not perceive that I was."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Then you did not ſwallow it by your own choice, but my deſire?"</q>—I had no heſitation in acknowledging that.—<q rend="inline">"Upon my word, child,"</q>
ſhe replied,
<q rend="inline">"you have a very accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating way with you."</q>
I was now fighting with the curſed drug, and had all the difficulty in life to keep it where it was. My aunt ſaw my diſtreſs, and ſmiling at it demanded if I was not ſick: I confeſt I was rather diſcompoſed in my ſtomach with the draught.—<q rend="inline">"I don't doubt it,"</q> ſhe replied;
<q rend="inline">"but as you have ſo civilly made yourſelf ſick for my ſake, cannot you flatter me ſo far as to be well, when I requeſt it?"</q>
I was juſt then ſtruggling to keep the nauſea down, and though I could not anſwer, put the beſt face upon the matter in my power.</p>
            <p>A maid-ſervant came in upon my aunt's ringing her bell.—<q rend="inline">"Betty,"</q> ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"take away theſe things; this doctor will poiſon us with his doſes."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Foh!"</q> cried the wench,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0600700105:73"/>
               <q rend="inline">"how it ſmells!"</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Nay, but only put your lips to the cup,"</q>
ſaid the miſtreſs,
<q rend="inline">"there is enough left for you to taſte it."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"I taſte it! I'll not touch it, I want none of his naſty phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, but though you don't want it,"</q> rejoined the miſtreſs,
<q rend="inline">"taſte it nevertheleſs, if it be only to flatter my humour."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Excuſe me, madam,"</q>
replied Betty,
<q rend="inline">"I'll not make myſelf ſick to flatter any body."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Humph!"</q> cried my aunt,
<q rend="inline">"how this wench's want of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners muſt have ſhocked you, nephew William! you ſwallowed the whole doſe at a word, ſhe, though my ſervant, at my repeated command would not touch it with her lips; but theſe low-bred creatures have a will of their own."</q>—There was ſomething in my aunt's manner I did not underſtand; ſhe puzzled me, and I thought it beſt to keep myſelf on the reſerve, and wait the further developement of her humour in ſilence.</p>
            <p>We went down to ſupper; it was elegantly ſerved, and my aunt particularly recommended two or three diſhes to me; her hoſpitality em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed me not a little, for my ſtomach was by no means reconciled; yet I felt myſelf bound in good manners to eat of her diſhes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their cookery; this I did, though ſorely
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0600700105:74"/>
againſt the grain, and, whilſt my ſtomach roſe againſt its food, I flattered what I nauſeated.</p>
            <p>A grave, well-looking perſonage ſtood at the ſideboard, with whom my aunt entered into converſation.—<q rend="inline">"Johnſon,"</q> ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"I think I muſt lodge my nephew in your room, which is warm and well-aired, and diſpoſe of you in the tapeſtry chamber, which has not lately been ſlept in."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Madam,"</q> replied Johnſon,
<q rend="inline">"I am ready to give up my bed to Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam at your command; but as to ſleeping in the tapeſtry chamber you muſt excuſe me."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Why?"</q> replied my aunt,
<q rend="inline">"what is your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection?"</q>
               <q rend="inline">"I am almoſt aſhamed to tell you,"</q>
anſwered Johnſon,
<q rend="inline">"but every body has his humour; perhaps my objection may be none to the young gentleman, but I confeſs I don't chuſe to paſs the night in a chamber, that is under an ill name."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"An ill name for what?"</q>
demanded the lady.
<q rend="inline">"For being haunted,"</q>
anſwered the butler,
<q rend="inline">"for being viſited by noiſes, and rattling of chains and apparitions; the gentleman no doubt is a ſcholar and can account for theſe things; I am a plain man, and don't like to have my imagination diſturbed, nor my reſt broken, though it were only by my own fancies."</q>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0600700105:75"/>
               <q rend="inline">"What then is to be done?"</q> ſaid my aunt, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting her queſtion to me;
<q rend="inline">"Johnſon don't chuſe to truſt himſelf in a haunted chamber; I ſhall have my houſe brought into diſcredit by theſe reports: Now, nephew, if you will encounter this ghoſt, and exorciſe the chamber by ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it a few nights, I dare ſay we ſhall hear no more of it. Are you willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>I was aſhamed to confeſs my fears, and yet had no ſtomach to the undertaking; I was alſo afraid of giving umbrage to my aunt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing her with an unfavourable opinion of me; I therefore aſſented upon the condition of John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's taking part of the bed with me; upon which the old lady, turning to her butler, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Well, Johnſon, you have no objection to this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Pardon me, madam,"</q> ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">"I have ſuch objections to that chamber, that I will not ſleep in it for any body living."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"You ſee he is obſtinate,"</q>
ſaid my aunt,
<q rend="inline">"you muſt even undertake it alone, or my houſe will lie under an ill name for ever."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Sooner than this ſhall be the caſe,"</q>
I replied,
<q rend="inline">"I will ſleep in the chamber by myſelf."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"You are very polite,"</q>
cried my aunt,
<q rend="inline">"and I admire your ſpirit: Johnſon, light my nephew to his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0600700105:76"/>
room."</q>
Johnſon took up the candle, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely refuſed to march before me with the light, when we came into the gallery, where, pointing to a door, he told me that was my chamber, and haſtily made his retreat down the ſtairs.</p>
            <p>I opened the door with no ſmall degree of terror and found a chamber comfortably and elegantly furniſhed, and by no means of that melancholy caſt, which I had pictured to myſelf from Johnſon's report of it. My firſt precaution was to ſearch the cloſet; I then peeped under the bed, examined the hangings; all was as it ſhould be; nothing ſeemed to augur a ghoſt, or (which I take to be worſe) the counterfeit of a ghoſt. I plucked up as good a ſpirit as I could, ſaid my prayers and turned into bed: With the darkneſs my terrors returned; I paſſed a ſleepleſs night, though neither ghoſt, nor noiſe of any ſort moleſted me.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why,"</q> ſaid I within myſelf,
<q rend="inline">"could not I be as ſincere and peremptory as Johnſon? He takes his reſt and is at peace, I am ſleepleſs and in terrors: Though a ſervant by condition, in his will he is independant; I, who have not the like call of duty, have not the ſame liberty of mind: he refuſes what he does not chuſe to obey, I obey all things whether I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0600700105:77"/>
chuſe them or not; And wherefore do I this? Becauſe I am a flatterer: And why did I ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a whole nauſeous doſe to humour my aunt's caprice, which her own chamber-maid, who receives her wages, would not touch with her lips? Becauſe I am a flatterer: And what has this flattery done for me, who am a ſlave to it? what did I gain by it at my uncle's? I was the echo of his opinions, ſhifted as they ſhifted, ſided with him againſt truth, demonſtration, reaſon and even the evidence of my own ſenſes: Abject wretch, I ſunk myſelf in my own eſteem firſt, then loſt all ſhadow of reſpect with him, and was finally expelled from his doors, whilſt I was in the very act of proſtituting my own judgment to his groſs abſurdities: And now again, here I am at my aunt's, devoted to the ſame mean flattery, that has already ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully betrayed me. What has flattery gained for me here? A bitter harveſt truly I have had of it; poiſoned by an infernal doſe, which I had no plea for ſwallowing; ſurfeited by dainties I had no appetite to taſte, and now condemned to ſleepleſs hours within a haunted chamber, which her own domeſtic would not conſent even to enter: Fool that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0600700105:78"/>
I am to be the dupe of ſuch a vapor as flattery! deſpicable wretch, not to aſſert a freedom of will, which is the natural right of every man, and which even ſervants and hirelings exerciſe with a ſpirit I envy, but have not the heart to imitate: I am aſhamed of my own meanneſs; I bluſh for myſelf in the compariſon, and am determined, if I ſurvive till to-morrow, to aſſert the dignity of a man, and abide by the conſequences."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In meditations like theſe night paſſed away, and the dawn of morning called me from my bed: I roſe and refreſhed my ſpirits with a walk through a moſt charming plantation: I met a countryman at his work—<q rend="inline">"Friend,"</q> ſaid I, <q rend="inline">"you are early at your labour."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Yes,"</q> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he,
<q rend="inline">"'tis by my labour I live, and whilſt I have health and ſtrength to follow it, I have nothing to fear but God alone."</q>
So! thought I, here is a leſſon for me; this man is no flatterer; then why do I worſhip what a clown deſpiſes?</p>
            <p>I found my aunt ready for breakfaſt; ſhe queſtioned me about my night's reſt; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her with truth that I had enjoyed no reſt, but had neither ſeen nor heard any thing to alarm me, and was perſuaded there were no
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0600700105:79"/>
grounds for the report of her chamber being haunted.
<q rend="inline">"I am as well perſuaded as yourſelf of that,"</q>
ſhe replied;
<q rend="inline">"I know 'tis only one of Johnſon's whims; but people you know will have their whims, and it was great courteſy in you to ſacrifice a night's reſt to his humour: my ſervants have been ſpoilt by indulgence, but it is to be hoped they will learn better ſubmiſſion by your example."</q>
There was a ſarcaſtic tone in my aunt's manner of uttering this, which gave it more the air of ridicule than compliment, and I bluſht to the eyes with the conſciouſneſs of deſerving it.</p>
            <p>After breakfaſt ſhe took me into her cloſet, and, deſiring me to ſit down to a writing table, <q rend="inline">"Nephew,"</q> ſays ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"I know my brother Antony full well; he is a tyrant in his nature, a bigot to his opinions, and a man of a moſt perverted underſtanding, but he is rich and you have your fortune to make; he can inſult, but you can flatter; he has his weakneſſes, and you can avail yourſelf of them; ſuppoſe you write him a penitential letter."</q>—I now ſaw the opportunity preſent for exerting my new-made reſolution, and felt a ſpirit riſing within me, that prompted me to deliver myſelf as follows.
<q rend="inline">"No, madam, I will neither gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0600700105:80"/>
my uncle's pride, nor lower my own ſelf-eſteem, by making him any ſubmiſſion; I deſpiſe him for the inſults he has put upon me, and myſelf for having in ſome ſort deſerved them; but I will never flatter him or any living creature more; and if I am to forfeit your favour by reſiſting your commands, I muſt meet the conſequences, and will rather truſt to my own labour for ſupport than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the caprice of any perſon living; leaſt of all on him."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Heyday,"</q> cried my aunt,
<q rend="inline">"you refuſe to write!—you will not do as I adviſe you?"</q>
               <q rend="inline">"In this particular,"</q> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,

            <p>THE celebrated author of the <hi>Rambler</hi> in his concluding paper ſays, <hi>I have laboured to refine our language to grammatical purity, and</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0600700105:82"/>
               <hi>to clear it from colloquial barbariſms, licentious idioms and irregular combinations: ſomething per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I have added to the elegance of its conſtruction, and ſomething to the harmony of its cadence.</hi> I hope our language hath gained all the profit, which the labours of this meritorious writer were exerted to produce: in ſtile of a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription he undoubtedly excels; but though I think there is much in his eſſays for a reader to admire, I ſhould not recommend them as a model for a diſciple to copy.</p>
            <p>Simplicity, eaſe and perſpicuity ſhould be the firſt objects of a young writer: Addiſon and other authors of his claſs will furniſh him with examples, and aſſiſt him in the attainment of theſe excellencies; but after all, the ſtile, in which a man ſhall write, will not be formed by imitation only; it will be the ſtile of his mind; it will aſſimilate itſelf to his mode of thinking, and take its colour from the complexion of his ordinary diſcourſe, and the company he conſorts with. As for that diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic, which the ingenious eſſayiſt terms very properly <hi>the harmony of its cadence</hi>; that I take to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable and immediately dependant upon the ear of him, who models it. This <hi>harmony of cadence</hi> is ſo ſtrong a mark of diſcrimination
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0600700105:83"/>
between authors of note in the world of letters, that we can depoſe to a ſtile, whoſe modulation we are familiar with, almoſt as confidently as to the hand-writing of a correſpondent. But though I think there will be found in the periods of every eſtabliſhed writer a certain peculiar tune, (whether harmonious or otherwiſe) which will depend rather upon the natural ear than upon the imitative powers, yet I would not be underſtood to ſay that the ſtudy of good models can fail to be of uſe in the firſt formation of it. When a ſubject preſents itſelf to the mind, and thoughts ariſe, which are to be committed to writing, it is then for a man to chuſe whether he will expreſs himſelf in ſimple or in elaborate diction, whether he will compreſs his matter or dilate it, ornament it with epithets and robe it in metaphor, or whether he will deliver it plainly and naturally in ſuch language as a well-bred perſon and a ſcholar would uſe, who affects no parade of ſpeech, nor aims at any flights of fancy. Let him decide as he will, in all theſe caſes he hath models in plenty to chuſe from, which may be ſaid to court his imitation.</p>
            <p>For inſtance; if his ambition is to glitter and ſurprize with the figurative and metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal brilliancy of his period, let him tune his ear
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0600700105:84"/>
to ſome ſuch paſſages as the following, where <hi>Doctor Johnſon</hi> in the character of critic and biographer is pronouncing upon the poet <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve.</hi>
               <q rend="inline">"His ſcenes exhibit not much of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, imagery or paſſion: his perſonages are a kind of intellectual gladiators; every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is to ward or ſtrike, the conteſt of ſmartneſs is never intermitted; his wit is a meteor playing to and fro with alternate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſcations."</q>
If he can learn to embroider with as much ſpendor, taſte and addreſs as this and many other ſamples from the ſame maſter exhibit, he cannot ſtudy in a better ſchool.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, if ſimplicity be his object, and a certain ſerenity of ſtile, which ſeems in uniſon with the ſoul, he may open the <hi>Spectator,</hi> and take from the firſt paper of Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> the firſt paragraph, that meets his eye—the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for inſtance—<q rend="inline">"There is nothing that makes its way more directly to the ſoul than <hi>Beauty,</hi> which immediately diffuſes a ſecret ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and complacency through the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gives a finiſhing to any thing that is great or uncommon: the very firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it ſtrikes the mind with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy, and ſpreads a chearfulneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light through all its faculties."</q>
Or again
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0600700105:85"/>
in the ſame eſſay.
<q rend="inline">"We no where meet with a more glorious or pleaſing ſhow in nature than what appears in the heavens at the riſing and ſetting of the ſun, which is wholly made up of thoſe different ſtains of light, that ſhow themſelves in clouds of a different ſituation."</q>
A florid writer would hardly have reſiſted the opportunities, which here court the imagination to indulge its flights, whereas few writers of any ſort would have been tempted on a topic merely critical to have employed ſuch figurative and ſpendid diction, as that of Doctor Johnſon; theſe little ſamples therefore, though ſelected with little or no care, but taken as they came to hand, may ſerve to exemplify my meaning, and in ſome degree characterize the different ſtiles of the reſpective writers.</p>
            <p>Now as every ſtudent, who is capable of copying either of theſe ſtiles, or even of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them, muſt diſcern on which ſide the greater danger of miſcarrying lies, as well as the greater diſgrace in caſe of ſuch miſcarriage, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will direct him in his outſet not to hazard the attempt at a florid diction. If his ear hath not been vitiated by vulgar habitudes, he will only have to guard againſt mean expreſſions, whilſt he is ſtudying to be ſimple and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0600700105:86"/>
he will put his thoughts into language naturally as they preſent themſelves, giving them for the preſent little more than mere grammatical correction; afterwards, upon a cloſer review, he will poliſh thoſe parts that ſeem rude, harmonize them where they are unequal, compreſs what is too diffuſive, raiſe what is low, and attune the whole to that general cadence, which ſeems moſt grateful to his ear.</p>
            <p>But if our ſtudent hath been ſmitten with the turbulent oratory of the ſenate, the acrimonious declamation of the bar, or the pompous elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the pulpit, and ſhall take the lofty ſpeakers in theſe ſeveral orders for his models, rather than ſuch as addreſs the ear in humbler tones, his paſſions will in that caſe hurry him into the florid and figurative ſtile, to a ſublime and ſwelling period; and if in this he excels, it muſt be owned he accompliſhes a great and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous taſk, and he will gain a liberal ſhare of applauſe from the world, which in general is apt to be captivated with thoſe high and towering images, that ſtrike and ſurprize the ſenſes. In this ſtile the Hebrew prophets write,
<q rend="inline">"whoſe diſcourſe"</q>
(to uſe the words of the learned <hi>Doctor Bentley</hi>)
<q rend="inline">"after the genius of the Eaſtern nations, is thick ſet-with metaphor and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0600700105:87"/>
the ſame bold compariſons and dithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rambic liberty of ſtile every where occurring—For when <hi>the Spirit of God came upon them,</hi> and breathed a new warmth and vigour through all the powers of the body and ſoul; when by the influx of divine light the whole ſcene of Chriſt's heavenly kingdom was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to their view, ſo that their hearts were raviſhed with joy, and their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions turgid and pregnant with the glorious ideas; then ſurely, if ever, their ſtile would be ſtrong and lofty, full of alluſions to all that is great and magnificent in the kingdoms of this world." <bibl>(Commencement Sermon.)</bibl>
               </q>—And theſe flights of imagination, theſe effuſions of rapture and ſublimity will occaſionally be found in the pulpit eloquence of ſome of our moſt correct and temperate writers; witneſs that brilliant apoſtrophe at the concluſion of the ninth diſcourſe of <hi>Biſhop Sherlock,</hi> than whom few or none have written with more didactic brevity and ſimplicity—<q rend="inline">"Go,"</q> (ſays he to the Deiſts)
<q rend="inline">"go to your natural religion: Lay before her Mahomet and his diſciples arrayed in armour and in blood, riding in triumph over the ſpoils of thouſands and tens of thouſands, who fell by his victorious ſword: Shew her the cities,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0600700105:88"/>
which he ſet in flames, the countries which he ravaged and deſtroyed, and the miſerable diſtreſs of all the inhabitants of the earth When ſhe has viewed him in this ſcene, carry her into his retirements; ſhew her the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's chamber, his concubines and wives; let her ſee his adultery, and hear him alledge revelation and his divine commiſſion to juſtify his luſt and oppreſſion. When ſhe is tired with this proſpect, then ſhew her the bleſſed Jeſus, humble and meek, doing good to all the ſons of men, patiently inſtructing both the ignorant and perverſe; let her ſee him in his moſt retired privacies; let her follow him to the mount, and hear his devotions and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to God; carry her to his table to view his poor fare, and hear his heavenly diſcourſe: Let her ſee him injured but not provoked; let her attend him to the tribunal, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the patience with which he endured the ſcoffs and reproaches of his enemies: Lead her to his croſs, and let her view him in the agony of death, and hear his laſt prayer for his perſecutors—<hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a lofty paſſage in the high imperative tone of declamation; it is richly coloured, boldly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0600700105:89"/>
contraſted and replete with imagery, and is amongſt the ſtrongeſt of thoſe inſtances, where the orator addreſſes himſelf to the ſenſes and paſſions of his hearers: But let the diſciple tread this path with caution; let him wait the call, and be ſure he has an occaſion worthy of his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts before he makes them.</p>
            <p>Allegory, perſonification and metaphor will preſs upon his imagination at certain times, but let him ſoberly conſult his judgment in thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and weigh their fitneſs before he admits them into his ſtile. As for allegory, it is at beſt but a kind of fairy form; it is hard to natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize it and it will rarely fill a graceful part in any manly compoſition. With reſpect to perſonifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as I am ſpeaking of proſe only, it is but an exotic ornament, and may be conſidered ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the loan of the muſes than as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of proſe; let our ſtudent therefore beware how he borrows the feathers of the jay, leſt his unnatural finery ſhould only ſerve to make him pointed at and deſpiſed. Metaphor, on the other hand, is common property, and he may take his ſhare of it, provided he has diſcretion not to abuſe his privilege, and neither ſurfeits the appetite with repletion, nor confounds the palate with too much variety: Let his metaphor be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0600700105:90"/>
appoſite, ſingle and unconfuſed, and it will ſerve him as a kind of rhetorical lever to lift and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his ſtile above the pitch of ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; let him alſo ſo apply this machine, as to make it touch in as many points as poſſible; otherwiſe it can never ſo poiſe the weight above it, as to keep it firm and ſteady on its proper center.</p>
            <p>To give an example of the right uſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this figure I again apply to a learned author already quoted—<q rend="inline">"Our firſt parents hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen from their native ſtate of innocence, the tincture of evil, like an hereditary diſeaſe infected all their poſterity; and the leaven of ſin having once corrupted the whole maſs of mankind, all the ſpecies ever after would be ſoured and tainted with it; the vitious fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perpetually diffuſing and propagating itſelf through all generations."—<bibl>(Bentley, Comm. Sermon).</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There will be found alſo in certain writers a profuſion of words, ramifying indeed from the ſame root, yet riſing into climax by their power and importance, which ſeems to burſt forth from the overflow and impetuoſity of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; reſembling at firſt ſight what <hi>Quintilian</hi> characteriſes as the <hi>Abundantia Juvenilis,</hi> but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0600700105:91"/>
which, when tempered by the hand of a maſter, will upon cloſer examination be found to bear the ſtamp of judgment under the appearance of precipitancy. I need only turn to the famous <hi>Commencement Sermon</hi> before quoted, and my meaning will be fully illuſtrated—<q rend="inline">"Let them tell us then what is the chain, the cement, the magnetiſm, what they will call it, the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tie of that union, whereby matter and an incorporeal mind, things that have no ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or alliance to each other, can ſo ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize by a mutual league of motion and ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No; they will not pretend to that, for they can frame no conceptions of it: They are ſure there is ſuch an union from the operations and effects, but the cauſe and the manner of it are too ſubtle and ſecret to be diſcovered by the eye of reaſon; 'tis myſtery, 'tis divine magic, 'tis natural miracle."</q>

                  <p>I HAVE a habit of dealing in the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, which I cannot overcome: Some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſeem to take a pleaſure in magnifying the little flaws to be found in all characters, call this by a name, which no gentleman ought to uſe, or likes to hear: The fact is, I have ſo much tender conſideration for Truth in her ſtate of nakedneſs, that, till I have put her into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent cloathing, I cannot think of bringing her into company; and if her appearance is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo much altered by dreſs, that her beſt friends cannot find her out, am I to blame for that?</p>
                  <p>There is a matter-of-fact man of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who haunts me in all places and is the very torment of my life; he ſticks to me as the threſher does to the whale, and is the perfect
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0600700105:93"/>
night-mare of my imagination; this fellow never lets one of my ſtories paſs without dock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it like an attorney's bill before a maſter in chancery: He cut forty miles out of a journey of one hundred, which but for him I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in one day upon the ſame horſe; in which I confeſs I had ſtretched a point for the pleaſure of out-riding a fat fellow in company, who by the malicious veracity of my aforeſaid <hi>Damper</hi> threw me at leaſt ten miles diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him.</p>
                  <p>This provoking animal cut up my ſucceſs in ſo many intrigues and adventures, that I was determined to lay my plan out of his reach in a ſpot, which I had provided for an evil day, and accordingly I led him a dance into Corſica, where I was ſure he could not follow me: Here I had certainly been, and knew my ground well enough to prance over it at a very handſome rate: I noticed a kind of ſly leer in ſome of the company, which was pointed towards a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man preſent, who was a ſtranger to me, and ſo far from joining in the titter was very politely attentive to what I was relating. I was at this moment warm in the cauſe of freedom, and had performed ſuch prodigies of valour in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that before my ſtory was well ended I had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0600700105:94"/>
got upon ſuch cloſe terms with General Paoli, that, had my hearers been but half as credulous as they ought to have been, they might have ſet us down for ſworn friends and inſeparables: But here again, as ill luck would have it, my evil genius tapt me on the ſhoulder, and remarking that I principally addreſſed myſelf to the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe politeneſs and attention were ſo flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, ſaid to me with a ſmile, that had the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the devil in it—<q rend="inline">"Give me leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce you to General Paoli here preſent."</q>—Death and confuſion, what I felt! a ſtroke of lightning would have been charity compared to this.—My perſecutor had not done with me—<q rend="inline">I
"am afraid you have forgot your old friend and familiar, who no doubt will be overjoyed at recognizing a brother warrior, who has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſuch noble ſervices jointly with himſelf in the glorious ſtruggle for the liberties of his beloved country."</q>—Can I paint the ſhame I ſuffered at this moment? It is impoſſible; I can only ſay there is a generoſity in true valour, which ſcorns to triumph over the fallen.—<q rend="inline">"There were ſo many brave men,"</q> (ſaid that gallant perſon in a tone I ſhall never loſe the impreſſion of)

have ſlipt from my recollection, that I have only to entreat your pardon for a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, which I deſire you to believe is not my fault, but my infirmity."</q>—If a bottle had been vollied at my head, I could not have been more in need of a ſurgeon, than I was at this inſtant: I could never have ſuſpected Truth of playing me ſuch a jade's trick; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conſidered her as a good-natured ſimple creature without gall or bitterneſs, and was in the habit of treating her accordingly; but this was ſuch a ſpecimen of her malice, that I fled out of her company as haſtily as I could.</p>
                  <p>The very next morning I took my paſſage in the ſtage-coach for my native town in the north of England, heartily out of humour with my trip to Corſica; but even here I could not ſhake off old habits ſo far as to reſiſt the temptation of getting into a poſt-chaiſe for the laſt ſtage, by which manoeuvre I took the credit of having travelled like a gentleman, and became intitled to rail againſt the poſt-tax and the expences of the road.</p>
                  <p>I was now voted into a club of the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the place, and as I had no reaſon to believe the ſtory of my late diſcomfiture had reached them, I ſoon recovered my ſpirits, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0600700105:96"/>
with them the amplifying powers of my inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My ſtories for a conſiderable time were ſwallowed ſo glibly, and ſeemed to ſit ſo eaſy on the ſtomachs of theſe natural, unſophiſticated people, that I was encouraged to encreaſe the doſe to ſuch a degree, as ſeemed at length to produce ſomething like a nauſea with thoſe I adminiſtered it to; eſpecially with a certain preciſe perſonage of the ſect of Quakers, one <hi>Simon Stiff,</hi> a weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy trader and much reſpected for his probity and fair-dealing. <hi>Simon</hi> had a way of aſking me at the end of a ſtory—<hi>But is it true?</hi>—which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſconcerted me, and conſiderably leſſened the applauſes, that the reſt of the club had been accuſtomed to beſtow upon my narratives.</p>
                  <p>One evening, when I had been deſcribing an enormous ſhark, by which I had been attacked in one of my Weſt-India voyages, <hi>Simon Stiff,</hi> lifting up both his hands in an attitude of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, cried out—<q rend="inline">"Verily, friend <hi>Cracker,</hi> thou draweſt a long bow."</q>
With an angry look I demanded the meaning of that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—<q rend="inline">"I mean,"</q> replied <hi>Simon,</hi>
                     <q rend="inline">"thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the thing which is not."</q>
                     <q rend="inline">"That is as much as to ſay I tell a lie."—</q>
                     <q rend="inline">"Even ſo, friend, thou haſt hit it,"</q>
ſaid <hi>Simon</hi> without altering his voice, or regarding the tone of rage
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0600700105:97"/>
I had thrown mine into: The ſteady ſerenity of his countenance put me down, and I ſuffered him to proceed without interruption—<q rend="inline">"Thou haſt told us many things, friend <hi>Cracker,</hi> that are perfectly incredible; were I to attempt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon my cuſtomers in the way of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic, as thou doſt upon thy company in the way of talk, the world would juſtly ſet me down for a diſhoneſt man. Believe me, thou mayeſt be a very good companion without ſwerving from the truth, nay, thou canſt no otherwiſe be a good one than by adhering to it; for if thou art in the practice of uttering falſehoods, we ſhall be in the practice of diſbelieving thee, even when thou ſpeakeſt the truth, and ſo there will be an end of all confidence in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and thy word will paſs for nothing. I have obſerved it is thy vanity, that betrays thee into falſehood; I ſhould have hoped thou wou'dſt not have forgotten how thy falſehood betrayed thee into ſhame, and how we received and welcomed thee into our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, when thy friends in the metropolis had hooted thee out of their's. Think not thou canſt eſtabliſh a credit with us by the fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of imagination; plain truths ſuit men of plain underſtandings. Had thy ſhark been as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0600700105:98"/>
big again as thou wou'dſt have us believe it was, what wou'dſt thou have gained by it? Nothing but the merit of having ſeen a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and what is that compared to the riſque of being thought a monſter-maker? If thou waſt ſnatched from the jaws of the animal by the hand of God, give God the praiſe: If thine own courage and addreſs contributed to ſave thee, give Him ſtill the praiſe, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired thee with thoſe means of furthering his Providence in thy reſcue; Where is the ground for boaſting in all this? Sometimes thou wou'dſt perſuade us thou art a man of conſequence, in the favour of princes and in the ſecrets of miniſters: If we are to believe all this, thou doſt but libel thoſe miniſters for letting ſuch a babler into their councils, and if thou thinkeſt to gain a conſequence with us thereby, thou art grievouſly deceived, friend <hi>Cracker,</hi> for we do not want to know what thou oughteſt not to tell, and we deſpiſe the ſervant, who betrayeth his maſter's truſt. As for wonders, what ſignifieth telling us of them?

                  <p>I wait with impatience to hear of the ſucceſs of your tragedy, and in the mean time have worked off a frontiſpiece for it, that you, who have a paſſion for the terrific, will be perfectly charmed with.</p>
                  <p>I am ſcandalized when I hear people ſay that the fine arts are protected in this country; nothing can be further from the truth, as I am one amongſt many to witneſs. Painting I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume will not be diſputed to be one of the fine arts, and I may ſay without vanity I have ſome pretenſions to rank with the beſt of my brethren in that profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>My firſt ſtudies were carried on in the capital of a certain county, where I was born; and being determined to chuſe a ſtriking ſubject for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0600700105:106"/>
my <hi>debût</hi> in the branch of portrait-painting, I perſwaded my grandmother to ſit to me, and I am bold to ſay there was great merit in my pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſidering it as a maiden production; particularly in the execution of a hair-mole upon her chin, and a wart under her eye, which I touched to ſuch a nicety, as to make every body ſtart, who caſt their eyes upon the canvaſs.</p>
                  <p>There was a little dwarfiſh lad in the pariſh, who beſides the deformity of his perſon, had a remarkable hare-lip, which expoſed to view a broken row of diſcoloured teeth, and was indeed a very brilliant ſubject for a painter of effect: I gave a full-length of him, that was executed ſo to the life, as to turn the ſtomach of every body, who looked upon it.</p>
                  <p>At this time there came into our town a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling ſhow-man, who amongſt other curioſities of the ſavage kind brought with him a man-ape, or Ourong-outong; and this perſon, having ſeen and admired my portrait of the little hump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backed dwarf, employed me to take the figure of his celebrated ſavage for the purpoſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing it on the outſide of his booth. Such an occaſion of introducing my art into notice ſpurred my genius to extraordinary exertions, and though I muſt premiſe that the ſavage was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0600700105:107"/>
not the beſt ſitter in the world, yet I flatter myſelf I acquitted myſelf to the ſatisfaction of his keeper and did juſtice to the ferocity of my ſubject: I caught him in one of his moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing attitudes, ſtanding erect with a huge club in his paw: I put every muſcle into play, and threw ſuch a terrific dignity into his features, as would not have diſgraced the character of a <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Caligula.</hi> I was happy to obſerve the general notice, which was taken of my perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by all the country folks, who reſorted to the ſhow, and I believe my employer had no cauſe to repent of having ſet me upon the work.</p>
                  <p>The figure of this animal with the club in his paw ſuggeſted a hint to a publican in the place of treating his ale-houſe with a new ſign, and as he had been in the ſervice of a noble family, who from antient time have borne the <hi>Bear and ragged ſtaff</hi> for their ereſt, he gave me a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to provide him with a ſign to that effect: Though I ſpared no pains to get a real bear to ſit to me for his portrait, my endeavours proved abortive, and I was forced to reſort to ſuch common prints of that animal as I could obtain, and truſted to my imagination for ſupplying what elſe might be wanted for the piece: As I
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0600700105:108"/>
worked upon this capital deſign in the room, where my grandmother's portrait was before my eyes, it occurred to me to introduce the ſame hair-mole into the whiſkers of Bruin, which I had ſo ſucceſsfully copied from her chin, and certainly the thought was a happy one, for it had a pictureſque effect; but in doing this I was naturally enough, though undeſignedly, betrayed into giving ſuch a general reſemblance to the good dame in the reſt of Bruin's features, that when it came to be exhibited on the ſign-poſt all the people cried out upon the likeneſs, and a malicious rumour ran through the town, that I had painted my grandmother inſtead of the bear; which loſt me the favour of that indulgent relation, though Heaven knows I was as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the intention as the child unborn.</p>
                  <p>The diſguſt my grandmother conceived againſt her likeneſs with the ragged ſtaff, gave me incredible uneaſineſs, and as ſhe was a good cuſtomer to the landlord and much reſpected in the place, he was induced to return the bear upon my hands. I am now thinking to what uſe I can turn him, and as it occurs to me, that by throwing a little more authority into his features, and gilding his chain, he might very poſſibly hit the likeneſs of ſome lord mayor of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0600700105:109"/>
London in his fur-gown and gold chain, and make a reſpectable figure in ſome city hall, I am willing to diſpoſe of him to any ſuch at an eaſy price.</p>
                  <p>As I have alſo preſerved a ſketch of my famous Ourong-Outong, a thought has ſtruck me that with a few finiſhing touches he might eaſily be converted into a <hi>Caliban</hi> for <hi>the Tempeſt,</hi> and, when that is done, I ſhall not totally deſpair of his obtaining a niche in the Shakſpere gallery.</p>
                  <p>It has been common with the great maſters <hi>Rubens, Vandyke,</hi> Sir <hi>Joſhua Reynolds</hi> and others, when they paint a warrior, or other great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, on horſeback, to throw a dwarf, or ſome ſuch contraſted figure, into the back-ground: Should any artiſt be in want of ſuch a thing, I can very readily ſupply him with my hare-lipped boy; if otherwiſe, I am not totally without hopes that he may ſuit ſome Spaniſh grandee, when any ſuch ſhall viſit this country upon his travels, or in the character of ambaſſador from that illuſtrious court.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude I ſhall beg leave to obſerve, that I have a compleat ſet of ready-made devils, that would do honour to Saint Antony, or any other perſon, who may be in want of ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companiments to ſet off the ſelf-denying virtues
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0600700105:110"/>
of his character: I have alſo a fine parcel of murdered innocents, which I meant to have filled up with the ſtory of Herod; but if any gentleman thinks fit to lay the ſcene in Ghent, and make a modern compoſition of it, I am bold to ſay my pretty babes will not diſgrace the pathos of the ſubject, nor violate the <hi>Coſtuma.</hi> I took a notable ſketch of a man hanging, and ſeized him juſt in the dying twitches, before the laſt ſtretch gave a ſtiffneſs and rigidity unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the human figure; this I would willingly accommodate to the wiſhes of any lady, who is deſirous of preſerving a portrait of her lover, friend or huſband in that intereſting attitude.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, <hi>cum multis aliis,</hi> are part of my ſtock on hand, and I hope, upon my arrival at my lodgings in Blood-bowl-alley, to exhibit them with much credit to myſelf, and to the entire ſatisfaction of ſuch of my neighbours in that quarter, as may incline to patronize the fine arts, and reſtore the credit of this drooping country.</p>

            <p>THE humours and characters of a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous county town at a diſtance from the capital furniſh matter of much amuſement to a curious obſerver. I have now been ſome weeks reſident in a place of this deſcription, where I have been continually treated with the private lives and little ſcandalizing anecdotes of almoſt every perſon of any note in it. Having paſſed moſt of my days in the capital, I could not but remark the ſtriking difference between it and theſe ſubordinate capitals in this particular: in London we are in the habit of looking to our own affairs, and caring little about thoſe, with whom we have no dealings: here every body's buſineſs ſeems to be no leſs his neighbour's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern than his own: A ſet of tattling goſſips (including all the idlers in the place male as well
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0600700105:112"/>
as female) ſeem to have no other employment for their time or tongue, but to run from houſe to houſe, and circulate their ſilly ſtories up and down. A few of theſe contemptible impertinents I ſhall now deſcribe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miſs Penelope Tabby</hi> is an antiquated maiden of at leaſt forty years ſtanding, a great obſerver of decorum, and particularly hurt by the behaviour of two young ladies, who are her next-door neighbours, for a cuſtom they have of lolling out of their windows and talking to fellows in the ſtreet: The charge cannot be denied, for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a practice theſe young ladies indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in very freely; but on the other hand it muſt be owned Miſs Pen Tabby is alſo in the habit of lolling out of her window at the ſame time to ſtare at them, and put them to ſhame for the levity of their conduct: They have alſo the crime proved upon them of being unpardonably handſome, and this they neither can nor will attempt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict. Miſs Pen Tabby is extremely regular at morning prayers, but ſhe complains heavily of a young ſtaring fellow in the pew next to her own, who violates the ſolemnity of the ſervice by ogling her at her devotions: He has a way of leaning over the pew, and dangling a white hand ornamented with a flaming paſte ring, which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0600700105:113"/>
ſometimes plays the lights in her eyes, ſo as to make them water with the reflection, and Miſs Pen has this very natural remark ever ready on the occaſion—<q rend="inline">"Such things, you know, are apt to take off one's attention."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another of this illuſtrious junto is <hi>Billy Bachelor,</hi> an old unmarried petit-maitre: Billy is a courter of antient ſtanding; he abounds in anecdotes not of the freſheſt date, nor altogether of the moſt intereſting ſort; for he will tell you how ſuch and ſuch a lady was dreſſed, when he had the honour of handing her into the drawing-room; he has a court-atalantis of his own, from which he can favour you with ſome hints of ſly doings amongſt maids of honour, particularly of a certain dubious ducheſs now deceaſed, (for he names no names) who appeared at a certain maſquerade <hi>in puris naturalibus,</hi> and other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diſcoveries, which all the world has long ago known, and long ago been tired of. Billy has a ſmattering in the fine arts, for he can nett purſes and make admirable coffee and write ſonnets; he has the beſt receipt in nature for a dentifrice, which he makes up with his own hands, and gives to ſuch ladies, as are in his favour and have an even row of teeth: He can boaſt ſome ſkill in muſic, for he plays Barberini's
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0600700105:114"/>
minuet to admiration, and accompanies the airs in the Beggar's opera on his flute in their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal taſte: He is alſo a playhouſe critic of no mean pretenſions, for he remembers Mrs. Wof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fington, and Quin and Mrs. Cibber; and when the players come to town, Billy is greatly looked up to, and has been known to lead a clap, where nobody but himſelf could find a reaſon for clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at all. When his vanity is in the cue, Billy Bachelor can talk to you of his amours, and upon occaſion ſtretch the truth to ſave his credit; particularly in accounting for a certain old lameneſs in his knee-pan, which ſome, who are in the ſecret, know was got by being kicked out of a coffee-houſe, but which to the world at large he aſſerts was incurred by leaping out of a window to ſave a lady's reputation, and eſcape the fury of an enraged huſband.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr. Pyeball</hi> is a dignitary of the church, and a mighty proficient in the <hi>belles lettres:</hi> He tells you Voltaire was a man of ſome fancy and had a knack of writing, but he bids you beware of his principles, and doubts if he had any more chriſtianity than Pontius Pilate: He has wrote an epigram againſt a certain contemporary hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, which cuts him up at a ſtroke. By a happy jargon of profeſſional phraſes with a kind
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0600700105:115"/>
of Socratic mode of arguing, he has ſo bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boozled the dons of the cathedral as to have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a total revolution in their church muſic, making Purcell, Crofts and Handel give place to a quaint, quirkiſh ſtile, little leſs capricious than if the organiſt was to play cotillons and the dean and chapter dance to them. The doctor is a mighty admirer of thoſe ingenious publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are intitled <hi>The flowers</hi> of the ſeveral authors they are ſelected from; this ſhort cut to Parnaſſus not only ſaves him a great deal of round-about riding, but ſupplies him with many an apt couplet for off-hand quotations, in which he is very expert and has beſides a clever knack of weaving them into his pulpit eſſays (for I will not call them ſermons) in much the ſame way as <hi>Tiddy-Doll</hi> ſtuck plumbs on <hi>his ſhort pigs and his long pigs and his pigs with a curley tail.</hi> By a proper ſprinkling of theſe ſpiritual noſegays, and the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſoft inſinuating addreſs, doctor Pyeball is univerſally cried up as a very pretty genteel preacher, one who underſtands the politeneſs of the pulpit and does not ſurfeit well-bred people with more religion than they have ſtomachs for. Amiable Miſs <hi>Pen Tabby</hi> is one of his warmeſt admirers, and declares Doctor Pyeball in his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0600700105:116"/>

            <p>Elegant Mrs. <hi>Dainty</hi> is another ornament of this charming coterie: She is ſeparated from her huſband, but the eye of malice never ſpied a ſpeck upon her virtue; his manners were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable; ſhe, good lady, never gave him the leaſt provocation, for ſhe was always ſick and moſtly confined to her chamber in nurſing a delicate conſtitution: Noiſes racked her head; company ſhook her nerves all to pieces; in the country ſhe could not live, for country doctors and apothecaries knew nothing of her caſe; in London ſhe could not ſleep, unleſs the whole ſtreet was littered with ſtraw. Her huſband was a man of no refinement; <hi>all the fine feelings of the human heart</hi> were heathen Greek to him; he loved his friend, had no quarrel with his bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and, coming from his club one night a little fluſtered, his horrid dalliances threw Mrs. Dainty into ſtrong hyſterics, and the covenanted truce being now broken, ſhe kept no further terms with him and they ſeparated. It was a ſtep of abſolute neceſſity, for ſhe declares her life could no otherwiſe have been ſaved; his boiſterous
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0600700105:117"/>
familiarities would have been her death. She now leads an uncontaminated life, ſupporting a feeble frame by medicine, ſipping her tea with her dear quiet friends every evening, chatting over the little news of the day, ſighing charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly when ſhe hears any evil of her kind neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, turning off her femme-de-chambre once a week or thereabouts, fondling her lap-dog, who is a dear ſweet pretty creature and ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and taking the air now and then on a pillion behind faithful John, who is ſo careful of her, and ſo handy, and at the ſame time one of the ſtouteſt, handſomeſt, beſt-limbed lads in all England.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Hugo Fitz-Hugo</hi> is a decayed baronet of a family ſo very antient, that they have long ſince worn out the eſtate that ſupported them: Sir Hugo knows his own dignity none the leſs, and keeps a little ſnivelling boy, who can ſcarce move under the load of worſted lace, that is plaiſtered down the edges and ſeams of his livery: He leaves a viſiting card at your door, ſtuck as full of emblems as an American paper dollar. Sir Hugo abominates a tradeſman; his olfactory nerves are tortured with the ſcent of a grocer, or a butcher, quite acroſs the way, and as for a tallow-chandler he can wind him to the very
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0600700105:118"/>
end of the ſtreet; theſe are people, whoſe viſits he cannot endure; their very bills turn his ſtomach upſide down. Sir Hugo inveighs againſt modern manners as ſeverely as Cato would againſt French cookery; he notes down omiſſions in punctilio as a merchant does bills for proteſting; and in cold weather Sir Hugo is of ſome uſe, for he ſuffers no man to turn his back to the fire and ſcreen it from the company who ſit round: He holds it for a ſoleciſm in good-breeding for any man to touch a lady's hand without his glove: This as a general maxim Miſs <hi>Pen Tabby</hi> agrees to, but doubts whether there are not ſome caſes when it may be waved: He anathematizes the hereſy of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's ſitting at the head of a lady's table, and contends that the honours of the upper diſh are the unalienable rights of the miſtreſs of the family: In ſhort, Sir Hugo Fitz-Hugo has more pride about him than he knows how to diſpoſe of, and yet cannot find in his heart to beſtow one atom of it upon honeſty: From the world he merits no other praiſe but that of having lived ſingle all his life, and, being the laſt of his family; at his deceaſe the Fitz-Hugos will be extinct.</p>

Rhodope has written a book of travels full of moſt enchanting inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which ſome of her admirers ſay was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſketched in the nurſery, and only filled up with little temporary touches in her riper years; I know they make appeal to her ſtile as internal evidence of what they aſſert about the nurſery; but though I am ready to admit that it has every infantine charm, which they diſcover in it, yet I cannot go the length of thinking with them, that a mere infant could poſſibly dictate any thing ſo nearly approaching to the language of men and women: We all know that <hi>Goody Two-ſhoes,</hi> and other amuſing books, though written for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0600700105:120"/>
children, were not written by children. Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe has preſerved ſome ſingular curioſities in her muſeum: She has a bottle of coagulated foam, ſomething like the congealed blood of Saint Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarius; this ſhe maintains was the veritable foam of the tremendous Minotaur of Crete of immortal memory; there are ſome indeed, who profeſs to doubt this, and aſſert that it is nothing more than the ſlaver of a noble Engliſh maſtiff, which went tame about her houſe, and, though formidable to thieves and interlopers, was ever gentle and affectionate to honeſt men. She has a lyre in fine preſervation, held to be the identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal lyre, which <hi>Phaon</hi> played upon, when he won the heart of the amorous <hi>Sappho</hi>; this alſo is made matter of diſpute amongſt the <hi>cognoſcenti</hi>; theſe will have it to be a common Italian inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as the ladies of that country play upon to this day; this is a point they muſt ſettle as they can, but all agree it is a well-ſtrung inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>diſcourſes ſweet muſic.</hi> She has in her cabinet an evergreen of the cypreſs race, which is ſuppoſed to be the very individual ſhrub, that led up the ball when Orpheus fiddled and the groves began a vegetable dance; and this they tell you was the origin of all country dances, now in ſuch general practice.

            <p>NOTHING now remains for compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the literary annals of Greece, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the plan I have proceeded upon in the foregoing volumes, but to give ſome account of the Drama within that period of time, which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0600700105:122"/>
commences with the death of Alexander of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon and concludes with that of Menander, or at moſt extends to a very few years beyond it, when the curtain may figuratively be ſaid to have dropt upon all the glories of the Athenian ſtage.</p>
            <p>This, though the laſt, is yet a brilliant aera, for now flouriſhed <hi>Menander, Philemon, Diphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Apollodorus, Philippides, Poſidippus</hi>; poets no leſs celebrated for the luxuriancy than for the elegance of their genius; all writers of the <hi>New Comedy</hi>; which, if it had not all the wit and fire of the old ſatirical drama produced in times of greater public freedom, is generally reputed to have been far ſuperior to it in delicacy, regularity and decorum. All attacks upon living charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ceaſed with what is properly denominated the <hi>Old Comedy</hi>; the writers of the <hi>Middle Claſs</hi> contented themſelves with venting their raillery upon the works of their dramatic predeceſſors; the perſons and politics of their contemporaries were ſafe; whereas neither the higheſt ſtation, nor the brighteſt talents were any ſure protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the unreſtrained invectives of the comic muſe in her earlieſt ſallies.</p>
            <p>The poets under our preſent review were not however ſo cloſely circumſcribed, as to be afraid
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0600700105:123"/>
of indulging their talent for ridicule and ſatire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on topics of a general nature; without a latitude like this comedy could hardly have exiſted; but this was not all, for amongſt their fragments ſome are to be found, which advance ſentiments and opinions ſo directly in the teeth of the popular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that we cannot but admire at the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary toleration of their pagan audiences. <hi>Juſtin</hi> quotes a paſſage from Menander's comedy of <hi>The Charioteer,</hi> in which an old mendicant is introduced carrying about a painted figure of the Great Mother of the Gods, after the manner of the preſent Popiſh Roſaries, and begging a boon as uſual on thoſe occaſions; the perſon addreſſed for his ſubſcription, contemptuouſly replies—<q rend="inline">"I have no reliſh for ſuch deities as ſtroll about with an old beggar-woman from door to door, nor for that painted cloth you have the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to thruſt into my preſence: Let me tell you, woman, if your Mother of the Gods was good for any thing, ſhe would keep to her own ſtation and take charge of none but thoſe, who merit her protection by their piety and devotion."</q>
This rebuff is of a piece with the ſurly anſwer of the cynic <hi>Antiſthenes,</hi> recorded by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> when, being teazed by theſe mendicants, the philoſopher replied—<q rend="inline">"Let
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0600700105:124"/>
the Gods provide for their own Mother; I am not bound to maintain her."</q>
In another frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, quoted both by <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> Menander breaks forth into a bolder rhapſody, which breathes the ſpirit and nearly the very words of the Hebrew prophets: a perſon (in what drama does not appear) addreſſes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in the ſcene to this effect—<q rend="inline">"If any man, O Pamphilus, thinks that God will be well pleaſed with the ſacrifice of multitudes of oxen or of goats, or of any other victims; or by robing his images in cloth of gold and purple, and decking them out with ivory and emeralds; that man deceives himſelf, and his imaginations are vain; let him rather ſtudy to conciliate God's favour by doing good to all men; let him abſtain from violation and adultery; let him not commit theft or murder through the luſt of money; nay covet not, O Pamphilus, ſo much even as the thread of another's needle, for God is ever preſent and his eye is upon thee."</q>
This will ſerve in the place of many more paſſages, which might be adduced, to prove that the comic poets of this period were not only bold declaimers againſt the vice and immorality of the age they lived in, but that they ventured upon truths and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0600700105:125"/>
doctrines in religion totally irreconcileable to the popular ſuperſtition and idolatries of the heathen world.</p>
            <p>It was on the new comedy of the Greeks that the Roman writers in general founded their's, and this they ſeem to have accompliſhed by the ſervile vehicle of tranſlation: It is ſaid that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence alone tranſlated all Menander's plays, and theſe by the loweſt account amounted to eighty; ſome authorities more than double them, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable number to have been compoſed by a poet, who died at the age of fifty, or very little after.</p>
            <q>

            <p>
               <hi>Menander</hi> was born at Athens, the ſon of <hi>Diopethes</hi> and <hi>Hegeſiſtrata:</hi> He was educated in the ſchool of <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> the peripatetic, Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle's ſucceſſor: At the early age of twenty he began to write for the ſtage, and his paſſions ſeem to have been no leſs forward and impetuous than his genius; his attachment to the fair ſex and eſpecially to his miſtreſs Glycera is upon record, and was vehement in the extreme; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0600700105:126"/>
of his epiſtles to that celebrated courteſan, written in a very ardent ſtile, were collected and made public after his deceaſe: The celebrity of his muſe, and the brilliancy of his wit were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably his chief recommendations to that lady's favour; for it ſhould ſeem that nature had not been very partial to his external, beſides which he ſquinted moſt egregiouſly, and was of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per extremely iraſcible: If we were to take his character as a writer from no other authorities but of the fragments, we ſhould form a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent idea from that of <hi>Pliny,</hi> who ſays he was <hi>omnis luxuriae interpres,</hi> and this even <hi>Plutarch</hi> his avowed panegyriſt is candid enough to admit: Ovid alſo ſays—<q>
                  <l>The gay Menander charms each youthful heart,</l>
                  <l>And Love in every fable claims a part.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>However this may be, the remains, which have come down to us, bear the ſtamp of an auſtere and gloomy muſe rather than of a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and voluptuous one; but theſe it muſt be owned prove little; <hi>Terence</hi> is ſuppoſed to have copied all his comedies from Menander, except the <hi>Phormio</hi> and the <hi>Hecyra,</hi> and he gives us the beſt inſight into the character of his elegant original.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0600700105:127"/>All Greece ſeems to have joined in lamenting the premature loſs of this celebrated poet, who unfortunately periſhed as he was bathing in the Piraean harbour, to which <hi>Ovid</hi> alludes in his <hi>Ibis</hi>—<q>Comicus ut liquidis periit dum nabat in undis.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This happened in Olymp. CXXII; his firſt comedy, intitled <hi>Orge</hi> was performed in Olymp. CXV, which gives him ſomething leſs than thirty years for the production of more than one hundred plays, and if we take the former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his beginning to write for the ſtage at the age of twenty, it will agree with what we have before ſaid reſpecting the age at which he died.</p>
            <p>Fatal as was the Piraean ſea to the perſon of this lamented poet, poſterity has more cauſe to execrate that barbarous gulph, which has ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up his works; nor his alone, but thoſe of above two hundred other eminent dramatic poets, whoſe labours are totally loſt and extinguiſhed. We have ſome lines of <hi>Callimachus</hi> upon the death of <hi>Menander,</hi> who was one amongſt many of his poetic ſurvivors, that paid the tribute of their ingenious ſorrow to his memory: Nor poets only, but princes bewailed his loſs, particularly <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the ſon of <hi>Lagus,</hi> who loved and favoured
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0600700105:128"/>
him very greatly, and maintained a friendly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with him till his death; ſome of Menander's letters to this prince were publiſhed with thoſe addreſſed to his beloved Glycera.</p>
            <p>Though many great authorities concur in placing Menander decidedly at the head of all the comic writers of his time, yet his contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries muſt have been of a different opinion, or elſe his rivals were more popular with their judges, for out of one hundred and five come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which <hi>Apollodorus</hi> aſcribes to him, he tells us that he obtained only eight prizes, and that <hi>Philemon</hi> in particular triumphed over him in the ſuffrages of the theatre very frequently. If theſe deciſions were ſo glaringly unjuſt and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial as we are taught to believe they were, we have ſome ſort of apology for the ſarcaſtic queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion put to his ſucceſsful competitor, when upon meeting him he ſaid—<q rend="inline">"Do you not bluſh, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon, when you prevail over me?"</q>
This anecdote however at beſt only proves that Menander rated his own merits very highly, and that, if they were unjuſtly treated by thoſe, who decided for Philemon, he laid the blame upon the wrong perſon, and betrayed a very irritable temper upon the occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0600700105:129"/>We have a collection of Menander's frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the titles of ſeventy-three comedies; the fragments conſiſt only of ſhort ſentences, and do not give us the ſpirit and character of the dialogue, much leſs of any one entire ſcene; for though <hi>Hertelius</hi> has gone further than <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Le Clerc</hi> in arranging them under diſtinct topics, and has brought into one view every paſſage of a correſpondent ſort, ſtill it is a mere disjointed medley, intereſting only to the curious, but affording little edification to the generality of readers: Many of them however are to be reſpected for their moral ſentiment, ſome are of a very elevated caſt, and others, (more in number than I could wiſh) of a gloomy, acrimonious and moroſe quality.</p>
            <p>Antient authorities are nevertheleſs ſo loud in the praiſe of Menander, that we cannot doubt of his excellence. <hi>Quintilian</hi> after applauding him for his peculiar addreſs in preſerving the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and diſtinctions proper to every character he introduces on his ſcene, adds in general terms,
<q rend="inline">"that he eclipſes every writer of his claſs, and by the ſuperior brilliancy of his genius throws them all into ſhade."</q>—He condemns the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted judgment of his contemporaries for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0600700105:130"/>
to prefer Philemon on ſo many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and <hi>C. J. Caeſar,</hi> whilſt he is paſſing a compliment upon Terence, ſtiles him only <hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatum Menandrum. Dion Chryſoſtom</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends him as a model for all who ſtudy to excel in oratory,
<q rend="inline">"and let none of our wiſe men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend me,"</q>
he adds,
<q rend="inline">"for preferring Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander to the old comic poets, inaſmuch as his art in delineating the various manners and graces is more to be eſteemed than all the force and vehemence of the antient drama."</q>
There is ſo much claſſical elegance in the lines, which <hi>T. Faber</hi> has prefixed to his edition of <hi>Terence,</hi> particularly in the introductory ſtanza, and this is withal ſo appoſite to the ſubject in hand, that I ſhall conclude this paper by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing it.</p>

            <p>If Menander hath been juſtly celebrated for his faithful pictures of the living manners of the age he wrote in, we cannot but receive a gloomy impreſſion from the dark and diſmal tints, in which theſe ſketches are caſt; and though the age we live in hath follies and failings enough ſtill to feed the comic poet's appetite for ſatire, we may conſole ourſelves in the compariſon of our own time with his, provided the ſtage is to

It is not however improbable but the writers of the <hi>new comedy</hi> might fall with more ſeverity upon general vices to revenge themſelves for the reſtrictions they were ſubjected to with reſpect to perſonalities: Add to this, that as far as the early Chriſtian writers were concerned in ſelecting theſe paſſages, it may well be ſuppoſed they would naturally take the moſt moral and ſententious from amongſt the comedies they quoted, and ſuch as afforded grave and uſeful remarks upon life, harmonizing with their own doctrines and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. More eſpecially it is to be ſuppoſed that they would eagerly catch at any of thoſe paſſages, which exhibit purer and more worthy notions of the Being and Providence of God, than the vulgar herd of Heathens were known to entertain: Of this caſt is the following contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ridicule upon the Pagan ceremony of luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.

I am ſorry to remark that amongſt all the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this poet not one has been preſerved, that is ſtampt with even the ſlighteſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fair ſex: On the contrary I find abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of invective, chiefly againſt marriage and married women, often coarſe and always bitter: I may venture to ſay, if there was a ſingle woman in all Athens, who merited one good word, it is one more than the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny can diſcover in his remains.

In the fragment next enſuing an old man is reproved for the vice of covetouſneſs; there is a delicacy in the manner of it, that well becomes both the age and condition of the ſpeaker, for he is a youth, and ſon to the character, whom he addreſſes: This fragment is extracted from the comedy intitled <hi>Dyſcolus (the Churl)</hi> which Plautus is ſaid to have tranſlated and performed under its original title; but of this only a few fragments remain in our volume of that poet; probably the father herein addreſſed is the perſon who gives name to the comedy—<q>

            <p>THERE is not amongſt all the Greek dramatic poets a more amiable character than <hi>Philemon</hi>: He was a Syracuſan by <hi>Suidas</hi>'s account, but <hi>Strabo</hi> ſays he was born in Solae a city of Cilicia: He was ſome years elder than Menander, and no unworthy rival of that poet, though more frequently ſucceſsful in his compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions with him than the critics in general ſeem to think he deſerved to be: Of this we can form little or no judgment; they, who had acceſs to the works of both authors, had the beſt materials to decide upon. <hi>Apulcius</hi> however ſpeaks rather doubtingly in the compariſon, for he ſays of Philemon that he was <hi>fortaſſe impar</hi>; to which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0600700105:143"/>
he ſubjoins, that
<q rend="inline">"though his frequent triumphs over Menander are not reputable to inſiſt upon, yet there are to be found in him many witty ſtrokes, plots ingeniouſly diſpoſed, diſcoveries ſtrikingly brought to light, charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters well adapted to their parts, ſentiments that accord with human life;"</q>—<hi>Joca non infra ſoccum, ſeria non uſque cothurnum,</hi> viz.

            <p>Philemon lived to the extraordinary age of one hundred and one years, in which time he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ninety comedies; a competent collection it muſt be owned, though not to be compared to the bulk of Menander's productions, who in half the time wrote more in number, and with a rapidity, for which we have his own word,
<q rend="inline">"for when I have once determined upon the plot,"</q>
ſays he, <q rend="inline">"I conſider the work as finiſhed."</q> The longevity of Philemon was the reſult of great temperance and a placid frame of mind: Frugal to a degree that ſubjected him to the charge of avarice, he never weakened his faculties and conſtitution by exceſs, and as he ſummed up all his wiſhes in one rational and moderate petition to Heaven, which throws a moſt favourable light upon his character, it is with pleaſure I record

it.—<q rend="inline">"I pray for health in the firſt place; in the next for ſucceſs in my undertakings; thirdly, for a chearful heart, and laſtly, to be out of debt to all mankind."</q>—This temperate peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems to have been granted in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; he was bleſſed with a long and healthful life; he was ſucceſsful in his undertakings to a degree, which poſterity ſeems to think above his merits, and he triumphed over all his competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors more perhaps through the ſuavity of his manners than from any actual ſuperiority of his talents: That he was of a gay and happy ſpirit there is every reaſon to believe, and his oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſecured to him that independant competency, which put him in poſſeſſion of the final object of his wiſhes. As he lived in conſtant ſerenity of mind, ſo he died without pain of body; for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called together a number of his friends to the reading of a play, which he had newly finiſhed, and ſitting, as was the cuſtom in that ſerene climate, under the open canopy of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, an unforeſeen fall of rain broke up the company juſt when the old man had got into his third act in the very warmeſt intereſts of his fable: His hearers diſappointed by this unlucky check to their entertainment interceded with him for the remainder on the day following, to

which he readily aſſented; and a great company being then aſſembled, whom the fame of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal had brought together, they ſate a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time in eager expectation of the poet, till wearied out with waiting, and unable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his impunctuality, ſome of his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates were diſpatcht in queſt of him, who, having entered his houſe and made their way to his chamber, found the old man dead on his couch, in his uſual meditating poſture, his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures placid and compoſed, and with every ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that indicated a death without pain or ſtruggle.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>Apuleius</hi>'s account, but <hi>Oelian</hi> embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes the ſtory with a viſion, in which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that nine fair damſels appeared to Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and upon his accoſting them as they were going out of the door, demanding why they would leave him, they told him it was becauſe it was not permitted to man to hold converſe with the Immortals: Upon waking from this trance or viſion, Philemon related it to his page, and then getting up returned to his ſtudies, and put the laſt hand to the comedy he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon: <q rend="inline">"That done,"</q> ſays <hi>Oelian,</hi>
               <q rend="inline">"he ſtretched himſelf on his couch and quietly expired."</q>
From this ſilly anecdote he draws
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0600700105:146"/>
an inference, which without his help the world had probaby diſcovered, viz. <hi>That Philemon truly was in favour with the Muſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> varies from both theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in his account of the death of this aged poet; he tells us Philemon was ſuffocated by a ſudden fit of laughter upon ſeeing an aſs, who had found his way into the houſe, devour a plate of figs, which his page had provided for him; that he called out to the boy to drive away the aſs, but when this order was not executed before the animal had emptied the plate, he bade his page pour out a goblet of wine and preſent it to the plunderer to compleat his entertainment; tickled with the pleaſantry of this conceit, and no leſs with the groteſque attitude and adventure of the animal, Philemon was ſeized with a fit of laughing and in that fit expired.</p>
            <p>The fragments of Philemon are in general of a ſentimental, tender caſt, and, though they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force found and ſtrict morality, yet no one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance occurs of that gloomy miſanthropy, that harſh and dogmatizing ſpirit, which too often marks the maxims of his more illuſtrious rival: The following ſpecimen will illuſtrate what I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert—It is clear that our poet has <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> in his eye.

            <p>THE poet <hi>Diphilus</hi> was a native of Sinope, a city of Pontus, and contemporary with Menander. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> applauds him for his comic wit and humour; <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays the ſame and adds a further encomium in reſpect of the ſententious and moral character of his drama. The poet <hi>Plautus</hi> ſpeaks of him in his prologue to the <hi>Caſina,</hi> and acknowledges the excellence of the original upon which he had formed his comedy. He died at Smyrna, a city of Ionia, and was author of one hundred come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, of which we have a liſt of two and thirty titles, and no inconſiderable collection of frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; out of theſe I have ſelected the following example—<q>
                  <l>We have a notable good law at Corinth,</l>
                  <l>Where, if an idle fellow outruns reaſon,</l>
                  <l>Feaſting and junketing at furious coſt,</l>
                  <l>The ſumptuary proctor calls upon him</l>
                  <l>And thus begins to ſift him—You live well,</l>
                  <l>But have you well to live? You ſquander freely,</l>
                  <l>Have you the wherewithal? have you the fund</l>
                  <l>For theſe out-goings? If you have, go on!</l>
                  <l>If you have not, we'll ſtop you in good time</l>
                  <l>Before you outrun honeſty; for he,</l>

               <hi>Philippidas,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Philocles,</hi> was another of this illuſtrious band of contemporary and rival authors: His extreme ſenſibility was the cauſe of his death, for the ſudden tranſport, occaſioned by the unexpected ſucceſs of one of his comedies, put a period to his life; the poet however was at this time very aged. Donatus informs us that Philippidas was in the higheſt favour with <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> to whom he recommended himſelf not by the common modes of flattery, but by his amiable and virtuous qualities; the intereſt he had with Lyſimachus he ever employed to the moſt honourable purpoſes, and thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to confer many great and uſeful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours upon the people of Athens: So highly did his princely patron eſteem this venerable man, that whenever he ſet out upon any expedition, and chanced upon Philippidas is his way, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

               <hi>Poſidippus,</hi> with whom I ſhall conclude, was a Macedonian, born at Caſſandria and the ſon of <hi>Cyniſcus.</hi> Abundant teſtimonies are to be found in the old grammarians of the celebrity of this poet; few fragments of his comedies have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to us, and the titles only of twelve. He may be reckoned the laſt of the comic poets, as it was not till three years after the death of Menander that he began to write for the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian ſtage, and poſterior to him I know of no author, who has bequeathed even his name to poſterity: Here then concludes the hiſtory of the Greek ſtage; below this period it is in vain to ſearch for genius worth recording; Grecian literature and Grecian liberty expired together; a ſucceſſion of ſophiſts, paedagogues and gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians filled the poſts of thoſe illuſtrious wits, whoſe ſpirit, foſtered by freedom, ſoared to ſuch heights as left the Roman poets little elſe except the ſecondary fame of imitation.</p>
            <p>I have now fulfilled what I may be allowed to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0600700105:156"/>
call my literary engagements; in the courſe of which I have expended no ſmall pains and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in dragging from obſcurity relicks buried in the rubbiſh of the darker ages, when the whole world ſeemed to conſpire againſt Genius; when learning had degenerated into ſophiſm, and religion was made a theme of metaphyſical ſubtelty, ſerving, as it ſhould ſeem, no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to puzzle and confound, to inflame the paſſions and to perplex the head. Then it was, the fathers of the church, in whoſe hands theſe authors were, held it a point of conſcience to deſtroy the idols of the ſtage, as they had already deſtroyed the idols of the temple, and to bury heathen wit in the ſame grave with heathen ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; their poets and their gods were to be exterminated alike. To the more enlightened taſte, or rather perhaps to the lucky partiality, of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> alone we owe the preſervation of <hi>Ariſtophanes.</hi> Continually engaged in argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative and controverſial writings there were ſome, who occaſionally condeſcended to quote a paſſage, as it ſerved their purpoſe, from theſe proſcribed comedies, either to help out their wits or illuſtrate their meaning; and theſe ſcraps and ſplinters being ſwept together by ſome few patient collectors, who had charity enough
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0600700105:157"/>
to work upon the wreck, poſterity hath been put into poſſeſſion of theſe gleanings of the comic ſtage of Athens in addition to the more entire and ineſtimable remains of <hi>Ariſtophanes.</hi> It has been my taſk (and I believe it is the firſt of the ſort attempted in our language) to avail myſelf of theſe friendly guides for making ſomething like a regular detail of the names, characters and productions of theſe loſt, but once illuſtrious, poets, and to give to the public ſuch as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the beſt of their fragments in an Engliſh tranſlation. This part of my general undertaking being heavier than all the reſt to myſelf, I was much afraid it would have proved ſo to my readers alſo; but their candid recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe papers in particular, and the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging voice of my profeſt reviewers, have ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that anxiety from my mind, and enabled me to proceed with chearfulneſs to the end.</p>
            <p>There is one part however of theſe papers, in which I conceive I have been miſunderſtood as having carried my attack againſt the moral doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Socrates, and of this I am intereſted to exculpate myſelf; My ſubject led me to refer to certain anecdotes unfavourable to his private character, but I ſtudiouſly marked thoſe paſſages by obſerving that there was no deſign to glance
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0600700105:158"/>
at his moral doctrines, and at the ſame time quoted the authorities upon which thoſe anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes reſt; when any ſcholar will convince me theſe were futile and malicious tales, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract all credit in them and thank him for the conviction: As for the purity of Socrates's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine I never attempted to impeach it; of the purity of his character I muſt continue to think there is much cauſe to doubt. The learned <hi>Biſhop Sherlock</hi> in his fourth diſcourſe may be referred to upon this ſubject: He there ſays <hi>that the corrupt example of Socrates was a dead weight upon the purity of his doctrine, and tended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate ſuperſtition in the world</hi>—Though I am aware that the <hi>corrupt example</hi> here alluded to reſpects his religious practice, yet ſurely if the preacher of Chriſtianity was intereſted to ſhew the <hi>corrupt example</hi> of <hi>Socrates</hi> in this light, the friend of Chriſtianity may be allowed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it in another point of view, and by fair au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities to exhibit what the heathens themſelves have reported of this famous philoſopher, whoſe moral purity is by ſome taken merely upon truſt, by others deſignedly extolled to the ſkies for the ſake of oppoſing character to character, and by an audacious compariſon with Chriſt diſparaging the Divinity of the World's Redeemer. I ſhould
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0600700105:159"/>
expect then, that as far as truth and good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities warrant, I am as free to diſcuſs the private vices and impurities of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> which the learned prelate abovementioned moſt eloquently diſplays in his parallel between Chriſt and that Impoſtor: The Deiſt will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be much intereſted to ſupport his favourite philoſopher, and will care little for the prophet: The modern Platoniſt, who is ingenious to erect a new ſyſtem of natural religion out of the ruins of heathen idolatry, may be zealous to defend the founder of his faith, and his anger I muſt ſubmit to incur; but it is not quite ſo eaſy to bear the reproof of friends, from whom I have not deſerved it, and in whoſe ſervice I have drawn that anger upon myſelf.</p>
            <p>As for my defence of <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> againſt the groundleſs charge of having taken bribes from the enemies of <hi>Socrates</hi> to attack him for the purpoſe of paving the way to his public trial, that I obſerve hath been on all hands admitted; for in truth the facts and dates on which it turns, cannot be conteſted; they are deciſive for his exculpation.</p>

            <p>EASY as it has been to clear <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> from the charge of conſpiring againſt the life of <hi>Socrates,</hi> he would be a hardy advocate, who ſhould attempt to defend his perſonal attack upon that philoſopher in his comedy of <hi>The Clouds.</hi> The outcry has been kept up for ſo many ages, that now to combat it would be a taſk indeed; there are ſo many, who join in it, without having examined into the merits of the caſe, and an appeal to the practice of the ſtage in thoſe times as likewiſe to the comedy itſelf would affect ſo few amongſt the many, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to pronounce upon the offence, that the man, who undertook to ſoften general preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, muſt undertake to tranſlate <hi>The Clouds</hi>; and to transfuſe the original ſpirit of ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition into a modern language would be no eaſy work.</p>

            <p>NICOLAS Pedroſa, a buſy little being, who followed the trades of ſhaver, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon and man-midwife in the town of Madrid, mounted his mule at the door of his ſhop in the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0600700105:188"/>
Plazuela de los Affligidos, and puſhed through the gate of San Bernardino, being called to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in the neighbouring village of Foncarral, upon a preſſing occaſion. Every body knows that the ladies in Spain in certain caſes do not give long warning to practitioners of a certain deſcription, and no body knew it better than Nicolas, who was reſolved not to loſe an inch of his way, nor of his mule's beſt ſpeed by the way, if cudgelling could beat it out of her. It was plain to Nicolas's conviction as plain could be, that his road laid ſtrait forward to the little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in front; the mule was of opinion, that the turning on the left down the hill towards the Prado was the road of all roads moſt familiar and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to herſelf, and accordingly began to diſpute the point of topography with Nicolas by fixing her fore feet reſolutely in the ground, dipping her head at the ſame time between them, and launching heels and crupper furiouſly into the air, in the way of argument. Little Pedroſa, who was armed at heel with one maſſy ſilver ſpur of ſtout, though antient, workmanſhip, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely applied the ruſty rowel to the ſhoulder of his beaſt, driving it with all the good will in the world to the very butt, and at the ſame time, adroitly tucking his blue cloth capa under his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0600700105:189"/>
right arm, and flinging the ſkirt over the left ſhoulder <hi>en cavalier,</hi> began to lay about him with a ſtout aſhen ſapling upon the ears, pole and cheeks of the recreant mule. The fire now flaſhed from a pair of Andaluſian eyes, as black as charcoal and not leſs inflammable, and taking the ſegara from his mouth, with which he had vainly hoped to have regaled his noſtrils in a ſharp winter's evening by the way, raiſed ſuch a thundering troop of angels, ſaints and martyrs, from St. Michael downwards, not forgetting his own nameſake Saint Nicolas de Tolentino by the way, that if curſes could have made the mule to go, the diſpute would have been ſoon ended, but not a ſaint could make her ſtir any other ways than upwards and downwards at a ſtand. A ſmall troop of mendicant friars were at this moment conducting the hoſt to a dying man.—<q rend="inline">"Nicolas Pedroſa,"</q>
ſays an old friar,
<q rend="inline">"be patient with your beaſt and ſpare your blaſphemies; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Balaam."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Ah father,"</q> replied Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſa,
<q rend="inline">"Balaam cudgelled his beaſt till ſhe ſpoke, ſo will I mine till ſhe roars."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Fie, fie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane fellow,"</q>
cries another of the fraternity. <q rend="inline">"Go about your work, friend,"</q> quoth Nicolas,
<q rend="inline">"and let me go about mine; I warrant it is the more preſſing of the two; your patient is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0600700105:190"/>
going out of the world, mine is coming into it."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Hear him,"</q> cries a third,
<q rend="inline">"hear the vile wretch, how he blaſphemes the body of God."</q>—And then the troop paſſed ſlowly on to the tinkling of the bell.</p>
            <p>A man muſt know nothing of a mule's ears, who does not know what a paſſion they have for the tinkling of a bell, and no ſooner had the jing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling chords vibrated in the ſympathetic organs of Pedroſa's beaſt, than boulting forward with a ſudden ſpring ſhe ran roaring into the throng of friars, trampling on ſome and ſhouldering others at a moſt profane rate; when Nicolas availing himſelf of the impetus, and perhaps not able to controul it, broke away and was out of ſight in a moment.
<q rend="inline">"All the devils in hell blow fire into thy tail, thou beaſt of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,"</q>
muttered Nicolas to himſelf, as he ſcampered along, never once looking behind him or ſtopping to apologize for the miſchief he had done to the bare feet and ſhirtleſs ribs of the holy brotherhood.</p>
            <p>Whether Nicolas ſaved his diſtance, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if he did, whether it was a male or female Caſtilian he uſhered into the world, we ſhall not juſt now enquire, contented to await his return in the firſt of the morning next day, when he had no

ſooner diſmounted at his ſhop and delivered his mule to a ſturdy Arragoneſe wench, when Don Ignacio de Santos Aparicio, alguazil mayor of the ſupreme and general inquiſition, put an order into his hand, ſigned and ſealed by the inquiſidor general, for the conveyance of his body to the Caſa, whoſe formidable door preſents itſelf in the ſtreet adjoining to the ſquare, in which Nicolas's brazen baſin hung forth the emblem of his trade.</p>
            <p>The poor little fellow, trembling in every joint and with a face as yellow as ſaffron, dropt a knee to the altar, which fronts the entrance, and croſſed himſelf moſt devoutly; as ſoon as he had aſcended the firſt flight of ſtairs, a porter habited in black opened the tremendous barricade and Nicolas with horror heard the grating of the heavy bolts that ſhut him in. He was led through paſſages and vaults and melancholy cells, till he was delivered into the dungeon, where he was finally left to his ſolitary meditations. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs being! what a ſcene of horror.—Nicolas felt all the terrors of his condition, but being an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daluſian and like his countrymen of a lively ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, he began to turn over all the reſources of his invention for ſome happy fetch, if any ſuch might occur, for helping him out of the diſmal
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0600700105:192"/>
limbo he was in: He was not long to ſeek for the cauſe of his misfortune; his adventure with the barefooted friars was a ready ſolution of all difficulties of that nature, had there been any: There was however another thing, which might have troubled a ſtouter heart than Nicolas's—He was a Jew.—This of a certain would have been a ſtaggering item in a poor devil's confeſſion, but then it was a ſecret to all the world but Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas, and Nicolas's conſcience did not juſt then urge him to reveal it: He now began to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haul the inventory of his perſonals about him, and with ſome ſatisfaction counted three little medals of the bleſſed virgin, two Agnus Deis, a Saint Nicolas de Tolentino and a formidable ſtring of beads all pendant from his neck and within his ſhirt; in his pockets he had had a paper of dried figs, a ſmall bundle of ſegaras, a caſe of lancets, ſquirt and forceps, and two old razors in a leathern envelope; theſe he had delivered one by one to the alguazil, who firſt arreſted him,—<q rend="inline">"and let him make the moſt of them,"</q> ſaid he to himſelf,
<q rend="inline">"they can never prove me an Iſraelite by a caſe of razors."</q>—Upon a cloſer rummage however he diſcovered in a ſecret pocket a letter, which the alguazil had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, and which his patient Donna Leonora de
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0600700105:193"/>
Caſafonda had given him in charge to deliver as directed—<q rend="inline">"Well, well,"</q> cried he,
<q rend="inline">"let it paſs; there can be no myſtery in this harmleſs ſcrawl; a letter of advice to ſome friend or relation, I'll not break the ſeal; let the fathers read it, if they like, 'twill prove the truth of my depoſition, and help out my excuſe for the hurry of my errand, and the unfortunate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of my damned refractory mule."</q>—And now no ſooner had the recollection of the wayward mule croſſed the brain of poor Nicolas Pedroſa, than he began to blaſt her at a furious rate—<q rend="inline">"The ſcratches and the ſcab to boot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thy ſcurvy hide,"</q>
quoth he,
<q rend="inline">"thou aſs-begotten baſtard, whom Noah never let into his ark! The vengeance take thee for an uncreated barren beaſt of promiſcuous gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration! What devil's crotch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Oh! that I had the art of Simon Magus to conjure thee into this dungeon in my ſtead; but I warrant thou art chewing thy barley ſtraw without any pity for thy wretched maſter,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0600700105:194"/>
whom thy jade's tricks have delivered bodily to the tormentors, to be ſport of theſe uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed ſons of Dagon."</q>
And now the cell door opened, when a ſavage figure entered carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a huge parcel of clanking fetters, with a collar of iron, which he put round the neck of poor Pedroſa, telling him with a truly diabolic grin, whilſt he was rivetting it on, that it was a proper cravat for the throat of a blaſphemer.—<q rend="inline">"Jeſu-Maria,"</q> quoth Pedroſa,
<q rend="inline">"is all this fallen upon me for only cudgelling a reſtive mule?"</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Aye,"</q> cried the demon,
<q rend="inline">"and this is only a taſte of what is to come,"</q>
at the ſame time ſlipping his pincers from the ſcrew he was forcing to the head, he caught a piece of fleſh in the forceps and wrenched it out of his cheek, laughing at poor Nicolas, whilſt he roared aloud with the pain, telling him it was a juſt reward for the torture he had put him to awhile ago, when he tugged at a tooth, till he broke it in his jaw. <q rend="inline">"Ah, for the love of Heaven,"</q> cried Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſa,
<q rend="inline">"have more pity on me; for the ſake of Saint Nicolas de Tolentino, my holy patron, be not ſo unmerciful to a poor barber-ſurgeon, and I will ſhave your worſhip's beard for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as long as I have life"</q>
One of the meſſengers of the auditory now came in, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0600700105:195"/>
bade the fellow ſtrike off the priſoner's fetters, for that the holy fathers were in council and demanded him for examination.
<q rend="inline">"This is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary,"</q>
quoth the tormentor,
<q rend="inline">"I ſhould not have expected it this twelvemonth to come."</q>
Pedroſa's fetters were ſtruck off; ſome brandy was applied to ſtaunch the bleeding of his cheeks; his hands and face were waſhed, and a ſhort jacket of coarſe ticking thrown over him, and the meſſenger with an aſſiſtant taking him each under an arm led him into a ſpacious chamber, where at the head of a long table ſate his excellency the inquiſidor general with ſix of his aſſeſſors, three on each ſide the chair of ſtate: The alguazil mayor, a ſecretary and two notaries with other officers of the holy council were attending in their places.</p>
            <p>The priſoner was placed behind a bar at the foot of the table between the meſſengers, who brought him in, and having made his obeiſance to the awful preſence in the moſt ſupplicating manner, he was called upon according to the uſual form of queſtions by one of the junior judges to declare his name, parentage, profeſſion, age, place of abode, and to anſwer various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories of the like trifling nature: His excellency the inquiſidor general now opened
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0600700105:196"/>
his reverend lips, and in a ſolemn tone of voice, that penetrated to the heart of the poor trembling priſoner, interrogated him as follows—</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Nicolas Pedroſa, we have liſtened to the account you give of yourſelf, your buſineſs and connections, now tell us for what offence, or offences, you are here ſtanding a priſoner before us: Examine your own heart, and ſpeak the truth from your conſcience without prevarication or diſguiſe."</q>
               <q rend="inline">"May it pleaſe your excellency,"</q>
replied Pedroſa,
<q rend="inline">"with all due ſubmiſſion to your holineſs and this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend aſſembly, my moſt equitable judges, I conceive I ſtand here before you for no worſe a crime, than that of cudgelling a refractory mule; an animal ſo reſtive in its nature, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der correction of your holineſs be it ſpoken) that although I were bleſt with the forbearance of holy Job, (for like him too I am married and my patience hath been exerciſed by a wife) yet could I not forbear to ſmite my beaſt for her obſtinacy, and the rather becauſe I was ſummoned in the way of my profeſſion, as I have already made known to your moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful ears, upon a certain crying occaſion, which would not admit of a moment's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay."</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0600700105:197"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Recollect yourſelf, Nicolas,"</q> ſaid his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency the inquiſidor general,
<q rend="inline">"was there nothing elſe you did, ſave ſmiting your beaſt?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I take ſaint Nicolas de Tolentino to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,"</q>
replied he,
<q rend="inline">"that I know of no other crime, for which I can be reſponſible at this righteous tribunal, ſave ſmiting my unruly beaſt."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Take notice, brethren,"</q> exclaimed the inquiſidor,
<q rend="inline">"this unholy wretch holds trampling over friars to be no crime."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pardon me, holy father,"</q> replied Nicolas,
<q rend="inline">"I hold it for the worſt of crimes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willingly ſurrender my refractory mule to be dealt with as you ſee fit, and if you impale her alive it will not be more than ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Your wits are too nimble, Nicolas,"</q> cried the judge;
<q rend="inline">"have a care they do not run away with your diſcretion: Recollect the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies you uttered in the hearing of thoſe pious people."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I humbly pray your excellency,"</q> anſwered the priſoner,
<q rend="inline">"to recollect that anger is a ſhort madneſs, and I hope allowances will be made by your holy council for words ſpoke
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0600700105:198"/>
in haſte to a rebellious mule: The prophet Balaam was thrown off his guard with a ſimple aſs, and what is an aſs compared to a mule? If your excellency had ſeen the lovely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that was ſcreaming in agony till I came to her relief, and how fine a boy I uſhered into the world, which would have been loſt but for my aſſiſtance, I am ſure I ſhould not be condemned for a few haſty words ſpoke in paſſion."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sirrah!"</q> cried one of the puiſny judges, <q rend="inline">"reſpect the decency of the court."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Produce the contents of this fellow's poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets before the court,"</q>
ſaid the preſident, <q rend="inline">"lay them on the table."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Monſter,"</q> reſumed the aforeſaid puiſny judge taking up the forceps,
<q rend="inline">"what is the uſe of this diabolical machine?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pleaſe your reverence,"</q> replied Pedroſa, <q rend="inline">"<hi>aptum eſt ad extrahendos foetus.</hi>"—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Unnatural wretch,"</q>
again exclaimed the judge,
<q rend="inline">"you have murdered the mother."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The Mother of God forbid,"</q> exclaimed Pedroſa,
<q rend="inline">"I believe I have a proof in my pocket, that will acquit me of that charge;"</q>
and ſo ſaying, he tendered the letter we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0600700105:199"/>
made mention of: The ſecretary took it, and by command of the court read as follows:<q>
                  <p>Senor Don Manuel de Herrera,</p>
                  <p>When this letter, which I ſend by Nicolas Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſa, ſhall reach your hands, you ſhall know that I am ſafely delivered of a lovely boy after a dangerous labour, in conſideration of which I pray you to pay to the ſaid Nicolas Pedroſa the ſum of twenty gold piſtoles, which ſum his excellency—</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Hold,"</q> cried the inquiſidor general, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing haſtily from his ſeat, and ſnatching away the letter,
<q rend="inline">"there is more in this than meets the eye: Break up the court; I muſt take an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this priſoner in private."</q>

            <p>AS ſoon as the room was cleared the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor general beckoning to the priſoner to follow him, retired into a private cloſet, where throwing himſelf careleſsly into an arm chair, he turned a gracious countenance upon the poor affrighted accoucheur, and bidding him ſit down
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0600700105:200"/>
upon a low ſtool by his ſide, thus accoſted him:—<q rend="inline">"Take heart, ſenor Pedroſa, your impriſonment is not likely to be very tedious, for I have a commiſſion you muſt execute without loſs of time: you have too much conſideration for yourſelf to betray a truſt, the violation of which muſt involve you in inevitable ruin, and can in no degree attaint my character, which is far enough beyond the reach of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: Be attentive therefore to my orders; execute them punctually and keep my ſecret as you tender your own life: Doſt thou know the name and condition of the lady, whom thou haſt delivered?"</q>
Nicolas aſſured him he did not, and his excellency proceeded as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows—<q rend="inline">"Then I tell thee, Nicolas, it is the illuſtrious Donna Leonora de Caſafonda; her huſband is the preſident of Quito and daily expected with the next arrivals from the South Seas; now, though meaſures have been taken for detaining him at the port, wherever he ſhall land, till he ſhall receive further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet you muſt be ſenſible Donna Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora's ſituation is ſomewhat delicate: It will be your buſineſs to take the ſpeedieſt meaſures for her recovery, but as it ſeems ſhe has had a dangerous and painful labour, this may be a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0600700105:201"/>
work of more time than could be wiſhed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome medicines more efficacious than common are adminiſtered: Art thou acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any ſuch, friend Nicolas?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"So pleaſe your excellency,"</q>
quoth Nicolas, my
<q rend="inline">"proceſſes have been tolerably ſucceſsful; I have bandages and cataplaſms with oils and conſerves, that I have no cauſe to complain of; they will reſtore nature to it's proper ſtate in all decent time."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Thou talkeſt like a fool, friend Nicolas,"</q>
interrupting him, ſaid the inquiſidor;
<q rend="inline">"What telleſt thou me of thy ſwathings and ſwadlings? quick work muſt be wrought by quick medicines: Haſt thou none ſuch in thy botica? I'll an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it thou haſt not; therefore look you, ſirrah, here is a little vial compounded by a famous chymiſt; ſee that you mix it in the next apozem you adminiſter to Donna Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora; it is the moſt capital ſedative in nature; give her the whole of it, and let her huſband return when he will, depend upon it he will make no diſcoveries from her."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Humph!"</q> quoth Nicolas within himſelf,
<q rend="inline">"Well ſaid, inquiſidor!"</q>
He took the vial with all poſſible reſpect, and was not wanting in profeſſions of the moſt inviolable fidelity and ſecrecy—<q rend="inline">"No
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0600700105:202"/>
more words, friend Nicolas,"</q>
quoth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſidor,
<q rend="inline">"upon that ſcore; I do not believe thee one jot the more for all thy promiſes, my dependance is upon thy fears and not thy faith; I fancy thou haſt ſeen enough of this place not to be willing to return to it once for all."</q>—Having ſo ſaid, he rang a bell, and ordered Nicolas to be forthwith liberated, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the meſſenger return his clothes inſtantly to him with all that belonged to him, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlipt a purſe into his hand well filled with doubloons, he bade him be gone about his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and not ſee his face again till he had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his commands.</p>
            <p>Nicolas boulted out of the porch without taking leave of the altar, and never checked his ſpeed till he found himſelf fairly houſed under ſhelter of his own beloved braſs baſin.—<q rend="inline">"Aha!"</q> quoth Nicolas,
<q rend="inline">"my lord inquiſidor, I ſee the king is not likely to gain a ſubject more by your intrigues: A pretty job you have ſet me about; and ſo, when I have put the poor lady to reſt with your damned ſedative, my tongue muſt be ſtopt next to prevent its blabbing: But I'll ſhew you I was not born in Andaluſia for nothing."</q>
Nicolas now opened a ſecret drawer and took out a few pieces
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0600700105:203"/>
of money, which in fact was his whole ſtock of caſh in the world; he loaded and primed his piſtols and carefully lodged them in the houſers of his ſaddle, he buckled to his ſide his truſty ſpada, and haſtened to capariſon his mule. <q rend="inline">"Ah, thou imp of the old one,"</q> quoth he as he entered the ſtable,
<q rend="inline">"art not aſhamed to look me in the face? But come, huſſey, thou oweſt me a good turn methinks, ſtand by me this once, and be friends for ever! thou art in good caſe, and if thou wilt put thy beſt foot foremoſt, like a faithful beaſt, thou ſhalt not want for barley by the way."</q>
The bargain was ſoon ſtruck between Nicolas and his mule, he mounted her in the happy moment and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his courſe towards the bridge of Toledo, which proudly ſtrides with half a dozen lofty arches over a ſtream ſcarce three feet wide, he found himſelf as completely in a deſart in half a mile's riding, as if he had been dropt in the center of Arabia petraea. As Nicolas's journey was not a tour of curioſity, he did not amuſe himſelf with a peep at Toledo, or Talavera, or even Merida by the way; for the ſame reaſon he took a <hi>circumbendibus</hi> round the frontier town of Badajoz, and croſſing a little brook refreſhed his mule with the laſt draught of Spaniſh water, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0600700105:204"/>
inſtantly congratulated himſelf upon entering the territory of Portugal. <q rend="inline">"Brava!"</q> quoth he, patting the neck of his mule,
<q rend="inline">"thou ſhalt have a ſupper this night of the beſt ſieve-meat that Eſtremadura can furniſh: We are now in a country where the ſcattered flock of Iſrael fold thick and fare well."</q>
He now began to chaunt the ſong of Solomon, and gently ambled on in the joy of his heart.</p>
            <p>When Nicolas at length reached the city of Liſbon, he hugged himſelf in his good fortune; ſtill he recollected that the inquiſition has long arms, and he was yet in a place of no perfect ſecurity. Our adventurer had in early life acted as aſſiſtant ſurgeon in a Spaniſh frigate bound to Buenos Ayres, and being captured by a Britiſh man of war and carried into Jamaica, had very quietly paſſed ſome years in that place as jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyman apothecary, in which time he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a tolerable acquaintance with the Engliſh language: No ſooner then did he diſcover the Britiſh enſign flying on the poop of an Engliſh frigate then lying in the Tagus, than he eagerly caught the opportunity of paying a viſit to the ſurgeon, and finding he was in want of a mate, offered himſelf and was entered in that capacity for a cruize againſt the French and Spaniards,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0600700105:205"/>
with whom Great Britain was then at war. In this ſecure aſylum Nicolas enjoyed the firſt happy moments he had experienced for a long time paſt, and being a lively good-humoured little fellow, and one that touched the guitar and ſung ſequidillas with a tolerable grace, he ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended himſelf to his ſhip-mates and grew in favour with every body on board from the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the cook's mate.</p>
            <p>When they were out upon their cruize hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Spaniſh coaſt, it occurred to Nicolas that the inquiſidor general at Madrid had told him of the expected arrival of the preſident of Quito, and having imparted this to one of the lieutenants, he reported it to the captain, and, as the intelligence ſeemed of importance, he availed himſelf of it by hawling into the track of the homeward-bound galleons, and great was the joy, when at the break of the morning the man at the maſt-head announced a ſquare-rigged veſſel in view: The ardor of a chace now ſet all hands at work, and a few hours brought them near enough to diſcern that ſhe was a Spaniſh frigate and ſeemingly from a long voyage: Little Pedroſa, as alert as the reſt, ſtript himſelf for his work and repaired to his poſt in the cock-pit, whilſt the thunder of the guns rolled inceſſantly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0600700105:206"/>
overhead; three cheers from the whole crew at length announced the moment of victory, and a few more minutes aſcertained the good news that the prize was a frigate richly laden from the South Seas with the governor of Quito and his ſuite on board.</p>
            <p>Pedroſa was now called upon deck and ſent on board the prize as interpreter to the firſt lieutenant, who was to take poſſeſſion of her. He found every thing in confuſion, a deck covered with the ſlain and the whole crew in conſternation at an event they were in no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree prepared for, not having received any inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a war. He found the officers in general and the paſſengers without exception under the moſt horrid impreſſions of the Engliſh, and expecting to be plundered and perhaps but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chered without mercy. Don Manuel de Caſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonda the governor, whoſe countenance beſpoke a conſtitution far gone in a decline, had thrown himſelf on a ſopha in the laſt ſtate of deſpair and given way to an effuſion of tears; when the lieutenant entered the cabin he roſe trembling from his couch and with the moſt ſupplicating action preſented to him his ſword, and with it a caſket which he carried in his other hand; as he tendered theſe ſpoils to his conqueror, whether
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0600700105:207"/>
through weakneſs or of his own will, he made a motion of bending his knee; the generous Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, ſhocked at the unmanly overture, caught him ſuddenly with both hands, and turning to Pedroſa, ſaid aloud—<q rend="inline">"Convince this gentleman he is fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into the hands of an honourable enemy."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Is it poſſible!"</q> cried Don Manuel, and lifting up his ſtreaming eyes to the countenance of the Britiſh officer, ſaw humanity, valour and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pity ſo ſtrongly charactered in his youthful features, that the conviction was irreſiſtible. <q rend="inline">"Will he not accept my ſword,"</q> cried the Spaniard?
<q rend="inline">"He deſires you to wear it, till he has the honour of preſenting you to his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Ah then he has a captain,"</q> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Don Manuel,
<q rend="inline">"his ſuperior will be of another way of thinking; tell him this caſket contains my jewels; they are valuable; let him preſent them as a lawful prize, which will enrich the captor; his ſuperior will not heſitate to take them from me."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"If they are your excellency's private property,"</q>
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Pedroſa,
<q rend="inline">"I am ordered to aſſure you, that if your ſhip was loaded with jewels, no Britiſh officer in the ſervice of his king will take them at your hands; the ſhip and effects of his Catholic Majeſty are the only
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0600700105:208"/>
prize of the captors; the perſonals of the paſſengers are inviolate."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Generous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!"</q>
exclaimed Don Manuel,
<q rend="inline">"how greatly have I wronged thee!"</q>—The boats of the Britiſh frigate now came alongſide and part of the crew were ſhifted out of the prize, taking their clothes and trunks along with them, in which they were very cordially aſſiſted by their conquerors. The barge ſoon after came aboard with an officer in the ſtern-ſheets, and the crew in their white ſhirts and velvet caps, to eſcort the governor and the ſhip's captain on board the frigate, which lay with her ſails to the maſt awaiting their arrival; the accommodation ladder was ſlung over the ſide and manned for the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who were received on the gang-way by the ſecond lieutenant, whilſt perfect ſilence and the ſtricteſt diſcipline reigned in the ſhip, where all were under the decks and no inquiſitive curious eyes were ſuffered to wound the feelings of the conquered even with a glance; in the door of his cabin ſtood the captain, who received them with that modeſt complaiſance, which does not revolt the unfortunate by an overſtrained polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he was a man of high birth and elegant manners with a heart as benevolent as it was brave: Such an addreſs ſet off with a perſon
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0600700105:209"/>
finely formed and perfectly engaging could not fail to impreſs the priſoners with the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ideas, and as Don Manuel ſpoke French fluently, he could converſe with the Britiſh captain without the help of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter: As he expreſſed an impatient deſire of being admitted to his parole, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſit friends and connections, from which he had been long ſeparated, he was overjoyed to hear that the Engliſh ſhip would carry her prize into Liſbon; and that he would there be ſet on ſhore and permitted to make the beſt of his way from thence to Madrid; he talked of his wife with all the ardor of the moſt impaſſioned lover, and apologized for his tears by imputing them to the agony of his mind and the infirmity of his health under the dread of being longer ſeparated from an object ſo dear to his heart and on whom he doated with the fondeſt affection. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous captor indulged him in theſe converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, being a huſband himſelf, knew how to allow for all the tenderneſs of his ſenſations. <q rend="inline">"Ah, ſir,"</q> cried Don Manuel,
<q rend="inline">"would to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it were in my power to have the honour of preſenting my beloved Leonora to you on our landing at Liſbon—Perhaps,"</q>
added he, turning to Pedroſa, who at that moment entered
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0600700105:210"/>
the cabin,
<q rend="inline">"this gentleman, whom I take to be a Spaniard, may have heard the name of Donna Leonora de Caſafonda; if he has been at Madrid, it is poſſible he may have ſeen her; ſhould that be the caſe he can teſtify to her external charms; I alone can witneſs to the exquiſite perfection of her mind."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Senor Don Manuel,"</q>
replied Pedroſa,
<q rend="inline">"I have ſeen Donna Leonora, and your excellency is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted in all you can ſay in her praiſe; ſhe is of incomparable beauty."</q>
Theſe words threw the uxorious Spaniard into raptures; his eyes ſparkled with delight; the blood ruſhed into his emaciated cheeks and every feature glowed with unutterable joy: He preſſed Pedroſa with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of rapid enquiries, all which he evaded by pleading ignorance, ſaying that he had only had a caſual glance of her, as ſhe paſſed along the Pardo. The embaraſſment however which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied theſe anſwers did not eſcape the Engliſh captain, who ſhortly after drawing Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſa aſide into the ſurgeon's cabin, was by him made acquainted with the melancholy ſituation of that unfortunate lady, and every particular of the ſtory as before related; nay the very vial was produced with it's contents, as put into the hands of Pedroſa by the inquiſidor.</p>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"CAN there be ſuch villainy in man?"</q> cried the Britiſh captain, when Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſa had concluded his detail;
<q rend="inline">"Alas! my heart bleeds for this unhappy huſband: aſſuredly that monſter has deſtroyed Leonora; as for thee, Pedroſa, whilſt the Britiſh flag flies over thy head, neither Spain, nor Portugal, nor Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, nor Devils ſhall annoy thee under it's protection; but if thou ever ventureſt over the ſide of this ſhip and raſhly ſetteſt one foot upon Catholic ſoil, when we arrive at Liſbon, thou art a loſt man."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"I were worſe than a madman,"</q>
replied Nicolas,
<q rend="inline">"ſhould I attempt it."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Keep cloſe in this aſylum then,"</q> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the captain,
<q rend="inline">"and fear nothing: Had it been our fate to have been captured by the Spaniard, what would have become of thee?"—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"In the worſt of extremities,"</q> replied Nicolas,
<q rend="inline">"I ſhould have applied to the inquiſidor's vial; but I confeſs I had no fears of that ſort; a ſhip ſo commanded and ſo manned is in little danger of being carried into a Spaniſh port."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"I hope not,"</q> ſaid the captain,

<q rend="inline">"Thank me, if you will,"</q>
added he,
<q rend="inline">"but thank me as one man ſhould another; let no knees bend in this ſhip but to the name of God.—But now,"</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">"let us turn our thoughts to the ſituation of our unhappy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafonda; we are now drawing near to Liſbon, where he will look to be liberated on his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"By no means let him venture into Spain,"</q>
ſaid Pedroſa;
<q rend="inline">"I am well aſſured there are orders to arreſt him in every port or frontier town, where he may preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"I can well believe it,"</q> replied the

captain;
<q rend="inline">"his piteous caſe will require further deliberation; in the mean time let nothing tranſpire on your part and keep yourſelf out of his ſight as carefully as you can."</q>—This ſaid, the captain left the cabin, and both parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to their ſeveral occupations.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the frigate and her prize caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in the Tagus, Don Manuel de Caſafonda impatiently reminded our captain of his promiſed parole. The painful moment was now come when an explanation of ſome ſort became una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable: The generous Engliſhman with a countenance expreſſive of the tendereſt pity, took the Spaniard's hand in his and ſeating him on a couch beſide him, ordered the centinel to keep the cabin private, and delivered himſelf as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows—</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Senor Don Manuel, I muſt now impart to you an anxiety which I labour under on your account; I have ſtrong reaſon to ſuſpect you have enemies in your own country, who are upon the watch to arreſt you on your landing; when I have told you this, I expect you will repoſe ſuch truſt in my honour and the ſincerity of my regard for you, as not to demand a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explanation of the particulars, on which my intelligence is founded."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Heaven and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0600700105:214"/>
Earth,"</q>
cried the aſtoniſhed Spaniard,
<q rend="inline">"who can be thoſe enemies I have to fear, and what can I have done to deſerve them?"—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"So far I will open myſelf to you,"</q>
anſwered the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<q rend="inline">"as to point out the principal to you, the inquiſidor general."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"The beſt friend I have in Spain,"</q>
exclaimed the governor,
<q rend="inline">"my ſworn protector, the patron of my fortune: He my enemy! impoſſible."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir,"</q> replied the captain,
<q rend="inline">"if my advice does not meet belief, I muſt ſo far exert my authority for your ſake, as to make this ſhip your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, till I have waited on our miniſter at Liſbon and made the enquiries neceſſary for your ſafety; ſuſpend your judgment upon the ſeeming harſhneſs of this meaſure till I return to you again;"</q>
and at the ſame time riſing from his ſeat, he gave orders for the barge, and leaving ſtrict injunctions with the firſt lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant not to allow of the governor's quitting the frigate, he put off for the ſhore and left the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Spaniard buried in profound and ſilent meditation.</p>
            <p>The emiſſaries of the Inquiſition having at laſt traced Pedroſa to Liſbon, and there gained intelligence of his having entered on board the frigate, our captain had no ſooner turned into
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0600700105:215"/>
the porch of the hotel at Buenos-Ayres, than he was accoſted by a meſſenger of ſtate with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition from the prime miniſter's office for the ſurrender of one Nicolas Pedroſa, a ſubject of Spain and a criminal, who had eſcaped out of the priſon of the Inquiſition in Madrid, where he ſtood charged of high crimes and miſdemeanors.—As ſoon as this requiſition was explained to our worthy captain, without condeſcending to a word in reply he called for pen and ink, and writing a ſhort order to the officer commanding on board, inſtantly diſpatched the midſhipman, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, to the barge with directions to make the beſt of his way back to the frigate and deliver it to the lieutenant: Then turning to the meſſenger, he ſaid to him in a reſolute tone—<q rend="inline">"That Spaniard is now borne on my books, and before you ſhall take him out of the ſervice of my King, you muſt ſink his ſhip."</q>—Not waiting for a reply, he immediately proceeded without ſtop to the houſe of the Britiſh Miniſter at the further end of the city: Here he found Pedroſa's intelligence with regard to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Quito expreſsly verified, for the order had come down even to Liſbon upon the chance of the Spaniſh frigate's taking ſhelter in that port: To this Miniſter he related the horrid tale, which
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0600700105:216"/>
Pedroſa had delivered to him, and with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence it was determined to forward letters into Spain, which Don Manuel ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to write to his lady and friends at Madrid, and to wait their anſwer before any further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries were imparted to him reſpecting the blacker circumſtances of the caſe: In the mean time it was reſolved to keep the priſoner ſafe in his aſylum.</p>
            <p>The generous Captain loſt no time in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his frigate, where he immediately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to Don Manuel the intelligence he had obtained at the Britiſh Miniſter's—<q rend="inline">"This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,"</q>
cried the afflicted Spaniard,
<q rend="inline">"is a ſtroke I was in no reſpect prepared for; I had fondly perſuaded myſelf there was not in the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Spain a more friendly heart than that of the Inquiſidor's; to my beloved Leonora he had ever ſhewn the tenderneſs of a paternal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from her very childhood; by him our hands were joined; his lips pronounced the nuptial benediction, and through his favour I was promoted to my government: Grant, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no misfortune hath befallen my Leonora! ſurely ſhe cannot have offended him and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his favour."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"As I know him not,"</q> replied the Captain,
<q rend="inline">"I can form no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0600700105:217"/>
of his motives; but this I know, that if a man's heart is capable of cruelty, the fitteſt ſchool to learn it in, muſt be the Inquiſition."</q>
The propoſal was now ſuggeſted of ſending let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into Spain, and the Governor retired to his deſk for the purpoſe of writing them; in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon of the ſame day the Miniſter paid a viſit to the Captain, and receiving a packet from the hands of Don Manuel, promiſed to get it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by a ſafe conveyance according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>In due courſe of time this fatal letter from Leonora opened all the horrible tranſaction to the wretched huſband:—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The guilty hand of an expiring wife, under the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing operation of a mortal poiſon, traces theſe few trembling lines to an injured wretched huſband. If thou haſt any pity for my parting ſpirit fly the ruin that awaits thee and avoid this ſcene of villainy and horror. When I tell thee I have borne a child to the monſter, whoſe poiſon runs in my veins, thou wilt abhor thy faithleſs Leonora; had I ſtrength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to thee the ſubtle machinations, which betrayed me to diſgrace, thou wouldſt pity and perhaps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me. Oh agony! can I write his name?—The Inquiſidor is my murderer—My pen falls from my hand—Farewell for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0600700105:218"/>Had a ſhot paſſed through the heart of Don Manuel, it could not more effectually have ſtopt its motions, than the peruſal of this fatal writing: He dropped lifeleſs on the couch, and but for the care and aſſiſtance of the Captain and Pedroſa in that poſture he had probably expired. Grief like his will not be deſcribed by words, for to words it gave no utterance; 'twas ſuffocating, ſilent woe.</p>
            <p>Let us drop the curtain over this melancholy pauſe in our narration, and attend upon the mournful widower now landing upon Engliſh ground, and conveyed by his humane and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous preſerver to the houſe of a noble Earl, the father of our amiable Captain and a man by his virtues ſtill more conſpicuous than by his rank. Here amidſt the gentle ſolicitudes of a benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent family, in one of the moſt enchanting ſpots on earth, in a climate moſt ſalubrious and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to a conſtitution exhauſted by heat and a heart near broken with ſorrow, the reviving ſpirits of the unfortunate Don Manuel gave the firſt ſymptoms of a poſſible recovery. At the period of a few tranquillizing weeks here paſſed in the boſom of humanity, letters came to hand from the Britiſh Miniſter at Liſbon, in anſwer to a memorial, that I ſhould have ſtated to have
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0600700105:219"/>
been drawn up by the friendly Captain before his departure from that port, with a detail of facts depoſed and ſworn to by Nicolas Pedroſa, which memorial with the documents attached to it was forwarded to the Spaniſh Court by ſpecial expreſs from the Portugueſe premier. By theſe letters it appeared that the high dignity of the perſon impeached by this ſtatement of facts had not been ſufficient to ſcreen him from a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and complete inveſtigation; in the courſe of which facts had been ſo clearly brought home to him by the confeſſion of his ſeveral agents, and the teſtimony of the deceaſed Leonora's attendants together with her own written decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, whilſt the poiſon was in operation, that though no public ſentence had been executed upon the criminal, it was generally underſtood he was either no longer in exiſtence, or in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation never to be heard of any more, till rouſed by the awakening trump he ſhall be ſummoned to his tremendous laſt account. As for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy widower it was fully ſignified to him from authority, that his return to Spain, whether upon exchange or parole, would be no longer oppoſed, nor had he any thing to apprehend on the part of government, when he ſhould there arrive. The
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0600700105:220"/>
ſame was ſignified in fewer words to the excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated Pedroſa.</p>
            <p>Whether Don Manuel de Caſafonda will in time to come avail himſelf of theſe overtures time alone can prove: As for little Nicolas, whoſe prize money has ſet him up in a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able little ſhop in Duke's place, where he breathes the veins and cleanſes the bowels of his Iſraelitiſh brethren in a land of freedom and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, his merry heart is at reſt, ſave only when with fire in his eyes and vengeance on his tongue he anathematizes the Inquiſition, and ſtruts into the ſynagogue every ſabbath with as bold a ſtep and as erect a look, as if he was himſelf High Prieſt of the Temple going to perform ſacrifice upon the re-aſſembling of the ſcattered tribes.</p>

            <p>I Would wiſh no man to deceive himſelf with opinions, which he has not thoroughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon in his ſolitary hours: Till he has <hi>communed with his own heart in his chamber,</hi> it
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0600700105:221"/>
will be dangerous to commit himſelf to its impulſes amidſt the diſtractions of ſociety: In ſolitude he will hear another voice than he has been uſed to hear in the colloquial ſcenes of life; for conſcience, though mute as the antient cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus in the buſtle of the drama, will be found a powerful ſpeaker in ſoliloquy. If I could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that any man in theſe times had ſeriouſly and deliberately reaſoned himſelf into an abſolute contempt of things ſacred, I ſhould expect that ſuch a being ſhould uniformly act up to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in all ſituations, and, having thrown aſide all the reſtraints of religion, ſhould diſcharge from his mind all thoſe fears, apprehenſions and ſolicitudes, that have any connection with the dread of a futurity. But, without knowing what paſſes in the private thoughts of men, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs theſe daring notions, I cannot help obſerving, that, if noiſy clamour be a mark of cowardice, they alſo have the ſymptoms ſtrongly upon them of belying their own conſcience: They are bold in the crowd, and loudeſt in the revels of the feaſt; there they can echo the inſult, daſh the ridicule in the very face of Heaven, and ſtun their conſciences in the roar of the carouſal.</p>
            <p>Let me picture to myſelf a man of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription ſurprized into unexpected ſolitude after
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0600700105:222"/>
the revels of an evening, where he has been the wit of the company at the expence of decency and religion; here his triumphs are over; the plaudits of his comrades no longer encourage him; the lights of the feaſt are extinguiſhed, and he is ſurrendered to darkneſs and reflection: Place him in the midſt of a deſart heath, a lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome traveller in ſome dark tempeſtuous night, and let the elements ſubſcribe their terrors to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter this redoubted champion—<q>Who durſt defy th' Omnipotent.</q>

            <p>If conſiſtency be the teſt of a man's ſincerity, he ought now to hold the ſame language of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance, and with undaunted ſpirit cry out to the elements—<q rend="inline">"Do your worſt, ye blind tools of chance! Since there can be neither intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence nor direction in your rage, I ſet you at nought.

What have I to fear? The

worſt you threaten is a momentary extinction without pain or ſtruggle; and as I only wait on earth till I am weary of life, the moſt you can do is to foreſtall me in the natural rights of ſuicide. I have lived in this world as the only world I have to live in, and have done all things therein as a man, who acts without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to an Hereafter. The moral offices, as they are called, I have ſometimes regarded as a ſyſtem of worldly wiſdom, and where they have not croſſed my purpoſes, or thwarted my pleaſures, I have occaſionally thought fit to comply with them: My proper pride in ſome inſtances, and ſelf-intereſt in others, have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded me from the open violation of a truſt, for it is inconvenient to be detected; and though I acknowledge no remonſtrances from within upon the ſcore of infamy, I do not like the clamours of the crowd. As for thoſe mercenary inducements, which a pretended revelation holds forth as lures for patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrongs and tame reſignation to misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I regard them as derogatory to my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they ſink the very character of virtue by meanly tendering a reverſionary happineſs as the bribe for practiſing it; the doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a future life, in which the obedient are
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0600700105:224"/>
to expect rewards, and the diſobedient are threatened with puniſhments, confutes itſelf by its own internal weakneſs, and is a ſyſtem ſo ſordid in its principle, that it can only be calculated to dupe us into mental ſlavery, and frighten us out of that generous privilege, which is our univerſal birthright, the privilege of diſmiſſing ourſelves out of exiſtence, when we are tired with its conditions."</q>

            <p>Had I fabricated this language for infidelity with the purpoſe of ſtamping greater deteſlation upon its audacity, I had rather bear the blame of having overcharged the character, than to be able (as I now am) to point out a recent publication, which openly avows this ſhameleſs doctrine: But as I do not wiſh to help any anonymous blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer into notice, let the toleration of the times be his ſhelter, and their contempt his anſwer! In the mean time I will take leave to oppoſe to it a ſhort paſſage from a tract, lately tranſlated into Engliſh, intitled <hi>Philoſophical and Critical Enquiries concerning Chriſtianity, by Mr. Bonnet of Geneva</hi>; a work well deſerving an attentive peruſal.</p>
            <q>Here I invite that reader, who can elevate his mind to the contemplation of the ways of Providence, to meditate with me on the admirable methods of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0600700105:225"/>
divine wiſdom in the eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity; a religion, the univerſality of which was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all ages, all places, nations, ranks and ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in life; a religion, which made no diſtinction between the crowned head and that of the loweſt ſubject; formed to diſengage the heart from terreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial things, to ennoble, to refine, to ſublime the thoughts and affections of man; to render him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the dignity of his nature, the importance of his end, to carry his hopes even to eternity, and thus aſſociate him with ſuperior intelligences; a religion, which gave every thing to the ſpirit and nothing to the fleſh; which called its diſciples to the greateſt ſacrifices, becauſe men, who are taught <hi>to fear God alone,</hi> can undergo the ſevereſt trials; a religion in ſhort (to conclude my weak conceptions on ſo ſublime a ſubject) which was the perfection or completion of natural law, the ſcience of the truly wiſe, the refuge of the humble, the conſolation of the wretched; ſo majeſtie in its ſimplicity, ſo ſublime in its doctrine, ſo great in its object, ſo aſtoniſhing in its effects.—I have endeavoured <hi>(ſays this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent author in his concluſion)</hi> to explore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt receſſes of my heart, and having diſcovered no ſecret motive there, which ſhould induce me to reject a religion ſo well calculated to ſupply the defects of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0600700105:226"/>
my reaſon, to comfort me under affliction and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the perfection of my nature, I receive this religion as the greateſt bleſſing Heaven in its good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could conſer upon mankind; and I ſhould ſtill receive it with gratitude, were I to conſider it only as the very beſt and moſt perfect ſyſtem of practical philoſophy. <bibl>(BONNET.)</bibl>

            <p>WHAT a delightful thing it is to find one's ſelf in a company, where tempers har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize and hearts are open; where wit flows without any checks but what decency and good-nature impoſe, and humour indulges itſelf in thoſe harmleſs freaks and caprices, that raiſe a laugh, by which no man's feelings are offended.</p>
            <p>This can only happen to us in a land of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; it is in vain to hope for it in thoſe arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

countries, where men muſt lock the doors againſt ſpies and informers, and muſt entruſt their lives, whilſt they impart their ſentiments, to each other. In ſuch circumſtances a mind, enlightened by education is no longer a bleſſing: What is the advantage of diſcernment, and how is a man profited by his capacity of ſeparating truth from error, if he dare not exerciſe that faculty? It were ſafer to be the blind dupe of ſuperſtition than the intuitive philoſopher, if born within the juriſdiction of an inquiſitorial tribunal. Can a man felicitate himſelf in the glow of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and the gayety of wit, when breathing the air of a country, where ſo dire an inſtrument is in force as a <hi>lettre de cachet?</hi> But experience hath ſhewn us, that if arbitrary monarchs cannot keep their people in ignorance, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in ſlavery; if men read, they will me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate; if they travel, they will compare, and their minds muſt be as dark as the dungeons, which impriſon their perſons, if they do not riſe with indignation againſt ſuch monſtrous maxims, as impriſonment at pleaſure for undefined of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, ſelf-accuſations extorted by torments and ſecret trials, where the priſoner hath neither voice nor advocate. Let thoſe princes, whoſe government is ſo adminiſtered, <hi>make darkneſs</hi>

               <hi>their pavilion,</hi> and draw their very mountains down upon them to ſhut out the light, or expect the period of their deſpotiſm: Illuminated minds will not be kept in ſlavery.</p>
            <p>With a nation ſo free, ſo highly enlightened and ſo eminent in letters as the Engliſh, we may well expect to find the ſocial qualities in their beſt ſtate; and it is but juſtice to the age we live in to confeſs thoſe expectations may be fully gratified: There are ſome perhaps who will not ſubſcribe to this aſſertion, but probably thoſe very people make the diſappointments they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of: If a man takes no pains to pleaſe his company, he is little likely to be pleaſed by his company. Liberty, though eſſential to good ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, may in ſome of it's effects operate againſt it, for as it makes men independant, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance will occaſionally be found to make them arrogant, and none ſuch can be good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; yet let me ſay for the contemporaries I am living with, that within the period of my own acquaintance with the world the reform in it's ſocial manners and habits has been gradual and encreaſing. The feudal haughtineſs of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility has totally diſappeared, and, in place of a proud diſtant reſerve, a pleaſing ſuavity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panionable eaſe have almoſt univerſally obtained
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0600700105:233"/>
amongſt the higher orders: The pedantry of office is gone, and even the animoſity of party is ſo far in the wain, that it ſerves rather to whet our wits than our ſwords againſt each other: The agitation of political opinions is no longer a ſubject fatal to the peace of the table, but takes it's turn with other topics without any breach of good-manners or good fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>It were too much to ſay that there are no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cauſes ſtill ſubſiſting, which annoy our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial comforts, and diſgrace our tempers; they are ſtill too many, and it is amongſt the duties of an <hi>Obſerver</hi> to ſet a mark upon them, though by ſo doing I may run into repetition, for I am not conſcious of having any thing to ſay upon the ſubject, which I have not ſaid before; but if a beggar, who aſks charity, becauſe of his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſhall at length be relieved, an author per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, who enforces his advice, ſhall in the end be liſtened to.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore again and again inſiſt upon it, that there are two ſides to every argument, and that it is the natural and unalienable right of man to be heard in ſupport of his opinion, he having firſt lent a patient ear to the ſpeaker, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſentiments, which oppoſe that opinion: I do humbly apprehend that an overbearing voice
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0600700105:234"/>
and noiſy volubility of tongue are proofs of a very underbred fellow, and it is with regret I ſee ſociety too frequently diſturbed in it's moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable enjoyments by this odious character: I do not ſee that any man hath a right by obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or otherwiſe to lay me under a neceſſity of thinking exactly as he thinks: Though I admit that <hi>from the fullneſs of the heart the tongue ſpeaketh,</hi> I do not admit any ſuperior pretenſions it hath to be <hi>Sir Oracle</hi> from the fullneſs of the pocket. In the name of freedom what claim hath any man to be the tyrant of the table? As well he may avail himſelf of the greater force of his fiſts as of his lungs. Doth ſenſe conſiſt in ſound, or is truth only to be meaſured by the noiſe it makes? Can it be a diſgrace to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, or doth any one loſe by the exchange, who reſigns his own opinion for a better? When I reflect upon the advantages of our public ſchools, where puerile tempers are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by colliſion; upon the mathematical ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſcholaſtic exerciſes of our univerſities, I am no leſs grieved than aſtoniſhed to diſcover ſo few proficients in well-mannered controverſy, ſo very few, who ſeem to make truth the object of their inveſtigation, or will ſpare a few patient moments from the eternal repetition of their
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0600700105:235"/>
own deafening jargon to the temperate reply of men, probably better qualified to ſpeak than themſelves.</p>
            <p>There is another grievance not unfrequent though inferior to this abovementioned, which proceeds jointly from the mixt nature of ſociety and the ebullitions of freedom in this happy country, I mean that roar of mirth and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled flow of ſpirits, which hath more vulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in it than eaſe, more noiſe than gayety: The ſtream of elegant feſtivity will never overflow it's banks; the delicacy of ſex, the dignity of rank and the decorum of certain profeſſions ſhould never be ſo overlooked, as to alarm the feelings of any perſon preſent, intereſted for their preſervation. When the ſofter ſex entruſt themſelves to our ſociety, we ſhould never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the tender reſpect due to them even in our gayeſt hours: When the higher orders by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, and the lower by aſcending out of their ſphere meet upon the level of good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, let not our ſuperiors be revolted by a ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city however jovial, nor driven back into their faſtneſſes by our overſtepping the partition line, and making ſaucy inroads into their proper quarters. Who queſtions a miniſter about news or politics? who talks ribaldry before a biſhop?
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0600700105:236"/>
once in ſeven years is often enough for the levelling familiarity of electioneering manners.</p>
            <p>There is another remark, which I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe myſelf from making, if it were only for the ſake of thoſe luckleſs beings, who being born with duller faculties, or ſtampt by the hand of nature with oddities either of humour, or of perſon, ſeem to be ſet up in ſociety as butts for the arrows of raillery and ridicule: If the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, thus made the victim of the company, feels the ſhaft, who but muſt ſuffer with him? If he feels it not, we bluſh for human nature, whoſe dignity is ſacrificed in his perſon; and as for the profeſt buffoon, I take him to have as little pretenſions to true humour, as a punſter has to true wit. There is ſcope enough for all the eccentricities of character without turning cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into ſport; let ſatire take it's ſhare, but let vice only ſhrink before it; let it ſilence the tongue that wantonly violates truth, or defames reputation; let it batter the inſulting towers of pride, but let the air-built caſtles of vanity, much more the humble roof of the indigent and infirm never provoke it's ſpleen.</p>
            <p>It happened to me not long ago to fall into company with ſome very reſpectable perſons, chiefly of the mercantile order, where a country
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0600700105:237"/>
gentleman, who was a ſtranger to moſt of the party, took upon him to entertain the company, with a tedious ſtring of ſtories of no ſort of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to any ſoul preſent, and all tending to diſplay his own conſequence, fortune and independance. Such converſation was ill calculated for the company preſent, the majority of whom had I dare ſay been the founders of their own fortunes, and I ſhould doubt if there was any quarter of the globe acceſſible to commerce, which had not been reſorted to by ſome one or other then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the table. This unintereſting egotiſt therefore was the more unpardonable, as he ſhut out every topic of curious and amuſing informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which could no where meet a happier op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>He was endured for a conſiderable time with that patience which is natural to men of good manners and experience in the world: This encouragement only rendered him more inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; when at laſt an elderly gentleman ſeized the opportunity of a ſhort pauſe in his diſcourſe to addreſs the following reproof to this eternal talker.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"We have liſtened to you, ſir, a long time with attention, and it does not appear that any body preſent is diſpoſed to queſtion either

            <p>IN all ages of the world men have been in habits of praiſing the time paſt at the expence of the time preſent. This was done even in the Auguſtan aera, and in that witty and celebrated period the <hi>laudator temporis acti</hi> muſt have been either a very ſplenetic, or a very ſilly charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Our preſent grumblers may perhaps be better warranted; but, though there may not be the ſame injuſtice in their cavilling complaints, there is more than equal impolicy in them; for if by diſcouraging their contemporaries they mean to mend them, they take a very certain method of counteracting their own deſigns; and if they have any other meaning, it muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe than impolitic and they have more to anſwer for than a mere miſtake.</p>
            <p>Who but the meaneſt of mankind would wiſh to damp the ſpirit and degrade the genius of the country he belongs to? Is any man lowered by the dignity of his own nation, by the talents
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0600700105:240"/>
of his contemporaries? Who would not prefer to live in an enlightened and a riſing age rather than in a dark and declining one? It is natural to take a pride in the excellence of our free conſtitution, in the virtues of our Sovereign; is it not as natural to ſympathize in the proſperity of our arts and ſciences, in the reputation of our countrymen? But theſe ſplenetic <hi>Dampers</hi> are for ever ſighing over the decline of wit, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of genius, the decline of literature, when if there is any one thing that has declined rather than another, it is the wretched ſtate of criticiſm, ſo far as they have to do with it.</p>
            <p>As I was paſſing from the city the other day I turned into a coffee-houſe, and took my ſeat at a table, next to which ſome gentlemen had aſſembled, and were converſing over their coffee. A diſpute was carried on between a little prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling volatile fellow and an old gentleman of a ſullen, moroſe aſpect, who in a dictatorial tone of voice was declaiming againſt the times, and treating them and their puiſny advocate with more contempt than either one or the other ſeemed to deſerve: Still the little fellow, who had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of zeal and no want of words, kept bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling with might and main for the world as it goes againſt the world as it had gone by, and I

could perceive he had an intereſt with the junior part of his hearers, whilſt the ſullen orator was no leſs popular amongſt the elders of the party: The little fellow, who ſeemed to think it no good reaſon why any work ſhould be decried only becauſe the author of it was living, had been deſcanting upon the merit of a recent pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, and had now ſhifted his ground from the ſciences to the fine arts, where he ſeemed to have taken a ſtrong poſt and ſtood reſolutely to it; his opponent, who was not a man to be tickled out of his ſpleen by a few fine daſhes of arts merely elegant, did not reliſh this kind of ſkirmiſhing argument, and tauntingly cried out—<q rend="inline">"What tell you me of a parcel of gew-gaw ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, fit only to pick the pockets of a diſſipated trifling age? You talk of your painters and pourtrait-mongers, what uſe are they of? Where are the philoſophers and the poets, whoſe countenances might intereſt poſterity to ſit to them? Will they paint me a Bacon, a Newton or a Locke? I defy them: There are not three heads upon living ſhoulders in the kingdom worth the oil, that would be waſted upon them. Will they or you find me a Shakeſpear, a Milton, a Dryden, a Pope, an Addiſon? You cannot find a limb, a

               <q rend="inline">"I believe not,"</q>
he replied, <q rend="inline">"I believe not: I could give you a ſcore of names more, but thoſe are enough: Honeſt Tom Durfey would be more than a match for any poetaſter now breathing."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſtile he went on crowing and clapping his wings over a beaten cock, for our poor little champion ſeemed dead upon the pit: He mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſomething between his teeth, as if ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling to pronounce ſome name that ſtuck in his throat; but either there was in fact no contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, whom he thought it ſafe to oppoſe to theſe Goliahs in the liſts, or none were preſent to his mind at this moment.</p>
            <p>Alas! thought I, your cauſe, my beloved contemporaries, is deſperate: <hi>Vae Victis!</hi> You are but duſt in the ſcale, while this <hi>Brennus</hi>

All that I have admired and applauded in my zeal for thoſe with whom I have lived and ſtill live; all that has hitherto made my heart expand with pride and reverence for the age and nation I belong to, will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated to the manes of theſe departed worthies, whom, though I revere, I cannot love and cheriſh with that ſympathy of ſoul, which I feel towards you, my dear but degenerate contemporaries!</p>
            <p>There was a young man, ſitting at the elbow of the little creſt-fallen fellow, with a round clerical curl, which tokened him to be a ſon of the church. Having ſilently awaited the full time for a rally, if any ſpirit of reſurrection had been left in the fallen hero, and none ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, he addreſſed himſelf to the challenger with an air ſo modeſt, but withal ſo impreſſive, that it was impoſſible not to be prejudiced in his favour, before he opened his cauſe.</p>

               <q rend="inline">"I cannot wonder,"</q> ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">"if the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who has challenged us to produce a parallel to any one of the great names he has enumerated, finds us unprepared with any living rival to thoſe illuſtrious characters: Their fame, though the age in which they lived did not always appreciate it as it ought, hath yet been riſing day by day in the eſteem

The preſent race of philoſophers can only be conſidered as his diſciples; but they are diſciples, who do honour to their maſter: If the principle of gravitation be the grand <hi>deſideratum</hi> of philoſophy, the diſcovery is with him, the application, inferences and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of that diſcovery are with thoſe, who ſucceed him; and can we accuſe the preſent age of being idle or unable to avail themſelves of the ground he gave them? Let me remind you that our preſent ſolar ſyſtem is furniſhed with more planets than Newton knew; that our late obſervations upon the tranſit of the planet Venus were deciſive for the proof and confirmation of his ſyſtem; that

            <p>THE ſarcaſtic ſpeech of the old Snarler, with which we concluded the laſt paper, being undeſerved on the part of the perſon, to whom it

was applied, was very properly diſregarded; and the clergyman proceeded as follows:—</p>

               <q rend="inline">"The poets you have named will never be mentioned by me but with a degree of enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, which I ſhould rather expect to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of carrying to exceſs than of erring in the oppoſite extreme, had you not put me on my guard againſt partiality by charging me with it beforehand. I ſhall therefore without further apology or preface begin with Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear, firſt named by you and firſt in fame as well as time: It would be madneſs in me to think of bringing any poet now living into competition with Shakeſpear; but I hope it will not be thought madneſs, or any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling it, to obſerve to you, that it is not in the nature of things poſſible for any poet to appear in an age ſo poliſhed as this of our's, who can be brought into any critical compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with that extraordinary and eccentric genius."</q>

               <q rend="inline">"For let us conſider the two great ſtriking features of his drama, ſublimity and character, Now ſublimity involves ſentiment and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the firſt of theſe is in the ſoul of the poet; it is that portion of inſpiration, which we perſonify when we call it <hi>the Muſe</hi>; ſo

far I am free to acknowledge there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reaſon to be given, why her viſits ſhould be confined to any age, nation or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſhe may fire the heart of the poet on the ſhores of Ionia three thouſand years ago, or on the banks of the Cam or Iſis at the preſent moment; but ſo far as language is concerned, I may venture to ſay that modern diction will never ſtrike modern ears with that awful kind of magic, which antiquity gives to words and phraſes no longer in familiar uſe: In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect our great dramatic poet hath an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over his diſtant deſcendants, which he owes to time, and which of courſe is one more than he is indebted for to his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent genius. As for character, which I ſuggeſted as one of the two moſt ſtriking fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Shakeſpear's drama, (or in other words the true and perfect delineation of nature), in this our poet is indeed a maſter unrivalled; yet who will not allow the happy coincidence of time for this perfection in a writer of the drama? The different orders of men, which Shakeſpear ſaw and copied, are in many inſtances extinct, and ſuch muſt have the charms of novelty at leaſt in our eyes: And has the modern dramatiſt the ſame rich

and various field of character? The level manners of a poliſhed age furniſh little choice to an author, who now enters on the taſk, in which ſuch numbers have gone before him, and ſo exhauſted the materials, that it is juſtly to be wondered at, when any thing like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety can be ſtruck out. Dramatic characters are pourtraits drawn from nature, and if all the ſitters have a family likeneſs, the artiſt muſt either depart from the truth, or preſerve the reſemblance; in like manner the poet muſt either invent characters of which there is no counterpart in exiſtence, or expoſe himſelf to the danger of an inſipid and tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome repetition: To add to his difficulties it ſo happens, that the preſent age, whilſt it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes leſs variety to his choice, requires more than ever for it's own amuſement; the dignity of the ſtage muſt of courſe be proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to the unnatural reſources of a wild imagination, and it's propriety diſturbed; muſic will ſupply thoſe reſources for a time, and accordingly we find the French and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh theatres in the dearth of character feeding upon the airy diet of ſound; but this, with all the ſupport that ſpectacle can give, is but a flimſy

How many of theſe plays, if acted as they were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally written, would now be permitted to paſs? Can we have a ſtronger proof of the barbarous taſte of thoſe times, in which Titus Andronicus firſt appeared, than the favour, which that horrid ſpectacle was received with? yet of this we are aſſured by Ben Johnſon.

                  <head>TO THE OBSERVER.</head>
                  <p>I have been reſolving to write to thee every morning for theſe two months, but ſomething or other has always come athwart my reſolution to put it by. In the firſt place I ſhould have told thee that aunt Gertrude was taken grievouſly ſick, and had a mighty deſire to ſee thee upon affairs of conſequence; but as I was in daily hopes ſhe would mend and be able to write to thee herſelf, (for every body you know under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands their own buſineſs beſt) I thought I would wait till ſhe got well enough to tell her own ſtory; but alas! ſhe dwindled and dwindled away till ſhe died; ſo, if ſhe had any ſecrets, they are
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0600700105:260"/>
buried with her, and there's and end of that matter.</p>
                  <p>Another thing I would fain have written to thee about was to enquire into the character of a fellow, one John Jenkyns, who had ſerved a friend of thine, Sir Theodore Thimble, as his houſe ſteward, and offered himſelf to me in the ſame capacity: But this was only my own affair do you ſee, ſo I put it by from day to day, and in the mean time took the raſcal upon his word without a character: But if he ever had one, he would have loſt it in my ſervice, for he plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me without mercy, and at laſt made off with a pretty round ſum of my money, which I have never been able to get any wind of, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly becauſe I never took the trouble to make any enquiry.</p>
                  <p>I now ſit down to let you know ſon Tom is come from Oxford, and a ſtrapping fine fellow he is grown of his age: He has a mighty long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſet out upon his travels to foreign parts, which you muſt know ſeems to me a very fooliſh conceit in a young lad, who has only kept his firſt term and not completed his nineteenth year; ſo I oppoſed his whim manfully, which I think you will approve of, for I recollected the opinion you gave upon this ſubject when laſt here, and quoted
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0600700105:261"/>
it againſt him: To do him juſtice he fairly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be ruled by your advice, and willed me to write to you on the matter; but one thing or other always ſtood in the way, and in the mean time came lord Ramble in his way to Dover, and being a great crony of Tom's and very eager for his company, and no letter coming from you (which indeed I acquit you of, not having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to you on the ſubject) away the youngſters went together, and probably before this are upon French ground. Pray tell me what you think of this trip, which appears to me but a wild-gooſe kind of a chace, and if I live till to-morrow I intend to write Tom a piece of my mind to that purpoſe, and give him a few wholeſome hints, which I had put together for our parting, but had not time juſt then to communicate to him.</p>
                  <p>I intend very ſhortly to bruſh up your quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in town, as my ſolicitor writes me word every thing is at a ſtand for want of my appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: What dilatory doings muſt we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who have to do with the law! putting off from month to month and year to year: I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men of buſineſs are not aſhamed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as for me, I ſhould have been up and amongſt them long enough ago, if it had not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0600700105:262"/>
been for one thing or another that hampered me about my journey: Horſes are for ever falling lame, and farriers are ſuch lazy raſcals, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one can be cured, another cries out; and now I am in daily expectation of my favourite brood-mare dropping a foal, which I am in great hopes will prove a colt, and therefore I cannot be abſent at the time, for a maſter's eye you know is every thing in thoſe caſes: Beſides I ſhould be ſorry to come up in this dripping ſeaſon, and as the parſon has begun praying for fair weather, I hope it will ſet in ere long in good earneſt, and that it will pleaſe God to make it pleaſant tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling.</p>
                  <p>You will be pleaſed to hear that I mean ſoon to make a job of draining the marſh in front of my houſe: Every body allows that as ſoon as there is a channel cut to the river, it will be as dry as a bowling-green and as fine meadow land as any on my eſtate: It will alſo add conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably to the health as well as beauty of our ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, for at preſent 'tis a grievous eye-ſore, and fills us with fogs and foul air at ſuch a rate, that I have had my whole family down with the ague all this ſpring: Here is a fellow ready to undertake the job at a very eaſy expence and will complete it in a week, ſo that it will ſoon be
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0600700105:263"/>
done when once begun; therefore you ſee I need not hurry myſelf for ſetting about it, but wait till leiſure and opportunity ſuit.</p>
                  <p>I am ſorry I can ſend you no better news of your old friend the vicar; he is ſadly out of ſorts: You muſt know the incumbent of <hi>Slow-in-the-Wilds</hi> died ſome time ago, and as the living lies ſo handy to my own pariſh I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways intended it for our friend, and had promiſed him again and again: When behold! time ſlipt away unperceived, and in came my lord biſhop of the dioceſe with a parſon of his own, ready cut and dried, and claimed it as a lapſed living, when it has been mine and my anceſtors any time theſe five hundred years for aught I know: If theſe are not nimble doings I know not what are: Egad! a man need have all his eyes about him, that has to do with theſe biſhops. If I had been aware of ſuch a trick being played me, I would have hoiſted the honeſt vicar into the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit before the old parſon, who is dead and gone, had been nailed in his coffin; for no man loves leſs to be taken napping (as they call it) than I do; and as for the poor vicar 'tis ſurprizing to ſee how he takes to heart the diſappointment; whereas I tell him he has nothing for it but to outlive the young fellow, who has jumped into
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0600700105:264"/>
his ſhoes, and then let us ſee if any biſhop ſhall jockey us with the like jade's trick for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>I have now only to requeſt you will ſend me down a new almanack, for the year wears out apace, and I am terribly puzzled for want of knowing how it goes, and I love to be regular. If there is any thing I can do for you in theſe parts, pray employ me, for I flatter myſelf you believe no man living would go further, or more readily fly to do you ſervice than your's to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</p>

            <p>If all the reſolutions, promiſes and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of To-day, that lie over for To-morrow,

were to be ſummed up and poſted by items, what a cumbrous load of procraſtinations would be transferred in the midnight criſis of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Something perhaps like the following might be the outline of the deed, by which To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day might will and deviſe the aforeſaid contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies to its heir and ſucceſſor.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Conſcious that my exiſtence is drawing to its cloſe, I hereby deviſe and make over to my natural heir and ſucceſſor all my right and title in thoſe many vows, promiſes and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have been ſo liberally made to me by ſundry perſons in my life time, but which ſtill remain unfulfilled on their part, and ſtand out againſt them: But at the ſame time that I am heartily deſirous all engagements, fair and lawful in their nature, may be punctually complied with, I do moſt willingly cancel all ſuch as are of a contrary deſcription; hereby releaſing and diſcharging all manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who have bound themſelves to me under raſh and inconſiderate reſolutions, from the performance of which evil might enſue to themſelves, and wrong or violence be done to ſociety.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place I deſire my ſaid heir and ſucceſſor will call in all thoſe debts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0600700105:266"/>
which have been incurred by, and are due from, certain defaulters, who ſtand pledged to repentance and atonement, of all which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate payment ought in juſtice and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be rigorouſly exacted from the ſeveral parties, foraſmuch as every hour, by which they outrun their debt, weakens their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>It is my further will and deſire, that all thoſe free livers and profeſt voluptuaries, who have waſted the hours of my exiſtence in riot and debauchery, may be made to pay down their lawful quota of ſick ſtomachs and aching heads, to be levied upon them ſeverally by poll at the diſcretion of my heir and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.</p>
               <p>Whereas I am apprized of many dark deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and malicious deſigns now in actual exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to the great annoyance of ſociety and good-fellowſhip, I earneſtly recommend the detection of all ſuch evil-minded perſons with To-morrow's light, heartily hoping they will meet their due ſhame, puniſhment and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: And I ſincerely wiſh that every honeſt man, who hath this night gone to reſt with a good reputation, may not be deprived of To-morrow's repoſe by any baſe efforts,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0600700105:267"/>
which Slander, who works in the dark, may conjure up to take it from him.</p>
               <p>It is with ſingular ſatisfaction I have been made privy to ſundry kind and charitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolences, that have been privately beſtowed upon the indigent and diſtreſt, without any oſtentation or parade on the part of the givers, and I do thereupon ſtrictly enjoin and require a fair and impartial account to be taken of the ſame by my lawful heir and ſucceſſor, (be the amount what it may) that intereſt for the ſame may be put into immediate courſe of payment; whereby the parties ſo intitled may enjoy, as in juſtice they ought to do, all thoſe comforts, bleſſings and rewards, which talents ſo employed are calculated to produce.</p>
               <p>All promiſes made by men of power to their dependants, and all verbal engagements to tradeſmen on the ſcore of bills, that lie over for To-morrow, I hereby cancel and acquit; well aſſured they were not meant by thoſe, who made them, nor expected by any, who received them, then to be made good and fulfilled.</p>

            <p>IT is wonderful to me that any man will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render himſelf to be the ſlave of peeviſh and iraſcible humours, that annoy his peace, impair his health and hurt his reputation.

            <p>
               <hi>Tom Tinder</hi> is one of theſe touchy blockheads, whom no body can endure: The fellow has not a ſingle plea in life for his ill temper; he does not want money, is not married, has a great deal of health to ſpare and never once felt the ſlighteſt twinge of the gout. His eyes no ſooner open to the morning light than he begins to quarrel with the weather; it rains, and he wanted to ride; it is ſunſhine, and he meant to go a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he would hunt only when it is a froſt, and never thinks of ſkaiting but in open weather; in ſhort the wind is never in the right quarter with this teſty fellow; and though I could excuſe a man for being a little out of humour with an eaſterly wind, Tom Tinder ſhall box the whole compaſs, and never ſet his needle to a ſingle point of good humour upon the face of it.</p>
            <p>He now rings his bell for his ſervant to begin the operation of dreſſing him, a taſk more tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh than to wait upon the toilette of a monkey: As Tom ſhifts his ſervants about as regularly as he does his ſhirt, 'tis all the world to nothing if
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0600700105:270"/>
the poor devil does not ſtumble at ſtarting; or if by happy inſpiration he ſhould begin with the right foot foremoſt, Tom has another inſpiration ready at command to quarrel with him for not ſetting forward with the left: To a certainty then the razor wants ſtrapping, the ſhaving water is ſmoaked, and the devil's in the fellow for a dunce, booby and blockhead.</p>
            <p>Tom now comes down to breakfaſt, and though the ſavage has the ſtomach of an oſtrich, there is not a morſel paſſes down his blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throat without a damn to digeſt it; 'twould be a leſs dangerous taſk to ſerve in the morning meſs to a faſting bear. He then walks forth into his garden; there he does not meet a plant, which his ill-humour does not engraft with the bitter fruit of curſing; the waſps have pierced his nectarines; the caterpillars have raiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions upon his cabbages, and the infernal blackbirds have eaten up all his cherries: Tom's ſoul is not large enough to allow the denizens of creation a taſte of Nature's gifts, though he ſurfeits with the ſuperabundance of her bounty.</p>
            <p>He next takes a turn about his farm; there vexation upon vexation croſſes him at every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The fly, a plague upon't, has got amongſt
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0600700105:271"/>
his turnips; the ſmut has ſeized his wheat and his ſheep are falling down with the rot: All this is the fault of his bailiff, and at his door the blame lies with a proportionable quantity of bleſſings to recommend it. He finds a few dry ſticks pickt out of his hedges, and he blaſts all the poor in his neighbourhood for a ſet of thieves, pilferers and vagabonds. He meets one of his tenants by the way, and he has a petition for a new gate to his farm-yard, or ſome repairs to his dove-houſe, or it may be a new threſhing-floor to his barn—Hell and fury! there is no end to the demands of theſe curſed farmers—His ſtomach riſes at the requeſt, and he turns aſide ſpeechleſs with rage, and in this humour pays a viſit to his maſons and carpenters, who are at work upon a building he is adding to his offices: Here his choler inſtead of ſubſiding only flames more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, for the idle raſcals have done nothing; ſome have been making holiday, others have gone to the fair at the next town, and the maſter workman has fallen from the ſcaffold, and keeps his bed with the bruiſes: Every devil is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured up from the bottomleſs pit to come on earth and confound theſe dilatory miſcreants; and now let him go to his dinner with what ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach he may. If an humble parſon or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0600700105:272"/>
couſin expects a peaceful meal at his table, he may as well ſit down to feed with Thyeſtes or the Centaurs. After a meal of miſery and a glaſs of wine, which ten to one but the infernal butler has clouded in the decanting, he is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to a game at back-gammon: The parſon throws ſize-ace, and in a few more caſts covers all his points; the devil's in the dice! Tom makes a blot, and the parſon hits it; he takes up man after man, all his points are full and Tom is gammoned paſt redemption—Can fleſh and blood bear this? Was ever ſuch a run of luck? The dice-box is ſlapt down with a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; the tables ring with the deafening craſh, the parſon ſtands aghaſt, and Tom ſtamps the floor in the phrenzy of paſſion—Deſpicable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! miſerable dependant!—</p>
            <p>Where is his next reſource? the parſon has fled the pit; the back-gammon table is cloſed; no chearful neighbour knocks at his unſocial gate; ſilence and night and ſolitude are his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy inmates; his boiling boſom labours like a turbid ſea after the winds are lulled; ſhame ſtares him in the face; conſcience plucks at his heart, and to divert his own tormenting thoughts, he calls in thoſe of another perſon, no matter whom—the firſt idle author that ſtands next to his
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0600700105:273"/>
hand: he takes up a book; 'tis a volume of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; he opens it at random; 'tis all alike to him where he begins; all our poets put together are not worth a halter; he ſtumbles by mere chance upon <hi>The Choleric Man</hi>; 'twas one to a thouſand he ſhould ſtrike upon that blaſted play—What an infernal title! What execrable non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe! What a canting, preaching puppy of an author!—Away goes the poet with his play and half a dozen better poets than himſelf bound up in the ſame luckleſs volume, the innocent ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for his offence.</p>
            <p>Tom now ſits forlorn, diſguſted, without a friend living or dead to chear him, gnawing his own heart for want of other diet to feed his ſpleen upon: At length he ſlinks into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs bed; damns his ſervant as he draws the curtains round him, drops aſleep and dreams of the devil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Major Manlove</hi> is a near neighbour, but no intimate of Tom Tinder's: With the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that reſult from health, the major is but rarely bleſt, for a body-wound, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in battle, is apt upon certain changes of the climate to viſit him with acute pains. He is married to one of the beſt of women; but ſhe too has impaired her health by nurſing him
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0600700105:274"/>
when he was wounded, and is ſubject to ſevere rheumatic attacks. Love however has an opiate for all her pains, and domeſtic peace pours a balſam into the huſband's wound. It is only by the ſcrutinizing eye of affection, that either can diſcover when the other ſuffers, for religion has endued both hearts with patience, and neither will permit a complaint to eſcape, which might invite the ſympathizing friend to ſhare it's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Diſabled for ſervice, major Manlove has retired upon half-pay, and as he plundered neither the enemy's country nor his own during the war, he is not burthened with the ſuperfluities of fortune; happily for him theſe are not amongſt his regrets, and a prudent oeconomy keeps him ſtrait with the world and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
            <p>One brave youth, trained under his own eye in the ſame regiment with himſelf, is all the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring Heaven hath beſtowed upon this worthy father, and in him the hearts of the fond parents are centered; yet not ſo centered, as to ſhut them againſt the general calls of philanthropy, for in the village where they live they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and bleſſed by every creature. The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den furniſhes amuſement to Mrs. Manlove, and when the ſharp north eaſt does not blow pain
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0600700105:275"/>
into the major's wound, he is occupied with his farm: His trees, his crop, his cattle are his nurſelings, and the poor that labour in his ſervice are his children and friends. To his ſuperiors major Manlove deports himſelf with that grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſpect, that puts them in mind of their own dignity without diminiſhing his; to his inferiors he is ever kind and condeſcending: To all men he maintains a natural ſincerity with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſo expreſſive of the benevolence, glowing in his heart, that he is beloved as ſoon as known, and known as ſoon as ſeen. With a ſoul formed for ſociety, and a lively flow of ſpirits, this amiable man no ſooner enters into company, than his preſence diffuſes joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over the whole circle: Every voice bids him welcome; every hand is reached out to greet him with a cordial ſhake. He ſits down with a complacent ſmile; chimes in with the converſation as it is going, hears all, overbears none, damps nobody's jeſt, if it is harmleſs; cuts no man's ſtory, if it is only tedious, and is the very life and ſoul of the table.</p>
            <p>According to annual cuſtom I paſſed ſome days with him laſt autumn: There is a tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which tranſpires from the maſter and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of this family through every member be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing

to it; the ſervants are few, but ſo aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous in their reſpective ſtations, that you can no where be better waited on: The table is plain, but elegant, and though the major himſelf is no ſportſman, and has done carrying a gun, the kindneſs of his neighbours keeps him well ſupplied with game, and every ſort of rural luxury, that their farms and gardens can furniſh. Nothing can be more delightful than the face of the country about him, and I was charmed with his little ornamented farm in particular: The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the garden, and the abundance of it's fruits and flowers beſpeak Mrs. Manlove no common adept in that ſweet and captivating ſcience.</p>
            <p>One day as my friend and I were riding through his fields to enjoy the weſtern breeze of a fine September morning, our ears were ſaluted with the full chorus of the hounds from a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring copſe, and as we were croſſing one of the paſtures towards them, we heard two men at high words behind a thick hedge, that concealed them from our fight, and ſoon after the ſound of blows, which ſeemed to be heavily laid on, accompanied with oaths and cries, that made us puſh to the next gate with all the ſpeed we could muſter. One of the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0600700105:277"/>
combatants was lying on the ground, roaring for mercy under the cudgel of his conqueror, who was belaboring him at a furious rate: The perſon of the victor was unknown to major Manlove; the vanquiſht ſoon made him recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the rueſul features of Tom Tinder, who called upon the major by name to interpoſe and ſave him from being murdered.</p>
            <p>This was no ſooner done than the cudgeller, who was a ſturdy clown, gave us to underſtand, that he had been doing no more than every Engliſhman has a right to do, returning the loan of a blow with proper intereſt to the lender: This the proſtrate hero did not deny, but aſſerted that the raſcal had headed the hare as ſhe was breaking cover, and turned her into the wood again, by which means he had ſpoilt the day's ſport.—And did you this deſignedly? ſaid the major.—Not I, maſter, replied the countryman, as Heaven ſhall judge me! I love the ſport too well to ſpoil it wilfully: But if I was travelling along the road juſt as puſs was popping through the hedge, could I help it? am I in the fault? And ſhould this gentleman, if he be a gentleman, ride up to me as if he would have trampled me like a dog under his horſe's feet, and lay the butt of his whip upon my ſcull? I think no man can
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0600700105:278"/>
bear that; ſo I pulled him out of the ſaddle, and banged him well, and I think no good man, as you appear to be, will ſay otherwiſe than that he well deſerved it.—If this be ſo, anſwered the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, I can ſay nothing to the contrary.—How, ſir, exclaimed the ſquire, who was now upon his legs, is a raſcal like this to return blow for blow, and does major Manlove abet him in ſuch inſolence?—I am ſorry, ſir, replied the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor calmly, you ſhould put ſuch a queſtion to me; but when gentlemen loſe their temper—Sir, quoth Tom, interrupting him, I have loſt my horſe, and that's the worſe loſs of the two—'Tis what you are leaſt uſed to, replied the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, and without more words quietly trotted homewards.</p>
            <p>As we jogged along my friend began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with much pleaſantry upon this ridiculous incident, interlarding his diſcourſe every now and then with remarks of a more ſerious ſort upon the ill effects of a haſty temper, and giving me ſome traits of his neighbour's habits of life, which, though not ſo uncommon as I could wiſh, were nevertheleſs ſuch, as, when contraſted with his benevolent character, may perhaps ſerve to furniſh out no very unedifying topic for an Eſſay in <hi>The Obſerver.</hi>

            <p>IN times of very remote antiquity, when men were not ſo laviſh of their wit as they have ſince been, Poetry could not furniſh employment for more than <hi>Three Muſes</hi>; but as buſineſs grew upon their hands and departments multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, it became neceſſary to enlarge the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and a board was conſtituted conſiſting of <hi>Nine</hi> in number, who had their ſeveral preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies allotted to them, and every branch of the art poetic thenceforth had its peculiar patroneſs and ſuperintendant.</p>
            <p>As to the preciſe time when theſe three ſenior goddeſſes called in their ſix new aſſeſſors it is matter of conjecture only; but if the poet <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiod</hi> was, as we are told, the firſt, who had the honour of announcing their names and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the world, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe this was done upon the immediate opening of their new commiſſion, as they would hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0600700105:280"/>
upon their offices without appriſing all thoſe, whom it might concern, of their acceſſion.</p>
            <p>Before this period the three eldeſt ſiſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to be <hi>maids of all work</hi>; and if the work became more than they could turn their hands to, they have nobody but themſelves and their fellow deities to complain of; for had they been content to have let the world go on in its natural courſe, mere mortal poets would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have overburthened either it or them; but when Apollo himſelf (who being their preſident ſhould have had more conſideration for their eaſe) begot the poet <hi>Linus</hi> in one of his terreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial frolics, and endowed him with hereditary genius, he took a certain method to make work for the muſes: Accordingly we find the chaſte Calliope herſelf, the eldeſt of the ſiſterhood, and who ſhould have ſet a better example to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, could not hold out againſt this heavenly baſtard, but in an unguarded moment yielded her virgin honours to <hi>Linus,</hi> and produced the poet <hi>Orpheus:</hi> Such an inſtance of celeſtial inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence could not fail to ſhake the morals of the moſt demure; and even the cold goddeſs Luna caught the flame, and ſmuggled a bantling into the world, whom maliciouſly enough ſhe named <hi>Muſaeus,</hi> with a ſly deſign no doubt of laying
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0600700105:281"/>
her child at the door of the Parnaſſian nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery.</p>
            <p>Three ſuch high-blooded bards as <hi>Linus, Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Muſaeus,</hi> ſo fathered and ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, were enough to people all Greece with poets and muſicians; and in truth they were not idle in their generation, but like true patriarchs ſpread their families over all the ſhores of Ionia and the iſlands of the Archipelago: It is not therefore to be wondered at, if the three ſiſter muſes, who had enough to do to nurſe their own children and deſcendants, were diſpoſed to call in other helpmates to the taſk, and whilſt Greece was in its glory, it may well be ſuppoſed that all the nine ſiſters were fully employed in beſtowing upon every votary a portion of their attention, and anſwering every call made upon them for aid and inſpiration: Much gratitude is due to them from their favoured poets, and much hath been paid, for even to the preſent hour they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and worſhipped by the ſons of verſe, whilſt all the other deities of Olympus have either ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated their thrones, or been diſmiſſed from them with contempt; even Milton himſelf in his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred epic invokes the <hi>heavenly muſe,</hi> who inſpired Moſes <hi>on the top of Horeb or of Sinai</hi>; by which
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0600700105:282"/>
he aſcribes great antiquity as well as dignity to the character he addreſſes.</p>
            <p>The powers aſcribed to <hi>Orpheus</hi> were under the veil of fable emblems of his influence over ſavage minds, and of his wiſdom and eloquence in reclaiming them from that barbarous ſtate: Upon theſe impreſſions civilization and ſociety took place: The patriarch, who founded a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or tribe, the legiſlator, who eſtabliſhed a ſtate, the prieſt, prophet, judge or king, are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, which, if traced to their firſt ſources, will be found to branch from that of poet: The firſt prayers, the firſt laws and the earlieſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies were metrical; proſe hath a later origin, and before the art of writing was in exiſtence, poetry had reached a very high degree of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſome of it's nobleſt productions were no otherwiſe preſerved than by tradition. As to the ſacred quality of their firſt poetry the Greeks are agreed, and to give their early bards the better title to inſpiration they feign them to be deſcended from the Gods; <hi>Orpheus</hi> muſt have profited by his mother's partiality, and <hi>Linus</hi> may well be ſuppoſed to have had ſome intereſt with his father Apollo. But to dwell no longer on theſe fabulous legends of the Greeks, we may refer to the books of Moſes for the earlieſt
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0600700105:283"/>
and moſt authentic examples of ſacred poetry: Every thing that was the immediate effuſion of the prophetic ſpirit ſeems to have been chaunted. forth in dithyrambic meaſure; the valedictory bleſſings of the Patriarchs, when dying, the ſongs of triumph and thankſgiving after victory are metrical, and high as the antiquity of the ſacred poem of Job undoubtedly is, ſuch nevertheleſs is its character and conſtruction as to carry ſtrong internal marks of its being written in an advanced ſtate of the art.</p>
            <p>The poet therefore, whether Hebrew or Greek, was in the earlieſt ages a ſacred character, and his talent a divine gift, a celeſtial inſpiration: Men regarded him as the ambaſſador of Heaven and the interpreter of it's will. It is perfectly in nature and no leſs agreeable to God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſuppoſe that even in the darkeſt times ſome minds of a more enlightened ſort ſhould break forth, and be engaged in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the univerſe and its author: From medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating upon the works of the Creator the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the act of praiſe and adoration follows as it were of courſe: Theſe are operations of the mind, which naturally inſpire it with a certain portion of rapture and enthuſiaſm, ruſhing upon the lips in warm and glowing language, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0600700105:284"/>
to be expreſſed in ordinary and vulgar phraſe; the thoughts become inflated, the breaſt labours with a paſſionate deſire to ſay ſomething worthy of the ear of Heaven, ſomething in a more elevated tone and cadence, ſomething more harmonious and muſical; this can only be effected by meaſured periods, by ſome chaunt, that can be repeated in the ſtrain again and again, grateful at once to the ear and impreſſive on the memory; and what is this but poetry? Poetry then is the language of prayer, an addreſs becoming of the Deity; it may be remembered; it may be repeated in the ears of the people called together for the purpoſes of worſhip; this is a form that may be fixt upon their minds and in this they may be taught to join.</p>
            <p>The next ſtep in the progreſs of poetry from the praiſe of God is to the praiſe of men: Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious characters, heroic actions are ſingled out for celebration; the inventors of uſeful arts, the reformers of ſavage countries, the benefactors of mankind are extolled in verſe, they are raiſed to the ſkies, and the poet, having praiſed them as the firſt of men, whilſt on earth, deifies them after death, and, conſcious that they merit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, boldly beſtows it, and aſſigns to them a rank and office in heaven appropriate to the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0600700105:285"/>
character they maintained in life; hence it is that the merits of a Bacchus, a Hercules and numbers more are amplified by the poet, till they become the attributes of their divinity, altars are raiſed and victims immolated to their worſhip. Theſe are the fanciful effects of poetry in its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſtage: Religion over-heated turns into enthuſiaſm; enthuſiaſm forces the imagination into all the viſionary regions of fable, and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try takes poſſeſſion of the whole Gentile world. The Egyptians, a myſterious dogmatizing race, begin the work with ſymbol and hieroglyphic; the Greeks, a vain ingenious people, invent a ſet of tales and fables for what they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, embelliſh them with all the glittering ornaments of poetry, and ſpread the captivating deluſion over all the world.</p>
            <p>In the ſucceeding period we review the poet in full poſſeſſion of this brilliant machinery and with all Olympus at his command: Surrounded by Apollo and the muſes he commences every poem with an addreſs to them for protection: He has a deity at his call for every operation of nature; if he would roll the thunder, Jupiter ſhakes Mount Ida to dignify his deſcription; Neptune attends him in his car, if he would allay the ocean; if he would let looſe the winds to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0600700105:286"/>
raiſe it Aeolus unbars his cave; the ſpear of Mars and the aegis of Minerva arm him for the battle; the arrows of Apollo ſcatter peſtilence through the air; Mercury flies upon the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Jupiter; Juno raves with jealouſy and Venus leads the Loves and Graces in her train. In this claſs we contemplate <hi>Homer</hi> and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior brethren of the epic order; it is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to form the warrior, inſtruct the politician, animate the patriot; they delineate the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and manners; they charm us with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, ſurprize us with their incidents, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt us with their dialogue; they engage every paſſion in its turn, melt us to pity, rouſe us to glory, ſtrike us with terror, fire us with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in a word they prepare us for the drama, and the drama for us.</p>
            <p>A new poet now comes upon the ſtage; he ſtands in perſon before us: He no longer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as a blind and wandering bard chaunting his rhapſodies to a throng of villagers collected in a group about him, but erects a ſplendid the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, gathers together a whole city as his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, prepares a ſtriking ſpectacle, provides a chorus of actors, brings muſic, dance and dreſs to his aid, realizes the thunder, burſts open the tombs of the dead, calls forth their apparitions,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0600700105:287"/>
deſcends to the very regions of the damned and drags the Furies from their flames to preſent themſelves perſonally to the terrified ſpectators: Such are the powers of the drama; here the poet reigns and triumphs in his higheſt glory.</p>
            <p>The fifth denomination gives us the lyric poet chaunting his ode at the public games and feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, crowned with olive and encompaſſed by all the wits and nobles of his age and country: Here we contemplate <hi>Steſichorus, Alcaeus, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, Calliſtratus</hi>; ſublime, abrupt, impetuous they ſtrike us with the ſhock of their electric ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; they dart from earth to heaven; there is no following them in their flights; we ſtand gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſurprize, their boldneſs awes us, their brevity confounds us; their ſudden tranſitions and ellipſes eſcape our apprehenſion; we are charmed we know not why, we are pleaſed with being puzzled and applaud although we cannot comprehend. In the lighter lyric we meet <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creon, Sappho,</hi> and the votaries of Bacchus and Venus; in the grave, didactic, ſolemn claſs we have the venerable names of a <hi>Solon,</hi> a <hi>Tyrtaeus</hi> and thoſe, who may be ſtiled the demagogues in poetry: Is liberty to be aſſerted, licentiouſneſs to be repreſſed? Is the ſpirit of a nation to be rouſed? It is the poet not the orator muſt give
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0600700105:288"/>
the ſoul its energy and ſpring: Is Salamis to be recovered? It is the elegy of <hi>Solon</hi> muſt found the march to it's attack. Are the Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be awakened from their lethargy? It is <hi>Tyrtaeus,</hi> who muſt ſing the war-ſong and revive their languid courage.</p>
            <p>Poetry next appears in its paſtoral character; it affects the garb of ſhepherds and the language of the ruſtic: It repreſents to our view the rural landſcape and the peaceful cottage; it records the labours, the amuſements, the loves of the village nymphs and ſwains, and exhibits nature in its ſimpleſt ſtate: It is no longer the harp or the lyre, but the pipe of the poet, which now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites our attention: <hi>Theocritus,</hi> leaning on his crook in his ruſſet mantle and <hi>clouted brogues,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more perfectly in character than the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Maro,</hi> who ſeems more the ſhepherd of the theatre than of the field. I have yet one other claſs in reſerve for the epigrammatiſt, but I will ſhut up my liſt without him, not being willing that poetry, which commences with a prayer, ſhould conclude with a pun.</p>

            <p>WE have heard ſo much of the tragical ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of jealouſy, that I was not a little pleaſed with an account lately given me of a gentleman, who has been happily cured of his jealouſy without any of thoſe melancholy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which too frequently reſult from that fatal paſſion, even when it is groundleſs: As this gentleman's jealouſy was of that deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am the rather tempted to relate the ſtory (under proper caution as to names and perſons) becauſe there is a moral juſtice in its cataſtrophe, which is pleaſing even in fiction, but more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſo when we meet it in the real occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of life.</p>
            <p>Sir Paul Teſty in his forty-eighth year mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the beautiful Louiſa in her eighteenth; there are ſome parents, who ſeem to think a good ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement can atone for any diſparity of age, and Louiſa's were of this ſort. Sir Paul had a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſiſter ſeveral years younger than himſelf, who had kept his houſe for ſome time before his marriage with Louiſa, and as this lady was in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0600700105:290"/>
fact an admirable oeconomiſt and alſo in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a very conſiderable independent fortune, the prudent baronet took his meaſures for her continuance in his family, where under pretence of aſſiſting the inexperience of his young bride ſhe ſtill maintained her government in as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute authority as ever: As Miſs Rachel would have been better pleaſed with her brother, had he choſen a wife with leſs beauty and more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune than Louiſa brought into the family, it may well be doubted if ſhe would have remained with him after his marriage, had ſhe not been pretty far advanced in an affair of the heart with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain young gentleman, whoſe attentions, though in fact directed to her purſe, ſhe was willing to believe had been honourably addreſſed to her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: This young gentleman, whom I ſhall call Lionel, was undoubtedly an object well deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the regards of any lady in Miſs Rachel's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament; with a fine perſon and engaging ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs he had the recommendation of high birth, being a younger ſon of the Lord Mortimer, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable old peer, who reſided at his family man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion within a few miles of Sir Paul, and lived upon the moſt friendly terms with him in a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent intercourſe of viſits: Lionel had given this worthy father great uneaſineſs from his early
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0600700105:291"/>
diſſipation and extravagance; conſiderable ſums had been paid for him to clear his debts, but the old lord's eſtate being a moderate one and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon his eldeſt ſon, Lionel had been obliged to ſell out of the army, and was now living at home upon the bounty of his father on a reduced and ſlender allowance.</p>
            <p>It is not to be wondered at that Lionel, who felt his own embaraſſments too ſenſibly to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect any fair means of getting rid of them, ſhould be willing to repair his ſhattered fortunes by an advantageous match; and though Miſs Rachel was not exactly the lady he would have choſen, yet he very juſtly conſidered that his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances did not entitle him to chuſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he was alſo ſtrongly urged to the meaſure by his father, to whoſe wiſhes he held himſelf bound to conform not only on the ſcore of duty but of atonement likewiſe: At this time the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair was in ſo promiſing a train, that there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doubt but it would have been brought to a concluſion between the parties, had not Sir Paul's marriage taken place as it did; but as Miſs Rachel for reaſons, which are ſufficiently explained, determined upon remaining with her brother, the intercourſe between the lovers was renewed, as ſoon as Sir Peter had brought home
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0600700105:292"/>
his bride, and was ſufficiently ſettled to receive the viſits of his friends and neighbours on the occaſion.</p>
            <p>Now it was that the unhappy Rachel became a victim to the moſt tormenting of all human paſſions: her ſiſter-in-law had a thouſand charms, and ſhe ſoon diſcovered, or fancied ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that Lionel's attentions were directed towards a fairer object than herſelf: She had now the ſtrongeſt of all motives for keeping a watchful eye upon Louiſa's behaviour, and it is the property of jealouſy to magnify and diſcolour every thing it looks upon; for ſome time how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe kept herſelf under prudent reſtraint; a hint now and then, cautiouſly introduced in the way of advice, was all ſhe ventured upon; but theſe hints were ſo little attended to by Louiſa, whoſe innocent gayety lent no ear to ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, that they were occaſionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in a graver tone; as theſe grew more and more peeviſh, Louiſa began to take a little miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous pleaſure in teazing, and was piqued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a behaviour, which probably ſhe would never have indulged herſelf in towards Lionel, had not Rachel's jealouſy provoked her to it; ſtill it was innocent, but ſo far imprudent, as it gave a handle to Rachel's malice, who now began to

            <p>In one of thoſe ſparring dialogues, which now frequently paſſed between the ſiſters, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, after deſcanting upon the old topic with ſome degree of aſperity, concluded her lecture with many profeſſions of zeal for Louiſa's happineſs, and obſerved to her as an apology for the freedom of her advice, that ſhe had a right to ſome little experience of the world more than had yet fallen to the other's lot: To which Louiſa replied with ſome tartneſs—<q rend="inline">"True! for you have lived more years in it than I have."—</q>

added Louiſa:

               <q rend="inline">"Be that as it may,"</q> ſaid the elder damſel,

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Be content!"</q> cried Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">"if you will give no cauſe for diſturbing the affections of the huſband, I will take care none ſhall be given for attainting the reputation of the wife."</q>
            </p>
            <p>At this moment Sir Paul entered the room, and perceiving by the countenances of the ladies, that they were not perfectly in good-humour with each other, eagerly demanded of Louiſa why ſhe looked ſo grave.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I would look grave, if I could,"</q> ſhe replied,
<q rend="inline">"out of compliment to my company; but I have ſo light a conſcience and ſo gay a heart, that I cannot look gravity in the face without laughing at it."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was delivered with ſo pointed a glance at Rachel, that it was not poſſible to miſtake the application, and ſhe had no ſooner left the room,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0600700105:295"/>
than an explanation took place between the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter, in the courſe of which Rachel artfully contrived to infuſe ſuch a copious por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her own poiſonous jealouſy into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of ſir Paul, that upon the arrival of lord Mortimer, which was at this criſis announced to him, he took a ſudden determination to give him to underſtand how neceſſary it was become to his domeſtic happineſs, that Lionel ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to diſcontinue his viſits in his family.</p>
            <p>Under theſe impreſſions and in a very awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate of mind Sir Paul repaired to his library, where lord Mortimer was expecting him in a ſituation of no leſs embaraſſment, having conned over a ſpeech for the purpoſe of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a propoſal for an alliance between the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and with a view to ſound how Sir Paul might ſtand affected towards a match between his ſon Lionel and Miſs Rachel.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the firſt ceremonies were over, which were not very ſpeedily diſmiſſed, as both parties were ſtrict obſervers of the old rules of breeding, his lordſhip began after his manner to wind about by way of reconnoitring his ground, and having compoſed his features with much gravity and deliberation, began to open his honourable trenches as follows—<q rend="inline">"In very truth, Sir Paul, I
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0600700105:296"/>
proteſt to you there are few things in life can give me more pleaſure than to find my ſon Lionel ſo aſſiduous in his viſits to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily."</q>—The baronet, whoſe mind at this moment was not capable of adverting to any other idea but what had reference to his own jealouſy, ſtared with amazement at this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected addreſs and was ſtaggered how to reply to it; at laſt with much heſitation in a tone of ill-counterfeited raillery he replied that he truly believed there was one perſon in his family, to whom Mr. Lionel's viſits were particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; and as this was a ſubject very near his heart, nay, that alone upon which the honour and happineſs of him and his family depended, he aſſured his lordſhip that it was with avidity he embraced the opportunity of coming to an explanation, which he hoped would be as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential on his lordſhip's part, as it ſhould be on his own. There was ſomething in the manner of Sir Paul's delivery, as well as in the matter of the ſpeech itſelf, which alarmed the hereditary pride of the old peer, who drawing himſelf up with great dignity obſerved to Sir Paul, that for his ſon Lionel he had this to ſay, that want of honour was never amongſt his failings; nay it was never to be charged with impunity againſt
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0600700105:297"/>
any member of his family, and that to prevent any imputation of this ſort from being grounded upon his ſon's aſſiduities to a certain lady, he had now ſought this interview and explanation with his good friend and neighbour.</p>
            <p>This was ſo kind a lift in Sir Paul's concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards his favourite point, that he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately exclaimed—<q rend="inline">"I ſee your lordſhip is not unappriſed of what is too conſpicuous to be overlooked by any body, who is familiar in this houſe; but as I know your lordſhip is a man of the niceſt honour in your own perſon, I ſhould hold myſelf eſſentially bound to you, if you would prevail upon your ſon to adopt the like principles towards a certain lady un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this roof, and caution him to deſiſt from thoſe aſſiduities, which you yourſelf have noticed, and which to confeſs the truth to you I cannot be a witneſs to without very great uneaſineſs and diſcontent."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe words the peer ſtarted from his ſeat as nimbly as age would permit him, and with great firmneſs replied—<q rend="inline">"Sir Paul Teſty, if this be your wiſh and deſire, let me aſſure you, it ſhall be mine alſo; my ſon's viſits in this family will never be repeated; ſet your
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0600700105:298"/>
heart at reſt; Lionel Mortimer will give you and your's no further diſturbance."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My lord,"</q> anſwered the baronet,
<q rend="inline">"I am penetrated with the ſenſe of your very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proceedings, and the warmth with which you have expreſſed yourſelf on a ſubject ſo cloſely interwoven with my peace of mind; you have eaſed my heart of it's burthen and I ſhall ever be moſt grateful to you for it."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> replied the peer,
<q rend="inline">"there is more than enough ſaid on the ſubject; I dare ſay my ſon will ſurvive his diſappointment."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"I dare ſay he will,"</q>
ſaid Sir Paul,
<q rend="inline">"I cannot doubt the ſucceſs of Mr. Lionel's attentions; I have only to hope he will direct them to ſome other object."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Lord Mortimer now muttered ſomething, which Sir Paul did not hear, nor perhaps attend to, and took a haſty leave. When it is explained to the reader that Miſs Rachel had never, even in the moſt diſtant manner, hinted the ſituation of her heart to her brother, on the contrary had induſtriouſly concealed it from him, this <hi>mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entendu</hi> will not appear out of nature and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Lionel, whoſe little gallantries with Louiſa had not gone far enough ſeriouſly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0600700105:299"/>
his heart, was ſufficiently tired of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary attachment to Miſs Rachel; ſo that he patiently ſubmitted to his diſmiſſion and readily obeyed his father's commands by a total diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his viſits to Sir Paul: To the ladies of the family this behaviour appeared alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether myſterious; Sir Paul kept the ſecret to himſelf, and watched Louiſa very narrowly; when he found ſhe took no other notice of Lionel's neglect, than by ſlightly remarking that ſhe ſuppoſed he was more agreeably engaged, he began to diſmiſs his jealouſy and regain his ſpirits.</p>
            <p>It was far otherwiſe with the unhappy Rachel; her heart was on the rack, for though ſhe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuſpected her brother's jealouſy of being the cauſe of Lionel's abſence, yet ſhe could not account for his ſilence towards herſelf in any other way than by ſuppoſing that Louiſa had totally drawn off his affections from her, and this was agony not to be ſupported; day after day paſſed in anxious expectation of a letter to explain this cruel neglect, but none came; all communication with the whole family of lord Mortimer was at a ſtop; no intelligence could be obtained from that quarter, and to all ſuch enquiries as ſhe ventured to try upon her brother,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0600700105:300"/>
he anſwered ſo drily, that ſhe could gather no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him: In the mean time as he became hourly better reconciled to Louiſa, ſo he grew more and more cool to the miſerable Rachel, who now too late diſcovered the fatal conſequences of interfering between huſband and wife, and heartily reproached herſelf for her officiouſneſs in aggravating his jealouſy.</p>
            <p>Whilſt ſhe was tormenting herſelf with theſe reflections, and when Louiſa ſeemed to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that ever ſuch a perſon as Lionel exiſted, a report was circulated that he was about to be married to a certain lady of great rank and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and that he had gone up with lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer to town for that purpoſe. There wanted only this blow to make Rachel's agonies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; in a ſtate of mind little ſhort of phrenſy ſhe betook herſelf to her chamber, and there ſhutting herſelf up ſhe gave vent to her paſſion in a letter fully charged with complaints and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, which ſhe committed to a truſty meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger with ſtrict injunctions to deliver it into Lionel's own hand, and return with his anſwer: This commiſſion was faithfully performed, and the following is the anſwer ſhe received in return.—</p>

henceforth one of the moſt miſerable of human beings: After venting a torrent of rage againſt her brother, ſhe turned her back upon his houſe for ever, and undetermined where to ſix, whilſt at intervals ſhe can ſcarce be ſaid to be in poſſeſſion of her ſenſes, ſhe is ſtill wandering from place to place in ſearch of that repoſe, which is not to be found, and wherever ſhe goes exhibits a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſpectacle of diſappointed envy and ſelf-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ſpleen.</p>

            <p>A Deliſa poſſeſt of beauty, fortune, rank, and every elegant accompliſhment, that genius and education could beſtow, was withal ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportably capricious, that ſhe ſeemed born to be the torment of every heart, which ſuffered itſelf to be attracted by her charms. Though her coquetry was notorious to a proverb, ſuch were her allurements, that very few, upon whom ſhe thought fit to practiſe them, had ever found reſolution to reſiſt their power. Of all the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims of her vanity Leander ſeemed to be that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0600700105:303"/>
over whom ſhe threw her chains with the greateſt air of triumph; he was indeed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to boaſt of, for he had long and obſtinately defended his heart, and for a time made as many repriſals upon the tender paſſions of her ſex as ſhe raiſed contributions upon his: Her better ſtar at length prevailed; ſhe beheld Leander at her feet, and though her victory was accompliſhed at the expence of more tender glances, than ſhe had ever beſtowed upon the whole ſex collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, yet it was a victory, which only piqued Adeliſa to render his ſlavery the more intolerable for the trouble it had coſt her to reduce him to it. After ſhe had trifled with him and tortured him in every way that her ingenious malice could deviſe, and made ſuch public diſplay of her ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, as ſubjected him to the ridicule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all the men, who had envied his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and every woman, who reſented his neglect, Adeliſa avowedly diſmiſſed him as an object which could no longer furniſh ſport to her cruelty, and turned to other purſuits with a kind of indifference as to the choice of them, which ſeemed to have no other guide but mere ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price.</p>
            <p>Leander was not wanting to himſelf in the efforts he now made to free himſelf from her
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0600700105:304"/>
chains; but it was in vain; the hand of beauty had wrapped them too cloſely about his heart, and love had rivetted them too ſecurely, for reaſon, pride or even the ſtrongeſt ſtruggles of reſentment to throw them off; he continued to love, to hate, to execrate and adore her. His firſt reſolution was to exile himſelf from her ſight; this was a meaſure of abſolute neceſſity, for he was not yet recovered enough to abide the chance of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, and he had neither ſpirits nor inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtart a freſh attachment by way of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon her jealouſy. Fortune however be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended him in the very moment of deſpair, for no ſooner was he out of her ſight, than the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettiſh Adeliſa found ſomething wanting, which had been ſo familiar to her, that Leander, though deſpiſed when poſſeſt, when loſt was regretted. In vain ſhe culled her numerous admirers for ſome one to replace him; continually peeviſh and diſcontented Adeliſa became ſo intolerable to her lovers, that there ſeemed to be a ſpirit conjuring up amongſt them, which threatened her with a general deſertion. What was to be done? Her danger was alarming, it was immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: She determined to recall Leander: She informed herſelf of his haunts, and threw herſelf in the way of a rencontre; but he avoided her:
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0600700105:305"/>
Chance brought them to an interview, and ſhe began by rallying him for his apoſtacy: There was an anxiety under all this affected pleaſantry, that ſhe could not thoroughly conceal, and he did not fail to diſcover: He inſtantly determined upon the very wiſeſt meaſure, which deliberation could have formed; he combated her with her own weapons; he put himſelf apparently ſo much at his eaſe and counterfeited his part ſo well, as effectually to deceive her: ſhe had now a new taſk upon her hands and the hardeſt as well as the moſt hazardous ſhe had ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: She attempted to throw him off his guard by a pretended pity for his paſt ſufferings and a promiſe of kinder uſage for the future: He denied that he had ſuffered any thing, and aſſured her that he never failed to be amuſed by her humours, which were perfectly agreeable to him at all times.—<q rend="inline">"Then it is plain,"</q> replied ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"that you never thought of me as a wife; for ſuch humours muſt be inſupportable to a huſband."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Pardon me,"</q> cried Leander,
<q rend="inline">"if ever I ſhould be betrayed into the idle act of marriage, I muſt be in one of thoſe very humours myſelf: Defend me from the dull uniformity of domeſtic life! What can be ſo inſipid as the tame ſtrain of nuptial har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0600700105:306"/>
everlaſtingly repeated? Whatever other varieties I may then debar myſelf of, let me at leaſt find a variety of whim in the woman I am to be fettered to."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Upon my word,"</q> exclaimed Adeliſa,
<q rend="inline">"you would almoſt perſuade me that we were deſtined for each other."</q>—This ſhe accompanied with one of thoſe looks, in which ſhe was moſt expert, and which was calculated at once to inſpire and to betray ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: Leander, not yet ſo certain of his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations as to confide in them, ſeemed to receive this ouverture as a raillery and affecting a laugh, replied—<q rend="inline">"I do not think it is in the power of deſtiny herſelf to determine either of us; for if you was for one moment in the humour to promiſe yourſelf to me, I am certain in the next you would retract it; and if I was fool enough to believe you, I ſhould well deſerve to be puniſhed for my credulity: Hymen will never yoak us to each other, nor to any body elſe; but if you are in the mind to make a very harmleſs experiment of the little faith I put in all ſuch promiſes, here is my hand; 'tis fit the propoſal ſhould ſpring from my quarter and not your's; cloſe with it as ſoon as you pleaſe, and laugh at me as much as you pleaſe, if I vent one murmur when you break the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0600700105:307"/>
bargain."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Well then,"</q> ſaid Adeliſa,
<q rend="inline">"to puniſh you for the ſaucineſs of your provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing challenge, and to convince you that I do not credit you for this pretended indifference to my treatment of you, here is my hand, and with it my promiſe; and now I give you warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if ever I do keep it, 'twill be only from the conviction that I ſhall torment you more by fulfilling it than by flying from it."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Fairly declared,"</q> cried Leander,
<q rend="inline">"and ſince my word is paſſed, I'll ſtand to it; but take notice, if I was not perfectly ſecure of being jilted, I ſhould think myſelf in a fair way to be the moſt egregious dupe in nature."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſtrain of mutual raillery they proceeded to ſettle the moſt ſerious buſineſs of their lives, and whilſt neither would venture upon a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their paſſion, each ſeemed to rely upon the other for a diſcovery of it. They now broke up their conference in the gayeſt ſpirits imaginable, and Leander upon parting offered to make a bett of half his fortune with Adeliſa that ſhe did not ſtand to her engagement, at the ſame time naming a certain day as the period of its taking place.—<q rend="inline">"And what ſhall I gain,"</q> ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"in that caſe by half your fortune, when I ſhall have a joint ſhare in poſſeſſion of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0600700105:308"/>
whole?"—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Talk not of fortune,"</q> cried Leander, giving looſe to the rapture which he could no longer reſtrain,
<q rend="inline">"my heart, my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my life itſelf is your's."</q>—So ſaying he caught her in his arms, preſſed her eagerly in his embrace, and haſtily departed.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was he out of her ſight than he began to expoſtulate with himſelf upon his indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: In the ecſtacy of one unguarded mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had blaſted all his ſchemes, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his weakneſs armed her with freſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to torment him. In theſe reflections he paſſed the remainder of the night; in vain he ſtrove to find ſome juſtification for his folly; he could not form his mind to believe that the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der looks ſhe had beſtowed upon him were any other than an experiment upon his heart to throw him from his guard and reeſtabliſh her tyranny. With theſe impreſſions he preſented himſelf at her door next morning and was immediately admitted; Adeliſa was alone, and Leander im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately began by ſaying to her—<q rend="inline">"I am now come to receive at your hands the puniſhment, which a man who cannot keep his own ſecret richly deſerves; I ſurrender myſelf to you, and I expect you will exert your utmoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in tormenting me; only remember
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0600700105:309"/>
that you cannot give a ſtab to my heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding your own image, which enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopes every part, and is too deeply impreſt for even your cruelty totally to extirpate."</q>—At the concluſion of this ſpeech, Adeliſa's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance became ſerious; ſhe fixt her eyes upon the floor and after a pauſe without taking any notice of Leander, and as if ſhe had been talking to herſelf in ſoliloquy repeated in a murmuring tone—<q rend="inline">"Well, well, 'tis all over; but no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"For the love of Heaven,"</q> cried Leander in alarm, <q rend="inline">"what is all over?"—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"All that is moſt delightful to woman,"</q>
ſhe replied;
<q rend="inline">"all the luxury, which the vanity of my ſex enjoys in tormenting your's: Oh Leander! what charming projects of revenge had I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to puniſh your pretended indifference, and depend upon it I would have executed them to the utmoſt rigour of the law of reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, had you not in one moment diſarmed me of my malice by a fair confeſſion of your love. Believe me, Leander, I never was a coquette but in ſelf-defence; ſincerity is my natural character; but how ſhould a woman of any attractions be ſafe in ſuch a character, when the whole circle of faſhion abounds with artificial coxcombs, pretenders to ſentiment
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0600700105:310"/>
and profeſſors of ſeduction? When the whole world is in arms againſt innocence, what is to become of the naked children of nature, if experience does not teach them the art of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? If I have employed this art more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly againſt you than others, why have I ſo done, but becauſe I had more to apprehend from your inſincerity than any other perſon's, and proportioned my defences to my danger? Between you and me, Leander, it has been more a conteſt of cunning than an affair of honour, and if you will call your own conduct into fair review, truſt me you will find little reaſon to complain of mine. Naturally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to favour your attentions more than any other man's, it particularly behoved me to guard myſelf againſt propenſities at once ſo pleaſing and ſo ſuſpicious. Let this ſuffice in juſtification of what is paſt; it now remains that I ſhould explain to you the ſyſtem I have laid down for the time to come: If ever I aſſume the character of a wife, I devote myſelf to all it's duties; I bid farewell at once to all the vanities, the petulancies, the coquetries of what is falſely called a life of pleaſure; the whole ſyſtem muſt undergo a revolution and be adminiſtered upon other principles and to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0600700105:311"/>
other purpoſes: I know the world too well to commit myſelf to it, when I have more than my own conſcience to account to, when I have not only truths but the ſimilitudes of truths to ſtudy; ſuſpicions, jealouſies, appearances to provide againſt; when I am no longer ſingly reſponſible on the ſcore of error, but of example alſo: It is not therefore in the public diſplay of an affluent fortune, in dreſs, equipage, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, nor even in the fame of ſplendid charities my pleaſures will be found; they will center in domeſtic occupations; in cultivating nature and the ſons of nature, in benefiting the tenants and labourers of the ſoil that ſupplies us with the means of being uſeful; in living hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily with my neighbours, in availing myſelf of thoſe numberleſs opportunities, which a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the country affords of relieving the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told diſtreſſes of thoſe, who ſuffer in ſecret, and are too humble or perhaps too proud to aſk."</q>—Here the enraptured Leander could no longer keep ſilence, but breaking forth into tranſports of love and admiration, gave a turn to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which it is no otherwiſe intereſting to relate than as it proved the prelude to an union which ſpeedily took place and has made Leander and Adeliſa the fondeſt and the worthieſt couple in England.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0600700105:312"/>From Adeliſa's example I would willingly eſtabliſh this concluſion, that the characters of young unmarried women, who are objects of admiration, are not to be decided upon by the appearances, which they are oftentimes tempted to aſſume upon the plea of ſelf-defence: I would not be underſtood by this to recommend diſguiſe in any ſhape, or to juſtify thoſe who reſort to arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon the pretended neceſſity of the meaſure; but I am thoroughly diſpoſed to believe that the triflings and diſſemblings of the young and fair do not ſo often flow from the real levity of their natures, as they are thought to do: Thoſe in particular, whoſe ſituation throws them into the vortex of the faſhion, have much that might be ſaid in palliation of appearances. Many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettes beſides Adeliſa have become admirable wives and mothers, and how very many more might have approved themſelves ſuch, had they fallen into the hands of men of worth and good ſenſe, is a conjecture, which leads to the moſt melancholy reflections. There is ſo little hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable love in the men of high life before mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and ſo much infidelity after it, that the huſband is almoſt in every inſtance the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter of his wife. A woman (as ſhe is called) of the world is in many people's notions a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed

animal; a ſilly idea prevails that ſhe is to lead a huſband into certain ruin and diſgrace: Parents in general ſeem agreed in exerting all their influence and authority for keeping her out of their families; in place of whom they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obtrude upon their ſons ſome raw and inexperienced thing, whom they figure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as a creature of perfect innocence and ſimplicity, a wife who may be modelled to the wiſhes of her huſband, whoſe manners are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted by the vices of the age, and on whoſe purity, fidelity and affection he may repoſe his happineſs for the reſt of his days. Alas! how groſsly they misjudge their own true intereſts in the caſe: How dangerous is the ſituation of theſe children of the nurſery at their firſt introduction into the world! Thoſe only who are unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the deceitfulneſs of pleaſure can be thoroughly intoxicated by it; it is the novelty which makes the danger; and ſurely it requires infinitely more judgment, ſtronger reſolutions and cloſer attentions to ſteer the conduct of a young wife without experience, than would ſerve to detach the woman of the world from frivolities ſhe is ſurfeited with, and by fixing her to your intereſts convert what you have thought a diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated character into a domeſtic one.</p>

               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0600700105:314"/>The ſame remark applies to young men of private education: you keep them in abſolute ſubjection till they marry, and then in a moment make them their own maſters; from mere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy you expect them to ſtep at once into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manhood: The motives for the experiment may be virtuous, but the effects of it will be fatal.</p>
            <p>I am now approaching to the concluſion of this my fifth volume, and according to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe ſhall diſmiſs the <hi>Obſervers</hi> from any further duty: The reader and I are here to part. A few words therefore on ſuch an occaſion I may be permitted to ſubjoin; I have done my beſt to merit his protection, and as I have been favorably heard whilſt yet talking with him, I hope I ſhall not be unkindly remembered when I can ſpeak no more: I have paſſed a life of many labours, and now being near it's end have little to boaſt but of an inherent good-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mankind, which diſappointments, injuries and age itſelf have not been able to diminiſh. It has been the chief aim of all my attempts to reconcile and endear man to man: I love my

It is however one of thoſe ſtubborn habits, which people are apt to excuſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by calling it a <hi>ſecond nature.</hi> There is a certain amiable lady in the world, in whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts I have the tendereſt concern and whoſe virtues I contemplate with paternal pride; to her I have always wiſhed to dedicate theſe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; but when I conſider that ſuch a tribute cannot add an atom to her reputation, and that no form of words, which I can invent for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, would do juſtice to what paſſes in my heart, I drop the undertaking and am ſilent.</p>
