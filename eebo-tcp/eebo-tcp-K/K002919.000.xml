            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHEN I write you, I know not to whom I am addreſſing myſelf; I only know he is one who has done me a great deal of honour, and to whoſe civilities I am obliged. If we be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I beg we may be acquainted as ſoon as you think proper to diſcover yourſelf; if we be acquainted already,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0098102600:2"/>
I beg we may be friends; if friends, I beg we may be more ſo. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with each other, as men of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is greater than our difference as adhering to different ſects or ſyſtems. Let us revive the happy times, when Atticus and Caſſius the Epicureans, Cicero the Academic, and Brutus the Stoic, could, all of them, live in unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved friendſhip, together, and were inſenſible to all thoſe diſtinctions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo far as they furniſhed agreable matter to diſcourſe and converſation. Perhaps you are a young man, and being full of thoſe ſublime ideas, which you have ſo well expreſt, think there can be no virtue upon a more confined ſyſtem. I am not an old one; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a cool temperament, have always found, that more ſimple views were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0098102600:3"/>
ſufficient to make me act in a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; in this faith have I lived, and hope to die.</p>
                  <p>Your civilities to me ſo much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance your ſeverities, that I ſhould be ungrateful to take notice of ſome expreſſions, which, in the heat of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, have dropt from your pen. I muſt only complain of you a little for aſcribing to me the ſentiments which I had put into the mouth of the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic in the Dialogue. I have ſurely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to refute the Sceptic with all the force of which I am maſter; and my refutation muſt be allowed ſincere, becauſe drawn from the capital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of my ſyſtem. But you impute to me both the ſentiments of the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and the ſentiments of his antagoniſt,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0098102600:4"/>
which I can never admit of. In every Dialogue, no more than one perſon can be ſuppoſed to repreſent the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
                  <p>Your ſeverity on one head, that of Chaſtity, is ſo great, and I am ſo little conſcious of having given any juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to it, that it has afforded me a hint to form a conjecture, perhaps ill grounded, concerning your perſon.</p>
                  <p>I hope to ſteal a little leiſure from my other occupations, in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my philoſophy againſt your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks. If I have occaſion to give a new edition of the work, which you have honoured with an anſwer, I ſhall make great advantage of your remarks, and hope to obviate ſome of your criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms.</p>
                  <p>Your ſtyle is elegant, and full of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0098102600:5"/>
agreable imagery. In ſome few places, it does not fully come up to my ideas of purity and correctneſs. I ſuppoſe mine falls ſtill further ſhort of your ideas. In this reſpect, we may certainly be of uſe to each other. With regard to our Philoſophical ſyſtems, I ſuppoſe we are both ſo fixt, that there is no hope of any converſions betwixt us; and for my part, I doubt not but we ſhall both do as well to remain as we are.</p>
