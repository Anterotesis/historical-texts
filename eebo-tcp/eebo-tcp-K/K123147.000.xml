            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Book here preſented to the Public is compiled from
two of the moſt ſingular and illuſtrious philoſophers that ever
flouriſhed in this part of the world. It has been their fate,
with other great and good men in all ages, to incur the deepeſt
obloquy, even in the inſtant of conferring on mankind the
moſt laſting and extenſive benefits. Their works, however,
will endure as long as the language, and their names be recorded
with honour, while the hiſtory of <hi>Britain</hi> continues to intereſt
poſterity.</p>
            <p>The private characters of <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> exhibit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſtrikingly ſimilar, except their attachment to ſtudy, and
eager purſuit of literary Fame. The manners of the one were
ſimple, plain, amiable, and engaging: thoſe of the other, rather
ſtotely, often aſſuming, and uniformly refined. The youth, as
well as manhood, of the firſt, was ſpent, under every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in which fortune placed him, in a ſedulous and ſingle
attention to the cultivation and improvement of his literary
talents; that of the ſecond, apparently without any view what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and in ſcenes of the moſt exceptionable diſſipation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hume</hi> maintained through life an unſullied reputation for
every ſpecies of virtue and worth. In company or out of it,
abroad or at home, his good-nature never forſook him. His
temper was generally unruffled, even while the petulance of his
pious perſecutors expoſed him to the rudeſt inſult: and he
has been known to reviſe, with exemplary candour, the fouleſt
libels, preſented to him under the name of Anſwers to ſome
parts of his writings. The very poor in his neighbourhood,
though inſtigated by prieſtcraft to revile and execrate his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0877500300:3"/>
regarded his benevolence and humanity with a mixture
of reverence and gratitude. His deportment on every occaſion,
while eminently chaſte and manly, was altogether the reverſe
of pomp or oſtentation. Peculiarly affable and eaſy of acceſs,
he diſcovered nothing of the ſcholar, either in his appearance
or converſation; and all his attentions, being the ſpontaneous
effuſions of genuine philanthropy, were without ceremony or
parade. While his talents were vigorouſly exerted to overturn
the ſyſtem, his morals would have adorned the pureſt and moſt
primitive ages, of Chriſtianity! And he was neither wanting
in that extraordinary ſtrength of mind, nor in that ſingular
goodneſs of heart, which in every country and period of human
ſtory have always diſtinguiſhed the greateſt and the beſt of men.</p>
            <p>To this high degree of excellence in the firſt diſtinctions of
humanity, <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> had no claim. The ſublimeſt theory of
virtue which his exalted genius could either conceive or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
had yet but little influence on the management of his
paſſions. He was not a ſpeculative, only, but a practical, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine.
Stationed for a great number of years, and during
ſome of the moſt important periods of our hiſtory, in the giddy
vortex of public life, he was evidently too deeply engroſſed and
agitated, to be much ſuſceptible of thoſe tender endearments
which for the moſt part prompt and accompany the exerciſe of
private and domeſtic virtue. But towards the evening of his
days, in a ſituation not a little ſolitary and romantic, his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
and enlightened mind aſſumed a gravity and repoſe ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that majeſtic and commanding tone which had ever cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſed
its greateſt exertions. It was then only one of his
fondeſt admirers<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Lord</hi> Orrery.</note> remarks of him, that he united in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the wiſdom of <hi>Socrates</hi> with the ardour of <hi>Plato,</hi> the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and eaſe of <hi>Pliny</hi> with the wit and ſprightlineſs of <hi>Horace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Different as the talents in writing of theſe eminent authors
certainly were, the many bright ſpecimens of their taſte and
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0877500300:4"/>
genius, now in poſſeſſion of the public, diſcover a few points,
at leaſt, in which there is ſtill a very ſtriking likeneſs. The
infinite and irreparable miſchief done to ſociety by an affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of religion, where the reality of it was wanting, betrayed
each of them into a moſt implacable and unwarrantable averſion
to whatever bears the name: and under the obnoxious maſque
of bigotry, the moſt ſacred feelings and regards of mankind
are treated with due reſpect by neither. Still a rich and ſhining
variety of beautiful and intereſting paſſages, in the vicinity of
many very exceptionable ones, in both, have for this reaſon
been long loſt to thoſe, eſpecially, on whom they were likely
to produce the beſt effects. And the deſign of this little vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
is to extract from a huge collection of ſuch groſs materials
ſome of the pureſt ore, to enliſt on the ſide of Virtue the
greateſt advocates for Infidelity, and to deſpoil Vice of thoſe
meretricious weapons by which ſhe has done moſt execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bolingbroke</hi>'s genius was bold, pictureſque, ſplendid, and ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical;
that of <hi>Hume</hi> ſeemed more acute, conciſe, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating.
The one is diſtinguiſhed by a lofty and daring imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
by an inexhauſtible brilliancy of ideas, and by a diction
peculiarly expreſſive and tropical; the other, by a clear and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
underſtanding, by deep and accurate thinking, and by a ſtyle
uniformly eaſy, emphatical, and elegant. The conceptions of
the firſt were ſo ſtrong and ardent, that he graſped at Truth by
a kind of intuitive violence, without ſtooping to any of thoſe
ſlow and intermediate means by which ſhe condeſcends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
acceſſible to more ordinary minds: the ſecond poſſeſſed
all the powers of inveſtigation in ſuch perfection, as induced
him to ſpare no pains in the diſcovery of this important object
by the humble and diſpaſſionate, but certain mode of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Hiſtory and metaphyſics were the favourite and moſt
ſucceſsful ſtudy of <hi>Hume: Bolingbroke's</hi> letters on the firſt are
among the moſt finiſhed of his productions; but he never loſt
himſelf ſo completely as when he plunged into the bottomleſs
abyſs of the ſecond.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0877500300:5"/>
Both of theſe two celebrated writers have inveſtigated, in a
maſterly manner, the multifarious ſcience of politics. Their
ideas, however, in a great variety of the firſt and moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
particulars, are eſſentially different. The reaſonings of
<hi>Hume,</hi> on all thoſe popular and conſtitutional queſtions which
have been lately ſo repeatedly and ſo tenaciouſly debated in the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> ſenate, like his Hiſtory, may be conſidered as a moſt
ingenious and elegant apology for prerogative. His uncommon
talents are perpetually occupied, and not without ſucceſs, in
relaxing the general attachments of mankind to the important
bleſſings of liberty, in reconciling them to every poſſible modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of government, in ſuppreſſing their ſentiments of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence,
and in ſuggeſting new arguments for ſubmiſſion and
obedience. The opinions of <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> are not only more open
and decided, but uniformly on the ſide of freedom and the
rights of the ſubject, as ſettled at the Revolution. On this
delicate and intereſting ſubject his productions are to this day
without a parallel. Politics ſeem his own peculiar province, in
which, notwithſtanding his numerous compeers, he ſtill reigns
unrivalled. His <hi>Diſſertation on Parties,</hi> and <hi>Idea of a Patriot King,</hi>
are more replete than any thing elſe in the language with a
ſeries of obſervations and reaſonings concerning the diſtinct
privileges of prince and people, equally pertinent, original, and
perſuaſive. No where the dupe of thoſe chimerical illuſions
and conjectures which confound the ſhallow, and amuſe the
ſpeculative, the general principles on which his particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
are built, have all a ſold and permanent foundation in
fact, and the nature of things. His ſole and excluſive aim is to
graft the theory of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution on ancient uſage,
and to reduce it to preſent practice.</p>
            <p>This ſyſtem, ſo lately and ably revived by his Grace the
Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> is an obvious improvement by our noble
author on that which chiefly produced the Revolution. As it
does honour to his genius, it could not have found a better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate.
He evidently writes from the heart, and, whatever he
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0877500300:6"/>
ſays, affects his readers with a forcible emphaſis and propriety.
His conceptions, always formed with judgment and taſte, are
every where delivered with earneſtneſs and energy. The digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
manner in which he reprobates all thoſe ſelfiſh and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating
principles, or maxims, which keep moſt public men
in an infamous kind of equipoſſe between honour and intereſt,
peculiarly becomes him. It is the genuine, but indignant, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of virtue, ſpurn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng the inſidious approaches of vice under
the moſt qualified and deceitful appearances. In one word, he
treats the whole ſcience of government as proceeding regularly,
only when actuated by the great maſter-ſprings of right and
wrong. This is the key-ſtone or firſt principle of all his
politics; and to this, not, like <hi>Hume,</hi> to the manners of the
age, and the depravity of human nature, he directed all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and made all his appeals.</p>
            <p>In the following ſelection, an equal attention is paid to the
morals of <hi>Hume</hi> and the politics of <hi>Bolingbroke.</hi> We have enough
in all conſcience of that ſophiſtry and re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inement in which the
laſt was ſo great a maſter. He, perhaps, without intending,
has made it the cant of the day to ſneer avowedly at whatever
bears the ſemblance of principle in public life. The people of
<hi>England</hi> happily feel, and even begin at laſt to reſent, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
conſequences of this moſt profligate and temporizing
ſyſtem. <hi>Bolingbroke</hi>'s notions, on all points of preſent political
altercation or enquiry, are literally theirs. The ſubſtance of
what he thought and wrote, on whatever is moſt valuable and
intereſting in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution, is here combined and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.
And, to ſay the leaſt that can be ſaid, it is ſurely one
of the moſt ineſtimable legacies that ever a ſtateſman bequeathed
to his country.</p>

            <head>THE
LIFE
OF
DAVID HUME, Esq.</head>
            <p>MAN is conſtituted by nature, and moulded by habit, ſo
mechanically, that every individual may be ſaid to differ from
another as eſſentially in the biaſs of his mind, and the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
of his heart, as in the features of his face. Whatever
makes this diſtinction, is that fixed and governing principle by
which character is formed and eſtimated.</p>
            <p>A paſſion for literature runs viſibly through the whole of
<hi>Hume</hi>'s life, and gives a colouring to all his actions. Here all
his wiſhes terminated; and, to accompliſh diſtinction in this
excluſive line, every other view or proſpect of ambition was
ſacrificed. Nor does he owe more of his ſucceſs to uncommon
ability and addreſs, perhaps, than to his ſteady, ardent, and
unremitted purſuit of one great and intereſting concern. This,
at leaſt, clearly accounts for all that attachment to paradox and
pyrrhoniſm which ſo ſingularly characteriſe his metaphyſical
writings.</p>
            <p>His parents were deſcended of a good family, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
though not wealthy. He was born at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the
26th of <hi>April,</hi> 1711, old ſtyle. His patrimony was but trifling,
as he was only a younger brother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0877500300:8"/>
That predilection for ſtudy, which never forſook him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
itſelf at an early period. This, with his habits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
and application, diſpoſed his friends to ſix on the law as
a proper profeſſion for him. But he owns, while they thought
him poring on <hi>Vo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> and <hi>Vinnius,</hi> he was ſecretly devouring
<hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Impelled, however, by the narrowneſs of his fortune, he
thought of ſeriouſly attaching himſelf to buſineſs. For this
purpoſe he went to <hi>Briſtol;</hi> but, preferring retirement and
books to every other purſuit and proſpect, he ſoon left <hi>Briſtol,</hi>
and repaired to <hi>France,</hi> where he could live at leſs expence, and
proſecute his literary views with equal advantage.</p>
            <p>Partly at <hi>Rheims,</hi> but chiefly at <hi>La Flêche,</hi> in <hi>Anjou,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
his <hi>Treatiſe of Human Nature.</hi> There he reſided near
three years; and publiſhed this work ſhortly after his return to
<hi>England.</hi> But, to uſe his own phraſe, it <hi>fell dead-born from the
preſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was more fortunate in the firſt part of his <hi>Eſſays,</hi> which
appeared originally at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in 1742. It is remarkable
that about this time, though ſomewhat turned of thirty, he
recovered his knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> language, which he had
almoſt loſt through negligence.</p>
            <p>He went, in 1745, to live with the Marquis of <hi>Annandale,</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> on ſpecial invitation; and, having undertook the
tuition of that nobleman's ſon, he continued in this ſituation
for a twelvemonth.</p>
            <p>As ſecretary to General <hi>St. Clair,</hi> he attended in an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> and afterwards accompanied him in
his embaſſy to the courts of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Turin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0877500300:9"/>
The two years in which he was thus employed; were almoſt
the only interruption his general ſtudies ever received. It was
now he republiſhed his firſt performance under a new form;
but it ſucceeded little better than before.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this diſappointment, his fertile mind ſtill
teemed with freſh literary adventures. The ſcenes he had
lately reviewed in his official capacity, probably opened to him
a variety of original ſpeculations; and ſome of his former pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications
gaining on the public eſtimation; he was encouraged,
in 1752, to bring forth his <hi>Political Diſcourſes,</hi> which had a
moſt rapid ſale.</p>
            <p>Soon after appeared his <hi>Enquiry concerning the Principles of
Morals;</hi> which, in his own opinion, is, of all his writings,

            <p>His next performance was the <hi>Hiſtory of England,</hi> which he
commenced with the acceſſion of the Houſe of <hi>Stuart</hi> to the
ſovereignty of <hi>Britain.</hi> This work coſt him great pains, and
gave him much hope. It was received, however, ſo coolly,
that he ſcarcely heard of one man in the three kingdoms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
for rank or letters, that could endure it. The two
Primates of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> were, indeed, exceptions odd
enough; who ſent him ſeparate meſſages, not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.
But it was then, perhaps, as now, when court-creepers,
or ſticklers for prerogative, are the moſt likely to ſucceed in the
line of eccleſiaſtical preferment. This diſappointment had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
got the better of his reſolution; and a war, which at that
time ſubſiſted between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> was the only thing
that kept him from going into voluntary baniſhment. To this
accidental circumſtance we owe his completion of the moſt
finiſhed and claſſical Hiſtory this or any other country ever
produced.</p>

               <hi>The Natural Hiſtory of Religion</hi> was now publiſhed. This
gave a ſerious alarm to the religious ſentiments of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Many indirect attacks were made on it; and it brought
on the author all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
of the <hi>Warburtonian</hi> ſchool.</p>
            <p>Two years ſubſequent to the fall of the firſt, came out the
ſecond volume of his Hiſtory, which brought it down from the
death of <hi>Charles</hi> I. to the Revolution. This made him ſome
amends for his other literary miſcarriages: it was a popular
performance, and not only raiſed the character of the author,
but rendered the former volume of ſome requeſt.</p>
            <p>His account of the Houſe of <hi>Tudor</hi> was not publiſhed till
1759, and was then regarded with diſlike, eſpecially in <hi>England.</hi>
This, however, did not deter him from finiſhing, in two vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,
the more early periods of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſtory, which he
gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable, and but tolerable,
ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>He was then invited to attend the Earl of <hi>Hertford,</hi> on his
embaſſy to <hi>Paris;</hi> which, after ſome heſitation and reluctance,
he thought proper to accept. He ſpeaks with much ſatisfaction
of the pleaſure he received from the connexions to which this
appointment introduced him.</p>
            <p>The preſent Commander in Chief being appointed one of
his Majeſty's principal Secretaries of State, in 1767, our author
was made Under-Secretary. In this department he continued
for near two years, and went out with the then Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>He now poſſeſſed a thouſand pounds of yearly revenue, and
returned to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with the fond hopes of long enjoying,
at his leiſure, and among his friends, the honourable rewards
of his great talents and great induſtry.</p>

In about half a dozen years he was ſeized, however, with
a diſorder in his bowels, which at firſt gave him no alarm, but
which ſoon became incurable. He did not die till ſeveral
months after having given up all hopes of life. He ſuffered
but little pain, and retained his faculties and ſpirits to the
very laſt.</p>
            <p>He pronounces his own oulogium in a manner that ſhews
how well he deſerved it. We inſert it in this place as none of
the leaſt beautiful paſſages in his works.</p>

The ſame experimental mode of philoſophizing which the

applied by <hi>Locke</hi> to metaphyſics, and by <hi>Newton</hi> to phyſical phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,
our author uniformly adopts in all his diſquiſitions on
morals and human nature. It is in this ſyſtematic and rational
uſe of facts his chief excellence as an author and philoſopher
lies. Perhaps it may be ſaid of him, what <hi>Pope</hi> ſaid of <hi>Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,

            <p>Many have lamented much, that ever his great abilities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
any thing inimical to Chriſtianity. It afforded, however,
one very important example of decency and command of temper
to all her friends and apologiſts. For whatever obligations ſhe
may have to many of their labours, ſhe has none to ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
diſcovered in her behalf.</p>
            <p>Our author began his literary career with a reſolution, which
he inflexibly maintained through life, never to reply to any
body: and not being very iraſcible in his temper, he eaſily
kept clear of all literary ſquabbles. The unmanly ſarcaſms
even of a <hi>Beattie,</hi> the moſt illiberal and virulent of all his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts,
never extorted from him a ſingle invective. He regarded
his furious declamation only as ſo much froth, which he well
knew would ſubſide, and be forgotten, the moment the vapour
that produced it vaniſhed.</p>
            <p>About this time, a quarto edition of his <hi>Eſſays</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
in two volumes; to one of which the following Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
was prefixed: <q rend="inline">"Moſt of the principles and reaſonings

the author had projected before he left college, and which he

he was ſenſible of his error in going to the preſs too

where ſome negligences in his former reaſoning, and more in

who have honoured the author's philoſophy with anſwers,
have taken care to direct all their batteries againſt that juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile

affected to triumph in any advantages which they imagined
they had obtained over it: a practice very contrary to all rules

            <p>This Life we ſhall conclude with a Note, occaſioned by a

<hi>Scotland,</hi> who diſcovered on this, as on all other occaſions, ſuch
a manly attention to truth, as precluded the impertinent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

reſpectful anſwer in a manner equally honourable to both. The

               <q rend="inline">"AN ingenious writer has honoured this diſcourſe with an

from the beginning, to keep himſelf on the ſceptical ſide; and,
having taken this advantage of the ground, he was enabled,

            <head>THE
LIFE
OF
HENRY ST. JOHN,
LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HENRY ST. JOHN,</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> was born
in the year 1672, at <hi>Batterſea,</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> at a ſeat that had
been in the poſſeſſion of his anceſtors for ages before. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
was of the firſt rank, equally conſpicuous for its antiquity,
dignity, and large poſſeſſions. It is found to trace its original
as high as <hi>Adam de Port,</hi> Baron of <hi>Baſing,</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> before
the Conqueſt; and, in a ſucceſſion of ages, to have produced
warrio<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, patriots, and ſtateſmen; ſome of whom were conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
for their loyalty, and others for their defending the rights
of the people. His grandfather, Sir <hi>Walter St. John,</hi> of <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſea.</hi>
marrying one of the daughters of Lord Chief Juſtice
<hi>St. John,</hi> who, as all know, was ſtrongly attached to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican
party, <hi>Henry,</hi> the ſubject of the preſent memoir, was
brought up in his family, and conſequently imbibed the firſt
principles of his education amongſt the Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>Nature ſeemed not leſs kind to him in her external embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments,
than in adorning his mind. With the graces of an
handſome perſon, and a face in which dignity was happily
blended with ſweetneſs, he had a manner of addreſs that was
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0877500300:15"/>
very engaging. His vivacity was always awake, his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was quick, his wit refined, and his memory amazing:
his ſubtilty in thinking and reaſoning was profound; and all
theſe talents were adorned with an elocution that was irreſiſtible.</p>
            <p>To the aſſemblage of ſo many gifts from Nature, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that Art would ſoon give her finiſhing hand; and that
a youth begun in excellence, would ſoon arrive at perfection:
but ſuch is the perverſeneſs of human nature, that an age
which ſhould have been employed in the acquiſition of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
was diſſipated in pleaſure; and, inſtead of aiming to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
in praiſe-worthy purſuits, <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> ſeemed more ambitious
of being thought the greateſt rake about town.</p>
            <p>In this mad career of pleaſure he continued for ſome time;
but at length, in 1700, when he arrived at the twenty-eighth
year of his age, he began to take a diſlike to his method of
living, and to find that ſenſual pleaſure alone was not ſufficient
to make the happineſs of a reaſonable creature. He therefore
made his firſt effort to break from his ſtate of infatuation, by
marrying the daughter and coheireſs of Sir <hi>Henry Wincheſcomb,</hi>
a deſcendant from the famous <hi>Jack</hi> of <hi>Newbury,</hi> who, though
but a clothier, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was able to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the King, and all his retinue, in the moſt ſplendid manner.
This Lady was poſſeſſed of a fortune exceeding forty thouſand
pounds, and was not deficient in mental accompliſhments; but
whether he was not yet fully ſatiated with his former pleaſures,
or whether her temper was not conformable to his own, it is
certain they were far from living happily together. After co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
for ſome time together, they parted by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
both equally diſpleaſed; he complaining of the obſtinacy
of her temper, ſhe of the ſhameleſsneſs of his infidelity. A
great part of her fortune, ſome time after, upon his attainder,
was given her back; but as her family eſtates were ſettled upon
him, he enjoyed them after her death, upon the reverſal of his
attainder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0877500300:16"/>
It is impoſſible to do juſtice to the public life of this great
man, without giving a particular detail of politics for a great
number of years. His eloquence, abilities, and influence, ſoon
brought him forward in the ſervice of his country. The latter
end of Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s reign ſeems the period in which, of all
others, his capacity as a ſtateſman and miniſter ſhone with the
greateſt luſtre. That critical juncture called for the exertion of
all his eminent qualities; and it is agreed, that he managed the
contending factions which then divided the nation, a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive
continental war, an intriguing court, and a fickle Queen,
with an addreſs and ſucceſs equally exquiſite and unexpected.</p>
            <p>While thus induſtriouſly employed, he was not without the
rewards that deſerved to follow ſuch abilities, joined to ſo much
aſſiduity. In <hi>July</hi> 1712, he was created Baron <hi>St. John,</hi> of
<hi>Lidyard Tregoze,</hi> in <hi>Wittſhire,</hi> and Viſcount <hi>Bolingbroke;</hi> by the
laſt of which titles he is now generally known, and is likely to
be talked of by poſterity. He was alſo the ſame year appointed
Lord-Lieutenant of the county of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> By the titles of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goze</hi>
and <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> he united the honours of the elder and
younger branch of his family; and thus tranſmitted into one
channel, the oppoſing intereſts of two races, that had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed,
one for their loyalty to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. the other
for their attachment to the Parliament that oppoſed him. It
was afterwards his boaſt, that he ſteered clear of the extremes
for which his anceſtors had been diſtinguiſhed, having kept the
ſpirit of freedom of the one, and acknowledged the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that diſtinguiſhed the other.</p>
            <p>His quarrel with <hi>Oxford,</hi> whom he deſpiſed, expoſed both to
the moſt imminent deſtruction. So noble a mind was above
harbouring groundleſs reſentments, but no conceſſions could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
him to the baſe or worthleſs.</p>
            <p>On the acceſſion of <hi>George</hi> the Firſt, he ſhared the ruin of
his party; and, as one of their leaders, accumulated moſt of
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0877500300:17"/>
the odium their meaſures had incurred. The revenge of his
enemies, who had now wriggled themſelves into power, made
it unſafe for him to ſtay longer in <hi>England.</hi> Immediately on
his departure for <hi>France,</hi> a bill of attainder was preferred againſt
him.</p>
            <p>It was now, partly from reſentment and diſguſt, and partly
from a ſtrong predilection for the buſtle of office, but chiefly to
gratify his boundleſs ambition, that he joined the Pretender.
But in this new ſervice he found every thing ſo very mean and
mortifying, that he never appeared hearty in the buſineſs. Nor
was he treated with that confidence and cordiality, to which he
thought the ſacrifices he made, and his conſcious ability, juſtly
intitled him. It was his aim always to be foremoſt in every
adminiſtration, and he could not bear to act as a ſubaltern in ſo
paltry a court as that of the Pretender. Within leſs than a
twelvemonth he was therefore diſmiſſed, and even ſerved with
a mock impeachment, by his new maſter.</p>
            <p>This fortunate accident awakened all his ſenſibility, and
made him long, more than ever, for a participation of thoſe
liberties, the malice of his perſecutors had tempted him to forfeit.
To the intrigues of the court, perhaps, more than to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of friends, or any other cauſe, he owed the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this deſirable event. During this interval, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the painful ſuſpenſe in which we muſt ſuppoſe him, he
wrote <hi>Reflections on Exile,</hi> one of the moſt maſterly, the moſt
elegant, and the moſt affecting moral compoſitions in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
            <p>His firſt Lady, with whom he had not cohabited for years,
being now dead, he married a ſecond time, and, on his return
to <hi>England,</hi> devoted his time entirely to a country life, the
charms of philoſophy, and domeſtic happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0877500300:18"/>
Obſcurity, however, was not his element. While his friends
thought him reconciled to his fate, he ſecretly ſighed to emerge
a-new in a public capacity. But the miniſter of the day
dreaded his abilities and virtues. He petitioned the Houſe of
Commons to be reinſtated in his former emoluments and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities:
but the cabals of the cabinet defeated his wiſhes. This
inſtigated him to take part with <hi>Pultney,</hi> in his oppoſition to
<hi>Walpole.</hi> The laſt engaged to manage the Houſe of Commons,
and the firſt to open the eyes of the people.</p>
            <p>This great political controverſy laſted ten years; in the courſe
of which, our noble author elucidated all the beauties and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution with ſingular elegance and
perſpicuity. His ſyſtem of politics is certainly the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
and ſatisfactory of any in the language. Happily for this
country, it is now popular and predominant. And in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpts
from his writings, reſpect has been chiefly had to thoſe
leading ideas of miniſters, government, and the conſtitution,
which coincide moſt with the general ſentiments of the nation
on theſe ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Diſguſted with all parties, and apparently tired of every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,
he once more took leave of <hi>England,</hi> and retired to <hi>France.</hi>
But even in ſolitude his hours did not glide away in torpid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity.
Having no further chance of ruling his cotemporaries,
he revolved on ſecuring the applaute and gratitude of poſterity.
This laudable object he purſued, with dignity and ſucceſs, in a
courſe of <hi>Letters on the Study of Hiſtory;</hi> which exhibit the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
of his taſte, the energy of his mind, and the ſenſibility of
his heart, in the moſt amiable and uſeful point of view.</p>
            <p>It was here too, that, in a Letter addreſſed to Lord <hi>Bathurſt,</hi>
he apologizes for his attachment to retirement and ſtudy. This
Letter, like all his political writings, diſcovers much political
diſcernment, and has, what is wanting in moſt of them, great
moderation, and ſome fine morality.</p>

country; and, coming back from <hi>France,</hi> ſettled as <hi>Batterſea,</hi>
an old ſeat which was his father's, and had been long in the

calamity; and, thought it was not in his power to remove, he

the concluſion of the peace, two years before the meaſures
taken by the adminiſtration ſeemed not to have been repugnant
to his notions of political prudence for that juncture; in that
year he wrote his laſt production, containing Reflections on the
then State of the Nation, principally with regard to her Taxes
and Debts, and on the Cauſes and Conſequences of them. This
undertaking was left unfiniſhed; for Death ſnatched the pen
from the hand of the writer.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed the latter part of his life in dignity and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
his rational faculties improved by reflection, and his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
kept under by diſappointment, his whole aim ſeemed to
have been to leave the ſtage of life, on which he had acted ſuch
various parts, with applauſe. He had long withed to fetch his
laſt breath at <hi>Batterſea,</hi> the place whe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e he was born; and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that had through life ſeemed to traverſe all his aims, at
laſt indulged him in this. He had long been troubled with a
cancer in his cheek; by which excruciating diſeaſe he died, on
the verge of fourſcore years of age. He was conſonant with
himſelf to the laſt; and thoſe principles which he had all along
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0877500300:20"/>
avowed, he confirmed with his dying breath; having given
orders that none of the clergy ſhould be permitted to trouble
him in his lateſt moments.</p>
            <p>In this manner lived and died Lord <hi>Bolingbroke;</hi> ever active,
never depreſſed; ever purſuing Fortune, and as conſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
by her. In whatever light we view his character,
we ſhall find him an object rather proper for our wonder, than
our imitation; more to be feared than eſteemed, and gaining
our admiration without our love. His ambition ever aimed at
the ſummit of power; and nothing ſeemed capable of ſatisfying
his immoderate deſires, but the liberty of governing all things
without a rival. With as much ambition, as great abilities, and
more acquired knowledge than <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he wanted only his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to be as ſucceſsful; but the ſchemes his head dictated, his
heart often refuſed to execute; and he loſt the ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
juſt when the great occaſion called for all his efforts to
engage.</p>
            <p>The ſame ambition that prompted him to be a politician,
actuated him as a philoſopher. His aims were equally great
and extenſive in both capacities. Unwilling to ſubmit to any
power in the one, or any authority in the other, he entered the
fields of ſcience with a thorough contempt of all that had been
eſtabliſhed before him; and ſeemed to think every thing wrong,
that he might ſhew his faculty in the reformation. It might
have been better for his quiet, as a man, if he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to act a ſubordinate character in the ſtate; and it had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
been better for his memory as a writer, if he had aimed
at doing leſs than he attempted. Wiſdom in morals, like every
other art or ſcience, is an accumulation that numbers have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to increaſe; and it is not for one ſingle man to pretend,
that he can add more to the heap than the thouſands that have
gone before him. Such innovators more frequently retard than
promote knowledge; their maxims are more agreeable to the
reader, by having the gloſs of novelty to recommend them,
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0877500300:21"/>
than thoſe which are trite, only becauſe they are true. Such
men are therefore followed, at firſt, with avidity; nor is it till
ſome time that their diſciples begin to find their error. They
often, though too late, perceive, that they have been following
a ſpeculative enquiry, while they have been leaving a practical
good; and, while they have been practiſing the arts of doubting,
they have been loſing all firmneſs of principle, which might
tend to eſtabliſh the rectitude of their private conduct. As a
moraliſt, therefore, Lord <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> by having endeavoured at
too much, ſeems to have done nothing; but as a political
writer, few can equal, and none can exceed him. As he was a
practical poſicician, his writings are leſs filled with thoſe ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
illuſions, which are the reſult of ſolitude and ſecluſion.
He wrote them with a certainty of their being oppoſed, ſifted,
examined, and reviled; he therefore took care to build them
up of ſuch materials as could not be eaſily overthrown: they
prevailed at the times in which they were written; they ſtill
continue to be the admiration of the preſent age, and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
laſt for ever.</p>

               <head>THE GOLDEN AGE.</head>
               <p>THE ſeaſons, in this firſt period of nature,
were ſo temperate, that there was no neceſſity
for men to provide themſelves with clothes and
houſes, as a ſecurity againſt the violence of heat
and cold. The rivers flowed with wine and milk.
The oaks yielded honey; and nature ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
produced her greateſt delicacies. Nor were
theſe the chief advantages of that happy age.
Tempeſts were not alone removed from nature;
but thoſe more furious tempeſts were unknown to
human breaſts, which now cauſe ſuch uproar, and
engender ſuch confuſion. Avarice, ambition, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
ſelfiſhneſs, were never heard of: cordial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
compaſſion, ſympathy, were the only
movements with which the mind was yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.
Even the punctilious diſtinction of <hi>mine</hi>
and <hi>thine</hi> was baniſhed from among that happy
race of mortals, and carried with it the very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0877500300:33"/>
of property and obligation, juſtice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe that nature has beſtowed on the
human race ſuch profuſe abundance of all external
conveniences, that without any uncertainty in the
event, without any care or induſtry on our part,
every individual finds himſelf fully provided with
whatever his moſt voracious appetites can want,
or luxurious imagination wiſh or deſire. His na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
beauty, we ſhall ſuppoſe, ſurpaſſes all acquired
ornaments. The perpetual clemency of the ſeaſon
renders uſeleſs all clothes or covering. The raw
herbage affords him the moſt delicious fare; the
clear fountain, the richeſt beverage. No laborious
occupation required; no tillage; no navigation.
Muſic, poetry, and contemplation, form his ſole
buſineſs; converſation, mirth, and friendſhip, his
ſole amuſement.</p>
               <p>Thus the Hours paſs unperceived along, and
lead in their wanton train all the pleaſures of ſenſe,
and all the joys of harmony and friendſhip Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Innocence</hi> cloſes the proceſſion; and, while ſhe
preſents herſelf to our raviſhed eyes, ſhe embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes
the whole ſcene, and renders the view of
theſe pleaſures as tranſporting after they have
paſſed us, as when, with languiſhing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
they were yet advancing towards us.</p>

               <head>HUMANITY.</head>
               <p>When <hi>Pericles,</hi> the great <hi>Athenian</hi> ſtateſman and
general, was on his death-bed, his ſurrounding
friends, deeming him now inſenſible, began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
their ſorrow for their expiring patron, by
enumerating his great qualities and ſucceſſes, his
conqueſts and victories, the unuſual length of his
adminiſtration, and his nine trophies erected over
the enemies of the republic. 'You forget,' cries
the dying hero, who had heard all, 'you forget
the moſt eminent of my praiſes, while you dwell
ſo much on thoſe vulgar advantages in which
fortune had the principal ſhare. You have not
obſerved, that no citizen has ever yet worn
mourning on my account.'</p>
               <p>While the human heart is compounded of the
ſame elements as at preſent, it will never be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indifferent to the public good, nor entirely
unaffected with the tendency of characters and
manners: and, though this affection of humanity
may not generally be eſteemed ſo ſtrong as vanity
or ambition, yet, being common to all men, it
can alone be the foundation of morals, or of any

Does the ſage preſerve himſelf always in this
philoſophic indifference, and reſt contented with
lamenting the miſeries of mankind, without ever
employing himſelf for their relief? Does he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
indulge this ſevere wiſdom, which, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to elevate him above human accidents,
does in reality harden his heart, and render him
careleſs of the intereſt of mankind, and of ſociety?
No; he knows that in this ſullen apathy neither
true wiſdom, nor true happineſs, is to be found.
He feels too ſtrongly the charm of the ſocial affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ever to counteract ſo ſweet, ſo natural, ſo
virtuous a propenſity. Even when bathed in tears,
he laments the miſeries of the human race, of his
country, of his friends; and, unable to give ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
can only relieve them by compaſſion; he yet
rejoices in the generous diſpoſition, and feels a
ſatisfaction ſuperior to that of the moſt indulged
ſenſe. So engaging are the ſentiments of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that they brighten up the very face of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and operate like the ſun, which, ſhining on

When the tempers of men are ſoftened, as well as

which diſtinguiſhes a civilized age from
times of barbarity and ignorance. Factions are
then leſs inveterate, revolutions leſs tragical, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
leſs ſevere, and ſeditions leſs frequent.
Even foreign wars abate of their cruelty; and,

have introduced the rules of good-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

of minds, and an undiſturbed commerce and
converſation. Among well-bred people, a mutual
deference is affected; contempt of others diſguiſed;
authority concealed; attention given to each in his

without vehemence, without mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
without eagerneſs for oratory, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

dread of intruſion or injury towards others, that
<hi>pudor,</hi> which is the proper guardian of every kind

it is oppoſed to impudence and arrogance, and
expreſſes a diffidence of our own judgment, and
due attention and regard for others. In young
men, chiefly, this quality is a ſure ſign of good-ſenſe,
and is alſo the certain means of augmenting
that endowment, by preſerving their ears open to
inſtruction, and making them ſtill graſp after new

exceed all the power of Philoſophy. Happy if ſhe
be thence ſenſible of her temerity, when ſhe pries

ſo full of obſcurities and perplexities, returns with
ſuitable modeſty to her true and proper province,
the examination of common life; where ſhe will
find difficulties enough to employ her enquiries,

without launching into ſo boundleſs an ocean of

               <p>What a malignant philoſophy muſt it be, that
will not allow to humanity and friendſhip the ſame
privileges which are indiſputably granted to the
darker paſſions of enmity and reſentment! Such a

               <p>Though the philoſophical truth of any propoſition
by no means depends on its tendency to promote

grace who delivers a theory, however true, which,
he muſt confeſs, leads to a practice dangerous and
pernicious. Why rake into thoſe corners of nature
which ſpread nuiſance all around? Why dig up
the peſtilence from the pit, in which it is buried?
The ingenuity of your reſearches may be admired,
but your ſyſtems will be deteſted: and mankind
will agree, if they cannot refute them, to ſink
them, at leaſt, in eternal ſilence and oblivion.
Truths which are pernicious to ſociety, if any

Virtue in all her genuine and moſt engaging charms,
and make us approach her with eaſe, familiarity,

which many divines, and ſome philoſophers, had
covered her; and nothing appears but gentleneſs,
humanity, beneficence, affability; nay, even, at
proper intervals, play, frolic, and gaiety. She
talks not of uſeleſs auſterities and rigours, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſelf-denial. She declares, that her ſole
purpoſe is to make her votaries, and all mankind,
during every inſtant of their exiſtence, if poſſible,
chearful and happy; nor does ſhe ever willingly
part with any pleaſure, but in hopes of ample
compenſation in ſome other period of their lives.
The ſole trouble which ſhe demands, is that of
juſt calculation, and a ſteady preference of the
greater happineſs. And if any auſtere pretenders
approach her, enemies to joy and pleaſure, ſhe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rejects them as hypocrites and deceivers; or,
if ſhe admits them in her train, they are ranked,
however, as the leaſt favoured of her votaries.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have a propenſity to philoſophy, will
ſtill continue their reſearches; becauſe they reflect,
that, beſides the immediate pleaſure attending ſuch
an occupation, philoſophical deciſions are nothing

corrected. But they will never be tempted to go

               <p>A man may as well pretend to cure himſelf of

there the coarſeneſs of her ſkin, and monſtrous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion

moderate any paſſion by the artificial arguments of
a Seneca or an Epictetus. The remembrance of
the natural aſpect and ſituation of the object, will
in both caſes ſtill recur upon him. The reflections
of philoſophy are too ſubtle and diſtant to take
place in common life, or eradicate any affection.
The air is too fine to breathe in, where it is above

               <p>His appears the moſt perfect charcter, who, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
an equal ability and taſte for books, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,

diſcernment and delicacy, which are the natural
reſult of a juſt philoſophy. In order to diffuſe and

be more uſeful than compoſitions of the eaſy ſtyle

full of noble ſentiments and wiſe precepts,
applicable to every exigence of human life. By

               <p>The eaſy and obvious philoſophy will always,
with the generality of mankind, have the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

many will be recommended, not only as more

more into common life; moulds the heart and
affections, and, by touching thoſe principles which
actuate men, reforms their conduct, and brings
them nearer that model of perfection which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes.
Abſtruſe philoſophy, being founded on a
turn of mind which cannot enter into buſineſs and
action, vaniſhes when the philoſopher leaves the
ſhade, and comes into open day; nor can its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
eaſily retain any influence over our conduct
and behaviour. The feelings of our heart, the
agitation of our paſſions, the vehemence of our
affections, diſſipate all its concluſions, and reduce
the profound philoſopher to a mere plebeian.</p>
               <p>In every art or profeſſion, even thoſe which moſt
concern life or action, a ſpirit of accuracy, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
acquired, carries all of them nearer their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and renders them more ſubſervient to the

may live remote from buſineſs, the genius of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,

if carefully cultivated by ſeveral, muſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually

ſeem to poſſeſs, and according to the light in which

all helps from poetry and eloquence, and
treating their ſubject in an eaſy and obvious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

and, alluring us into the paths of virtue by

               <head>GALLANTRY.</head>
               <p>TO correct ſuch groſs vices as lead us to commit
real injury on others, is the part of morals, and
the object of the moſt ordinary education. Where
that is not attended to, in ſome degree, no human
ſociety can ſubſiſt. But, in order to render conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
and the intercourſe of minds, more eaſy and
agreeable, good-manners have been invented, and
have carried the matter ſomewhat farther. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
nature has given the mind a propenſity to any
vice, or to any paſſion diſagreeable to others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
breeding has taught men to throw the biaſs
on the oppoſite ſide, and to preſerve in all their
behaviour the appearance of ſentiments different
from thoſe to which they naturally incline. Thus,
as we are commonly proud and ſelfiſh, and apt to
aſſume the preference above others, a polite man
learns to behave with deference towards his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and to yield the ſuperiority to them in all
the common incidents of ſociety. In like manner,
wherever a perſon's ſituation may naturally beget
any diſagreeable ſuſpicion in him, it is the part of
good-manners to prevent it by a ſtudied diſplay of
ſentiments directly contrary to thoſe of which he
is apt to be jealous. Thus, old men know their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0877500300:60"/>
infirmities, and naturally dread contempt from the
youth; hence, well-educated youth redouble the
inſtances of reſpect and deference to their elders.
Strangers and foreigners are without protection;
hence, in all polite countries, they receive the
higheſt civilities., and are intitled to the firſt place
in every company. A man is lord in his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and his gueſts are, in a manner, ſubject to
his authority; hence, he is always the loweſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the company; attentive to the wants of every
one; and giving himſelf all the trouble, in order
to pleaſe, which may not betray too viſible an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation,
or impoſe too much conſtraint on his
gueſts. Gallantry is nothing but an inſtance of
the ſame generous attention. As nature has given
man the ſuperiority above woman, by endowing
him with greater ſtrength both of mind and body,
it is his part to alleviate that ſuperiority, as much
as poſſible, by the generoſity of his behaviour, and
by a ſtudied deference for all her inclinations and
opinions. Barbarous nations diſplay this ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by reducing their females to the moſt abject
ſlavery; by confining, them, by beating them, by
ſelling them, by killing them. But the male ſex
among a polite people diſcover their authority in a
more generous, though not a leſs evident manner;
by civility, by reſpect, by complaiſance, and, in
a word, by gallantry. In good company, you need
not aſk who is the maſter of the feaſt. The man
who ſits in the loweſt place, and who is always induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious
in helping every one, is certainly the perſon.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0877500300:61"/>
We muſt either condemn all ſuch inſtances of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
as foppiſh and affected, or admit of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
among the reſt. The ancient <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
wedded their wives with a whip, inſtead of a ring.
The ſame people, in their own houſes, took always
the precedence above foreigners, even foreign am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</p>
               <p>Gallantry is not leſs conſiſtent with wiſdom and
prudence, than with nature and generoſity; and,
when under proper regulations, contributes more
than any other invention to the entertainment and
improvement of both ſexes. Among every ſpecies
of animals, nature has founded on the love between
the ſexes their ſweeteſt and beſt enjoyments. But
the ſatisfaction of the bodily appetite is not alone
ſufficient to gratify the mind; and even among
brute creatures, we find that their play and dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and other expreſſions of fondneſs, form the

we muſt certainly admit the mind for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

I met him lately in a circle of the gayeſt company,
and he was the very life and ſoul of our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
ſo much wit with good-manners, ſo much

knowledge ſo genteelly delivered, I have never

               <p>You would admire him ſtill more, ſays a fourth,
if you knew him more familiarly. That chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0877500300:80"/>
which you might remark in him, is not a
ſudden flaſh ſtruck out by company; it runs
through the whole tenor of his life, and preſerves
a perpetual ſerenity on his countenance, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
in his ſoul. He has met with ſevere trials,
misfortunes as well as dangers, and by his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <p>The image, gentlemen, which you have here
delineated of <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> cry I, is that of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed

               <p>It may be pretended, that the diſorders of the

eloquence, that he was in a manner conſtrained to
change his ſettled purpoſe and reſolution, and to
abſolve a criminal, whom, before that orator ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
he was determined to condemn.</p>
               <p>The orator, by the force of his own genius and

pity, ſorrow; and then communicated
theſe impetuous movements to his audience.</p>
               <p>There is a great prejudice againſt ſet ſpeeches;
and a man can ſcarce eſcape ridicule, who repeats
a diſcourſe as a ſchool-boy does his leſſon, and
takes no notice of any thing that has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in the courſe of the debate. But where is
the neceſſity of falling into this abſurdity? A pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
ſpeaker muſt know, before-hand, the queſtion
under debate. He may compoſe all the arguments,
objections, and anſwers, ſuch as he thinks will be

occur, he may ſupply it from his invention;

regarded as a vice, and was an object of
declamation to all ſatiriſts and ſevere moraliſts.
Thoſe who prove, or attempt to prove, that ſuch

               <p>Let us conſider what we call vicious luxury.
No gratification, however ſenſual, can of itſelf be

when it engroſſes all a man's expence, and leaves

any prejudice reſult to ſociety? On the contrary,
the ſame conſumption would ariſe; and that labour
which at preſent is employed only in producing a
ſlender gratification to one man, would relieve the
neceſſitous, and beſtow ſatisfaction on hundreds.
The ſame care and toil that raiſe a diſh of peaſe

other defect in human nature, ſuch as indolence,
ſelfiſhneſs, inattention to others, for which luxury

               <p>THERE is very little ground, either from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or obſervation, to conclude the world eternal
or incorruptible. The continual and rapid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of matter, the violent revolutions with which
every part is agitated, the changes remarked in the
heavens, the plain traces as well as tradition of
an univerſal deluge, or general convulſion of
the elements; all theſe prove ſtrongly the morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of this fabric of the world, and its paſſage, by
corruption or diſſolution, from one ſtate or order
to another. It muſt, therefore, as well as each
individual form which it contains, have its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
youth, manhood, and old age; and it is
probable that, in all theſe variations, man, equally
with every animal and vegetable, will partake.
In the flouriſhing age of the world, it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that the human ſpecies ſhould poſſeſs greater
vigour, both of mind and body, more proſperous
health, higher ſpirits, longer life, and a ſtronger
inclination and power of generation; but, if the
general ſyſtem of things, and human ſociety of
courſe, have any ſuch gradual revolutions, they
are too ſlow to be diſcernible in that ſhort period
which is comprehended by hiſtory and tradition.
Stature and force of body, length of life, even
courage, and extent of genius, ſeem hitherto to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0877500300:108"/>
have been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the
ſame. The arts and ſciences, indeed, have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
in one period, and have decayed in another;
but, at the time when they roſe to greateſt perfection
among one people, they were, perhaps, totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to all the neighbouring nations; and,
though they univerſally decayed in one age, yet
in a ſucceeding generation they again revived, and
diffuſed themſelves over the world. As far, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as obſervation reaches, there is no univerſal
difference diſcernible in the human ſpecies; and
though it were allowed that the univerſe, like an
animal body, had a natural progreſs from infancy
to old-age, yet, as it muſt ſtill be uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at preſent it be advancing to its point of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
or declining from it, we cannot thence
preſuppoſe any decay in human nature.</p>

               <p>NO one has ever been able to tell preciſely what
wit is, and to ſhew why ſuch a ſyſtem of thought
muſt be received under that denomination, and
ſuch another rejected. It is by taſte alone we can
decide concerning it; nor are we poſſeſed of any
other ſtandard by which we can form a judgment
of this nature. Now, what is this taſte, from
which true and falſe wit in a manner receive their

nothing but a ſenſation of pleaſure from true

able to tell the reaſons of that ſatisfaction or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs.
The power of exciting theſe oppoſite

and nobility is much better rooted; and would
render the contention very unequal, if ever we
come to that extremity. One would incline to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to this event a very near period, ſuch as half
a century, had not our fathers prophecies of this
kind been found fallacious, by the duration of our
public credit ſo much beyond all reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
When the aſtrologers in <hi>France</hi> were

"theſe fellows," ſays he, "muſt be right at laſt."</p>
               <p>When the nation becomes heartily ſick of her
debts, and is cruelly oppreſſed by them, ſome
daring projector may ariſe with viſionary ſchemes
for their diſcharge: and as public credit will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
by that time, to be a little frail, the leaſt
touch will deſtroy it, as happened in <hi>France</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

               <p>Let the time come, and ſurely it will come,
when the new funds created for the exigencies of
the year are not ſubſcribed to, and raiſe not the

money projected. Suppoſe either that the caſh of
the nation is exhauſted; or that our faith, which
has been hitherto ſo ample, begins to fail us: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that, in this diſtreſs, the nation is threatened
with an invaſion; a rebellion is ſuſpected, or broken
out at home; a ſquadron cannot be equipped, for
want of pay, victuals, or repairs; or even a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
ſubſidy cannot be advanced. What muſt a
prince or miniſter do in ſuch an emergence? The
right of ſelf-preſervation is unalienable in every
individual, much more in every community: and
the folly of our ſtateſmen muſt then be greater
than the folly of thoſe who firſt contracted debt,
or, what is more, than that of thoſe who truſted,
or continue to truſt, this ſecurity, if theſe ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have the means of ſafety in their hands, and
do not employ them. The funds created and
mortgaged, will, by that time, bring in a large
yearly revenue, ſufficient for the defence and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the nation: money is perhaps lying in the
Exchequer, ready for the diſcharge of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
intereſt: neceſſity calls, fear urges, reaſon
exhorts, compaſſion alone exclaims: the money
will immediately be ſeized for the current ſervice,
under the moſt ſolemn proteſtations, perhaps, of
being immediately replaced. But no more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.
The whole fabric, already tottering, falls
to the ground, and buries thouſands in its ruins.</p>
               <p>Here thouſands are ſacrificed to the ſafety of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions;
but we are not without danger that millions
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0877500300:123"/>
may be ſacrificed for ever to the temporary ſafety
of thouſands. Our popular government, perhaps,
will render it difficult or dangerous for a miniſter
to venture on ſo deſperate an expedient, as that
of a voluntary bankruptcy. And though the Houſe
of Lords be altogether compoſed of proprietors of
land, and the Houſe of Commons chiefly; and
conſequently neither of them can be ſuppoſed to
have great property in the funds: yet the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the members may be ſo great with the
proprietors, as to render them more tenacious of
public faith, than prudence, policy, or even juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
ſtrictly ſpeaking, requires. And perhaps,
too, our ſoreign enemies may be ſo politic as to
diſcover, that our ſafety lies in deſpair, and may
not therefore ſhew the danger open and bare-faced,
till it be inevitable. The balance of power in
<hi>Europe,</hi> our grandfathers, our fathers, and we,
have all eſteemed too unequal to be preſerved
without our attention and aſſiſtance. But our
children, weary of the ſtruggle, and fettered with
incumbrances, may ſit down ſecure, and ſee their
neighbours oppreſſed and conquered; till, at laſt,
they themſelves and their creditors lie both at the
mercy of the conqueror. And this may properly
enough be denominated the violent death of our
public credit.</p>

that the moſt ancient rude combinations of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
were formed intirely by that principle. In

               <p>MEN deemed a diſpenſing power to be in fact
the ſame with a repealing power; and they could
not conceive that leſs authority was requiſite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal

under a popiſh ſucceſſor: as ſuch it had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
on by the parliament; as ſuch, granted by the
king; as ſuch, during the debates with regard to
the excluſion, recommended by the chancellor:—
by what magic, what chicane of law, is it now
annihilated, and rendered of no validity? Theſe
queſtions were every where aſked; and men, ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
by precedents and deciſions of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
were reduced either to queſtion the antiquity
of this prerogative itſelf, or to aſſert that even the
practice of five centuries could not beſtow on it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0877500300:132"/>
authority. It was not conſidered that the
preſent difficulty, or ſeeming abſurdity, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from late innovations introduced into the
government. Ever ſince the beginning of this
century, the parliament had, with the moſt lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
zeal, been acquiring powers, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
principles, favourable to law and liberty; the
authority of the crown had been limited in many
important particulars; and penal ſtatutes were
often calculated to ſecure the conſtitution againſt
the attempts of miniſters, as well as to preſerve
general peace, and repreſs crimes and immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
A prerogative, however, derived from very
ancient and almoſt uniform practice, the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
power, ſtill remained, or was ſuppoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
with the crown, ſufficient in an inſtant to
overturn this whole fabric, and to throw down all
the fences of the conſtitution. If this prerogative,
which carries on the face of it ſuch ſtrong ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
of an abſolute authority in the crown, had
yet, in ancient times, ſubſiſted with ſome degree
of liberty in the ſubject, this fact only proves, that
ſcarce any human government, much leſs one erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and uniform in all its parts. But to expect
that the diſpenſing power could in any degree be
rendered compatible with thoſe accurate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
limitations which had of late been eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and which the people were determined to

by means of it a more uniform edifice was at laſt
erected; the monſtrous inconſiſtence, ſo viſible,

               <p>IF ever, on any occaſion, it were laudable to

that the doctrine of reſiſtance affords ſuch
an example, and that all ſpeculative reaſoners
ought to obſerve, with regard to this principle,
the ſame cautious ſilence which the laws, in every
ſpecies of government, have ever preſcribed to
themſelves. Government is inſtituted, in order to
reſtrain the fury and injuſtice of the people; and
being always founded on opinion, not on force,
it is dangerous to weaken, by theſe ſpeculations,
the reverence which the multitude owe to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and to inſtruct them before-hand, that the
caſe can ever happen, when they may be freed
from their duty of allegiance. Or, ſhould it be
found impoſſible to reſtrain the licence of human
diſquiſitions, it muſt be acknowledged, that the
doctrine of obedience ought alone to be inculcated;
and that the exceptions, which are very rare, ought
ſeldom or never to be mentioned in popular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
and diſcourſes. Nor is there any danger,
that mankind, by this prudent reſerve, ſhould
univerſally degenerate into a ſtate of abject ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
Where the exception really occurs, even
though it be not previouſly expected and deſcanted
on, it muſt from its very nature be ſo obvious and
undiſputed, as to remove all doubt, and overpower
the reſtraint, however great, impoſed by teaching
the general doctrine of obedience. But between
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0877500300:135"/>
reſiſting a prince and dethroning him, there is a
very wide interval; and the abuſes of power which
can warrant the latter violence, are much greater
and more enormous than thoſe which will juſtify
the former. Hiſtory, however, ſupplies us with
examples even of this kind; and the reality of this
ſuppoſition, though for the future it ought ever to
be little looked for, muſt, by all candid enquirers,
be acknowledged in the paſt. But between the
dethroning a prince, and puniſhing him, there is
another very wide interval; and it were not ſtrange,
if even men of the moſt enlarged thought ſhould
queſtion, whether human nature could ever, in any
monarch, reach that height of depravity, as to
warrant in revolted ſubjects this laſt act of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
juriſdiction. That illuſion, if it be an
illuſion, which teaches us to pay a ſacred regard
to the perſons of princes, is ſo ſalutary, that to
diſſipate it by the formal trial and puniſhment of a
ſovereign, will have more pernicious effects upon
the people, than the example of juſtice can be
ſuppoſed to have a beneficent influence upon
princes, by checking their career of tyranny. 'Tis
dangerous alſo, by theſe examples, to reduce princes
to deſpair, or bring matters to ſuch extremities
againſt perſons endowed with great power, as to
leave them no reſource, but in the moſt violent

               <head>THE EUTHANASIA OF THE BRITISH
CONSTITUTION.</head>
               <p>AS one kind of death may be preferable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
it may be enquired, whether it be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
for the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution to terminate in
a popular government, or in abſolute monarchy?
Here I would frankly declare, that, though liberty
be preferable to ſlavery, in almoſt every caſe, yet
I ſhould rather wiſh to ſee an abſolute monarchy
than a republic in this iſland: for, let us conſider
what kind of republic we have reaſon to expect.
The queſtion is not concerning any fine imaginary
republic, of which a man may form a plan in his
cloſet. There is no doubt, but a popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be imagined more perfect than abſolute
monarchy, or even than our preſent conſtitution.
But what reaſon have we to expect that any ſuch
government will ever be eſtabliſhed in <hi>Britain,</hi>
upon the diſſolution of our monarchy? If any
ſingle perſon acquire power enough to take our
conſtitution to pieces, and put it up a-new, he is
really an abſolute monarch; and we have already
had an inſtance of this kind, ſufficient to convince
us, that ſuch a perſon will never reſign his power,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0877500300:137"/>
or eſtabliſh any free government. Matters, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
muſt be truſted to their natural progreſs and
operation; and the Houſe of Commons, according
to its preſent conſtitution, muſt be the only legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
in ſuch a popular government. The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
attending ſuch a ſituation of affairs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
themſelves by thouſands. If the Houſe of
Commons, in ſuch a caſe, ever diſſolve itſelf, which
is not to be expected, we may look for a civil war
every election. If it continue itſelf, we ſhall ſuffer
all the tyranny of a faction, ſubdivided into new
factions. And, as ſuch violent government can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
long ſubſiſt, we ſhall at laſt, after many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions
and civil wars, find repoſe in abſolute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
which it would have been happier for us
to have eſtabliſhed peaceably from the beginning.
Abſolute monarchy, therefore, is the eaſieſt death;
the true <hi>Euthanaſia</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution.</p>

               <head>THE DOWNFALL OF THE ROMAN
EMPIRE.</head>
               <p>THE period was now come when that enormous
fabric of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, which had diffuſed
ſlavery and oppreſſion, together with peace and
civility, on ſo conſiderable a part of the globe,
was approaching towards its final diſſolution.
<hi>Italy,</hi> and the centre of the empire, removed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſo many ages from all concern in the wars,
had entirely loſt the military ſpirit, and were peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
by an enervated race, equally diſpoſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to a foreign yoke, or to the tyranny of their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0877500300:138"/>
own rulers. The emperors found themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to recruit their legions from the frontier
provinces, where the genius of war, though lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
was not totally extinct; and theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
forces, careleſs of laws and civil inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
eſtabliſhed a military government, no leſs
dangerous to the ſovereign than to the people.
The farther progreſs of the ſame diſorders intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the bordering barbarians into the ſervice of
the <hi>Romans;</hi> and thoſe fierce nations, having now
added diſcipline and ſkill to their native bravery,
could no longer be reſtrained by the impotent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
of the emperors, who were accuſtomed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the one in the deſtruction of the other. Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of their own force, and allured by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of ſo rich a prize, the Northern barbarians,
in the reign of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> aſſailed at
once all the frontiers of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire; and,
having firſt ſatiated their avidity by plunder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to think of fixing a ſettlement in the waſted
provinces. The more diſtant barbarians, who oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
the deſerted habitations of the former, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in their acquiſitions, and preſſed with their

to the load which it ſuſtained. Inſtead of
arming the people in their own defence, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
recalled all the diſtant legions, in whom
alone they could repoſe confidence, and collected
the whole military force for the defence of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
and centre of the empire. The neceſſity of
ſelf-preſervation had ſuperſeded the ambition of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0877500300:139"/>
power; and the ancient point of honour, of never

<hi>Engliſh</hi> government as a mixture of the ſame kind,
where the liberty predominates. The conſequences
are ſuch as may be expected from thoſe mixed
forms of government, which beget a mutual
watchfulneſs and jealouſy. The <hi>Roman</hi> emperors
were, many of them, the moſt frightful monſters
that ever diſgraced human nature; and it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
their cruelty was chiefly excited by their
jealouſy, and by their obſerving that all the great

of a family which, but a little before, was no way
ſuperior to their own. On the other hand, as the
republican part of the government prevails in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
though with a great mixture of monarchy,
it is obliged, for its own preſervation, to maintain
a watchful jealouſy over the magiſtrates, to remove
all diſcretionary powers, and to ſecure every one's
life and fortune by general and inflexible laws:
no action muſt be deemed a crime but what the

               <p>BEFORE aſſembling the preſent parliament,

enjoyed himſelf in every pleaſure which a fine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
a generous diſpoſition, and an opulent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
could afford. Called into public life, he
ſtood foremoſt in all attacks on the exorbitant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative

eloquence, and undaunted love of liberty,
which, from his intimate acquaintance with the

When civil convulſions proceeded to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
and it became requiſite for him to chuſe

embraced the defence of thoſe limited powers which

Still anxious, however, for his country, he ſeems

prieſts to begin hoſtilities againſt a people, whom

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0877500300:147"/>

who heard of the commotion in their neighbourhood,
inſtead of deſerting their habitations, and flocking

hopes of defending their property, and fell thus
ſeparately into the hands of their enemies. After
rapacity had fully exerted itſelf, cruelty, and the
moſt barbarous that ever, in any nation, was known,
or heard of, began its operations. An univerſal
maſſacre commenced of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> now defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
and paſſively reſigned to their inhuman foes.
No age, no ſex, no condition, was ſpared. The
wiſe, weeping for her butchered huſband, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
her helpleſs children, was pierced with
them, and periſhed by the ſame ſtroke. The old,
the young, the vigorous, the infirm, underwent
a like fate, and were confounded in one common

Deſtruction was, every where, let looſe, and met
the hunted victims at every turn. In vain was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

All connection was diſſolved; and death was dealt
by that hand, from which protection was implored

the aſtoniſhed <hi>Engliſh,</hi> living in profound

But death was the lighteſt puniſhment inflicted

Such was their frenzy, that the cattle which they

               <p>If any where a number aſſembled together, and,

by thoſe averſions, more deadly and incurable,
which aroſe from an enraged ſuperſtition. While
death finiſhed the ſufferings of each victim, the

cultivated fields, they ſtripped them of their very
clothes, and turned them out, naked and defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,

unuſual to the climate, and executed what the

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0877500300:151"/>
The roads were covered with crouds of
naked <hi>Engliſh,</hi> haſtening towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the
other cities which yet remained in the hands of
their countrymen. The feeble age of children,
the tender ſex of women, ſoon ſunk under the
multiplied rigours of cold and hunger. Here, the
huſband, bidding a final adieu to his expiring fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
envied them that fate which he himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
ſo ſoon to ſhare: there, the ſon, having
long ſupported his aged parent, with reluctance
obeyed his laſt commands, and, abandoning him
in this uttermoſt diſtreſs, reſerved himſelf to the
hopes of avenging that death, which all his efforts
could not prevent nor delay. The aſtoniſhing
greatneſs of the calamity deprived the ſufferers of
any relief from the view of companions in afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
With ſilent tears, or lamentable cries, they
hurried on through the hoſtile territories; and
found every heart, which was not ſteeled by native
barbarity, guarded by the more implacable furies
of miſtaken piety and religion.</p>
               <p>The ſaving of <hi>Dublin</hi> preſerved in <hi>Ireland</hi> the
remains of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name. The gates of that
city, though timorouſly opened, received the
wretched ſupplicants, and diſcovered to the view
a ſcene of human miſery beyond what any eye had
ever before beheld. Compaſſion ſeized the amazed
inhabitants, aggravated with the fear of like cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
while they obſerved the numerous foes,
without and within, which every where environed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0877500300:152"/>
them, and reflected on the weak reſources by which
they were themſelves ſupported. The more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of the unhappy fugitives, to the number of
three thouſand, were inliſted into three regiments:
the reſt were diſtributed into the houſes; and all
care was taken, by diet and warmth, to recruit
their feeble and torpid limbs. Diſeaſes of unknown
name and ſpecies, derived from theſe multiplied
diſtreſſes, ſeized many of them, and put a ſpeedy
period to their lives: others, having no leiſure to
reflect on their mighty loſs of friends and fortune,
curſed that being which they had ſaved. Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
themſelves to deſpair, refuſing all ſuccour,
they expired; without other conſolation, than that
of receiving among their countrymen the honours
of a grave, which to their ſlaughtered companions
had been denied by the inhuman barbarians.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0877500300:153"/>
which, whatever rudeneſs may ſometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

of nature and paſſion, that the compoſitions
poſſeſſed of it muſt for ever appear valuable to the
diſcerning part of mankind. The glaring figures
of diſcourſe, the pointed antitheſis, the unnatural
conceit, the jingle of words; ſuch falſe ornaments
were not employed by early writers, not becauſe
they were rejected, but becauſe they ſcarce ever
occurred to them. An eaſy unforced ſtrain of
ſentiment runs through their compoſitions; though
at the ſame time, amidſt the moſt elegant ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of thought and expreſſion, one is ſometimes
ſurpriſed to meet with a poor conceit, which had
preſented itſelf unſought for, and which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
had not acquired critical obſervation enough
to condemn. A bad taſte ſeizes with avidity theſe
frivolous beauties, and even perhaps a good taſte,
ere ſurfeited by them. They multiply every day
more and more in the faſhionable compoſitions:
nature and good-ſenſe are neglected; laboured or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
ſtudied and admired; and a total degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of ſtyle and language prepares the way for
barbariſm and ignorance. Hence the <hi>Aſiatic</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was found to depart ſo much from the ſimple

which is obſervable in many of the <hi>Roman</hi> writers;

without any inſtruction, either from the world or

repreſented as a poet, capable of furniſhing a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
entertainment to a refined or intelligent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
we muſt abate ſomewhat of this eulogy.
In his compoſitions, we regret that many irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,

frequently disfigure the animated and paſſionate
ſcenes intermixed with them; and, at the ſame

on account of their being ſurrounded with ſuch
deformities. A ſtriking peculiarity of ſentiment,
adapted to a ſingular character, he frequently hits,
as it were, by inſpiration; but a reaſonable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of thought he cannot, for any time, uphold.
Nervous and pictureſque expreſſions, as well as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
abound in him; but 'tis in vain we
look either for continued purity or ſimplicity of
diction. This total ignorance of all theatrical art
and conduct, however material a defect, yet, as it
affects the ſpectator rather than the reader, we can
more readily excuſe, than that want of taſte which
often prevails in his productions, and which gives
way, only by intervals, to the irradiation of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.
A great and fertile genius he certainly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed,

how dangerous it is to rely on theſe advantages

               <p>THE great glory of literature in this iſland
during the reign of <hi>James</hi> I. was my Lord <hi>Bacon.</hi>
Moſt of his performances were compoſed in <hi>Latin,</hi>
though he poſſeſſed neither the elegance of that,
nor of his native tongue. If we conſider the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of talents employed by this man, as a public
ſpeaker, a man of buſineſs, a wit, a courtier, a
companion, an author, a philoſopher, he is juſtly
the object of great admiration: if we conſider him
merely as an author and philoſopher, the light in
which we view him at preſent, though very eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable,
he was yet inferior to his cotemporary
<hi>Galileo,</hi> perhaps even to <hi>Kepler. Bacon</hi> pointed
out at a diſtance the road to true philoſophy: <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileo</hi>
both pointed it out to others, and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
conſiderable advances in it. The <hi>Engliſhman</hi>
was ignorant of geometry: the <hi>Florentine</hi> revived
that ſcience, excelled in it, and was the firſt who
applied it, together with experiment, to natural
philoſophy. The former rejected, with the moſt
poſitive diſdain, the ſyſtem of <hi>Copernicus:</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fortified it with new proofs, derived both from
reaſon and the ſenſes. <hi>Bacon</hi>'s ſtyle is ſtiff and
rigid: his wit, though often brilliant, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
unnatural and far-fetched; and he ſeems to
be the original of thoſe pointed ſimiles, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpun

of his dignity, or of his wiſdom; and though he
often indulged his facetious humour, he knew how
to temper it with diſcretion, and ever kept at a

courtiers. His ſuperior eloquence and judgment
would have given him an aſcendant, even had he
been born in a private ſtation; and his perſonal

the name of <hi>Beau-clerc,</hi> or the Scholar; but

monaſtic life, and paſſed their time wholly in the
faſhionable amuſements of hunting, gallantry, and
the pleaſures of the table. Their rival order, that
of St. <hi>John of Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe poverty had as
yet preſerved them from like corruption, ſtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
themſelves by their enterpriſes againſt
the infidels, and ſucceeded to all the popularity
which was loſt by the indolence and luxury of the
<hi>Templars.</hi> But though theſe cauſes had weakened
the foundation of this order, once ſo celebrated
and revered, the immediate ſource of their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
proceeded from the cruel and vindictive ſpirit
of <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> who, having entertained a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
diſguſt againſt ſome eminent <hi>Templars,</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to gratify at once his avidity and revenge,
by involving the whole order in one undiſtinguiſhed
ruin. On no better information, than that of two
Knights, condemned by their ſuperiors to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
impriſonment, for their vices and proſligacy,
he ordered, on one day, all the <hi>Templars</hi> of <hi>France</hi>
to be committed to priſon, and imputed to them
ſuch enormous and abſurd crimes, as are ſufficient
of themſelves to deſtroy all the credit of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
Beſides their being univerſally charged
with murder, robbery, and vices the moſt ſhocking
to nature; every one, it was pretended, whom
they received into their order, was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
our Saviour, to ſpit upon the croſs, and
to join to this impiety the ſuperſtition of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
a gilded head, which was ſecretly kept in
one of their houſes at <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> They alſo ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,

it was ſaid, every candidate, by ſuch infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
rites, as could ſerve to no other purpoſe,
than to degrade the order in his eyes, and deſtroy
for ever the authority of all his ſuperiors over him.
Above an hundred of theſe unhappy gentlemen
were put to the torture, in order to extort from
them a confeſſion of their guilt: the more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
periſhed in the hands of their tormentors:
ſeveral, to procure themſelves immediate eaſe in
the violence of their agonies, acknowledged what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was required of them: forged confeſſions were
imputed to others: and <hi>Philip,</hi> as if their guilt
were now certain, proceeded to a confiſcation of
all their treaſures. But no ſooner had the <hi>Templars</hi>
recovered from their tortures, than, preferring the
moſt cruel execution to a life with infamy, they
diſavowed their confeſſions, exclaimed againſt the
forgeries, juſtified the innocence of their order,
and appealed to all the gallant actions performed
by them, in ancient or latter times, as a full apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for their conduct. The barbarous tyrant,
enraged at this diſappointment, and thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
now engaged in honour to proceed to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ordered fifty-four of them, whom he branded
as relapſed heretics, to periſh by the puniſhment
of fire, in his capital: great numbers expired after
a like manner in other parts of the kingdom: and
when he found that the perſeverance of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
victims, in juſtifying to the laſt their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
had made deep impreſſion on the ſpectators,
he endeavoured to overcome the conſtancy of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0877500300:167"/>
                  <hi>Templars</hi> by new inhumanities. The Grand Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the order, <hi>John de Molay,</hi> and another great
officer, brother to the ſovereign of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> were
conducted to a ſcaffold, erected before the church
of <hi>Notre Dame,</hi> at <hi>Paris:</hi> a full pardon was offered
them on the one hand: the fire, deſtined for their
execution, was ſhewn to them on the other: theſe
gallant nobles ſtill perſiſted in the proteſtation of
their own innocence, and that of their order; and
were inſtantly hurried into the flames by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner.</p>
               <p>In all this barbarous injuſtice, <hi>Clement</hi> V. who
was the creature of <hi>Philip,</hi> and then reſided in
<hi>France,</hi> fully concurred; and, without examining
a witneſs, or making any enquiry into the truth
of facts, he ſummarily, by the plenitude of his
apoſtolic power, aboliſhed the whole order. The
<hi>Templars,</hi> all over <hi>Europe,</hi> were thrown into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
their conduct underwent a ſtrict ſcrutiny;
the power of their enemies ſtill purſued and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
them; but no where, except in <hi>France,</hi> were
the ſmalleſt traces of their guilt pretended to be
found. <hi>England</hi> ſent back an ample teſtimony of
their piety and morals; but as the order was now
annihilated, the Knights were diſtributed into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
convents, and their poſſeſſions were, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Pope, transferred to the order of St.

who had long ſerved at <hi>Tangiers,</hi> and had
contracted, from his habitudes with the <hi>Moors,</hi>
an inhumanity leſs known in <hi>European</hi> and free
countries. At his firſt entry into <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> he
hanged nineteen without the leaſt enquiry into the
merits of their cauſe. As if to make ſport with
death, he ordered a certain number to be executed,
while he and his company ſhould drink to the
King's health, or to the Queen's, or to Judge <hi>Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feries.</hi>
Obſerving their feet to ſhake, in the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of death, he cried, that he would give them
muſic to their dancing; and he immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the drums to beat, and the trumpets to
ſound. By way of experiment, he ordered one
man to be hung up three times, queſtioning him,
at every interval, whether he repented of his
crime? But the man obſtinately aſſerting, that,
notwithſtanding all the paſt, he would ſtill will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
engage in the ſame cauſe, <hi>Kirk</hi> ordered him
to be hung in chains. One ſtory commonly told
of him, is memorable for the treachery, as well as
barbarity, which attended it. A young maid
pleaded for the life of her brother, and flung her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at <hi>Kirk</hi>'s feet, armed with all the charms
which beauty and innocence, bathed in tears,
could beſtow upon her. The tyrant was inflamed
with deſire, not ſoftened into love or clemency.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0877500300:169"/>
He promiſed to grant her requeſt, provided that
ſhe, in her turn, would be equally compliant to
him. The maid yielded to the conditions: but
after ſhe had paſſed the night with him, the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
ſavage next morning ſhewed her from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
her brother, the darling object for whom ſhe
had ſacrificed her virtue, hanged on a gibbet,
which he had ſecretly ordered to be there erected
for his execution. Rage, and deſpair, and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
took poſſeſſion of her mind, and deprived
her for ever of her ſenſes. All the inhabitants of
that country, innocent as well as guilty, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

his own regiment, inſtructed by his example, and
encouraged by his exhortations, diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

By way of pleaſantry, he uſed to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

plead, that theſe criminals had been put into no

nor could any man be denominated a traitor, till
the ſentence of ſome legal court was paſſed upon
him; that it appeared not by any proof, that ſhe

before ſhe ventured upon any road, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
beaten, to examine it carefully, to enquire
whither it led, what dangers, difficulties, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
might poſſibly or probably occur in it.
In theſe deliberations ſhe uſually conſumed ſome
time; which delay was very diſpleaſing to Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
who was always inclined to hurry on, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much forethought or deliberation, in the firſt
road he met. Wiſdom and Virtue were inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
but Confidence one day, following his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0877500300:181"/>
nature, advanced a conſiderable way before
his guides and companions; and, not feeling any
want of their company, he never enquired after
them, nor ever met with them more. In like
manner, the other ſociety, though joined by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
diſagreed and ſeparated. As Folly ſaw very
little way before her, ſhe had nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
concerning the goodneſs of roads, nor
could give the preference to one above another;
and this want of reſolution was increaſed by Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
who, with her doubts and ſcruples, always
retarded the journey. This was a great annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to Vice, who loved not to hear of difficulties
and delays, and was never ſatisfied without his full
career, in whatever his inclinations led him to.
Folly, he knew, though ſhe hearkened to Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
would be eaſily managed when alone; and
therefore, as a vicious horſe throws his rider, he
openly beat away this controller of all his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and proceeded in his journey with Folly,
from whom he is inſeparable. Confidence and
Diffidence being, after this manner, both thrown
looſe from their reſpective companies, wandered
for ſome time, till at laſt chance led them at the
ſame time to one village. Confidence went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
up to the great houſe, which belonged to
Wealth, the lord of the village; and, without
ſtaying for a porter, intruded himſelf immediately
into the innermoſt apartments, where he found
Vice and Folly well received before him. He
joined the train, recommended himſelf very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0877500300:182"/>
to his landlord, and entered into ſuch familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with Vice, that he was enliſted in the ſame
company along with Folly. They were frequent
gueſts of Wealth, and from that moment inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Diffidence, in the mean time, not daring
to approach the great houſe, accepted of an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
from Poverty, one of the tenants; and, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the cottage, found Wiſdom and Virtue,
who, being repulſed by the landlord, had retired
thither. Virtue took compaſſion of her, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
found, from her temper, that ſhe would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
improve: ſo they admitted her into their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
Accordingly, by their means, ſhe altered
in a little time ſomewhat of her manner, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
much more amiable and engaging, was
now called by the name of Modeſty. As ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
has a greater effect than good, Confidence,
though more refractory to counſel and example,
degenerated ſo far by the ſociety of Vice and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as to paſs by the name of Impudence. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who ſaw theſe ſocieties as <hi>Jupiter</hi> firſt joined
them, and know nothing of theſe mutual deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are led into ſtrange miſtakes by thoſe,
means, and wherever they ſee Impudence, make
account of Virtue and Wiſdom, and wherever
they obſerve Modeſty call her attendants Vice
and Folly.</p>

               <head>OF THE STUDY OF HISTORY.</head>
               <p>THERE is nothing I would recommend more
earneſtly to my female readers than the Study of
Hiſtory, as an occupation, of all others, the beſt
ſuited both to their ſex and education; much more
inſtructive than their ordinary books of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and more entertaining than thoſe ſerious
compoſitions which are uſually to be found in
their cloſets. Among other important truths,
which they may learn from hiſtory, they may be
informed of two particulars, the knowledge of
which may contribute very much to their quiet
and repoſe; That our ſex, as well as theirs, are
far from being ſuch perfect creatures as they are
apt to imagine; and, That Love is not the only
paſſion that governs the male world, but is often
overcome by avarice, ambition, vanity, and a
thouſand other paſſions. Whether they be the
falſe repreſentations of mankind in thoſe two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
that endear romances and novels ſo much
so the fair ſex, I know not; but muſt confeſs, I
am ſorry to ſee them have ſuch an averſion to
matter of fact, and ſuch an appetite for falſehood.
I remember I was once deſired by a young beauty,
for whom I had ſome paſſion, to ſend her ſome
novels and romances for her amuſement in the
country; but was not ſo ungenerous as to take
the advantage which ſuch a courſe of reading
might have given me, being reſolved not to make
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0877500300:184"/>
uſe of poiſoned arms againſt her. I therefore ſent
her <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Lives, aſſuring her, at the ſame
time, that there was not a word of truth in them
from beginning to end. She peruſed them very
attentively till ſhe came to the Lives of <hi>Alexander</hi>
and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whoſe names ſhe had heard of by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
and then returned me the book, with many,
reproaches for deceiving her.</p>
               <p>I may indeed be told, that the fair ſex have no
ſuch averſion to hiſtory as I have repreſented, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it be <hi>ſecret</hi> hiſtory, and contain ſome memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
tranſaction proper to excite their curioſity.
But as I do not find that truth, which is the baſis
of hiſtory, is at all regarded in thoſe anecdotes,
I cannot admit of this as a proof of their paſſion
for that ſtudy. However this may be, I ſee not
why the ſame curioſity might not receive a more
proper direction, and lead them to deſire accounts
of thoſe who lived in paſt ages, as well as of their
contemporaries. What is it to <hi>Cleora,</hi> whether
<hi>Fulvia</hi> entertains a ſecret commerce of love with
<hi>Philander</hi> or not? Has ſhe not equal reaſon to be
pleaſed, when ſhe is informed, (what is whiſpered
about among hiſtorians) that <hi>Cato</hi>'s ſiſter had an
intrigue with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and palmed her ſon, <hi>Marcus
Brutus,</hi> upon her huſband for his own, though in
reality he was her gallant's? And are not the
loves of <hi>Meſſalina</hi> or <hi>Julia</hi> as proper ſubjects of
diſcourſe as any intrigue that this city has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
of late years?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0877500300:185"/>
But I know not whence it comes that I have
been thus ſeduced into a kind of raillery againſt
the ladies; unleſs, perhaps, it proceed from the
ſame cauſe that makes the perſon who is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of the company, be often the object of
their good-natured jeſts and pleaſantries. We are
pleaſed to addreſs ourſelves after any manner to a
perſon that is agreeable to us; and, at the ſame
time, preſume that nothing will be taken amiſs by
one who is ſecure of the good opinion and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of every one preſent. I ſhall now proceed to
handle my ſubject more ſeriouſly, and ſhall point
out the many advantages that flow from the Study
of Hiſtory, and ſhow how well ſuited it is to every
one, but particularly to thoſe who are debarred
the ſeverer ſtudies, by the tenderneſs of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and the weakneſs of their education.
The advantages found in hiſtory ſeem to be of
three kinds, as it amuſes the fancy, as it improves
the underſtanding, and as it ſtrengthens virtue.</p>
               <p>In reality, what more agreeable entertainment to
the mind, than to be tranſported into the remoteſt
ages of the world, and to obſerve human ſociety,
in its infancy, making the firſt faint eſſays towards
the arts and ſciences? To ſee the policy of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and the civility of converſation ref<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ning
by degrees, and every thing that is ornamental to
human life advancing towards its perfection? To
mark the riſe, progreſs, declenſion, and final ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
of the moſt flouriſhing empires; the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0877500300:186"/>
which contributed to their greatneſs, and the
vices which drew on their ruin? In ſhort, to ſee
all human race, from the beginning of time, paſs,
as it were, in review before us, appearing in their
true colours, without any of thoſe diſguiſes which,
during their life-time, ſo much perplexed the
judgments of the beholders? What ſpectacle can
be imagined ſo magnificent, ſo various, ſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting?
What amuſement, either of the ſenſes or
imagination, can be compared with it? Shall
thoſe trifling paſtimes, which engroſs ſo much of
our time, be preferred as more ſatisfactory, and
more ſit to engage our attention? How perverſe
muſt that taſte be, which is capable of ſo wrong a
choice of pleaſures!</p>
               <p>But hiſtory is a moſt improving part of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as well as an agreeable amuſement; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a great part of what we commonly call <hi>eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
and value ſo highly, is nothing but an
acquaintance with hiſtorical facts. An extenſive
knowledge of this kind belongs to Men of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
but I muſt think it an unpardonable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in perſons, of whatever ſex or condition, not
to be acquainted with the hiſtory of their own
country along with the hiſtories of ancient <hi>Greece</hi>
and <hi>Rome.</hi> A woman may behave herſelf with
good-manners, and have even ſome vivacity in her
turn of wit; but, where her mind is ſo unfurniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
'tis impoſſible her converſation can afford any
entertainment to men of ſenſe and reflection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0877500300:187"/>
I muſt add, that hiſtory is not only a valuable
part of knowledge, but opens the door to many
other parts of knowledge, and affords materials
to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the ſciences. And indeed, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the ſhortneſs of human life, and our limited
knowledge, even of what paſſes in our own time,
we muſt be ſenſible that we ſhould be for ever chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in underſtanding, were it not for this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which extends our experience to all paſt ages,
and to the moſt diſtant nations; making them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
as much to our improvement in wiſdom as
if they had actually lain under our obſervation.
A man acquainted with hiſtory may, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
be ſaid to have lived from the beginning of
the world, and to have been making continual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to his ſtock of knowledge in every cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</p>
               <p>There is alſo an advantage in that knowledge
which is acquired by hiſtory, above what is learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the practice of the world, that it brings us
acquainted with human affairs, without diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the leaſt from the moſt delicate ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of virtue. And, to tell the truth, I know
not any ſtudy or occupation ſo unexceptionable as
hiſtory in this particular. Poets can paint virtue
in the moſt charming colours; but, as they addreſs
themſelves entirely to the paſſions, they often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
advocates for vice. Even philoſophers are
apt to bewilder themſelves in the ſubtilty of their
ſpeculations; and we have ſeen ſome go ſo far as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0877500300:188"/>
to deny the reality of all moral diſtinctions. But
I think it a remark worthy the attention of the
ſpeculative reader, that the hiſtorians have been,
almoſt without exception, the true friends of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and have always repreſented it in its proper
colours, however they may have erred in their
judgments of particular perſons. <hi>Machiavel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
diſcovers a true ſentiment of virtue in his Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of <hi>Florence.</hi> When he talks as a politician,
in his general reaſonings, he conſiders poiſoning,
aſſaſſination, and perjury, as lawful arts of power;
but when he ſpeaks as an hiſtorian, in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
narrations, he ſhows ſo keen an indignation
againſt vice, and ſo warm an approbation of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
in many paſſages, that I could not forbear
applying to him that remark of <hi>Horace,</hi> That if
you chaſe away nature, though with never ſo great
indignity, ſhe will always return upon you. Nor
is this combination of hiſtorians in favour of virtue
at all difficult to be accounted for. When a man
of buſineſs enters into life and action, he is more
apt to conſider the characters of men as they have
relation to his intereſt than as they ſtand in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and has his judgment warped on every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
by the violence of his paſſion. When a
philoſopher contemplates characters and manners
in his cloſet, the general abſtract view of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
leaves the mind ſo cold und unmoved that the
ſentiments of nature have no room to play, and he
ſcarce feels the difference betwixt vice and virtue.
Hiſtory keeps in a juſt medium betwixt theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0877500300:189"/>
and places the objects in their true point
of view. The writers of hiſtory, as well as the
readers, are ſufficiently intereſted in the characters
and events, to have a lively ſentiment of blame or
praiſe; and, at the ſame time, have no particular
intereſt or concern to pervert their judgment.</p>

               <p>OUR old mother Earth once laid an indictment
againſt Avarice before the courts of heaven, for
her wicked and malicious counſel and advice, in
tempting, inducing, perſuading, and traiterouſly
ſeducing the children of the plaintiff to commit
the deteſtable crime of parricide upon her, and,
mangling her body, ranſack her very bowels for

the repetitions and ſynonymous terms, not to tire
our reader too much with our tale. Avarice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called before <hi>Jupiter</hi> to anſwer to this charge,
had not much to ſay in her own defence. The
injury was clearly proved upon her. The fact,
indeed, was notorious, and the injury had been
frequently repeated. When therefore the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff

ſentence in her favour; and his decree was to this
purpoſe, That ſince Dame Avarice, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,

the plaintiff, ſhe was hereby ordered to take that
treaſure of which ſhe had feloniouſly robbed the

they took from her.</p>

               <p>MANKIND were not, as at preſent, originally
divided into male and female; but each individual
was a compound of both ſexes, and was in himſelf
both Huſband and Wife, melted down into one
living creature. This union was doubtleſs very
entire, and the parts well adjuſted together, ſince
there ſubſiſted the moſt perfect harmony between
male and female, though obliged to continue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
companions. But ſo great was the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
flowing from this union, that the <hi>men-women</hi>
became inſolent on their proſperity, and rebelled
againſt the gods. To puniſh them for this teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>Jupiter</hi> could contrive no better expedient,
than to divorce the male part from the female,
and make two imperfect beings of the compound,
which was before ſo perfect. Hence the origin of
men and women, as diſtinct creatures. But, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
our diviſion, ſo lively is our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the happineſs enjoyed in our primaeval
ſtate, that we are never at reſt in the preſent. Each
of theſe halves is continually ſearching through
the whole ſpecies to find the other half, which
was broken from it: and when they meet, they
join again with the greateſt fondneſs and ſympathy.
But it often happens, that they are miſtaken in
this particular; that they take for their half what
no way correſponds to them; and that the parts
do not meet nor join in with each other, as is uſual
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0877500300:192"/>
with fractures. In this caſe, the union is ſoon,
diſſolved, and each part is ſet looſe again, to hunt
for its loſt half; joining itſelf to every one it meets,
by way of trial, and enjoying no reſt, till its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſympathy with its partner ſhews that it has at
laſt been ſucceſsful in its endeavours.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jupiter</hi> had ſeparated the male from the
female, and had quelled their pride and ambition
by ſo ſevere an operation, he could not but repent
him of the cruelty of his vengeance, and take
compaſſion on poor mortals, who were now become
incapable of any repoſe or tranquillity. Such
cravings, ſuch anxieties, ſuch neceſſities, aroſe,
as made them curſe their creation, and think ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
itſelf a puniſhment. In vain had they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to every other occupation and amuſement.
In vain did they ſeek after every pleaſure of ſenſe,
and every refinement of reaſon. Nothing could
fill that void, which they felt in their hearts, or
ſupply the loſs of their partner, who was ſo fatally
ſeparated from them. To remedy this diſorder,
and to beſtow ſome comfort, at leaſt, on human
race in their forlorn ſituation, <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſent down
<hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hymen</hi> to collect the broken halves of
human kind, and piece them together, in the beſt
manner poſſible. Theſe two deities found ſuch a
prompt diſpoſition in mankind to unite again in
their primitive ſtate, that they proceeded on their
work with wonderful ſucceſs for ſome time; till at
laſt, from many unlucky accidents, diſſenſion aroſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0877500300:193"/>
betwixt them. The chief counſellor and favourite
of <hi>Hymen</hi> was <hi>Care,</hi> who was continually filling his
patron's head with proſpects of futurity; a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
family, children, ſervants; ſo that little elſe
was regarded in all the matches <hi>they</hi> made. On
the other hand, <hi>Love</hi> had choſen <hi>Pleaſure</hi> for his
favourite, who was as pernicious a counſellor as
the other, and would never allow <hi>Love</hi> to look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the preſent momentary gratification, or the
ſatisfying of the prevailing inclination. Theſe
two favourites became, in a little time, irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
enemies, and made it their chief buſineſs
to undermine each other in all their undertakings.
No ſooner had <hi>Love</hi> fixed upon two halves, which
he was cementing together, and forming to a cloſe
union, but <hi>Care</hi> inſinuates himſelf, and, bringing
<hi>Hymen</hi> along with him, diſſolves the union pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by <hi>Love,</hi> and joins each half to ſome other
half, which he had provided for it. To be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
of this, <hi>Pleaſure</hi> creeps in upon a pair al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
joined by <hi>Hymen;</hi> and calling <hi>Love</hi> to his
aſſiſtance, they under-hand contrive to join each
half, by ſecret links, to halves which <hi>Hymen</hi> was
wholly unacquainted with. It was not long before
this quarrel was felt in its pernicious conſequences;
arid ſuch complaints aroſe before the throne of
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> that he was obliged to ſummon the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parties to appear before him, in order to give
an account of their proceedings. After hearing
the pleadings on both ſides, he ordered an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
reconcilement betwixt <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hymen,</hi> as the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0877500300:194"/>
only expedient for giving happineſs to mankind:
and that he might be ſure this reconcilement ſhould
be durable, he laid his ſtrict injunctions on them,
never to join any halves without conſulting their
favourites, <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and obtaining the
conſent of both to the conjunction. Where this
order is ſtrictly obſerved, the <hi>Androgyne</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Man-Woman,</note> is perfectly
reſtored, and human race enjoy the ſame happineſs

and an uncommon way of thinking, ſhe found
no difficulty either in forming or maintaining this
reſolution, and could not ſuſpect herſelf of ſuch
weakneſs, as ever to be induced, by any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to depart from it. She had, however, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
a ſtrong deſire of having a ſon, whoſe
education ſhe was reſolved to make the principal
concern of her life, and by that means ſupply the
place of thoſe other paſſions, which ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
for ever to renounce. She puſhed her phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
to ſuch an uncommon length, as to find
no contradiction betwixt ſuch a deſire and her
former reſolution; and accordingly looked about,
with great deliberation, to find, among all her
male acquaintance, one whoſe character and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
were agreeable to her, without being able to
ſatisfy herſelf on that head. At length, being in
the play-houſe one evening, ſhe ſees, in the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre,</hi>
a young man of a moſt engaging countenance
and modeſt deportment; and feels ſuch a pre-poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
in his favour, that ſhe had hopes this muſt
be the perſon ſhe had long ſought for in vain. She
immediately diſpatches a ſervant to him; deſiring
his company, at her lodgings, next morning. The
young man was over-joyed at the meſſage, and
could not command his ſatisfaction, upon receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch an advance from a lady of ſo great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0877500300:196"/>
reputation, and quality. He was, therefore,
much diſappointed, when he found a woman who
would allow him no freedoms, and, amidſt all her
obliging behaviour, confined and over-awed him
to the bounds of rational diſcourſe and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
She ſeemed, however, willing to commence
a friendſhip with him; and told him, that his
company would always be acceptable to her, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he had a leiſure hour to beſtow. He needed
not much intreaty to renew his viſits; being ſo
ſtruck with her wit and beauty, that he muſt have
been unhappy, had he been debarred her company.
Every converſation ſerved only the more to inflame
his paſſion, and gave him more occaſion to admire
her perſon and underſtanding, as well as to rejoice
in his own good fortune. He was not, however,
without anxiety, when he conſidered the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of their birth and fortune; nor was his
uneaſineſs allayed, even when he reflected on the
extraordinary manner in which their acquaintance
had commenced. Our philoſophical heroine, in
the mean time, diſcovered that her lover's perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
qualities did not belie his phyſiognomy; ſo
that, judging there was no occaſion for any farther
trial, ſhe takes a proper opportunity of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
to him her whole intention. Their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
continued for ſome time, till at laſt her
wiſhes were crowned, and ſhe was now mother of
a boy, who was to be the object of her future care
and concern. Gladly would ſhe have continued
her friendſhip with the father; but finding him
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0877500300:197"/>
too paſſionate a lover to remain within the bounds
of friendſhip, ſhe was obliged to put a violence
upon herſelf. She ſends him a letter, in which ſhe
had incloſed a bond of annuity for a thouſand
crowns; deſiring him, at the ſame time, never to
ſee her more, and to forget, if poſſible, all paſt
favours and familiarities. He was thunder-ſtruck
at receiving this meſſage; and, having tried, in
vain, all the arts that might win upon the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a woman, reſolved at laſt to attack her by
her <hi>foible.</hi> He commences a law-ſuit againſt her
before the parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> and claims his
ſon, whom he pretends a right to educate as he
pleaſed, according to the uſual maxims of the law
in ſuch caſes. She pleads, on the other hand,
their expreſs agreement before their commerce,
and pretends, that he had renounced all claim to
any offspring that might ariſe from their embraces.
It is not yet known, how the parliament will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
in this extraordinary caſe, which puzzles
all the lawyers, as much as it does the philoſophers.

character have been more earneſtly and openly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed,

having governed a learned and free nation for ſo

make a large library of what has been wrote for
and againſt him, and is the ſubject of above half
the paper that has been blotted in this nation
within theſe twenty years. I wiſh, for the honour
of our country, that any one character of him
had been drawn with ſuch <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
as to have ſome credit with poſterity, and to
ſhew, that our liberty has, once at leaſt, been
employed to good purpoſe. I am only afraid of
failing in the former quality of judgment: but if
it ſhould be ſo, 'tis but one page more thrown
away, after an hundred thouſand, upon the ſame
ſubject, that have periſhed, and become uſeleſs.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0877500300:199"/>
In the mean time, I ſhall flatter myſelf with the
pleaſing imagination, that the following character
will be adopted by future hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> Prime Miniſter of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi>
is a man of ability, not a genius; good-natured,
not virtuous; conſtant, not magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;
moderate, not equitable<note n="*" place="bottom">Moderate in the exerciſe of power, not equitable in engroſſing it.</note>. His virtues, in
ſome inſtances, are free from the allay of thoſe
vices which uſually accompany ſuch virtues: he is
a generous friend, without being a bitter enemy.
His vices, in other inſtances, are not compenſated
by thoſe virtues which are nearly allied to them:
his want of enterpriſe is not attended with fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
The private character of the man is better
than the public; his virtues more than his vices;
his fortune greater than his fame. With many
good qualities, he has incurred the public hatred:
with good capacity, he has not eſcaped ridicule.
He would have been eſteemed more worthy of his
high ſtation, had he never poſſeſſed it; and is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
qualified for the ſecond than for the firſt place
in any government. His miniſtry has been more
advantageous to his family than to the public,
better for this age than for poſterity, and more
pernicious by bad precedents than by real griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.
During his time, trade has flouriſhed,
liberty declined, and learning gone to ruin. As I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0877500300:200"/>
am a man, I love him; as I am a ſcholar, I hate
him; as I am a <hi>Briton,</hi> I calmly wiſh his fall.
And were I a Member of either Houſe, I would
give my vote for removing him from St. <hi>James</hi>'s;
but ſhould be glad to ſee him retire to <hi>Houghton-Hall,</hi>

               <p>MANY of the moſt diſtinguiſhed Tories, ſome
of thoſe who carried higheſt the doctrines of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
obedience and non-reſiſtance, were engaged in,
and the whole nation was ripe for, the Revolution.
The Whigs were zealous in the ſame cauſe; but
their zeal was not ſuch as, I think, it had been
ſome years before, a zeal without knowledge; I
mean, that it was better tempered, and more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
conducted. Though the King was not the
better for his experience, parties were. Both ſaw
their errors. The Tories ſtopped ſhort in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of a bad principle. The Whigs reformed the
abuſe of a good one. Both had ſacrificed their
country to their party. Both ſacrificed, on this
occaſion, their party to their country. When the
Tories and the Whigs were thus coalited, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtood no longer in need of any adventitious
help. If they did not refuſe the aſſiſtance of thoſe
who had weakened their cauſe more by the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
and fears, to which they gave both occaſion
and pretence, than they had ſtrengthened it by
their numbers, yet they ſuffered them to have no
influence in their counſels, no direction of their
conduct. The cauſe of liberty was no longer made

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of a party, by being ſet on ſuch a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
and puſhed in ſuch a manner, as one party
alone approved. The Revolution was plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to reſtore and ſecure our government, eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
and civil, on true foundations; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may happen to the King, there was no room
to expect any change of the conſtitution. There
were ſome, indeed, concerned in this great and
glorious undertaking, who had obſtinately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
or lightly taken up, the republican and
other whimſies, that reigned in the days of uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
and confuſion. If they could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
and it was no fault of theirs they did not,
the coalition of parties had been broken; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a revolution we might have had a civil
war; perhaps not even that ſad chance for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and liberty. But this leaven was ſo near
worn out, that it could neither corrupt, nor ſeem
any longer to corrupt, the maſs of the Whig
party. The party never had been Preſbyterians,
nor Republicans, any more than they had been
Quakers; any more than the Tory party had been
Papiſts, when, notwithſtanding their averſion to
Popery, they were undeniably under the accidental
influence of Popiſh councils. But even the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
were now rectified. The Revolution
was a fire which purged off the droſs of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and, the droſs being purged off, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be the ſame metal, and anſwered the
ſame ſtandard.</p>

               <head>THE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT ON
THE SPIRIT OF NATIONS.</head>
               <p>AS the natural diſpoſitions of men are altered,
and formed into different moral characters, by
education, ſo the ſpirit of a conſtitution of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which is confirmed, improved, and
ſtrengthened, by the courſe of events, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by thoſe of fruitleſs oppoſition, in a long
tract of time, will have a proportionable influence
on the reaſoning, the ſentiments, and the conduct,
of thoſe who are ſubject to it. A different ſpirit,
and contrary prejudices, may prevail for a time;
but the ſpirit and principles of the conſtitution
will prevail at laſt. If one be unnatural, and the
other abſurd, and that is the caſe of many govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
a vigorous exerciſe of power, ſignal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
ſignal puniſhments, and variety of other
ſecondary means, which in ſuch conſtitutions are
never wanting, will however maintain, as long as
they are employed, both the ſpirit and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
But if the ſpirit and principles of a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be agreeable to nature, and the true ends of
government, which is the caſe of the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> government, they want no
ſuch means to make them prevail. They not only
flouriſh without them, but they would fade and
die away with them. As liberty is nouriſhed and
ſupported by ſuch a ſpirit and ſuch principles, ſo
they are propagated by liberty. Truth and reaſon
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0877500300:213"/>
are often able to get the better of authority in
particular minds; but truth and reaſon, with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
on their ſide, will carry numbers, bear
down prejudices, and become the very genius of a
people. The progreſs they make is always ſure,
but ſometimes not obſervable by every eye. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
prejudices may ſeem to maintain themſelves
in vigour, and theſe prejudices may be kept up
long by paſſion and by artifice; but when truth
and reaſon continue to act without reſtraint, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſooner, or a little later, and often when this turn
is leaſt expected, the prejudices vaniſh at once,
and truth and reaſon triumph without any rival.</p>

               <head>THE CONSTITUTION AND GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT
DISTINGUISHED.</head>
               <p>IT may be aſked, perhaps, how men who are
friends to a government, can be enemies, at the
ſame time, to the conſtitution on which that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is founded? But the anſwer will be eaſy,
if we conſider theſe two things; firſt, the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
ſo often confounded in writing, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
always in converſation, between Conſtitution
and Government. By Conſtitution we mean, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we ſpeak with propriety and exactneſs, the
aſſemblage of laws, inſtitutions, and cuſtoms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from certain fixed principles of reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to certain fixed objects of public good, that
compoſe the general ſyſtem, according to which
the community hath agreed to be governed. By
Government we mean, whenever we ſpeak in the
ſame manner, that particular tenor of conduct,
which a chief magiſtrate, and inferior magiſtrates
under his direction and influence, hold in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of public affairs. We call this a Good
Government, when the execution of the laws, the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0877500300:215"/>
obſervation of the inſtitutions and cuſtoms, in
ſhort, the whole adminiſtration of public affairs,
is wiſely purſued, and with a ſtrict conformity to
the principles and objects of the conſtitution. We
call it a Bad Government, when it is adminiſtered
on other principles, and directed to other objects,
either wickedly or weakly, either by obtaining
new laws which want this conformity, or by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
old ones which had it; and when this is
done without law, or in open violation of the
laws, we term it a Tyrannical Government. In a
word, and to bring this home to our own caſe,
Conſtitution is the rule by which our Princes ought
to govern at all times; Government is that by
which they actually do govern at any particular
time. One may remain immutable; the other may,
and, as human nature is conſtituted, muſt vary.
One is the criterion by which we are to try the
other; for, ſurely, we have a right to do ſo; ſince,
if we are to live in ſubjection to the government
of our Kings, our Kings are to govern in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the conſtitution; and the conformity or
non-conformity of their government to it, preſcribes
the meaſure of our ſubmiſſion to them, according
to the principles of the Revolution, and of our
preſent ſettlement: in both of which, though ſome
remote regard war had to blood, yet the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the conſtitution manifeſtly determined the

a flower, but might prove a more effectual method;
and two or three hundred mercenaries in the two

               <p>As all government began, ſo all government
muſt end, with the people; tyrannical governments
by their virtue and courage, and even free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

indeed, makes it impoſſible to deſtroy liberty by

they may eaſily ſave themſelves: but, if the many
will concur with the few, if they will adviſedly

preſerve it, this no conſtitution can prevent. God

and a whole army of martyrs; and the gates
of hell have not hitherto prevailed againſt her:
ſo that, if a fatal reverſe is to happen, if ſervility

               <p>MY Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſays, that <hi>cunning is left-handed
or crooked wiſdom.</hi> I would rather ſay, that it is
a part, but the loweſt part, of wiſdom; employed
alone by ſome, becauſe they have not the other
parts to employ; and by ſome, becauſe it is as
much as they want within thoſe bounds of action
which they preſcribe to themſelves, and ſufficient
to the ends that they propoſe. The difference
ſeems to conſiſt in degree and application, rather
than in kind. Wiſdom is neither <hi>left-handed</hi> nor
<hi>crooked:</hi> but the heads of ſome men contain little,
and the hearts of others employ it wrong. To
uſe my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s own compariſon, the cunning
man knows how to pack the cards, the wiſe man
how to play the game better: but it would be of
no uſe to the firſt, to pack the cards, if his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſtopped here, and he had no ſkill in the
game; nor to the ſecond, to play the game better,
if he did not know how to pack the cards, that he

might unpack them by new ſhuffling. Inferior
wiſdom, or cunning, may get the better of folly;
but ſuperior wiſdom will get the better of cunning.
Wiſdom and cunning have often the ſame objects;
but a wiſe man will have more and greater in his
view. The leaſt will not fill his ſoul, nor ever
become the principal theme; but will be purſued
in ſubſerviency, in ſubordination at leaſt, to the
other. Wiſdom and cunning may employ ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

therefore avoided by him, in every poſſible caſe;
for ſimulation is put on, that we may look into

that are diſtant, as well as thoſe that are near, and
all their remote relations, and even their indirect

By trade and commerce we grew a rich and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

poor and impotent. As trade and commerce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich,
ſo they fortify our country. The ſea is our
barrier, ſhips are our fortreſſes, and the mariners,
that trade and commerce alone can furniſh, are the
garriſons to defend them. <hi>France</hi> lies under great
diſadvantages in trade and commerce, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of her government. Her advantages in ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are as great, at leaſt, as ours. Thoſe that
ariſe from the temper and character of her people
are a little different perhaps, and yet upon the
whole equivalent. Thoſe of her climate and her
ſoil are ſuperior to ours, and indeed to thoſe of
any <hi>European</hi> nation. The <hi>United Provinces</hi> have
the ſame advantages that we have in the nature of
their government, more perhaps in the temper and
character of their people; leſs, to be ſure, in their
ſituation, climate, and ſoil. But without deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into a longer detail of the advantages and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages
attending each of theſe nations, in
trade and commerce, it is ſufficient for my preſent
purpoſe to obſerve, that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſtands in a
certain middle between the other two, with regard
to <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>power</hi> ariſing from theſe ſprings.
A leſs, and a leſs conſtant, application to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of theſe may ſerve the ends of <hi>France;</hi>
a greater is neceſſary in this country; and a greater
ſtill in <hi>Holland.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> may improve their

power, by conſequence, as <hi>Europe</hi> is now conſtituted,
without the improvement of them, nor in any
degree but proportionably to this improvement.
The <hi>Dutch</hi> cannot ſubſiſt without them. They
bring wealth to other nations, and are neceſſary
to the well-being of them; but they ſupply the
<hi>Dutch</hi> with food and raiment, and are neceſſary
even to their being.</p>
               <p>The reſult of what has been ſaid, is, in general,
that the wealth and power of all nations depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in ſuch different circumſtances of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

intereſt; a good government, and therefore
the government of a patriot King, will be directed
conſtantly to make the moſt of every advantage
that nature has given, or art can procure, towards
the improvement of trade and commerce. And
this is one of the principal criterions, by which
we are to judge whether governors are in the true
intereſt of the people or not.</p>
               <p>It reſults, in particular, that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> might
improve her wealth and power in a proportion ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to that of any nation who can be deemed
her rival, if the advantages ſhe has were as wiſely
cultivated, as they will be in the reign of a patriot
King. To be convinced more thoroughly of this

               <p>OTHER characters might be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt
with this; the firſt <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
or the eldeſt <hi>Cato:</hi> and there will be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to a compariſon of ſuch citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> as
theſe were with Kings of the firſt magnitude. Now
the reputation of the firſt <hi>Scipio</hi> was not ſo clear
and uncontroverted in <hi>private</hi> as in <hi>public</hi> life; nor
was he allowed, by all, to be a man of ſuch ſevere
virtue as he affected, and as that age required.
<hi>Naevius</hi> was thought to mean him in ſome verſes

                  <hi>Gellius</hi> has preſerved: and <hi>Valerius Antias</hi> made no
ſcruple to aſſert, that, far from reſtoring the fair
<hi>Spaniard</hi> to her family, he debauched and kept her.
Notwithſtanding this, what authority did he not
maintain? In what eſteem and veneration did he
not live and die? With what panegyrics has not
the whole torrent of writers rolled down his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
even to theſe days? This could not have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
if the vice imputed to him had ſhewn itſelf
in any ſcandalous appearances, to eclipſe the luſtre
of the general, the conſul, or the citizen. The
ſame reflection might be extended to <hi>Cato,</hi> who
loved wine as well as <hi>Scipio</hi> loved women. Men did
not judge in the days of the elder <hi>Cato,</hi> perhaps,
as <hi>Seneca</hi> was ready to do in thoſe of the younger,
that drunkenneſs could be no crime if <hi>Cato</hi>
drank: but <hi>Cato</hi>'s paſſion, as well as that of <hi>Scipio,</hi>
was ſubdued and kept under by his public charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
His virtue warmed, inſtead of cooling, by
this indulgence to his genius or natural temper:
and one may gather from what <hi>Tully</hi> puts into his
mouth in the treatiſe concerning old-age, that even
his love of wine was rendered ſubſervient, inſtead
of doing hurt, to the meaſures he purſued in his
public character.</p>

haughty, was reſerved; and all he ſaid or did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be forethought and planned. His regard
to appearances was ſuch, that when his miſtreſs
was the wife of another man, and he had children

with the latter, in every apparent reſpect, as if he had
no miſtreſs at all. Thus he raiſed a great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he was revered by his ſubjects, and admired
by his neighbours: and this was due principally
to the art with which he managed appearances, ſo
as to ſet off his virtues, to diſguiſe his failings and

whole public conduct, and gave life and colour to
it. She did great things, and ſhe knew how to
ſet them off according to their full value, by her
manner of doing them. In her <hi>private behaviour</hi>
ſhe ſhewed great affability, ſhe deſcended even to

               <head>OF JAMES THE FIRST.</head>
               <p>HER ſucceſſor had no virtues to ſet off; but he
had failings and vices to conceal. He could not
conceal the latter; and, void of the former, he could
not compenſate for them. His failings and his
vices therefore ſtanding in full view, he paſſed for
a weak Prince and an ill Man; and fell into all the
contempt wherein his memory remains to this day.
The methods he took to preſerve himſelf from it,
ſerved but to confirm him in it. No man can keep
the decorum of manners in life, who is not free from
every kind of <hi>affectation,</hi> as it has been ſaid already:
but he who affects what he has no pretenſions to,
or what is improper to his character and rank
in the world, is guilty of moſt conſummate folly;
he becomes doubly ungracious, doubly indecent,
and quite ridiculous. <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, not having
one quality to conciliate the eſteem or affection of
his people to him, endeavoured to impoſe on their
underſtandings; and to create a reſpect for himſelf,
by ſpreading the moſt extravagant notions about
<hi>Kings</hi> in general, as if they were <hi>middle beings</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and other men, and by comparing the

                  </gap>nſearchable myſteries of their <hi>power</hi>
and <hi>prerogative</hi> to thoſe of the divine providence.
His <hi>language</hi> and his <hi>behaviour</hi> were commonly
ſuited to ſuch fooliſh pretenſions; and thus, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0877500300:244"/>
a claim to ſuch reſpect and ſubmiſſion as
were not due to him, he loſt a great part of what
was due to him. In ſhort he began at the wrong
end; for, though the ſhining qualities of the King
may cover, ſome failings and ſome vices that do not
grow up to ſtrong habits in the Man, yet muſt the
character of a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good King</hi> be founded in
that of a <hi>great</hi> and a <hi>good Man.</hi> A King who lives
out of the ſight of his ſubjects, or is never ſeen by
them except on his throne, can ſcarce be deſpiſed
as a Man, though he may be hated as a King. But
the King who lives more in their ſight, and more
under their obſervation, may be deſpiſed before he
is hated, and even without being hated. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to King <hi>James:</hi> a thouſand circumſtances
brought it to paſs, and none more than the <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
weakneſſes</hi> he had for his <hi>minions.</hi> He did not
endeavour to cure this contempt, and raiſe his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
only by affecting what he had no pretenſions
to, as in the former caſe; but he endeavoured like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
moſt vainly to do it by affecting what was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to his character and rank. He did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
indeed to diſguiſe his natural <hi>puſillanimity</hi>
and <hi>timidity</hi> under the maſk of a bully, whilſt he
was impoſed upon and inſulted by all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and above all by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
the ſcraps of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> affected to talk much,
figured in church controverſies, and put on all
the pedantic appearances of a ſcholar, whilſt he
neglected all thoſe of a great and good Man, as

affection? a King, in the temper of whoſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

empire and liberty are intimately mixed; co-exiſt
together inſeparably, and conſtitute one real eſſence?
What ſpectacle can be preſented to the view of the
mind ſo rare, ſo nearly divine, as a King poſſeſſed
of abſolute power, neither uſurped by fraud, nor
maintained by force, but the genuine effect of
eſteem, of confidence, and affection; the free gift
of <hi>Liberty,</hi> who finds her greateſt ſecurity in this
power, and would deſire no other if the Prince on

The true image of a free people, governed by a

the head and all the members are united by one
common intereſt, and animated by one common

have another, they will be ſoon borne down by
the ſuperiority of thoſe who have the ſame; and,
far from making a diviſion, they will but confirm
the union of the little ſtate.</p>
               <p>Faction is to party what the <hi>ſuperlative</hi> is to

               <p>Parties, even before they degenerate into abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

together for certain purpoſes, and certain intereſts,
which are not, or which are not allowed to be,

               <p>From the miſapplication of ſuperior parts to the

               <p>Superior talents, and ſuperior rank, among our

               <p>A life dedicated to the ſervice of our country

fail, it gives frequent opportunities to the people
to ſecure their intereſt themſelves, by mending
their choice: ſo that, as a bad king muſt ſtand in

Our conſtitution is not, like the ſchemes of ſome
politicians, a jumble of disjointed, incoherent
whimſies, but a noble and wiſe ſyſtem, the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
parts of which are ſo proportioned, and ſo
intimately connected, that a change in one begets
a change in the whole.</p>
               <p>A free people may be ſometimes betrayed; but
no people will betray themſelves, and ſacrifice their
liberty, unleſs they fall into a ſtate of univerſal
corruption; and, when they are once fallen into
ſuch a ſtate, they will be ſure to loſe what they
deſerve no longer to enjoy.</p>
               <p>Whatever political ſpeculations, inſtead of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring

               <p>THE love of hiſtory ſeems inſeparable from
human nature, becauſe it ſeems inſeparable from
ſelf-love. The ſame principle in this inſtance
carries us forward and backward, to future and to
paſt ages. We imagine that the things which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
us, muſt affect poſterity: this ſentiment runs
through mankind, from <hi>Caeſar</hi> down to the pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clerk
in <hi>Pope's</hi> Miſcellany. We are fond of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
as far as it is in our frail power, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of our own adventures, of thoſe of our own
time, and of thoſe that preceded it. Rude heaps
of ſtones have been raiſed, and ruder hymns have
been compoſed, for this purpoſe, by nations who
had not yet the uſe of arts and letters. To go no
further back, the triumphs of <hi>Odin</hi> were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in <hi>Runic</hi> ſongs, and the feats of our <hi>Britiſh</hi>
anceſtors were recorded in thoſe of their bards.
The ſavages of <hi>America</hi> have the ſame cuſtom at
this day: and long hiſtorical ballads of their hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and their wars are ſung at all their feſtivals.
There is no need of ſaying how this paſſion grows
among civilized nations, in proportion to the
means of gratifying it: but let us obſerve that the
ſame principle of nature directs us as ſtrongly, and
more generally as well as more early, to indulge
our own curioſity, inſtead of preparing to gratify
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0877500300:261"/>
that of others. The child hearkens with delight
to the tales of his nurſe; he learns to read, and he
devours with eagerneſs fabulous legends and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.
In riper years, he applies himſelf to hiſtory,
or to that which he takes for hiſtory, to authoriſed
romance: and even in age, the deſire of knowing
what has happened to other men, yields to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
alone of relating what has happened to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Thus hiſtory, true or falſe, ſpeaks to our
paſſions always. What pity is it, that even the
beſt ſhould ſpeak to our underſtandings ſo ſeldom!
That it does ſo, we have none to blame but our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Nature has done her part. She has opened
this ſtudy to every man who can read and think:
and what ſhe has made the moſt agreeable, reaſon
can make the moſt uſeful, application of our minds.
But if we conſult our reaſon, we ſhall be far from
following the examples of our fellow-creatures, in
this as in moſt other caſes, who are ſo proud of
being rational. We ſhall neither read to ſoothe
our indolence, nor to gratify our vanity: as little
ſhall we content ourſelves to drudge like gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians
and critics, that others may be able to
ſtudy, with greater eaſe and profit, like philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
and ſtateſmen: as little ſhall we affect the
ſlender merit of becoming great ſcholars at the
expence of groping all our lives in the dark mazes
of antiquity. All theſe miſtake the true drift of
ſtudy, and the true uſe of hiſtory. Nature gave
us curioſity to excite the induſtry of our minds;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0877500300:262"/>
but ſhe never intended it ſhould be made the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
much leſs the ſole, object of their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The true and proper object of this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is a conſtant improvement in private and in
public virtue. An application to any ſtudy, that
tends neither directly nor indirectly to make us
better men and better citizens, is at beſt but a
ſpecious and ingenious ſort of idleneſs, to uſe an
expreſſion of <hi>Tillotſon:</hi> and the knowledge we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
by it is a creditable kind of ignorance, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more. This creditable kind of ignorance is,
in my opinion, the whole benefit which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of men, even of the moſt learned, reap from
the ſtudy of hiſtory: and yet the ſtudy of hiſtory
ſeems to me, of all other, the moſt proper to train
us up to private and public virtue.</p>

               <p>THE ſchool of example is the world: and the
maſters of this ſchool are hiſtory and experience.
I am far from contending that the former is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to the latter. I think, upon the whole,
otherwiſe: but this I ſay, that the former is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to prepare us for the latter, and
to accompany us whilſt we are under the diſcipline
of the latter, that is, through the whole courſe of
our lives. No doubt, ſome few men may be quoted,
to whom nature gave what art and induſtry can
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0877500300:263"/>
give to no man. But ſuch examples will prove
nothing againſt me, becauſe I admit that the ſtudy
of hiſtory without experience is inſufficient, but
aſſert that experience itſelf is ſo without genius.
Genius is preferable to the other two; but I would
wiſh to find the three together: for how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

may acquire new light and heat as he proceeds in
his rapid courſe, certain it is that he will never
ſhine with the full luſtre, nor ſhed the full influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he is capable of, unleſs to his own experience
he adds the experience of other men and other ages.
Genius, without the improvement at leaſt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
is what comets once were thought to be,
a blazing meteor, irregular in his courſe, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
in his approach; of no uſe to any ſyſtem,
and able to deſtroy any. Mere ſons of earth, if
they have experience, without any knowledge of
the hiſtory of the world, are but half ſcholars in

ſometimes meddling and preſuming. The

is double. In ancient hiſtory, as we have ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
the examples are complete, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complete
in the courſe of experience. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the progreſſion, and the end appear, not of
particular reigns, much leſs of particular enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
or ſyſtems of policy alone, but of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of nations, of empires, and of all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſyſtems that have ſucceeded one another in
the courſe of their duration. In modern hiſtory,
the examples may be, and ſometimes are, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complete;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0877500300:268"/>
but they have this advantage when
they are ſo, that they ſerve to render complete the
examples of our own time. Experience is doubly
defective; we are born too late to ſee the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and we die too ſoon to ſee the end of many
things. Hiſtory ſupplies both theſe defects. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
hiſtory ſhews the cauſes, when experience
preſents the effects alone: and ancient hiſtory ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
us to gueſs at the effects, when experience
preſents the cauſes alone.</p>

               <p>WHAT now is education? that part, that
principal and moſt neglected part of it, I mean,
which tends to form the moral character? It is,
I think, an inſtitution deſigned to lead men from
their tender years, by precept and example, by
argument and authority, to the practice, and to
the habit of practiſing theſe rules. The ſtronger
our appetites, deſires, and paſſions are, the harder
indeed is the taſk of education; but, when the
efforts of education are proportioned to this
ſtrength, although our keeneſt appetites and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and our ruling paſſions, cannot be reduced
to a quiet and uniform ſubmiſſion, yet are not
their exceſſes aſſuaged? are not their abuſes and
miſapplications, in ſome degree, diverted or check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Though the pilot cannot lay the ſtorm, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
he carry the ſhip by his art better through it,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0877500300:269"/>
and often prevent the wreck that would always
happen without him? If <hi>Alexander,</hi> who loved
wine, and was naturally choleric, had been bred
under the ſeverity of <hi>Roman</hi> diſcipline, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
he would neither have made a bonfire of
<hi>Perſepolis</hi> for his whore, nor have killed his friend.
If <hi>Scipio,</hi> who was naturally given to women, for
which anecdote we have, if I miſtake not, the
authority of <hi>Polybius,</hi> as well as ſome verſes of
<hi>Naevius</hi> preſerved by <hi>A. Gellius,</hi> had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by <hi>Olympias</hi> at the court of <hi>Philip,</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
that he would have reſtored the beautiful
<hi>Spaniard.</hi> In ſhort, if the renowned <hi>Socrates</hi> had
not corrected nature by art, this firſt apoſtle of the
Gentiles had been a very profligate fellow by his
own confeſſion; for he was inclined to all the
vices <hi>Zopyrus</hi> imputed to him, as they ſay, on the
obſervation of his phyſiognomy.</p>
               <p>With him, therefore, who denies the effects of
education, it would be in vain to diſpute; and
with him who admits them, there can be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
concerning that ſhare which I aſcribe to the
ſtudy of hiſtory, in forming our moral characters,
and making us better men. The very perſons
who pretend that inclinations cannot be reſtrained,
nor habits corrected, againſt our natural bent,
would be the firſt perhaps to prove in certain caſes
the contrary. A fortune at court, or the favours
of a lady, have prevailed on many to conceal,
and they could not conceal without reſtraining,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0877500300:270"/>
which is one ſtep towards correcting, the vices
they were by nature addicted to the moſt. Shall
we imagine now, that the beauty of virtue and the

owe to others, which benefit fortune can neither
hinder nor take away, and the reaſonableneſs of
conforming ourſelves to the deſigns of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted

ſhall we imagine, I ſay, that all theſe are not
able to acquire the ſame power over thoſe who are

impreſſions on our minds, nor to illuſtrate nor to

this neceſſary authenticity and probability, there
is much diſcernment to be employed in the choice

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0877500300:271"/>
read, ſome are to be ſtudied, and ſome may be
neglected entirely, not only without detriment,
but with advantage. Some are the proper objects
of one man's curioſity, ſome of others, and ſome
of all men's; but all hiſtory is not an object of
curioſity for any man. He who improperly, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly,

of canine appetite: the curioſity of one, like the
hunger of the other, devours ravenouſly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtinction whatever falls in its way; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them digeſts. They heap crudity upon
crudity, and nouriſh and improve nothing but
their diſtemper. Some ſuch characters I have
known, though it is not the moſt common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
into which men are apt to fall. One of
them I knew in this country. He joined, to a
more than athletic ſtrength of body, a prodigious
memory, and to both a prodigious induſtry. He
had read almoſt conſtantly twelve or fourteen hours
a day, for five-and-twenty or thirty years; and
had heaped together as much learning as could
be crouded into an head. In the courſe of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him, I conſulted him once or
twice, not oftener; for I found this maſs of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of as little uſe to me as to the owner. The
man was communicative enough, but nothing was
diſtinct in his mind. How could it be otherwiſe?
he had never ſpared time to think; all was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in reading. His reaſon had not the merit
of common mechaniſm. When you preſs a watch,
or pull a clock, they anſwer your queſtion with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0877500300:272"/>
preciſion; for they repeat exactly the hour of the
day, and tell you neither more nor leſs than you
deſire to know. But when you aſked this man a
queſtion, he overwhelmed you by pouring forth
all that the ſeveral terms or words of your queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
recalled to his memory: and, if he omitted
any thing, it was that very thing to which the
ſenſe of the whole queſtion ſhould have led him
and confined him. To aſk him a queſtion, was
to wind up a ſpring in his memory, that rattled
on with vaſt rapidity, and confuſed noiſe, till the

much more likely other animals ſhould ſhare the

ſhare the divine reaſon, which is affirmed, But,
ſuppoſing our monopoly of reaſon, would not your

animal according to the purpoſe for which it was

To talk of abſtracting ourſelves from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

has no ſecond ſpring, no ſecond ſummer: you may

will be, that I think very differently from moſt

we have to do in this world. I think we have more
of one, and leſs of the other, than is commonly
ſuppoſed. Our want of time, and the ſhortneſs
of human life, are ſome of the principal common-place
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0877500300:276"/>
complaints, which we prefer againſt the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
order of things: they are the grumblings
of the vulgar, and the pathetic lamentations of the
philoſopher; but they are impertinent and impious
in both. The man of buſineſs deſpiſes the man of
pleaſure, for ſquandering his time away; the man
of pleaſure pities or laughs at the man of buſineſs,
for the ſame thing: and yet both concur ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly
and abſurdly to find fault with the <hi>Supreme
Being,</hi> for having given them ſo little time. The
philoſopher, who miſpends it very often as much
as the others, joins in the ſame cry, and authoriſes
this impiety. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> thought it extremely
hard to die at ninety, and to go out of the world
when he had juſt learned how to live in it. His
maſter <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> found fault with nature, for treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man in this reſpect worſe than ſeveral other
animals: both very unphiloſophically! and I love
<hi>Seneca</hi> the better for his quarrel with the <hi>Stagirite</hi>
on this head. We ſee, in ſo many inſtances, a juſt
proportion of things, according to their ſeveral
relations to one another, that philoſophy ſhould
lead us to conclude this proportion preſerved even
where we cannot diſcern it; inſtead of leading us
to conclude that it is not preſerved where we do
not diſcern it, or where we think that we ſee
the contrary. To conclude otherwiſe, is ſhocking
preſumption. It is to preſume that the ſyſtem of
the univerſe would have been more wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
if creatures of our low rank among intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
natures had been called to the councils of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0877500300:277"/>
the Moſt High; or that the Creator ought to mend
his work by the advice of the creature. That life
which ſeems to our ſelf-love ſo ſhort, when we
compare it with the ideas we frame of eternity, or
even with the duration of ſome other beings, will
appear ſufficient, upon a leſs partial view, to all
the ends of our creation, and of a juſt proportion
in the ſucceſſive courſe of generations. The term
itſelf is long: we render it ſhort; and the want
we complain of flows from our profuſion, not from
our poverty. We are all arrant ſpend thrifts; ſome
of us diſſipate our eſtates on the trifles, ſome on the
ſuperfluities, and then we all complain that we
want the neceſſaries, of life. The much greateſt
part never reclaim, but die bankrupts to God and
man. Others reclaim late; and they are apt to
imagine, when they make up their accounts and
ſee how their fund is diminiſhed, that they have not
enough remaining to live upon, becauſe they have not
the whole. But they deceive themſelves: they were
richer than they thought, and they are not yet poor.
If they huſband well the remainder, it will be
found ſufficient for all the neceſſaries, and for ſome
of the ſuperfluities, and trifles too perhaps, of
life: but then the former order of expence muſt be

               <p>HOW great a part of mankind bear poverty with
chearfulneſs, becauſe they have been bred in it,
and are accuſtomed to it! Shall we not be able to
acquire, by reaſon and by reflection, what the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
artiſan poſſeſſes by habit? Shall thoſe who have
ſo many advantages over him be ſlaves to wants
and neceſſities of which he is ignorant? The rich,
whoſe wanton appetites neither the produce of one
country, nor of one part of the world, can ſatisfy,
for whom the whole habitable globe is ranſacked,
for whom the caravans of the eaſt are continually
in march, and the remoteſt ſeas are covered with
ſhips; theſe pampered creatures, ſated with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity,
are often glad to inhabit an humble cot,
and to make an homely meal. They run for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0877500300:283"/>
into the arms of frugality. Madmen that
they are, to live always in fear of what they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wiſh for, and to fly from that life which they
find it luxury to imitate! Let us caſt our eyes
backwards on thoſe great men who lived in the ages
of virtue, of ſimplicity, of frugality; and let us
bluſh to think that we enjoy in baniſhment more
than they were maſters of in the midſt of their
glory, in the utmoſt affluence of their fortune.
Let us imagine that we behold a great dictator gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
audience to the <hi>Samnit?</hi> ambaſſadors, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
on the hearth his mean repaſt with the ſame
hand which had ſo often ſubdued the enemies of
the commonwealth, and borne the triumphal lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
to the Capitol. Let us remember that <hi>Plato</hi>
had but three ſervants, and that <hi>Zeno</hi> had none.
<hi>Socrates,</hi> the reformer of his country, was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
as <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> the arbiter of his
country, was buried, by contribution. While <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius
Regulus</hi> beat the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Afric,</hi> the
flight of his ploughman reduced his family to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs

became the public care. <hi>Scipio</hi> died without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

for ſure it was juſt that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould
once pay tribute to him, who had eſtabliſhed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
tribute on <hi>Carthage.</hi> After ſuch examples
ſhall we be afraid of poverty? ſhall we diſdain to be
adopted into a family which has ſo many illuſtrious
anceſtors? ſhall we complain of baniſhment for

               <p>THE darts of adverſe fortune are always level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at our heads. Some reach us; ſome graze
againſt us, and fly to wound our neighbours. Let
us therefore impoſe an equal temper on our minds,
and pay without murmuring the tribute which we
owe to humanity. The winter brings cold, and
we muſt freeze. The ſummer returns with heat,
and we muſt melt. The inclemency of the air
diſorders our health, and we muſt be ſick. Here
we are expoſed to wild beaſts, and there to men
more ſavage than the beaſts: and if we eſcape the
inconveniencies and dangers of the air and the
earth, there are perils by water and perils by fire.
This eſtabliſhed courſe of things it is not in our
power to change; but it is in our power to aſſume
ſuch a greatneſs of mind as becomes-wiſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

us ſubmit to this order; let us be perſuaded that
whatever does happen ought to happen, and never

has marked out to us: for it is not enough to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and he is but a bad ſoldier who ſighs, and
marches on with reluctancy. We muſt receive the
orders with ſpirit and chearfulneſs, and not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſlink out of the poſt which is aſſigned us in
this beautiful diſpoſition of things, whereof even
our ſufferings make a neceſſary part. Let us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs

               <head>PHILOSOPHY THE ONLY REMEDY TO
A MIND DISEASED.</head>
               <p>ONE conſiderable advantage that ariſes from
philoſophy, conſiſts in the ſovereign antidote
which it affords to ſuperſtition and falſe religion.
All other remedies againſt that peſtilent diſtemper
are vain, or at leaſt uncertain. Plain good ſenſe
and the practice of the world, which alone ſerve
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0877500300:287"/>
moſt purpoſes of life, are here found ineffectual:
hiſtory, as well as daily experience, furniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of men endowed with the ſtrongeſt capacity
for buſineſs and affairs, who have all their lives
crouched under ſlavery to the groſſeſt ſuperſtition.
Even gaiety and ſweetneſs of temper, which infuſe
a balm into every other wound, afford no remedy
to ſo virulent a poiſon; as we may particularly
obſerve of the fair ſex, who, though commonly
poſſeſſed of theſe rich preſents of nature, feel
many of their joys blaſted by this importunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder.
But, when ſound Philoſophy has once
gained poſſeſſion of the mind, ſuperſtition is effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
excluded; and one may fairly affirm, that
her triumph over this enemy is more complete than
over moſt of the vices and imperfections incident
to human nature. Love or anger, ambition or
avarice, have their root in the temper and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which the ſoundeſt reaſon is ſcarce ever able
fully to correct; but ſuperſtition, being founded
on falſe opinion, muſt immediately vaniſh when
true philoſophy has inſpired juſter ſentiments of
ſuperior powers. The conteſt is here more equal
between the diſtemper and the medicine, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can hinder the latter from proving effectual,
but its being falſe and ſophiſticated.</p>
               <p>It will here be ſuperfluous to magnify the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of philoſophy by diſplaying the pernicious
tendency of that vice of which it cures the human
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0877500300:288"/>
mind. The ſuperſtitious man, ſays <hi>Tully,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">

even ſleep itſelf, which baniſhes all other cares of
unhappy mortals, affords to him matter of new
terror; while he examines his dreams, and finds,
in thoſe viſions of the night, prognoſtications of
future calamities. I may add, that though death
alone can put a full period to his miſery, he dares
not fly to this refuge, but ſtill prolongs a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
exiſtence, from a vain fear left he offend his
Maker, by uſing the power with which that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent

of God and nature are raviſhed from us by this

               <p>A MAN who retires from life does no harm to

reciprocal. I receive the benefits of ſociety,
and therefore ought to promote its intereſts; but
when I withdraw myſelf altogether from ſociety,
can I be bound any longer? But, allowing that
our obligations to do good were perpetual, they
have certainly ſome bounds; I am not obliged to
do a ſmall good to ſociety at the expence of a
great harm to myſelf. Why then ſhould I prolong
a miſerable exiſtence, becauſe of ſome frivolous
advantage which the public may perhaps receive
from me? If, upon account of age and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
I may lawfully reſign any office, and employ
my time altogether in fencing againſt theſe cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and alleviating as much as poſſible the
miſeries of my future life; why may I not cut
ſhort theſe miſeries at once by an action which is
no more prejudicial to ſociety? But ſuppoſe that
it is no longer in my power to promote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of ſociety, ſuppoſe that I am a burthen to
it, ſuppoſe that my life hinders ſome perſon from
being much more uſeful to ſociety; in ſuch caſes,
my reſignation of life muſt not only be innocent,
