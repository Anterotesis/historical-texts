            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the <hi>Fraud</hi> made uſe of by <hi>Inſolvents</hi> to bring themſelves within the Reach of the Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> with ſome Limitations; humbly offered to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of, in order (not to prevent an Act of Favour to real <hi>Inſolvents,</hi> but) to prevent the Abuſe of it by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Objects.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT is no wonder, if after ſo many Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions from the ſeveral Priſons almoſt over the whole Kingdom, and ſuch horrid <hi>Cruelties</hi> and Inhumanities, as appears to have been practiſed by ſome Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, eſpecially by the <hi>Warden of the Fleet</hi> and his <hi>Agents,</hi> upon ſeveral unfortunate Gentlemen who have fallen into their Hands; I ſay, 'tis no wonder if a Bill for Relief of Priſoners is become very popular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1213100900:5"/>By how much the ill Uſage of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who are thus abuſed by the <hi>Keepers of Priſons,</hi> ſhocks the tender and charitable Part in every Man's Breaſt; by ſo much the Caſe of the <hi>Priſoners,</hi> even of thoſe who have not been uſed ill, prevails upon the <hi>Publick</hi> in favour of the GRACE deſir'd.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall one Word be ſaid, or one Thought ſuggeſted, in this Tract in Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the <hi>Charitable</hi> Intention of the Houſe, or any way to leſſen the good and generous Diſpoſition of any Perſon whatever, whether in the Legiſlature, or out of it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards promoting ſo good a Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Far leſs</hi> ſhall I take one Step, or ſpeak one Word, that ſo much as looks like a Plea for the <hi>Cruelty</hi> and Inhumanity of <hi>Jaylors</hi> and Priſon-keepers; their Conduct in moſt, if not in all the Jails in <hi>England,</hi> calls aloud for a like Inſpection of Authority and for Juſtice upon the Perſons, as well as a ſevere Cenſure of the Practiſes of the Delinquents, in order to have that rigid, tho' neceſſary Part of the Law, call'd <hi>Impriſonment for Debt,</hi> be executed with <hi>Humanity</hi> and with Equity, according to the natural Rights of the Unfortunate, as Men; and according to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1213100900:6"/>
their <hi>legal</hi> Rights as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> which it is evident has not been obſerv'd hitherto.</p>
            <p>And to conclude this Part; <hi>leaſt of all</hi> ſhall I ſay one Word here in behalf of the Perſons at this time detected openly in the <hi>Cruelties,</hi> Inhumanities and Extortions, which they have practis'd upon the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Gentlemen who have fallen into their Hands: I do not ſee they merit the leaſt <hi>Favour</hi> from their Country; they have acted a <hi>dreadful Part,</hi> and they are in Hands, which I doubt not will have more <hi>Mercy</hi> than they have ſhewn to the Miſerable, who have been under their Power; and tho' I ſhall not, on the other hand, prompt or puſh their <hi>Misfortune,</hi> yet this I may ſay without any Prejudice or Injury to them, that I hope they ſhall have ſuch Juſtice, as will effectually diſable them, and warn all others (of that <hi>rough</hi> Employment) from the <hi>like</hi> Practices.</p>
            <p>Having laid down theſe <hi>Poſtulata,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prevent any prejudging my Deſign in this Work, or raiſing a <hi>popular</hi> Clamour, as if it was intended to leſſen the intended <hi>Grace</hi> of the Government or Legiſlature, and to prevent the <hi>Deliverance</hi> of Priſoners; I ſhall with the more freedom lay down ſome Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1213100900:7"/>
which, as they occur to me on this Occaſion, ſhall be worth the Conſideration of the Legiſlature, not to lye as <hi>Obſtructions</hi> in the way of the intended Bill, as a Reaſon <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> but that the Parliament, taking them into their Hands, and <hi>approving</hi> or <hi>diſapproving</hi> them, as they ſhall appear <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,</hi> may find out ſuch <hi>proper Remedies</hi> as to their great Wiſdom ſhall ſeem meet.</p>
            <p>Having thus, as I hope, remov'd the Prejudices which might lye againſt my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Deſign, I muſt alſo ſpeak a Word or two, very briefly, to remove if poſſible a popular Objection (at leaſt as it is uſed in the Mouths of ſome who are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concern'd in that part) namely, that it is <hi>unchriſtian</hi> and inhuman, and inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with a <hi>generous</hi> Nation abhorring Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as <hi>England</hi> profeſſes to be, to confine poor miſerable People in <hi>Priſon</hi> for Debt, eſpecially ſuch as have nothing to pay.</p>
            <p>As to the latter Part, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>confining</hi> People in Priſon who have <hi>nothing</hi> to pay, I come readily into that part, and in doing ſo I confirm what I have ſaid above, that I am not writing in order to intercept the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Grace</hi> of the Parliament to the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.</hi> The honeſt Debtor willing to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1213100900:8"/>
pay, but <hi>unable</hi>; and willing to pay as far as he is <hi>able,</hi> and ready to give all reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Satisfaction, ſuch as the Parliament may direct, that he is ſo unable, is certainly an <hi>Object</hi> recommending it ſelf to the <hi>Charity</hi> and Compaſſion of the whole Nation; and whatever intervenes by the Fraud of others, theſe, and theſe only, are allow'd to be the Perſons for whom the <hi>Parliamentary Grace</hi> which has been ſettled, and extended in ſo many Acts of Parliament already paſs'd, has been <hi>intended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That very great Numbers of <hi>Fraudulent,</hi> unqualify'd, wicked, and diſhoneſt People have formerly receiv'd the Benefit of the like <hi>Grace</hi> by the Help of <hi>falſe Oaths,</hi> unjuſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, Connivance of Jailors, Bribery and Corruption of many kinds, has been loudly complain'd of, and I doubt is much eaſier to prove than to prevent; and not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as I have ſaid, to be any ways a Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the Relief of the <hi>honeſt</hi> and real Objects of <hi>Grace,</hi> who are indeed within the Intention of the Act, I cover all that Part with ſaying, Better <hi>Ten</hi> diſhoneſt Debtors <hi>eſcape,</hi> than that <hi>one</hi> real Object of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Good</hi> ſhould <hi>periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1213100900:9"/>Yet I humbly propoſe it, as a Thing worthy the Conſideration of the <hi>Britiſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> whether it is any Way probable, that there can be ſuch a Number of miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſolvents in one Year, and that of but the <hi>loweſt</hi> Claſs too; namely, not owing above 100<hi>l.</hi> to any one Perſon, and all act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually Priſoners, as have preſented themſelves yearly to the Magiſtrates, to be diſcharged by the <hi>Grace</hi> of Parliament, for theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Years paſt?</p>
            <p>If it is true, as common <hi>Fame</hi> ſays it is, that notwithſtanding there was an Act for Delivering ſuch <hi>Priſoners</hi> but <hi>two</hi> Years paſt, there are at this Time near ninety Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch <hi>Inſolvents,</hi> now on the Books of the ſeveral <hi>Jails</hi> in this Kingdom; I ſay, if this is <hi>true,</hi> is it rational to believe, that theſe are all really and fairly Priſoners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Intent and Meaning of the <hi>intended Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be a noble Undertaking, and in my Opinion well worth the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, tho' it took up a good Part of a <hi>Seſſion,</hi> to find out ſome effectual Means to <hi>ſeparate between the Sheep and the Goats,</hi> (ſpeaking of that Alluſion with due Regard) in this Caſe; and to diſcover, expoſe, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1213100900:10"/>
puniſh the <hi>Frauds</hi> which are put upon the NATION in this Affair.</p>
            <p>It is true, the People are deſpicable; I mean, the <hi>Guilty</hi>; the Debts they lye for not large, at leaſt not to particular Men, and ſome may ſuggeſt that it is not worth Notice; but I reply, the Number is great, ſurprizingly great, and the Injury to Trade is very <hi>conſiderable,</hi> nor is the Matter ſmall among <hi>Tradeſmen,</hi> tho' the Debts (as above) are not ſingly large. For as many of theſe <hi>Inſolvents</hi> frequently fall within the Compaſs of one and the ſame Shopkeeper, it very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falls heavy; and as theſe <hi>fraudulent</hi> Debtors boldly run into Mens Books, with a Dependance upon ſuch <hi>Acts of Grace,</hi> and with an evident Deſign to cheat and defraud their Creditors, and this <hi>ſeveral</hi> Times over, ſuch People are, I think, very far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Debtors who deſerve Compaſſion, or within the Intent and Meaning of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary</hi> Grace.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe they are greatly injurious to Trade in general, as they <hi>ruin innocent</hi> Tradeſmen by their Knavery; many Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men having had thirty to fifty ſuch Inſolvents diſcharged by <hi>one Act,</hi> tho' they were never
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1213100900:11"/>
put in Priſon, or ſo much ar arreſted at their Suit, or for any Part of their Debt.</p>
            <p>The uſual <hi>Practice</hi> of theſe People has been to run themſelves into the <hi>Tradeſmens Books,</hi> as it is called, in as many particular and different Places as poſſible; always tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Care that it be for ſmall Sums, within the uſual Reſtraint of the <hi>Acts of Grace</hi>; and then when the expected <hi>Favour</hi> is in Proſpect, get themſelves arreſted, and put in Priſon, or turn'd over by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> ſo to be within the Reach of the Law, and then all the other <hi>Creditors,</hi> who have never offered them the <hi>leaſt</hi> Violence, are paid with a SUMMONS.</p>
            <p>Others by <hi>Corruption</hi> of Jailors, and by <hi>Bribery,</hi> have obtained thoſe Jailors to own them as <hi>Priſoners in Cuſtody,</hi> tho' not <hi>really</hi> ſo, for a certain antedated Time, ſo as to be brought within the Reach of the Act.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Perjury,</hi> what <hi>Forgery,</hi> what foul Things are practiſed under this Head, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Inſpection of the like Authority as lately detected the <hi>Frauds</hi> of the <hi>Fleet-priſon</hi>; a Committee, who are above the Reach of <hi>Fraud</hi> or <hi>Corruption</hi> themſelves, and fully qualified to ſearch thoſe <hi>Deeds of</hi>

               <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to the Bottom; indeed it ſeems to be reſerv'd to a Houſe of Commons, and to them only.</p>
            <p>It was the Saying of a known and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Writer, that no Man ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in Print of any publick Grievance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at the ſame Time he propoſed alſo the Remedies; I ſhall take the Hint, and offer ſomething to the Purpoſe in this Caſe, that I may diſmiſs it as I go:<list>
                  <item>I. It would go a great Way towards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting this Miſchief, if it was provided in the <hi>Act,</hi> that no <hi>Inſolvent</hi> ſhould claim the Benefit <hi>twice</hi> over; it having been frequent to have them take <hi>new Credit,</hi> after their having been once <hi>diſcharged,</hi> ſeeking out new Places of Abode, and new Creditors, who, upon a Variety of Pretences, they inſinuate themſelves ſo far into, as to get Credit with them, their former Circumſtances not being known.</item>
                  <item>II. That none ſhould claim the Benefit of ſuch an <hi>Act,</hi> who had <hi>run</hi> from their <hi>Bail,</hi> made <hi>Eſcapes</hi> from Officers or Priſon-keepers upon their Parole, or that had committed any notorious <hi>Fraud</hi>

puniſhable by Law, or that had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Credit upon Promiſe and expreſs Conditions (before two or more Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes who ſhall atteſt the ſame) not to claim or take the Benefit of any ſuch <hi>Act of Grace.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. That none ſhould claim ſuch <hi>Benefit</hi> who ſhall conceal any of their Goods and Effects from their Creditors, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their having made Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit as the Law directs, as in the Caſe of a Bankrupt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Proviſo's, together with a <hi>New Method</hi> to be taken, to limit and reſtrain the <hi>Priſon-keepers,</hi> to prevent their keeping Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners on their Books after they have been <hi>diſcharged, antedating</hi> their Commitments, and giving <hi>fraudulent</hi> Certificates of their being <hi>Priſoners,</hi> when really they were not; I ſay theſe Methods, and ſuch as theſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the farther Direction and Improvement of the Legiſlature, I perſwade myſelf would go a great way to prevent the Abuſe of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Grace,</hi> and to make the future <hi>Acts for Relief of Inſolvents</hi> effectually and truly, merciful and good, and the honeſt <hi>poor</hi> Priſoner, nobody repining at his Relief, would be deliver'd; the <hi>knaviſh</hi> deſigning

Debtor remaining, <hi>as he ought to do,</hi> where the Law directs.</p>
            <p>This leads me to enter a little into the Queſtion ſo much inſiſted on by ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>no Man ſhould be put in Priſon for Debt.</hi>

            <p>It is true, that this <hi>Doctrine</hi> has many Advocates, and ſome have puſhed it ſo far, as to think the contrary Opinion <hi>cruel</hi> and unchriſtian; but I ſhall enquire more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly into it in the next Part.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I take this Occaſion to repeat again what I hinted at before, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this is ſo far from <hi>impeaching</hi> the common Charity, and the Compaſſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation to Priſoners, that it prompts and recommends it by the meer Nature of the Thing; for when I argue againſt the Knavery of the Debtor, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf a <hi>voluntary</hi> Priſoner, on purpoſe to defraud and delude his <hi>Creditors,</hi> it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follows that the Priſons ſhould be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from all ſuch voluntary, fraudulent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and thoſe that remain would be the more real and unexceptionable Objects of the National <hi>Grace.</hi>

            <head>PART II.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Of the Neceſſity of Preſerving to the Creditor the Right of arreſting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning the <hi>Perſon</hi> of his Debtor; and how the Petty Credit given in all Retail Trade, and which is eſſential to the Support of our whole <hi>Commerce,</hi> depends upon it.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Believe it will not be called <hi>begging the Queſtion</hi> to lay it down as a <hi>Foundation,</hi> That as there is a greater Trade carried on in <hi>England</hi> than in any other Nation in <hi>Europe</hi>; ſo there is a larger Perſonal Credit given in Trade here than in any other Nation, not in <hi>Europe</hi> only, but in the whole World.</p>
            <p>There are ſo many <hi>Evidences</hi> of the firſt, and ſo many Authors have written on that Subject, that I need only refer my Reader to them; and the laſt is evident to every
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1213100900:17"/>
MERCHANT now in Trade, who ſees with the leaſt Obſervation what Difference there is between the way of Trading here, and the like way of Trading in <hi>Foreign</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and between the Credit given in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Some would make it a Queſtion, <hi>tho' I think it is no Queſtion,</hi> whether the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Trade is the Cauſe of giving this <hi>large Credit,</hi> or that the giving this large Credit is the Cauſe of the <hi>Greatneſs of our Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay there is no room to debate this Part; the latter is evident to Demonſtration, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the giving ſuch large Credit is the true Spring of the Greatneſs of our Trade: This appears by comparing the Bulk of the Trade in this Kingdom with the Bulk of our <hi>Current Stock</hi> in Trade. If no <hi>Credit</hi> was given, the Trade could not go beyond the <hi>Stock</hi>; it is true, it might go beyond the Current Coin, becauſe ſome Trade may be carry'd on by Barter, or exchanging one kind of Goods for another, without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of any <hi>Medium</hi> (which is Money) But no Trade can go beyond the <hi>Stock</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Credit,</hi> becauſe one Value muſt always be deliver'd for another, and they muſt be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1213100900:18"/>
always equal too, otherwiſe the Exchange is not equal, nor the Payment compleat.</p>
            <p>But in Credit the Caſe is quite different; for here the Seller delivers his Goods (which are a <hi>real Value</hi>) to the Buyer on his Note for Payment, or perhaps on his Verbal Promiſe, either of which, is an <hi>imaginary Value</hi> only; in a Word, the <hi>Fame</hi> or Reputation of a Buyer is put into the <hi>Scale of Commerce</hi> with the <hi>real</hi> Value and Subſtance of the Seller, and the one is deliver'd for the other: the Account in the Tradeſman's Ledger ſtands as a Regiſter of the Caſe; the Buyer ſtands Debtor on one ſide for the Value of the Goods ſold and deliver'd to him againſt an open <hi>Blank</hi> on the contrary ſide, to be fill'd up to his <hi>Creditor</hi> when he pays the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>By this ſtrange thing call'd <hi>Credit,</hi> all the mighty Wonders of an exalted Commerce are perform'd; a Tradeſman beginning with a Thouſand Pound Caſh, and a good Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſhall ſtore his Shop or Warehouſe with 5000<hi>l.</hi> in Goods, and may trade for 10000, nay for 20000<hi>l. per Annum</hi>; and ſo long as he manages <hi>prudently,</hi> pays cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and keeps up his Reputation, ſhall run almoſt what Length he pleaſes in his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1213100900:19"/>
Trade, ſo much greater a Stroke in Trade does his <hi>Character</hi> furniſh to him, than his <hi>Caſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Foot of this very Article call'd <hi>Credit,</hi> as a private Man may trade for 10000<hi>l. per Annum</hi> with but 1000<hi>l.</hi> Stock, ſo if the Stock of the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Trade of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> be, as ſome inſiſt, Ten Millions, the Trade may actually return a Hundred Millions of Pounds Sterling in a Year; an <hi>immenſe</hi> Sum, but not at all <hi>improbable</hi> to be true, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps within Compaſs too.</p>
            <p>But to bring it down to the Subject: Take the Credit given in ſmaller Articles; I mean, in <hi>retailing</hi> Goods to the <hi>laſt</hi> Conſumer: This is what I call <hi>petty Credit,</hi> and is the particular thing which fills our Jails with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent</hi> Priſoners. Even this <hi>petty Credit</hi> is, though ſmall in the particular, immenſely great in the general; and tho' it does not <hi>encreaſe</hi> the Stock of the Retailer, it certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does <hi>encreaſe</hi> his Trade, and cauſes him to ſell a great deal more Goods than otherwiſe he would find Cuſtomers for.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Wholeſale</hi> Dealer truſts or gives Credit to the <hi>Retailer,</hi> and thereby encreaſes <hi>his Stock</hi> (for Credit in Trade is Stock in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1213100900:20"/>
Trade) the <hi>Retailer</hi> gives Credit to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umer,</hi> and thereby increaſes <hi>his Sale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now upon what Foundation is all this Credit given? The <hi>Retailer,</hi> being a <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len-Draper,</hi> truſts his Neighbour with a Suit of Clothes; how comes he to do it? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Man has no extraordinary Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; well but, ſays the <hi>Retailer,</hi> he is a Tradeſman as well as I, and he muſt pay me, or he ſhall not be able to ſtand at his Shop Door, or ſit behind his <hi>Counter,</hi> for I will <hi>arreſt</hi> him and make him pay me; and upon this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Arreſting the Debtor,</hi> and carrying him to <hi>Priſon,</hi> or whether he is carry'd to <hi>Priſon</hi> or no, the expoſing him, diſgracing him, and ruining his Credit; I ſay, upon this is founded the Freedom of the Tradeſman to truſt him.</p>
            <p>If you deſtroy this Power of <hi>Coercion,</hi> you deſtroy the <hi>Credit in Trade</hi>; for if the Man cannot be <hi>credited,</hi> he cannot <hi>buy</hi>; and if the Tradeſman cannot <hi>arreſt</hi> him, he will not ſell.</p>
            <p>This particular Caſe merits to be <hi>very well obſerv'd</hi>; and there is more Weight in it than perhaps appears at firſt View.<list>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1213100900:21"/>
                  <item>1. I ſay if the Buyer cannot be truſted, he cannot buy, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not buy at that time; he will make ſhift for a while, will wear his old Clothes longer, go without ſuch or ſuch <hi>fine things</hi> for himſelf, or Wife, or Children, and abate in his Expence, becauſe he has not Money to buy, and the Shop-keeper will not truſt him.
<p>Even the <hi>Drunkard</hi> will abate his Liquor, if the <hi>Alehouſe</hi> or <hi>Tavern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper</hi> will not admit him to ſcore; abundance of <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Gaiety,</hi> as well in <hi>Food</hi> as <hi>fine things,</hi> muſt abate for want of ready Money; whereas Men will venture to buy if they have Credit with the Tradeſman.</p>
                     <p>To ſay, let Luxury and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance <hi>abate,</hi> it will perhaps reform the Town, is to ſay nothing; for the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> does not lye that way: It is not whether the Luxury will abate, but will our <hi>Trade</hi> abate or not; if the <hi>Trade abates,</hi> as it certainly will, my Argument is good.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1213100900:22"/>2. On the other hand, if the <hi>Buyer</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>buy,</hi> the <hi>Seller</hi> cannot <hi>ſell</hi>; then his Stock lyes dead on his Hands, the Money for it, and for which perhaps he has been truſted himſelf, grows due, and he cannot pay; he had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſell, and give ſome <hi>Credit</hi>; but he is afraid to do that, becauſe if his Debtor refuſes to pay, he cannot force him to it. In ſhort, he muſt <hi>truſt,</hi> or <hi>ſhut</hi> up Shop, and <hi>break</hi>; and thus if a LAW ſhould be made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>arreſting</hi> the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Debtor,</hi> you at once deſtroy <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Credit</hi> and <hi>ruin</hi> the Tradeſmen.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I remember an Attempt ignorantly made, (as it appear'd afterwards) even by the <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> themſelves, to deſtroy this <hi>Petty Credit:</hi> The Shop-keepers mightily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to write over their Shop-Doors, No TRUST BY RETAIL. But the Conſequence ſoon appear'd, to the opening their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; for <hi>Thouſands</hi> of Buyers, who laid out their Money freely, and who, tho' they might not always pay down upon the <hi>Spot,</hi> yet paid tolerably well, went from their Shops, and bought where they knew they could be <hi>truſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1213100900:23"/>In a Word, any LAW which abates <hi>Petty Credit,</hi> or Truſt by Retail, will be fatal to TRADE, and would give ſuch a <hi>Blow</hi> to our Commerce in general, as it would be impoſſible for all our Heads put together to retrieve.</p>
            <p>Therefore if we will ſupport <hi>Trade,</hi> we muſt encourage <hi>Petty Credit</hi>; and if you will ſupport <hi>Petty Credit,</hi> you muſt not take away the <hi>Security</hi> to the <hi>Creditor</hi>; the Security of the Tradeſman's truſting his Neighbour is the Power he has by Law to <hi>enforce</hi> his Payment, and of arreſting and impriſoning the Debtor if he fails or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: The Law is the Tradeſman's <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and if you take away the <hi>Law,</hi> which is his <hi>Security,</hi> you take away his Trade.</p>
            <p>What is the Reaſon why in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in other Countries, they have ſo <hi>little</hi> Trade? 'tis becauſe you cannot <hi>enforce</hi> your Demand of Debt, you can't ſend the Debtor to Priſon; and therefore no Man <hi>buys</hi> till he has <hi>Money</hi> to pay; if you will impriſon the Debtor, you muſt allow him a Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, or he will come out before your Face.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1213100900:24"/>It may be true, that there is ſome <hi>Humanity</hi> in ſuch a Law, but I cannot ſay there is any <hi>Policy</hi> in it; for it overthrows <hi>perſonal</hi> Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and that in effect ſinks Trade, leſſens the <hi>Conſumption</hi> of Goods, and <hi>ruins</hi> the Tradeſmen themſelves: I cannot but think it were much better to have an <hi>Act of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> every Year, to releaſe poor Inſolvents upon reaſonable Conditions, than not have it in the Tradeſman's Power to <hi>impriſon</hi> them when they do not pay; for this <hi>Mercy</hi> will not be ſo prejudicial to the <hi>particular</hi> Creditors, as the other would be to the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Credit.</p>
            <p>It is our Buſineſs to <hi>increaſe</hi> our Trade to the utmoſt by all lawful Methods; nay, wiſe Men in Commerce tell us, ſome Errors, even in Morality, had better be wink'd at, than the Trade be ruin'd, or than any <hi>general</hi> Head of Trade be impair'd; the Meaning is, that, in ſome Caſes, even our Luxury or High-living, <hi>I do not mean our Drunkenneſs and Vice,</hi> is ſo eſſential to our Trade, that it were better <hi>continued,</hi> than be entirely <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,</hi> the Trade would ſuffer ſo much.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, a Set of <hi>Sumptuary</hi> Laws, as they are called, to reform our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies in Equipages and Dreſs, Houſe-Furniture
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1213100900:25"/>
and Diet, would effectually <hi>ruin</hi> our Commerce, ſtarve and leave unemploy'd our <hi>Poor,</hi> and reduce the whole Nation to a moſt deplorable Condition of Miſery and Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It would be the like,</hi> in Caſe of a Stop to <hi>Credit,</hi> for it would be an Abatement of the Conſumption in all Sorts of Goods, as well our Manufactures and Home Product, as our importation from abroad; for as the laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumer is the Life of all, if Credit abates, he abates his Expence, and buys leſs; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Trade declines, and leſs is conſumed. By Credit here, <hi>that I may explain Things as I go,</hi> I muſt be underſtood to mean not <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Credit, I have nothing to do with that Part here; but <hi>perſonal</hi> Credit, the <hi>ordinary</hi> Credit given by one Tradeſman to another, as well in <hi>wholeſale</hi> Dealing and Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, as in Retailing from the Shopkeeper to his Neighbours and Cuſtomers, and indeed chiefly the <hi>laſt</hi>; for on that does the Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale Part depend.</p>
            <p>Upon this Foundation I build the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which I inſiſt upon, as above; this <hi>Truſt by Retail,</hi> this <hi>petty</hi> Credit entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Right which every Citizen, thus ſelling his Goods to his Neighbour <hi>upon</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1213100900:26"/>
               <hi>his Word,</hi> that is, upon his <hi>perſonal</hi> Credit, has by <hi>Law to ſue, arreſt, impriſon,</hi> and <hi>keep in Priſon his Debtor,</hi> if he delays or refuſes to pay the Money when it is due.</p>
            <p>If you take away this <hi>Right,</hi> you take away the <hi>Credit</hi>; for no Man will ſell his Goods upon a <hi>Faith</hi> which the Debtor is not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>keep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a great Miſtake to ſay, <hi>perſonal</hi> Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is given upon the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> of the Debtor; the caſe is quite otherwiſe, the <hi>Credit</hi> is given to the <hi>Law</hi>; 'tis my being able to proſecute the Debtor in a Courſe of Law, and <hi>(as we call it)</hi> make him pay me, that encourages me to truſt him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis the ordinary Enquiry of a Tradeſman, when he would <hi>inform</hi> himſelf about a Man he deals with, not whether he be <hi>honeſt,</hi> but whether he is <hi>able</hi>; if you tell him he is a <hi>Knave,</hi> and won't pay any body if he can help it, <hi>O,</hi> ſays the <hi>Tradeſman, I don't value that; I am willing to get off the Goods, and if he is</hi> able, <hi>I'll venture; for I know how to make him willing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor does any Part of this Diſcourſe, to repeat it again, tend in the leaſt to prevent our <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> to any of theſe <hi>Debtors</hi> who

are thus <hi>impriſon'd,</hi> if by Diſaſters, Loſſes, Misfortunes, or any viſible Accident they are render'd really poor and unable, but that ſuch ſhould always be reliev'd; and if the Creditor be <hi>cruel</hi> and inexorable, as ſome perhaps will always be, the Parliament will, on all juſt Occaſions, <hi>of which alſo they are the proper Judges,</hi> deliver ſuch Inſolvents by <hi>Acts of Clemency and Grace,</hi> as they do <hi>now,</hi> and no Chriſtian Tradeſman can, I think, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at their commiſerating and relieving <hi>unfortunate,</hi> tho' otherwiſe <hi>honeſt Inſolvents.</hi>
