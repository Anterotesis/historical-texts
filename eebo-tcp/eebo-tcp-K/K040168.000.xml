         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<hi>Diſſenting Intereſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU will probably be ſurpriz'd at this
Addreſs on occaſion of your Enquiry,
ſo many months after the publication
of it. But my diſtance from the town,
and engagement in buſineſs, hinder'd
me from an early ſight of it; and many accidents,
which 'tis of no importance to mention, oblig'd
me to delay finiſhing theſe papers, ſo ſoon as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
when I began to write them. On the
whole, as I am not attempting to criticiſe on your
performance, but only to offer ſome remarks,
which I hope may be of common uſe, if what I
ſay be juſt and important, it cannot be quite too
late; and if it be either falſe or trifling, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
after all too ſoon.</p>
            <p>As I am perſuaded that the Diſſenting Cauſe is
founded on reaſon and truth, and that the honour
of God, and the publick good is nearly concern'd
in its ſupport, you have my hearty thanks for that
generous zeal with which you have appear'd for
the defence of it. On this account, I ſhould think
myſelf highly oblig'd to treat you with decency
and reſpect, how much ſoever my ſentiments might
differ from yours, as to the particular cauſes of
its decay. And indeed, Sir, you have taken the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0417901000:4"/>
moſt effectual method in the world to prevent any
thing of a rude attack, by treating all whom you
mention, even the meaneſt and the weakeſt, with
remarkable candour and humanity.</p>
            <p>But I have the happineſs of agreeing with you
in far the greater part of what you advance. I
will not now debate, whether the principles of our
Diſſent are leſs known than they formerly were;
and conſequently whether that be, properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a cauſe of the late decay of our intereſt: but
I will readily grant, Sir, that it is highly neceſſary
they ſhould be known; and I think you have done
us a great deal of ſervice by ſetting them in ſo
eaſy, and yet in ſo ſtrong a light. I hope it may
be a means of informing and eſtabliſhing ſome,
who are too buſy or too indolent to give themſelves
the trouble of peruſing what Dr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peirce,</hi>
and ſome others have written ſo copiouſly and ſo
judiciouſly upon the ſubject.</p>
            <p>I farther apprehend, Sir, that nothing can be
ſaid upon the caſe before us of more certain truth
or more ſolid importance, than what you have
frequently obſerv'd; <hi>viz.</hi> that our intereſt has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
great damage from our acting in a manner
directly oppoſite to our principles, by unſcriptural
impoſitions, and uncharitable contentions with each
other. I hope many of us have ſeen our miſtakes
here, and ſhall be careful for the future, to avoid
what has been attended with ſo many unhappy
conſequences.</p>
            <p>After having thus declar'd my agreement with
you, in the greater part of your diſcourſe, I hope,
Sir, you will pardon me, if I add, that I cannot
think that you have exhauſted your ſubject. To
ſpeak freely, I think you have omitted ſome cauſes
of the decay of our intereſt, which are at leaſt
as important as thoſe you have handled. It
is the deſign of my preſent undertaking, to point
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0417901000:5"/>
out ſome of the moſt conſiderable of them, which
have occur'd to my thoughts: And I perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
Sir, you will be no more offended with me, for
offering this ſupplement to your Enquiry, than I
imagine I ſhould myſelf be with any third perſon,
who ſhould fix upon others which may have eſcaped
us both.</p>
            <p>You will the more readily excuſe the freedom
which I take, as I imagine that the Scenes of our
Lives have been widely different<note n="†" place="bottom">As the Author to whom I write is not certainly known, I take it for granted he is what he ſeems by his manner of writing, a Gentleman of the Laity: And tho' I have been told ſince I drew up this letter, he is ſuppos'd by many to be a young miniſter in town, I have no evidence of it which is convincing to me: And as I apprehend, it would be ill manners to appear to know him under ſuch a diſguiſe, I thought it not proper to alter what I had writ with regard to the late report.</note>, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I may have had an opportunity of making ſome
uſeful obſervations which have not fallen in your
way: Tho' I queſtion not but if you, Sir, had been
in my circumſtances, you would ſoon have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd
them; and perhaps have communicated
them to the publick with much greater advantage.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add nothing more by way of introduction,
but that I chuſe the title I have prefix'd to theſe
papers, rather than that of <hi>a farther Enquiry into
the cauſes of the decay of the Diſſenting Intereſt</hi>; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Sir, as it ſeem'd moſt reſpectful to you, but
principally that I may not appear to advance any
direct charge againſt any of my brethren in the
proceſs of this diſcourſe. I am ſenſible that would
be highly indecent on many accounts, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
as it is from the example of ſeveral amongſt
them whom I have moſt intimately known, that I
have learnt many of thoſe particulars of conduct,
which I am now going to offer to your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the happieſt expedients for the revival of
our common cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0417901000:6"/>
But before I proceed to particulars, I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
(what we immediately allow, but too quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forget) that we are to be concern'd for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
not merely as the cauſe of a diſtinct party,
but of truth, honour, and liberty; and I will add,
in a great meaſure, the cauſe of ſerious piety too.
I would be far from confining all true religion to
the members of our own congregations. I am very
well aware that there are a multitude of excellent
perſons in the eſtabliſhment, both amongſt the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and the laity, who are (in their different ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
burning and ſhining lights; ſuch as reflect a
glory on the Human Nature, and the Chriſtian
Profeſſion. Yet I apprehend ſome of theſe are the
perſons who will moſt readily allow, that, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the numbers, there is generally more
practical religion to be found in our aſſemblies,
than in theirs. This was ſurely the original, and
this, if I miſtake not, muſt be the ſupport of our
cauſe. It was not merely a generous ſenſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
(which may warm the breaſt of a deiſt or
an atheiſt) but a religious reverence for the divine
authority, which animated our pious forefathers,
to ſo reſolute and ſo expenſive an oppoſition to the
attempts which were made in their day, to invade
the rights of conſcience, and the throne of God
its only ſovereign. And if the cauſe be not ſtill
maintain'd on the ſame principles, I think it will
hardly be worth our while to be much concern'd
about maintaining it at all. It muſt argue a great
defect, or partiality of thought, for any with the
<hi>Jews</hi> of old to boaſt of their being free from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
impoſitions, when they are <hi>the ſervants of ſin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John viii. 33, 34.</note>.
And all the world will evidently perceive, that it
is the temper of a Phariſee, rather than of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
to contend about <hi>mint, aniſe</hi> and <hi>cummin,</hi>
(on one ſide of the queſtion or the other) while
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0417901000:7"/>
there is an apparent indifference about <hi>the weightier
matters of the law</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxiii. 23.</note>. We that are miniſters may
entertain ourſelves and our hearers with fine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues
in defence of liberty; but I apprehend
that in the near views of death and eternity, we
ſhall have little ſatisfaction in reflecting on the
converts we have made to that, unleſs at the ſame
time we have ſome reaſon to hope that they are
perſons of true ſubſtantial piety; ſuch as will be
our crown in the day of the Lord, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
in the glories of the heavenly world. I
cannot ſay how trifling and contemptible our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
appear to me, when conſider'd in any other
view. And therefore, Sir, it will be my concern
throughout this whole diſcourſe, to point out thoſe
methods for the ſupport of the Diſſenting Intereſt,
which I imagine will be moſt ſubſervient to the
cauſe of practical religion, and vital holineſs in all
its branches.</p>
            <p>It was the obſervation of Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years ago, in his incomparable diſcourſe on the
Paſtoral Care<note n="*" place="bottom">Cap. viii. p. 204.</note>, "That the Diſſenters had then in
a great meaſure loſt that good character for
ſtrictneſs in religion, which had gain'd them
their credit, and made ſuch numbers fall off to
them." Whether that good character has ſince
been recover'd, or has not been more and more
declining, ſome others are more capable of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but I think it calls for our ſerious reflection.
And if we find upon enquiry, that this our glory
is departing, it ſurely deſerves to be mention'd, as
one cauſe, at leaſt, of the decay of our intereſt:
And that all who ſincerely wiſh well to it, ſhould
expreſs their affection, by exerting themſelves with
the utmoſt zeal, for the revival of practical religion
amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0417901000:8"/>
This muſt be our common care, according to
the various ſtations in which Providence has placed
us: And as for miniſters, nothing can be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
than that they, by virtue of their office, are
under peculiar obligations to it. And in order to
purſue it with the greater advantage, I cannot but
think that it ſhould be their concern, TO STUDY
THE CHARACTER AND TEMPER OF THEIR PEOPLE;
that, ſo far as they can do it with conſcience and
honour, they may render themſelves agreeable to
them, both in their publick miniſtrations, and their
private converſe.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, is ſo obvious a thought, that one would
imagine it could not be overlook'd or diſputed;
yet it is certain our intereſt has receiv'd conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
damage for want of a becoming regard to it,
eſpecially in thoſe who have been ſetting out in the
miniſtry amongſt us. It was therefore, Sir, with
great ſurprize, that I found you had intirely omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it in your late Enquiry, and had dropt ſome
hints, which (tho' to be ſure you did not intend it)
may very probably lead young preachers into a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
and contrary way of thinking, than which
hardly any thing can be more prejudicial, either
to them, or to the cauſe in which they are imbark'd.</p>
            <p>The paſſage of yours, to which I principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
is in the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> pages of your <hi>Enquiry</hi>:
where, amongſt other things, you obſerve, that "a
great many of thoſe things that pleaſe the people,
have often a very bad tendency in general." And
you add, "the being pleas'd, which they ſo
much inſiſt upon, ſeldom ariſes from any thing
but ſome oddneſs that hits their peculiar hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and is not from any view to edification at
all, and therefore too mean to be worthy any
one's ſtudy. The people do not uſually know
wherein oratory, ſtrength of ſpeech, the art of
perſuaſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſiſt; and therefore it is vanity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0417901000:9"/>
ſhip; <note n="t" place="bottom">Iſa. l. 11.</note>
               <hi>they only compaſs themſelves about with ſparks of
their own kindling, and ſhall at laſt lie down in ſorrow.</hi>
And if we be ſincere Chriſtians, ſuperficial ſervices
will rob us of that noble pleaſure which would attend
a more lively diſcharge of our duty, and give us a
great deal of perplexity and uneaſineſs in the review;
ſo that if we are concerned either for our own ſafety,
or comfort, it ſhould be our care, that the vigour of
religion be kept up in our hearts.</p>
            <p>I would further recommend this, as what is of the
utmoſt importance to our publick uſefulneſs. It is
probable that our people will imbibe the temper and
ſpirit which appears in us. This is ſo obvious a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that it is become a proverb; <note n="v" place="bottom">Hoſ. iv. 9.</note>
               <hi>like people, like

the energy of our addreſſes, and at once be the cauſe
and the excuſe, of the like languor and inſenſibility
in them. But if our heart be filled with vital reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
it will have a happy influence on all our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.

            <p>There is ſomething in the performances of ſome
miniſters, which ſtrangely impreſſes their pious hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Though their diſcourſes be deſtitute of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of language, yet they <note n="g" place="bottom">John i. 13.</note>
               <hi>who are born of God</hi>
find a ſweetneſs in them, which is incomparably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that which ariſeth from elegant phraſes, and
harmonious periods. That which appears low and
flat to the taſte of many, affords the experienced
Chriſtian ſuch an inward and ſublime pleaſure, as is
not to be found in the higheſt ſtrains of the moſt pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
eloquence. Happy <note n="h" place="bottom">2 Tim. iii. 17.</note>
               <hi>the men of God,</hi> who have
this divine unction which ſo powerfully attracts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
ſouls, whoſe reliſh is formed by converſing with
heaven. They are like <hi>Aaron</hi> the high-prieſt, when
he was conſecrated to his office; the holy oil which
was <note n="i" place="bottom">Pſ. cxxxiii. 2.</note>
               <hi>poured on his head,</hi> in ſo abundant a quantity, <hi>that
it flowed down to the ſkirts of his garments,</hi> was grateful
to all who were about him: So when theſe anointed
ones come forth to miniſter, a ſweet perfume, and a
divine fragrancy diffuſeth itſelf through the whole aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
and is delightfully perceived, by all thoſe who
<note n="k" place="bottom">Heb. v. 14.</note>
               <hi>have their ſenſes ſpiritually exerciſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The advanced piety of our fathers in the miniſtry,
did eminently conduce to their remarkable ſucceſs.
The <hi>Memoirs</hi> which we have of the lives of ſeveral
of them, manifeſt their great attainments in vital and
inward religion; and I fear we ſhall never recover the
dying intereſts of Chriſtianity, 'till that be found in
us, which render'd them ſo ſignally uſeful in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0417901000:11"/>
I have heard it obſerved by ſome, who are in a way
of thinking different from us, that our publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations
are managed with greater propriety and
exactneſs, than they were in the days of our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.
And without ſuſpicion of flattery, I can
congratulate the riſing generation of miniſters among
us, with the great improvements they have made, in
the method and ſtyle of their performances. But if
the form and order of them is better, I am afraid
the temper of our minds is worſe; and ſince the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the laſt age did ſo much good with their
unpoliſhed addreſſes, and we ſo little with our neater
compoſures, one would think this might fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us, that <note n="l" place="bottom">Mat xvi. 23.</note>
               <hi>a ſavour of the things that be of God</hi>
is of much greater importance to a miniſter of the
Goſpel, than that politeneſs which is now ſo much
admired and affected. It is happy, indeed, when both
theſe meet in the ſame perſon, but inſtances of this
are very rare. Every pious preacher cannot deliver
himſelf with elegance and exactneſs; and accurate
method and beautiful language, are not always ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
and ſupported by real devotion. We ſhould
therefore divide our work, and prepare our hearts as
well as lips for the ſervices of the ſanctuary, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
after ſeriouſneſs of ſpirit, which will more
effectually recommend our labours to enlighten'd
minds, than <note n="m" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 4.</note>
               <hi>excellency of ſpeech, or the enticing words
of man's wiſdom.</hi>

            <p>II. We ſhould not only <note n="n" place="bottom">1 Tim. iv. 16.</note>
               <hi>take heed unto ourſelves,</hi> but
alſo <hi>to our doctrine,</hi> that our preaching may have the
moſt direct tendency to do good.</p>
            <p>Upon this head I cannot but adviſe, that ſublime
ſpeculations and abſtruſe controverſies, ſhould not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
be introduced into our ſermons. Theſe <note n="o" place="bottom">Ib. i. 4.</note>
               <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
queſtions rather than godly edifying.</hi> Chriſtianity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0417901000:12"/>
is a <hi>doctrine according to godlineſs, and not a ſtrife about
words.</hi> It is an eaſy matter to engage our warmer
hearers in diſputes on ſubjects, which neither they, nor
we can fully underſtand; and the moſt unfit for ſuch
work, are generally the moſt forward to enter into it.
I allow, it is the ready way to procure the regards of
thoſe, who lay a mighty ſtreſs upon their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but their eſteem will be purchaſed at too dear a
rate, ſince inſtead of promoting true religion, it will
moſt certainly deſtroy it. <note n="p" place="bottom">

               <hi>Where this zeal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

may poſſibly admire it for its ſhining luſtre, but too
fatal experience proves it to be a raging flame and a
devouring fire, and wherever it breaks out, there is
reaſon to fear, that practical godlineſs will ſoon be
conſumed. The thoughts and the diſcourſes of
Chriſtians, will be ſo entirely ſwallowed up by the
matters in debate, that things of the greateſt moment
will be diſregarded by them; and their tempers will
be ſo embitter'd againſt each other, that charity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the <note n="q" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiii. 13.</note>
               <hi>greateſt</hi> of all graces, will perhaps be counted
a crime.</p>
            <p>We live in an age, in which all advantages will be
taken againſt Chriſtianity: And our pulpit ſkirmiſhes
have made ſport for unbelievers, and furniſhed them
with matter for banter and ridicule. By theſe we have
given them occaſion to ſay, <note n="r" place="bottom">Hoſ. ix. 7.</note>

if thoſe inſtances of our weakneſs and folly were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in everlaſting oblivion, that they might no more
be mentioned to our diſgrace, nor improved to the
prejudice of that excellent religion which we profeſs.
Let us walk in <note n="t" place="bottom">Pſ. xxvii. 11.</note>
               <hi>a plain path becauſe of our enemies,</hi> and

our ſacred hours, in conſidering thoſe important ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which cannot be omitted, without the greateſt
injury to the ſouls of our people.</p>
            <p>Our firſt attempts ſhould be to impreſs their minds,
with a deep and an abiding ſenſe of the pollution
and miſery of that eſtate into which they are fallen
by ſin. Here true converſion begins; <note n="u" place="bottom">Mat. ix. 12, 13.</note>
               <hi>the whole
need not the phyſician, but thoſe who are ſick,</hi> and Chriſt
<hi>did not come to call the righteous, but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
Men will never be concerned about the reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their natures, 'till they ſee the depravity of
them; neither will they <note n="a" place="bottom">iii. 7.</note>
               <hi>flee from the wrath which is

               <hi>become guilty
before God,</hi> and ſo expoſed to it.</p>
            <p>This, by the bleſſing of GOD, will engage them to
<note n="c" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 30.</note>
               <hi>cry out, What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> and diſpoſe
them to receive the <note n="d" place="bottom">Luke ii. 10.</note>
               <hi>good tidings of great joy,</hi> which
the Goſpel <hi>brings.</hi> Convinced ſinners will rejoice to
hear of a Saviour, and therefore we ſhould <note n="e" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 18.</note>
               <hi>preach
to them Jeſus,</hi> and make <note n="f" place="bottom">2 Cor. ii. 14.</note>

               <hi>whom to know is life eternal.</hi> This
will lead us to conſider the dignity of his perſon as
the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and thoſe ſeveral offices which he
ſuſtains, as the prophet, the prieſt, and the king of
his church. Here we ſhall have occaſion to treat of
his myſterious incarnation, his holy life, his divine
doctrine, his wonderful miracles, his painful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
death, his reſurrection and aſcenſion into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
his exaltation to the right-hand of GOD, and
his glorious appearance to the univerſal judgment.
Theſe arguments ſhould be frequently and largely
inſiſted upon, becauſe they are the diſtinguiſhing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Chriſtian revelation, and if they are not
of high importance, that revelation was given us in
vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0417901000:14"/>
Having propoſed to loſt ſinners that <note n="h" place="bottom">Heb. ix. 12.</note>
               <hi>redemption
which the bleſſed Jeſus hath obtained,</hi> we ſhould then
acquaint them with the method in which it is applied
by the Holy Ghoſt. This will bring us to open the
nature of faith, repentance, and effectual calling,
and to ſhew in what manner they are wrought. An
account of theſe may be uſeful to all ſorts of hearers,
the unregenerate ſinner may thereby be convinced
that he is deſtitute of them, and this may put him
upon fervent prayer, and conſtant endeavours after
an acquaintance with them: And ſincere Chriſtians
will be wonderfully confirmed and comforted, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
on theſe myſteries of the <note n="i" place="bottom">Luke xvii. 21.</note>
               <hi>kingdom of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us,</hi> becauſe they will be only a tranſcript of that
original draught of them, which is more fairly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
upon their hearts, by the ſacred Spirit himſelf.
It is an excellent attainment in a miniſter, to be able
to handle theſe ſubjects clearly and diſtinctly; and
nothing will conduce more to this, than a ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the various turns and movements of the
ſoul, and an experience of them in ourſelves; for as
<note n="k" place="bottom">Prov. xxvii. 19.</note>
               <hi>in water face anſwereth to face, ſo the heart of man
to man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The privileges of true believers do likewiſe deſerve
our very attentive regards. Theſe are many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
too; they are <note n="l" place="bottom">Eph. i. 3.</note>
               <hi>bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings
in Chriſt,</hi> and it is fit they ſhould know what they
are, that they may rejoice in them. The apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> hath left us ſeveral excellent diſcourſes on theſe
heads, which ſhould greatly recommend them to all
Chriſtian miniſters, who deſire to form themſelves on
ſo compleat a model.</p>
            <p>Neither ſhould we neglect the various exerciſes and
trials, which the ſervants of GOD are expoſed to in
this life. Theſe proceed from different cauſes, and
will require a diſtinct and particular conſideration, if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0417901000:15"/>
we would aſſiſt them in their way to heaven. It is a
neceſſary and uſeful part of our work, <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Cor. i. 4.</note>
               <hi>to comfort
them who are in trouble,</hi> and to ſay <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſ. xxxv. 4.</note>
               <hi>unto them who

be ready, <note n="c" place="bottom">l. 4.</note>
               <hi>to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is

and we ſhall be very defective in our duty, if we
do not give it them, in the moſt kind and tender
manner.</p>
            <p>I add, that we muſt <hi>conſtantly</hi> and earneſtly <note n="d" place="bottom">Tit. iii. 8.</note>
               <hi>affirm,</hi>
               <hi>that they which have believed in God, might be careful
to maintain good works.</hi> The great duties of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

that <note n="e" place="bottom">ii. 10.</note>
               <hi>the doctrine of God our Saviour may in all things

               <hi>miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and manage our practical diſcourſes in a way
ſuitable to the Goſpel diſpenſation, we muſt direct
men to thoſe aſſiſtances which are promiſed, and to
thoſe animating motives which are propoſed there, to
enable and incline them, to purify themſelves from
the pollutions <note n="g" place="bottom">vii. 1.</note>
               <hi>of the fleſh and of the ſpirit, and to
perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> Nothing will be
done without divine influences, and there are no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
ſo forcible as thoſe which are taken from
evangelical conſiderations; and if theſe are omitted,
we ſhall treat on moral ſubjects with leſs propriety and
ſpirit, than many heathens have done.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe weighty ſubjects, which
we ſhould handle at large in the courſe of our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And in the management of them, we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in the firſt place to conſult <note n="h" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 2.</note>
               <hi>the oracles of God.</hi>
There is an admirable fulneſs and ſufficiency in the

               <hi>for doctrine, for reproof, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and for inſtruction in righteouſneſs</hi>; they will
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0417901000:16"/>
furniſh us with the moſt ſolid and popular thoughts,
to illuſtrate, confirm, and enforce the arguments we
are upon. If we will be at the pains to collect out
of the inſpired Volume, the hints which are given on
any topic, we ſhall be ſurpriſed to find, how well
they are adapted, to render the <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Tim. iii. 17.</note>
               <hi>man of God perfect,
throughly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi> In the forming
of our diſcourſes, we ſhould attend more to <note n="b" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 13.</note>
               <hi>that
which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual things
with ſpiritual,</hi> and then our ſermons would be more
compleat, and much more edifying than they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
are.</p>
            <p>It is certainly of great importance, that we ſhould
be well acquainted with the contents, and with the
ſenſe of the ſacred writings. We ſhould frequently
read them, diligently ſtudy them, and as we have
opportunity, we ſhould expound them in our families,
and in our congregations: If this be our conſtant
practice, we may then hope, that we ſhall be <note n="c" place="bottom">Mat. xiii. 52.</note>
               <hi>as
ſcribes inſtructed unto the kingdom of heaven, bringing
forth out of our treaſures things new and old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor would I have the writings of other wiſe and
good men entirely laid aſide; I could rather wiſh,
that the uſe of ſome of them, which are much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
might be revived. I particularly refer to the
works of ſome of the <hi>old Puritans,</hi> and of the Divines
of the laſt age. I own myſelf an admirer of them,
and have often thought it a great mercy, that there
are ſo many of them in the hands of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to ſupply what is deficient in our more faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inſtructions. I allow that the ſtyle of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
men is ſometimes heavy, their diction low,
and their method not the moſt eaſy or juſt; but their
thoughts are weighty, their matter ſubſtantial, and
their diſcourſes ſpiritual and affecting. I once aſked
a very <hi>popular preacher,</hi> (who filled a conſiderable
poſt amongſt us, with great reputation and uſefulneſs)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0417901000:17"/>
a thouſand arguments concurring to inſpire us
with a ſort of paternal tenderneſs for the ſouls of
the meaneſt of our people. This will teach us
to bear with their prejudices, to accommodate
ourſelves to their weakneſs; and to conſider it as
a mixture of impiety and cruelty, to neglect num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of them, out of complaiſance to the taſte of
a few, who are perhaps ſome of them but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional
viſitants, and whom we judge by their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
rather than by any perſonal acquaintance, to
be a part of the polite world.</p>
            <p>Did I affect to throw together all that might be
ſaid on this ſubject, I might both illuſtrate and
confirm what I have already written, by ſhewing
at large, that Chriſtianity is a religion originally
calculated for the plainer part of mankind, by that
God who <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. i. 27.</note>
               <hi>has choſen the fooliſh things of the world
to confound the wiſe, and the weak things of the world
to confound the things which are mighty</hi>; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that a neglect and contempt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, is far from being the ſpirit of the
goſpel. I might add many remarks to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
on the preaching and conduct of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
and fill whole pages with quotations from him and
the reſt of the Apoſtles, and many more from
ſome of the moſt ancient and celebrated Fathers
of the Church. But I do not think it neceſſary
for the ſupport of my argument, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
that you, Sir, in particular, have no need
of being taught theſe things from me.</p>
            <p>Permit me only to add, (what you muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
have obſerv'd) that our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
is a moſt amiable and wonderful example of a
plain, familiar, and popular preacher. When we
come to peruſe thoſe divine diſcourſes, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
a confeſſion from his very enemies that he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0417901000:18"/>
ſpake as never man ſpake, we find neither a long
train of abſtract reaſonings, nor a ſucceſſion of
labour'd periods, adorn'd with an artificial exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but the moſt ſolid and important ſenſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
in an eaſy and natural way, illuſtrated
by ſimilies taken from the moſt common objects
in life, and enforced with lively figures, and the
ſtrongeſt energy of expreſſion; which is well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with all the former. So that upon the
whole it was moſt happily calculated, at once to
inſtruct the moſt ignorant, and to awaken the
moſt negligent hearer. I cannot but wiſh that
ſome judicious writer would attempt to ſet this
part of our Lord's character in a clearer and a
more particular light; and would ſhew us how
the whole of his conduct, as well as the manner
of his addreſs, was calculated to promote his uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
under the character of a preacher of
righteouſneſs. I hope ſuch an eſſay might be very
ſerviceable to thoſe of us, who have the honour
to ſucceed him in that part of his work; and I
perſuade myſelf that it would furniſh us with a
variety of beautiful remarks on many paſſages in
the evangelical hiſtorians, which are not to be
found in the moſt celebrated commentators.</p>
            <p>You will excuſe me, Sir, for having inſiſted ſo
largely on the neceſſity of endeavouring to render
ourſelves agreeable to our people; becauſe I am
fully perſuaded, that it is of great importance to
the ſupport and revival of the Diſſenting Intereſt.
I hope you already apprehend that I intend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this advice, which is below the purſuit of
the moſt elevated genius, or the moſt generous
temper; nothing inconſiſtent with the politeneſs
of the gentleman and the ſcholar, or the dignity
of the chriſtian and the miniſter. You cannot
imagine that I would recommend a popularity
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0417901000:19"/>
rais'd by quirks and jingles, or ſounded on af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
tones, or ridiculous grimaces; and much leſs
on an attempt to inflame the paſſions of mankind
about trifling controverſies, and the peculiar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural
phraſes of a party. Such a popularity
as this, is almoſt the only thing that is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable,
than the inſolent pride of deſpiſing the
people.</p>
            <p>If any of my younger brethren were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how another popularity, of a far more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
kind, is to be purſued and ſecured, I
anſwer, that their own converſe and obſervation
on the world, muſt furniſh them with the moſt
valuable inſtructions on this head. And tho' ſome
of their particular remarks may differ, according
to the various places and circumſtances in which
they are made; yet I apprehend there are many
things of conſiderable importance, in which they
will all agree. As for inſtance:</p>
            <p>They will quickly ſee that the generality of
the Diſſenters, who appear to be perſons of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
piety, have been deeply impreſs'd with the
peculiarities of the goſpel-ſcheme. They have
felt the divine energy of thoſe important doctrines,
to awaken, and revive, and enlarge the ſoul; and
therefore they will have a peculiar reliſh for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
upon them. So that if a man ſhould ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
confine himſelf to ſubjects of natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and moral virtue, and ſeldom fix on the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of Chriſt, and the ſpirit, and then perhaps
treat them with ſuch caution, that he might ſeem
rather to be making conceſſions to an adverſary,
than giving vent to the fulneſs of his heart on its
darling ſubject, he would ſoon find, that all the
penetration and eloquence of an angel, could not
make him univerſally agreeable to our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0417901000:20"/>
Many of our people have paſs'd thro' a variety
of exerciſes in their minds, relating to the great
concern of eternal ſalvation. And they apprehend
that the ſcripture teaches us to aſcribe this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
to the agency of ſatan, and the corruptions of
our own heart on the one hand, and the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the holy ſpirit of God on the other. It
is therefore very agreeable to them, to hear theſe
experimental ſubjects handled with ſeriouſneſs
and tenderneſs. It raiſes their veneration for
ſuch a miniſter, as for one who has himſelf taſted
of the grace of God, and encourages their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in him, and their expectations of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by his labours. On the other hand, it
grieves them when theſe ſubjects are much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected,
and gives them the moſt formidable ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions
if one word be dropt which ſeems to pour
contempt upon them, as if they were all fancy
and enthuſiaſm; (with which, it muſt be granted,
they are ſometimes mix'd.)</p>
            <p>The greater part of moſt diſſenting congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
conſiſting (as we before obſerv'd) of plain
people, who have not enjoy'd the advantages of a
learned education, nor had leiſure for improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by after-ſtudy, it is apparently neceſſary
that a man ſhould ſpeak <hi>plainly</hi> to them, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
they ſhould underſtand and approve what he
ſays. And as for thoſe that are truly religious,
they attend on publick worſhip, not that they
may be amuſed with a form or a ſound, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
with ſome new and curious ſpeculation;
but that their hearts may be enlarged as in the
preſence of God, that they may be powerfully
affected with thoſe great things of religion, which
they already know and believe, that ſo their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
may be ſuitably influenced by them. And
to this purpoſe they deſire that their miniſters
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0417901000:21"/>
may ſpeak as if they were in earneſt, in a <hi>lively</hi>
and <hi>pathetick,</hi> as well as a clear and intelligible
manner.</p>
            <p>Such is the taſte of the generality of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters;
a taſte which I apprehend they will ſtill
retain, whatever attempts may be made to alter
it. And I muſt take the liberty to ſay, that I
conceive this turn of thought in the people to be
the great ſupport of our intereſt, and not the
little ſcruples which you hint at in the 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> page of
your Letter, nor even thoſe rational and generous
principles of liberty, which you ſo clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and ſo ſtrenuouſly aſſert. And I cannot
but believe, that if the eſtabliſhed clergy, and
the diſſenting miniſters in general, were mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to exchange their ſtrain of preaching, and their
manner of living but for one year, it would be
the ruin of our cauſe, even though there ſhould
be no alteration in the conſtitution and diſcipline
of the church of <hi>England.</hi> However you might
fare at <hi>London,</hi> or in ſome very ſingular caſes
elſewhere, I can hardly imagine that there
would be diſſenters enough left in ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
counties, to fill one of our largeſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-places.</p>
            <p>We have then advanced thus far; that he who
would be generally agreeable to diſſenters, muſt
be an evangelical, an experimental, a plain and
an affectionate preacher. Now I muſt do our
common people the juſtice to own, that when
theſe points are ſecured, they are not very
delicate in their demands, with regard to the
forms of a diſcourſe. They will not in ſuch a
caſe be very much diſguſted, though there be no
regular charm of reaſoning, no remarkable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of thought or of expreſſion, no elegance
of language, and but little decency of addreſs.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0417901000:22"/>
The want of all theſe is forgiven, to what they
apprehend of much greater importance. Yet, Sir,
I would not from hence inſer, that theſe things
are to be neglected; on the contrary, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it is abſolutely neceſſary, that they ſhould
be diligently attended to, in order to obtain that
univerſal popularity, which I think ſo deſirable
for the ſake of more extenſive uſefulneſs. A
man of a good taſte will certainly take ſome care
about them. 'Tis what he owes to himſelf, and
to the politer part of his audience, whom he
will never be willing to loſe in the crowd: And
he need not fear that a prudent regard to them,
will ſpoil his acceptance with the people. Few
of them like a diſcourſe the worſe for being
thoroughly good; and the accompliſhed orator
will find, perhaps to his ſurprize, that they will
not only know and feel the important truths of
religion, in the moſt agreeable dreſs he can give
them, but that they will even applaud the order
and regularity of his compoſures, the beauty of his
language, and the gracefulneſs of his delivery,
at the ſame time that they have the candour
not to complain of the indigeſted rovings, the
unnatural tranſports, and the awkward diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the pious well-meaning, but injudicious
preacher. For human nature is ſo formed, that
ſome manners of thinking and ſpeaking are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
agreeable and delightful. 'Tis the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of eloquence to be maſter of theſe, and
ſhould, I think, be the care of every one that
ſpeaks in publick, to purſue them as far as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
and opportunity will allow<note n="†" place="bottom">This is that regard to the <hi>SENSUS COMMUNIS,</hi> which <hi>Tully</hi> thinks ſo neceſſary.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0417901000:23"/>
The man who forms himſelf upon ſuch views
as theſe, if he be not remarkably deficient in
natural capacities, will probably be popular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the diſſenters <hi>as a Preacher</hi>: But a think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man will eaſily perceive this is not the only
character under which a miniſter is conſidered.
His people will naturally and reaſonably expect a
<hi>Conduct</hi> anſwerable to his publick diſcourſes; and
without it, he cannot be thoroughly agreeable to
them. They will take it for granted, that a
man ſo well acquainted with divine truths, and
one that ſeems to be ſo deeply affected with
them, ſhould be regular and exemplary in the
whole of his behaviour, and free from the taint
of vice, or of folly, in any remarkable degree.
They will expect that he ſhould be far from
being a ſlave to ſecular intereſt, or to the little
trifles of food, dreſs, or domeſtick accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that he ſhould avoid every thing
haughty and overbearing, or peeviſh and fretful
in his daily converſe. They will conclude, that
a deſire of doing good to ſouls, will make him
eaſy of acceſs to thoſe who apply to him for
advice, with regard to their ſpiritual concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and that it will likewiſe diſpoſe him at
proper times to viſit all the people of his charge,
the poor as well as the rich; and that not only
under the character of a friend, but of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
in a direct view to their ſpiritual edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And if a man deſire the affections of his
people, he muſt not diſappoint ſuch expectations
as theſe.</p>
            <p>The tenderneſs with which parents intereſt
themſelves in the concerns of their children, and
the earneſt deſire that all religious parents muſt
neceſſarily have, that theirs may be <hi>a ſeed to ſerve
the Lord,</hi> will engage them very kindly to accept
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0417901000:24"/>
our care, in attempting to bring them under early
impreſſions of ſerious piety. Catechiſing has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been generally found a very popular, as well as
a very uſeful practice. And here I think it is much
to be wiſh'd that our labour may extend to the
youth, as well as to little children; that in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
way they may be methodically acquainted
with the principles of natural religion, and then
with the evidences of the truth of Chriſtianity,
and with the nature of it, as it is exhibited in
the New Teſtament; both with regard to the
privileges and the duties of chriſtians. As this
might be a means of filling our churches with a
conſiderable number of rational, catholick, and
pious communicants, from whom conſiderable
uſefulneſs might in time be expected, ſo it would
greatly oblige their religious parents, and lay a
foundation for a growing friendſhip between us,
and our catechumens, in the advance of life.</p>
            <p>I once thought to have inſiſted more largely on
theſe hints, but am happily prevented by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of Mr. <hi>Some's</hi> Sermon, on the methods to
be taken by miniſters for the revival of religion.
He has fully ſpoken my ſentiments, with regard
to many of thoſe articles on which I have only
glanc'd. I perſuade my ſelf, Sir, you will read it
with a great deal of pleaſure; for (ſo far as I
can judge) this ſermon is almoſt as agreeable an
example of that preaching, as his life is of that
conduct, which he recommends. I am confident
that a man of your good ſenſe muſt neceſſarily
approve the ſcheme which I have briefly laid down,
and which is there largely conſider'd and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
Were you to chuſe a Paſtor for your
ſelf, I doubt not but you would rejoice in ſuch
a one; and you would probably have the hearty
concurrence of the weakeſt and moſt illiterate of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0417901000:25"/>
your pious neighbours. My younger brethren
(for whom alone I am now preſuming to write)
can have no reaſon to complain, that I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
them either a mean, or a ſevere task. I
heartily deſire to be their companion in all the
moſt laborious, and ſelf-denying parts of it; and
I perſuade my ſelf, that we ſhall find it, on the
whole, as delightful as honourable, and as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to our ſelves, as it will be ſerviceable to
the publick intereſt.</p>
            <p>There ſeems to be but one material objection
againſt all this; and it is an objection, in which,
I doubt not, but your own thoughts have already
prevented me. It may perhaps be pleaded, that
we have a ſort of people amongſt us, whoſe appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
and eſteem cannot be obtain'd by ſuch
honourable methods as I propos'd. For they,
whom we call the <hi>rigidly orthodox,</hi> are ſo devoted
to a peculiar ſett of human phraſes, which have
been introduc'd into the explication of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
doctrines, that they will hardly entertain
a favourable thought of any who ſcruple the uſe
of them, or who do not ſeem to value them as
highly as they, tho' they may, on all other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
be ever ſo conſiderable.</p>
            <p>You, Sir, hint at <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 44.</note> a very expeditious remedy for
uneaſineſs ariſing from this quarter; that perſons
of generous and bigotted ſentiments, ſhould meet
in different places. In <hi>London</hi> it is certainly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
and may perhaps be moſt expedient; but
to attempt any ſuch ſeparation in the country,
would be the utter ruin of many of our ſocieties,
which now make ſome conſiderable appearance.
But beſides my regard to the miniſters and ſocieties
to which they are related, I muſt confeſs, I have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0417901000:26"/>
too much tenderneſs for the perſons themſelves, to
be willing intirely to give them up. I have been
intimately acquainted with thoſe who have been
accus'd, and perhaps not unjuſtly, of this unhappy
attachment to human phraſes, and nicety in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial
points; and I muſt do many of them the
juſtice to own, that I have found very excellent
qualities mingled with this exceſs of zeal, (which
muſt methinks appear pardonable in them, when
we conſider how artificially it has been infus'd;
and how innocently they have receiv'd and retain'd
it, from a real principle of conſcience to God.)
But, indulging them in this one article, ſeveral of
them will appear to be perſons of ſo much humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and piety, of ſo much integrity and generoſity,
of ſo much activity and zeal for the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
that ſeparate from all views to private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
or reputation, one would heartily wiſh to
do all he honeſtly can, to remove thoſe prejudices,
which give them ſo much uneaſineſs, and impair
the luſtre of ſo many virtues and graces. And
if at the ſame time we can ſecure their eſteem and
friendſhip, it may have ſuch an influence, both on
our own comfort and uſefulneſs in life, that it
muſt be great ignorance or pride to deſpiſe it.</p>
            <p>You will readily grant, Sir, that the thing is in
it ſelf deſirable: The great queſtion is, how it
may be effected? And here I will venture to ſay
freely, that I apprehend bigotry of all kinds, to
be a fortreſs, which may be attack'd by ſap more
ſucceſsfully than by ſtorm. It is evident that we
have moſt of us ſomething of the humour of
children, that graſp a thing ſo much the more
eagerly, when an attempt is made to wreſt it out
of their hands by violence; and yet perhaps will
drop it themſelves in a few minutes, if you can
but divert their attention to ſomething elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0417901000:27"/>
From ſuch a view of things, I apprehend, we
are to judge of the moſt proper methods of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with thoſe, whoſe caſe is now under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
You, Sir, may tell them again, and again,
with your natural coolneſs and moderation, <note n="*" place="bottom">Enquiry, p. 34, 37.</note>
               <hi>That
it would be an inſtance of their modeſty to reſign their
pleaſures to the general notions and judgment—that
inſtead of aſſuming the characters of judges and cenſors,
they ſhould put on the humble temper of learners—
and receive the truth without being jealous of hereſy
in our younger preachers—</hi>And at the ſame time,
that you are thus giving your advice, you may
give your reaſons, as clearly and handſomely, as you
have given them for Nonconformity in this Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
yet after all, you will probably find, that the
<hi>Civium Ardor</hi> PRAVA JUBENTIUM will
out-noiſe the voice of the charmer, charming ever
ſo wiſely. And ſhould I exert my ſelf with greater
warmth and eagerneſs, ſhould I grow a bigot in
the defence of catholiciſm, and load thoſe of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſentiments with reproaches, becauſe they
have profited no better by ſo many ſolid argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
I ſhould indeed pay a very great compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to them, in ſuppoſing them capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and admitting truth, under ſo diſagreeable a
diſguiſe; but it would be at the expence of my
own character and eaſe, and I ſhould run the risk
of being ſeverely ſcorch'd by that flame, which I
pretended to extinguiſh, by pouring on oil.</p>
            <p>I cannot but think it much more adviſeable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Apoſtle's maxim of <hi>becoming all
things to all men,</hi> to ſtudy to accommodate our
ſelves in this reſpect, as well as in others, to the
infirmities of our hearers, as far as with a ſafe
conſcience we may. If we can put a tolerably
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0417901000:28"/>
good ſenſe on any of their favourite phraſes, it
would ſurely be a moſt unreaſonable ſtiffneſs and
perverſeneſs of temper, to avoid it merely becauſe
they admire it. Or if we cannot go ſo far, we
may at leaſt lay aſide any darling phraſes of our
own, which we know will be offenſive to them.
(For if the Bible be a compleat rule, <hi>our</hi> human
forms are no more neceſſary than <hi>theirs.</hi>) Chriſtians
as ſuch profeſs a reverence for the Scripture, and
many of theſe chriſtians have a diſtinguiſhing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to it, as they have felt its divine energy on
their ſouls. Now, Sir, with ſubmiſſion to the
better judgment of my brethren, I think we,
who are Miniſters, ſhould take them by the handle,
and ſhould labour to diſcover to them, more and
more, the beauty and fulneſs of the word of God,
not only with regard to this or that particular
doctrine, but to the whole ſyſtem of truth and
duty contain'd in it. 'Tis a ſubject on which we
might ſpeak, and they would hear with pleaſure;
and it would not only divert their attention, and
their zeal from other things, which might give
uneaſineſs, but would have a direct tendency to
enlarge their views, and ſweeten their tempers,
beyond all our encomiums on liberty and catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciſm,
or our ſatyrs on bigotry and impoſition.</p>
            <p>I likewiſe apprehend, that a regard to what
was ſaid under the former heads, will farther
conduce to this happy end. When theſe exact
people hear us preaching in a truly ſpiritual and
experimental ſtrain, and at the ſame time in ſuch
a rational and graceful manner, as may ſet our
diſcourſes above contempt, and make them agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the younger and politer part of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory,
as well as to others; they will quickly ſee
that it is not for their own intereſt, or that of
their children, to drive us away with a rigorous
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0417901000:29"/>
ſeverity. And therefore, inſtead of ſtudying to
find us hereticks, they will rather put the moſt
favourable ſenſe on ambiguous expreſſions, and
labour to believe us as orthodox as they can:
Or, if they ſuſpect us to be in the dark as to
ſome particulars, yet they will charitably hope,
that age and experience will perfect what is
wanting; and that <hi>God will reveal it to us</hi> in his
own time. With theſe views they will chearfully
commit themſelves to our miniſterial care, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ſeems to open a way for our ſettlement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. And when they find, that they are
handſomely treated by us, that no direct attack is
made upon their darling notions; but that the
great concerns of practical religion (as dear to
them as to any people upon earth) are plainly
and faithfully purſued by us, both in publick and
private (to the refreſhment of their own ſouls,
and to the evident advantage of many others)
they will contract a tender, growing affection for
us: And thus their bigotry will gradually wear
away, till perhaps they come at laſt joyfully to
embrace thoſe more generous notions, from which
they would at firſt have ſtarted back with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
            <p>Thus we may, after the example of our great
maſter, teach our followers, as they are able to
bear it: And by this moderation, may be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
in healing the breaches which we profeſs to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in reſcuing many an excellent ſoul from
a painful and diſhonourable bondage; and in
ſpreading a generous, candid, chriſtian ſpirit,
which will be the glory and happineſs of our
Intereſt in general, as well as of the particular
ſocieties under our care. And in the mean time
another generation will be riſing, whom we may
hope to form, in a manner agreeable to our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0417901000:30"/>
own ſentiments, who may tranſmit to remote
ages, thoſe united principles of piety and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiciſm,
which they have happily learnt from
us.</p>
            <p>I cannot but think, that ſuch rational and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proſpects may encourage us to ſubmit to ſome
reſtraints, which we ſhould not otherwiſe have
choſe. But if, after all, we inflexibly inſiſt on
"<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 37.</note>
               <hi>as unbounded a liberty of ſpeaking our ſentiments
in publick, as of forming them in private,</hi>" or in
the language of <hi>Solomon, of uttering all our mind,</hi>
I think we ſhall dearly purchaſe the pleaſure of
hearing our ſelves talk, on a ſubject on which we
can do little more, than echo back a part of what
has been ſo copiouſly and judiciouſly written, and
ſo frequently repeated by others. The wiſer part
of mankind will look upon us as forward heirs,
who ſpend our eſtate of reputation and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in life, before we come to it; and upon the
whole, we ſhall not only exceedingly injure our
ſelves in private life, which is comparatively but a
trifle, but ſhall impair our future uſefulneſs, and
even wound the darling cauſe of liberty, to which
we are ſo ready to ſacrifice all. For I ſeriouſly
declare, that if I could be ſo wicked as to form a
deſign againſt it, and ſo baſe as to proſecure it by
clandeſtine and hypocritical methods, I would only
ſet my ſelf to declaim in its favour, with impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
zeal, and unbounded fury.</p>
            <p>You have now, Sir, all that I think it proper to
ſay, at preſent, concerning the methods by which
I apprehend thoſe of us, who are imploy'd in the
miniſtry, may moſt effectually contribute to the
revival of the Diſſenting Intereſt. I can aſſure
you, they are not the reveries of my own cloſet,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0417901000:31"/>
but obſervations which I have drawn from life, as
occaſions have occur'd in converſing with a variety
of perſons, of different ſtations, reliſhes, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.
I have the better opinion of many of them,
as I know that they are thoroughly agreeable to
the ſentiments and conduct of ſome of the moſt
conſiderable perſons of all denominations amongſt
us, both in town and country; whoſe friendſhip
is the honour and pleaſure of my life. I am par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
confirm'd in this way of thinking, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the ſucceſs which ſuch meaſures have had
in the congregations of my fathers and brethren in
theſe parts. For I know, that in many of them,
the number of Diſſenters is greatly increas'd
within theſe twenty years; and the intereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
ſo to flouriſh, that I am confident ſome of
our honeſt people, who converſe only in their own
neighbourhood, will be ſurpriz'd to hear of <hi>an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the cauſes of its decay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If what I have writ appear reaſonable to you,
Sir, I cannot but wiſh that you, and other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the laity, who are heartily concern'd for
our intereſt, would endeavour to cultivate ſuch
ſentiments as theſe in the minds of young miniſters
of your acquaintance. We are naturally very
deſirous of being known to you, and ſingled out
as the object of your regard. Whereas we early
begin to look with a comparative contempt upon
the meaner ſort of people, as an ignoble Herd—
<hi>Fruges conſumere nati—</hi> Whilſt engag'd in our
preparatory ſtudies, we are indeed ſo generous,
as to give up one another to the vulgar; but we
have each of us the penetration to diſcover, that
there is ſomething uncommon in our dear ſelves,
by which nature ſeems to have intended us to be
(as we abſurdly enough expreſs it) orators for
the polite. Theſe arrogant and pernicious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0417901000:32"/>
we ſometimes carry along with us, from
the academy to the pulpit; where perhaps, we
make our firſt appearance infinitely ſolicitous
about every trifling circumſtance of a diſcourſe,
yet negligent of that which ſhould be the ſoul of
it. And if the people are not as much charm'd
with it as ourſelves, we have then an evident
demonſtration of their incorrigible ſtupidity; and
ſo reſentment concurs with pride and ambition,
to ſet us at the remoteſt diſtance from thoſe, who
ought to be the objects of our tendereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</p>
            <p>If an elder miniſter have ſo much compaſſion
and generoſity, as to deal freely with us upon
theſe heads, and give us ſuch advice as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
require, 'tis great odds but we find
ſome excuſe for neglecting what he ſays—
"He is ignorant and unpolite; or perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated
with his own popularity, and means
his counſels to us as encomiums upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."—Or
if neither of theſe will do,
ſome other artifice muſt be found out, to fix
the blame any where rather than at home. And
if in the midſt of a thouſand mortifications, we
can but find out one gentleman of fortune, ſenſe,
and learning, that admires us, we are happy.
A ſingle diamond is worth more than a whole
load of pebbles; and we perhaps adapt, with
vaſt ſatisfaction, the celebrated words of <hi>Arbuſcula</hi>

more in a Chriſtian Orator.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, what I intend by all this, is
to ſhew that you gentlemen may have it in
your power to do a great deal to correct
theſe miſtaken notions. If we plainly ſee that
you regard us, not merely according to the
manner in which our performances are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to your own private taſte, but
according to our deſire and capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uſeful to the publick intereſt, we ſhall
perhaps be taught to place our point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
right; and when that is once done,
a moderate degree of genius, application, and
prudence, may be ſufficient, by the bleſſing of
God, to ſecure the reſt.</p>
            <p>I would here, Sir, have ended my Letter,
but the hints you give in the concluſion of
yours concerning <hi>Academical Education,</hi> lead me
to add a few words on that head. I would
be far from the inſolence of pretending to
teach tutors; but I apprehend that if my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
principles be allow'd, it will follow, by
the eaſieſt conſequence in the world, that it
is a very important part of their buſineſs, to
form their pupils to a regard for the people,
and to a manner of preaching, and of converſe,
which may be agreeable to them.</p>
            <p>There is hardly any thing which ſhould be
more diſcouraged in a young ſtudent, than
ſuch a miſtaken haughty way of thinking, as I
ſo freely deſcribed a little above, eſpecially when
it diſcovers itſelf in a petulant inclination to
employ their talent at ſatyr, in ridiculing the
infirmities of plain ſerious Chriſtians, or the
labours of thoſe miniſters, who are willing to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0417901000:34"/>
condeſcend to the meaneſt capacities, that they
may be wiſe to win ſouls.</p>
            <p>A young man of ſenſe will eaſily enter into
ſuch plain reaſonings as I have offered in the
beginning of this Letter, and be convinced by
them, that if he ever appear under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a diſſenting miniſter, he muſt not
neglect the people. But it is greatly to be
deſired, that our ſtudents may be engaged to
regard them, not merely from political, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
views.</p>
            <p>It is therefore, no doubt, the care of every
pious tutor amongſt us, (and may God make
it a more conſtant and ſucceſsful care) to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
his pupils, who are deſign'd for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
with a deep and early ſenſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of the goſpel-ſcheme, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of man from the ruins of the apoſtacy,
and his reſtoration to God, and happineſs by
a mediator.—To ſhew (as it may eaſily be
ſhewn) that this has been the great end of
the divine counſels, with regard to which, the
harmony of nature in the lower world has
been ſupported, and the various oeconomies of
providence diſpoſed:—To point out the
Son of God deſcending from heaven in favour
of this deſign, purſuing it by humble conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions
for the loweſt of the people, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
labours amongſt them; and at laſt,
eſtabliſhing it by agonies and death:—To
ſhew them the Apoſtles taking up their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
cauſe, proſecuting it with unwearied vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and reſolution, and ſacrificing to it their
eaſe, their reputation, their liberty, and their
lives:—To trace out thoſe generous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
of ſoul, which ſtill live and breathe
in their immortal writings:—And then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0417901000:35"/>
(when their minds are warmed with ſuch a
ſurvey) to apply to the ſtudents themſelves,
as perſons deſigned by Providence, to engage
in the ſame work, to ſupport and carry on
the ſame intereſt, who therefore muſt be
acted by the ſame views, and imbibe the ſame
ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Something of this kind is, I doubt not, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to; and I muſt take the liberty to ſay,
that I think theſe the moſt important lectures
a tutor can read. You cannot but ſee, Sir,
that by the bleſſing of God, ſuch addreſſes
muſt have an apparent tendency to fill the
mind with ſublime and elevated views, and to
make a man feel and own too, (though it may
appear ſomething unpolite) that the ſalvation of
one ſoul, is of infinitely greater importance,
than charming a thouſand ſplendid aſſemblies,
with the moſt elegant diſcourſes that were ever
delivered. A young miniſter under theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
will come out to his publick work
<hi>naturally diſpoſed to care for the ſtate of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>;
and ſuch ſincere zeal and tenderneſs will
form him to a popular addreſs, abundantly
ſooner, and more happily, than the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
rules which it is poſſible to dictate.</p>
            <p>As examples are the beſt illuſtration of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
it muſt certainly be a great advantage
to pupils to hear ſuch preaching, and ſee ſuch
paſtoral care, as is recommended to them in
the lecture-room. A prudent man, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the education of young miniſters,
will be particularly careful to avoid thoſe faults
in preaching, which they are in the greateſt
danger of falling into; and particularly too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
a train of reaſoning, and too great a
care about the little ornaments of ſpeech, when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0417901000:36"/>
addreſſing to a common auditory. And if
(where other circumſtances may allow it) he
ſometimes engage the attendance of ſenior pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils
in his paſtoral viſits, and introduce them
to the acquaintance and freedom of ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Chriſtians in the ſociety, it may be much
for their improvement. A more intimate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their hidden worth, and perhaps of
thoſe noble traces of natural genius, which
they might diſcover amongſt ſome of a very
low education, would ſomething increaſe their
eſteem for the populace in general. And from
their obſervations on books and ſermons,
and their accounts of the various exerciſes of
their minds, (where our politer hearers are
generally more reſerv'd) a man may beſt learn
how they are to be addreſs'd, and form him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to that experimental ſtrain, on which ſo
much of his acceptance and uſefulneſs amongſt
us will depend.</p>
            <p>If you apprehend, Sir, that ſuch a courſe
will make them preachers for the vulgar, <hi>and
for them only</hi>; I think it ſufficient to anſwer,
that I intirely agree with you in what you ſay
of the great advantages of an intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the learned languages, and
the claſſical writers both of the <hi>Romans</hi> and
<hi>Greeks.</hi> I heartily wiſh our ſtudents may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be well furniſhed with it before they
leave the ſchools, and think it highly proper
it ſhould be carried on through the whole of
their academical courſe. And I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that a man of tolerable ſenſe, who is
every day converſing with ſome of the fineſt
writers of antiquity, and who is (as moſt of
our ſtudents are) a little exerciſed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
ſciences, (to teach him attention of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0417901000:37"/>
thought, and ſtrength, and perſpicuity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning)
will be in great danger of ſaying any
thing remarkably impertinent, or contemptibly
low.</p>
            <p>As for being maſters of our own language,
'tis a point which I think ſhould be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
labour'd from the very beginning of their
education. They ſhould to be ſure make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
familiarly acquainted with thoſe writers,
which are allowed to be the ſtandards of it,
and ſhould frequently be tranſlating and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing.
And if this be not only practiſed at
ſchool, but continued through four or five
years of academical education, they will have
formed a habit of expreſſing themſelves grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
or at leaſt tolerably well: So that in
their ordinary compoſures, when they have
digeſted their materials, and ranged their
thoughts, they will often find proper, expreſſive,
and elegant words, flowing in faſter than they
can write them.</p>
            <p>And as compoſition is far from being the
only buſineſs of an orator; ſo I heartily wiſh,
that not only tutors, but ſchool-maſters (whoſe
character and conduct, by the way, is of
vaſt importance to our intereſt) would make
a very ſerious buſineſs of teaching lads, who
are deſign'd for the miniſtry, to read well,
and to pronounce properly and handſomely.
Thus an early remedy would be provided
on the one hand, againſt thoſe unnatural
tones and geſtures, which (as you well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve)
<note n="*" place="bottom">Enq. p. 43.</note>
               <hi>are a grand cauſe of our reproach and
contempt</hi>; and on the other, againſt that
cold inſenſible air, which ſometimes, amongſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0417901000:38"/>
ſtrangers at leaſt, affects even the moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the preacher.</p>
            <p>I think ſome care ſhould be taken, both at the
ſchool and the academy, to engage ſtudents to a
genteel and complaiſant behaviour, not only as
what is apparently conducive to their mutual
eaſe and pleaſure, and the convenience of the
family where they are; but as what may
render them more agreeable and uſeful in
life, to perſons of ſuperior rank, and even
to the populace themſelves. For a well-bred
man knows how to condeſcend, in the moſt
obliging way; and the common people (ſuch
is either their good ſenſe or their humour)
are peculiarly pleas'd with the viſits and
converſe of thoſe, who they know may be
welcome to greater company.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I have done with my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and muſt conclude, with aſſuring you,
that it is not the deſign of one line which
I have writ, merely to prove, that you are
miſtaken in any thing that you have aſſerted;
and therefore I have purpoſely avoided many
citations from your Letter, which might eaſily
have been connected with what I have ſaid.
You will infer from what you have read, that
I differ from you in ſome other particulars,
which are not mention'd, but they apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depend on what I have debated at large;
and I choſe to omit them, not only becauſe
my Letter is already longer than I intended,
but from a general obſervation, which I have
had frequent occaſion to make; that if a
man deſires to do good by what he ſays,
he muſt oppoſe and contradict as little as
poſſible. If I am miſtaken in what I have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0417901000:39"/>
advanced, I ſhall be heartily thankful for
better information; and, if it come from
you, it will be peculiarly agreeable, as I ſhall
have nothing to fear from your reproaches,
and much to hope from your arguments.</p>
