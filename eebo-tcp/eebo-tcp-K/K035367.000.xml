            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following <q>Declaration of the People's natural Right to a Share in the Legiſlature</q> is founded on Principles, which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly unqueſtionable, and cannot eaſily be controverted; but I was not aware, I acknowledge,<note n="(1)" place="bottom">
                  <p>I freely acknowledge my deficiency in <hi>hiſtorical</hi> as well as moſt other branches of Learning, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much reading and leiſure to be obtained; but though this affords an argument againſt <hi>my own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal credit and abilities, in general,</hi> as a writer, yet it does not at all affect any particular point, which, in my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tracts, I have laboured to maintain; for, upon theſe, a candid Reader will determine according to the evidence produced, and not by the general character or <hi>demerit</hi> of the Author in other reſpects.</p>
               </note> when I ſent the ſame to the Preſs, that there had ever been any Controverſy before the 6th of King George I. concerning the Freedom of our fellow-ſubjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or that any Engliſhman, acquainted with the principles of our excellent Conſtitution of State, had ever, before that time, preſumed to advance any doctrine which might tend to deprive our Iriſh Brethren
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:1198200100:4"/>of their <hi>natural Freedom,</hi> and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable benefits of that happy legal Conſtitution, which Britiſh Subjects in general are commonly ſuppoſed to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by <hi>Birth-right!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I had not eſteemed this point <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertible,</hi> when I wrote the ſaid <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> I ſhould not have quoted the Union between <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as an example of <q>
                  <hi>the true conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> mode of <hi>connecting Britiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions</hi> that are otherwiſe <hi>ſeparated by nature.</hi>
               </q> But having done this, and having alſo given ſeveral copies of the Declaration to my friends which cannot now be recalled, I have thereby brought upon myſelf the neceſſity of maintaining the propriety of the ſaid example, which might as eaſily have been avoided, had I been aware of any ſuch controverſy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the general principles, on which my arguments are founded, would have been amply ſufficient (I apprehend) to prove the truth of my <hi>Declaration,</hi> even though <hi>Examples</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> had been againſt it; for the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> teaches us, that examples and precedents are not to be followed if they are <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> or inconſiſtent with
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:1198200100:5"/>
               <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>conſtitutional</hi> Principles<note n="(2)" place="bottom">
                  <p>This is clearly proved by a variety of unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable maxims;
<q>
                        <l>Judicandum eſt <hi>Legibus, non Exemplis.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Malus uſus abolendus eſt.</l>
                     </q>
                     <q>In conſuetudinibus non diuturnitas temporis, ſod <hi>ſoliditas rationis,</hi> conſideranda eſt.</q>
                     <q>Multitudo <hi>errantium</hi> non parit <hi>errori</hi> patroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</q>
                  </p>
               </note>; though, on the other hand, they are to be eſteemed of very great weight and authority in Law, when there are <hi>no juſt exceptions</hi> againſt them<note n="(3)" place="bottom">
                  <q>— et quia conſuetudines illae <hi>nec contra legem divinam nec contra rationem</hi> in aliquo exiſtunt, et pro bono communi totius Regni ex earum diurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate cenſentur, fore neceſſariae, <hi>vim Legis retinent,</hi> &amp;c. <bibl>Doct. et Stud. c. 7.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </note>. And of this latter kind is the Example which I have quoted to illuſtrate my Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for, though many great and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Writers have made <hi>exceptions</hi> to the conſtitutional Freedom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which I had ſuppoſed to be unqueſtionable, yet, after the moſt careful examination of their opinions, and the <hi>reaſons</hi> given for the ſame, (in which the proofs ought to conſiſt,) I am now fully convinced that there are <hi>no juſt exceptions</hi> againſt that example; and, conſequently, I am bound in juſtice, to my fellow-ſubjects in <hi>Ireland</hi> not to give it up; becauſe the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1198200100:6"/>
               <hi>"neceſſity"</hi> (beforementioned) <q>of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>propriety of the example,</hi>
               </q> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my Declaration, ariſes not from any obſtinate partiality to my own aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, (which I confeſs was, at firſt, too haſtily and unadviſedly made,) but from a firm perſuaſion, after a moſt cautious enquiry into the real ſtate of the controverſy, that the advocates for the Liberties of <hi>Ireland</hi> have Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on their ſide, which, (I hope) the 2d Part, now added to my Declaration, will ſufficiently teſtify.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary alſo for me to guard againſt another objection which might perhaps hereafter have been ſtarted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the following <hi>Declaration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have quoted therein a maxim of the Engliſh Conſtitution, as a principle of <hi>natural equity,</hi> which had previouſly been denied that rank by one of the moſt eminent civilians of his time; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to avoid the influence of ſo great an authority againſt my Argument, I think it prudent, in this Preface, to examine the grounds of his objections, that my Readers may have ſufficient evidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them to diſtinguiſh where the truth lies; for it is certainly neceſſary for me
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1198200100:7"/>to eſtabliſh the firſt <hi>principles</hi> on which I have proceeded, before I can expect to have any attention paid to the Arguments which I have built upon them.</p>
            <p>The maxim which I wiſh to maintain is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi> that <q>Law, to bind all, muſt be aſſented to by all<note n="(4)" place="bottom">
                     <p>Principia Leg. et Aequit. p. 56. to which is added, by way of illuſtration, <q>Canons therefore bind not the Laity.</q>
                     </p>
                  </note>.</q> This maxim I have quoted in the following Declaration as a principle of <hi>natural Equity;</hi> though, it ſeems, the learned Civilian, Baron Puffendorf, has expreſſly refuſed to rank it with the <hi>Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> He, or (rather I ſhould ſay) his Tranſlator, calls<note n="(5)" place="bottom">
                  <p>The Edition which I have followed is only an Engliſh tranſlation printed at Oxford in 1710.</p>
               </note> it only <hi>a notion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"We cannot here but obſerve," (ſays he,) <q>that the <hi>Notion,</hi> maintained by ſome authors, <hi>That the Conſent of the People is requiſite to make Laws oblige the Subject in Conſcience,</hi> is neither true <hi>in the Laws of Nature,</hi> nor in the civil Laws of monarchical or of ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Rulers; nor indeed at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be underſtood of implicit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; as a man, by agreeing to the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1198200100:8"/>Sovereignty of another, is at the ſame time, ſuppoſed to have agreed to all the future Acts of that Sovereignty<note n="(6)" place="bottom">Law of Nature and Nations, Book 1. c. 6. p. 55.</note>.</q> (He has nevertheleſs thought proper to add an obſervation which makes ſtrongly againſt his own argument.) "Though it would really be very uſeful," (ſays he,) <q>and contribute much to engaging the Subjects in a <hi>voluntary Obedience,</hi> if the Laws could be made <hi>with their Conſent</hi> and Approbation; eſpecially ſuch as are to paſs into their Lives and Manners.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now it would be impoſſible (I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend) to find ſo juſt a reaſon in favour of the former part of the learned Baron's aſſertion, as he himſelf has here given <hi>directly againſt it;</hi> and yet he is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harping upon the ſame harſh ſtring of abſolute implicit obedience; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency cannot eaſily be accounted for, unleſs it be attributed to <hi>the prejudice of his education</hi> as a ſtudent in <hi>the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial or Civil Law.</hi> For though the Civil Law contains many excellent max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims highly worthy of our eſteem, moſt of which have been adopted by our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1198200100:9"/>Engliſh writers of the Common Law of this Kingdom<note n="(7)" place="bottom">
                  <q>What uſe our anceſtors have made of the civil Law will readily appear to any one, that will take the trouble to compare the ſeveral works, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that voluminous body, with ſome of the moſt ancient Engliſh Lawyers, as Glanvil, Bracton, and others; who have adhered very cloſely to the rules and method of Juſtinian; have tranſcribed his Laws in their own proper language, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times entire titles, as familiarly as if they were the original Laws of England. <bibl>Dr. Bever's Diſcourſe on the Study of Juris-prudence and the Civil Law, p. 17.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </note>; yet it includes ſome heterogeneous poſitions (that have been forced upon it by the overbearing influence and corrupt practices of unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Imperial Courts) which are highly unreaſonable and contradictory to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral equity of its other principles. A poſition of this kind, too implicitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as Law, ſeems to be the ground-work of the learned Baron's difficulty: I mean that <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and dangerous poſition of the Civil Law, which attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Prince's <hi>Will and Pleaſure</hi> the <hi>Force</hi> of Law<note n="(8)" place="bottom">

                  </q>
                  <p>In this ſame chapter the learned Chancellor Forteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue recites many dreadful effects of this abominable
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1198200100:10"/>principle in the Government and Police of <hi>France.</hi> viz. the pernicious and dangerous Policy of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>ſtanding army;</hi> for which the people were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to provide quarters and proviſions, in all the great towns and villages.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the abominable oppreſſion of the Salt Tax, whereby the poor were compelled to purchaſe of the King a certain quantity of <hi>Salt</hi> (whether they choſe to have it or not) at an exceſſive price; by which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the aſſeſſments <hi>to pay the troops,</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious other tallage rateable at the <hi>King's pleaſure,</hi> the common people were reduced to extreme penury, and want of every comfort in life. And, with reſpect to perſons of highter rank, if any Nobleman or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was accuſed of a crime, even by his enemies, he was liable to be dragged to a <hi>private examination,</hi> by the intermediation of meſſengers in the King's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or elſewhere, in a private place, without ſeeing his accuſers (himſelf alone being ſeen); and when the King (or perhaps his Miniſter) has <hi>been pleaſed</hi> to judge him guilty, the poor <hi>paſſive Subject</hi> is popped into a ſack, and in the night time caſt into the river by the Marſhal's ſervants. Howſoever incredible ſuch abominable injuſtice may appear to Engliſhmen, yet the worthy Chancellor, who wrote this account for the inſtruction of Edward Prince of Wales (the ſon of King Henry VI.) when in France, appeals to the young Prince's <hi>own knowledge</hi> of the notoriety of ſuch facts: "You have heard," (ſays he) <q>that more men (by much) have died in this manner than by the ordinary courſe of juſtice; yet nevertheleſs</q> (ſays he ironically) <q>
                        <hi>whatſoever hath pleaſed the King (according to the Civil Law) has the force of Law.</hi> And while you have been in France, and in the neighbourhood of that Kingdom,</q> (continues the
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1198200100:11"/>Chancellor to the young Prince,) <q>you have heard of other <hi>enormities</hi> like to theſe, and ſome even worſe than theſe —<hi>deteſtably</hi> and <hi>damnably perpetrated,</hi> no otherwiſe than under the colour (or pretence) of <hi>that Law, viz.</hi> Quod Principi placuit (juxta Leges Civiles) legis habet vigorem.</q>

<pb n="x" facs="tcp:1198200100:12"/>ſuch <hi>private executions</hi> can be attributed to nothing but a DIABOLICAL DEPRAVITY in the minds of thoſe who order them.</p>

<pb n="x" facs="tcp:1198200100:12"/>the ſame chapter, where he is defining the difference between <hi>Law</hi> and ſome
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:1198200100:13"/>other things, which ſeem to bear relation to it; as <hi>Counſel,</hi> which requires <hi>reaſons</hi> to produce an <hi>obligation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>"But <hi>Law,</hi>" (ſays he,) <q>though it ought not to want its <hi>reaſons,</hi> yet theſe <hi>reaſons</hi> are not the cauſe why obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is paid to it, <hi>but the power of the Exactor;</hi> who, when he has ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his <hi>pleaſure,</hi> lays an <hi>obligation</hi> on the <hi>Subjects</hi> to act in conformity to his decree, though perhaps they do not ſo well apprehend the <hi>reaſons</hi> of the injunction,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, after citing a ſimilar paſſage from Mr. Hobbs, he adds,
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:1198200100:14"/>
               <q>For no man can ſay, <hi>ſic volo, ſic ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo;</hi> ſo I will, and ſo I command; unleſs,</q>

            <p>"We obey Laws, therefore," (ſays he,) <q>not principally upon account of the matter of them, but upon account of <hi>the Legiſlator's Will</hi> 
                  <note n="(9)" place="bottom">Book 1. chap. 6. §. 1.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the learned Civilian ſeems to conſider <hi>the Will and Pleaſure</hi> of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign as the life and ſpirit of Laws; which <hi>notion</hi> is highly <hi>unreaſonable</hi> in every caſe but one, <hi>viz.</hi> when we are ſpeaking of the Laws of that Sovereign alone, whoſe <hi>Will</hi> is the fountain of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Pleaſure</hi> (by our own natural <hi>Reaſon</hi> we are convinced) is infinite <hi>goodneſs, juſtice,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all thoſe to whom he has ſignified his commands; becauſe we cannot ſeparate the <hi>idea</hi> of infallible <hi>Reaſon, Wiſdom,</hi> and eternal <hi>Juſtice,</hi> from any command of divine authority.</p>
            <p>And yet this application of the Baron's doctrine, even to the <hi>ſupreme</hi> Law, is not conformable throughout to what I
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:1198200100:15"/>underſtand in this place of the Baron's idea of <hi>Law;</hi> for he aſſigns no other <q>cauſe why obedience is paid to it, but the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>the Exactor;</hi>
               </q> whereas God's Laws have many other apparent <hi>cauſes</hi> of <hi>obligation,</hi> of which I have alteady mentioned the due ſenſe we <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi> entertain of the infinite <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> (as well as <hi>the Power</hi>) of the Divine Author, who is ſo far from being <hi>an Exactor</hi> of <hi>Laws,</hi> that the revelation of his will for the good government of mankind has generally been addreſſed to the <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Men, that their <hi>Covenant</hi> with God might be founded on <hi>free Conſent,</hi> the higheſt and moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory <hi>Cauſe of Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as the Laws of God are thus tendered to us under the equitable form of a <hi>reciprocal Covenant,</hi> thereby bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even himſelf (the ſupreme Lord and Creator of all things) to us, his poor mortal ſubjects, under <hi>conditional Promiſes</hi> which cannot fail on his part! how much more ought all mere <hi>worldly</hi> Governors to be reſtrained and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by equitable <hi>Covenants</hi> of <hi>mutual obligation</hi> between them and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſince their <hi>equality</hi> in nature gives
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:1198200100:16"/>the latter an undoubted Right to inſiſt on this, the only ſafe mode of worldly Government?</p>
            <p>The conſideration of this point leads me to one of the principal Grounds of Baron Puffendorf's Miſtake, beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>He does not ſeem to have been aware, that, in all ſocieties of men governed by <hi>Laws,</hi> ſome ſort of <hi>general Covenant</hi> muſt be underſtood to ſubſiſt between the ſeveral <hi>Sovereigns</hi> and their <hi>Subjects</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively: and, though ſuch <hi>Covenants</hi> are not always <hi>expreſſed,</hi> yet, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, they are always <hi>implied;</hi> becauſe we muſt neceſſarily preſume, that <hi>the Good of the People</hi> is the original intention and principal end of all <hi>legal</hi> human Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, ſince <hi>all Men are naturally equals,</hi> and <hi>a Man</hi> who ſubmits himſelf to the Sovereignty or Government of another, that he may enjoy the benefit and protection of ſociety, does not, on that account, ceaſe to be <hi>a Man;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the temporal Sovereign himſelf be releaſed from the <hi>natural</hi> Tyes of <hi>that Relation:</hi> for, whenever he forgets that he himſelf is <hi>a Man,</hi> (of the ſame falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble underſtanding and natural infirmities
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:1198200100:17"/>with his Subjects, who are his <hi>equals</hi> both on their <hi>entrance</hi> and at their <hi>exeunt</hi> from the Stage of Life,) he immediately loſes the beſt Rule for his Conduct as <hi>a Prince,</hi> and neceſſarily degenerates into <hi>brutality;</hi> ſo that, in ſuch caſes, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that THE WILL <hi>of the Prince</hi> is to be allowed <hi>the force of Law</hi> is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt abſurdity! Nay, even the Baron himſelf has elſewhere declared, that <q>the word MAN, is thought to carry ſomewhat of <hi>Dignity</hi> in its ſound; and we commonly</q> (ſays he) <q>make uſe of this as the laſt and the moſt prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing argument againſt a rude inſulter, <hi>I am not a Beaſt, a Dog, but I am</hi> A MAN <hi>as well as yourſelf.</hi> Since then <hi>human</hi> nature agrees <hi>equally</hi> to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſince no one can live a ſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life with another, who does not own and reſpect him as <hi>a Man;</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as a command of the Law of Nature, <hi>that</hi> EVERY MAN <hi>eſteem and treat</hi> ANOTHER as one who is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly HIS EQUAL, or who is A MAN as well as he.</q> (Book 3. c. 2. p. 178.) It would therefore be unreaſonable to conceive, that any ſociety of MEN ſhould voluntarily ſubmit themſelves to a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:1198200100:18"/>Sovereign, without ſuppoſing, at the ſame time, ſome <hi>reciprocal obligation</hi> or <hi>duty</hi> to ſubſiſt between them; which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the <hi>implication</hi> of a mutual <hi>Covenant:</hi> and, indeed, the formalities of every Coronation ſufficiently indicate and warrant ſuch an <hi>implication;</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringements made by Monarchs on ſuch <hi>implied Covenants</hi> have, in all ages, been occaſionally puniſhed by the expulſion and deſtruction of the Tyrants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of which moſt nations have, at ſome time or other, afforded an example.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, the learned Baron ſeems to have neglected theſe neceſſary conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; for he aſſerts, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between a <hi>Compact</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> and a <hi>Law,</hi> is obvious. <q>For a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact</hi>
               </q> (ſays he) <q>is a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> but a <hi>Law</hi> is a <hi>Command.</hi> In Compacts the form of ſpeaking is <hi>I will</hi> do ſo and ſo; but in Law the form runs, <hi>do thou ſo,</hi> after an imperative manner.</q> Book 1. c. 6. §. 2. p. 47.</p>
            <p>He had before been ſpeaking of demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Governments, and had remarked, not only that the ancients <q>frequently apply to Laws the name of <hi>common Agreements,</hi>
               </q> but alſo, that "the Laws"
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:1198200100:19"/>(among the Grecians) <q>were made upon the propoſal of the Magiſtrate, with the Knowledge, and <hi>by the Command of the People,</hi> and ſo</q> (as it were) "in the way of <hi>bargain or ſtipulation,</hi>" (ſays he,) <q>they gave them the name of <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Agreements</hi> beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:</q> and yet he will not allow (notwithſtanding ſuch authority) that they are properly ſtiled <hi>"Covenants,"</hi> having puzzled himſelf with the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a national <hi>Covenant</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi> of individuals; <q>for, in this laſt caſe,</q> (ſays he,) <q>a perſon that <hi>diſſents is not bound,</hi> and the party cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without him; whereas, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>caſe,</hi> even the <hi>diſſenting Party</hi> is tied and obliged by the plurality of votes.</q> Now the learned Baron has not been aware that this very reaſon, which he himſelf has aſſigned, confirms the propriety of that ancient cuſtom which he condemns, (<hi>viz.</hi> the applying the name of <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Agreements</hi> to <hi>Laws,</hi>) for, he allows, that <q>the <hi>diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Party</hi> is tied and obliged by <hi>the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of votes,</hi>
               </q> and therefore, even a whole nation, in that caſe, may be ſaid to act as <hi>an individual;</hi> becauſe, <q>
                  <hi>that to
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:1198200100:20"/>which the greater number give conſent</hi>
               </q> (as he himſelf remarks in the preceding paragraph) <q>
                  <hi>is taken</hi> for the <hi>Will and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of all;</hi>
               </q> ſo that, by this means, a <hi>whole Nation</hi> is as capable of making a <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Compact</hi> as an <hi>Individual;</hi> and I will only add, to what the Baron has allowed about the <hi>binding</hi> of <hi>thoſe who diſſent,</hi> that they are bound <hi>only ſo far</hi> as the impoſed <hi>Obligation</hi> is conſiſtent with their <hi>ſuperior Covenant</hi> and duty to God, which is always to be <hi>implied:</hi> for even the SOVEREIGN of <hi>the World,</hi> THE KING OF KINGS, who alone can be ſaid to have an <hi>abſolute Right</hi> to govern his creature man <hi>without a free Covenant;</hi> (if he had been pleaſed ſo to do,) has nevertheleſs condeſcended to include all his poſitive <hi>Laws</hi> in two expreſs <hi>legal Covenants,</hi> the <hi>old</hi> and the <hi>new,</hi> both of which have been from time to time confirmed and fulfilled, and ſtill reſpectively ſubſiſt to this day in all points, wherein the former is not ſuperſeded, and fulfilled by the latter. It therefore ill becomes this learned Civilian to ſeparate the idea of a <hi>Compact</hi> or <hi>Covenant from Law;</hi> and more eſpecially when he endeavours thereby to eſtabliſh <q>
                  <hi>the Power of the
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:1198200100:21"/>Exactor,</hi>
               </q> the capricious <hi>Will</hi> of mere temporal fallible Sovereigns, which he ſuppoſes to be <hi>Law,</hi> independent of all <hi>Compacts</hi> or <hi>Covenants</hi> expreſſed or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied!</p>
            <p>Thus I hope I have traced, to the very foundation, the Baron's error in denying the principle or maxim beforementioned, (concerning the neceſſity of popular <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> in Legiſlation,) for, if he had not attempted to ſeparate the idea of a <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> from <hi>Law,</hi> he could not have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the abſolute <hi>illegality</hi> of thoſe pretended Laws which are ordained only by the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>
                  <q>Power of the Exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor!</q>
               </hi> becauſe the meaneſt profeſſor of the Engliſh common Law would have told him, that every ſubmiſſion, <hi>promiſe,</hi> or <hi>agreement,</hi> that is <hi>extorted</hi> by <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>compulſion,</hi> is (according to the <hi>Law of Nature</hi>) totally <hi>null and void in itſelf;</hi> and he himſelf is ſufficiently ſenſible of this in another place<note n="(10)" place="bottom">
                  <q>Thoſe <hi>promiſes</hi> then, or <hi>pacts,</hi> we take to be <hi>invalid,</hi> which a man is <hi>compelled</hi> to engage in, by the <hi>unjuſt force</hi> of the party to whom they are made; for ſince he, who <hi>extorts</hi> any thing from another by uſing unjuſt terrours, is <hi>by the Law of Nature</hi> bound to reſtore it, and muſt conſequently make good what the other perſon loſes by ſuch forced bargain, the neceſſity of <hi>Reparation,</hi> in the party who offered the violence, <hi>takes off</hi> ALL OBLIGATION <hi>to payment in the party who ſuffered it,</hi> &amp;c. <bibl>Book 3. c. 6. § 11. p. 225.</bibl>

<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:1198200100:22"/>an oath ſhould be obtained to confirm the unjuſt <hi>"Power of the Exactor,"</hi> it will not increaſe his Right; for the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's own doctrine (again in another part of his book) affords a ſufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to annul every pretence of <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on account of <q>

                     <q>But what are we to think of <hi>oaths</hi> extorted by <hi>unjuſt Fear?</hi> Surely the Perſon who, by means of this <hi>Fear,</hi> procured a promiſe <hi>upon oath,</hi> is no leſs obliged to <hi>releaſe the promiſe,</hi> thus violently obtained, than <hi>if no oath had been</hi> added to confirm it.

            </p>
            <p>In my former Tract I remarked, that <q>the Law will not excuſe an <hi>unlawful Act committed by a</hi> SOLDIER, even though he commits it by <hi>the expreſs Command</hi> of the higheſt <hi>military Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in the Kingdom,</q>

                        </q> — Agreeable to this doctrine was the anſwer of Dr. Sharp, archbiſhop of York, when the queſtion was put to him, <q>How a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who had ſworn Allegiance to King James, could, with a good conſcience, take the ſame oath to King William?</q> To which he replied, <q>That the Laws of the land are the only rule of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in this matter, and we are no further bound to pay obedience to governors, nor to any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, than the Laws enjoin. If, therefore, King William, in the eye of the Law, be our King, we muſt in conſcience pay obedience to him as ſuch. I take this</q> (ſays he) <q>for a certain truth, that, <hi>as the Law makes the King,</hi> ſo the ſame <hi>Law</hi> extends, or limits, or <hi>transfers,</hi> our obedience and allegiance; and all Oaths impoſed by the Law oblige the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience no further than the Law meant they ſhould oblige.

                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>I have alſo ſent you a book lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Dr. —, reſpecting the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Britiſh Colonies.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of my ſending the latter is not becauſe I approve of it, or have the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1198200100:76"/>leaſt connexion with the author; but, on the contrary, that you and your friends in America may be aware of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional doctrines which are thereby propagated amongſt us. I have not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had opportunity to peruſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly; neither do I now think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to do ſo; for I was lucky enough, when I firſt took it up, to turn over a few pages in the fourth part, containing five propoſitions upon the point in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the author's ſentiments and intentions may be ſufficiently known without deſcending to his arguments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; for <hi>not one</hi> of them (not even the 5th and laſt, which he himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers) can poſſibly be reconciled either to <hi>Law, Equity,</hi> or <hi>ſound Politicks;</hi> ſo that if the doctor, with the <hi>ſame neglect of Law and conſtitutional Principles,</hi> had multiplied his propoſitions to the number of <hi>an hundred times five,</hi> he would not have been able to lay down a plan or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1198200100:77"/>mode of government tolerably ſuitable to the caſe before him; becauſe, in this, as in many other things, there is but, <hi>one right,</hi> though very many <hi>wrong</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of proceeding; and the doctor has unfortunately forgot to ſtate the <hi>only right propoſition</hi> upon the ſubject in queſtion, that can be admitted conſiſtently with the neceſſary principles abovementioned of <hi>Law, Equity, and ſound Politicks;</hi> viz. to <hi>do juſtice</hi> to our brethren of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; that is, to govern them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the eſtabliſhed Principles of the Engliſh Conſtitution, and known Laws of the Land, and candidly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their <hi>unalienable</hi> right to the ſame happy privileges by which the liberties of the mother-country have hitherto been maintained; the moſt eſſential of which is the privilege of paying no other taxes than what are voluntarily granted by <hi>the people</hi> or their <hi>legal repreſentatives</hi> in general councils or parliaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1198200100:78"/>Dr.—is inexcuſable for having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this <hi>ſixth Propoſition!</hi> for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant of the legal and <hi>eſtabliſhed mode of extending the Engliſh Conſtitution to countries detached from this iſland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have a ſtanding precedent and example (which has long ſubſiſted, and has been univerſally allowed) in the preſent government of <hi>Ireland;</hi> for that iſland, though unjuſtly <hi>conquered</hi> by our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, enjoys (or, at leaſt, is allowed to be entitled to) the ſame conſtitutional privileges as the ſeat of empire, England itſelf. The reſpective Parliaments of the two iſlands are <hi>entirely independent of each other;</hi> they <hi>ſeparately</hi> grant, from time to time, the neceſſary ſupplies to the ſtate; and no man may preſume to deny their right of enquiring reſpectively into the application of them. But, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this diſtinct oeconomy, and the entire independency of the natives or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1198200100:79"/>ſubjects, with reſpect to each other, yet they are firmly united, by the <hi>bands of allegiance,</hi> to <hi>one</hi> Head (or Monarchy) of <hi>limited power,</hi> whereby they enjoy the privileges of the <hi>ſame reaſonable common Law,</hi> and the <hi>ſame excellent Conſtitution</hi> of ſtate: ſo that the equality of <hi>privilege</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> renders the <hi>Union</hi> more juſt and equitable, and conſequently more ſafe and durable, than it could poſſibly have been made by any other means.</p>
               <p>And the inhabitants of both iſlands (though ſprung from a variety of jarring, jealous, and fierce nations) have, by this means, acquired a certain <hi>mutual conſideration</hi> for each other, as <hi>fellow-ſubjects,</hi> which could never have been produced by mere alliances, guarantees, or defenſive leagues, nor perhaps by any other mode of government whatever, than that by which Divine Providence has effected it; <hi>viz.</hi> the Engliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1198200100:80"/>This has firmly united the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the two iſlands; whereby reciprocal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in time of need is inſured to both. This <hi>eſtabliſhed example</hi> of the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional mode of connecting Britiſh Dominions, that are otherwiſe ſeparated by Nature, will enable us, by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to diſcern the illegality and injuſtice of Dr.—'s five Propoſitions. The ſtately vine of Britiſh Dominion (if I may uſe that ſcriptural type) has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially extended its luxuriant branches to the moſt diſtant parts of the earth! and will continue to ſpread and increaſe as long as <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>the Laws of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> are duly maintained by thoſe who are entruſted with the adminiſtration of government (unleſs the wickedneſs of <hi>individuals,</hi> manifeſted by the exerciſe of <hi>domeſtic Slavery</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and of <hi>political Corruption and Venality</hi> at home, with the <hi>growing vices</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1198200100:82"/>But if (according to Dr.—'s 5th propoſition) the flouriſhing branches of North-America were to be <hi>entirely ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> from the trunk, and excluded from the <hi>circle</hi> of the royal <hi>diadem,</hi> the effect would be <hi>reciprocally humiliating;</hi> for the act of ſeparation would, at the ſame time, unavoidably <hi>contract</hi> the <hi>imperial Authority of the Britiſh Empire</hi> to the narrow limits of Britiſh and Iriſh ground, except a few ſmall Sugar-Iſlands, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled chiefly by the moſt miſerable of ſlaves: ſo that both <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her <hi>Colonies</hi> would reciprocally loſe <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>ſecurity,</hi> by the diſunion.

               <p>If all theſe points are duly conſidered, the very propoſing ſo pernicious a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure muſt appear highly criminal, if not treaſonable! eſpecially as the author has been pleaſed to inſinuate, that there is no alternative!— <q>If we neither can govern the Americans,</q> (ſays he,) <q>nor be governed by them; if we can neither unite with them, nor ought to ſubdue them; what remains</q> (ſays he) <q>but to part with them on as friendly terms as we can?</q> But is it not Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the Crown to inſinuate that the Americans cannot be <hi>governed,</hi> as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1198200100:84"/>well as Treaſon againſt the People at large, to ſay that we cannot <hi>unite</hi> with our American Brethren, when there is a conſtitutional mode both of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> eſtabliſhed by law, and an unqueſtionable precedent, the obſervance of which would undoubtedly ſatisfy every honeſt American Subject?</p>
               <p>The advocates for the juriſdiction of the Britiſh <hi>Parliament in America,</hi> like all promoters of bad meaſures, will not fail to repreſent thoſe, that oppoſe them, as licentious and diſaffected perſons; and therefore, as it is highly neceſſary for the general <hi>welfare</hi> and ſubſiſtence of the Britiſh Empire, both in Europe, Aſia, and America, (upon the principles already explained,) that we ſhould ſtrictly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our <hi>Loyalty to the Crown,</hi> at the ſame time that we ſteadily aſſert our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and conſtitutional Rights,—I think we ought to loſe no proper opportunity

               <p>WHEN the Firſt Part of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was ſent to the Preſs, I was not aware that there had been any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy before the ſixth of King <hi>George</hi> I. concerning the freedom of our fellow ſubjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or that any Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, acquainted with the principles of

               <p>But I have ſince had the mortification to find, that ſuch great Authorities as Lord Coke, Judge Jenkins, Lord Chief Juſtice Vaughan, Judge Blackſtone, the Honourable Mr. Juſtice Barrington, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might be quoted in favour of a contrary Doctrine! And as I have mentioned the Union between Great-Britain and Ireland in the Firſt Part of this Declaration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as an Example of <q>the true conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al mode of connecting Britiſh Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that are otherwiſe ſeparated by nature,</q> I thought myſelf therefore,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1198200100:92"/>obliged to ſearch and examine the grounds upon which theſe grew and learned men have founded their opinions, that if they ſhould have <hi>Truth</hi> on their ſide, they might have the credit of it; but if not, that the <hi>Truth</hi> of this important queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when plainly and impartially ſtated, might prevent for the future any ſuch undue pretenſions on the one hand, and jealouſies on the other, as have too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occaſioned miſunderſtandings and controverſies between the Subjects of the two Kingdoms.</p>

Whereupon the ſaid A. was warned and appeared, and ſaid, 'That the <hi>land of Ireland, time beyond the memory of man, hath been a land ſeparated and ſevered from the Realm of England,</hi> and ruled and <hi>governed by the cuſtoms and laws of the ſame land of Ireland.</hi> And that the Lords of the ſame land, which are of the King's Council, have uſed, from time to time in the <hi>abſence of the King, to elect a Juſtice,</hi> which Juſtice, ſo elected, hath power to pardon and puniſh all felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, treſpaſſes, <hi>&amp;c. and to aſſemble a Parliament;</hi> and by the advice of the Lords and <hi>Commonalty to make Statutes; and he alledgeth further,</hi> that a Parliament was aſſembled, and that it was ordained by the ſaid Parliament, that every man who had any office with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid land, before a certain day, <hi>and he puts the day in certain.</hi> ſhall occupy the ſaid Office by himſelf, or otherwiſe that he ſhall forfeit his office. <hi>And ſheweth further,</hi> how the ſaid John Pilkington oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied the ſaid office by a deputy, and that, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he came not in proper perſon to reſide upon his office before the day, that his office was void,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1198200100:100"/>and that the King, by his Letters Patents, granted the ſaid office, ſo become void, to the ſaid A. and prayed that the ſaid Letters Patents ſhould be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and not repealed.' And upon the plea the ſaid John Pilkington demurred in law. In the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of which caſe, it was debated by the Judges, Yelverton, Forteſcue, Portington, Markham, and Aſcough, whether the ſaid preſcription were good, or void in law; Yelverton and Portington held the preſcription void; <hi>but Forteſine, Markham, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough,</hi> held the preſcription good, and that the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents made to A. were good and effectual,</hi> and ought not to be repeated: and in the argument of this caſe it was agreed, by Forteſcue and Portington, <hi>that if a tenth or fifteenth be granted by Parliament in England,</hi> that ſhall not <hi>bind them in Ireland;</hi> although the King ſend the ſame <hi>Statute into Ireland under his great ſeal: except they in Ireland will in their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment approve it;</hi> but if they will <hi>approve it, then it ſhall bind in Ireland.</hi> And Portington ſaid, that if a tenth be granted in the Parliament of England, <hi>that ſhall not bind in Ireland,</hi> becauſe they have not any <hi>commandment by writ to come to our Parliament;</hi> and this was not denied by Markham, Yelverton, or Aſcough. Upon this caſe theſe points following are to be obſerved, Firſt, that the Lords of the Council of Ireland had then power, in the <hi>abſence of the King, and vacancy of a Lieutenant or Deputy, to elect a Juſtice.</hi> and that is plainly proved by the preamble of the Statutes of 33d of Hen. VIII. chap. 2. in Ireland. The words are theſe; 'For as much as continually
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1198200100:101"/>ſithens the conqueſt of this Realm of Ireland, it hath been uſed in this ſame Realm of Ireland, that at every ſuch time, as it hath chaunced the ſame Realm to be deſtitute of a Lieutenant, Deputy, Juſtice, or other head Governour, by death, ſurrender, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of the ſaid Realm, or otherwiſe, the Council of this Realm of Ireland, for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have uſed, by the laws and uſages of the ſame, to aſſemble themſelves <hi>together to chooſe and elect a Juſtice, to be Ruler and Governor of this Realm,</hi> till the King's Highneſs had deputed and ordained a Lieutenant, Deputy, or other Governor for the ſame Realm; which Juſtice, ſo being elected, was, and hath been, always by the ancient laws and cuſtoms of this ſaid Realm of Ireland, authoriſed to do and exerciſe the ſaid roume of Deputy there, for the good rule and governance, and leading of the King's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects within the ſaid Realm of Ireland, and in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Juſtice, with divers other authorities, pre-eminences, and juriſdictions there; which uſage, election, and authority of the ſaid Juſtice, hath been many times ratified and confirmed by divers Statutes in this Realm provided and made. But this order of election of a Juſtice is now, by the laid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 33d of Hen. VIII. altered; as by the ſaid Statute more at large may appear.</q>

And yet, alas! he has repeated the ſame in this very page, immediately after the Information, before quoted, concerning the Nobles of Ireland being ſummoned to the Parliament of England; for he adds,—"and <hi>by ſpecial words</hi>" (ſays he) <q>the Parliament of England <hi>may bind the Subjects of Ireland;</hi>

                  <q>by <hi>ſpecial words,</hi>
                  </q> &amp;c. for it amounts to an <hi>implied acknowledgment, upon public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> of the injuſtice of pretending to <hi>"bind the Subjects of Ireland"</hi> without their expreſs conſent; being, in reality, a copy of the King's Writ (before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) to ſummon the <hi>Nobles of Ireland</hi>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1198200100:110"/>that this was really the caſe, is clearly proved by ſome other Engliſh records, cited by Mr. Mollyneux, in his Caſe of Ireland, pp. 73, and 74. whereby it appears, that even <q>Knights of the Shires, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, were elected in the Shires, Cities, and Boroughs, <hi>of Ireland,</hi> to ſerve in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <hi>in England</hi>

                     <p>"Formerly" (ſays Mr. Mollyneux) "when Ireland was but thinly peopled, and the Engliſh laws not fully current in all parts of the Kingdom, it is probable, that then they could not frequently aſſemble with conveniency or ſafety to make laws in their own Parliament at home; and therefore, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the heats of rebellions, or confuſion of the times, they were forced to enact laws in England. But then this was always by their proper Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives: For we find, that in the Reign of Edward the Third, and by what foregoes, it is plain it <hi>was ſo in Edward the Firſt's time; Knights of the Shire, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, were elected in the Shires, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Boroughs of Ireland, to ſerve in Parliament in England;</hi> and have ſo ſerved accordingly. For, amongſt the records of the Tower of London, Roe. Clauſ. 50. Edward the Third, Parl. 2. Memb. 23. we find a writ from the King at Weſtminſter, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to James Butler, Lord Juſtice of Ireland, and to R. Archbiſhop of Dublin, his Chancellor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to iſſue writs, under the great Seal of Ireland, to the ſeveral Counties, Cities, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, for ſatisfying the expences of the men of that land, who laſt came over to ſerve in Parliament in England. And, in another roll, the 50th of Edw. III. Membr. 19. on complaint to the King by John Draper, who was choſen Burgeſs of Cork by writ, and ſerved in the Parliament of England, and yet was denied his expences by ſome of the Citizens, care was taken to reimburſe him.</p>
                     <p>If, from theſe laſt mentioned records, it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Parliament of England may bind Ireland; it muſt alſo be allowed, that the people of Ireland ought to have their Repreſentatives in the Parliament of England.

                     <p>This ſending of Repreſentatives out of Ireland to the Parliament in England, on ſome occaſions, was found in proceſs of time to be very troubleſome and inconvenient; and this we may preſume was the reaſon that, afterwards, when times were more ſettled, we fell again into our old track and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar courſe of Parliaments in our own country; and hereupon the laws afore-noted, page 64, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, eſtabliſhing, that <hi>no law made in the Parliament of England ſhould be of force in Ireland, till it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and publiſhed in Parliament here.</hi>

                        </q> But this averſion of <hi>"ſome of the Iriſh"</hi> to the Engliſh Laws is eaſily accounted for, ſince it appears very clearly, from Sir John Davies's Book, that the Iriſhry had much more experience and woful knowledge of <hi>Engliſh Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> than of the <hi>Engliſh Laws;</hi> for, when any of them wore driven from their Lands and Poſſeſſions through the avarice, and by the unlawful power, of the great Engliſh Lords, who found their intereſt in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as enemies, it was very <hi>natural</hi> for them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to <hi>diſſeize,</hi> and recover their former Rights and Poſſeſſions: and again, when they found no Protection from the Engliſh Laws, nor other exertion thereof than that of <hi>ſining</hi> and <hi>puniſhing</hi> them for ſuch <hi>"Diſſeizins," &amp;c.</hi> which were mere <hi>Re-entries,</hi> it was <hi>equally natural</hi> for them to imbibe prejudices againſt the Engliſh Laws, and to fly to their Bogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the <hi>Engliſh Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> were apparently the cauſe why <hi>ſome</hi> of the Iriſh were averſe to the <hi>Engliſh Laws;</hi> which I have expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more at large in a Note on p. 108.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1198200100:141"/>are alſo obliged to Serjeant Mayart for ſome other Proofs in their favour, <hi>which he intended againſt them:</hi> for, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Precedents of <hi>giving Law,</hi> he informs us, in p. 219. <q>that, in the Reign of King Henry II. <hi>the common Law</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> Cuſtoms of <hi>England</hi> were received, planted, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in this his Majeſty's Kingdom of Ireland;</q> a Point which every Iriſh Patriot is zealous to maintain! And he has favoured us, in page 220, with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other notable Example of binding the <hi>Iriſh</hi> by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws: this, it ſeems, was in the Reign of King John, <q>of whom,</q> (ſays he triumphantly,) <q>in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1198200100:142"/>that reſpect, it may be well ſaid, that, <hi>Statuit et praecepit Leges;</hi> he <hi>appointed and eſtabliſhed the Laws;</hi> as alſo becauſe he put them in writing, and left them in his Court of Exchequer for their better directions:</q> but he happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us at the ſame time, (which ſpoils his own application of the Precedent,) that all this was done <hi>"at the inſtance"</hi> (ſays he) <q>
                     <hi>of the Iriſh,</hi> (as the Record ſaith,) or of the Engliſh who account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves Iriſh,</q> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as theſe Engliſh Laws and Cuſtoms are clearly acknowledged by himſelf to have been introduced <q>
                     <hi>at the inſtance of the Iriſh,</hi>
                  </q> it muſt manifeſtly appear, that this antient example excludes the Doctrine which he meant to ſupport by it, in oppoſition to Sir Richard Bolton; and therefore, if all theſe points are duly conſidered, I think we may very fairly retort his own words (which he exulting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to Sir Richard Bolton) upon

                           <hi>It has ever been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the Kingdom of Ireland is inſeparably annexed to the Imperial Crown of England</hi> The obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that our Legiſlature lies under by Poining's
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1198200100:144"/>Act, 10 Hen. VII. c. 4, makes this <hi>Tye between the two Kingdoms</hi> indiſſoluble. And we muſt ever own it our happineſs to be thus annexed to England; and that the Kings and Queens of England are, by undoubted Right, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> Kings and Queens of Ireland. And from hence we may reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that, if any Acts of Parliament made in England ſhould be of force in Ireland, before they are received there in Parliament, they ſhould be more eſpecially ſuch Acts as relate to the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> and <hi>Settlement of the Crown,</hi> and <hi>Recognition</hi> of the King's Title thereto, and the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> of the King. And yet we find, in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Statutes, 28 Hen.

So likewiſe we find, amongſt the Iriſh Statutes, <hi>Acts of Recognition of the King's Title to Ireland,</hi> in the reigns of Henry VIII. Queen Elizabeth, King James, King Charles II. King William and Queen Mary. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Ireland, though annexed to the Crown of England, has always been looked upon to be a <hi>kingdom complete within itſelf,</hi> and to have all Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to an abſolute Kingdom belonging, and ſubordinate to no legiſlative authority on Earth: Though, it is to be noted, theſe Engliſh Acts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1198200100:145"/>to the ſucceſſion, and recognition of the King's Title, do particularly name Ireland.</q>

                           <hi>according to their own deſire, was joyfully accepted and obeyed,</hi> and of many the ſame was ſoon after abſolutely refuſed, preferring their <hi>Brehen</hi> Law before the juſt and honourable Lawes of England. <bibl>1ſt Inſt. p. 141.</bibl>

                     <p>But this ſubſequent refuſal, and preference given to the <hi>Brehen Law,</hi> muſt not be charged to the <hi>native Iriſh</hi> in general; for Sir John Davis, in his <q>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie of the true cauſes why Ireland was never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſubdued,</q> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> demonſtrates that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Settlers</hi> were <hi>principally</hi> to be blamed for this.

                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In p. 262, he informs us, that Sir Edmund Pelham and himſelf were <q>

               <p>If it had been poſſible for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Subjects to have given up to Serjeant Mayart this conteſted point, concerning the neceſſity of <hi>a due Repreſentation in the Legiſlature,</hi> without giving up, at the ſame time, <hi>all due Limitation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and conſequently <hi>all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to their natural Freedom,</hi> this advice of his might have been eſteemed excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable!</p>
               <p>But it is <hi>Repreſentation alone</hi> which forms the Baſis, the ſuperiority, and the eſſential difference, of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of State, from all others!

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1198200100:156"/>Emperor, of a Triumvirate, or of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Nobles or proud Patricians, (as among the Romans, at different periods of time). The adminiſtration of each of theſe orders of power, reſpectively, is almoſt equally arbitrary, uncertain, and dangerous to the community; to which the Hiſtories of all monarchical as well as ariſtocratical Governments (I mean thoſe that are merely or too nearly ſuch) bear ſufficient teſtimony: ſo that <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the people</hi> is the grand point of diſtinction, the fundamental principle, whereby the equity and ſafety of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government is to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, when we compare it with ſuch Governments as either that of France, or that of Poland.</p>
               <p>I have already given ſome ſpecimens of <hi>French</hi> Government and <hi>French</hi> Law in my Preface, it being neceſſary that <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects ſhould be well aware of

However, the learned Commentator himſelf very juſtly obſerves, in a preceding page, (150,) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning "the manner and time of aſſembling" that the <q>Parliament is regularly to be ſummoned by the King's <hi>Writ</hi> or Letter, iſſued out of Chancery.</q> And it is well known that theſe Writs are not addreſſed to the knights, citizens, and burgeſſes, elected for any <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Parliament, but to <hi>the Sheriffs alone,</hi> to cauſe <hi>Kinghts, Citizens, &amp;c. to be elected;</hi> for, when the ſaid Acts were made, ſuch an abſurdity in politics had never been conceived in England, as that of entruſting the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation</hi> of the people, for <hi>a term of years,</hi> (as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,) to the perſons elected! On the contrary, when the buſineſs of each Seſſions was finiſhed, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of courſe, was at an end; and therefore Lord Coke did not ſpeak in vain, when he mentioned <hi>"the 
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1198200100:201"/>excellent Law"</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Act for <hi>annual</hi> Parliaments) <hi>"being applied to the ſaid Writs of Parliament,"</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited.</p>
                     <p>A man of ſo much good-ſenſe, learning, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Sir William Blackſtone is maſter of, muſt be well aware of the pernicious effects of inveſting the Repreſentatives of the people with a legiſlative power, beyond the conſtitutional term of A SINGLE SESSION, without <hi>Re-election;</hi> and therefore I cannot but be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the unguarded manner in which he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf in his Comment on the two <hi>excellent Statutes</hi> of Edward III. for <hi>annual</hi> Parliaments; <hi>viz.</hi> that the King is not,<q>or ever was, obliged by theſe Statutes to call a <hi>new</hi> Parliament every year,</q> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He has cauſed the word <hi>new</hi> to be printed in <hi>Italies,</hi> as if he meant thereby to inſinuate, that the Legiſlatures of thoſe early times were not unacquainted with our modern idea of conferring on the popular Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives a kind of <hi>continued ſenatorial dignity,</hi> without <hi>Re-election,</hi> for ſeveral years together; whereas he certainly muſt have known that this corrupt <hi>modorn</hi> practice has produced a <hi>new order</hi> of men amongſt us a moſt dangerous increaſe of ariſtocratical power, which was entirely unknown to our Anceſtors in the glorious reign of Edward III. If he could ſhew that there <hi>ever</hi> was a Parliament, in thoſe times, that was <hi>not a</hi> NEW <hi>Parliament,</hi> his Comment might be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied! But it is notorious that Writs were iſſued to the Sheriffs, for <hi>new</hi> Elections, almoſt <hi>every year</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that whole reign: The Writs, for the moſt part, 
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1198200100:202"/>are ſtill preſerved with the Returns upon them. In the catalogue of Election-Writs, which Prynn has given in his <hi>Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,</hi> p. 4 to 6, there is an account of Writs iſſued for <hi>new</hi> Elections in every year of that King's reign, between his 34th (when the laſt Act for annual Parliaments was made) and his 50th year, except 3, <hi>viz.</hi> the 40th, 41ſt, and 48th years; in which years the Records of Summons to the Prelates and Lords of Parliament are alſo want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as appears by Sir William Dugdale's <q>perfect Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of Summons to Parliament, of the Nobility,</q> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet this affords no abſolute proof that Parliaments were not held <hi>in thoſe very years</hi> for which the Writs are wanting; becauſe the bundles of Writs for the ſaid years may have been loſt or miſlaid. The only wonder is, that more have not been abſolutely loſt, when we conſider the very little care that had been taken of them; for Prynne found many of theſe Writs diſperſed amongſt a vaſt miſcellaneous heap of other records on various ſubjects, (as he himſelf relates in his Epiſtle-Dedicatory to King Charles II. of his <hi>Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,</hi>) calling the ſaid heap a <q>
                           <hi>confuſed Chaos,</hi> under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding, putrifying cobwebs, duſt, and filth, in the darkeſt corner of Caeſar's Chapel in the White Tower, as <hi>mere uſeleſs Reliques not worthy to be calendred,</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, in page 103 of that ſame work, he ſpeaks of 117 Bundles of Writs, whereof 97 had only been then <hi>lately</hi> diſcovered, filed, and bundled, by himſelf: "But many of theſe 117 Bundles" (ſays he) <q>are

                     </p>
                     <p>But that there were really Writs for Parliaments, even in thoſe <hi>three</hi> years, which appear to be wanting, at leaſt in <hi>two</hi> of them, is very certain; becauſe it was in the 40th year of this reign, as Sir Edward Coke informs us, (4 Inſt. p. 13,) that the Pope demanded homage for the kingdoms of England and Ireland, and the arrears of revenue granted by King John to Pope Innocent III. <q>whereupon the King, in the <hi>ſame year, calleth his Court of Parliament,</hi>

               <p>I have dwelt much longer upon theſe <hi>three Precedents</hi> (cited by the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mr. Barrington) <hi>againſt Ireland,</hi> than I at firſt intended; but the ſeveral diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſubjects, to which I was naturally
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1198200100:212"/>led in the examination of them, are of ſo much conſtitutional importance, and ſo neceſſary to be known to every Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that I hope I may be excuſed for having, as they occurred, enlarged upon them, in the ſeveral Notes which I have added to my Text.</p>
               <p>And, with reſpect to the <hi>three Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> themſelves, I flatter myſelf that every impartial Reader, who carefully conſiders what has been already ſaid upon them, will freely pronounce them <hi>illegal,</hi> and totally unworthy of being allowed the leaſt weight or conſideration, as <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents,</hi> againſt the <hi>Independence</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſince they are equally capable of being retorted <hi>as Precedents</hi> for enſlaving even <hi>England itſelf:</hi> but I muſt therefore repeat what I have before declared, in p. 141 and elſewhere, that I am very ſure the worthy Writer, who unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly cited them, will be as zealous to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1198200100:213"/>oppoſe any ſuch doctrine as myſelf; and I believe that I may farther aſſure myſelf, that this learned Author will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed or offended with the freedom of theſe remarks upon his Work; for, though I have not the honour to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally acquainted with him, yet I am ſufficiently acquainted (by other parts of his Writings) with the general benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and rectitude of his intentions, and alſo that he is an admirer and faſt friend to our <hi>conſtitutional Liberty</hi> (which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears in many other parts of his uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Work) as well as myſelf; ſo that any corrections, <hi>on that ſide of the queſtion,</hi> will be taken (I dare ſay) by him as they were meant by me, that is, in good part, and without the leaſt ill will: and his Work (I ſpeak of it in general) has very deſervedly acquired ſo much eſteem and credit in the world, that I could not, without great injuſtice to the ſubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, permit any arguments therein,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1198200100:214"/>upon the point in queſtion, to remain unanſwered.</p>
               <p>The ſame obſervation, I am inclined to think, is equally applicable, as well to the candour and diſpoſition, as to the writings, of Sir William Blackſtone, whoſe very learned and uſeful Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries muſt alſo be ſtrictly examined, upon this point, before I conclude my Declaration: and, had the other great and eminent writers (Lord Coke, Lord Chief Juſtice Vaughan, Judge Jenkins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) whoſe opinions, upon the preſent ſubject, I am obliged alſo to call in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, been ſtill alive, I ſhould have thought myſelf equally ſure of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and forgiveneſs, if I except Serjeant Mayart; becauſe the undeſerved contempt, with which he has treated Sir Richard Bolton, (the learned Author whom he attempted to anſwer,) prevents
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1198200100:215"/>my entertaining ſo charitable and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an opinion of him as I do of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Though I have now drawn theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks concerning the Conſtitution of <hi>Ireland</hi> to a much greater length than I at firſt propoſed, yet I muſt not conclude whilſt any material aſſertions of great authority remain unanſwered. Several of Sir Edward Coke's objections, on this head, have already, towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this 2d part, been proved (I hope) to want <hi>foundation:</hi> but there ſtill remains to be conſidered a further doctrine, on the ſame point, advanced by him in <hi>Calvin's Caſe,</hi> which, I truſt, will appear to be <hi>equally unjuſt,</hi> though <hi>founded</hi> on the opinion of <q>
                     <hi>all the Judges in England!</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"In Anno 33 Reg. El." (ſays he) <q>it was reſolved, by <hi>all the Judges in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> in the caſe of Orurke, <hi>an Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But this doctrine, notwithſtanding the great authority with which it is here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, is obnoxious to a <hi>fundamental Right of the Subject,</hi> the <q>
                     <hi>Trial by a Jury of the</hi> VICINAGE,</q> or of <q>
                     <hi>Neighbours to the Fact,</hi>
                  </q> which is due to every private perſon in the Britiſh Dominions, according to the ancient Laws and Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of this realm; otherwiſe the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would ceaſe to be <hi>limited,</hi> and thereby would ceaſe to be <hi>lawful!</hi> So that if Sir Edward Coke had been as much upon his guard, when he quoted this (<hi>"Reſolution of all the Judges,"</hi> as he was when he made his Remarks on that wicked Act of Parliament, in the reign
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1198200100:217"/>of K. Hen. VII. by which alſo the <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Right of Trial by Juries</hi> was violated, he would neither have mentioned that Reſolution of "all the Judges," or even the Act itſelf, without guarding againſt the pernicious effects of ſuch an unconſtitutional doctrine, by a proper cenſure, as he did in the former caſe.</p>
               <p>"It is not almoſt credible to foreſee" (ſays he) <q>when any when any <hi>maxim</hi> or <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law</hi> of this realm <hi>is altered,</hi> (as elſewhere hath been obſerved,) what <hi>dangerous inconveniences</hi> do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; which moſt expreſely appeareth by this <hi>moſt unjuſt and ſtrange</hi> Act of 11 Hen.

                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:1198200100:218"/>(be they never ſo obſolete or unfit for the time,) <q>by <hi>information only,</hi> without any preſentment or <hi>Trial by Jury,</hi> being the antient <hi>Birthright of the Subject,</hi> but to hear and determine the ſame <hi>by their diſcretion,</hi> inflicting ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty as <hi>the Statutes not repealed impoſed,</hi> &amp;c. <bibl>4th Inſt. c. 1. p. 41.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And afterwards he adds: <q>This Statute of 11 H. VII. we have recited, and ſhewed <hi>the juſt inconvenience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> to the end, <hi>that the like</hi> ſhould never hereafter be attempted <hi>in any Court of Parliament.</hi> And that others might avoid THE FEARFUL END OF THESE TWO TIME-SERVERS, <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley.</hi> Qui eorum veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigia inſiſtunt, eorum exitus perhorreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. <bibl>(ibid.)</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But, though theſe two wretched Judges were <hi>hanged</hi> for their <hi>time-ſerving,</hi> yet
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1198200100:219"/>it appears, by this account of Lord Coke, that, when they preſumed to diſpenſe with the interpoſition of <hi>Juries,</hi> they acted by the <hi>expreſs Authority</hi> of a <hi>Statute,</hi> or <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> and, though they were <hi>Time-ſervers,</hi> ſo far as to acquieſce (contrary <hi>to their Duty, as Judges</hi>) in enforcing that wicked and unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Statute, (which exceeded the due bounds to which the Engliſh Legiſlature is neceſſarily <hi>limited,</hi>) yet, it ſeems, they <hi>adjudged no penalties,</hi> in conſequence thereof, but ſuch as <q>
                     <hi>the Statutes, not repealed, impoſed.</hi>
                  </q> And it is plain, therefore, that the crime of thoſe two Judges (againſt which Lord Coke men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <q>the FEARFUL END <hi>of thoſe two time-ſervers,</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>as a warning to all future</hi> JUDGES) conſiſted in allowing <hi>the force of Law</hi> to a wicked unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> by which <q>
                     <hi>a</hi> FUNDAMENTAL LAW <hi>of this realm</hi>
                  </q> (was) <hi>"altered;"</hi> ſo that their <hi>crime</hi> was
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1198200100:220"/>exactly parallel to the (equally <hi>criminal</hi>) reſolution of <hi>"all the Judges in England,"</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Orurke</hi> the <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned, (which was, in like manner, founded on an expreſs Act of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> 33 Hen. VIII. c. 23.) and parallel alſo to the crime (for it muſt be ſo eſteemed) of <q>
                     <hi>all the Judges of England,</hi>
                  </q> when they "reſolved," in <hi>Sir John Perrot's Caſe,</hi> that, <q>
                     <hi>for a Treaſon done in</hi> IRELAND, <hi>the offender may be tried, by the Statute</hi> 35 Hen. VIII.

                  </q> &amp;c. <bibl>3d Inſt. p. 11.</bibl> But the Judges, in both theſe caſes, were quite as <hi>inexcuſable</hi> as the two <hi>time-ſervers,</hi> Dudley and Empſon; for, if the real <hi>Intention</hi> of the Legiſlature, by the ſaid Acts of 33 and 35 Hen.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1198200100:254"/>popiſh maſſacre in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when the Proteſtant Subjects of that kingdom were almoſt univerſally oppreſſed, and all Law and Regularity overturned by the open Rebellion of the popiſh party: ſo that even the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> (as well as the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>) thought it right to take the affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi> under their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration at that unfortunate juncture; and ſent two Commiſſioners, properly inſtructed by the States of that kingdom, to treat with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament about the means of ſuppreſſing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion. Sir John Temple's Hiſtory of the Iriſh Rebellions p. 156 to 158.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding that ſome Acts might have been made in the 17th of Charles I. without the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament, yet they afford no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in favour of that opinion for which they are cited by the learned Judge; for Mr. Molyneux has proved that, by the repeal of thoſe very Acts of 17 Cha.

                           <hi>that the Parliament of</hi> IRELAND <hi>may repeal an Act made in</hi> ENGLAND <hi>in relation to the affairs of</hi> IRELAND, <bibl>p. 75.</bibl>
