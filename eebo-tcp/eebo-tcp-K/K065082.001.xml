            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is not my intention to detain the reader by expatiating on the variety, or the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſubject, which I have undertaken to treat; ſince the merit of the choice would ſerve to render the weakneſs of the execution ſtill more apparent, and ſtill leſs excuſable. But as I have preſumed to lay before the Public a <hi>firſt</hi> volume only <note n="1" place="bottom">The firſt volume of the quarto, is now contained in the two firſt volumes of this octavo, edition.</note> of the Hiſtory of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and Fall of the Roman Empire, it will perhaps be expected that I ſhould explain, in a few words, the nature and limits of my general plan.</p>
            <p>The memorable ſeries of revolutions, which, in the courſe of about thirteen centuries, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually undermined, and at length deſtroyed, the ſolid fabric of Roman greatneſs, may, with ſome propriety, be divided into the three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing periods.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0034700101:4"/>
1. The firſt of theſe periods may be traced from the age of Trajan and the Antonines, when the Roman monarchy, having attained its full ſtrength and maturity, began to verge towards its decline; and will extend to the ſubverſion of the Weſtern Empire, by the barbarians of Germany and Scythia, the rude anceſtors of the moſt poliſhed nations of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Europe. This extraordinary revolution, which ſubjected Rome to the power of a Gothic conqueror, was completed about the beginning of the ſixth century.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſecond period of the Decline and Fall of Rome, may be ſuppoſed to commence with the reign of Juſtinian, who by his laws, as well as by his victories, reſtored a tranſient ſplendour to the Eaſtern Empire. It will comprehend the invaſion of Italy by the Lombards; the conqueſt of the Aſiatic and African provinces by the Arabs, who embraced the religion of Mahomet; the revolt of the Roman people againſt the feeble princes of Conſtantinople; and the elevation of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne, who, in the year eight hundred, eſtabliſhed the ſecond, or German Empire of the weſt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The laſt and longeſt of theſe periods includes about ſix centuries and a half; from
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0034700101:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the revival of the Weſtern Empire, till the taking of Conſtantinople by the Turks, and the extinction of a degenerate race of princes, who continued to aſſume the titles of Caeſar and Auguſtus, after their dominions were contracted to the limits of a ſingle city; in which the language, as well as manners, of the ancient Romans, had been long ſince for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. The writer who ſhould undertake to relate the events of this period, would find himſelf obliged to enter into the general hiſtory of the Cruſades, as far as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the ruin of the Greek Empire; and he would ſcarcely be able to reſtrain his curioſity from making ſome inquiry into the ſtate of the city of Rome, during the darkneſs and confuſion of the middle ages.</p>
            <div type="postscript">
               <p>As I have ventured, perhaps too haſtily, to commit to the preſs, a work, which, in every ſenſe of the word, deſerves the epithet of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, I conſider myſelf as contracting an engagement to finiſh, moſt probably in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond volume <note n="2" place="bottom">The Author, as it frequently happens, took an inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate meaſure of his growing work. The remainder of the firſt period has filled <hi>two</hi> volumes in quarto, the <hi>four</hi> laſt volumes of this octavo edition.</note>, the firſt of theſe memorable periods; and to deliver to the Public, the complete hiſtory of the Decline and Fall of
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0034700101:6"/>
Rome, from the age of the Antonines, to the ſubverſion of the Weſtern Empire. With regard to the ſubſequent periods, though I may entertain ſome hopes, I dare not preſume to give any aſſurances. The execution of the extenſive plan which I have deſcribed, would connect the ancient and modern hiſtory of the World; but it would require many years of health, of leiſure, and of perſeverance.</p>

and I have now embraced the ſerious reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proceeding to the laſt period of my original deſign, and of the Roman Empire, the taking of Conſtantinople by the Turks, in the year one thouſand four hundred and fifty-three. The moſt patient Reader, who computes that three ponderous volumes <note n="3" place="bottom">The ſix volumes of this octavo edition.</note> have been already employed on the events of four centuries, may, perhaps, be alarmed at the long proſpect of nine hundred years. But it is not my intention to expatiate with the ſame minuteneſs on the whole ſeries of the Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine hiſtory. At our entrance into this period, the reign of Juſtinian, and the conqueſts of the Mahometans, will deſerve and detain our attention, and the laſt age of Conſtantinople (the Cruſades and the Turks) is connected with the revolutions of Modern Europe. From the ſeventh to the eleventh century, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure interval will be ſupplied by a conciſe narrative of ſuch facts, as may ſtill appear either intereſting or important.</p>

The Hiſtory of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is now delivered to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic in a more convenient form. Some altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and improvements had preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to my mind, but I was unwilling to injure or offend the purchaſers of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing editions. The accuracy of the Corrector of the preſs has been already tried and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: and, perhaps, I may ſtand excuſed, if, amidſt the avocations of a buſy winter, I have preferred the pleaſures of compoſition and ſtudy, to the minute diligence of reviſing a former publication.</p>

            <p>DILIGENCE and accuracy are the only merits which an hiſtorical writer may aſcribe to himſelf; if any merit indeed can be aſſumed from the performance of an indiſpenſable duty. I may therefore be allowed to ſay, that I have carefully examined all the original materials that could illuſtrate the ſubject which I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to treat. Should I ever complete the extenſive deſign which has been ſketched out in the Preface, I might perhaps conclude it with a critical account of the authors conſulted during the progreſs of the whole work; and however ſuch an attempt might incur the cenſure of oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I am perſuaded, that it would be ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of entertainment as well as information.</p>
            <p>At preſent I ſhall content myſelf with a ſingle obſervation. The Biographers, who, under the reigns of Diocletian and Conſtantine, compoſed, or rather compiled, the lives of the Emperors, from Hadrian to the ſons of Carus, are uſually mentioned under the names of Aelius Spartianus, Julius Capitolinus, Aelius Lampridius, Vulcatius Gallicanus, Trebellius Pollio, and Flavius Vopiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus. But there is ſo much perplexity in the titles
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0034700101:10"/>
of the MSS.; and ſo many diſputes have ariſen among the critics (ſee Fabricius, Biblioth. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. l. iii. c. 6.) concerning their number, their names, and their reſpective property, that for the moſt part I have quoted them without diſtinction, under the general and well-known title of the <hi>Auguſtan Hiſtory.</hi>

            <p>IN the ſecond century of the Chriſtian Aera, the empire of Rome comprehended the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the earth, and the moſt civilized <note place="margin">Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> portion of mankind. The frontiers of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive monarchy were guarded by ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown and diſciplined valour. The gentle, but powerful influence of laws and manners had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abuſed the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free conſtitution was preſerved with decent reverence: The Roman ſenate appeared to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the ſovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. During a happy period of more than <note place="margin">A. D. 98,—180.</note>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0034700101:26"/>
fourſcore years, the public adminiſtration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines. It is the deſign of this, and of the two ſucceeding chapters, to deſcribe the proſperous condition of their empire; and afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant circumſtances of its decline and fall; a revolution which will ever be remembered, and is ſtill felt by the nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>The principal conqueſts of the Romans were <note place="margin">Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Auguſtus.</note> atchieved under the republic; and the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, for the moſt part, were ſatisfied with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving thoſe dominions which had been acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the policy of the ſenate, the active emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conſuls, and the martial enthuſiaſm of the people. The ſeven firſt centuries were filled with a rapid ſucceſſion of triumphs; but it was reſerved for Auguſtus, to relinquiſh the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſign of ſubduing the whole earth, and to introduce a ſpirit of moderation into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic councils. Inclined to peace by his temper and ſituation, it was eaſy for him to diſcover, that Rome, in her preſent exalted ſituation, had much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs to hope than to fear from the chance of arms; and that, in the proſecution of remote wars, the undertaking became every day more difficult, the event more doubtful, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion more precarious, and leſs beneficial. The experience of Auguſtus added weight to theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary reflections, and effectually convinced him, that, by the prudent vigour of his counſels, it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0034700101:27"/>
would be eaſy to ſecure every conceſſion, which the ſafety or the dignity of Rome might require from the moſt formidable Barbarians. Inſtead of expoſing his perſon and his legions to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the Parthians, he obtained, by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable treaty, the reſtitution of the ſtandards and priſoners which had been taken in the defeat of Craſſus <note n="1" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius (l. liv. p. 736.), with the annotations of Reymar, who has collected all that Roman vanity has left upon the ſubject. The marble of Ancyra, on which Auguſtus recorded his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, aſſerts that <hi>he compelled</hi> the Parthians to reſtore the enſigns of Craſſus.</note>.</p>
            <p>His generals, in the early part of his reign, attempted the reduction of Aethiopia and Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia Felix. They marched near a thouſand miles to the ſouth of the tropic; but the heat of the climate ſoon repelled the invaders, and protected the unwarlike natives of thoſe ſequeſtered regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note n="2" place="bottom">Strabo (l. xvi. p. 780.), Pliny the elder (Hiſt. Natur. l. vi. c. 32. 35.), and Dion. Caſſius (l. liii. p. 723. and l. liv. p. 734.), have left us very curious details concerning theſe wars. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans made themſelves maſters of Mariaba, or Merab, a city of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia Felix, well known to the Orientals (ſee Abulfeda and the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian geography, p. 52.). They were arrived within three days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the Spice country, the rich object of their invaſion.</note>. The northern countries of Europe ſcarcely deſerved the expence and labour of conqueſt. The foreſts and moraſſes of Germany were filled with a hardy race of barbarians, who deſpiſed life when it was ſeparated from freedom; and though, on the firſt attack, they ſeemed to yield to the weight of the Roman power, they ſoon, by a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal act of deſpair, regained their independence, and reminded Auguſtus of the viciſſitude of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune <note n="3" place="bottom">By the ſlaughter of Varus and his three legions. See the firſt book of the Annals of Tacitus. Sueton. in Auguſt. c. 23. and Velleius Paterculus, l. ii. c. 117, &amp;c. Auguſtus did not receive the melancholy news with all the temper and firmneſs that might have been expected from his character.</note>.

On the death of that emperor, his teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was publicly read in the ſenate. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed, as a valuable legacy to his ſucceſſors, the advice of confining the empire within thoſe limits, which Nature ſeemed to have placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries; on the weſt the Atlantic ocean; the Rhine and Danube on the north; the Euphrates on the eaſt; and towards the ſouth, the ſandy deſarts of Arabia and Africa <note n="4" place="bottom">Tacit.

            <p>Happily for the repoſe of mankind, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <note place="margin">Imitated by his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</note> ſyſtem recommended by the wiſdom of Auguſtus, was adopted by the fears and vices of his immediate ſucceſſors. Engaged in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of pleaſure, or in the exerciſe of tyranny, the firſt Caeſars ſeldom ſhewed themſelves to the armies, or to the provinces; nor were they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſuffer, that thoſe triumphs which <hi>their</hi> indolence neglected, ſhould be uſurped by the conduct and valour of their lieutenants. The military fame of a ſubject was conſidered as an inſolent invaſion of the Imperial prerogative; and it became the duty, as well as intereſt, of every Roman general, to guard the frontiers intruſted to his care, without aſpiring to conqueſts which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0034700101:29"/>
might have proved no leſs fatal to himſelf than to the vanquiſhed barbarians <note n="5" place="bottom">Germanicus, Suetonius Paulinus, and Agricola, were checked and recalled in the courſe of their victories. Corbulo was put to death. Military merit, as it is admirably expreſſed by Tacitus, was, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word, <hi>imperatoria virtus.</hi>

            <p>The only acceſſion which the Roman empire <note place="margin">Conqueſt of Britain was the firſt excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it.</note> received, during the firſt century of the Chriſtian Aera, was the province of Britain. In this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſtance the ſucceſſors of Caeſar and Auguſtus were perſuaded to follow the example of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, rather than the precept of the latter. The proximity of its ſituation to the coaſt of Gaul ſeemed to invite their arms; the pleaſing, though doubtful intelligence of a pearl fiſhery, attracted their avarice <note n="6" place="bottom">Caeſar himſelf conceals that ignoble motive; but it is mentioned by Suetonius, c 47. The Britiſh pearls proved, however, of little value, on account of their dark and livid colour. Tacitus obſerves, with reaſon (in Agricola, c. 12.), that it was an inherent defect. <q>Ego facilius crediderim, naturam margaritis deeſſe quam nobis avaritiam.</q>
               </note>; and as Britain was viewed in the light of a diſtinct and inſulated world, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſcarcely formed any exception to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſyſtem of continental meaſures After a war of about forty years, undertaken by the moſt ſtupid <note n="7" place="bottom">Claudius, Nero, and Domitian. A hope is expreſſed by Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius Mela, l. iii. c. 6. (he wrote under Claudius) that, by the ſucceſs of the Roman arms, the iſland and its ſavage inhabitants would ſoon be better known. It is amuſing enough to peruſe ſuch paſſages in the midſt of London.</note>, maintained by the moſt diſſolute, and terminated by the moſt timid of all the emperors, the far greater part of the iſland ſubmitted to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0034700101:30"/>
the Roman yoke <note n="8" place="bottom">See the admirable abridgment given by Tacitus, in the life of Agricola, and copiouſly, though perhaps not completely, illuſtrated by our own antiquarians, Camden and Horſley.</note>. The various tribes of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons poſſeſſed valour without conduct, and the love of freedom without the ſpirit of union. They took up arms with ſavage fierceneſs; they laid them down, or turned them againſt each other with wild inconſtancy; and while they fought ſingly, they were ſucceſſively ſubdued. Neither the fortitude of Caractacus, nor the deſpair of Boadicea, nor the fanaticiſm of the Druids, could avert the ſlavery of their country, or reſiſt the ſteady progreſs of the Imperial generals, who maintained the national glory, when the throne was diſgraced by the weakeſt, or the moſt vicious of mankind. At the very time when Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, confined to his palace, felt the terrors which he inſpired; his legions, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the virtuous Agricola, defeated the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected force of the Caledonians at the foot of the Grampian hills; and his fleets, venturing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore an unknown and dangerous navigation, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the Roman arms round every part of the iſland. The conqueſt of Britain was conſidered as already atchieved; and it was the deſign of Agricola to complete and enſure his ſucceſs by the eaſy reduction of Ireland, for which, in his opinion, one legion and a few auxiliaries were ſufficient <note n="9" place="bottom">The Iriſh writers, jealous of their national honour, are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked on this occaſion, both with Tacitus and with Agricola.</note>. The weſtern iſle might be improved into a valuable poſſeſſion, and the Britons would
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0034700101:31"/>
wear their chains with the leſs reluctance, if the proſpect and example of freedom was on every ſide removed from before their eyes.</p>
            <p>But the ſuperior merit of Agricola ſoon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned his removal from the government of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and for ever diſappointed this rational, though extenſive ſcheme of conqueſt. Before his departure, the prudent general had provided for ſecurity as well as for dominion. He had obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the iſland is almoſt divided into two unequal parts by the oppoſite gulfs, or, as they are now called, the Friths of Scotland. Acroſs the narrow interval of about forty miles, he had drawn a line of military ſtations, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fortified in the reign of Antoninus Pius, by a turf rampart erected on foundations of ſtone <note n="10" place="bottom">See Horſley's Britannia Romana, l. i. c. 10.</note>. This wall of Antoninus, at a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance beyond the modern cities of Edinburgh and Glaſgow, was fixed as the limit of the Roman province. The native Caledonians preſerved in the northern extremity of the iſland their wild independence, for which they were not leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to their poverty than to their valour. Their incurſions were frequently repelled and chaſtiſed; but their country was never ſubdued <note n="11" place="bottom">The poet Buchanan celebrates, with elegance and ſpirit (ſee his Sylvae v.), the unviolated independence of his native country. But, if the ſingle teſtimony of Richard of Cirenceſter was ſufficient to create a Roman province of Veſpaſiana to the north of the wall, that independence would be reduced within very narrow limits.</note>. The maſters of the faireſt and moſt wealthy cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the globe, turned with contempt from

            <p>Such was the ſtate of the Roman frontiers, and <note place="margin">Conqueſt of Dacia; the ſecond exception.</note> ſuch the maxims of Imperial policy from the death of Auguſtus to the acceſſion of Trajan. That virtuous and active prince had received the education of a ſoldier, and poſſeſſed the talents of a general <note n="13" place="bottom">See Pliny's Panegyric, which ſeems founded on facts.</note>. The peaceful ſyſtem of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors was interrupted by ſcenes of war and conqueſt; and the legions, after a long interval, beheld a military emperor at their head. The firſt exploits of Trajan were againſt the Dacians, the moſt warlike of men, who dwelt beyond the Danube, and who, during the reign of Domitian, had inſulted with impunity the Majeſty of Rome <note n="14" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius, l. lxvii.</note>. To the ſtrength and fierceneſs of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, they added a contempt for life, which was derived from a warm perſuaſion of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and tranſmigration of the ſoul <note n="15" place="bottom">Herodotus, l. iv. c. 94.

memorable war, with a very ſhort ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities, laſted five years; and as the emperor could exert, without controul, the whole force of the ſtate, it was terminated by an abſolute ſubmiſſion of the barbarians <note n="17" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius, l. lxviii. p. 1123. 1131. Julian in Caeſaribus. Eutropius, viii. 2. 6. Aurelius Victor in Epitome.</note>. The new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Dacia, which formed a ſecond exception to the precept of Auguſtus, was about thirteen hundred miles in circumference. Its natural boundaries were the Nieſter, the Teyſs, or Tibiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, the Lower Danube, and the Euxine Sea. The veſtiges of a military road may ſtill be traced from the banks of the Danube to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Bender, a place famous in modern hiſtory, and the actual frontier of the Turkiſh and Ruſſian empires <note n="18" place="bottom">See a Memoir of M. d'Anville, on the Province of Dacia, in the Academie des Inſcriptions, tom. xxviii. p. 444—468.</note>.</p>
            <p>Trajan was ambitious of fame; and as long as <note place="margin">Conqueſts of Trajan in the eaſt,</note> mankind ſhall continue to beſtow more liberal applauſe on their deſtroyers than on their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, the thirſt of military glory will ever be the vice of the moſt exalted characters. The praiſes of Alexander, tranſmitted by a ſucceſſion of poets and hiſtorians, had kindled a dangerous emulation in the mind of Trajan. Like him the Roman emperor undertook an expedition againſt the nations of the eaſt, but he lamented with a ſigh, that his advanced age ſcarcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown of the ſon of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip <note n="19" place="bottom">Trajan's ſentiments are repreſented in a very juſt and lively manner in the Caeſars of Julian.</note>. Yet the ſucceſs of Trajan, however tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0034700101:34"/>
was rapid and ſpecious. The degenerate Parthians, broken by inteſtine diſcord, fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his arms. He deſcended the river Tigris in triumph, from the mountains of Armenia to the Perſian gulph. He enjoyed the honour of being the firſt, as he was the laſt, of the Roman generals, who ever navigated that remote ſea. His fleets ravaged the coaſts of Arabia; and Trajan vainly flattered himſelf that he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching towards the confines of India <note n="20" place="bottom">Eutropius and Sextus Rufus have endeavoured to perpetuate the illuſion. See a very ſenſible diſſertation of M. Freret in the Academie des Inſcriptions, tom. xxi. p. 55.</note>. Every day the aſtoniſhed ſenate received the intelligence of new names and new nations, that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his ſway. They were informed that the kings of Boſphorus, Colchos, Iberia, Albania, Oſrhoene, and even the Parthian monarch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had accepted their diadems from the hands of the emperor; that the independent tribes of the Median and Carduchian hills had implored his protection; and that the rich countries of Armenia, Meſopotamia, and Aſſyria, were reduced into the ſtate of provinces <note n="21" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius, l. lxviii; and the Abbreviators.</note>. But the death of Trajan ſoon clouded the ſplendid proſpect; and it was juſtly to be dreaded, that ſo many diſtant nations would throw off the unaccuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yoke, when they were no longer reſtrained by the powerful hand which had impoſed it.</p>
            <p>It was an ancient tradition, that when the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol <note place="margin">Reſigned by his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian.</note> was founded by one of the Roman kings, the god Terminus (who preſided over bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0034700101:35"/>
and was repreſented according to the faſhion of that age by a large ſtone) alone, among all the inferior deities, refuſed to yield his place to Jupiter himſelf. A favourable inference was drawn from his obſtinacy, which was interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the augurs, as a ſure preſage that the boundaries of the Roman power would never recede <note n="22" place="bottom">Ovid. Faſt. l. ii. ver. 667. See Livy, and Dionyſius of Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnaſſus, under the reign of Tarquin.</note>. During many ages, the prediction, as it is uſual, contributed to its own accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But though Terminus had reſiſted the majeſty of Jupiter, he ſubmitted to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the emperor Hadrian <note n="23" place="bottom">St. Auguſtin is highly delighted with the proof of the weakneſs of Terminus, and the vanity of the Augurs. See De Civitate Dei, iv. 29.</note>. The reſignation of all the eaſtern conqueſts of Trajan was the firſt meaſure of his reign. He reſtored to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians the election of an independent Sovereign, withdrew the Roman garriſons from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Armenia, Meſopotamia, and Aſſyria, and, in compliance with the precept of Auguſtus, once more eſtabliſhed the Euphrates as the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier of the empire <note n="24" place="bottom">See the Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 5. Jerome's Chronicle, and all the Epitomiſers. It is ſomewhat ſurpriſing, that this memorable event ſhould be omitted by Dion, or rather by Xiphilin.</note>. Cenſure, which arraigns the public actions and the private motives of princes, has aſcribed to envy, a conduct, which might be attributed to the prudence and moderation of Hadrian. The various character of that emperor, capable, by turns, of the meaneſt and the moſt generous ſentiments, may afford ſome colour to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0034700101:36"/>
the ſuſpicion. It was, however, ſcarcely in his power to place the ſuperiority of his predeceſſor in a more conſpicuous light, than by thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing himſelf unequal to the taſk of defending the conqueſts of Trajan.</p>
            <p>The martial and ambitious ſpirit of Trajan, <note place="margin">Contraſt of Hadrian and Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> formed a very ſingular contraſt with the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſucceſſor. The reſtleſs activity of Hadrian was not leſs remarkable, when compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the gentle repoſe of Antoninus Pius. The life of the former was almoſt a perpetual journey; and as he poſſeſſed the various talents of the ſoldier, the ſtateſman, and the ſcholar, he gratified his curioſity in the diſcharge of his duty. Careleſs of the difference of ſeaſons and of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, he marched on foot, and bare-headed, over the ſnows of Caledonia, and the ſultry plains of the Upper Egypt; nor was there a province of the empire, which, in the courſe of his reign, was not honoured with the preſence of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch <note n="25" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxix. p. 1158. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 5. 8. If all our hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians were loſt, medals, inſcriptions, and other monuments, would be ſufficient to record the travels of Hadrian.</note>. But the tranquil life of Antoninus Pius was ſpent in the boſom of Italy; and, during the twenty-three years that he directed the public adminiſtration, the longeſt journies of that ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prince extended no farther than from his palace in Rome, to the retirement of his Lanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Villa <note n="26" place="bottom">See the Auguſtan Hiſtory and the Epitomes.</note>.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this difference in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal <note place="margin">Pacific ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of Hadrian and the two Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines.</note> conduct, the general ſyſtem of Auguſtus
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0034700101:37"/>
was equally adopted and uniformly purſued by Hadrian and by the two Antonines. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the deſign of maintaining the dignity of the empire, without attempting to enlarge its limits. By every honourable expedient they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the friendſhip of the barbarians; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to convince mankind, that the Roman power, raiſed above the temptation of conqueſt, was actuated only by the love of order and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. During a long period of forty-three years their virtuous labours were crowned with ſucceſs; and if we except a few ſlight hoſtilities that ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exerciſe the legions of the frontier, the reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius offer the fair proſpect of univerſal peace <note n="27" place="bottom">We muſt, however, remember, that, in the time of Hadrian, a rebellion of the Jews raged with religious fury, though only in a ſingle province: Pauſanias (l. viii. c. 43.) mentions two neceſſary and ſucceſsful wars, conducted by the generals of Pius. 1ſt, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wandering Moors, who were driven into the ſolitudes of Atlas. 2d, Againſt the Brigantes of Britain, who had invaded the Roman province. Both theſe wars (with ſeveral other hoſtilities) are mentioned in the Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 19.</note>. The Roman name was revered among the moſt remote na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth. The fierceſt barbarians fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubmitted their differences to the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the emperor; and we are informed by a cotemporary hiſtorian, that he had ſeen am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors who were refuſed the honour which they came to ſolicit, of being admitted into the rank of ſubjects <note n="28" place="bottom">Appian of Alexandria, in the preface to his Hiſtory of the Roman wars.</note>.</p>
            <p>The terror of the Roman arms added weight <note place="margin">Defenſive wars of Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> and dignity to the moderation of the emperors.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0034700101:38"/>
They preſerved peace by a conſtant preparation for war; and while juſtice regulated their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, they announced to the nations on their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, that they were as little diſpoſed to endure, as to offer an injury. The military ſtrength, which it had been ſufficient for Hadrian and the elder Antoninus to diſplay, was exerted againſt the Parthians and the Germans by the emperor Marcus. The hoſtilities of the barbarians pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the reſentment of that philoſophic mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and, in the proſecution of a juſt defence, Marcus and his generals obtained many ſignal victories, both on the Euphrates, and on the Danube <note n="29" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxi. Hiſt. Auguſt. in Marco. The Parthian vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories gave birth to a crowd of contemptible hiſtorians, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory has been reſcued from oblivion, and expoſed to ridicule, in a very lively piece of criticiſm of Lucian.</note>. The military eſtabliſhment of the Roman empire, which thus aſſured either its tranquillity or ſucceſs, will now become the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and important object of our attention.</p>
            <p>In the purer ages of the commonwealth, the <note place="margin">Military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Roman emperors.</note> uſe of arms was reſerved for thoſe ranks of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens who had a country to love, a property to defend, and ſome ſhare in enacting thoſe laws, which it was their intereſt, as well as duty, to maintain. But in proportion as the public free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was loſt in extent of conqueſt, war was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually improved into an art, and degraded into a trade <note n="30" place="bottom">The pooreſt rank of ſoldiers poſſeſſed above forty pounds ſterling (Dionyſ.

The populace, excluded by the ancient conſtitution, were indiſcriminately admitted by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. See Salluſt. de Bell. Jugurth. c. 91.</note>. The legions themſelves, even at the

time when they were recruited in the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant provinces, were ſuppoſed to conſiſt of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man citizens. That diſtinction was generally conſidered, either as a legal qualification, or as a proper recompence for the ſoldier; but a more ſerious regard was paid to the eſſential merit of age, ſtrength, and military ſtature <note n="31" place="bottom">Caeſar formed his legion Alauda, of Gauls and ſtrangers: but it was during the licence of civil war; and after the victory, he gave them the freedom of the city for their reward.</note>. In all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, a juſt preference was given to the climates of the North over thoſe of the South: the race of men born to the exerciſe of arms, was ſought for in the country rather than in cities; and it was very reaſonably preſumed, that the hardy oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations of ſmiths, carpenters, and huntſmen, would ſupply more vigour and reſolution, than the ſedentary trades which are employed in the ſervice of luxury <note n="32" place="bottom">See Vegetius de Re Militari, l. i. c. 2—7.</note>. After every qualification of property had been laid aſide, the armies of the Roman emperors were ſtill commanded, for the moſt part, by officers of a liberal birth and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but the common ſoldiers, like the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary troops of modern Europe, were drawn from the meaneſt, and very frequently from the moſt profligate, of mankind.</p>
            <p>That public virtue which among the ancients <note place="margin">Diſcipline.</note> was denominated patriotiſm, is derived from a ſtrong ſenſe of our own intereſt in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and proſperity of the free government of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0034700101:40"/>
which we are members. Such a ſentiment, which had rendered the legions of the republic almoſt invincible, could make but a very feeble impreſſion on the mercenary ſervants of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotic prince; and it became neceſſary to ſupply that defect by other motives, of a different, but not leſs forcible nature; honour and religion. The peaſant, or mechanic, imbibed the uſeful prejudice that he was advanced to the more dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified profeſſion of arms, in which his rank and reputation would depend on his own valour: and that, although the proweſs of a private ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier muſt often eſcape the notice of fame, his own behaviour might ſometimes confer glory or diſgrace on the company, the legion, or even the army, to whoſe honours he was aſſociated. On his firſt entrance into the ſervice, an oath was adminiſtered to him, with every circumſtance of ſolemnity. He promiſed never to deſert his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, to ſubmit his own will to the commands of his leaders, and to ſacrifice his life for the ſafety of the emperor and the empire <note n="33" place="bottom">The oath of ſervice and fidelity to the emperor, was annually renewed by the troops, on the firſt of January.</note>. The attachment of the Roman troops to their ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, was inſpired by the united influence of religion and of honour. The golden eagle, which glittered in the front of the legion, was the object of their fondeſt devotion; nor was it eſteemed leſs impious, than it was ignominious, to abandon that ſacred enſign in the hour of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <note n="34" place="bottom">Tacitus calls the Roman Eagles, Bellorum Deos. They were placed in a chapel in the camp, and with the other deities received the religious worſhip of the troops.</note>. Theſe motives, which derived their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0034700101:41"/>
ſtrength from the imagination, were enforced by fears and hopes of a more ſubſtantial kind. Regular pay, occaſional donatives, and a ſtated recompence, after the appointed time of ſervice, alleviated the hardſhips of the military life <note n="35" place="bottom">See Gronovius de Pecunia vetere, l. iii. p. 120, &amp;c. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Domitian raiſed the annual ſtipend of the legionaries to twelve pieces of gold, which, in his time, was equivalent to about ten of our guineas. This pay, ſomewhat higher than our own, had been, and was afterwards, gradually increaſed, according to the progreſs of wealth and military government. After twenty years ſervice, the veteran received three thouſand denarii (about one hundred pounds ſterling), or a proportionable allowance of land. The pay and advantages of the guards were, in general, about double thoſe of the legions.</note>, whilſt, on the other hand, it was impoſſible for cowardice or diſobedience to eſcape the ſevereſt puniſhment. The centurions were authorized to chaſtiſe with blows, the generals had a right to puniſh with death; and it was an inflexible maxim of Roman diſcipline, that a good ſoldier ſhould dread his officers far more than the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. From ſuch laudable arts did the valour of the Imperial troops receive a degree of firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and docility, unattainable by the impetuous and irregular paſſions of barbarians.</p>
            <p>And yet ſo ſenſible were the Romans of the <note place="margin">Exerciſes.</note> imperfection of valour without ſkill and practice, that, in their language, the name of an army was borrowed from the word which ſignified ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe <note n="36" place="bottom">

The firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, which always claimed the poſt of honour and the cuſtody of the eagle, was formed of eleven hundred and five ſoldiers, the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for valour and fidelity. The remaining nine cohorts conſiſted each of five hundred and fifty-five; and the whole body of legionary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry amounted to ſix thouſand one hundred men. Their arms were uniform, and admirably <note place="margin">Arms.</note> adapted to the nature of their ſervice: an open helmet, with a lofty creſt; a breaſt-plate, or coat of mail; greaves on their legs, and an ample buckler on their left arm. The buckler was of an oblong and concave figure, four feet in length, and two and an half in breadth, framed of a light wood, covered with a bull's hide, and ſtrongly guarded with plates of braſs. Beſides a lighter ſpear, the legionary ſoldier graſped in his right hand the formidable <hi>pilum,</hi> a ponderous javelin, whoſe utmoſt length was about ſix feet, and which was terminated by a maſſy triangular point of ſteel of eighteen inches <note n="44" place="bottom">In the time of Polybius and Dionyſius of Halicarnaſſus (l. v. c. 45.), the ſteel point of the <hi>pilum</hi> ſeems to have been much longer. In the time of Vegetius, it was reduced to a foot, or even nine inches. I have choſen a medium.</note>. This inſtrument was indeed much inferior to our modern fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms;

As ſoon as the Roman had darted his <hi>pilum,</hi> he drew his ſword, and ruſhed forwards to cloſe with the enemy. His ſword was a ſhort well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered Spaniſh blade, that carried a double edge, and was alike ſuited to the purpoſe of ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or of puſhing; but the ſoldier was always inſtructed to prefer the latter uſe of his weapon, as his own body remained leſs expoſed, whilſt he inflicted a more dangerous wound on his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary <note n="45" place="bottom">For the legionary arms, ſee Lipſius de Militiâ Romanâ, l. iii. c. 2—7.</note>.

            <p>The cavalry, without which the force of the <note place="margin">Cavalry.</note> legion would have remained imperfect, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ten troops or ſquadrons; the firſt, as the companion of the firſt cohort, conſiſted of an hundred and thirty-two men; whilſt each of the other nine amounted only to ſixty-ſix. The entire eſtabliſhment formed a regiment, if we may uſe the modern expreſſion, of ſeven hundred and twenty-ſix horſe, naturally connected with its reſpective legion, but occaſionally ſeparated to act in the line, and to compoſe a part of the wings of the army <note n="50" place="bottom">Veget. de Re Militari, l. ii. c. 6. His poſitive teſtimony, which might be ſupported by circumſtantial evidence, ought ſurely to ſilence thoſe critics who refuſe the Imperial legion its proper body of cavalry.</note>.

            <p>Such were the arts of war, by which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Number and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> emperors defended their extenſive conqueſts, and preſerved a military ſpirit, at a time when every other virtue was oppreſſed by luxury and deſpotiſm. If, in the conſideration of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we paſs from their diſcipline to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, we ſhall not find it eaſy to define them with any tolerable accuracy. We may compute, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the legion, which was itſelf a body of ſix thouſand eight hundred and thirty-one Romans, might, with its attendant auxiliaries, amount to about twelve thouſand five hundred men. The peace eſtabliſhment of Hadrian and his ſucceſſors was compoſed of no leſs than thirty of theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable brigades; and moſt probably formed a ſtanding force of three hundred and ſeventy-five thouſand men. Inſtead of being confined within the walls of fortified cities, which the Romans conſidered as the refuge of weakneſs or puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the legions were encamped on the banks of the great rivers, and along the frontiers of the barbarians. As their ſtations, for the moſt part, remained fixed and permanent, we may venture to deſcribe the diſtribution of the troops. Three legions were ſufficient for Britain. The principal ſtrength lay upon the Rhine and Danube, and conſiſted of ſixteen legions, in the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions: two in the Lower, and three in the Upper Germany; one in Rhaetia, one in Nori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, four in Pannonia, three in Maeſia, and two in Dacia. The defence of the Euphrates was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0034700101:52"/>
entruſted to eight legions, ſix of whom were planted in Syria, and the other two in Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia. With regard to Egypt, Africa, and Spain, as they were far removed from any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſcene of war, a ſingle legion maintained the domeſtic tranquillity of each of thoſe great provinces. Even Italy was not left deſtitute of a military force. Above twenty thouſand choſen ſoldiers, diſtinguiſhed by the titles of City Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts and Praetorian Guards, watched over the ſafety of the monarch and the capital. As the authors of almoſt every revolution that diſtracted the empire, the Praetorians will, very ſoon, and very loudly, demand our attention; but in their arms and inſtitutions, we cannot find any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which diſcriminated them from the legions, unleſs it were a more ſplendid appearance, and a leſs rigid diſcipline <note n="65" place="bottom">Tacitus (Annal. iv. 5.) has given us a ſtate of the legions under Tiberius: and Dion Caſſius (l. lv. p. 794.) under Alexander Severus.

The policy of the emperors was directed only to preſerve the peaceful dominion of that ſea, and to protect the commerce of their ſubjects. With theſe moderate views, Auguſtus ſtationed two permanent fleets in the moſt convenient ports of Italy, the one at Ravenna, on the Adriatic, the other at Miſenum, in the bay of Naples. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſeems at length to have convinced the ancients, that as ſoon as their gallies exceeded two, or at the moſt three ranks of oars, they were ſuited rather for vain pomp than for real ſervice.

by forty ſhips, and three thouſand ſoldiers. To all theſe we add the fleet which preſerved the communication between Gaul and Britain, and a great number of veſſels conſtantly maintained on the Rhine and Danube, to haraſs the country, or to intercept the paſſage of the barbarians <note n="68" place="bottom">See Lipſius, de Magnitud.

two ſovereigns, was diſtributed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus into three provinces, Luſitania, Baetica, and Tarraconenſis. The kingdom of Portugal now fills the place of the warlike country of the Luſitanians; and the loſs ſuſtained by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, on the ſide of the Eaſt, is compenſated by an acceſſion of territory towards the North. The confines of Grenada and Andaluſia correſpond with thoſe of ancient Baetica. The remainder of Spain, Gallicia and the Aſturias, Biſcay and Navarre, Leon and the two Caſtilles, Murcia, Valencia, Catalonia, and Arragon, all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to form the third and moſt conſiderable of the Roman governments, which, from the name of its capital, was ſtyled the province of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragona <note n="70" place="bottom">See Strabo, l. ii. It is natural enough to ſuppoſe, that Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon is derived from Tarraconenſis, and ſeveral moderns who have written in Latin, uſe thoſe words as ſynonymous. It is however certain, that the Arragon, a little ſtream which falls from the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renees into the Ebro, firſt gave its name to a country, and gradually to a kingdom. See d'Anville, Geographie du Moyen Age, p. 181.</note>. Of the native barbarians, the Celti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berians were the moſt powerful, as the Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians and Aſturians proved the moſt obſtinate.

            <p>Ancient Gaul, as it contained the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <note place="margin">Gaul.</note> between the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Rhine, and the Ocean, was of greater extent than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern France.

Savoy, the cantons of Switzerland, the four elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torates of the Rhine, and the territories of Liege, Luxemburgh, Hainault, Flanders, and Brabant. When Auguſtus gave laws to the conqueſts of his father, he introduced a diviſion of Gaul equally adapted to the progreſs of the legions, to the courſe of the rivers, and to the principal national diſtinctions, which had comprehended above an hundred independent ſtates <note n="71" place="bottom">One hundred and fifteen <hi>cities</hi> appear in the Notitia of Gaul; and it is well known that this appellation was applied not only to the capital town, but to the whole territory of each ſtate. But Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch and Appian increaſe the number of tribes to three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note>. The ſea-coaſt of the Mediterranean, Languedoc, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, and Dauphiné, received their provincial appellation from the colony of Narbonne. The government of Aquitaine was extended from the Pyrenees to the Loire. The country between the Loire and the Seine was ſtyled the Celtic Gaul, and ſoon borrowed a new denomination from the celebrated colony of Lugdunum, or Lyons. The Belgic lay beyond the Seine, and in more ancient times had been bounded only by the Rhine; but a little before the age of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, the Germans, abuſing their ſuperiority of valour, had occupied a conſiderable portion of the Belgic territory. The Roman conquerors very eagerly embraced ſo flattering a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the Gallic frontier of the Rhine, from Baſil to Leyden, received the pompous names of the Upper and the Lower Germany <note n="72" place="bottom">D'Anville.

            <p>We have already had occaſion to mention the <note place="margin">Britain.</note> conqueſt of Britain, and to fix the boundary of the Roman province in this iſland. It compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all England, Wáles, and the Lowlands of Scotland, as far as the Friths of Dunbarton and Edinburgh. Before Britain loſt her freedom, the country was irregularly divided between thirty tribes of barbarians, of whom the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able were the Belgae in the Weſt, the Brigantes in the North, the Silures in South Wales, and the Iceni in Norfolk and Suffolk <note n="73" place="bottom">Whitaker's Hiſtory of Mancheſter, vol. i. c. 3.</note>. As far as we can either trace or credit the reſemblance of manners and language, Spain, Gaul, and Britain were peopled by the ſame hardy race of ſavages. Before they yielded to the Roman arms, they often diſputed the field, and often renewed the conteſt. After their ſubmiſſion they conſtituted the weſtern diviſion of the European provinces, which extended from the columns of Hercules to the wall of Antoninus, and from the mouth of the Tagus to the ſources of the Rhine and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube.</p>
            <p>Before the Roman conqueſt, the country which <note place="margin">Italy.</note> is now called Lombardy, was not conſidered as a part of Italy. It had been occupied by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful colony of Gauls, who ſettling themſelves along the banks of the Po, from Piedmont to Romagna, carried their arms and diffuſed their name from the Alps to the Apennine. The
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0034700101:58"/>
Ligurians dwelt on the rocky coaſt, which now forms the republic of Genoa. Venice was yet unborn; but the territories of that ſtate, which lie to the eaſt of the Adige, were inhabited by the Venetians <note n="74" place="bottom">The Italian Veneti, though often confounded with the Gauls, were more probably of Illyrian origin. See M. Freret, Memoires de l'Academie des Inſcriptions, tom. xviii.</note>. The middle part of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſula that now compoſes the dutchy of Tuſcany and the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, was the ancient ſeat of the Etruſcans and Umbrians; to the former of whom Italy was indebted for the firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of civilized life <note n="75" place="bottom">See Maffei Verona illuſtrata, l. i.</note>. The Tyber rolled at the foot of the ſeven hills of Rome, and the country of the Sabines, the Latins, and the Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſci, from that river to the frontiers of Naples, was the theatre of her infant victories.

The provinces of the Danube ſoon acquired the general appellation of Illyricum, or the Illyrian frontier <note n="79" place="bottom">The name of Illyricum originally belonged to the ſea-coaſt of the Hadriatic, and was gradually extended by the Romans from the Alps to the Euxine Sea.

In their original ſtate of independence, their fierce inhabitants were intimately connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Under the Roman government they were frequently united, and they ſtill remain the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of a ſingle family. They now contain the reſidence of a German prince, who ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Emperor of the Romans, and form the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as ſtrength, of the Auſtrian power. It may not be improper to obſerve, that if we except Bohemia, Moravia, the northern ſkirts of Auſtria, and a part of Hungary, between the Teyſs and the Danube, all the other dominions of the Houſe of Auſtria were compriſed within the limits of the Roman empire.</p>
            <p>Dalmatia, to which the name of Illyricum <note place="margin">Dalmatia.</note> more properly belonged, was a long, but narrow tract, between the Save and the Adriatic. The beſt part of the ſea-coaſt, which ſtill retains its ancient appellation, is a province of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſtate, and the ſeat of the little republic of Raguſa. The inland parts have aſſumed the Sclavonian names of Croatia and Boſnia; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obeys an Auſtrian governor, the latter a Turkiſh paſha; but the whole country is ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by tribes of barbarians, whoſe ſavage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence irregularly marks the doubtful limit of the Chriſtian and Mahometan power <note n="80" place="bottom">A Venetian traveller, the Abbate Fortis, has lately given us ſome account of thoſe very obſcure countries.

After the Danube had received the waters of the Teyſs and the Save, it acquired, at leaſt, among the Greeks, the name of Iſter <note n="81" place="bottom">The Save riſes near the confines of <hi>Iſtria,</hi> and was conſidered by the more early Greeks as the principal ſtream of the Danube.</note>. It for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <note place="margin">Maeſia and Dacia.</note> divided Maeſia and Dacia, the latter of which, as we have already ſeen, was a conqueſt of Trajan, and the only province beyond the river. If we inquire into the preſent ſtate of thoſe countries, we ſhall find that, on the left hand of the Danube, Temeſwar and Tranſylvania have been annexed, after many revolutions, to the crown of Hungary; whilſt the principalities of Moldavia and Walachia acknowledge the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the Ottoman Porte. On the right hand of the Danube, Maeſia, which, during the middle ages, was broken into the barbarian kingdoms of Servia and Bulgaria, is again united in Turkiſh ſlavery.</p>
            <p>The appellation of Roumelia, which is ſtill <note place="margin">Thrace, Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and Greece.</note> beſtowed by the Turks on the extenſive countries of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece, preſerves the memory of their ancient ſtate under the Roman empire. In the time of the Antonines, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial regions of Thrace, from the mountains of Haemus and Rhodope, to the Boſphorus and the Helleſpont, had aſſumed the form of a province. Notwithſtanding the change of maſters and of religion, the new city of Rome, founded by Conſtantine on the banks of the Boſphorus, has ever ſince remained the capital of a great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. The kingdom of Macedonia, which,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0034700101:62"/>
under the reign of Alexander, gave laws to Aſia, derived more ſolid advantages from the policy of the two Philips; and with its dependencies of Epirus and Theſſaly, extended from the Aegean to the Ionian ſea. When we reflect on the fame of Thebes and Argos, of Sparta and Athens, we can ſcarcely perſuade ourſelves, that ſo many immortal republics of antient Greece were loſt in a ſingle province of the Roman empire, which, from the ſuperior influence of the Achaean league, was uſually denominated the province of Achaia.</p>
            <p>Such was the ſtate of Europe under the Roman <note place="margin">Aſia Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</note> emperors. The provinces of Aſia, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the tranſient conqueſts of Trajan, are all comprehended within the limits of the Turkiſh power. But, inſtead of following the arbitrary diviſions of deſpotiſm and ignorance, it will be ſafer for us, as well as more agreeable, to obſerve the indelible characters of nature. The name of Aſia Minor is attributed with ſome propriety to the peninſula, which, confined between the Eux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and the Mediterranean, advances from the Euphrates towards Europe. The moſt extenſive and flouriſhing diſtrict, weſtward of mount Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus and the river Halys, was dignified by the Romans with the excluſive title of Aſia. The juriſdiction of that province extended over the ancient monarchies of Troy, Lydia, and Phrygia, the maritime countries of the Pamphylians, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and Carians, and the Grecian colonies of Ionia, which equalled in arts, though not in arms, the glory of their parent. The kingdoms of Bithynia and Pontus poſſeſſed the northern ſide
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0034700101:63"/>
of the peninſula from Conſtantinople to Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zond. On the oppoſite ſide, the province of Cilicia was terminated by the mountains of Syria: the inland country, ſeparated from the Roman Aſia by the river Halys, and from Armenia by the Euphrates, had once formed the independent kingdom of Cappadocia. In this place we may obſerve, that the northern ſhores of the Euxine, beyond Trebizond in Aſia, and beyond the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube in Europe, acknowledged the ſovereignty of the emperors, and received at their hands, either tributary princes or Roman garriſons. Budzak, Crim Tartary, Circaſſia, and Mingrelia, are the modern appellations of thoſe ſavage coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries <note n="82" place="bottom">See the Periplus of Arrian. He examined the coaſts of the Euxine, when he was governor of Cappadocia.</note>.</p>
            <p>Under the ſucceſſors of Alexander, Syria was <note place="margin">Syria, Phoenicia, and Paleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</note> the ſeat of the Seleucidae, who reigned over Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Aſia, till the ſucceſsful revolt of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians confined their dominions between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean. When Syria became ſubject to the Romans, it formed the eaſtern frontier of their empire; nor did that province, in its utmoſt latitude, know any other bounds than the mountains of Cappadocia to the north, and towards the ſouth, the confines of Egypt, and the Red Sea. Phoenicia and Paleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine were ſometimes annexed to, and ſometimes ſeparated from, the juriſdiction of Syria. The former of theſe was a narrow and rocky coaſt; the latter was a territory ſcarcely ſuperior to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0034700101:64"/>
Wales, either in fertility or extent. Yet Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia and Paleſtine will for ever live in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of mankind; ſince America, as well as Europe, has received letters from the one, and religion from the other <note n="83" place="bottom">The progreſs of religion is well known. The uſe of letters was introduced among the ſavages of Europe about fifteen hundred years before Chriſt; and the Europeans carried them to America, about fifteen centuries after the Chriſtian aera.

Till the arrival of the Phoenician colonies, that fertile country was inhabited by the Libyans, the moſt ſavage of mankind. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the immediate juriſdiction of Carthage, it became the center of commerce and empire; but the republic of Carthage is now degenerated into the feeble and diſorderly ſtates of Tripoli and Tunis. The military government of Algiers oppreſſes the wide extent of Numidia, as it was once united under Maſſiniſſa and Jugurtha: but in the time of Auguſtus, the limits of Numidia were contracted; and, at leaſt, two thirds of the country acquieſced in the name of Mauritania, with the epithet of Caeſarienſis.

Of the larger iſlands, the two Baleares, which derive their name of Majorca and Minorca from their reſpective ſize, are ſubject at preſent, the former to Spain, the latter to Great Britain. It is eaſier to deplore the fate, than to deſcribe the actual condition of Corſica. Two Italian ſovereigns aſſume a regal title from Sardinia and Sicily.

            <p>IT is not alone by the rapidity, or extent of conqueſt, that we ſhould eſtimate the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Rome. The ſovereign of the Ruſſian <note place="margin">Principles of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> deſerts commands a larger portion of the globe. In the ſeventh ſummer after his paſſage of the Helleſpont, Alexander erected the Macedonian trophies on the banks of the Hyphaſis <note n="1" place="bottom">They were erected about the midway between Lahor and Dehli. The conqueſts of Alexander in Hindoſtan were confined to the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, a country watered by the five great ſtreams of the Indus.</note>. Within leſs than a century, the irreſiſtible Zingis, and the Mogul princes of his race, ſpread their cruel devaſtations and tranſient empire, from the ſea of China, to the confines of Egypt and Germany <note n="2" place="bottom">See M. de Guignes Hiſtoire des Huns, l. xv, xvi, and xvii.</note>. But the firm edifice of Roman power was raiſed and preſerved by the wiſdom of ages. The obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient provinces of Trajan and the Antonines were united by laws, and adorned by arts. They might occaſionally ſuffer from the partial abuſe of delegated authority; but the general principle of government was wiſe, ſimple, and beneficent. They enjoyed the religion of their anceſtors, whilſt in civil honours and advantages they were exalted, by juſt degrees, to an equality with their conquerors.</p>

I. The policy of the emperors and the ſenate, as far as it concerned religion, was happily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the reflections of the enlightened, and <note place="margin">Univerſal ſpirit of toleration.</note> by the habits of the ſuperſtitious, part of their ſubjects. The various modes of worſhip, which prevailed in the Roman world, were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by the people, as equally true; by the philoſopher, as equally falſe; and by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, as equally uſeful. And thus toleration produced not only mutual indulgence, but even religious concord.</p>
            <p>The ſuperſtition of the people was not embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <note place="margin">Of the people.</note> by any mixture of theological rancour; nor was it confined by the chains of any ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſyſtem. The devout polytheiſt, though fondly attached to his national rites, admitted with implicit faith the different religions of the earth <note n="3" place="bottom">There is not any writer who deſcribes in ſo lively a manner as Herodotus, the true genius of Polytheiſm. The beſt commentary may be found in Mr. Hume's Natural Hiſtory of Religion; and the beſt contraſt in Bouſſuet's Univerſal Hiſtory. Some obſcure traces of an intolerant ſpirit appear in the conduct of the Egyptians (ſee Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Sat. xv.); and the Chriſtians as well as Jews, who lived under the Roman empire, formed a very important exception: ſo important indeed, that the diſcuſſion will require a diſtinct chapter of this work.</note>. Fear, gratitude, and curioſity, a dream or an omen, a ſingular diſorder, or a diſtant journey, perpetually diſpoſed him to multiply the articles of his belief, and to enlarge the liſt of his protectors. The thin texture of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan mythology was interwoven with various, but not diſcordant materials. As ſoon as it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that ſages and heroes, who had lived, or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0034700101:71"/>
who had died for the benefit of their country, were exalted to a ſtate of power and immortality, it was univerſally confeſſed, that they deſerved, if not the adoration, at leaſt the reverence, of all mankind. The deities of a thouſand groves and a thouſand ſtreams poſſeſſed, in peace, their local and reſpective influence; nor could the Roman who deprecated the wrath of the Tiber, deride the Egyptian who preſented his offering to the beneficent genius of the Nile. The viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble powers of Nature, the planets, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were the ſame throughout the univerſe. The inviſible governors of the moral world were inevitably caſt in a ſimilar mould of fiction and allegory. Every virtue, and even vice, acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its divine repreſentative; every art and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion its patron, whoſe attributes, in the moſt diſtant ages and countries, were uniformly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the character of their peculiar vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. A republic of gods of ſuch oppoſite tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and intereſt required, in every ſyſtem, the moderating hand of a ſupreme magiſtrate, who, by the progreſs of knowledge and flattery, was gradually inveſted with the ſublime perfections of an Eternal Parent, and an Omnipotent Monarch <note n="4" place="bottom">The rights, powers, and pretenſions of the ſovereign of Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, are very clearly deſcribed in the xvth book of the Iliad: in the Greek original, I mean; for Mr. Pope, without perceiving it, has improved the theology of Homer.</note>. Such was the mild ſpirit of antiquity, that the nations were leſs attentive to the difference, than to the reſemblance, of their religious worſhip. The Greek, the Roman, and the Barbarian, as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0034700101:72"/>
they met before their reſpective altars, eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded themſelves, that under various names; and with various ceremonies, they adored the ſame deities. The elegant mythology of Homer gave a beautiful, and almoſt a regular form, to the polytheiſm of the ancient world <note n="5" place="bottom">See for inſtance, Caeſar de Bell. Gall. vi. 17. Within a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury or two the Gauls themſelves applied to their gods the names of Mercury, Mars, Apollo, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>The philoſophers of Greece deduced their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals <note place="margin">Of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.</note> from the nature of man, rather than from that of God. They meditated, however, on the Divine Nature, as a very curious and important ſpeculation; and in the profound inquiry, they diſplayed the ſtrength and weakneſs of the human underſtanding <note n="6" place="bottom">The admirable work of Cicero de Naturâ Deorum, is ſhe beſt clue we have to guide us through the dark and profound abyſs. He repreſents with candour, and confutes with ſubtlety, the opinions of the philoſophers.</note>. Of the four moſt celebrated ſchools, the Stoics and the Platoniſts endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reconcile the jarring intereſts of reaſon and piety. They have left us the moſt ſublime proofs of the exiſtence and perfections of the firſt cauſe; but, as it was impoſſible for them to conceive the creation of matter, the workman in the Stoic philoſophy was not ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed from the work; whilſt, on the contrary, the ſpiritual God of Plato and his diſciples, reſembled an idea, rather than a ſubſtance. The opinions of the Academics and Epicureans were of a leſs religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous caſt; but whilſt the modeſt ſcience of the former induced them to doubt, the poſitive ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0034700101:73"/>
of the latter urged them to deny, the providence of a Supreme Ruler. The ſpirit of inquiry, prompted by emulation, and ſupported by freedom, had divided the public teachers of philoſophy into a variety of contending ſects; but the ingenuous youth, who, from every part, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to Athens, and the other ſeats of learning in the Roman empire, were alike inſtructed in every ſchool to reject and to deſpiſe the religion of the multitude. How, indeed, was it poſſible, that a philoſopher ſhould accept, as divine truths, the idle tales of the poets, and the incoherent traditions of antiquity; or, that he ſhould adore, as gods, thoſe imperfect beings whom he muſt have deſpiſed, as men! Againſt ſuch unworthy adverſaries, Cicero condeſcended to employ the arms of reaſon and eloquence; but the ſatire of Lucian was a much more adequate, as well as more efficacious weapon. We may be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that a writer, converſant with the world, would never have ventured to expoſe the gods of his country to public ridicule, had they not already been the objects of ſecret contempt among the poliſhed and enlightened orders of ſociety <note n="7" place="bottom">I do not pretend to aſſert, that, in this irreligious age, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural terrors of ſuperſtition, dreams, omens, apparitions, &amp;c. had loſt their efficacy.</note>.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the faſhionable irreligion which prevailed in the age of the Antonines, both the intereſts of the prieſts and the credulity of the people were ſufficiently reſpected. In their writings and converſation, the philoſophers of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0034700101:74"/>
antiquity aſſerted the independent dignity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but they reſigned their actions to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of law and of cuſtom. Viewing, with a ſmile of pity and indulgence, the various errors of the vulgar, they diligently practiſed the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their fathers, devoutly frequented the temples of the gods; and ſometimes condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to act a part on the theatre of ſuperſtition, they concealed the ſentiments of an Atheiſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſacerdotal robes. Reaſoners of ſuch a temper were ſcarcely inclined to wrangle about their reſpective modes of faith, or of worſhip. It was indifferent to them what ſhape the folly of the multitude might chuſe to aſſume; and they approached, with the ſame inward contempt, and the ſame external reverence, the altars of the Lybian, the Olympian, or the Capitoline Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note n="8" place="bottom">Socrates, Epicurus, Cicero, and Plutarch, always inculcated a decent reverence for the religion of their own country, and of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The devotion of Epicurus was aſſiduous and exemplary. Diogen. Laert. x. 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is not eaſy to conceive from what motives a <note place="margin">Of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</note> ſpirit of perſecution could introduce itſelf into the Roman councils. The magiſtrates could not be actuated by a blind, though honeſt bigotry, ſince the magiſtrates were themſelves philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; and the ſchools of Athens had given laws to the ſenate. They could not be impelled by ambition or avarice, as the temporal and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical powers were united in the ſame hands. The pontiffs were choſen among the moſt illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious of the ſenators; and the office of Supreme
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0034700101:75"/>
Pontiff was conſtantly exerciſed by the emperors themſelves. They knew and valued the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of religion, as it is connected with civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. They encouraged the public feſtivals which humanize the manners of the people. They managed the arts of divination, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient inſtrument of policy; and they reſpected as the firmeſt bond of ſociety, the uſeful perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that, either in this or in a future life, the crime of perjury is moſt aſſuredly puniſhed by the avenging gods <note n="9" place="bottom">Polybius, l. vi. c. 53, 54. Juvenal, Sat. xiii. laments, that in his time this apprehenſion had loſt much of its effect.</note>. But whilſt they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the general advantages of religion, they were convinced, that the various modes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip contributed alike to the ſame ſalutary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; and that, in every country, the form of ſuperſtition, which had received the ſanction of time and experience, was the beſt adapted to the climate, and to its inhabitants. Avarice and <note place="margin">In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;</note> taſte very frequently deſpoiled the vanquiſhed nations of the elegant ſtatues of their gods, and the rich ornaments of their temples <note n="10" place="bottom">See the fate of Syracuſe, Tarentum, Ambracia, Corinth, &amp;c. the conduct of Verres, in Cicero (Actio ii. Orat. 4.), and the uſual practice of governors, in the viiith Satire of Juvenal.</note>: but, in the exerciſe of the religion which they derived from their anceſtors, they uniformly experienced the indulgence, and even protection, of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conquerors. The province of Gaul ſeems, and indeed only ſeems, an exception to this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal toleration.

Every city in the empire was juſtified in maintaining the purity of its ancient ceremonies; and the Roman ſenate, uſing the common privilege, ſometimes interpoſed, to check this inundation of foreign rites. The Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſuperſtition, of all the moſt contemptible and abject, was frequently prohibited; the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Serapis and Iſis demoliſhed, and their worſhippers baniſhed from Rome and Italy <note n="15" place="bottom">In the year of Rome 701, the temple of Iſis and Serapis was demoliſhed by the order of the ſenate (Dion Caſſius, l. xl. p. 252.), and even by the hands of the conſul (Valerius Maximus, 1. 3.). After the death of Caeſar, it was reſtored at the public expence (Dion, l. xlvii. p. 501.). When Auguſtus was in Egypt, he rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the majeſty of Serapis (Dion, l. li. p. 647.); but in the Pomaerium of Rome, and a mile round it, he prohibited the worſhip of the Egyptian gods (Dion, l. liii. p. 679. l. liv. p. 735.). They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, however, very faſhionable under his reign (Ovid. de Art. Amand. l. i.) and that of his ſucceſſor, till the juſtice of Tiberius was provoked to ſome acts of ſeverity. (See Tacit. Annal. ii. 85. Joſeph. Antiquit. l. xviii. c. 3.)</note>. But the zeal of fanaticiſm prevailed over the cold and feeble efforts of policy. The exiles return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the proſelytes multiplied, the temples were reſtored with increaſing ſplendor, and Iſis and

The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring genius of Rome ſacrificed vanity to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and deemed it more prudent, as well as honourable, to adopt virtue and merit for her own whereſoever they were found, among ſlaves or ſtrangers, enemies or barbarians <note n="20" place="bottom">Tacit.

If, on the contrary, we ſtudy the growth of the Roman republic, we may diſcover, that, notwithſtanding the inceſſant demands of wars and colonies, the citizens, who, in the firſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of Servius Tullius, amounted to no more than eighty-three thouſand, were multiplied, before the commencement of the ſocial war, to the number of four hundred and ſixty-three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, able to bear arms in the ſervice of their country <note n="23" place="bottom">See a very accurate collection of the numbers of each Luſtrum in M. de Beaufort, Republique Romaine, l. iv. c. 4.</note>. When the allies of Rome claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an equal ſhare of honours and privileges, the ſenate indeed preferred the chance of arms to an ignominious conceſſion. The Samnites and the Lucanians paid the ſevere penalty of their raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but the reſt of the Italian ſtates, as they ſucceſſively returned to their duty, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the boſom of the republic <note n="24" place="bottom">Appian. de Bell. civil. l. i.

But when the popular aſſemblies had been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the adminiſtration of the emperors, the conquerors were diſtinguiſhed from the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nations, only as the firſt and moſt honourable order of ſubjects; and their increaſe, however rapid, was no longer expoſed to the ſame dangers.

Yet the wiſeſt princes, who adopted the maxims of Auguſtus, guarded with the ſtricteſt care the dignity of the Roman name, and diffuſed the freedom of the city with a prudent liberality <note n="25" place="bottom">Maecenas had adviſed him to declare by one edict, all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, citizens. But we may juſtly ſuſpect that the hiſtorian Dion was the author of a counſel, ſo much adapted to the practice of his own age, and ſo little to that of Auguſtus.</note>.</p>
            <p>Till the privileges of Romans had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſively <note place="margin">Italy.</note> extended to all the inhabitants of the empire, an important diſtinction was preſerved between Italy and the provinces. The former was eſteemed the centre of public unity, and the firm baſis of the conſtitution. Italy claimed the birth, or at leaſt the reſidence, of the emperors and the ſenate <note n="26" place="bottom">The ſenators were obliged to have one-third of their own land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed property in Italy. See Plin. l. vi. ep. 19. The qualification was reduced by Marcus to one-fourth. Since the reign of Trajan, Italy had ſunk nearer to the level of the provinces.</note>. The eſtates of the Italians were exempt from taxes, their perſons from the arbitrary juriſdiction of governors. Their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal corporations, formed after the perfect model of the capital, were intruſted, under the immediate eye of the ſupreme power, with the execution of the laws. From the foot of the Alps to the extremity of Calabria, all the natives of Italy were born citizens of Rome. Their partial diſtinctions were obliterated, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly coaleſced into one great nation, united by language, manners, and civil inſtitutions, and equal to the weight of a powerful empire. The republic gloried in her generous policy, and was frequently rewarded by the merit and ſervices of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0034700101:80"/>
her adopted ſons. Had ſhe always confined the diſtinction of Romans to the ancient families within the walls of the city, that immortal name would have been deprived of ſome of its nobleſt ornaments. Virgil was a native of Mantua; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race was inclined to doubt whether he ſhould call himſelf an Apulian or a Lucanian: it was in Padua that an hiſtorian was found worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord the majeſtic ſeries of Roman victories. The patriot family of the Catos emerged from Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum; and the little town of Arpinum claimed the double honour of producing Marius and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero, the former of whom deſerved, after Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus and Camillus, to be ſtyled the Third Founder of Rome; and the latter, after ſaving his country from the deſigns of Catiline, enabled her to contend with Athens for the palm of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <note n="27" place="bottom">The firſt part of the Verona Illuſtrata of the Marquis Maffei, gives the cleareſt and moſt comprehenſive view of the ſtate of Italy under the Caeſars.</note>.</p>
            <p>The provinces of the empire (as they have <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</note> been deſcribed in the preceding chapter) were deſtitute of any public force, or conſtitutional freedom. In Etruria, in Greece <note n="28" place="bottom">See Pauſanias, l. vii.

Hiſtoire de l'Etabliſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment de la Monarchie Françoiſe, l. i. c. 4.</note>, it was the firſt care of the ſenate to diſſolve thoſe dangerous conſederacies, which taught mankind, that, as the Roman arms prevailed by diviſion,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0034700101:81"/>
they might be reſiſted by union. Thoſe princes, whom the oſtentation of gratitude or generoſity permitted for a while to hold a precarious ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, were diſmiſſed from their thrones, as ſoon as they had performed their appointed taſk of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioning to the yoke the vanquiſhed nations. The free ſtates and cities which had embraced the cauſe of Rome, were rewarded with a nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal alliance, and inſenſibly ſunk into real ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The public authority was every where exerciſed by the miniſters of the ſenate and of the emperors, and that authority was abſolute, and without control. But the ſame ſalutary maxims of government, which had ſecured the peace and obedience of Italy, were extended to the moſt diſtant conqueſts. A nation of Romans was gradually formed in the provinces, by the double expedient of introducing colonies, and of admitting the moſt faithful and deſerving of the provincials to the freedom of Rome.</p>

The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Italy, allured by pleaſure or by intereſt, haſtened to enjoy the advantages of victory; and we may remark, that, about forty years after the reduction of Aſia, eighty thouſand Romans were maſſacred in one day, by the cruel orders of Mithridates <note n="31" place="bottom">Memnon apud Photium, c. 33.

But after the legions were rendered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent by the emperors, the provinces were peopled by a race of ſoldiers; and the veterans, whether they received the reward of their ſervice in land or in money, uſually ſettled with their families in the country, where they had honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſpent their youth. Throughout the empire, but more particularly in the weſtern parts, the moſt fertile diſtricts, and the moſt convenient ſituations, were reſerved for the eſtabliſhment of colonies; ſome of which were of a civil, and others of a military nature. In their manners and internal policy, the colonies formed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect repreſentation of their great parent; and they were ſoon endeared to the natives by the ties of friendſhip and alliance, they effectually diffuſed a reverence for the Roman name, and a deſire, which was ſeldom diſappointed, of ſharing, in due time, its honours and advantages <note n="32" place="bottom">Twenty-five colonies were ſettled in Spain (ſee Plin.

The municipal cities inſenſibly equalled the rank and ſplendour of the colonies; and in the reign of Hadrian, it was diſputed which was the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition, of thoſe ſocieties which had iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, or thoſe which had been received into, the boſom of Rome <note n="33" place="bottom">Aul.

So ſenſible were the Romans of the influence of language over national manners, that it was their moſt ſerious care to extend, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs <note place="margin">Diviſion of the Latin and the Greek provinces.</note> of their arms, the uſe of the Latin tongue <note n="37" place="bottom">See Plin.

The ancient dialects of Italy, the Sabine, the Etruſcan, and the Venetian, ſunk into oblivion; but in the provinces, the eaſt was leſs docile than the weſt, to the voice of its victorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors. This obvious difference marked the two portions of the empire with a diſtinction of colours, which, though it was in ſome degree concealed during the meridian ſplendor of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, became gradually more viſible, as the ſhades of night deſcended upon the Roman world. The weſtern countries were civilized by the ſame hands which ſubdued them. As ſoon as the barbarians were reconciled to obedience, their minds were opened to any new impreſſions of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and politeneſs. The language of Virgil and Cicero, though with ſome inevitable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of corruption, was ſo univerſally adopted in Africa, Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Pannonia <note n="38" place="bottom">Apuleius and Auguſtin will anſwer for Africa; Strabo for Spain and Gaul; Tacitus, in the life of Agricola, for Britain; and Velleius Paterculus, for Pannonia.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0034700101:85"/>
inſpired the natives of thoſe countries with the ſentiments of Romans; and Italy gave faſhions, as well as laws, to her Latin provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials. They ſolicited with more ardour, and obtained with more facility, the freedom and honours of the ſtate; ſupported the national dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in letters <note n="40" place="bottom">Spain alone produced Columella, the Senecas, Lucan, Martial, and Quintilian.</note> and in arms; and, at length, in the perſon of Trajan, produced an emperor whom the Scipios would not have diſowned for their countryman. The ſituation of the Greeks was very different from that of the barbarians. The former had been long ſince civilized and corrupted. They had too much taſte to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh their language, and too much vanity to adopt any foreign inſtitutions. Still preſerving the prejudices, after they had loſt the virtues, of their anceſtors, they affected to deſpiſe the unpoliſhed manners of the Roman conquerors, whilſt they were compelled to reſpect their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior wiſdom and power <note n="41" place="bottom">There is not, I believe, from Dionyſius to Libanius, a ſingle Greek critic who mentions Virgil or Horace.

Nor was the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Grecian language and ſentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the narrow limits of that once celebrated country. Their empire, by the progreſs of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies and conqueſt, had been diffuſed from the Hadriatic to the Euphrates and the Nile. Aſia
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0034700101:86"/>
was covered with Greek cities, and the long reign of the Macedonian kings had introduced a ſilent revolution into Syria and Egypt. In their pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous courts thoſe princes united the elegance of Athens with the luxury of the Eaſt, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the court was imitated, at an humble diſtance, by the higher ranks of their ſubjects. Such was the general diviſion of the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire into the Latin and Greek languages. To theſe we may add a third diſtinction for the body of the natives in Syria, and eſpecially in Egypt. The uſe of their ancient dialects, by ſecluding them from the commerce of mankind, checked the improvements of thoſe barbarians <note n="42" place="bottom">The curious reader may ſee in Dupin (Bibliotheque Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtique, tom. xix. p. 1. c. 8.) how much the uſe of the Syriac and Egyptian languages was ſtill preſerved.</note>.

            <p>It is a juſt though trite obſervation, that vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Rome was herſelf ſubdued by the arts of <note place="margin">General uſe of both languages.</note> Greece.

in Italy and the weſtern provinces. But the elegant amuſements of the Romans were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to interfere with their ſound maxims of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. Whilſt they acknowledged the charms of the Greek, they aſſerted the dignity of the Latin tongue, and the excluſive uſe of the latter was inflexibly maintained in the adminiſtration of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as well as military government <note n="45" place="bottom">See Valerius Maximus, l. ii. c. 2. n. 2.

Thoſe who united letters with buſineſs, were equally converſant with both; and it was almoſt impoſſible, in any province, to find a Roman ſubject, of a liberal education, who was at once a ſtranger to the Greek and to the Latin lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
            <p>It was by ſuch inſtitutions that the nations of <note place="margin">Slaves.</note> the empire inſenſibly melted away into the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man name and people. But there ſtill remained, in the centre of every province and of every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, an unhappy condition of men who endured the weight, without ſharing the benefits, of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. In the free ſtates of antiquity, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſlaves were expoſed to the wanton rigour of deſpotiſm. The perfect ſettlement of the <note place="margin">Their treatment.</note> Roman empire was preceded by ages of violence and rapine. The ſlaves conſiſted, for the moſt part, of barbarian captives, taken in thouſands
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0034700101:88"/>
by the chance of war, purchaſed at a vile price <note n="46" place="bottom">In the camp of Lucullus, an ox ſold for a drachma, and a ſlave for four drachmae, or about three ſhillings.

But when the principal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe, Aſia, and Africa, were united under the laws of one ſovereign, the ſource of foreign ſupplies flowed with much leſs abundance, and the Romans were reduced to the milder but more tedious method of propagation. In their numerous families, and particularly in their country eſtates, they encouraged the marriage of their ſlaves. The ſentiments of nature, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of education, and the poſſeſſion of a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſpecies of property, contributed to alleviate the hardſhips of ſervitude <note n="49" place="bottom">See in Gruter, and the other collectors, a great number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions addreſſed by ſlaves to their wives, children, fellow-ſervants, maſters, &amp;c.

The exiſtence of a ſlave became an object of greater value, and though his happineſs ſtill depended on the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and circumſtances of the maſter, the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the latter, inſtead of being reſtrained by

fear, was encouraged by the ſenſe of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. The progreſs of manners was accelerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the virtue or policy of the emperors; and by the edicts of Hadrian and the Antonines, the protection of the laws was extended to the moſt abject part of mankind. The juriſdiction of life and death over the ſlaves, a power long exerciſed and often abuſed, was taken out of private hands, and reſerved to the magiſtrates alone. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous priſons were aboliſhed; and, upon a juſt complaint of intolerable treatment, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured ſlave obtained either his deliverance, or a leſs cruel maſter <note n="50" place="bottom">See the Auguſtan Hiſtory, and a Diſſertation of M. de Burig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in the xxxvth volume of the Academy of Inſcriptions, upon the Roman ſlaves.</note>.</p>
            <p>Hope, the beſt comfort of our imperfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <note place="margin">Enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement.</note> was not denied to the Roman ſlave; and if he had any opportunity of rendering himſelf either uſeful or agreeable, he might very naturally expect that the diligence and fidelity of a few years would be rewarded with the ineſtimable gift of freedom. The benevolence of the maſter was ſo frequently prompted by the meaner ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of vanity and avarice, that the laws found it more neceſſary to reſtrain than to encourage a profuſe and undiſtinguiſhing liberality, which might degenerate into a very dangerous abuſe <note n="51" place="bottom">See another Diſſertation of M. de Burigny in the xxxviith vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, on the Roman freedmen.</note>.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0034700101:90"/>
ſociety of which his patron was a member. The conſequences of this maxim would have proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the privileges of the Roman city to a mean and promiſcuous multitude. Some ſeaſonable exceptions were therefore provided; and the honourable diſtinction was confined to ſuch ſlaves only, as for juſt cauſes, and with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the magiſtrate, ſhould receive a ſolemn and legal manumiſſion. Even theſe choſen freed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men obtained no more than the private rights of citizens, and were rigorouſly excluded from civil or military honours.

We are informed, that when the emperor Claudius exerciſed the office of cenſor, he took an account of ſix millions nine hundred and forty-five thouſand Roman citizens, who, with the proportion of women and children, muſt have amounted to about twenty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſouls. The multitude of ſubjects of an inferior rank, was uncertain and fluctuating. But, after weighing with attention every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which could influence the balance, it ſeems probable, that there exiſted, in the time of Claudius, about twice as many provincials as there were citizens, of either ſex, and of every age; and that the ſlaves were at leaſt equal in number to the free inhabitants of the Roman world. The total amount of this imperfect cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation would riſe to about one hundred and twenty millions of perſons: a degree of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

            <p>Domeſtic peace and union were the natural <note place="margin">Obedience and union.</note> conſequences of the moderate and comprehenſive policy embraced by the Romans. If we turn our eyes towards the monarchies of Aſia, we ſhall behold deſpotiſm in the center, and weakneſs in the extremities; the collection of the revenue, or the adminiſtration of juſtice, enforced by the preſence of an army; hoſtile barbarians eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heart of the country, hereditary ſatraps uſurping the dominion of the provinces, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects inclined to rebellion, though incapable of freedom. But the obedience of the Roman world was uniform, voluntary, and permanent. The vanquiſhed nations, blended into one great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, reſigned the hope, nay even the wiſh, of reſuming their independence, and ſcarcely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered their own exiſtence as diſtinct from the exiſtence of Rome. The eſtabliſhed authority of the emperors pervaded without an effort the wide extent of their dominions, and was exerciſed with the ſame facility on the banks of the Thames, or of the Nile, as on thoſe of the Tyber. The

The example of the ſovereign was imitated by his miniſters and generals; and his friend Agrippa left behind him the immortal monument of the Pantheon.</note>. The ſtrict oeconomy

At Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, a new forum, an aqueduct, and a canal, left unfiniſhed by a king; at Nice, a Gymnaſium, and a theatre which had already coſt near ninety thouſand pounds; baths at Pruſa and Claudiopolis; and an aqueduct of ſixteen miles in length for the uſe of Sinope.</note>. The opulent ſenators of Rome and the provinces eſteemed it an honour, and almoſt an obligation, to adorn the ſplendour of their age and country; and the influence of faſhion very frequently ſupplied the want of taſte or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity. Among a crowd of theſe private bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, we may ſelect Herodes Atticus, an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian citizen, who lived in the age of the Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines. Whatever might be the motive of his conduct, his magnificence would have been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the greateſt kings.</p>
            <p>The family of Herod, at leaſt after it had been <note place="margin">Example of Herodes Atticus.</note> favoured by fortune, was lineally deſcended from Cimon and Miltiades, Theſeus and Cecrops, Aeacus and Jupiter. But the poſterity of ſo many gods and heroes was fallen into the moſt abject ſtate. His grandfather had ſuffered by the hands of juſtice, and Julius Atticus, his father, muſt have ended his life in poverty and contempt, had he not diſcovered an immenſe treaſure buried under an old houſe, the laſt remains of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. According to the rigour of law, the emperor might have aſſerted his claim, and the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0034700101:97"/>
prudent Atticus prevented, by a frank confeſſion, the officiouſneſs of informers. But the equitable Nerva, who then filled the throne, refuſed to accept any part of it, and commanded him to uſe, without ſcruple, the preſent of fortune. The cautious Athenian ſtill inſiſted, that the treaſure was too conſiderable for a ſubject, and that he knew not how to <hi>uſe it.

Many will be of opinion, that Atticus literally obeyed the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's laſt inſtructions; ſince he expended the greateſt part of his fortune, which was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by an advantageous marriage, in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Public. He had obtained for his ſon Herod, the prefecture of the free cities of Aſia; and the young magiſtrate, obſerving that the town of Troas was indifferently ſupplied with water, obtained from the munificence of Hadrian, three hundred myriads of drachms (about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds) for the conſtruction of a new aqueduct. But in the execution of the work the charge amounted to more than double the eſtimate, and the officers of the revenue began to murmur, till the generous Atticus ſilenced their complaints, by requeſting that he might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to take upon himſelf the whole additional expence <note n="68" place="bottom">Philoſtrat. in Vit.

To the memory of his wife Regilla, he dedicated a theatre, ſcarcely to be paralleled in the empire: no wood except cedar, very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly carved, was employed in any part of the building. The Odeum, deſigned by Pericles for muſical performances, and the rehearſal of new tragedies, had been a trophy of the victory of the arts over Barbaric greatneſs; as the timbers employed in the conſtruction conſiſted chiefly of the maſts of the Perſian veſſels.

At a ſmall diſtance from thence was ſituated the Forum of Trajan.

Thoſe parts of Italy which have ſo long languiſhed under the lazy tyranny of prieſts and viceroys, had been afflicted only by the more tolerable calamities of war; and the firſt ſymptoms of decay, which <hi>they</hi> experienced, were amply compenſated by the rapid improvements of the Ciſalpine Gaul.

they contented themſelves with applying to all theſe new fruits the common denomination of apple, diſcriminating them from each other by the additional epithet of their country. 2. In <note place="margin">The vine.</note> the time of Homer, the vine grew wild in the iſland of Sicily, and moſt probably in the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent continent; but it was not improved by the ſkill, nor did it afford a liquor grateful to the taſte, of the ſavage inhabitants <note n="94" place="bottom">See Homer Odyſſ. l. ix. v. 358.</note>.

The accidental ſcarcity, in any ſingle province, was immediately relieved by the plenty of its more fortunate neighbours.</p>

Agriculture is the foundation of manufactures; ſince the productions of nature are the materials of art. Under the Roman empire, the labour of <note place="margin">Arts of luxury.</note> an induſtrious and ingenious people was variouſly, but inceſſantly employed, in the ſervice of the rich. In their dreſs, their table, their houſes, and their furniture, the favourites of fortune united every refinement of convenience, of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and of ſplendour; whatever could ſooth their pride, or gratify their ſenſuality. Such refinements, under the odious name of luxury, have been ſeverely arraigned by the moraliſts of every age; and it might perhaps be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the virtue, as well as happineſs, of mankind, if all poſſeſſed the neceſſaries, and none the ſuperfluities, of life. But in the preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect condition of ſociety, luxury, though it may proceed from vice or folly, ſeems to be the only means that can correct the unequal diſtribution of property. The diligent mechanic, and the ſkilful artiſt, who have obtained no ſhare in the diviſion of the earth, receive a voluntary tax from the poſſeſſors of land; and the latter are prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a ſenſe of intereſt, to improve thoſe eſtates, with whoſe produce they may purchaſe additional pleaſures. This operation, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular effects of which are felt in every ſociety, acted with much more diffuſive energy in the Roman world. The provinces would ſoon have been exhauſted of their wealth, if the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and commerce of luxury had not inſenſibly reſtored to the induſtrious ſubjects, the ſums which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0034700101:112"/>
were exacted from them by the arms and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Rome. As long as the circulation was confined within the bounds of the empire, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the political machine with a new degree of activity, and its conſequences, ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, could never become pernicious.</p>
            <p>But it is no eaſy taſk to confine luxury within <note place="margin">Foreign trade.</note> the limits of an empire. The moſt remote countries of the ancient world were ranſacked to ſupply the pomp and delicacy of Rome. The foreſt of Scythia afforded ſome valuable furs. Amber was brought over land from the ſhores of the Baltic to the Danube; and the barbarians were aſtoniſhed at the price which they received in exchange for ſo uſeleſs a commodity <note n="101" place="bottom">Tacit. Germania, c. 45. Plin. Hiſt. Nat. xxxviii. 11. The latter obſerved, with ſome humour, that even faſhion had not yet found out the uſe of amber. Nero ſent a Roman knight, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe great quantities on the ſpot, where it was produced; the coaſt of modern Pruſſia.</note>. There was a conſiderable demand for Babylonian carpets, and other manufactures of the Eaſt; but the moſt important and unpopular branch of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign trade was carried on with Arabia and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia. Every year, about the time of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſolſtice, a fleet of an hundred and twenty veſſels ſailed from Myos-hormos, a port of Egypt, on the Red Sea. By the periodical aſſiſtance of the Monſoons, they traverſed the ocean in about forty days. The coaſt of Malabar, or the iſland of Ceylon <note n="102" place="bottom">Called Taprobana by the Romans, and Screndib by the Arabs. It was diſcovered under the reign of Claudius, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually became the principal mart of the Eaſt.</note>, was the uſual term of their navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and it was in thoſe markets that the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0034700101:113"/>
merchants from the more remote countries of Aſia expected their arrival. The return of the fleet of Egypt was fixed to the months of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember or January; and as ſoon as their rich cargo had been tranſported on the backs of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, from the Red Sea to the Nile, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended that river as far as Alexandria, it was poured, without delay, into the capital of the empire <note n="103" place="bottom">Plin. Hiſt. Natur. l. vi. Strabo, l. xvii.</note>. The objects of oriental traffic were ſplendid and trifling: ſilk, a pound of which was eſteemed not inferior in value to a pound of gold <note n="104" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 224. A ſilk garment was conſidered as an ornament to a woman, but as a diſgrace to a man.</note>; precious ſtones, among which the pearl claimed the firſt rank after the diamond <note n="105" place="bottom">The two great pearl fiſheries were the ſame as at preſent, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz and Cape Comorin. As well as we can compare ancient with modern geography, Rome was ſupplied with diamonds from the mine of Jumelpur, in Bengal, which is deſcribed in the Voyages de Tavernier, tom. ii. p. 281.</note>; and a variety of aromatics, that were conſumed in religious worſhip and the pomp of funerals. The labour and riſk of the voyage was rewarded with almoſt incredible profit; but the profit was made upon Roman ſubjects, and a few indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals were enriched at the expence of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. As the natives of Arabia and India were <note place="margin">Gold and ſilver.</note> contented with the productions and manufactures of their own country, ſilver, on the ſide of the Romans, was the principal, if not the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of commerce. It was a complaint wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the gravity of the ſenate, that, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of female ornaments, the wealth of the ſtate
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0034700101:114"/>
was irrecoverably given away to foreign and hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile nations <note n="106" place="bottom">Tacit. Annal. iii. 52. In a ſpeech of Tiberius.</note>.

Hiſt. Natur. xii. 18. In another place he computes half that ſum; Quingenties H. S. for India excluſive of Arabia.</note>. Such was the ſtyle of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, brooding over the dark proſpect of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching poverty. And yet, if we compare the proportion between gold and ſilver, as it ſtood in the time of Pliny, and as it was fixed in the reign of Conſtantine, we ſhall diſcover within that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod a very conſiderable increaſe <note n="108" place="bottom">The proportion which was 1 to 10, and 12½, roſe to 14⅖, the legal regulation of Conſtantine. See Arbuthnot's Tables of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Coins, c. v.</note>. There is not the leaſt reaſon to ſuppoſe that gold was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ſcarce; it is therefore evident that ſilver was grown more common; that whatever might be the amount of the Indian and Arabian exports, they were far from exhauſting the wealth of the Roman world; and that the produce of the mines abundantly ſupplied the demands of commerce.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the propenſity of mankind to exalt the paſt, and to depreciate the preſent, the tranquil and proſperous ſtate of the empire was warmly felt, and honeſtly confeſſed, by the provincials as well as Romans. <q>They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <note place="margin">General felicity.</note> that the true principles of ſocial life, laws, agriculture, and ſcience, which had been firſt invented by the wiſdom of Athens, were now firmly eſtabliſhed by the power of Rome,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0034700101:115"/>
under whoſe auſpicious influence, the fierceſt barbarians were united by an equal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and common language. They affirm, that with the improvement of arts, the human ſpecies was viſibly multiplied. They cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the increaſing ſplendour of the cities, the beautiful face of the country, cultivated and adorned like an immenſe garden; and the long feſtival of peace, which was enjoyed by ſo many nations, forgetful of their ancient animoſities, and delivered from the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of future danger <note n="109" place="bottom">Among many other paſſages, ſee Pliny (Hiſt. Natur. iii. 5.), Ariſtides (de Urbe Româ), and Tertullian (de Animâ, c. 30.).</note>.</q> Whatever ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions may be ſuggeſted by the air of rhetoric and declamation, which ſeems to prevail in theſe paſſages, the ſubſtance of them is perfectly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to hiſtoric truth.</p>
            <p>It was ſcarcely poſſible that the eyes of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries <note place="margin">Decline of courage;</note> ſhould diſcover in the public felicity the latent cauſes of decay and corruption. This long peace, and the uniform government of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, introduced a ſlow and ſecret poiſon into the vitals of the empire. The minds of men were gradually reduced to the ſame level, the fire of genius was extinguiſhed, and even the military ſpirit evaporated. The natives of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope were brave and robuſt, Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Illyricum, ſupplied the legions with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſoldiers, and conſtituted the real ſtrength of the monarchy.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0034700101:116"/>
the ſenſe of national honour, the preſence of danger, and the habit of command. They received laws and governors from the will of their ſovereign, and truſted for their defence to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary army. The poſterity of their boldeſt leaders was contented with the rank of citizens and ſubjects. The moſt aſpiring ſpirits reſorted to the court or ſtandard of the emperors; and the deſerted provinces, deprived of political ſtrength or union, inſenſibly ſunk into the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid indifference of private life.</p>
            <p>The love of letters, almoſt inſeparable from <note place="margin">of genius.</note> peace and refinement, was faſhionable among the ſubjects of Hadrian and the Antonines, who were themſelves men of learning and curioſity. It was diffuſed over the whole extent of their empire; the moſt northern tribes of Britons had acquired a taſte for rhetoric; Homer as well as Virgil were tranſcribed and ſtudied on the banks of the Rhine and Danube; and the moſt liberal rewards ſought out the fainteſt glimmerings of literar merit <note n="110" place="bottom">
                  <p>Herodes Atticus gave the ſophiſt Polemo above eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds for three declamations. See Philoſtrat. l. i. p. 558. The Antonines founded a ſchool at Athens, in which profeſſors of grammar, rhetoric, politics, and the four great ſects of philoſophy, were maintained at the public expence for the inſtruction of youth. The ſalary of a philoſopher was ten thouſand drachmae, between three and four hundred pounds a year. Similar eſtabliſhments were formed in the other great cities of the empire.

were ſucceſsfully cultivated by the Greeks; the obſervations of Ptolemy and the writings of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len are ſtudied by thoſe who have improved their diſcoveries and corrected their errors; but if we except the inimitable Lucian, this age of indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence paſſed away without having produced a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle writer of original genius, or who excelled in the arts of elegant compoſition. The authority of Plato and Ariſtotle, of Zerno and Epicurus, ſtill reigned in the ſchools; and their ſyſtems, tranſmitted with blind deference from one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of diſciples to another, precluded every generous attempt to exerciſe the powers, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the limits, of the human mind. The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the poets and orators, inſtead of kindling a fire like their own, inſpired only cold and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile imitations: or if any ventured to deviate from thoſe models, they deviated at the ſame time from good ſenſe and propriety. On the revival of letters, the youthful vigour of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, after a long repoſe, national emulation, a new religion, new languages, and a new world, called forth the genius of Europe. But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials of Rome, trained by a uniform artificial foreign education, were engaged in a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal competition with thoſe bold ancients, who, by expreſſing their genuine feelings in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tongue, had already occupied every place of honour. The name of Poet was almoſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; that of Orator was uſurped by the ſophiſts. A cloud of critics, of compilers, of commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, darkened the face of learning, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of genius was ſoon followed by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of taſte.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE obvious definition of a monarchy ſeems to be that of a ſtate, in which a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by whatſoever name he may be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Idea of a monarchy.</note> is intruſted with the execution of the laws, the management of the revenue, and the command of the army. But, unleſs public liberty is protected by intrepid and vigilant guardians, the authority of ſo formidable a magiſtrate will ſoon degenerate into deſpotiſm. The influence of the clergy, in an age of ſuperſtition, might be uſefully employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſſert the rights of mankind; but ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is the connexion between the throne and the altar, that the banner of the church has very ſeldom been ſeen on the ſide of the people. A martial nobility and ſtubborn commons, poſſeſſed of arms, tenacious of property, and collected into conſtitutional aſſemblies, form the only balance capable of preſerving a free conſtitution againſt enterpriſes of an aſpiring prince.</p>
            <p>Every barrier of the Roman conſtitution had <note place="margin">Situation of Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> been levelled by the vaſt ambition of the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator; every fence had been extirpated by the cruel hand of the Triumvir. After the victory of Actium, the fate of the Roman world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the will of Octavianus, ſurnamed Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, by his uncle's adoption, and afterwards Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0034700101:120"/>
by the flattery of the ſenate. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror was at the head of forty-four veteran le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions <note n="1" place="bottom">Oroſius, vi. 18.</note>, conſcious of their own ſtrength, and of the weakneſs of the conſtitution, habituated, during twenty years civil war, to every act of blood and violence, and paſſionately devoted to the houſe of Caeſar, from whence alone they had received, and expected, the moſt laviſh rewards. The provinces, long oppreſſed by the miniſters of the republic, ſighed for the government of a ſingle perſon, who would be the maſter, not the accomplice, of thoſe petty tyrants. The people of Rome, viewing, with a ſecret pleaſure, the humiliation of the ariſtocracy, demanded only bread and public ſhows; and were ſupplied with both by the liberal hand of Auguſtus. The rich and polite Italians, who had almoſt univerſally embraced the philoſophy of Epicurus, enjoyed the preſent bleſſings of eaſe and tranquillity, and ſuffered not the pleaſing dream to be interrupted by the memory of their old tumultuous freedom. With its power, the ſenate had loſt its dignity; many of the moſt noble families were extinct. The republicans of ſpirit and ability had periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the field of battle, or in the proſcription. The door of the aſſembly had been deſignedly left open, for a mixed multitude of more than a thouſand perſons, who reflected diſgrace upon their rank, inſtead of deriving honour from it <note n="2" place="bottom">Julius Caeſar introduced ſoldiers, ſtrangers, and half-barbarians, into the ſenate (Sueton. in Caeſar. c. 77, 80.). The abuſe became ſtill more ſcandalous after his death.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0034700101:121"/>
The reformation of the ſenate, was one of the firſt ſteps in which Auguſtus laid aſide the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and profeſſed himſelf the father of his <note place="margin">He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the ſenate.</note> country. He was elected cenſor; and, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with his faithful Agrippa, he examined the liſt of the ſenators, expelled a few members, whoſe vices or whoſe obſtinacy required a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic example, perſuaded near two hundred to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſhame of an expulſion by a voluntary retreat, raiſed the qualification of a ſenator to about ten thouſand pounds, created a ſufficient number of Patrician families, and accepted for himſelf, the honourable title of Prince of the Senate, which had always been beſtowed, by the cenſors, on the citizen the moſt eminent for his honours and ſervices <note n="3" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius, l. iii. p. 693. Suetonius in Auguſt. c. 55.</note>. But whilſt he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the dignity, he deſtroyed the independence of the ſenate. The principles of a free conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution are irrecoverably loſt, when the legiſlative power is nominated by the executive.</p>
            <p>Before an aſſembly thus modelled and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, <note place="margin">Reſigns his uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power.</note> Auguſtus pronounced a ſtudied oration, which diſplayed his patriotiſm, and diſguiſed his ambition. <q>He lamented, yet excuſed, his paſt conduct. Filial piety had required at his hands the revenge of his father's murder; the humanity of his own nature had ſometimes given way to the ſtern laws of neceſſity, and to a forced connexion with two unworthy col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues: as long as Antony lived, the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0034700101:122"/>
forbad him to abandon her to a degenerate Roman, and a barbarian queen. He was now at liberty to ſatisfy his duty and his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſolemnly reſtored the ſenate and people to all their ancient rights; and wiſhed only to mingle with the crowd of his fellow-citizens, and to ſhare the bleſſings which he had obtained for his country <note n="4" place="bottom">Dion (l. liii. p. 698.) gives us a prolix and bombaſt ſpeech on this great occaſion. I have borrowed from Suetonius and Tacitus the general language of Auguſtus.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It would require the pen of Tacitus (if Tacitus <note place="margin">Is prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to reſume it under the title of Emperor or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note> had aſſiſted at this aſſembly) to deſcribe the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious emotions of the ſenate; thoſe that were ſuppreſſed, and thoſe that were affected. It was dangerous to truſt the ſincerity of Auguſtus; to ſeem to diſtruſt it, was ſtill more dangerous. The reſpective advantages of monarchy and a republic have often divided ſpeculative inquirers; the preſent greatneſs of the Roman ſtate, the corruption of manners, and the licence of the ſoldiers, ſupplied new arguments to the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of monarchy; and theſe general views of government were again warped by the hopes and fears of each individual. Amidſt this confuſion of ſentiments, the anſwer of the ſenate was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous and deciſive. They refuſed to accept the reſignation of Auguſtus; they conjured him not to deſert the republic, which he had ſaved. After a decent reſiſtance, the crafty tyrant ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the orders of the ſenate; and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive the government of the provinces,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0034700101:123"/>
and the general command of the Roman armies, under the well-known names of PROCONSUL and IMPERATOR <note n="5" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Imperator</hi> (from which we have derived Emperor) ſignified under the republic no more than <hi>general,</hi> and was emphatically beſtowed by the ſoldiers, when on the field of battle they proclaimed their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious leader worthy of that title. When the Roman <hi>emperors</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed it in that ſenſe, they placed it after their name, and marked how often they had taken it.</note>. But he would receive them only for ten years. Even before the expiration of that period, he hoped that the wounds of civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord would be completely healed, and that the republic, reſtored to its priſtine health and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, would no longer require the dangerous interpoſition of ſo extraordinary a magiſtrate. The memory of this comedy, repeated ſeveral times during the life of Auguſtus, was preſerved to the laſt ages of the empire, by the peculiar pomp with which the perpetual monarchs of Rome always ſolemnized the tenth years of their reign <note n="6" place="bottom">Dion, l. liii. p. 703, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>Without any violation of the principles of the <note place="margin">Power of the Roman generals:</note> conſtitution, the general of the Roman armies might receive and exerciſe an authority almoſt deſpotic over the ſoldiers, the enemies, and the ſubjects of the republic. With regard to the ſoldiers, the jealouſy of freedom had, even from the earlieſt ages of Rome, given way to the hopes of conqueſt, and a juſt ſenſe of military diſcipline. The dictator, or conſul, had a right to command the ſervice of the Roman youth; and to puniſh an obſtinate or cowardly diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the moſt ſevere and ignominious pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,

They violated the laws of nature and humanity, but they aſſerted thoſe of military diſcipline; and the people, who abhorred the action, was obliged to reſpect the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</note>. The choice of the enemies of Rome was regularly decided by the legiſlative authority. The moſt important reſolutions of peace and war were ſeriouſly debated in the ſenate, and ſolemnly ratified by the people. But when the arms of the legions were carried to a great diſtance from Italy, the generals aſſumed the liberty of direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them againſt whatever people, and in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever manner, they judged moſt advantageous for the public ſervice. It was from the ſucceſs, not from the juſtice, of their enterpriſes, that they expected the honours of a triumph. In the uſe of victory, eſpecially after they were no longer controlled by the commiſſioners of the ſenate, they exerciſed the moſt unbounded deſpotiſm. When Pompey commanded in the eaſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded his ſoldiers and allies, dethroned princes,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0034700101:125"/>
divided kingdoms, founded colonies, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the treaſures of Mithridates. On his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Rome, he obtained, by a ſingle act of the ſenate and people, the univerſal ratification of all his proceedings <note n="9" place="bottom">By the laviſh but unconſtrained ſuffrages of the people, Pompey had obtained a military command ſcarcely inferior to that of Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. Among the extraordinary acts of power executed by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, we may remark the foundation of twenty-nine cities, and the diſtribution of three or four millions ſterling to his troops. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of his acts met with ſome oppoſition and delays in the ſenate. See Plutarch, Appian, Dion Caſſius, and the firſt book of the epiſtles to Atticus.</note>. Such was the power over the ſoldiers, and over the enemies of Rome, which was either granted to, or aſſumed by, the generals of the republic. They were, at the ſame time, the governors, or rather monarchs, of the conquered provinces, united the civil with the military character, adminiſtered juſtice as well as the finances, and exerciſed both the executive and legiſlative power of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>From what has been already obſerved in the <note place="margin">Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> firſt chapter of this work, ſome notion may be formed of the armies and provinces thus intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ruling hand of Auguſtus. But as it was impoſſible that he could perſonally command the legions of ſo many diſtant frontiers, he was indulged by the ſenate, as Pompey had already been, in the permiſſion of devolving the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his great office on a ſufficient number of lieutenants. In rank and authority theſe officers ſeemed not inferior to the ancient proconſuls; but their ſtation was dependent and precarious. They received and held their commiſſions at
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0034700101:126"/>
the will of a ſuperior, to whoſe <hi>auſpicious</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the merit of their action was legally attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted <note n="10" place="bottom">Under the commonwealth, a triumph could only be claimed by the general, who was authoriſed to take the Auſpices in the name of the people. By an exact conſequence drawn from this principle of policy and religion, the triumph was reſerved to the emperor; and his moſt ſucceſsful lieutenants were ſatisfied with ſome marks of diſtinction, which, under the name of triumphal honours, were invented in their favour.</note>. They were the repreſentatives of the emperor. The emperor alone was the general of the republic, and his juriſdiction, civil as well as military, extended over all the conqueſts of Rome. It was ſome ſatisfaction, however, to the ſenate, that he always delegated his power to the members of their body. The Imperial lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants were of conſular or praetorian dignity; the legions were commanded by ſenators, and the praefecture of Egypt was the only important truſt committed to a Roman knight.</p>
            <p>Within ſix days after Auguſtus had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled <note place="margin">Diviſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the emperor and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> to accept ſo very liberal a grant, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to gratify the pride of the ſenate by an eaſy ſacrifice. He repreſented to them, that they had enlarged his powers, even beyond that degree which might be required by the melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the times. They had not permitted him to refuſe the laborious command of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and the frontiers; but he muſt inſiſt on being allowed to reſtore the more peaceful and ſecure provinces, to the mild adminiſtration of the civil magiſtrate. In the diviſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, Auguſtus provided for his own power,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0034700101:127"/>
and for the dignity of the republic. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſuls of the ſenate, particularly thoſe of Aſia, Greece, and Africa, enjoyed a more honourable character than the lieutenants of the emperor, who commanded in Gaul or Syria. The former were attended by lictors, the latter by ſoldiers. A law was paſſed, that wherever the emperor was preſent, his extraordinary commiſſion ſhould ſuperſede the ordinary juriſdiction of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; a cuſtom was introduced, that the new conqueſts belonged to the Imperial portion; and it was ſoon diſcovered, that the authority of the <hi>Prince,</hi> the favourite epithet of Auguſtus, was the ſame in every part of the empire.</p>
            <p>In return for this imaginary conceſſion, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus <note place="margin">The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his military command, and guards in Rome itſelf.</note> obtained an important privilege, which rendered him maſter of Rome and Italy. By a dangerous exception to the ancient maxims, he was authorized to preſerve his military command, ſupported by a numerous body of guards, even in time of peace, and in the heart of the capital. His command, indeed, was confined to thoſe citizens who were engaged in the ſervice by the military oath; but ſuch was the propenſity of the Romans to ſervitude, that the oath was volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily taken by the magiſtrates, the ſenators, and the equeſtrian order, till the homage of flattery was inſenſibly converted into an annual and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn proteſtation of fidelity.</p>
            <p>Although Auguſtus conſidered a military force <note place="margin">Conſular and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitian powers.</note> as the firmeſt foundation, he wiſely rejected it, as a very odious inſtrument of government. It was more agreeable to his temper, as well as to his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0034700101:128"/>
policy, to reign under the venerable names of ancient magiſtracy, and artfully to collect, in his own perſon, all the ſcattered rays of civil juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. With this view, he permitted the ſenate to confer upon him, for his life, the powers of the conſular <note n="11" place="bottom">Cicero (de Legibus, iii. 3.) gives the conſular office the name of <hi>Regia poteſtas:</hi> and Polybius (l. vi. c. 3.) obſerves three powers in the Roman conſtitution. The monarchical was repreſented and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by the Conſuls.</note> and tribunitian offices <note n="12" place="bottom">As the tribunitian power (diſtinct from the annual office) was firſt invented for the dictator Caeſar (Dion, l. xliv. p. 384.), we may eaſily conceive, that it was given as a reward for having ſo nobly aſſerted, by arms, the ſacred rights of the tribunes and people. See his own Commentaries, de Bell. Civil. l. i.</note>, which were, in the ſame manner, continued to all his ſucceſſors. The conſuls had ſucceeded to the kings of Rome, and repreſented the dignity of the ſtate. They ſuperintended the ceremonies of religion, levied and commanded the legions, gave audience to foreign ambaſſadors, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in the aſſemblies both of the ſenate and people. The general control of the finances was intruſted to their care; and though they ſeldom had leiſure to adminiſter juſtice in perſon, they were conſidered as the ſupreme guardians of law, equity, and the public peace. Such was their ordinary juriſdiction; but whenever the ſenate empowered the firſt magiſtrate to conſult the ſafety of the commonwealth, he was raiſed by that degree above the laws, and exerciſed, in the defence of liberty, a temporary deſpotiſm <note n="13" place="bottom">Auguſtus exerciſed nine annual conſulſhips without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He then moſt artfully refuſed that magiſtracy as well as the dictatorſhip, abſented himſelf from Rome, and waited till the fatal effects of tumult and faction forced the ſenate to inveſt him with a perpetual conſulſhip. Auguſtus, as well as his ſucceſſors, affected, however, to conceal ſo invidious a title.</note>.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0034700101:129"/>
The character of the tribunes was, in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, different from that of the conſuls. The appearance of the former was modeſt and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but their perſons were ſacred and inviolable. Their force was ſuited rather for oppoſition than for action. They were inſtituted to defend the oppreſſed, to pardon offences, to arraign the enemies of the people, and, when they judged it neceſſary, to ſtop, by a ſingle word, the whole machine of government. As long as the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſubſiſted, the dangerous influence, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conſul or the tribune might derive from their reſpective juriſdiction, was diminiſhed by ſeveral important reſtrictions. Their authority expired with the year in which they were elected; the former office was divided between two, the latter among ten perſons; and, as both in their private and public intereſt they were averſe to each other, their mutual conflicts contributed, for the moſt part, to ſtrengthen rather than to deſtroy the balance of the conſtitution. But when the conſular and tribunitian powers were united, when they were veſted for life in a ſingle perſon, when the general of the army was, at the ſame time, the miniſter of the ſenate and the repreſentative of the Roman people, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reſiſt the exerciſe, nor was it eaſy to define the limits, of his Imperial prerogative.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0034700101:130"/>
To theſe accumulated honours, the policy of Auguſtus ſoon added the ſplendid as well as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant dignities of ſupreme pontiff, and of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. <note place="margin">Imperial preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> By the former he acquired the management of the religion, and by the latter a legal inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over the manners and fortunes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man people. If ſo many diſtinct and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent powers did not exactly unite with each other, the complaiſance of the ſenate was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſupply every deficiency by the moſt ample and extraordinary conceſſions. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, as the firſt miniſters of the republic, were exempted from the obligation and penalty of many inconvenient laws: they were authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to convoke the ſenate, to make ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſame day, to recommend candidates for the honours of the ſtate, to enlarge the bounds of the city, to employ the revenue at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to declare peace and war, to ratify trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and by a moſt comprehenſive clauſe, they were empowered to execute whatſoever they ſhould judge advantageous to the empire, and agreeable to the majeſty of things private or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, human or divine <note n="14" place="bottom">See a fragment of a Decree of the Senate, conferring on the emperor Veſpaſian, all the powers granted to his predeceſſors, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, Tiberius, and Claudius.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0034700101:131"/>
forms of the ancient adminiſtration were preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Auguſtus with the moſt anxious care. The uſual number of conſuls, praetors, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes <note n="15" place="bottom">Two conſuls were created on the Calends of January; but in the courſe of the year others were ſubſtituted in their places, till the annual number ſeems to have amounted to no leſs than twelve. The praetors were uſually ſixteen or eighteen (Lipſius in Excurſ. D<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad Tacit. Annal. l. i.). I have not mentioned the Aediles or Quaeſtors. Officers of the police or revenue eaſily adapt themſelves to any form of government. In the time of Nero, the tribunes legally poſſeſſed the right of <hi>interceſſion,</hi> though it might be dangerous to exerciſe it (Tacit. Annal. xvi. 26.). In the time of Trajan, it was doubtful whether the tribuneſhip was an office or a name (Plin.

Thoſe honours ſtill attracted the vain ambition of the Romans; and the emperors themſelves, though inveſted for life with the powers of the conſulſhip, frequently aſpired to the title of that annual dignity, which they condeſcended to ſhare with the moſt illuſtrious of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens <note n="16" place="bottom">The tyrants themſelves were ambitious of the conſulſhip.

Trajan revived the ancient oath, and ſwore before the conſul's tribunal, that he would obſerve the laws (Plin. Panegyric. c. 64.).</note>. In the election of theſe magiſtrates, the people, during the reign of Auguſtus, were permitted to expoſe all the inconveniences of a wild democracy. That artful prince, inſtead of diſcovering the leaſt ſymptom of impatience, humbly ſolicited their ſuffrages for himſelf or his friends, and ſcrupulouſly practiſed all the duties

            <p>By declaring themſelves the protectors of the <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> people, Marius and Caeſar had ſubverted the conſtitution of their country. But as ſoon as the ſenate had been humbled and diſarmed, ſuch an aſſembly, conſiſting of five or ſix hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, was found a much more tractable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtrument of dominion. It was on the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the ſenate, that Auguſtus and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors founded their new empire; and they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, on every occaſion, to adopt the language and principles of Patricians. In the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own powers, they frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the great national council, and <hi>ſeemed</hi> to refer to its deciſion the moſt important concerns of peace and war.

it was the ſupreme court of appeal; with regard to criminal matters, a tribunal, conſtituted for the trial of all offences that were committed by men in any public ſtation, or that affected the peace and majeſty of the Roman people. The exerciſe of the judicial power became the moſt frequent and ſerious occupation of the ſenate; and the important cauſes that were pleaded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, afforded a laſt refuge to the ſpirit of ancient eloquence. As a council of ſtate, and as a court of juſtice, the ſenate poſſeſſed very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable prerogatives; but in its legiſlative ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, in which it was ſuppoſed virtually to repreſent the people, the rights of ſovereignty were acknowledged to reſide in that aſſembly. Every power was derived from their authority, every law was ratified by their ſanction. Their regular meetings were held on three ſtated days in every month, the Calends, the Nones, and the Ides. The debates were conducted with decent freedom; and the emperors themſelves, who gloried in the name of ſenators, ſat, voted, and divided with their equals.</p>

The Aſiatic <note place="margin">Deifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Greeks were the firſt inventors, the ſucceſſors of Alexander the firſt objects, of this ſervile and impious mode of adulation. It was eaſily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the kings to the governors of Aſia; and the Roman magiſtrates very frequently were adored as provincial deities, with the pomp of altars and temples, of feſtivals and ſacrifices <note n="22" place="bottom">See a diſſertation of the Abbé Mongault in the firſt volume of the Academy of Inſcriptions.</note>. It was natural that the emperors ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe what the proconſuls had accepted; and the divine honours which both the one and the other received from the provinces, atteſted rather the deſpotiſm than the ſervitude of Rome. But the conquerors ſoon imitated the vanquiſhed nations in the arts of flattery; and the imperious ſpirit of the firſt Caeſar too eaſily conſented to aſſume, during his life-time, a place among the tutelar deities of Rome. The milder temper of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor declined ſo dangerous an ambition, which was never afterwards revived, except by the madneſs of Caligula and Domitian. Auguſtus permitted indeed ſome of the provincial cities to erect temples to his honour, on condition that they ſhould aſſociate the worſhip of Rome with that of the ſovereign; he tolerated private ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,

of which he might be the object <note n="23" place="bottom">Jurandaſque tuum per nomen ponimus <hi>aras</hi> ſays Horace to the emperor himſelf, and Horace was well acquainted with the court of Auguſtus.</note>; but he contented himſelf with being revered by the ſenate and people in his human character, and wiſely left to his ſucceſſor, the care of his public deification. A regular cuſtom was introduced, that on the deceaſe of every emperor who had neither lived nor died like a tyrant, the ſenate by a ſolemn decree ſhould place him in the number of the gods: and the ceremonies of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſis were blended with thoſe of his funeral.

We ſhould diſgrace the virtues of the Antonines, by comparing them with the vices of Hercules or Jupiter. Even the character of Caeſar or Auguſtus were far ſuperior to thoſe of the popular deities. But it was the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the former to live in an enlightened age, and their actions were too faithfully recorded to admit of ſuch a mixture of fable and myſtery, as the devotion of the vulgar requires.

In the conſideration of the Imperial govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we have frequently mentioned the artful founder, under his well-known title of Auguſtus, <note place="margin">Titles of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </note> which was not however conferred upon him, till the edifice was almoſt completed. The obſcure name of Octavianus, he derived from a mean family, in the little town of Aricia. It was ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the blood of the proſcription; and he was deſirous, had it been poſſible, to eraſe all memory of his former life. The illuſtrious ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of Caeſar, he had aſſumed, as the adopted ſon of the dictator; but he had too much good ſenſe, either to hope to be confounded, or to wiſh to be compared, with that extraordinary man. It was propoſed in the ſenate, to dignify their miniſter with a new appellation: and after a very ſerious diſcuſſion, that of Auguſtus was choſen, among ſeveral others, as being the moſt expreſſive of the character of peace and ſanctity, which he uniformly affected <note n="25" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius, l. liii. p. 710. with the curious Annotations of Reymar.</note>. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was therefore a perſonal, <hi>Caeſar</hi> a family diſtinction. The former ſhould naturally have expired with the prince on whom it was beſtowed; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the latter was diffuſed by adoption and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male alliance, Nero was the laſt prince who could allege any hereditary claim to the honours of the Julian line. But, at the time of his death, the practice of a century had inſeparably connected thoſe appellations with the Imperial dignity, and they have been preſerved by a long ſucceſſion of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0034700101:138"/>
emperors, Romans, Greeks, Franks, and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, from the fall of the republic to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time. A diſtinction was, however, ſoon introduced. The ſacred title of Auguſtus was always reſerved for the monarch, whilſt the name of Caeſar was more freely communicated to his relations; and, from the reign of Hadrian, at leaſt, was appropriated to the ſecond perſon in the ſtate, who was conſidered as the preſumptive heir of the empire.</p>
            <p>The tender reſpect of Auguſtus for a free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution <note place="margin">Character and policy of Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> which he had deſtroyed, can only be explained by an attentive conſideration of the character of that ſubtle tyrant. A cool head, an unfeeling heart, and a cowardly diſpoſition, prompted him, at the age of nineteen, to aſſume the maſk of hypocriſy, which he never afterwards laid aſide. With the ſame hand, and probably with the ſame temper, he ſigned the proſcription of Cicero, and the pardon of Cinna. His vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and even his vices, were artificial; and according to the various dictates of his intereſt, he was at firſt the enemy, and at laſt the father, of the Roman world <note n="26" place="bottom">As Octavianus advanced to the banquet of the Caeſars, his colour changed like that of the Camelion; pale at firſt, then red, afterwards black, he at laſt aſſumed the mild livery of Venus and the graces (Caeſars, p. 309.). This image employed by Julian, in his ingenious fiction, is juſt and elegant; but when he conſiders this change of character as real, and aſcribes it to the power of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, he does too much honour to philoſophy, and to Octavianus.</note>. When he framed the artful ſyſtem of the Imperial authority, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration was inſpired by his fears. He wiſhed to

He had laviſhed wealth and honours on his adherents; but the moſt favoured friends of his uncle were in the number of the conſpirators. The fidelity of the legions might defend his authority againſt open rebellion; but their vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance could not ſecure his perſon from the dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a determined republican; and the Romans, who revered the memory of Brutus <note n="27" place="bottom">Two centuries after the eſtabliſhment of monarchy, the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Marcus Antoninus recommends the character of Brutus as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect model of Roman virtue.</note>, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud the imitation of his virtue. Caeſar had provoked his fate, as much by the oſtentation of his power, as by his power itſelf. The conſul or the tribune might have reigned in peace. The title of king had armed the Romans againſt his life. Auguſtus was ſenſible that mankind is governed by names; nor was he deceived in his expectation, that the ſenate and people would ſubmit to ſlavery, provided they were reſpectfully aſſured, that they ſtill enjoyed their ancient free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. A feeble ſenate and enervated people cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acquieſced in the pleaſing illuſion, as long as it was ſupported by the virtue, or even by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of the ſucceſſors of Auguſtus. It was a motive of ſelf-preſervation, not a principle of liberty, that animated the conſpirators againſt Caligula, Nero, and Domitian. They attacked
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0034700101:140"/>
the perſon of the tyrant, without aiming their blow at the authority of the emperor.</p>
            <p>There appears, indeed, <hi>one</hi> memorable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <note place="margin">Attempt of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate after the death of Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note> in which the ſenate, after ſeventy years of patience, made an ineffectual attempt to reaſſume its long forgotten rights.

But while they deliberated, the Praetorian guards had reſolved. The ſtupid Claudius, brother of Germanicus, was already in their camp, inveſted with the Imperial purple, and prepared to ſupport his election by arms. The dream of liberty was at an end; and the ſenate awoke to all the horrors of inevitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. Deſerted by the people, and threatened by a military force, that feeble aſſembly was compelled to ratify the choice of the Praetorians, and to embrace the benefit of an amneſty, which Claudius had the prudence to offer, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity to obſerve <note n="28" place="bottom">It is much to be regretted, that we have loſt the part of Tacitus, which treated of that tranſaction.

The inſolence of the armies inſpired Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus <note place="margin">Image of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the armies.</note> with fears of a ſtill more alarming nature. The deſpair of the citizens could only attempt, what the power of the ſoldiers was, at any time,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0034700101:141"/>
able to execute. How precarious was his own authority over men whom he had taught to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late every ſocial duty! He had heard their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious clamours; he dreaded their calmer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of reflection. One revolution had been purchaſed by immenſe rewards; but a ſecond revolution might double thoſe rewards. The troops profeſſed the fondeſt attachment to the houſe of Caeſar; but the attachments of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude are capricious and inconſtant. Auguſtus ſummoned to his aid, whatever remained in thoſe fierce minds, of Roman prejudices; enforced the rigour of diſcipline by the ſanction of law; and interpoſing the majeſty of the ſenate, between the emperor and the army, boldly claimed their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, as the firſt magiſtrate of the republic <note n="29" place="bottom">Auguſtus reſtored the ancient ſeverity of diſcipline. After the civil wars, he dropped the endearing name of Fellow-Soldiers, and called them only Soldiers (Sueton. in Auguſt. c. 25.).

            <p>During a long period of two hundred and <note place="margin">Their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> twenty years, from the eſtabliſhment of this art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſyſtem to the death of Commodus, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers inherent to a military government were, in a great meaſure, ſuſpended. The ſoldiers were ſeldom rouſed to that fatal ſenſe of their own ſtrength, and of the weakneſs of the civil autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which was, before and afterwards, produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of ſuch dreadful calamities. Caligula and Domitian were aſſaſſinated in their palace by their own domeſtics: the convulſions which agitated Rome on the death of the former, were confined to the walls of the city. But Nero involved the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0034700101:142"/>
whole empire in his ruin. In the ſpace of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months, four princes periſhed by the ſword; and the Roman world was ſhaken by the fury of the contending armies. Excepting only this ſhort, though violent, eruption of military li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, the two centuries from Auguſtus to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus paſſed away unſtained with civil blood, and undiſturbed by revolutions.

The legions reſpected their oath of fidelity; and it requires a minute inſpection of the Roman annals to diſcover three inconſiderable rebellions, which were all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in a few months, and without even the hazard of a battle <note n="31" place="bottom">The firſt was Camillus Scribonianus, who took up arms in Dalmatia againſt Claudius, and was deſerted by his own troops in five days. The ſecond, L. Antonius, in Germany, who rebelled againſt Domitian; and the third, Avidius Caſſius, in the reign of M. Antoninus. The two laſt reigned but a few months, and were cut off by their own adherents. We may obſerve, that both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus and Caſſius coloured their ambition with the deſign of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the republic; a taſk, ſaid Caſſius, peculiarly reſerved for his name and family.</note>.</p>
            <p>In elective monarchies, the vacancy of the <note place="margin">Deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſucceſſor.</note> throne is a moment big with danger and miſchief. The Roman emperors, deſirous to ſpare the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions that interval of ſuſpenſe, and the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of an irregular choice, inveſted their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ſucceſſor with ſo large a ſhare of preſent power, as ſhould enable him, after their deceaſe, to aſſume the remainder, without ſuffering the empire to perceive the change of maſters. Thus
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0034700101:143"/>
Auguſtus, after all his fairer proſpects had been ſnatched from him by untimely deaths, reſted his laſt hopes on Tiberius, obtained for his adopted <note place="margin">Of Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> ſon the cenſorial and tribunitian powers, and dictated a law, by which the future prince was inveſted with an authority equal to his own, over the provinces and the armies <note n="32" place="bottom">Velleius Paterculus, l. ii. c. 121. Sueton. in Tiber. c. 20.</note>. Thus Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian <note place="margin">Of Titus.</note> ſubdued the generous mind of his eldeſt ſon. Titus was adored by the eaſtern legions, which, under his command, had recently atchieved the conqueſt of Judaea. His power was dreaded, and, as his virtues were clouded by the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of youth, his deſigns were ſuſpected. Inſtead of liſtening to ſuch unworthy ſuſpicions, the prudent monarch aſſociated Titus to the full powers of the Imperial dignity; and the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſon ever approved himſelf the humble and faithful miniſter of ſo indulgent a father <note n="33" place="bottom">Sueton. in Tit. c. 6. Plin. in Praefat. Hiſt. Natur.</note>.</p>
            <p>The good ſenſe of Veſpaſian engaged him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <note place="margin">The race of the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars and the Flavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an family.</note> to embrace every meaſure that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his recent and precarious elevation. The military oath, and the fidelity of the troops, had been conſecrated, by the habits of an hundred years, to the name and family of the Caeſars: and although that family had been continued only by the fictitious rite of adoption, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſtill revered, in the perſon of Nero, the grandſon of Germanicus, and the lineal ſucceſſor of Auguſtus. It was not without reluctance and remorſe, that the Praetorian guards had been
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0034700101:144"/>
perſuaded to abandon the cauſe of the tyrant <note n="34" place="bottom">This idea is frequently and ſtrongly inculcated by Tacitus. See Hiſt. i. 5. 16. ii. 76.</note>. The rapid downfal of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, taught the armies to conſider the emperors as the creatures of <hi>their</hi> will, and the inſtruments of <hi>their</hi> licence. The birth of Veſpaſian was mean; his grandfather had been a private ſoldier, his father a petty officer of the revenue <note n="35" place="bottom">The emperor Veſpaſian, with his uſual good ſenſe, laughed at the Genealogiſts, who deduced his family from Flavius, the founder of Reate (his native country), and one of the companions of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.

Such a prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted his true intereſt by the aſſociation of a ſon, whoſe more ſplendid and amiable character might turn the public attention, from the obſcure ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, to the future glories of the Flavian houſe. Under the mild adminiſtration of Titus, the Roman world enjoyed a tranſient felicity, and his beloved memory ſerved to protect, above fifteen years, the vices of his brother Domitian.</p>
            <p>Nerva had ſcarcely accepted the purple from <note place="margin">A. D. 96.</note> the aſſaſſins of Domitian, before he diſcovered <note place="margin">Adoption and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Trajan.</note> that his feeble age was unable to ſtem the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of public diſorders, which had multiplied under the long tyranny of his predeceſſor. His mild diſpoſition was reſpected by the good; but the degenerate Romans required a more vigorous character, whoſe juſtice ſhould ſtrike terror into the guilty. Though he had ſeveral relations, he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0034700101:145"/>
fixed his choice on a ſtranger. He adopted Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan, then about forty years of age, and who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a powerful army in the Lower Germany; and immediately, by a decree of the ſenate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him his colleague and ſucceſſor in the empire <note n="36" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxviii. p. 1121. Plin. Secund. in Panegyric.</note>. It is ſincerely to be lamented, that <note place="margin">A.

There remains, however, one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric far removed beyond the ſuſpicion of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. Above two hundred and fifty years after the death of Trajan, the ſenate, in pouring out the cuſtomary acclamations on the acceſſion of a new emperor, wiſhed that he might ſurpaſs the felicity of Auguſtus, and the virtue of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan <note n="37" place="bottom">Felicior Auguſto, MELIOR TRAJANO. Eutrop. viii. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>We may readily believe, that the father of his <note place="margin">A. D. 117.</note> country heſitated whether he ought to intruſt the <note place="margin">Of Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> various and doubtful character of his kinſman Hadrian with ſovereign power. In his laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the arts of the empreſs Plotina either fixed the irreſolution of Trajan, or boldly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a fictitious adoption <note n="38" place="bottom">Dion (l. lxix. p. 1249.) affirms the whole to have been a fiction, on the authority of his father, who being governor of the province where Trajan died, had very good opportunities of ſifting this myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious tranſaction. Yet Dodwell (Praelect. Camden. xvii.) has maintained, that Hadrian was called to the certain hope of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, during the lifetime of Trajan.</note>; the truth of which could not be ſafely diſputed, and Hadrian was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0034700101:146"/>
peaceably acknowledged as his lawful ſucceſſor. Under his reign, as has been already mentioned, the empire flouriſhed in peace and proſperity. He encouraged the arts, reformed the laws, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted military diſcipline, and viſited all his provinces in perſon. His vaſt and active genius was equally ſuited to the moſt enlarged views, and the minute details of civil policy. But the ruling paſſions of his ſoul were curioſity and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. As they prevailed, and as they were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by different objects, Hadrian was, by turns, an excellent prince, a ridiculous ſophiſt, and a jealous tyrant. The general tenor of his conduct deſerved praiſe for its equity and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Yet in the firſt days of his reign, he put to death four conſular ſenators, his perſonal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and men who had been judged worthy of empire; and the tediouſneſs of a painful illneſs rendered him, at laſt, peeviſh and cruel. The ſenate doubted whether they ſhould pronounce him a god or a tyrant; and the honours decreed to his memory were granted to the prayers of the pious Antoninus <note n="39" place="bottom">Dion (l. lxx. p. 1171.). Aurel. Victor.</note>.</p>
            <p>The caprice of Hadrian influenced his choice <note place="margin">Adoption of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and younger Verus.</note> of a ſucceſſor. After revolving in his mind ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral men of diſtinguiſhed merit, whom he eſteemed and hated, he adopted Aelius Verus, a gay and voluptuous nobleman, recommended by uncommon beauty to the lover of Antinous <note n="40" place="bottom">The deification of Antinous, his medals, ſtatues, temples, city, oracles, and conſtellation, are well known, and ſtill diſhonour the memory of Hadrian. Yet we may remark, that of the firſt fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen emperors, Claudius was the only one whoſe taſte in love was entirely correct. For the honours of Antinous, ſee Spanheim, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaire ſur les Caeſars de Julien, p. 80.</note>.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0034700101:147"/>
But while Hadrian was delighting himſelf with his own applauſe, and the acclamations of the ſoldiers, whoſe conſent had been ſecured by an immenſe donative, the new Caeſar <note n="41" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 13. Aurelius Victor in Epitom.</note> was raviſhed from his embraces by an untimely death. He left only one ſon. Hadrian commended the boy to the gratitude of the Antonines. He was adopted by Pius; and, on the acceſſion of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, was inveſted with an equal ſhare of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power. Among the many vices of this younger Verus, he poſſeſſed one virtue; a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reverence for his wiſer colleague, to whom he willingly abandoned the ruder cares of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The philoſophic emperor diſſembled his follies, lamented his early death, and caſt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent veil over his memory.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Hadrian's paſſion was either grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <note place="margin">Adoption of the two Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines.</note> or diſappointed, he reſolved to deſerve the thanks of poſterity, by placing the moſt exalted merit on the Roman throne. His diſcerning eye eaſily diſcovered a ſenator about fifty years of age, blameleſs in all the offices of life, and a youth of about ſeventeen, whoſe riper years opened the fair proſpect of every virtue: the elder of theſe was declared the ſon and ſucceſſor of Hadrian, on condition, however, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould immediately adopt the younger. The two Antonines (for it is of them that we are now ſpeaking) governed the Roman world forty-two <note place="margin">A. D. 138.—180.</note>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0034700101:148"/>
years, with the ſame invariable ſpirit of wiſdom and virtue. Although Pius had two ſons <note n="42" place="bottom">Without the help of medals and inſcriptions, we ſhould be ignorant of this fact, ſo honourable to the memory of Pius.</note>, he preferred the welfare of Rome to the intereſt of his family, gave his daughter Fauſtina in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to young Marcus, obtained from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the tribunitian and proconſular powers, and with a noble diſdain, or rather ignorance of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, aſſociated him to all the labours of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Marcus, on the other hand, revered the character of his benefactor, loved him as a parent, obeyed him as his ſovereign <note n="43" place="bottom">During the twenty-three years of Pius's reign, Marcus was only two nights abſent from the palace, and even thoſe were at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times.

            <p>Titus Antoninus Pius has been juſtly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated <note place="margin">Character and reign of Pius.</note> a ſecond Numa. The ſame love of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, juſtice, and peace, was the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of both princes. But the ſituation of the latter opened a much larger field for the exerciſe of thoſe virtues. Numa could only prevent a few neighbouring villages from plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering each other's harveſts. Antoninus diffuſed order and tranquillity over the greateſt part of the earth. His reign is marked by the rare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of furniſhing very few materials for hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; which is, indeed, little more than the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0034700101:149"/>
regiſter of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind. In private life, he was an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as well as a good man. The native ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of his virtue was a ſtranger to vanity or affectation. He enjoyed with moderation, the conveniencies of his fortune, and the innocent pleaſures of ſociety <note n="44" place="bottom">He was fond of the theatre, and not inſenſible to the charms of the fair ſex.

Even Marcus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus has been called a hypocrite; but the wildeſt ſcepticiſm never inſinuated that Caeſar might poſſibly be a coward, or Tully a fool. Wit and valour are qualifications more eaſily aſcertained, than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity or the love of juſtice.</note>. It was the well-earned harveſt of many a learned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, of many a patient lecture, and many a midnight lucubration. At the age of twelve years he embraced the rigid ſyſtem of the Stoicks, which taught him to ſubmit his body to his mind, his paſſions to his reaſon; to conſider vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as the only good, vice as the only evil, all things external, as things indifferent <note n="46" place="bottom">Tacitus has characterized, in a few words, the principles of the portico: Doctores ſapientiae ſecutus eſt, qui ſola bona quae ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſta, mala tantum quae turpia; potentiam, nobilitatem, caeteraque extra animum, neque bonis neque malis adnumerant.

The vaſt extent of the Roman empire was governed by abſolute power, under the guidance of virtue and wiſdom. The armies were reſtrained by the firm but gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hand of four ſucceſſive emperors, whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and authority commanded involuntary reſpect. The forms of the civil adminiſtration were carefully preſerved by Nerva, Trajan, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian, and the Antonines, who delighted in the image of liberty, and were pleaſed with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves as the accountable miniſters of the laws.

A juſt, but melancholy reflection embittered, however, the nobleſt of human enjoyments. They muſt often have recollected the inſtability of a happineſs which depended on the character of a ſingle man. The fatal moment was perhaps approaching, when ſome licentious youth, or ſome jealous tyrant, would abuſe, to the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that abſolute power, which they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted for the benefit of their people. The ideal reſtraints of the ſenate and the laws might ſerve

The military force was a blind and irreſiſtible inſtrument of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and the corruption of Roman manners would always ſupply flatteres eager to applaud, and miniſters prepared to ſerve, the fear or the avarice, the luſt or the cruelty, of their maſters.</p>
            <p>Theſe gloomy apprehenſions had been already <note place="margin">Memory of Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, and Domitian.</note> juſtified by the experience of the Romans. The annals of the emperors exhibit a ſtrong and various picture of human nature, which we ſhould vainly ſeek among the mixed and doubtful characters of modern hiſtory. In the conduct of thoſe monarchs we may trace the utmoſt lines of vice and virtue; the moſt exalted perfection, and the meaneſt degeneracy of our own ſpecies. The golden age of Trajan and the Antonines had been preceded by an age of iron. It is almoſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to enumerate the unworthy ſucceſſors of Auguſtus. Their unparalleled vices, and the ſplendid theatre on which they were acted, have ſaved them from oblivion. The dark unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tiberius, the furious Caligula, the feeble Claudius, the profligate and cruel Nero, the beaſtly Vitellius <note n="50" place="bottom">Vitellius conſumed in mere eating, at leaſt ſix millions of our money, in about ſeven months.

During fourſcore years (excepting only the ſhort and doubtful reſpite of Veſpaſian's reign <note n="51" place="bottom">The execution of Helvidius Priſcus, and of the virtuous Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nina, diſgraced the reign of Veſpaſian.</note>) Rome groaned beneath an unremitting tyranny, which exterminated the ancient families of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and was fatal to almoſt every virtue, and every talent, that aroſe in that unhappy period.</p>
            <p>Under the reign of theſe monſters, the ſlavery <note place="margin">Peculiar miſery of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their tyrants.</note> of the Romans was accompanied with two pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar circumſtances, the one occaſioned by their former liberty, the other by their extenſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, which rendered their condition more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely wretched than that of the victims of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in any other age or country. From theſe cauſes were derived, 1. The exquiſite ſenſibility of the ſufferers; and, 2. the impoſſibility of eſcaping from the hand of the oppreſſor.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0034700101:154"/>
but the ſtroke of lightning or apoplexy might be equally fatal; and it was the part of a wiſe man, to forget the inevitable calamities of human life in the enjoyment of the fleeting hour. He was dignified with the appellation of the king's ſlave; had, perhaps, been purchaſed from obſcure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in a country which he had never known; and was trained up from his infancy in the ſevere diſcipline of the ſeraglio <note n="53" place="bottom">The practice of raiſing ſlaves to the great offices of ſtate is ſtill more common among the Turks than among the Perſians.

ſentiments, or at leaſt the ideas, of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born anceſtors. The education of Helvidius and Thraſea, of Tacitus and Pliny, was the ſame as that of Cato and Cicero. From Grecian phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, they had imbibed the juſteſt and moſt liberal notions of the dignity of human nature, and the origin of civil ſociety. The hiſtory of their own country had taught them to revere a free, a virtuous, and a victorious commonwealth; to abhor the ſucceſsful crimes of Caeſar and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus; and inwardly to deſpiſe thoſe tyrants whom they adored with the moſt abject flattery. As magiſtrates and ſenators, they were admitted into the great council, which had once dictated laws to the earth, whoſe name ſtill gave a ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the acts of the monarch, and whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was ſo often proſtituted to the vileſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of tyranny. Tiberius, and thoſe emperors who adopted his maxims, attempted to diſguiſe their murders by the formalities of juſtice, and perhaps enjoyed a ſecret pleaſure in rendering the ſenate their accomplice as well as their victim. By this aſſembly, the laſt of the Romans were condemned for imaginary crimes and real vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.

A modern tyrant, who ſhould find no reſiſtance either in his own breaſt, or in his people, would ſoon experience a gentle reſtraint from the example of his equals, the dread of preſent cenſure, the advice of his allies, and the apprehenſion of his enemies.

            <p>THE mildneſs of Marcus, which the rigid diſcipline of the Stoics was unable to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, formed, at the ſame time, the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <note place="margin">Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Marcus.</note> and the only defective, part of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His excellent underſtanding was often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the unſuſpecting goodneſs of his heart. Artful men, who ſtudy the paſſions of princes, and conceal their own, approached his perſon in the diſguiſe of philoſophic ſanctity, and acquired riches and honours by affecting to deſpiſe them <note n="1" place="bottom">See the complaints of Avidius Caſſius, Hiſt.

The Cupid of the ancients was, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, a very ſenſual deity; and the amours of an empreſs, as they exact on her ſide the plaineſt advances, are ſeldom ſuſceptible of much ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental delicacy. Marcus was the only man in the empire who ſeemed ignorant or inſenſible of the irregularities of Fauſtina; which, according to the prejudices of every age, reflected ſome diſgrace on the injured huſband. He promoted ſeveral of her lovers to poſts of honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <note n="3" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 34.</note>, and during a connexion of thirty years, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably gave her proofs of the moſt tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and of a reſpect which ended not with her life.

The monſtrous vices of the ſon have caſt a ſhade on the purity of the father's virtues. It has been objected to Marcus, that he ſacrificed <note place="margin">to his ſon Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> the happineſs of millions to a fond partiality for a worthleſs boy; and that he choſe a ſucceſſor in his own family, rather than in the republic. Nothing, however, was neglected by the anxious father, and by the men of virtue and learning whom he ſummoned to his aſſiſtance, to expand the narrow mind of young Commodus, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his growing vices, and to render him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the throne, for which he was deſigned. But the power of inſtruction is ſeldom of much efficacy, except in thoſe happy diſpoſitions where it is almoſt ſuperfluous. The diſtaſteful leſſon of a grave philoſopher was, in a moment, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated by the whiſper of a profligate favourite; and Marcus himſelf blaſted the fruits of this laboured education, by admitting his ſon, at the age of fourteen or fifteen, to a full participation of the Imperial power. He lived but four years afterwards; but he lived long enough to repent a raſh meaſure, which raiſed the impetuous youth above the reſtraint of reaſon and authority.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the crimes which diſturb the internal <note place="margin">Acceſſion of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> peace of ſociety, are produced by the reſtraints which the neceſſary, but unequal laws of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, have impoſed on the appetites of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by confining to a few the poſſeſſion of thoſe objects that are coveted by many. Of all our paſſions and appetites, the love of power is of the moſt imperious and unſociable nature, ſince the pride of one man requires the ſubmiſſion of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0034700101:162"/>
the multitude. In the tumult of civil diſcord, the laws of ſociety loſe their force, and their place is ſeldom ſupplied by thoſe of humanity. The ardor of contention, the pride of victory, the deſpair of ſucceſs, the memory of paſt injuries, and the fear of future dangers, all contribute to inflame the mind, and to ſilence the voice of pity. From ſuch motives almoſt every page of hiſtory has been ſtained with civil blood; but theſe motives will not account for the unprovok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cruelties of Commodus, who had nothing to wiſh, and every thing to enjoy. The beloved ſon of Marcus ſucceeded to his father, amidſt <note place="margin">A. D. 180.</note> the acclamations of the ſenate and armies <note n="6" place="bottom">Commodus was the firſt <hi>Porphyrogenetus</hi> (born ſince his father's acceſſion to the throne). By a new ſtrain of flattery, the Egyptian medals date by the years of his life; as if they were ſynonymous to thoſe of his reign. Tillemont, Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. ii. p. 752.</note>, and when he aſcended the throne, the happy youth ſaw round him neither competitor to remove, nor enemies to puniſh. In this calm elevated ſtation, it was ſurely natural, that he ſhould prefer the love of mankind to their deteſtation, the mild glories of his five predeceſſors, to the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious fate of Nero, and Domitian.</p>
            <p>Yet Commodus was not, as he has been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, <note place="margin">Character of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus.</note> a tiger born with an inſatiate thirſt of human blood, and capable, from his infancy, of the moſt inhuman actions <note n="7" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 46.</note>. Nature had formed him of a weak, rather than a wicked diſpoſition. His ſimplicity and timidity rendered him the ſlave of his attendants, who gradually corrupted his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0034700101:163"/>
mind. His cruelty, which at firſt obeyed the dictates of others, degenerated into habit, and at length became the ruling paſſion of his ſoul <note n="8" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius, l. lxxii. p. 1203.</note>.</p>
            <p>Upon the death of his father, Commodus <note place="margin">He returns to Rome.</note> found himſelf embarraſſed with the command of a great army, and the conduct of a difficult war againſt the Quadi and Marcomanni <note n="9" place="bottom">According to Tertullian (Apolog. c. 25.), he died at Sirmium. But the ſituation of Vindobona, or Vienna, where both the Victors place his death, is better adapted to the operations of the war againſt the Marcomanni and Quadi.</note>. The ſervile and profligate youths whom Marcus had baniſhed, ſoon regained their ſtation and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence about the new emperor. They exaggerated the hardſhips and dangers of a campaign in the wild countries beyond the Danube; and they aſſured the indolent prince, that the terror of his name and the arms of his lieutenants would be ſufficient to complete the conqueſt of the diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed barbarians; or to impoſe ſuch conditions, as were more advantageous than any conqueſt. By a dextrous application to his ſenſual appetites, they compared the tranquillity, the ſplendour, the refined pleaſures of Rome, with the tumult of a Pannonian camp, which afforded neither leiſure nor materials for luxury <note n="10" place="bottom">Herodian, l. i. p. 12.</note>. Commodus liſtened to the pleaſing advice; but whilſt he heſitated between his own inclination, and the awe which he ſtill retained for his father's counſellors, the ſummer inſenſibly elapſed, and his triumphal entry into the capital was deferred till the autumn. His graceful perſon <note n="11" place="bottom">Herodian, l. i. p. 16.</note>, popular addreſs, and imagined
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0034700101:164"/>
virtues, attracted the public favour; the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able peace which he had recently granted to the barbarians, diffuſed an univerſal joy <note n="12" place="bottom">This univerſal joy is well deſcribed (from the medals as well as hiſtorians) by Mr. Wotton, Hiſt. of Rome, p. 192, 193.</note>; his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to reviſit Rome was fondly aſcribed to the love of his country; and his diſſolute courſe of amuſements was faintly condemned in a prince of nineteen years of age.</p>
            <p>During the three firſt years of his reign, the forms, and even the ſpirit of the old adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were maintained by thoſe faithful counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, to whom Marcus had recommended his ſon, and for whoſe wiſdom and integrity Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus ſtill entertained a reluctant eſteem. The young prince and his profligate favourites revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all the licence of ſovereign power; but his hands were yet unſtained with blood; and he had even diſplayed a generoſity of ſentiment, which might perhaps have ripened into ſolid virtue <note n="13" place="bottom">Manilius, the confidential ſecretary of Avidius Caſſius, was diſcovered after he had lain concealed ſeveral years. The emperor nobly relieved the public anxiety by refuſing to ſee him, and burning his papers without opening them. Dion Caſſius, l. lxxii. p. 1209.</note>. A fatal incident decided his fluctuating character.</p>
            <p>One evening, as the emperor was returning to <note place="margin">Is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an aſſaſſin.</note> the palace through a dark and narrow portico in the amphitheatre <note n="14" place="bottom">See Maffei degli Amphitheatri, p. 126.</note>, an aſſaſſin, who waited his <note place="margin">A.

It had been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0034700101:165"/>
not in the ſtate, but within the walls of the palace. Lucilla, the emperor's ſiſter, and widow of Lucius Verus, impatient of the ſecond rank, and jealous of the reigning empreſs, had armed the murderer againſt her brother's life. She had not ventured to communicate the black deſign to her ſecond huſband Claudius Pompeianus, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator of diſtinguiſhed merit and unſhaken loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; but among the crowd of her lovers (for ſhe imitated the manners of Fauſtina) ſhe found men of deſperate fortunes and wild ambition, who were prepared to ſerve her more violent, as well as her tender paſſions. The conſpirators experienced the rigor of juſtice, and the abandoned princeſs was puniſhed, firſt with exile, and afterwards with death <note n="15" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxii. p. 1205. Herodian, l. i. p. 16. Hiſt. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. p. 46.</note>.</p>
            <p>But the words of the aſſaſſin ſunk deep into the <note place="margin">Hatred and cruelty of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſenate.</note> mind of Commodus, and left an indelible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of fear and hatred againſt the whole body of the ſenate. Thoſe whom he had dreaded as importunate miniſters, he now ſuſpected as ſecret enemies. The Delators, a race of men diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and almoſt extinguiſhed, under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reigns; again became formidable, as ſoon as they diſcovered that the emperor was deſirous of finding diſaffection and treaſon in the ſenate. That aſſembly, whom Marcus had ever conſidered as the great council of the nation, was compoſed of the moſt diſtinguiſhed of the Romans; and diſtinction of every kind ſoon became criminal.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0034700101:166"/>
The poſſeſſion of wealth ſtimulated the diligence of the informers; rigid virtue implied a tacit cenſure of the irregularities of Commodus; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervices implied a dangerous ſuperiority of merit; and the friendſhip of the father always enſured the averſion of the ſon. Suſpicion was equivalent to proof. Trial to condemnation. The execution of a conſiderable ſenator was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the death of all who might lament or revenge his fate; and when Commodus had once taſted human blood, he became incapable of pity or remorſe.</p>
            <p>Of theſe innocent victims of tyranny, none <note place="margin">The Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> died more lamented than the two brothers of the Quintilian family, Maximus and Condianus; whoſe fraternal love has ſaved their names from oblivion, and endeared their memory to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Their ſtudies and their occupations, their purſuits and their pleaſures, were ſtill the ſame. In the enjoyment of a great eſtate, they never admitted the idea of a ſeparate intereſt; ſome fragments are now extant of a treatiſe which they compoſed in common; and in every action of life it was obſerved, that their two bodies were animated by one ſoul. The Antonines, who valued their virtues, and delighted in their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, raiſed them, in the ſame year, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip: and Marcus afterwards intruſted to their joint care, the civil adminiſtration of Greece, and a great military command, in which they obtained a ſignal victory over the Germans.

            <p>The tyrant's rage, after having ſhed the nobleſt <note place="margin">The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennis.</note> blood of the ſenate, at length recoiled on the principal inſtrument of his cruelty. Whilſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus was immerſed in blood and luxury, he devolved the detail of the public buſineſs on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennis; a ſervile and ambitious miniſter, who had obtained his poſt by the murder of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, but who poſſeſſed a conſiderable ſhare of vigour and ability. By acts of extortion, and the forfeited eſtates of the nobles ſacrificed to his avarice, he had accumulated an immenſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The Praetorian guards were under his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command; and his ſon, who already diſcovered a military genius, was at the head of the Illyrian legions. Perennis aſpired to the empire; or what, in the eyes of Commodus, amounted to the ſame crime, he was capable of aſpiring to it, had he not been prevented, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, and put to death. The fall of a miniſter <note place="margin">A. D. 186.</note> is a very trifling incident in the general hiſtory of the empire; but it was haſtened by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary circumſtance, which proved how much the nerves of diſcipline were already relaxed. The legions of Britain, diſcontented with the adminiſtration of Perennis, formed a deputation of fifteen hundred ſelect men, with inſtructions to march to Rome, and lay their complaints before the emperor. Theſe military petitioners,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0034700101:168"/>
by their own determined behaviour, by inflaming the diviſions of the guards, by exaggerating the ſtrength of the Britiſh army, and by alarming the fears of Commodus, exacted and obtained the miniſter's death, as the only redreſs of their grievances <note n="17" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxii. p. 1210.

            <p>The negligence of the public adminiſtration <note place="margin">Revolt of Maternus.</note> was betrayed ſoon afterwards, by a new diſorder which aroſe from the ſmalleſt beginnings. A ſpirit of deſertion began to prevail among the troops; and the deſerters, inſtead of ſeeking their ſafety in flight or concealment, infeſted the highways. Maternus, a private ſoldier, of a daring boldneſs above his ſtation, collected theſe bands of robbers into a little army, ſet open the priſons, invited the ſlaves to aſſert their freedom, and plundered with impunity the rich and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs cities of Gaul and Spain. The gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the provinces, who had long been the ſpectators, and perhaps the partners, of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations, were, at length, rouſed from their ſupine indolence by the threatening commands of the emperor. Maternus found that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed, and foreſaw that he muſt be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered. A great effort of deſpair was his laſt reſource. He ordered his followers to diſperſe,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0034700101:169"/>
to paſs the Alps in ſmall parties and various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, and to aſſemble at Rome, during the licentious tumult of the feſtival of Cybele <note n="18" place="bottom">During the ſecond Punic war, the Romans imported from Aſia the worſhip of the mother of the gods. Her feſtival, the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia,</hi> began on the fourth of April, and laſted ſix days. The ſtreets were crowded with mad proceſſions, the theatres with ſpectators; and the public tables with unbidden gueſts. Order and police were ſuſpended, and pleaſure was the only ſerious buſineſs of the city. See Ovid. de Faſtis, l. iv. 189, &amp;c.</note>. To murder Commodus, and to aſcend the vacant throne, was the ambition of no vulgar robber. His meaſures were ſo ably concerted, that his concealed troops already filled the ſtreets of Rome.

As a ſlave he entered the Imperial palace, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf uſeful to his maſter's paſſions, and rapidly aſcended to the moſt exalted ſtation which a ſubject could enjoy. His influence over the mind of Commodus was much greater than that of his predeceſſor; for Cleander was devoid of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0034700101:170"/>
any ability or virtue which could inſpire the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror with envy or diſtruſt. Avarice was the reigning paſſion of his ſoul, and the great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <note place="margin">His ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and cruelty.</note> of his adminiſtration. The rank of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, of Patrician, of Senator, was expoſed to public ſale; and it would have been conſidered as diſaffection, if any one had refuſed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe theſe empty and diſgraceful honours with the greateſt part of his fortune <note n="21" place="bottom">One of theſe dear-bought promotions occaſioned a current bon mot, that Julius Solon was <hi>baniſhed</hi> into the ſenate.</note>. In the lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive provincial employments, the miniſter ſhared with the governor the ſpoils of the people.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0034700101:171"/>
flattered himſelf that the Romans, dazzled and amuſed by this apparent liberality, would be leſs affected by the bloody ſcenes which were daily exhibited; that they would forget the death of Byrrhus, a ſenator to whoſe ſuperior merit the late emperor had granted one of his daughters; and that they would forgive the execution of Arrius Antoninus, the laſt repreſentative of the name and virtues of the Antonines. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, with more integrity than prudence, had attempted to diſcloſe, to his brother-in-law, the true character of Cleander.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0034700101:173"/>
with redoubled violence againſt the gates of the palace, where Commodus lay, diſſolved in luxury, and alone unconſcious of the civil war. It was death to approach his perſon with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome news. He would have periſhed in this ſupine ſecurity, had not two women, his elder ſiſter Fadilla, and Marcia, the moſt favoured of his concubines, ventured to break into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

Commodus ſtarted from his dream of pleaſure, and commanded that the head of Cleander ſhould be thrown out to the people. The deſired ſpectacle inſtantly appeaſed the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult; and the ſon of Marcus might even yet have regained the affection and confidence of his ſubjects <note n="28" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius, l. lxxii. p. 1215.

            <p>But every ſentiment of virtue and humanity <note place="margin">Diſſolute pleaſures of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus.</note> was extinct in the mind of Commodus. Whilſt he thus abandoned the reins of empire to theſe unworthy favourites, he valued nothing in ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power, except the unbounded licence of indulging his ſenſual appetites. His hours were ſpent in a ſeraglio of three hundred beautiful women, and as many boys, of every rank, and of every province; and, wherever the arts of ſeduction proved ineffectual, the brutal lover had

The intervals of luſt were filled up with the baſeſt amuſements. The influence of a polite age, and the labour of <note place="margin">His igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and low ſports.</note> an attentive education, had never been able to infuſe into his rude and brutiſh mind, the leaſt tincture of learning; and he was the firſt of the Roman emperors totally devoid of taſte for the pleaſures of the underſtanding. Nero himſelf excelled, or affected to excel, in the elegant arts of muſic and poetry; nor ſhould we deſpiſe his purſuits, had he not converted the pleaſing relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a leiſure hour into the ſerious buſineſs and ambition of his life. But Commodus, from his earlieſt infancy, diſcovered an averſion to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was rational or liberal, and a fond attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the amuſements of the populace; the ſports of the circus and amphitheatre, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats of gladiators, and the hunting of wild beaſts. The maſters in every branch of learning, whom Marcus provided for his ſon, were heard with inattention and diſguſt; whilſt the Moors and Parthians, who taught him to dart the javelin and to ſhoot with the bow, found a diſciple who delighted in his application, and ſoon equalled

the moſt ſkilful of his inſtructors, in the ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the eye, and the dexterity of the hand.</p>
            <p>The ſervile crowd, whoſe fortune depended on <note place="margin">Hunting of wild beaſts.</note> their maſter's vices, applauded theſe ignoble pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits. The perfidious voice of flattery reminded him, that by exploits of the ſame nature, by the defeat of the Nemaean lion, and the ſlaughter of the wild boar of Erymanthus, the Grecian Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules had acquired a place among the gods, and an immortal memory among men. They only forgot to obſerve, that, in the firſt ages of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, when the fiercer animals often diſpute with man the poſſeſſion of an unſettled country, a ſucceſsful war againſt thoſe ſavages is one of the moſt innocent and beneficial labours of heroiſm. In the civilized ſtate of the Roman empire, the wild beaſts had long ſince retired from the face of man, and the neighbourhood of populous cities. To ſurpriſe them in their ſolitary haunts, and to tranſport them to Rome, that they might be ſlain in pomp by the hand of an emperor, was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe equally ridiculous for the prince, and oppreſſive for the people <note n="30" place="bottom">The African lions, when preſſed by hunger, infeſted the open villages and cultivated country; and they infeſted them with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The royal beaſt was reſerved for the pleaſures of the emperor and the capital; and the unfortunate peaſant, who killed one of them, though in his own defence, incurred a very heavy penalty. This extraordinary <hi>game-law</hi> was mitigated by Honorius, and finally repealed by Juſtinian. Codex Theodoſ. tom. v. p. 92, et Comment. Gothofred.</note>. Ignorant of theſe diſtinctions, Commodus eagerly embraced the glorious reſemblance, and ſtiled himſelf (as we

On the appointed day, the various motives of flattery, fear, and curioſity, attracted to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre an innumerable multitude of ſpectators; and ſome degree of applauſe was deſervedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the uncommon ſkill of the Imperial performer. Whether he aimed at the head or heart of the animal, the wound was alike cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and mortal. With arrows, whoſe point was ſhaped into the form of a creſcent, Commodus often intercepted the rapid career, and cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the long bony neck of the oſtrich <note n="33" place="bottom">The oſtrich's neck is three feet long, and compoſed of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen vertebrae.

Marcia, his favourite concubine, Eclectus his chamberlain, and Laetus his Praetorian praefect, alarmed by the fate of their companions and predeceſſors, reſolved to prevent the deſtruction which every hour hung over their heads, either from the mad caprice of the tyrant, or the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den indignation of the people. Marcia ſeized the occaſion of preſenting a draught of wine to her lover, after he had fatigued himſelf with hunting ſome wild beaſts. Commodus retired to ſleep; but whilſt he was labouring with the <note place="margin">Death of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> effects of poiſon and drunkenneſs, a robuſt youth, <note place="margin">A.

The body was ſecretly conveyed out of the palace, before the leaſt ſuſpicion was entertained in the city, or even in the court, of the emperor's death. Such was the fate of the ſon of Marcus, and ſo eaſy was it to deſtroy a hated tyrant, who, by the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial powers of government, had oppreſſed, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirteen years, ſo many millions of ſubjects,

They reſolved inſtantly to fill the vacant throne with an emperor, whoſe character would juſtify and maintain the action that had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. They fixed on Pertinax, praefect of the city, an ancient ſenator of conſular rank, whoſe conſpicuous merit had broke through the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his birth, and raiſed him to the firſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the ſtate. He had ſucceſſively governed moſt of the provinces of the empire; and in all his great employments, military as well as civil, he had uniformly diſtinguiſhed himſelf by the firmneſs, the prudence, and the integrity of his conduct <note n="45" place="bottom">Pertinax was a native of Alba Pompeia, in Piedmont, and ſon of a timber-merchant. The order of his employments (it is marked by Capitolinus) well deſerves to be ſet down, as expreſſive of the form of government and manners of the age. 1. He was a centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion. 2. Praefect of a cohort in Syria, in the Parthian war, and in Britain. 3. He obtained an <hi>Ala,</hi> or ſquadron of horſe, in Maeſia. 4. He was commiſſary of proviſions on the Aemilian way. 5. He commanded the fleet upon the Rhine. 6. He was procurator of Dacia, with a ſalary of about 1600l. a year. 7.

Inſtead of death, they offered him the throne of the Roman world. During ſome moments he diſtruſted their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aſſurances.

The guards were rather ſurpriſed than pleaſed with the ſuſpicious death of a prince, whoſe indulgence and liberality they alone had experienced; but the emergency of the occaſion, the authority of their praefect, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Pertinax, and the clamours of the people, obliged them to ſtifle their ſecret diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, to accept the donative promiſed of the new emperor, to ſwear allegiance to him, and with joyful acclamations and laurels in their hands to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0034700101:183"/>
conduct him to the ſenate-houſe, that the military conſent might be ratified by the civil authority.</p>
            <p>This important night was now far ſpent; with <note place="margin">and by the ſenate.</note> the dawn of day, and the commencement of the <note place="margin">A. D. 193. 1ſt Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</note> new year, the ſenators expected a ſummons to attend an ignominious ceremony. In ſpite of all remonſtrances, even of thoſe of his creatures, who yet preſerved any regard for prudence or decency, Commodus had reſolved to paſs the night in the gladiator's ſchool, and from thence to take poſſeſſion of the conſulſhip, in the habit and with the attendance of that infamous crew. On a ſudden, before the break of day, the ſenate was called together in the temple of Concord, to meet the guards, and to ratify the election of a new emperor. For a few minutes they ſat in ſilent ſuſpence, doubtful of their unexpected deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſuſpicious of the cruel artifices of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus; but when at length they were aſſured that the tyrant was no more, they reſigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all the tranſports of joy and indignation. Pertinax, who modeſtly repreſented the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his extraction, and pointed out ſeveral noble ſenators more deſerving than himſelf of the empire, was conſtrained by their dutiful violence to aſcend the throne, and received all the titles of Imperial power, confirmed by the moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere vows of fidelity.

The names of tyrant, of gladiator, of public enemy, reſounded in every corner of the houſe. They decreed in tumultuous votes, that his honours

ſhould be reverſed, his titles eraſed from the public monuments, his ſtatues thrown down, his body dragged with a hook into the ſtripping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room of the gladiators, to ſatiate the public fury; and they expreſſed ſome indignation againſt thoſe officious ſervants who had already preſumed to ſcreen his remains from the juſtice of the ſenate. But Pertinax could not refuſe thoſe laſt rites to the memory of Marcus, and the tears of his firſt protector Claudius Pompeianus, who lamented the cruel fate of his brother-in-law, and lamented ſtill more that he had deſerved it <note n="47" place="bottom">Capitolinus gives us the particulars of theſe tumultuary votes which were moved by one ſenator, and repeated, or rather chanted by the whole body.

The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of theſe decrees was however ſupported by the principles of the Imperial conſtitution.

Pertinax found a nobler way of condemning his predeceſſor's memory; by the contraſt of his own virtues, with the vices of Commodus. On <note place="margin">Virtues of Pertinax.</note> the day of his acceſſion, he reſigned over to his wife and ſon his whole private fortune; that they might have no pretence to ſolicit favours at the expence of the ſtate. He refuſed to flatter the vanity of the former with the title of Auguſta; or to corrupt the inexperienced youth of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the rank of Caeſar. Accurately diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between the duties of a parent and thoſe of a ſovereign, he educated his ſon with a ſevere ſimplicity, which, while it gave him no aſſured proſpect of the throne, might in time have rendered him worthy of it. In public, the behaviour of Pertinax was grave and affable. He lived with the virtuous part of the ſenate (and in a private ſtation, he had been acquainted with the true character of each individual), with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either pride or jealouſy; conſidered them as friends and companions, with whom he had ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dangers of the tyranny, and with whom he wiſhed to enjoy the ſecurity of the preſent time. He very frequently invited them to familiar entertainments, the frugality of which was ridiculed by thoſe, who remembered and regretted the luxurious prodigality of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus <note n="49" place="bottom">Dion (l. lxxiii. p. 1223.) ſpeaks of theſe entertainments, as a ſenator who had ſupped with the emperor.

To heal, as far as it was poſſible, the wounds inflicted by the hand of tyranny, was the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but melancholy, taſk of Pertinax. The <note place="margin">He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to reform the ſtate.</note> innocent victims, who yet ſurvived, were recalled from exile, releaſed from priſon, and reſtored to the full poſſeſſion of their honours and fortunes. The unburied bodies of murdered ſenators (for the cruelty of Commodus endeavoured to extend itſelf beyond death) were depoſited in the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres of their anceſtors; their memory was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and every conſolation was beſtowed on their ruined and afflicted families. Among theſe conſolations, one of the moſt grateful was the puniſhment of the Delators; the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of their maſter, of virtue, and of their country. Yet even in the inquiſition of theſe legal aſſaſſins, Pertinax proceeded with a ſteady temper, which gave every thing to juſtice, and nothing to popular prejudice and reſentment.</p>
            <p>The finances of the ſtate demanded the moſt <note place="margin">His regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</note> vigilant care of the emperor. Though every meaſure of injuſtice and extortion had been adopted, which could collect the property of the ſubject into the coffers of the prince; the rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of Commodus had been ſo very inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to his extravagance, that, upon his death, no more than eight thouſand pounds were found in the exhauſted treaſury <note n="50" place="bottom">

the new emperor had been obliged to promiſe to the Praetorian guards. Yet under theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed circumſtances, Pertinax had the generous firmneſs to remit all the oppreſſive taxes invented by Commodus, and to cancel all the unjuſt claims of the treaſury; declaring, in a decree of the ſenate, <q>that he was better ſatisfied to adminiſter a poor republic with innocence, than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire riches by the ways of tyranny and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</q> Oeconomy and induſtry he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the pure and genuine ſources of wealth; and from them he ſoon derived a copious ſupply for the public neceſſities.

At the ſame time that he obliged the worthleſs favourites of the tyrant to reſign a part of their ill-gotten wealth, he ſatisfied the juſt creditors of the ſtate, and unexpectedly diſcharged the long arrears of honeſt ſervices. He removed the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive reſtrictions which had been laid upon commerce, and granted all the uncultivated
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0034700101:188"/>
lands in Italy and the provinces, to thoſe who would improve them; with an exemption from tribute, during the term of ten years <note n="52" place="bottom">Though Capitolinus has picked up many idle tales of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life of Pertinax, he joins with Dion and Herodian in admiring his public conduct.</note>.</p>
            <p>Such an uniform conduct had already ſecured <note place="margin">and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</note> to Pertinax the nobleſt reward of a ſovereign, the love and eſteem of his people. Thoſe who remembered the virtues of Marcus were happy to contemplate in their new emperor the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of that bright original; and flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they ſhould long enjoy the benign influence of his adminiſtration. A haſty zeal to reform the corrupted ſtate, accompanied with leſs prudence than might have been expected from the years and experience of Pertinax, proved fatal to himſelf and to his country. His honeſt indiſcretion united againſt him the ſervile crowd, who found their private benefit in the public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and who preferred the favour of a tyrant to the inexorable equality of the laws <note n="53" place="bottom">Leges, rem ſurdam, inexorabilem eſſe.

            <p>Amidſt the general joy, the ſullen and angry <note place="margin">Diſcontent of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians.</note> countenance of the Praetorian guards betrayed their inward diſſatisfaction. They had reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly ſubmitted to Pertinax; they dreaded the ſtrictneſs of the ancient diſcipline, which he was preparing to reſtore; and they regretted the licence of the former reign. Their diſcontents were ſecretly ſomented by Laetus their praefect, who found, when it was too late, that his new emperor would reward a ſervant, but would not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0034700101:189"/>
be ruled by a favourite. On the third day of his reign the ſoldiers ſeized on a noble ſenator, with a deſign to carry him to the camp, and to inveſt him with the Imperial purple. Inſtead of being dazzled by the dangerous honour, the affrighted victim eſcaped from their violence, and took re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge at the feet of Pertinax.

Falco was on the point of being juſtly condemned to death as a public enemy, had he not been ſaved by the earneſt and ſincere entreaties of the injured emperor; who conjured the ſenate, that the purity of his reign might not be ſtained by the blood even of a guilty ſenator.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſappointments ſerved only to irritate <note place="margin">Murder of Pertinax by the Praetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> the rage of the Praetorian guards. On the twenty-eighth of March, eighty-ſix days only after the death of Commodus, a general ſedition <note place="margin">A. D. 193.

Two or three hundred of the moſt deſperate ſoldiers march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at noon-day, with arms in their hands and fury in their looks, towards the Imperial palace. The gates were thrown open by their companions upon
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0034700101:190"/>
guard; and by the domeſtics of the old court, who had already formed a ſecret conſpiracy againſt the life of the too virtuous emperor. On the news of their approach, Pertinax, diſdaining either flight or concealment, advanced to meet his aſſaſſins; and recalled to their minds his own innocence, and the ſanctity of their recent oath. For a few moments they ſtood in ſilent ſuſpenſe, aſhamed of their atrocious deſign, and awed by the venerable aſpect and majeſtic firmneſs of their ſovereign, till at length the deſpair of pardon reviving their fury, a barbarian of the country of Tongres <note n="55" place="bottom">The modern biſhopric of Liege.

            <p>THE power of the ſword is more ſenſibly felt in an extenſive monarchy, than in a ſmall community. It has been calculated by the <note place="margin">Proportion of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary force, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the people.</note> ableſt politicians, that no ſtate, without being ſoon exhauſted, can maintain above the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part of its members in arms and idleneſs. But although this relative proportion may be uniform, the influence of the army over the reſt of the ſociety will vary according to the degree of its poſitive ſtrength. The advantages of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſcience and diſcipline cannot be exerted, unleſs a proper number of ſoldiers are united into one body, and actuated by one ſoul. With a handful of men, ſuch an union would be ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; with an unwieldy hoſt, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable; and the powers of the machine would be alike deſtroyed by the extreme mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs, or the exceſſive weight, of its ſprings. To illuſtrate this obſervation we need only reflect, that there is no ſuperiority of natural ſtrength, artificial weapons, or acquired ſkill, which could
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0034700101:192"/>
enable one man to keep in conſtant ſubjection one hundred of his fellow-creatures: the tyrant of a ſingle town, or a ſmall diſtrict, would ſoon diſcover that an hundred armed followers were a weak defence againſt ten thouſand peaſants or citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; but an hundred thouſand well-diſciplined ſoldiers will command, with deſpotic ſway, ten millions of ſubjects; and a body of ten or fifteen thouſand guards will ſtrike terror into the moſt numerous populace that ever crowded the ſtreets of an immenſe capital.</p>
            <p>The Praetorian bands, whoſe licentious fury <note place="margin">The Praetorian guards.</note> was the firſt ſymptom and cauſe of the decline of the Roman empire, ſcarcely amounted to the laſt mentioned number <note n="1" place="bottom">They were originally nine or ten thouſand men (for Tacitus and Dion are not agreed upon the ſubject), divided into as many cohorts. Vitellius increaſed them to ſixteen thouſand, and as far as we can learn from inſcriptions, they never afterwards ſunk much below that number. See Lipſius de magnitudine Romanâ, i. 4.</note>. They derived their inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution <note place="margin">Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</note> from Auguſtus. That crafty tyrant, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that laws might colour, but that arms alone could maintain, his uſurped dominion, had gradually formed this powerful body of guards in conſtant readineſs to protect his perſon, to awe the ſenate, and either to prevent or to cruſh the firſt motions of rebellion. He diſtinguiſhed theſe favoured troops by a double pay, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior privileges; but, as their formidable aſpect would at once have alarmed and irritated the Roman people, three cohorts only were ſtationed in the capital; whilſt the remainder was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed

But after fifty years of peace and ſervitude, Tiberius ventured on a deciſive meaſure, which for ever <note place="margin">Their camp.</note> rivetted the fetters of his country. Under the fair pretences of relieving Italy from the heavy burthen of military quarters, and of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a ſtricter diſcipline among the guards, he aſſembled them at Rome, in a permanent camp <note n="3" place="bottom">Tacit.

            <p>Such formidable ſervants are always neceſſary, <note place="margin">Their ſtrength and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</note> but often fatal to the throne of deſpotiſm. By thus introducing the Praetorian guards as it were into the palace and the ſenate, the emperors taught them to perceive their own ſtrength, and the weakneſs of the civil government; to view the vices of their maſters with familiar contempt, and to lay aſide that reverential awe, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance only, and myſtery, can preſerve, towards an imaginary power. In the luxurious idleneſs of an opulent city, their pride was nouriſhed by the ſenſe of their irreſiſtible weight; nor was it poſſible to conceal from them, that the perſon of the ſovereign, the authority of the ſenate, the public treaſure, and the ſeat of empire, were all

in their hands. To divert the Praetorian bands from theſe dangerous reflections, the firmeſt and beſt eſtabliſhed princes were obliged to mix blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments with commands, rewards with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to flatter their pride, indulge their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, connive at their irregularities, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their precarious faith by a liberal donative; which, ſince the elevation of Claudius, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted as a legal claim, on the acceſſion of every new emperor <note n="6" place="bottom">Claudius, raiſed by the ſoldiers to the empire, was the firſt who gave a donative.

            <p>The Praetorians had violated the ſanctity of <note place="margin">They offer the empire to ſale.</note> the throne, by the atrocious murder of Pertinax; they diſhonoured the majeſty of it, by their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent conduct. The camp was without a leader, for even the praefect Laetus, who had excited the tempeſt, prudently declined the public indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Amidſt the wild diſorder Sulpicianus, the emperor's father-in-law, and governor of the city, who had been ſent to the camp on the firſt alarm of mutiny, was endeavouring to calm the fury of the multitude, when he was ſilenced by the clamorous return of the murderers, bearing on a lance the head of Pertinax. Though hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory has accuſtomed us to obſerve every principle and every paſſion yielding to the imperious dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of ambition, it is ſcarcely credible that, in theſe moments of horror, Sulpicianus ſhould have aſpired to aſcend a throne polluted with the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0034700101:196"/>
recent blood of ſo near a relation, and ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a prince. He had already begun to uſe the only effectual argument, and to treat for the Imperial dignity; but the more prudent of the Praetorians, apprehenſive that, in this private contract, they ſhould not obtain a juſt price for ſo valuable a commodity, ran out upon the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts; and, with a loud voice, proclaimed that the Roman world was to be diſpoſed of to the beſt bidder by public auction <note n="10" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxiii. p. 1234.

            <p>This infamous offer, the moſt inſolent exceſs <note place="margin">It is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Julian,</note> of military licence, diffuſed an univerſal grief, ſhame, and indignation throughout the city. It <note place="margin">A. D. 193. March 28th.</note> reached at length the ears of Didius Julianus, a wealthy ſenator, who, regardleſs of the public calamities, was indulging himſelf in the luxury of the table <note n="11" place="bottom">Spartianus ſoftens the moſt odious parts of the character and elevation of Julian.</note>. His wife and his daughter, his freedmen and his paraſites, eaſily convinced him that he deſerved the throne, and earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him to embrace ſo fortunate an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. The vain old man haſtened to the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian camp, where Sulpicianus was ſtill in treaty with the guards; and began to bid againſt him from the foot of the rampart. The unworthy negociation was tranſacted by faithful emiſſaries, who paſſed alternately from one candidate to the other, and acquainted each of them with the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0034700101:197"/>
offers of his rival. Sulpicianus had already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a donative of five thouſand drachms (above one hundred and ſixty pounds) to each ſoldier; when Julian, eager for the prize, roſe at once to the ſum of ſix thouſand two hundred and fifty drachms, or upwards of two hundred pounds ſterling. The gates of the camp were inſtantly thrown open to the purchaſer; he was declared emperor, and received an oath of allegiance from the ſoldiers, who retained humanity enough to ſtipulate that he ſhould pardon and forget the competition of Sulpicianus.</p>
            <p>It was now incumbent on the Praetorians to <note place="margin">Julian is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the ſenate.</note> fulfil the conditions of the ſale. They placed their new ſovereign, whom they ſerved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, in the centre of their ranks, ſurrounded him on every ſide with their ſhields, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him in cloſe order of battle through the deſerted ſtreets of the city. The ſenate was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to aſſemble; and thoſe who had been the diſtinguiſhed friends of Pertinax, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal enemies of Julian, found it neceſſary to affect a more than common ſhare of ſatisfaction at this happy revolution <note n="12" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius, at that time praetor, had been a perſonal enemy to Julian, l. lxxiii. p. 1235.</note>. After Julian had filled the ſenate-houſe with armed ſoldiers, he expatiated on the freedom of his election, his own eminent virtues, and his full aſſurance of the affections of the ſenate. The obſequious aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly congratulated their own and the public feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; engaged their allegiance, and conferred on him all the ſeveral branches of the Imperial

We learn from thence one curious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that the new emperor, whatever had been his birth, was immediately aggregated to the number of Patrician families.</note>. From the ſenate Julian was conducted, by the ſame military proceſſion, to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the palace. The firſt objects that ſtruck <note place="margin">Takes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the palace.</note> his eyes, were the abandoned trunk of Pertinax, and the frugal entertainment prepared for his ſupper.

A magnificent feaſt was prepared by his order, and he amuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf till a very late hour, with dice, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of Pylades, a celebrated dancer. Yet it was obſerved, that after the crowd of flatterers diſperſed, and left him to darkneſs, ſolitude, and terrible reflection, he paſſed a ſleepleſs night; revolving moſt probably in his mind his own raſh folly, the fate of his virtuous predeceſſor, and the doubtful and dangerous tenure of an empire, which had not been acquired by merit, but purchaſed by money <note n="14" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxiii. p. 1235.

            <p>He had reaſon to tremble. On the throne of <note place="margin">The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> the world he found himſelf without a friend, and even without an adherent. The guards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were aſhamed of the prince whom their avarice had perſuaded them to accept; nor was there a citizen who did not conſider his elevation with horror, as the laſt inſult on the Roman name. The nobility, whoſe conſpicuous ſtation and ample poſſeſſions exacted the ſtricteſt caution, diſſembled their ſentiments, and met the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0034700101:199"/>
civility of the emperor with ſmiles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, and profeſſions of duty. But the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſecure in their numbers and obſcurity, gave a free vent to their paſſions. The ſtreets and public places of Rome reſounded with clamours and imprecations. The enraged multitude af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted the perſon of Julian, rejected his libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and conſcious of the impotence of their own reſentment, they called aloud on the legions of the frontiers to aſſert the violated majeſty of the Roman empire.</p>
            <p>The public diſcontent was ſoon diffuſed from <note place="margin">The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Britain, Syria, and Pannonia declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</note> the centre to the frontiers of the empire. The armies of Britain, of Syria, and of Illyricum, lamented the death of Pertinax, in whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or under whoſe command, they had ſo often fought and conquered. They received with ſurpriſe, with indignation, and perhaps with envy, the extraordinary intelligence, that the Praetorians had diſpoſed of the empire by public auction; and they ſternly refuſed to ratify the ignominious bargain. Their immediate and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous revolt was fatal to Julian, but it was fatal at the ſame time to the public peace; as the generals of the reſpective armies, Clodius Albinus, Peſcennius Niger, and Septimius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus, were ſtill more anxious to ſucceed than to revenge the murdered Pertinax. Their forces were exactly balanced. Each of them was at the head of three legions <note n="15" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxiii. p. 1235.</note>, with a numerous train of auxiliaries; and however different in their
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0034700101:200"/>
characters, they were all ſoldiers of experience and capacity.</p>
            <p>Clodius Albinus, governor of Britain, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed <note place="margin">Clodius Albinus in Britain.</note> both his competitors in the nobility of his extraction, which he derived from ſome of the moſt illuſtrious names of the old republic <note n="16" place="bottom">The Poſthumian and the Cejonian; the former of whom was raiſed to the conſulſhip in the fifth year after its inſtitution.</note>. But the branch from whence he claimed his deſcent, was ſunk into mean circumſtances, and tranſplanted into a remote province. It is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to form a juſt idea of his true character. Under the philoſophic cloak of auſterity, he ſtands accuſed of concealing moſt of the vices which degrade human nature <note n="17" place="bottom">Spartianus, in his undigeſted collections, mixes up all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and all the vices that enter into the human compoſition, and beſtows them on the ſame object. Such, indeed, are many of the characters in the Auguſtan Hiſtory.</note>. But his accuſers are thoſe venal writers who adored the fortune of Severus, and trampled on the aſhes of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful rival. Virtue, or the appearances of virtue, recommended Albinus to the confidence and good opinion of Marcus; and his preſerving with the ſon the ſame intereſt which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired with the father, is a proof at leaſt that he was poſſeſſed of a very flexible diſpoſition. The favour of a tyrant does not always ſuppoſe a want of merit in the object of it; he may, without intending it, reward a man of worth and ability, or he may find ſuch a man uſeful to his own ſervice. It does not appear that Albinus ſerved the ſon of Marcus, either as the miniſter of his cruelties, or even as the aſſociate of his pleaſures.

He was employed in a diſtant honourable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, when he received a confidential letter from the emperor, acquainting him of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable deſigns of ſome diſcontented generals, and authorizing him to declare himſelf the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and ſucceſſor of the throne, by aſſuming the title and enſigns of Caeſar <note n="18" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 80. 84.</note>. The governor of Britain wiſely declined the dangerous honour, which would have marked him for the jealouſy, or involved him in the approaching ruin, of Commodus. He courted power by nobler, or, at leaſt, by more ſpecious arts. On a premature report of the death of the emperor, he aſſembled his troops; and, in an eloquent diſcourſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the inevitable miſchiefs of deſpotiſm, deſcribed the happineſs and glory which their anceſtors had enjoyed under the conſular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and declared his firm reſolution to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate the ſenate and people in their legal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This popular harangue was anſwered by the loud acclamations of the Britiſh legions, and received at Rome with a ſecret murmur of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.

the uſurpation of Julian. The convulſions of the capital added new weight to his ſentiments, or rather to his profeſſions of patriotiſm. A regard to decency induced him to decline the lofty titles of Auguſtus and Emperor; and he imitated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the example of Galba, who, on a ſimilar occaſion, had ſtyled himſelf the Lieutenant of the ſenate and people <note n="20" place="bottom">Sueton. in Galb. c. 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>Perſonal merit alone had raiſed Peſcennius <note place="margin">Peſcennius Niger in Syria.</note> Niger from an obſcure birth and ſtation, to the government of Syria; a lucrative and important command, which in times of civil confuſion gave him a near proſpect of the throne. Yet his parts ſeem to have been better ſuited to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond than to the firſt rank; he was an unequal rival, though he might have approved himſelf an excellent lieutenant, to Severus, who afterwards diſplayed the greatneſs of his mind by adopting ſeveral uſeful inſtitutions from a vanquiſhed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <note n="21" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 76.</note>. In his government, Niger acquired the eſteem of the ſoldiers, and the love of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials. His rigid diſcipline fortified the valour and confirmed the obedience of the former, whilſt the voluptuous Syrians were leſs delighted with the mild firmneſs of his adminiſtration, than with the affability of his manners, and the apparent pleaſure with which he attended their frequent and pompous feſtivals <note n="22" place="bottom">Herod. l. ii. p. 68.

The country of Pannonia and Dalmatia, which occupied the ſpace between the Danube and the Hadriatic, was one of the laſt and moſt difficult <note place="margin">Pannonia and Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia.</note> conqueſts of the Romans. In the defence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional freedom, two hundred thouſand of theſe barbarians had once appeared in the field, alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the declining age of Auguſtus, and exerciſed the vigilant prudence of Tiberius at the head of the collected force of the empire <note n="26" place="bottom">See an account of that memorable war in Velleius Paterculus, ii. 110, &amp;c. who ſerved in the army of Tiberius.</note>. The Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonians yielded at length to the arms and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Rome. Their recent ſubjection, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the neighbourhood, and even the mixture, of the unconquered tribes, and perhaps the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, adapted, as it has been obſerved, to the production of great bodies and ſlow minds <note n="27" place="bottom">Such is the reflection of Herodian, l. ii. p. 74.

On the firſt news of the murder of Pertinax, he aſſembled his troops, painted in the moſt lively colours the crime, the inſolence, and the weakneſs of the Praetorian guards, and animated the legions to arms and to revenge. He concluded (and the peroration was thought extremely eloquent) with promiſing every ſoldier about four hundred pounds; an honourable donative, double in value to the infamous bribe with which Julian had purchaſed the empire <note n="29" place="bottom">Pannonia was too poor to ſupply ſuch a ſum.

The acclamations of <note place="margin">declared emperor by the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonian le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</note> the army immediately ſaluted Severus with the names of Auguſtus; Pertinax, and Emperor; and he thus attained the lofty ſtation to which <note place="margin">A.

Severus was declared emperor on the banks of the Danube, either at Carnuntum, according to Spartianus (Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 65.), or elſe at Sabaria, according to Victor. Mr. Hume, in ſuppoſing that the birth and dignity of Severus were too much inferior to the Imperial crown, and that he marched in Italy as general only, has not conſidered this tranſaction with his uſual accuracy (Eſſay on the original contract).</note>.</p>
            <p>The new candidate for empire ſaw and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the peculiar advantage of his ſituation. His province extended to the Julian Alps, which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0034700101:206"/>
gave an eaſy acceſs into Italy; and he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the ſaying of Auguſtus, That a Pannonian army might in ten days appear in ſight of Rome <note n="31" place="bottom">Velleius Paterculus, l. ii. c. 3. We muſt reckon the march from the neareſt verge of Pannonia, and extend the ſight of the city as far as two hundred miles.</note>. By a celerity proportioned to the greatneſs of <note place="margin">Marches into Italy.</note> the occaſion, he might reaſonably hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge Pertinax, puniſh Julian, and receive the homage of the ſenate and people, as their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful emperor, before his competitors, ſeparated from Italy by an immenſe tract of ſea and land, were apprized of his ſucceſs, or even of his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. During the whole expedition he ſcarcely allowed himſelf any moments for ſleep or food; marching on foot, and in complete armour, at the head of his columns, he inſinuated himſelf into the confidence and affection of his troops, preſſed their diligence, revived their ſpirits, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated their hopes, and was well ſatisfied to ſhare the hardſhips of the meaneſt ſoldier, whilſt he kept in view the infinite ſuperiority of his reward.</p>
            <p>The wretched Julian had expected, and thought <note place="margin">Advances towards Rome.</note> himſelf prepared, to diſpute the empire with the governor of Syria; but in the invincible and rapid approach of the Pannonian legions, he ſaw his inevitable ruin. The haſty arrival of every meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger increaſed his juſt apprehenſions. He was ſucceſſively informed, that Severus had paſſed the Alps; that the Italian cities, unwilling or unable to oppoſe his progreſs, had received him with the warmeſt profeſſions of joy and duty; that the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0034700101:207"/>
important place of Ravenna had ſurrendered without reſiſtance, and that the Hadriatic fleet was in the hands of the conqueror. The enemy was now within two hundred and fifty miles of Rome; and every moment diminiſhed the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſpan of life and empire allotted to Julian.</p>
            <p>He attempted, however, to prevent, or at leaſt <note place="margin">Diſtreſs of Julian.</note> to protract, his ruin. He implored the venal faith of the Praetorians, filled the city with una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing preparations for war, drew lines round the ſuburbs, and even ſtrengthened the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the palace; as if thoſe laſt intrenchments could be defended without hope of relief againſt a victorious invader. Fear and ſhame prevented the guards from deſerting his ſtandard; but they trembled at the name of the Pannonian legions, commanded by an experienced general, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to vanquiſh the barbarians on the frozen Danube <note n="32" place="bottom">This is not a puerile figure of rhetoric, but an alluſion to a real fact recorded by Dion, l. lxxi. p. 1181. It probably happened more than once.</note>. They quitted, with a ſigh, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the baths and theatres, to put on arms, whoſe uſe they had almoſt forgotten, and beneath the weight of which they were oppreſſed. The unpractiſed elephants, whoſe uncouth appearance, it was hoped, would ſtrike terror into the army of the north, threw their unſkilful riders; and the awkward evolutions of the marines, drawn from the fleet of Miſenum, were an object of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule to the populace; whilſt the ſenate enjoyed,

He ſent public ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of conſular rank to negociate with his rival; he diſpatched private aſſaſſins to take away his life. He deſigned that the Veſtal virgins, and all the colleges of prieſts, in their ſacerdotal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and bearing before them the ſacred pledges of the Roman religion, ſhould advance, in ſolemn proceſſion, to meet the Pannonian legions; and, at the ſame time, he vainly tried to interrogate, or to appeaſe, the fates, by magic ceremonies, and unlawful ſacrifices <note n="34" place="bottom">Hiſt.

            <p>Severus, who dreaded neither his arms nor his <note place="margin">Is deſerted by the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians.</note> enchantments, guarded himſelf from the only danger of ſecret conſpiracy, by the faithful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of ſix hundred choſen men, who never quitted his perſon or their cuiraſſes, either by night or by day, during the whole march.

Rome. His victory was already ſecure; but the deſpair of the Praetorians might have rendered it bloody; and Severus had the laudable ambition of aſcending the throne without drawing the ſword <note n="35" place="bottom">Victor and Eutropius, viii. 17. mention a combat near the Milvian bridge, the Ponte Molle, unknown to the better and more ancient writers.</note>.

            <p>The firſt cares of Severus were beſtowed on <note place="margin">Diſgrace of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian guards.</note> two meaſures, the one dictated by policy, the other by decency; the revenge, and the honours, due to the memory of Pertinax. Before the new emperor entered Rome, he iſſued his commands to the Praetorian guards, directing them to wait his arrival on a large plain near the city, without arms, but in the habits of ceremony, in which they were accuſtomed to attend their ſovereign. He was obeyed by thoſe haughty troops, whoſe contrition was the effect of their juſt terrors. A choſen part, of the Illyrian army encompaſſed them with levelled ſpears. Incapable of flight or reſiſtance, they expected their fate in ſilent conſternation. Severus mounted the tribunal, ſternly reproached them with perfidy and cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, diſmiſſed them with ignominy from the truſt which they had betrayed, deſpoiled them of their ſplendid ornaments, and baniſhed them, on pain of death, to the diſtance of an hundred miles from the capital.

            <p>The funeral and conſecration of Pertinax was <note place="margin">Funeral and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſis of Pertinax.</note> next ſolemnized with every circumſtances of ſad magnificence <note n="39" place="bottom">Dion (l. lxxiv. p. 1244.), who aſſiſted at the ceremony as a ſenator, gives a moſt pompous deſcription of it.</note>. The ſenate, with a melancholy pleaſure, performed the laſt rites to that excellent prince, whom they had loved, and ſtill regretted. The concern of his ſucceſſor was probably leſs ſincere. He eſteemed the virtues of Pertinax, but thoſe virtues would for ever have confined his ambition to a private ſtation. Severus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his funeral oration with ſtudied elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, inward ſatisfaction, and well-acted ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and by this pious regard to his memory, convinced the credulous multitude that <hi>he alone</hi> was worthy to ſupply his place. Senſible, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that arms, not ceremonies, muſt aſſert his claim to the empire, he left Rome at the end of thirty days, and, without ſuffering himſelf to be elated by this eaſy victory, prepared to encounter his more formidable rivals.</p>
            <p>The uncommon abilities and fortune of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus <note place="margin">Succeſs of Severus againſt Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and againſt Albinus.</note> have induced an elegant hiſtorian to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him with the firſt and greateſt of the Caeſars <note n="40" place="bottom">Herodian, l. iii. p. 112.</note>. The parallel is, at leaſt, imperfect. Where ſhall we find, in the character of Severus, the commanding ſuperiority of ſoul, the generous clemency, and the various genius, which could
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0034700101:212"/>
reconcile and unite the love of pleaſure, the thirſt of knowledge, and the fire of ambition <note n="41" place="bottom">Though it is not, moſt aſſuredly, the intention of Lucan, to exalt the character of Caeſar, yet the idea he gives of that hero, in the tenth book of the Pharſalia, where he deſcribes him, at the ſame time, making love to Cleopatra, ſuſtaining a ſiege againſt the power of Egypt, and converſing with the ſages of the country, is, in reality, the nobleſt panegyric.</note>? In one inſtance only, they may be compared, with ſome degree of propriety, in the celerity of their motions, and their civil victories. In leſs than four years <note n="42" place="bottom">Reckoning from his election, April 13, 193, to the death of Albinus, February 19, 197. See Tillemont's Chronology.</note>, Severus ſubdued the riches of the eaſt, and the valour of the weſt. He vanquiſhed <note place="margin">A. D. 193—197.</note> two competitors of reputation and ability, and defeated numerous armies, provided with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and diſcipline equal to his own. In that age, the art of fortification, and the principles of tactics, were well underſtood by all the Roman generals; and the conſtant ſuperiority of Severus was that of an artiſt, who uſes the ſame inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with more ſkill and induſtry than his rivals. I ſhall not, however, enter into a minute narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of theſe military operations; but as the two civil wars againſt Niger and againſt Albinus, were almoſt the ſame in their conduct, event, and conſequences, I ſhall collect into one point of view, the moſt ſtriking circumſtances, tending to develope the character of the conqueror, and the ſtate of the empire.</p>
            <p>Falſehood and inſincerity, unſuitable as they ſeem to the dignity of public tranſactions, offend <note place="margin">Conduct of the two civil wars.</note>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0034700101:213"/>
us with a leſs degrading idea of meanneſs, than when they are found in the intercourſe of private life. In the latter, they diſcover a want of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; in the other, only a defect of power: and, as it is impoſſible for the moſt able ſtateſman to ſubdue millions of followers and enemies by their own perſonal ſtrength, the world, under the name of policy, ſeems to have granted them a very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral indulgence of craft and diſſimulation. Yet <note place="margin">Arts of Severus</note> the arts of Severus cannot be juſtified by the moſt ample privileges of ſtate reaſon. He promiſed only to betray, he flattered only to ruin; and however he might occaſionally bind himſelf by oaths and treaties, his conſcience, obſequious to his intereſt, always releaſed him from the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient obligation <note n="43" place="bottom">Herodian, l. ii. p. 85.</note>.</p>
            <p>If his two competitors, reconciled by their <note place="margin">towards Niger;</note> common danger, had advanced upon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, perhaps Severus would have ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their united effort. Had they even attacked him, at the ſame time, with ſeparate views and ſeparate armies, the conteſt might have been long and doubtful. But they fell, ſingly and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, an eaſy prey to the arts as well as arms of their ſubtle enemy, lulled into ſecurity by the moderation of his profeſſions, and overwhelmed by the rapidity of his action. He firſt marched againſt Niger, whoſe reputation and power he the moſt dreaded: but he declined any hoſtile declarations, ſuppreſſed the name of his antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, and only ſignified to the ſenate and people,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0034700101:214"/>
his intention of regulating the eaſtern provinces. In private he ſpoke of Niger, his old friend and intended ſucceſſor <note n="44" place="bottom">Whilſt Severus was very dangerouſly ill, it was induſtriouſly given out, that he intended to appoint Niger and Albinus his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. As he could not be ſincere with reſpect to both, he might not be ſo with regard to either. Yet Severus carried his hypocriſy ſo far, as to profeſs that intention in the memoirs of his own life.</note>, with the moſt affectionate regard, and highly applauded his generous deſign of revenging the murder of Pertinax. To puniſh the vile uſurper of the throne, was the duty of every Roman general. To perſevere in arms, and to reſiſt a lawful emperor, acknowledged by the ſenate, would alone render him criminal <note n="45" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 65.</note>. The ſons of Niger had fallen into his hands among the children of the provincial governors, detained at Rome as pledges for the loyalty of their parents <note n="46" place="bottom">This practice, invented by Commodus, proved very uſeful to Severus. He found, at Rome, the children of many of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal adherents of his rivals; and he employed them more than once to intimidate, or ſeduce, the parents.</note>. As long as the power of Niger inſpired terror, or even reſpect, they were edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the moſt tender care, with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Severus himſelf; but they were ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in their father's ruin, and removed, firſt by exile, and afterwards by death, from the eye of public compaſſion <note n="47" place="bottom">Herodian, l. iii. p. 56.

            <p>Whilſt Severus was engaged in his eaſtern war, <note place="margin">towards Albinus.</note> he had reaſon to apprehend that the governor of Britain might paſs the ſea and the Alps, occupy the vacant ſeat of empire, and oppoſe his return

with the authority of the ſenate and the forces of the weſt. The ambiguous conduct of Albinus, in not aſſuming the Imperial title, left room for negotiation. Forgetting, at once, his profeſſions of patriotiſm, and the jealouſy of ſovereign power, he accepted the precarious rank of Caeſar, as a reward for his fatal neutrality. Till the firſt conteſt was decided, Severus treated the man, whom he had doomed to deſtruction, with every mark of eſteem and regard. Even in the letter, in which he announced his victory over Niger, he ſtyles Albinus the brother of his ſoul and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſends him the affectionate ſalutations of his wife Julia, and his young family, and intreats him to preſerve the armies and the republic faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their common intereſt. The meſſengers charged with this letter, were inſtructed to accoſt the Caeſar with reſpect, to deſire a private audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to plunge their daggers into his heart <note n="48" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 84. Spartianus has inſerted this curious let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at full length.</note>. The conſpiracy was diſcovered, and the too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Albinus, at length, paſſed over to the continent, and prepared for an unequal conteſt with his rival, who ruſhed upon him at the head of a veteran and victorious army.</p>

natives of Aſia <note n="49" place="bottom">Conſult the third book of Herodian, and the ſeventy-fourth book of Dion Caſſius.</note>. The battle of Lyons, where one hundred and fifty thouſand <note n="50" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxv. p. 1260.</note> Romans were engaged, was equally fatal to Albinus. The valour of the Britiſh army maintained, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a ſharp and doubtful conteſt, with the hardy diſcipline of the Illyrian legions. The fame and perſon of Severus appeared, during a few moments, irrecoverably loſt, till that war-like prince rallied his fainting troops, and led them on to a deciſive victory <note n="51" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxv. p. 1261.

            <p>The civil wars of modern Europe have been <note place="margin">decided by one or two battles.</note> diſtinguiſhed, not only by the fierce animoſity, but likewiſe by the obſtinate perſeverance, of the contending factions. They have generally been juſtified by ſome principle, or, at leaſt, coloured by ſome pretext, of religion, freedom, or loyalty. The leaders were nobles of independent property and hereditary influence. The troops fought like men intereſted in the deciſion of the quarrel; and as military ſpirit and party zeal were ſtrongly diffuſed throughout the whole community, a van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed chief was immediately ſupplied with new adherents, eager to ſhed their blood in the ſame cauſe. But the Romans, after the fall of the republic, combated only for the choice of maſters.

Under the ſtandard of a popular candidate for empire, a few enliſted from affection, ſome from fear, many from intereſt, none from principle. The legions, uninflamed by party zeal, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured into civil war by liberal donatives, and ſtill more liberal promiſes. A defeat, by diſabling the chief from the performance of his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diſſolved the mercenary allegiance of his followers; and left them to conſult their own ſafety, by a timely deſertion of an unſucceſsful cauſe. It was of little moment to the provinces, under whoſe name they were oppreſſed or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; they were driven by the impulſion of the preſent power, and as ſoon as that power yielded to a ſuperior force, they haſtened to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the clemency of the conqueror, who, as he had an immenſe debt to diſcharge, was obliged to ſacrifice the moſt guilty countries to the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of his ſoldiers. In the vaſt extent of the Roman empire, there were few fortified cities ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of protecting a routed army; nor was there any perſon, or family, or order of men, whoſe natural intereſt, unſupported by the powers of government, was capable of reſtoring the cauſe of a ſinking party <note n="52" place="bottom">Monteſquieu, Conſiderations ſur la Grandeur et la Decadence des Romains, c. xii.</note>.</p>
            <p>Yet, in the conteſt between Niger and Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <note place="margin">Siege of Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</note> a ſingle city deſerves an honourable excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As Byzantium was one of the greateſt paſſages from Europe into Aſia, it had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a ſtrong garriſon, and a fleet of five

hundred veſſels was anchored in the harbour <note n="53" place="bottom">Moſt of theſe, as may be ſuppoſed, were ſmall open veſſels; ſome, however, were gallies of two, and a few of three ranks of oars.</note>. The impetuoſity of Severus diſappointed this prudent ſcheme of defence; he left to his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals the ſiege of Byzantium, forced the leſs guarded paſſage of the Helleſpont, and, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of a meaner enemy, preſſed forward to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter his rival. Byzantium, attacked by a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and increaſing army, and afterwards by the whole naval power of the empire, ſuſtained a ſiege of three years, and remained faithful to the name and memory of Niger. The citizens and ſoldiers (we know not from what cauſe) were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with equal fury; ſeveral of the principal officers of Niger, who deſpaired of, or who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, a pardon, had thrown themſelves into this laſt refuge: the fortifications were eſteemed impregnable, and, in the defence of the place, a celebrated engineer diſplayed all the mechanic powers known to the ancients <note n="54" place="bottom">The engineer's name was Priſcus.

Till the final deciſion of the war, the cruelty of Severus was, in ſome meaſure, reſtrained by the uncertainty of the event, and his pretended <note place="margin">Animoſity of Severus againſt the ſenate.</note> reverence for the ſenate. The head of Albinus, accompanied with a menacing letter, announced to the Romans, that he was reſolved to ſpare none of the adherents of his unfortunate compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors. He was irritated by the juſt ſuſpicion, that he had never poſſeſſed the affections of the ſenate, and he concealed his old malevolence under the recent diſcovery of ſome treaſonable correſpondences. Thirty-five ſenators, however, accuſed of having favoured the party of Albinus, he freely pardoned; and, by his ſubſequent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, endeavoured to convince them, that he had forgotten, as well as forgiven, their ſuppoſed offences. But, at the ſame time, he condemned forty-one <note n="57" place="bottom">Dion (l. lxxv. p. 1264.); only 29 ſenators are mentioned by him, but 41 are named in the Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 69. among whom were ſix of the name of Peſcennius.

The true intereſt of an abſolute monarch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally coincides with that of his people.

Severus conſidered the Roman empire as his property, and had no ſooner ſecured the poſſeſſion, than he beſtowed his care on the cultivation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſo valuable an acquiſition. Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary laws, executed with inflexible firmneſs, ſoon corrected moſt of the abuſes with which, ſince the death of Marcus, every part of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been infected.

            <p>Although the wounds of civil war appeared <note place="margin">Relaxation of military diſcipline.</note> completely healed, its mortal poiſon ſtill lurked in the vitals of the conſtitution. Severus poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed a conſiderable ſhare of vigour and ability; but the daring ſoul of the firſt Caeſar, or the deep policy of Auguſtus, were ſcarcely equal to the taſk of curbing the inſolence of the victorious legions. By gratitude; by miſguided policy, by ſeeming neceſſity, Severus was induced to relax the nerves of diſcipline <note n="63" place="bottom">Herodian, l. iii. p. 115. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 68.</note>. The vanity of his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0034700101:223"/>
ſoldiers was flattered with the honour of wearing gold rings; their eaſe was indulged in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of living with their wives in the idleneſs of quarters. He increaſed their pay beyond the example of former times, and taught them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and ſoon to claim, extraordinary donatives on every public occaſion of danger or feſtivity. Elated by ſucceſs, enervated by luxury, and raiſed above the level of ſubjects by their dangerous privileges <note n="64" place="bottom">Upon the inſolence and privileges of the ſoldiers, the 16th ſatire, falſely aſcribed to Juvenal, may be conſulted; the ſtyle and circumſtances of it would induce me to believe, that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed under the reign of Severus, or that of his ſon.</note>, they ſoon became incapable of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary fatigue, oppreſſive to the country, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of a juſt ſubordination. Their officers aſſerted the ſuperiority of rank by a more profuſe and elegant luxury. There is ſtill extant a letter of Severus, lamenting the licentious ſtate of the army, and exhorting one of his generals to begin the neceſſary reformation from the tribunes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſince, as he juſtly obſerves, the officer who has forfeited the eſteem, will never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the obedience, of his ſoldiers <note n="65" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 73.</note>. Had the emperor purſued the train of reflection, he would have diſcovered, that the primary cauſe of this general corruption might be aſcribed, not indeed to the example, but to the pernicious indulgence, however, of the commander in chief.</p>
            <p>The Praetorians, who murdered their emperor <note place="margin">New eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Praetorian guards.</note> and ſold the empire, had received the juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their treaſon; but the neceſſary,

though dangerous, inſtitution of guards, was ſoon reſtored on a new model by Severus, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to four times the ancient number <note n="66" place="bottom">Herodian, l. iii. p. 131.</note>. Formerly theſe troops had been recruited in Italy; and as the adjacent provinces gradually imbibed the ſofter manners of Rome, the levies were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Macedonia, Noricum, and Spain. In the room of theſe elegant troops, better adapted to the pomp of courts than to the uſes of war, it was eſtabliſhed by Severus, that from all the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the frontiers, the ſoldiers moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for ſtrength, valour, and fidelity, ſhould be occaſionally draughted; and promoted, as an honour and reward, into the more eligible ſervice of the guards <note n="67" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxiv. p. 1243.</note>. By this new inſtitution, the Italian youth were diverted from the exerciſe of arms, and the capital was terrified by the ſtrange aſpect and manners of a multitude of barbarians. But Severus flattered himſelf, that the legions would conſider theſe choſen Praetorians as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the whole military order; and that the preſent aid of fifty thouſand men, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in arms and appointments to any force that could be brought into the field againſt them, would for ever cruſh the hopes of rebellion, and ſecure the empire to himſelf and his poſterity.</p>
            <p>The command of theſe favoured and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable <note place="margin">The office of Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> troops ſoon became the firſt office of the empire. As the government degenerated into military deſpotiſm, the Praetorian Praefect, who
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0034700101:225"/>
in his origin had been a ſimple captain of the guards, was placed, not only at the head of the army, but of the finances, and even of the law. In every department of adminiſtration, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the perſon, and exerciſed the authority, of the emperor. The firſt Praefect who enjoyed and abuſed this immenſe power was Plautianus, the favourjte miniſter of Severus. His reign laſted above ten years, till the marriage of his daughter with the eldeſt ſon of the emperor, which ſeemed to aſſure his fortune, proved the occaſion of his ruin <note n="68" place="bottom">One of his moſt daring and wanton acts of power, was the caſtration of an hundred free Romans, ſome of them married men, and even fathers of families; merely that his daughter, on her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the young emperor, might be attended by a train of eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs worthy of an Eaſtern queen. Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1271.</note>. The animoſities of the palace, by irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the ambition and alarming the fears of Plautianus, threatened to produce a revolution, and obliged the emperor, who ſtill loved him, to conſent with reluctance to his death <note n="69" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1274. Herodian, l. iii. p. 122. 129. The grammarian of Alexandria ſeems, as it is not unuſual, much better acquainted with this myſterious tranſaction, and more aſſured of the guilt of Plautianus, than the Roman ſenator ventures to be.</note>. After the fall of Plautianus, an eminent lawyer, the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Papinian, was appointed to execute the motley office of Praetorian Praefect.</p>
            <p>Till the reign of Severus, the virtue and even <note place="margin">The ſenate oppreſſed by military deſpotiſm.</note> the good ſenſe of the emperors had been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their zeal or affected reverence for the ſenate, and by a tender regard to the nice frame of civil policy inſtituted by Auguſtus. But the youth of Severus had been trained in the implicit obedience of camps, and his riper years ſpent in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0034700101:226"/>
the deſpotiſm of military command. His haughty and inflexible ſpirit could not diſcover, or would not acknowledge, the advantage of preſerving an intermediate power, however imaginary, between the emperor and the army. He diſdained to profeſs himſelf the ſervant of an aſſembly that deteſted his perſon and trembled at his frown; he iſſued his commands, where his requeſt would have proved as effectual; aſſumed the conduct and ſtyle of a ſovereign and a conqueror, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, without diſguiſe, the whole legiſlative as well as the executive power.</p>
            <p>The victory over the ſenate was eaſy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious. <note place="margin">New max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of the Imperial preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> Every eye and every paſſion were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the ſupreme magiſtrate, who poſſeſſed the arms and treaſure of the ſtate; whilſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, neither elected by the people, nor guarded by military force, nor animated by public ſpirit, reſted its declining authority on the frail and crumbling baſis of ancient opinion. The fine theory of a republic inſenſibly vaniſhed, and made way for the more natural and ſubſtantial feelings of monarchy. As the freedom and honours of Rome were ſucceſſively communicated to the provinces, in which the old government had been either unknown, or was remembered with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the tradition of republican maxims was gradually obliterated. The Greek hiſtorians of the age of the Antonines <note n="70" place="bottom">Appian in Proem.</note> obſerve, with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious pleaſure, that although the ſovereign of Rome, in compliance with an obſolete prejudice, abſtained from the name of king, he poſſeſſed the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0034700101:227"/>
full meaſure of regal power. In the reign of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus, the ſenate was filled with poliſhed and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſlaves from the eaſtern provinces, who juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified perſonal flattery by ſpeculative principles of ſervitude. Theſe new advocates of prerogative were heard with pleaſure by the court, and with patience by the people, when they inculcated the duty of paſſive obedience, and deſcanted on the inevitable miſchiefs of freedom. The lawyers and the hiſtorians concurred in teaching, that the Imperial authority was held, not by the delegated commiſſion, but by the irrevocable reſignation of the ſenate; that the emperor was freed from the reſtraint of civil laws, could command by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary will the lives and fortunes of his ſubjects, and might diſpoſe of the empire as of his private patrimony <note n="71" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius ſeems to have written with no other view, than to form theſe opinions into an hiſtorical ſyſtem. The Pandects will ſhew how aſſiduouſly the lawyers, on their ſide, laboured in the cauſe of prerogative.</note>. The moſt eminent of the civil lawyers, and particularly Papinian, Paulus, and Ulpian, flouriſhed under the houſe of Severus; and the Roman juriſprudence having cloſely united itſelf with the ſyſtem of monarchy, was ſuppoſed to have attained its full maturity and perfection.</p>
            <p>The contemporaries of Severus, in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the peace and glory of his reign, forgave the cruelties by which it had been introduced. Poſterity, who experienced the fatal effects of his maxims and example, juſtly conſidered him as the principal author of the decline of the Roman empire.</p>

            <p>THE aſcent to greatneſs, however ſteep and dangerous, may entertain an active ſpirit with the conſciouſneſs and exerciſe of its own <note place="margin">Greatneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of Severus.</note> powers; but the poſſeſſion of a throne could never yet afford a laſting ſatisfaction to an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious mind. This melancholy truth was felt and acknowledged by Severus. Fortune and merit had, from an humble ſtation, elevated him to the firſt place among mankind. <q>He had been all things, as he ſaid himſelf, and all was of little value <note n="1" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 71. <q>Omnia fui et nihil expedit.</q>

The deſire of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating the greatneſs of his family, was the only remaining wiſh of his ambition and paternal tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>Like moſt of the Africans, Severus was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately <note place="margin">His wife the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</note> addicted to the vain ſtudies of magic and divination, deeply verſed in the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of dreams and omens, and perfectly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſcience of judicial aſtrology; which, in almoſt every age, except the preſent, has maintained its dominion over the mind of man. He had loſt his firſt wife, whilſt he was gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Lionneſe Gaul <note n="3" place="bottom">About the year 186, M. de Tillemont is miſerably embarraſſed with a paſſage of Dion, in which the empreſs Fauſtina, who died in the year 175, is introduced as having contributed to the marriage of Severus and Julia (l. lxxiv. p. 1243.). The learned compiler forgot, that Dion is relating, not a real fact, but a dream of Severus; and dreams are circumſcribed to no limits of time or ſpace. Did M. de Tillemont imagine that marriages were <hi>conſummated</hi> in the temple of Venus at Rome? Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. iii. p. 389. Note 6.</note>. In the choice of a ſecond, he ſought only to connect himſelf with ſome favourite of fortune; and as ſoon as he had diſcovered that a young lady of Emeſa in Syria had <hi>a royal nativity,</hi> he ſolicited, and obtained her hand <note n="4" place="bottom">Hiſt.

She poſſeſſed, even in an advanced age, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of beauty <note n="5" place="bottom">Hiſt.

Her amiable qualities never made any deep impreſſion on the dark and jealous temper of her huſband; but in her ſon's reign, ſhe adminiſtered the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal affairs of the empire, with a prudence, that ſupported his authority; and with a moderation, that ſometimes corrected his wild extravagancies <note n="6" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius, l. lxxvii. p. 1304. 1314.</note>. Julia applied herſelf to letters and philoſophy, with ſome ſucceſs, and with the moſt ſplendid

The grateful flattery of the learned has celebrated her virtues; but, if we may credit the ſcandal of ancient hiſtory, chaſtity was very far from being the moſt conſpicuous virtue of the empreſs Julia <note n="8" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1285.

            <p>Two ſons, Caracalla <note n="9" place="bottom">Baſſianus was his firſt name, as it had been that of his maternal grandfather. During his reign he aſſumed the appellation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus, which is employed by lawyers and ancient hiſtorians. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, the public indignation loaded him with the nick-names of Tarantus and Caracalla. The firſt was borrowed from a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Gladiator, the ſecond from a long Gallic gown which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the people of Rome.</note> and Geta, were the fruit <note place="margin">Their two ſons, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racalla and Geta.</note> of this marriage, and the deſtined heirs of the empire. The fond hopes of the father, and of the Roman world, were ſoon diſappointed by theſe vain youths, who diſplayed the indolent ſecurity of hereditary princes; and a preſumption that fortune would ſupply the place of merit and application. Without any emulation of virtue or talents, they diſcovered, almoſt from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, a fixed and implacable antipathy for each other. Their averſion, confirmed by years, and <note place="margin">Their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to each other.</note> fomented by the arts of their intereſted favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, broke out in childiſh, and gradually in more ſerious, competitions; and at length di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the theatre, the circus, and the court, into two factions; actuated by the hopes and fears of their reſpective leaders. The prudent emperor endeavoured, by every expedient of advice and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0034700101:231"/>
authority, to allay this growing animoſity. The unhappy diſcord of his ſons clouded all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and threatened to overturn a throne raiſed with ſo much labour, cemented with ſo much blood, and guarded with every defence of arms and treaſure. With an impartial hand he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between them an exact balance of favour, conferred on both the rank of Auguſtus, with the revered name of Antoninus; and for the firſt time the Roman world beheld three emperors <note n="10" place="bottom">The elevation of Caracalla is fixed by the accurate M. de Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemont to the year 198: the aſſociation of Geta to the year 208.</note>. <note place="margin">Three em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</note> Yet even this equal conduct ſerved only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the conteſt, whilſt the fierce Caracalla aſſerted the right of primogeniture, and the milder Geta courted the affections of the people and the ſoldiers. In the anguiſh of a diſappointed father, Severus foretold, that the weaker of his ſons would fall a ſacrifice to the ſtronger; who, in his turn, would be ruined by his own vices <note n="11" place="bottom">Herodian, l. iii. p. 130.

            <p>In theſe circumſtances the intelligence of a war <note place="margin">The Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian war.</note> in Britain, and of an invaſion of the province by the barbarians of the North, was received <note place="margin">A. D. 208.</note> with pleaſure by Severus. Though the vigilance of his lieutenants might have been ſufficient to repel the diſtant enemy, he reſolved to embrace the honourable pretext of withdrawing his ſons from the luxury of Rome, which enervated their minds and irritated their paſſions; and of inur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their youth to the toils of war and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Notwithſtanding his advanced age (for
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0034700101:232"/>
he was above three-ſcore), and his gout, which obliged him to be carried in a litter, he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported himſelf in perſon into that remote iſland, attended by his two ſons, his whole court, and a formidable army. He immediately paſſed the walls of Hadrian and Antoninus, and entered the enemy's country, with a deſign of completing the long attempted conqueſt of Britain. He penetrated to the northern extremity of the iſland, without meeting an enemy. But the concealed ambuſcades of the Caledonians, who hung un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen on the rear and flanks of his army, the coldneſs of the climate, and the ſeverity of a winter march acroſs the hills and moraſſes of Scotland, are reported to have coſt the Romans above fifty thouſand men. The Caledonians at length yielded to the powerful and obſtinate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, ſued for peace, and ſurrendered a part of their arms, and a large tract of territory. But their apparent ſubmiſſion laſted no longer than the preſent terror. As ſoon as the Roman legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had retired, they reſumed their hoſtile inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. Their reſtleſs ſpirit provoked Severus to ſend a new army into Caledonia, with the moſt bloody orders, not to ſubdue but to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the natives. They were ſaved by the death of their haughty enemy <note n="12" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1280, &amp;c. Herodian, l. iii. p. 132, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>This Caledonian war, neither marked by deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <note place="margin">Fingal and his heroes.</note> events, nor attended with any important conſequences, would ill deſerve our attention; but it is ſuppoſed, not without a conſiderable
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0034700101:233"/>
degree of probability, that the invaſion of Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus is connected with the moſt ſhining period of the Britiſh hiſtory or fable. Fingal, whoſe fame, with that of his heroes and bards, has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in our language by a recent publication, is ſaid to have commanded the Caledonians in that memorable juncture, to have eluded the power of Severus, and to have obtained a ſignal victory on the banks of the Carun, in which the ſon of <hi>the King of the World,</hi> Caracul, fled from his arms along the fields of his pride <note n="13" place="bottom">Oſſian's Poems, vol. i. p. 175.</note>. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a doubtful miſt ſtill hangs over theſe High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land traditions; nor can it be entirely diſpelled by the moſt ingenious reſearches of modern cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm <note n="14" place="bottom">That the Caracul of Oſſian is the Caracalla of the Roman Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, is, perhaps, the only point of Britiſh antiquity in which Mr. Macpherſon and Mr. Whitaker are of the ſame opinion; and yet the opinion is not without difficulty. In the Caledonian war, the ſon of Severus was known only by the appellation of Antoninus; and it may ſeem ſtrange, that the Highland bard ſhould deſcribe him by a nick-name, invented four years afterwards, ſcarcely uſed by the Romans till after the death of that emperor, and ſeldom employed by the moſt ancient hiſtorians. See Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1317. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 89. Aurel. Victor. Euſeb. in Chron. ad ann. 214.</note>: but if we could, with ſafety, indulge <note place="margin">Contraſt of the Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians and the Romans.</note> the pleaſing ſuppoſition, that Fingal lived, and that Oſſian ſung, the ſtriking contraſt of the ſituation and manners of the contending nations might amuſe a philoſophic mind. The parallel would be little to the advantage of the more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized people, if we compared the unrelenting revenge of Severus with the generous clemency of Fingal; the timid and brutal cruelty of Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calla,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0034700101:234"/>
with the bravery, the tenderneſs, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant genius of Oſſian; the mercenary chiefs who, from motives of fear or intereſt, ſerved under the Imperial ſtandard, with the freeborn warriors who ſtarted to arms at the voice of the king of Morven; if, in a word, we contemplated the untutored Caledonians, glowing with the warm virtues of nature, and the degenerate Romans, polluted with the mean vices of wealth and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>The declining health and laſt illneſs of Severus <note place="margin">Ambition of Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calla.</note> inflamed the wild ambition and black paſſions of Caracalla's ſoul. Impatient of any delay or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of empire, he attempted, more than once, to ſhorten the ſmall remainder of his father's days, and endeavoured, but without ſucceſs, to excite a mutiny among the troops <note n="15" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1282. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 71. Aurel. Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note>. The old emperor had often cenſured the miſguided lenity of Marcus, who, by a ſingle act of juſtice, might have ſaved the Romans from the tyranny of his worthleſs ſon. Placed in the ſame ſituation, he experienced how eaſily the rigour of a judge diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves away in the tenderneſs of a parent. He deliberated, he threatened, but he could not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; and this laſt and only inſtance of mercy, was more fatal to the empire than a long ſeries of cruelty <note n="16" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1283. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 89.</note>. The diſorder of his mind <note place="margin">Death of Severus, and acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his two ſons.</note> irritated the pains of his body; he wiſhed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently for death, and haſtened the inſtant of it by his impatience. He expired at York in <note place="margin">A. D. 4th Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</note>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0034700101:235"/>
the ſixty-fifth year of his life, and in the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of a glorious and ſucceſsful reign. In his laſt moments he recommended concord to his ſons, and his ſons to the army. The ſalutary advice never reached the heart, or even the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, of the impetuous youths; but the more obedient troops, mindful of their oath of allegiance, and of the authority of their deceaſed maſter, reſiſted the ſolicitations of Caracalla, and proclaimed both brothers emperors of Rome. The new princes ſoon left the Caledonians in peace, returned to the capital, celebrated their father's funeral with divine honours, and were cheerfully acknowledged as lawful ſovereigns, by the ſenate, the people, and the provinces. Some pre-eminence of rank ſeems to have been allowed to the elder brother; but they both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered the empire with equal and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power <note n="17" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1284. Herodian, l. iii. p. 135.</note>.</p>
            <p>Such a divided form of government would have <note place="margin">Jealouſy and hatred of the two emperors.</note> proved a ſource of diſcord between the moſt affectionate brothers. It was impoſſible that it could long ſubſiſt between two implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who neither deſired nor could truſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. It was viſible that one only could reign, and that the other muſt fall; and each of them judging of his rival's deſigns by his own, guarded his life with the moſt jealous vigilance from the repeated attacks of poiſon or the ſword. Their rapid journey through Gaul and Italy,

But we ſhould recollect that the opulent ſenators had almoſt ſurrounded the city with their extenſive gardens and ſuburb palaces, the greateſt part of which had been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually confiſcated by the emperors. If Geta reſided in the gardens that bore his name on the Janiculum; and if Caracalla inhabited the gardens of Maecenas on the Eſqueline, the rival brothers were ſeparated from each other by the diſtance of ſeveral miles; and yet the intermediate ſpace was filled by the Imperial gardens of Salluſt, of Lucullus, of Agrippa, of Domitian, of Caius, &amp;c. all ſkirting round the city, and all connected with each other, and with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, by bridges thrown over the Tiber and the ſtreets.

It was propoſed, that ſince it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reconcile their minds, they ſhould ſeparate their intereſt, and divide the empire between them. The conditions of the treaty were already drawn with ſome accuracy. It was agreed, that Caracalla, as the elder brother, ſhould remain in poſſeſſion of Europe and the weſtern Africa; and that he ſhould relinquiſh the ſovereignty of Aſia and Egypt to Geta, who might fix his reſidence at Alexandria or Antioch, cities little inferior to Rome itſelf in wealth and greatneſs; that numerous armies ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly encamped on either ſide of the Thracian Boſphorus, to guard the frontiers of the rival monarchies; and that the ſenators of European extraction ſhould acknowledge the ſovereign of Rome, whilſt the natives of Aſia followed the emperor of the Eaſt.

The conſciouſneſs of his crime ſhould have induced him to convince mankind, by the virtues of his reign, that the bloody deed had been the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary effect of fatal neceſſity. But the repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Caracalla only prompted him to remove from the world whatever could remind him of his guilt, or recal the memory of his murdered brother. On his return from the ſenate to the palace, he found his mother in the company of ſeveral noble matrons, weeping over the untimely fate of her younger ſon. The jealous emperor threatened them with inſtant death; the ſentence was executed againſt Fadilla, the laſt remaining daughter of the emperor Marcus; and even the afflicted Julia was obliged to ſilence her lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, to ſuppreſs her ſighs, and to receive the aſſaſſin with ſmiles of joy and approbation.

            <p>The execution of ſo many innocent citizens <note place="margin">Death of Papinian,</note> was bewailed by the ſecret tears of their friends and families. The death of Papinian, the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian praefect, was lamented as a public cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. During the laſt ſeven years of Severus, he had exerciſed the moſt important offices of the ſtate, and, by his ſalutary influence, guided the emperor's ſteps in the paths of juſtice and moderation. In full aſſurance of his virtues and abilities, Severus, on his death-bed, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him to watch over the proſperity and union

of the Imperial family <note n="29" place="bottom">It is ſaid that Papinian was himſelf a relation of the empreſs Julia.</note>. The honeſt labours of Papinian ſerved only to inflame the hatred which Caracalla had already conceived againſt his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's miniſter. After the murder of Geta, the Praefect was commanded to exert the powers of his ſkill and eloquence in a ſtudied apology for that atrocious deed. The philoſophic Seneca had condeſcended to compoſe a ſimilar epiſtle to the ſenate, in the name of the ſon and aſſaſſin of Agrippina <note n="30" place="bottom">Tacit.

The reſt of his reign was ſpent in the ſeveral provinces of the empire, particularly thoſe of the Eaſt, and every province was by turns the ſcene of his rapine and cruelty. The ſenators, compelled by fear to attend his capricious motions, were obliged to provide daily entertainments at an immenſe expence, which he abandoned with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to his guards; and to erect, in every city, magnificent palaces and theatres, which he either diſdained to viſit, or ordered to be immediately thrown down.

The careleſs profuſion of the ſon was the policy of one reign, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable ruin both of the army and of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The vigour of the ſoldiers, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed by the ſevere diſcipline of camps, melted away in the luxury of cities. The exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive increaſe of their pay and donatives <note n="38" place="bottom">Dion (l. lxxviii. p. 1343.) informs us, that the extraordinary gifts of Caracalla to the army amounted annually to ſeventy mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of drachmae (about two millions three hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds). There is another paſſage in Dion, concerning the military pay, infinitely curious; were it not obſcure, imperfect, and probably corrupt. The beſt ſenſe ſeems to be, that the Praetorian received twelve hundred and fifty drachmae (forty pounds) a year (Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1307.). Under the reign of Auguſtus, they were paid at the rate of two drachmae, or denarii, per day, 720 a year (Tacit. Annal. i. 17.). Domitian, who increaſed the ſoldiers pay one fourth, muſt have raiſed the Praetorians to 960 drachmae (Gronovius de Pecuniâ Veteri, l. iii. c. 2.). Theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive augmentations ruined the empire, for, with the ſoldiers pay, their numbers too were increaſed.

ed the ſtate to enrich the military order, whoſe modeſty in peace, and ſervice in war, is beſt ſecured by an honourable poverty. The demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of Caracalla was haughty and full of pride; but with the troops he forgot even the proper dignity of his rank, encouraged their inſolent familiarity, and, neglecting the eſſential duties of a general, affected to imitate the dreſs and manners of a common ſoldier.</p>
            <p>It was impoſſible that ſuch a character, and <note place="margin">Murder of Caracalla. A. D. 217. 8th March.</note> ſuch a conduct as that of Caracalla, could inſpire either love or eſteem; but as long as his vices were beneficial to the armies, he was ſecure from the danger of rebellion. A ſecret conſpiracy, provoked by his own jealouſy, was fatal to the tyrant. The Praetorian praefecture was divided between two miniſters. The military depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was intruſted to Adventus, an experienced rather than an able ſoldier; and the civil affairs were tranſacted by Opilius Macrinus, who, by his dexterity in buſineſs, had raiſed himſelf, with a fair character, to that high office. But his favour varied with the caprice of the emperor, and his life might depend on the ſlighteſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, or the moſt caſual circumſtance. Malice or fanaticiſm had ſuggeſted to an African, deeply

ſkilled in the knowledge of futurity, a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous prediction, that Macrinus and his ſon were deſtined to reign over the empire. The report was ſoon diffuſed through the province; and when the man was ſent in chains to Rome, he ſtill aſſerted, in the preſence of the Praefect of the city, the faith of his prophecy. That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who had received the moſt preſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to inform himſelf of the <hi>ſucceſſors</hi> of Caracalla, immediately communicated the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the African to the Imperial court, which at that time reſided in Syria. But, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diligence of the public meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, a friend of Macrinus found means to apprize him of the approaching danger. The emperor received the letters from Rome; and as he was then engaged in the conduct of a chariot race, he delivered them unopened to the Praetorian Praefect, directing him to diſpatch the ordinary affairs, and to report the more important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that might be contained in them. Macrinus read his fate, and reſolved to prevent it. He inflamed the diſcontents of ſome inferior officers, and employed the hand of Martialis, a deſperate ſoldier, who had been refuſed the rank of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion. The devotion of Caracalla prompted him to make a pilgrimage from Edeſſa to the celebrated temple of the Moon at Carrhae. He was attended by a body of cavalry; but having ſtopped on the road for ſome neceſſary occaſion, his guards preſerved a reſpectful diſtance, and Martialis approaching his perſon under a pretence of duty, ſtabbed him with a dagger. The bold
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0034700101:247"/>
aſſaſſin was inſtantly killed by a Scythian archer of the Imperial guard. Such was the end of a monſter whoſe life diſgraced human nature, and whoſe reign accuſed the patience of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <note n="39" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxviii. p. 1312.

The grateful ſoldiers forgot his vices, remembered only his partial liberality, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſenate to proſtitute their own dignity and that of religion by granting him a place among the gods. Whilſt he was upon earth, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Imitation of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</note> the Great was the only hero whom this god deemed worthy his admiration. He aſſumed the name and enſigns of Alexander, formed a Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian phalanx of guards, perſecuted the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Ariſtotle, and diſplayed with a puerile enthuſiaſm the only ſentiment by which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered any regard for virtue or glory. We can eaſily conceive, that after the battle of Narva, and the conqueſt of Poland, Charles the Twelfth (though he ſtill wanted the more elegant accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of the ſon of Philip) might boaſt of having rivalled his valour and magnanimity: but in no one action of his life did Caracalla expreſs the fainteſt reſemblance of the Macedonian hero, except in the murder of a great number of his own and of his father's friends <note n="40" place="bottom">The fondneſs of Caracalla for the name and enſigns of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, is ſtill preſerved on the medals of that emperor.

The choice of the army (for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a diſtant and feeble ſenate was little regarded) hung in an anxious ſuſpenſe; as no candidate preſented himſelf whoſe diſtinguiſhed birth and merit could engage their attachment and unite their ſuffrages. The deciſive weight of the Praetorian guards elevated the hopes of their praefects, and theſe powerful miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to aſſert their <hi>legal</hi> claim to fill the vacancy of the Imperial throne. Adventus, however, the ſenior praefect, conſcious of his age and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of his ſmall reputation, and his ſmaller abilities, reſigned the dangerous honour to the crafty ambition of his colleague Macrinus, whoſe well-diſſembled grief removed all ſuſpicion of his being acceſſary to his maſter's death <note n="41" place="bottom">Herodian, l. iv. p. 169.

They caſt their eyes around in ſearch of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor and at laſt yielded with reluctance to his promiſes of unbounded liberality and indulgence. A ſhort time after his acceſſion, he conferred on <note place="margin">A. D. 217.

But as ſoon as the firſt tranſports of joy and ſurpriſe had ſubſided, they began to ſcrutinize the merits of Macrinus with a critical ſeverity, and to arraign the haſty choice of the army. It had hitherto been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a fundamental maxim of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the emperor muſt be always choſen in the ſenate, and the ſovereign power, no longer exerciſed by the whole body, was always dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to one of its members.

A numerous body of troops was ſtationed at Emeſa; and, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere diſcipline of Macrinus had conſtrained them to paſs the winter encamped, they were eager to revenge the cruelty of ſuch unaccuſtomed hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. The ſoldiers, who reſorted in crowds to the temple of the Sun, beheld with veneration and delight the elegant dreſs and figure of a young pontiff: they recogniſed, or they thought that they recogniſed, the features of Caracalla, whoſe memory they now adored. The artful Maeſa ſaw and cheriſhed their riſing partiality, and readily ſacrificing her daughter's reputation to the fortune of her grandſon, ſhe inſinuated that Baſſianus was the natural ſon of their murdered ſovereign.

The letters of Macrinus had condeſcended to inform the ſenate of the ſlight diſturbance occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by an impoſtor in Syria, and a decree im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <note place="margin">Elagaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus writes to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> paſſed, declaring the rebel and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily public enemies; with a promiſe of pardon, however, to ſuch of his deluded adherents as ſhould merit it by an immediate return to their duty. During the twenty days that elapſed from the declaration to the victory of Antoninus (for in ſo ſhort an interval was the fate of the Roman world decided), the capital and the provinces, more eſpecially thoſe of the Eaſt, were diſtracted with hopes and fears, agitated with tumult, and ſtained with a uſeleſs effuſion of civil blood, ſince whoſoever of the rivals prevailed in Syria, muſt reign over the empire. The ſpecious letters in which the young conqueror announced his victory to the obedient ſenate, were filled with profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of virtue and moderation; the ſhining ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Marcus and Auguſtus, he ſhould ever conſider as the great rule of his adminiſtration; and he affected to dwell with pride on the ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſemblance of his own age and fortunes with thoſe of Auguſtus, who in the earlieſt youth had revenged by a ſucceſsful war the murder of his father. By adopting the ſtyle of Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Antoninus, ſon of Antoninus and grandſon of Severus, he tacitly aſſerted his hereditary claim to the empire; but, by aſſuming the tribunitian and proconſular powers before they had been conferred on him by a decree of the ſenate, he offended the delicacy of Roman prejudice. This new and injudicious violation of the conſtitution
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0034700101:257"/>
was probably dictated either by the ignorance of his Syrian courtiers, or the fierce diſdain of his military followers <note n="50" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxix. p. 1353.</note>.</p>

A faithful picture, however, which preceded his arrival, and was placed by his immediate order over the altar of Victory in the ſenate-houſe, conveyed to the Romans the juſt but unworthy reſemblance of his perſon and manners.

black conical ſtone, which, as it was univerſally believed, had fallen from heaven on that ſacred place. To this protecting deity, Antoninus, not without ſome reaſon, aſcribed his elevation to the throne. The diſplay of ſuperſtitious grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, was the only ſerious buſineſs of his reign. The triumph of the god of Emeſa over all the religions of the earth, was the great object of his zeal and vanity: and the appellation of Elagaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus (for he preſumed as pontiff and favourite to adopt that ſacred name) was dearer to him than all the titles of Imperial greatneſs. In a ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion through the ſtreets of Rome, the way was ſtrewed with gold duſt; the black ſtone, ſet in precious gems, was placed on a chariot drawn by ſix milk-white horſes richly capariſoned. The pious emperor held the reins, and, ſupported by his miniſters, moved ſlowly backwards, that he might perpetually enjoy the felicity of the divine preſence. In a magnificent temple raiſed on the Palatine Mount, the ſacrifices of the god Elaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus were celebrated with every circumſtance of coſt and ſolemnity.

Provoked at this new inſtance of their affection for his couſin, and their contempt for his perſon, the emperor ventured to puniſh ſome of the leaders of the mutiny. His unſeaſonable ſeverity proved inſtantly fatal to his minions, his mother, and himſelf. Elagabalus was maſſacred by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignant Praetorians, his mutilated corpſe dragged through the ſtreets of the city, and thrown into the Tyber. His memory was branded with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal infamy by the ſenate; the juſtice of whoſe decree has been ratified by poſterity <note n="62" place="bottom">The aera of the death of Elagabalus, and of the acceſſion of Alexander, has employed the learning and ingenuity of Pagi, Tillemont, Valſecchi, Vignoli, and Torre biſhop of Adria.

The good ſenſe, or the indifference, of ſucceeding princes, reſtrained them from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the prejudices of their ſubjects; and it was reſerved for the profligate Elagabalus, to diſcharge the acts of the ſenate, with the name of his mother Soaemias, who was placed by the ſide of the conſuls, and ſubſcribed, as a regular member, the decrees of the legiſlative aſſembly. Her more prudent ſiſter, Mamaea, declined the uſeleſs and odious prerogative, and a ſolemn law was enacted, excluding women for ever from the ſenate, and devoting to the infernal gods, the head of the wretch by whom this ſanction ſhould be violated <note n="66" place="bottom">Hiſt.

Alexander roſe early: the firſt moments of the day were conſecrated to private devotion, and his domeſtic chapel was filled with the images of thoſe heroes, who, by improving or reforming human life, had deſerved the grateful reverence of poſterity. But, as he
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0034700101:269"/>
deemed the ſervice of mankind the moſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able worſhip of the gods, the greateſt part of his morning hours was employed in his council, where he diſcuſſed public affairs, and determined private cauſes, with a patience and diſcretion above his years. The dryneſs of buſineſs was relieved by the charms of literature: and a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time was always ſet apart for his favourite ſtudies of poetry, hiſtory, and philoſophy. The works of Virgil and Horace, the republics of Plato and Cicero, formed his taſte, enlarged his underſtanding, and gave him the nobleſt ideas of man and government. The exerciſes of the body ſucceeded to thoſe of the mind; and Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, who was tall, active, and robuſt, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed moſt of his equals in the gymnaſtic arts. Refreſhed by the uſe of the bath and a ſlight din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he reſumed, with new vigour, the buſineſs of the day; and, till the hour of ſupper, the principal meal of the Romans, he was attended by his ſecretaries, with whom he read and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the multitude of letters, memorials, and petitions, that muſt have been addreſſed to the maſter of the greateſt part of the world. His table was ſerved with the moſt frugal ſimplicity; and whenever he was at liberty to conſult his own inclination, the company conſiſted of a few ſelect friends, men of learning and virtue, amongſt whom Ulpian was conſtantly invited. Their converſation was familiar and inſtructive; and the pauſes were occaſionally enlivened by the recital of ſome pleaſing compoſition, which ſupplied the place of the dancers, comedians, and even gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators,

The dreſs of Alexander was plain and modeſt, his demeanor courteous and affable: at the proper hours his palace was open to all his ſubjects, but the voice of a crier was heard, as in the Eleuſinian myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, pronouncing the ſame ſalutary admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <q>Let none enter thoſe holy walls, unleſs he is conſcious of a pure and innocent mind <note n="71" place="bottom">Hiſt.

            <p>Such an uniform tenour of life, which left <note place="margin">General happineſs of the Roman world. A.

Since the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Commodus, the Roman world had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, during a term of forty years, the ſucceſſive and various vices of four tyrants. From the death of Elagabalus, it enjoyed an auſpicious calm of thirteen years. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, relieved from the oppreſſive taxes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Caracalla and his pretended ſon, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in peace and proſperity, under the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of magiſtrates, who were convinced by experience, that to deſerve the love of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, was their beſt and only method of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the favour of their ſovereign. While ſome gentle reſtraints were impoſed on the innocent luxury of the Roman people, the price of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and the intereſt of money, were reduced,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0034700101:271"/>
by the paternal care of Alexander, whoſe prudent liberality, without diſtreſſing the induſtrious, ſupplied the wants and amuſements of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. The dignity, the freedom, the authority of the ſenate were reſtored; and every virtuous ſenator might approach the perſon of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, without fear, and without a bluſh.</p>
            <p>The name of Antoninus, ennobled by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues <note place="margin">Alexander refuſes the name of Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> of Pius and Marcus, had been communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by adoption to the diſſolute Verus, and by deſcent to the cruel Commodus. It became the honourable appellation of the ſons of Severus, was beſtowed on young Diadumenianus, and at length proſtituted to the infamy of the high prieſt of Emeſa. Alexander, though preſſed by the ſtudied, and perhaps ſincere importunity of the ſenate, nobly refuſed the borrowed luſtre of a name; whilſt in his whole conduct he laboured to reſtore the glories and felicity of the age of the genuine Antonines <note n="72" place="bottom">See in the Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 116, 117, the whole conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Alexander and the ſenate, extracted from the journals of that aſſembly. It happened on the ſixth of March, probably of the year 223, when the Romans had enjoyed, almoſt a twelvemonth, the bleſſings of his reign. Before the appellation of Antoninus was offered him as a title of honour, the ſenate waited to ſee whether Alexander would not aſſume it, as a family name.</note>.</p>
            <p>In the civil adminiſtration of Alexander, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note place="margin">He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to reform the army.</note> was enforced by power, and the people, ſenſible of the public felicity, repaid their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor with their love and gratitude. There ſtill remained a greater, a more neceſſary, but a more difficult enterpriſe; the reformation of the military order, whoſe intereſt and temper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

by long impunity, rendered them impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the reſtraints of diſcipline, and careleſs of the bleſſings of public tranquility. In the execution of his deſign the emperor affected to diſplay his love, and to conceal his fear, of the army. The moſt rigid oeconomy in every other branch of the adminiſtration, ſupplied a fund of gold and ſilver for the ordinary pay and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary rewards of the troops. In their marches he relaxed the ſevere obligation of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ſeventeen days proviſion on their ſhoulders. Ample magazines were formed along the public roads, and as ſoon as they entered the enemy's country, a numerous train of mules and camels waited on their haughty lazineſs. As Alexander deſpaired of correcting the luxury of his ſoldiers, he attempted, at leaſt, to direct it to objects of martial pomp and ornament, fine horſes, ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did armour, and ſhield enriched with ſilver and gold. He ſhared whatever fatigues he was obliged to impoſe, viſited, in perſon, the ſick and wounded, preſerved an exact regiſter of their ſervices and his own gratitude, and expreſſed, on every occaſion, the warmeſt regard for a body of men, whoſe welfare, as he affected to declare, was ſo cloſely connected with that of the ſtate <note n="73" place="bottom">It was a favourite ſaying of the emperor's, Se milites magis ſervare, quam ſeipſum; quod ſalus publica in his eſſet. Hiſt. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. p. 130.</note>. By the moſt gentle arts he laboured to inſpire the fierce multitude with a ſenſe of duty, and to reſtore at leaſt a faint image of that diſcipline to which the Romans owed their empire over ſo
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0034700101:273"/>
many other nations, as warlike and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than themſelves. But his prudence was vain, his courage fatal, and the attempt towards a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſerved only to inflame the ills it was meant to cure.</p>
            <p>The Praetorian guards were attached to the <note place="margin">Seditions of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian guards, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian.</note> youth of Alexander. They loved him as a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pupil, whom they had ſaved from a tyrant's fury, and placed on the Imperial throne. That amiable prince was ſenſible of the obligation; but as his gratitude was reſtrained within the limits of reaſon and juſtice, they ſoon were more diſſatisfied with the virtues of Alexander, than they had ever been with the vices of Elagabalus. Their praefect, the wiſe Ulpian, was the friend of the laws and of the people; he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the enemy of the ſoldiers, and to his pernicious counſels every ſcheme of reformation was imputed. Some trifling accident blew up their diſcontent into a furious mutiny; and a civil war raged, during three days, in Rome, whilſt the life of that excellent miniſter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the grateful people. Terrified, at length, by the ſight of ſome houſes in flames, and by the threats of a general conflagration, the people yielded with a ſigh, and left the virtuous, but unfortunate, Ulpian to his fate. He was purſued into the Imperial palace, and maſſacred at the feet of his maſter, who vainly ſtrove to cover him with the purple, and to obtain his pardon from the inexorable ſoldiers. Such was the deplorable weakneſs of government, that the emperor was unable to revenge his murdered
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0034700101:274"/>
friend and his inſulted dignity, without ſtooping to the arts of patience and diſſimulation. Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathus, the principal leader of the mutiny, was removed from Rome, by the honourable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of praefect of Egypt; from that high rank he was gently degraded to the government of Crete; and when, at length, his popularity among the guards was effaced by time and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Alexander ventured to inflict the tardy, but deſerved puniſhment of his crimes <note n="74" place="bottom">Though the author of the life of Alexander (Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 132.) mentions the ſedition raiſed againſt Ulpian by the ſoldiers, he conceals the cataſtrophe, as it might diſcover a weakneſs in the adminiſtration of his hero. From this deſigned omiſſion, we may judge of the weight and candour of that author.</note>. Under the reign of a juſt and virtuous prince, the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the army threatened with inſtant death his moſt faithful miniſters, who were ſuſpected of an intention to correct their intolerable diſorders. The hiſtorian Dion Caſſius had commanded the <note place="margin">Danger of Dion Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.</note> Pannonian legions with the ſpirit of ancient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. Their brethren of Rome, embracing the common cauſe of military licence, demanded the head of the reformer. Alexander, however, inſtead of yielding to their ſeditious clamours, ſhewed a juſt ſenſe of his merit and ſervices, by appointing him his colleague in the conſulſhip, and defraying from his own treaſury the expence of that vain dignity: but as it was juſtly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that if the ſoldiers beheld him with the enſigns of his office, they would revenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult in his blood, the nominal firſt magiſtrate of the ſtate retired, by the emperor's advice, from

The perſonal characters of the emperors, their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, laws, follies, and fortunes, can intereſt us no farther than as they are connected with the general hiſtory of the Decline and Fall of the monarchy.

His unbounded liberality flowed not, however, from the ſentiments of a generous mind; it was the forbid reſult of avarice, and will naturally be illuſtrated by ſome obſervations on the finances of that ſtate, from the victorious ages of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth to the reign of Alexander Severus.</p>

Some notion, however, may be formed of the revenue of the provinces where conſiderable wealth had been depoſited by nature, or collected by man, if we obſerve the ſevere attention that was directed to the abodes of ſolitude and ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility. Auguſtus once received a petition from the inhabitants of Gyarus, humbly praying that they might be relieved from one-third of their exceſſive impoſitions. Their whole tax amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed to no more than one hundred and fifty drachms, or about five pounds: but Gyarus was a little iſland, or rather a rock, of the Aegean ſea, deſtitute of freſh water and every neceſſary of life, and inhabited only by a few wretched fiſhermen <note n="95" place="bottom">Strabo, l. x. p. 485.

            <p>From the ſaint glimmerings of ſuch doubtful <note place="margin">Amount of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</note> and ſcattered lights, we ſhould be inclined to believe, 1ſt, That (with every fair allowance for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0034700101:284"/>
the difference of times and circumſtances) the general income of the Roman provinces could ſeldom amount to leſs than fifteen or twenty millions of our money <note n="96" place="bottom">Lipſius de magnitudine Romanâ (l. ii. c. 3.) computes the revenue at one hundred and fifty millions of gold crowns; but his whole book, though learned and ingenious, betrays a very heated imagination.</note>; and, 2dly, That ſo ample a revenue muſt have been fully adequate to all the expences of the moderate government inſtituted by Auguſtus, whoſe court was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt family of a private ſenator, and whoſe mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary eſtabliſhment was calculated for the defence of the frontiers, without any aſpiring views of conqueſt, or any ſerious apprehenſion of a foreign invaſion.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the ſeeming probability of <note place="margin">Taxes on Roman ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Auguſtus.</note> both theſe concluſions, the latter of them at leaſt is poſitively diſowned by the language and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Auguſtus. It is not eaſy to determine whether, on this occaſion, he acted as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon father of the Roman world, or as the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor of liberty; whether he wiſhed to relieve the provinces, or to impoveriſh the ſenate and the equeſtrian order. But no ſooner had he aſſumed the reins of government, than he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently intimated the inſufficiency of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and the neceſſity of throwing an equitable proportion of the public burden upon Rome and Italy. In the proſecution of this unpopular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he advanced, however, by cautious and well-weighed ſteps. The introduction of cuſtoms was followed by the eſtabliſhment of an exciſe,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0034700101:285"/>
and the ſcheme of taxation was completed by an artful aſſeſſment on the real and perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Roman citizens, who had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from any kind of contribution above a century and a half.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In a great empire like that of Rome, a <note place="margin">The cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</note> natural balance of money muſt have gradually eſtabliſhed itſelf. It has been already obſerved, that as the wealth of the provinces was attracted to the capital by the ſtrong hand of conqueſt and power; ſo a conſiderable part of it was reſtored to the induſtrious provinces by the gentle influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of commerce and arts. In the reign of Auguſtus and his ſucceſſors, duties were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on every kind of merchandiſe, which through a thouſand channels flowed to the great centre of opulence and luxury; and in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever manner the law was expreſſed, it was the Roman purchaſer, and not the provincial mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who paid the tax <note n="97" place="bottom">Tacit. Annal. xiii. 31.</note>. The rate of the cuſtoms varied from the eighth to the fortieth part of the value of the commodity; and we have a right to ſuppoſe that the variation was directed by the unalterable maxims of policy: that a higher duty was fixed on the articles of luxury than on thoſe of neceſſity, and that the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions raiſed or manufactured by the labour of the ſubjects of the empire, were treated with more indulgence than was ſhewn to the pernicious, or at leaſt the unpopular commerce of Arabia and

India <note n="98" place="bottom">See Pliny (Hiſt. Natur. l. vi. c. 23. l. xii. c. 18.). His ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that the Indian commodities were ſold at Rome at a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times their original price, may give us ſome notion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the cuſtoms, ſince that original price amounted to more than eight hundred thouſand pounds.</note>. There is ſtill extant a long but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect catalogue of eaſtern commodities, which about the time of Alexander Severus were ſubject to the payment of duties; cinnamon, myrrh, pepper, ginger, and the whole tribe of aromatics, a great variety of precious ſtones, among which the diamond was the moſt remarkable for its price, and the emerald for its beauty <note n="99" place="bottom">The ancients were unacquainted with the art of cutting dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</note>: Parthian and Babylonian leather, cottons, ſilks, both raw and manufactured, ebony, ivory, and eunuchs <note n="100" place="bottom">M. Bouchaud, in his treatiſe de l'Impot chez les Romains, has tranſcribed this catalogue, from the Digeſt, and attempts to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate it by a very prolix commentary.</note>. We may obſerve that the uſe and value of thoſe effeminate ſlaves gradually roſe with the decline of the empire.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The exciſe, introduced by Auguſtus after the civil wars, was extremely moderate, but it <note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</note> was general. It ſeldom exceeded one <hi>per cent.;</hi> but it comprehended whatever was ſold in the markets or by public auction, from the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable purchaſes of lands and houſes, to thoſe minute objects which can only derive a value from their infinite multitude and daily conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such a tax, as it affects the body of the people, has ever been the occaſion of clamour and diſcontent. An emperor well acquainted
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0034700101:287"/>
with the wants and reſources of the ſtate, was obliged to declare by a public edict, that the ſupport of the army depended in a great meaſure on the produce of the exciſe <note n="101" place="bottom">Tacit. Annal. i. 78. Two years afterwards, the reduction of the poor kingdom of Cappadocia gave Tiberius a pretence for diminiſhing the exciſe to one half; but the relief was of very ſhort duration.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">III. When Auguſtus reſolved to eſtabliſh a <note place="margin">Tax on le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies and inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</note> permanent military force for the defence of his government againſt foreign and domeſtic ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he inſtituted a peculiar treaſury for the pay of the ſoldiers, the rewards of the veterans, and the extraordinary expences of war. The ample revenue of the exciſe, though peculiarly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to thoſe uſes, was found inadequate. To ſupply the deficiency, the emperor ſuggeſted a new tax of five <hi>per cent.</hi> on all legacies and inheritances. But the nobles of Rome were more tenacious of property than of freedom. Their indignant murmurs were received by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus with his uſual temper. He candidly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the whole buſineſs to the ſenate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to provide for the public ſervice by ſome other expedient of a leſs odious nature. They were divided and perplexed. He inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to them, that their obſtinacy would oblige him to <hi>propoſe</hi> a general land-tax and capitation. They acquieſced in ſilence <note n="102" place="bottom">Dion Caſſius, l. lv. p. 794. l. lvi. p. 825.</note>. The new impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on legacies and inheritances was however mitigated by ſome reſtrictions. It did not take place unleſs the object was of a certain value,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0034700101:288"/>
moſt probably of fifty or an hundred pieces of gold <note n="103" place="bottom">The ſum is only fixed by conjecture.</note>; nor could it be exacted from the neareſt of kin on the father's ſide <note n="104" place="bottom">As the Roman law ſubſiſted for many ages, the <hi>Cognati,</hi> or relations on the mother's ſide, were not called to the ſucceſſion. This harſh inſtitution was gradually undermined by humanity, and finally aboliſhed by Juſtinian.</note>. When the rights of nature and poverty were thus ſecured, it ſeemed reaſonable, that a ſtranger, or a diſtant relation, who acquired an unexpected acceſſion of fortune, ſhould cheerfully reſign a twentieth part of it, for the benefit of the ſtate <note n="105" place="bottom">Plin.

            <p>Such a tax, plentiful as it muſt prove in every <note place="margin">Suited to the laws and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> wealthy community, was moſt happily ſuited to the ſituation of the Romans, who could frame their arbitrary wills, according to the dictates of reaſon or caprice, without any reſtraint from the modern fetters of entails and ſettlements. From various cauſes the partiality of paternal affection often loſt its influence over the ſtern patriots of the commonwealth, and the diſſolute nobles of the empire; and if the father bequeathed to his ſon the fourth part of his eſtate, he removed all ground of legal complaint <note n="106" place="bottom">See Heineccius in the Antiquit.

death. The arts of attendance and flattery were formed into a moſt lucrative ſcience; thoſe who profeſſed it acquired a peculiar appellation; and the whole city, according to the lively deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſatire, was divided between two parties, the hunters and their game <note n="107" place="bottom">Horat. l. ii. Sat. v. Petron. c. 116, &amp;c. Plin. l. ii. Epiſt. 20.</note>. Yet, while ſo many unjuſt and extravagant wills were every day dictated by cunning, and ſubſcribed by folly, a few were the reſult of rational eſteem and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous gratitude. Cicero, who had ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the lives and fortunes of his fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, was rewarded with legacies to the amount of an hundred and ſeventy thouſand pounds <note n="108" place="bottom">Cicero in Philipp. ii. c. 16.</note>; nor do the friends of the younger Pliny ſeem to have been leſs generous to that amiable orator <note n="109" place="bottom">See his epiſtles. Every ſuch will gave him an occaſion of diſplaying his reverence to the dead, and his juſtice to the living. He reconciled both, in his behaviour to a ſon who had been diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited by his mother (v. 1.).</note>. Whatever was the motive of the teſtator, the treaſury claimed, without diſtinction, the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of his eſtate; and in the courſe of two or three generations, the whole property of the ſubject muſt have gradually paſſed through the coffers of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>In the firſt and golden years of the reign of Nero, <note place="margin">Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the emperors.</note> that prince, from a deſire of popularity, and perhaps from a blind impulſe of benevolence, conceived a wiſh of aboliſhing the oppreſſion of the cuſtoms and exciſe. The wiſeſt ſenators ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded his magnanimity; but they diverted him
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0034700101:290"/>
from the execution of a deſign, which would have diſſolved the ſtrength and reſources of the republic <note n="110" place="bottom">Tacit. Annal. xiii. 50. Eſprit des Loix, l. xii. c. 19.</note>. Had it indeed been poſſible to realize this dream of fancy, ſuch princes as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan and the Antonines would ſurely have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with ardour the glorious opportunity of conferring ſo ſignal an obligation on mankind. Satisfied, however, with alleviating the public burden, they attempted not to remove it. The mildneſs and preciſion of their laws aſcertained the rule and meaſure of taxation, and protected the ſubject of every rank againſt arbitrary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, antiquated claims, and the inſolent vexation of the farmers of the revenue <note n="111" place="bottom">See Pliny's Panegyric, the Auguſtan Hiſtory, and Burman de Vectigal. paſſim.</note>. For it is ſomewhat ſingular, that, in every age, the beſt and wiſeſt of the Roman governors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered in this pernicious method of collecting the principal branches at leaſt of the exciſe and cuſtoms <note n="112" place="bottom">The tributes (properly ſo called) were not farmed; ſince the good princes often remitted many millions of arrears.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ſentiments, and, indeed, the ſituation of <note place="margin">Edict of Caracalla.</note> Caracalla, were very different from thoſe of the Antonines. Inattentive, or rather averſe to the welfare of his people, he found himſelf under the neceſſity of gratifying the inſatiate avarice, which he had excited in the army. Of the ſeveral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions introduced by Auguſtus, the twentieth on inheritances and legacies was the moſt fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as well as the moſt comprehenſive. As its
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0034700101:291"/>
influence was not confined to Rome or Italy, the produce continually increaſed with the gradual extenſion of the ROMAN CITY. The new citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, though charged, on equal terms <note n="113" place="bottom">The ſituation of the new citizens is minutely deſcribed by Pliny (Panegyric, c. 37, 38, 39).

Nor was the rapacious ſon of Severus contented with ſuch a meaſure of taxation, as had appeared ſufficient to his moderate predeceſſors. Inſtead of a twentieth, he exacted a tenth of all legacies and inheritances; and during his reign (for the ancient proportion was reſtored after his death) he cruſhed alike every part of the empire under the weight of his iron ſceptre <note n="114" place="bottom">Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1295.</note>.</p>

It is impoſſible to conjecture the motive that engaged him to ſpare ſo trifling a remnant of the public evil; but the noxious weed, which had not been totally eradicated, again ſprang up with the moſt luxuriant growth, and in the ſucceeding age darkened the Roman world with its deadly ſhade. In the courſe of this hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, we ſhall be too often ſummoned to explain the land-tax, the capitation, and the heavy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of corn, wine, oil, and meat, which were exacted from the provinces for the uſe of the court, the army, and the capital.</p>
            <p>As long as Rome and Italy were reſpected as <note place="margin">Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Rome.</note> the centre of government, a national ſpirit was preſerved by the ancient, and inſenſibly imbibed by the adopted, citizens. The principal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the army were filled by men who had received a liberal education, were well inſtructed in the advantages of laws and letters, and who had riſen, by equal ſteps, through the regular ſucceſſion of civil and military honours <note n="116" place="bottom">See the lives of Agricola, Veſpaſian, Trajan, Severus, and his three competitors; and indeed of all the eminent men of thoſe times.</note>.

But when the laſt encloſure of the Roman conſtitution was trampled down by Caracalla, the ſeparation of profeſſions gradually ſucceeded to the diſtinction of ranks. The more poliſhed citizens of the internal provinces were alone qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to act as lawyers and magiſtrates. The rougher trade of arms was abandoned to the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants and barbarians of the frontiers, who knew no country but their camp, no ſcience but that of war, no civil laws, and ſcarcely thoſe of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſcipline.

            <p>OF the various forms of government, which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy ſeems to preſent the faireſt ſcope for ridicule. Is it poſſible to relate, without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignant <note place="margin">The appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule</note> ſmile, that, on the father's deceaſe, the property of a nation, like that of a drove of oxen, deſcends to his infant ſon, as yet unknown to mankind and to himſelf; and that the braveſt warriors and the wiſeſt ſtateſmen, relinquiſhing their natural right to empire, approach the royal cradle with bended knees and proteſtations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable fidelity? Satire and declamation may paint theſe obvious topics in the moſt dazzling colours, but our more ſerious thoughts will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect a uſeful prejudice, that eſtabliſhes a rule of ſucceſſion, independent of the paſſions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and we ſhall cheerfully acquieſce in any expedient which deprives the multitude of the dangerous, and indeed the ideal, power of giving themſelves a maſter.</p>
            <p>In the cool ſhade of retirement, we may eaſily <note place="margin">and ſolid advantages of heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</note> deviſe imaginary forms of government, in which
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0034700101:295"/>
the ſceptre ſhall be conſtantly beſtowed on the moſt worthy, by the free and incorrupt ſuffrage of the whole community. Experience overturns theſe airy fabrics, and teaches us, that, in a large ſociety, the election of a monarch can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve to the wiſeſt, or to the moſt numerous, part of the people. The army is the only order of men ſufficiently united to concur in the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and powerful enough to impoſe them on the reſt of their fellow-citizens: but the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſoldiers, habituated at once to violence and to ſlavery, renders them very unfit guardians of a legal, or even a civil conſtitution. Juſtice, humanity, or political wiſdom, are qualities they are too little acquainted with in themſelves, to appreciate them in others. Valour will acquire their eſteem, and liberality will purchaſe their ſuffrage; but the firſt of theſe merits is often lodged in the moſt ſavage breaſts; the latter can only exert itſelf at the expence of the public; and both may be turned againſt the poſſeſſor of the throne, by the ambition of a daring rival.</p>
            <p>The ſuperior prerogative of birth, when it has <note place="margin">Want of it in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the greateſt calamities.</note> obtained the ſanction of time and popular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is the plaineſt and leaſt invidious of all diſtinctions among mankind. The acknowledged right extinguiſhes the hopes of faction, and the conſcious ſecurity diſarms the cruelty of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. To the firm eſtabliſhment of this idea, we owe the peaceful ſucceſſion, and mild admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, of European monarchies. To the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it, we muſt attribute the frequent civil
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0034700101:296"/>
wars, through which an Aſiatic Deſpot is obliged to cut his way to the throne of his fathers. Yet, even in the Eaſt, the ſphere of contention is uſually limited to the princes of the reigning houſe, and as ſoon as the more fortunate compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor has removed his brethren, by the ſword and the bow-ſtring, he no longer entertains any jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of his meaner ſubjects. But the Roman empire, after the authority of the ſenate had ſunk into contempt, was a vaſt ſcene of confuſion. The royal, and even noble, families of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, had long ſince been led in triumph before the car of the haughty republicans. The ancient families of Rome had ſucceſſively fallen beneath the tyranny of the Caeſars; and whilſt thoſe princes were ſhackled by the forms of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and diſappointed by the repeated failure of their poſterity <note n="1" place="bottom">There had been no example of three ſucceſſive generations on the throne; only three inſtances of ſons who ſucceeded their fathers. The marriages of the Caeſars (notwithſtanding the permiſſion, and the frequent practice of divorces) were generally unfruitful.</note>, it was impoſſible that any idea of hereditary ſucceſſion ſhould have taken root in the minds of their ſubjects. The right to the throne, which none could claim from birth, every one aſſumed from merit. The daring hopes of ambition were ſet looſe from the ſalutary reſtraints of law and prejudice; and the meaneſt of mankind might, without folly, entertain a hope of being raiſed by valour and fortune to a rank in the army, in which a ſingle crime would enable him to wreſt the ſceptre of the world from his feeble and unpopular maſter. After the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0034700101:297"/>
of Alexander Severus, and the elevation of Maximin, no emperor could think himſelf ſafe upon the throne, and every barbarian peaſant of the frontier might aſpire to that auguſt, but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtation.</p>
            <p>About thirty-two years before that event, the <note place="margin">Birth and fortunes of Maximin.</note> emperor Severus, returning from an eaſtern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, halted in Thrace, to celebrate, with military games, the birth-day of his younger ſon, Geta. The country flocked in crowds to behold their ſovereign, and a young barbarian of gigantic ſtature earneſtly ſolicited, in his rude dialect, that he might be allowed to contend for the prize of wreſtling. As the pride of diſcipline would have been diſgraced in the overthrow of a Roman ſoldier by a Thracian peaſant, he was matched with the ſtouteſt followers of the camp, ſixteen of whom he ſucceſſively laid on the ground. His victory was rewarded by ſome trifling gifts, and a permiſſion to inliſt in the troops. The next day, the happy barbarian was diſtinguiſhed above a crowd of recruits, dancing and exulting after the faſhion of his country. As ſoon as he perceived that he had attracted the emperor's notice, he inſtantly ran up to his horſe, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him on foot, without the leaſt appearance of fatigue, in a long and rapid career. <q>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, ſaid Severus, with aſtoniſhment, art thou diſpoſed to wreſtle after thy race?</q> Moſt willingly, Sir, replied the unwearied youth, and, almoſt in a breath, overthrew ſeven of the ſtrongeſt ſoldiers in the army. A gold collar was
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0034700101:298"/>
the prize of his matchleſs vigour and activity, and he was immediately appointed to ſerve in the horſe-guards who always attended on the perſon of the ſovereign <note n="2" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 138.</note>.</p>
            <p>Maximin, for that was his name, though born on the territories of the empire, deſcended from <note place="margin">His mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſervice and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note> a mixed race of barbarians. His father was a Goth, and his mother, of the nation of the Alani. He diſplayed, on every occaſion, a valour equal to his ſtrength; and his native fierceneſs was ſoon tempered or diſguiſed by the knowledge of the world. Under the reign of Severus and his ſon, he obtained the rank of centurion, with the favour and eſteem of both thoſe princes, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of whom was an excellent judge of merit. Gratitude forbade Maximin to ſerve under the aſſaſſin of Caracalla. Honour taught him to decline the effeminate inſults of Elagabalus. On the acceſſion of Alexander he returned to court, and was placed by that prince in a ſtation uſeful to the ſervice, and honourable to himſelf. The fourth legion, to which he was appointed tribune, ſoon became, under his care, the beſt diſciplined of the whole army. With the general applauſe of the ſoldiers, who beſtowed on their favourite hero the names of Ajax and Hercules, he was ſucceſſively promoted to the firſt military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note n="3" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 140. Herodian, l. vi. p. 223. Aurelius Victor. By comparing theſe authors, it ſhould ſeem, that Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imin had the particular command of the Triballian horſe, with the general commiſſion of diſciplining the recruits of the whole army. His Biographer ought to have marked, with more care, his exploits, and the ſucceſſive ſteps of his military promotions.</note>; and had not he ſtill retained too much
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0034700101:299"/>
of his ſavage origin, the emperor might perhaps have given his own ſiſter in marriage to the ſon of Maximin <note n="4" place="bottom">See the original letter of Alexander Severus, Hiſt. Auguſt.</note>.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of ſecuring his fidelity, theſe favours <note place="margin">Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of Maximin.</note> ſerved only to inflame the ambition of the Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian peaſant, who deemed his fortune inadequate to his merit, as long as he was conſtrained to acknowledge a ſuperior. Though a ſtranger to real wiſdom, he was not devoid of a ſelfiſh cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which ſhewed him, that the emperor had loſt the affection of the army, and taught him to improve their diſcontent to his own advantage. It is eaſy for faction and calumny to ſhed their poiſon on the adminiſtration of the beſt of princes, and to accuſe even their virtues, by artfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding them with thoſe vices to which they bear the neareſt affinity. The troops liſtened with pleaſure to the emiſſaries of Maximin. They bluſhed at their own ignominious patience, which, during thirteen years, had ſupported the vexatious diſcipline impoſed by an effeminate Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, the timid ſlave of his mother and of the ſenate. It was time, they cried, to caſt away that uſeleſs phantom of the civil power, and to elect for their prince and general a real ſoldier, educated in camps, exerciſed in war, who would aſſert the glory, and diſtribute among his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions the treaſures of the empire. A great
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0034700101:300"/>
army was at that time aſſembled on the banks of the Rhine, under the command of the emperor himſelf, who, almoſt immediately after his return from the Perſian war, had been obliged to march againſt the barbarians of Germany. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant care of training and reviewing the new levies was intruſted to Maximin. One day, as he entered the field of exerciſe, the troops, either from a ſudden impulſe or a formed conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, ſaluted him emperor, ſilenced by their loud acclamations his obſtinate refuſal, and haſtened to conſummate their rebellion by the murder of <note place="margin">A. D. 235. March 19.</note> Alexander Severus.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of his death are variouſly <note place="margin">Murder of Alexander Severus.</note> related. The writers, who ſuppoſe that he died in ignorance of the ingratitude and ambition of Maximin, affirm, that, after taking a frugal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt in the ſight of the army, he retired to ſleep, and that, about the ſeventh hour of the day, a part of his own guards broke into the Imperial tent, and, with many wounds, aſſaſſinated their virtuous and unſuſpecting prince <note n="5" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 135. I have ſoftened ſome of the moſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable circumſtances of this wretched biographer. From this ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worded narration, it ſhould ſeem, that the prince's buffoon having accidentally entered the tent, and awakened the ſlumbering mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, the fear of puniſhment urged him to perſuade the diſaffected ſoldiers to commit the murder.</note>. If we credit another, and indeed a more probable account, Maximin was inveſted with the purple by a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous detachment, at the diſtance of ſeveral miles from the head-quarters; and he truſted for ſucceſs rather to the ſecret wiſhes than to the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0034700101:301"/>
public declarations of the great army. Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had ſufficient time to awaken a faint ſenſe of loyalty among his troops; but their reluctant profeſſions of fidelity quickly vaniſhed on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Maximin, who declared himſelf the friend and advocate of the military order, and was unanimouſly acknowledged emperor of the Romans by the applauding legions. The ſon of Mamaea, betrayed and deſerted, withdrew into his tent, deſirous at leaſt to conceal his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fate from the inſults of the multitude. He was ſoon followed by a tribune and ſome centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions, the miniſters of death; but, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving with manly reſolution the inevitable ſtroke, his unavailing cries and entreaties diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced the laſt moments of his life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into contempt ſome portion of the juſt pity which his innocence and misfortunes muſt inſpire. His mother Mamaea, whoſe pride and avarice he loudly accuſed as the cauſe of his ruin, periſhed with her ſon. The moſt faithful of his friends were ſacrificed to the firſt fury of the ſoldiers. Others were reſerved for the more deliberate cruelty of the uſurper; and thoſe who experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the mildeſt treatment, were ſtripped of their employments, and ignominiouſly driven from the court and army <note n="6" place="bottom">Herodian, l. vi. p. 223—227.</note>.</p>
            <p>The former tyrants, Caligula and Nero, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus <note place="margin">Tyranny of Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</note> and Caracalla, were all diſſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced youths <note n="7" place="bottom">Caligula, the eldeſt of the four, was only twenty-five years of age when he aſcended the throne; Caracalla was twenty-three, Commodus nineteen, and Nero no more than ſeventeen.</note>, educated in the purple, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0034700101:302"/>
corrupted by the pride of empire, the luxury of Rome, and the perfidious voice of flattery. The cruelty of Maximin was derived from a different ſource, the fear of contempt. Though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the attachment of the ſoldiers, who loved him for virtues like their own, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that his mean and barbarian origin, his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage appearance, and his total ignorance of the arts and inſtitutions of civil life <note n="8" place="bottom">It appears that he was totally ignorant of the Greek language; which, from its univerſal uſe in converſation and letters, was an eſſential part of every liberal education.</note>, formed a very unfavourable contraſt with the amiable manners of the unhappy Alexander. He remembered, that, in his humbler fortune, he had often waited before the door of the haughty nobles of Rome, and had been denied admittance by the inſolence of their ſlaves. He recollected too the friendſhip of a few who had relieved his poverty, and aſſiſted his riſing hopes. But thoſe who had ſpurned, and thoſe who had protected the Thracian, were guilty of the ſame crime, the knowledge of his original obſcurity. For this crime many were put to death; and by the execution of ſeveral of his benefactors, Maximin publiſhed, in charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of blood, the indelible hiſtory of his baſeneſs and ingratitude <note n="9" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 141. Herodian, l. vii. p. 237. The latter of theſe hiſtorians has been moſt unjuſtly cenſured for ſparing the vices of Maximin.</note>.</p>
            <p>The dark and ſanguinary ſoul of the tyrant, was open to every ſuſpicion againſt thoſe among his ſubjects who were the moſt diſtinguiſhed by their birth or merit. Whenever he was alarmed
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0034700101:303"/>
with the ſound of treaſon, his cruelty was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded and unrelenting. A conſpiracy againſt his life was either diſcovered or imagined, and Magnus, a conſular ſenator, was named as the principal author of it. Without a witneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a trial, and without an opportunity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, Magnus, with four thouſand of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed accomplices, were put to death. Italy and the whole empire were infeſted with innumerable ſpies and informers. On the ſlighteſt accuſation, the firſt of the Roman nobles, who had governed provinces, commanded armies, and been adorned with the conſular and triumphal ornaments, were chained on the public carriages, and hurried away to the emperor's preſence. Confiſcation, exile, or ſimple death, were eſteemed uncommon inſtances of his lenity. Some of the unfortunate ſufferers he ordered to be ſewed up in the hides of ſlaughtered animals, others to be expoſed to wild beaſts, others again to be beaten to death with clubs. During the three years of his reign, he diſdained to viſit either Rome or Italy. His camp, occaſionally, removed from the banks of the Rhine to thoſe of the Danube, was the ſeat of his ſtern deſpotiſm, which trampled on every principle of law and juſtice, and was ſupported by the avowed power of the ſword <note n="10" place="bottom">The wife of Maximin, by inſinuating wiſe counſels with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male gentleneſs, ſometimes brought back the tyrant to the way of truth and humanity. See Ammianus Marcellinus, l. xiv. c. 1. where he alludes to the fact which he had more fully related under the reign of the Gordians. We may collect from the medals, that Paullina was the name of this benevolent empreſs; and from the title of <hi>Diva,</hi> that ſhe died before Maximin. (Valeſius ad loc. cit. Ammian.) Spanheim de U. et P. N. tom. ii. p. 300.</note>. No man
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0034700101:304"/>
of noble birth, elegant accompliſhments, or knowledge of civil buſineſs, was ſuffered near his perſon; and the court of a Roman emperor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the idea of thoſe ancient chiefs of ſlaves and gladiators, whoſe ſavage power had left a deep impreſſion of terror and deteſtation <note n="11" place="bottom">He was compared to Spartacus and Athenio. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 141.</note>.</p>
            <p>As long as the cruelty of Maximin was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined <note place="margin">Oppreſſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</note> to the illuſtrious ſenators, or even to the bold adventurers, who in the court or army ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to the caprice of fortune, the body of the people viewed their ſufferings with indifference, or perhaps with pleaſure. But the tyrant's avarice, ſtimulated by the inſatiate deſires of the ſoldiers, at length attacked the public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. Every city of the empire was poſſeſſed of an independent revenue, deſtined to purchaſe corn for the multitude, and to ſupply the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the games and entertainments. By a ſingle act of authority, the whole maſs of wealth was at once confiſcated for the uſe of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial treaſury. The temples were ſtripped of their moſt valuable offerings of gold and ſilver, and the ſtatues of gods, heroes, and emperors were melted down and coined into money. Theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious orders could not be executed without tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and maſſacres, as in many places the people choſe rather to die in the defence of their altars, than to behold in the midſt of peace their cities expoſed to the rapine and cruelty of war. The ſoldiers themſelves, among whom this ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious plunder was diſtributed, received it with a
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0034700101:305"/>
bluſh; and, hardened as they were in acts of violence, they dreaded the juſt reproaches of their friends and relations. Throughout the Roman world a general cry of indignation was heard, imploring vengeance on the common enemy of human kind; and at length, by an act of private oppreſſion, a peaceful and unarmed province was driven into rebellion againſt him <note n="12" place="bottom">Herodian, l. vii. p. 238. Zoſim. l. i. p. 15.</note>.</p>
            <p>The procurator of Africa was a ſervant worthy <note place="margin">Revolt in Africa. A. D. 237.

An ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous ſentence had been pronounced againſt ſome opulent youths of that country, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which would have ſtripped them of far the greater part of their patrimony. In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, a reſolution that muſt either complete or prevent their ruin, was dictated by deſpair. A reſpite of three days, obtained with difficulty from the rapacious treaſurer, was employed in collecting from their eſtates a great number of ſlaves and peaſants, blindly devoted to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their lords, and armed with the ruſtic weapons of clubs and axes. The leaders of the conſpiracy, as they were admitted to the audience of the procurator, ſtabbed him with the daggers concealed under their garments, and, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of their tumultuary train, ſeized on the little town of Thyſdrus <note n="13" place="bottom">In the fertile territory of Byzacium, one hundred and fifty miles to the ſouth of Carthage.

of rebellion againſt the ſovereign of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire. They reſted their hopes on the hatred of mankind againſt Maximin, and they judiciouſly reſolved to oppoſe to that deteſted tyrant, an emperor whoſe mild virtues had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acquired the love and eſteem of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and whoſe authority over the province would give weight and ſtability to the enterpriſe. Gordianus, their proconſul, and the object of their choice, refuſed, with unfeigned reluctance, the dangerous honour, and begged with tears that they would ſuffer him to terminate in peace a long and innocent life, without ſtaining his feeble age with civil blood. Their menaces compelled him to accept the Imperial purple, his only refuge indeed againſt the jealous cruelty of Maximin; ſince, according to the reaſoning of tyrants, thoſe who have been eſteemed worthy of the throne deſerve death, and thoſe who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate have already rebelled <note n="14" place="bottom">Herodian, l. vii. p. 239.

            <p>The family of Gordianus was one of the moſt <note place="margin">Character and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> illuſtrious of the Roman ſenate. On the father's ſide, he was deſcended from the Gracchi; on his mother's, from the emperor Trajan. A great eſtate enabled him to ſupport the dignity of his birth, and, in the enjoyment of it, he diſplayed an elegant taſte, and beneficent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The palace in Rome, formerly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the great Pompey, had been, during
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0034700101:307"/>
ſeveral generations, in the poſſeſſion of Gordian's family <note n="15" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 152. The celebrated houſe of Pompey <hi>in carinis,</hi> was uſurped by Marc Antony, and conſequently became, after the Triumvir's death, a part of the Imperial domain. The emperor Trajan allowed and even encouraged the rich ſenators to purchaſe thoſe magnificent and uſeleſs places (Plin. Panegyric. c. 50.): and it may ſeem probable, that, on this occaſion, Pompey's houſe came into the poſſeſſion of Gordian's great grandfather.</note>. It was diſtinguiſhed by ancient tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of naval victories, and decorated with the works of modern painting. His villa on the road to Praeneſte, was celebrated for baths of ſingular beauty and extent, for three ſtately rooms of an hundred feet in length, and for a magnificent portico, ſupported by two hundred columns of the four moſt curious and coſtly ſorts of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note n="16" place="bottom">The Claudian, the Numidian, the Caryſtian, and the Synna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. The colours of Roman marbles have been faintly deſcribed and imperfectly diſtinguiſhed.

He was twice elevated to the laſt mentioned dignity, by Caracalla and by Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander; for he poſſeſſed the uncommon talent of acquiring the eſteem of virtuous princes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alarming the jealouſy of tyrants. His long life was innocently ſpent in the ſtudy of letters and the peaceful honours of Rome; and, till he was named proconſul of Africa by the voice of the ſenate and the approbation of Alexander <note n="18" place="bottom">See the original letter, in the Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 152, which at once ſhews Alexander's reſpect for the authority of the ſenate, and his eſteem for the proconſul appointed by that aſſembly.</note>, he appears prudently to have declined the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of armies and the government of provinces. As long as that emperor lived, Africa was happy under the adminiſtration of his worthy repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative; after the barbarous Maximin had uſurped the throne, Gordianus alleviated the miſeries which he was unable to prevent. When he reluctantly accepted the purple, he was above fourſcore years old; a laſt and valuable remains of the happy age of the Antonines, whoſe virtues he revived in his own conduct, and celebrated in an elegant poem of thirty books. With the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable proconſul, his ſon, who had accompanied him into Africa as his lieutenant, was likewiſe declared emperor. His manners were leſs pure, but his character was equally amiable with that of his father. Twenty-two acknowledged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, and a library of ſixty-two thouſand vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, atteſted the variety of his inclinations; and from the productions which he left behind
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0034700101:309"/>
him, it appears that the former as well as the latter were deſigned for uſe rather than for oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note n="19" place="bottom">By each of his concubines, the younger Gordian left three or four children. His literary productions, though leſs numerous, were by no means contemptible.</note>. The Roman people acknowledged in the features of the younger Gordian the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Scipio Africanus, recollected with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that his mother was the grand-daughter of Antoninus Pius, and reſted the public hope on thoſe latent virtues which had hitherto, as they fondly imagined, lain concealed in the luxurious indolence of a private life.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Gordians had appeaſed the firſt <note place="margin">They ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> tumult of a popular election, they removed their court to Carthage. They were received with the acclamations of the Africans, who honoured their virtues, and who, ſince the viſit of Hadrian, had never beheld the majeſty of a Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. But theſe vain acclamations neither ſtrengthened nor confirmed the title of the Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. They were induced by principle, as well as intereſt, to ſolicit the approbation of the ſenate; and a deputation of the nobleſt provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials was ſent, without delay, to Rome, to relate and juſtify the conduct of their countrymen, who, having long ſuffered with patience, were at length reſolved to act with vigour. The letters of the new princes were modeſt and reſpectful, excuſing the neceſſity which had obliged them to accept the Imperial title; but ſubmitting their election

            <p>The inclinations of the ſenate were neither <note place="margin">The ſenate ratifies their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gordians;</note> doubtful nor divided. The birth and noble alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the Gordians had intimately connected them with the moſt illuſtrious houſes of Rome. Their fortune had created many dependants in that aſſembly, their merit had acquired many friends. Their mild adminiſtration opened the flattering proſpect of the reſtoration, not only of the civil but even of the republican government. The terror of military violence, which had firſt obliged the ſenate to forget the murder of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, and to ratify the election of a barbarian peaſant <note n="21" place="bottom">Quod tamen patres dum periculoſum exiſtimant; inermes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato reſiſtere approbaverunt. <hi>Aurelius Victor.</hi>
               </note>, now produced a contrary effect, and provoked them to aſſert the injured rights of freedom and humanity. The hatred of Maximin towards the ſenate was declared and implacable; the tameſt ſubmiſſion had not appeaſed his fury, the moſt cautious innocence would not remove his ſuſpicions; and even the care of their own ſafety urged them to ſhare the fortune of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, of which (if unſucceſsful) they were ſure to be the firſt victims. Theſe conſiderations, and perhaps others of a more private nature, were debated in a previous conference of the conſuls and the magiſtrates. As ſoon as their reſolution was decided, they convoked in the temple of Caſtor the whole body of the ſenate,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0034700101:311"/>
according to an ancient form of ſecrecy <note n="22" place="bottom">Even the ſervants of the houſe, the ſcribes, &amp;c. were excluded, and their office was filled by the ſenators themſelves.

Why do you caſt thoſe anxious looks on each other? why heſitate?

            <p>During the emperor's abſence, a detachment <note place="margin">Aſſumes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Rome and Italy,</note> of the Praetorian guards remained at Rome, to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0034700101:312"/>
protect, or rather to command the capital. The Praefect Vitalianus had ſignalized his fidelity to Maximin, by the alacrity with which he had obeyed, and even prevented, the cruel mandates of the tyrant. His death alone could reſcue the authority of the ſenate and the lives of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, from a ſtate of danger and ſuſpence. Before their reſolves had tranſpired, a quaeſtor and ſome tribunes were commiſſioned to take his devoted life. They executed the order with equal boldneſs and ſucceſs; and, with their bloody daggers in their hands, ran through the ſtreets, proclaiming to the people and the ſoldiers, the news of the happy revolution. The enthuſiaſm of liberty was ſeconded by the promiſe of a large donative, in lands and money; the ſtatues of Maximin were thrown down; the capital of the empire acknowledged, with tranſport, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the two Gordians and the ſenate <note n="24" place="bottom">Herodian, l. vii. p. 244.</note>; and the example of Rome was followed by the reſt of Italy.</p>
            <p>A new ſpirit had ariſen in that aſſembly, whoſe <note place="margin">and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for a civil war.</note> long patience had been inſulted by wanton deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm and military licence. The ſenate aſſumed the reins of government, and, with a calm intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, prepared to vindicate by arms the cauſe of freedom. Among the conſular ſenators re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by their merit and ſervices to the favour of the emperor Alexander, it was eaſy to ſelect twenty, not unequal to the command of an army, and the conduct of a war. To theſe
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0034700101:313"/>
was the defence of Italy intruſted. Each was appointed to act in his reſpective department, authorized to enrol and diſcipline the Italian youth; and inſtructed to fortify the ports and highways, againſt the impending invaſion of Maximin. A number of deputies, choſen from the moſt illuſtrious of the ſenatorian and equeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian orders, were diſpatched at the ſame time to the governors of the ſeveral provinces, earneſtly conjuring them to fly to the aſſiſtance of their country, and to remind the nations of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ties of friendſhip with the Roman ſenate and people. The general reſpect with which theſe deputies were received, and the zeal of Italy and the provinces in favour of the ſenate, ſufficiently prove that the ſubjects of Maximin were reduced to that uncommon diſtreſs, in which the body of the people has more to fear from oppreſſion than from reſiſtance. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of that melancholy truth, inſpires a degree of perſevering fury, ſeldom to be found in thoſe civil wars which are artificially ſupported for the benefit of a few factious and deſigning leaders <note n="25" place="bottom">Herodian, l. vii. p. 247. l. viii. p. 277.

            <p>For while the cauſe of the Gordians was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced <note place="margin">Defeat and death of the two Gordians. A.

The feeble court of Carthage was alarmed with the rapid approach of Capelianus, governor of Mauritania, who, with a ſmall band of veterans, and a fierce hoſt of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0034700101:314"/>
attacked a faithful, but unwarlike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. The younger Gordian ſallied out to meet the enemy at the head of a few guards, and a numerous undiſciplined multitude, educated in the peaceful luxury of Carthage. His uſeleſs valour ſerved only to procure him an honourable death, in the field of battle. His aged father, whoſe reign had not exceeded thirty-ſix days, put an end to his life on the firſt news of the defeat. Carthage, deſtitute of defence, opened her gates to the conqueror, and Africa was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the rapacious cruelty of a ſlave, obliged to ſatisfy his unrelenting maſter with a large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of blood and treaſure <note n="26" place="bottom">Herodian, l. vii. p. 254.

            <p>The fate of the Gordians filled Rome with juſt, <note place="margin">Election of Maximus and Balbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus by the ſenate. 9th July.</note> but unexpected terror. The ſenate convoked in the temple of Concord, affected to tranſact the common buſineſs of the day; and ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, with trembling anxiety, the conſideration of their own, and the public danger. A ſilent conſternation prevailed on the aſſembly, till a ſenator, of the name and family of Trajan, awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his brethren from their fatal lethargy. He repreſented to them, that the choice of cautious dilatory meaſures had been long ſince out of their power; that Maximin, implacable by nature,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0034700101:315"/>
and exaſperated by injuries, was advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Italy, at the head of the military force of the empire; and that their only remaining alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, was either to meet him bravely in the field, or tamely to expect the tortures and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death reſerved for unſucceſsful rebellion. <q>We have loſt, continued he, two excellent princes; but unleſs we deſert ourſelves, the hopes of the republic have not periſhed with the Gordians.

The virtues and the reputation of the new em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors juſtified the moſt ſanguine hopes of the <note place="margin">Their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</note> Romans. The various nature of their talents ſeemed to appropriate to each his peculiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of peace and war, without leaving room for jealous emulation. Balbinus was an admired orator, a poet of diſtinguiſhed fame, and a wiſe magiſtrate, who had exerciſed with innocence and applauſe the civil juriſdiction in almoſt all the interior provinces of the empire. His birth was noble <note n="28" place="bottom">He was deſcended from Cornelius Balbus, a noble Spaniard, and the adopted ſon of Theophanes the Greek hiſtorian. Balbus obtained the freedom of Rome by the favour of Pompey, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it by the eloquence of Cicero (ſee Orat. pro Cornel. Balbo). The friendſhip of Caeſar (to whom he rendered the moſt important ſecret ſervices in the civil war) raiſed him to the conſulſhip and the pontificate, honours never yet poſſeſſed by a ſtranger. The nephew of this Balbus triumphed over the Garamantes. See Dictionnaire de Bayle, au mot <hi>Balbus,</hi> where he diſtinguiſhes the ſeveral perſons of that name, and rectifies, with his uſual accuracy, the miſtakes of former writers concerning them.</note>, his fortune affluent, his manners liberal and affable. In him, the love of pleaſure was corrected by a ſenſe of dignity, nor had the habits of eaſe deprived him of a capacity for buſineſs. The mind of Maximus was formed in a rougher mould. By his valour and abilities he had raiſed himſelf from the meaneſt origin to the firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the ſtate and army. His victories over the Sarmatians and the Germans, the auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of his life, and the rigid impartiality of his juſtice, whilſt he was Praefect of the city, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the eſteem of a people, whoſe affections were engaged in favour of the more amiable Balbinus. The two colleagues had both been
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0034700101:317"/>
conſuls (Balbinus had twice enjoyed that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable office), both had been named among the twenty lieutenants of the ſenate; and ſince the one was ſixty and the other ſeventy-four years old <note n="29" place="bottom">Zonaras, l. xii. p. 622.

The Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 116, ſeems much more authentic.</note>. The ſolemn rites of ſacrifice were diſturbed by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the people. The licentious multitude neither loved the rigid Maximus, nor did they ſufficiently fear the mild and humane Balbinus. Their increaſing numbers ſurrounded the temple of Jupiter; with obſtinate clamours they aſſerted their inherent right of conſenting to the election of their ſovereign; and demanded, with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent moderation, that, beſides the two empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors choſen by the ſenate, a third ſhould be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the family of the Gordians, as a juſt return of gratitude to thoſe princes who had ſacrificed their lives for the republic. At the head of the city-guards, and the youth of the equeſtrian order, Maximus and Balbinus attempted to cut
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0034700101:318"/>
their way through the ſeditious multitude. The multitude, armed with ſticks and ſtones, drove them back into the Capitol. It is prudent to yield when the conteſt, whatever may be the iſſue of it, muſt be fatal to both parties. A boy, only thirteen years of age, the grandſon of the elder, and nephew of the younger, Gordian, was produced to the people, inveſted with the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and title of Caeſar. The tumult was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed by this eaſy condeſcenſion; and the two emperors, as ſoon as they had been peaceably acknowledged in Rome, prepared to defend Italy againſt the common enemy.</p>
            <p>Whilſt in Rome and Africa revolutions ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <note place="margin">Maximin prepares to attack the ſenate and their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</note> each other with ſuch amazing rapidity, the mind of Maximin was agitated by the moſt furious paſſions. He is ſaid to have received the news of the rebellion of the Gordians, and of the decree of the ſenate againſt him, not with the temper of a man, but the rage of a wild beaſt; which, as it could not diſcharge itſelf on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſenate, threatened the life of his ſon, of his friends, and of all who ventured to approach his perſon. The grateful intelligence of the death of the Gordians, was quickly followed by the aſſurance that the ſenate, laying aſide all hopes of pardon or accommodation, had ſubſtituted in their room two emperors, with whoſe merit he could not be unacquainted. Revenge was the only conſolation left to Maximin, and revenge could only be obtained by arms. The ſtrength of the legions had been aſſembled by Alexander
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0034700101:319"/>
from all parts of the empire. Three ſucceſsful campaigns againſt the Germans and the Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, had raiſed their fame, confirmed their diſcipline, and even increaſed their numbers, by filling the ranks with the flower of the barbarian youth. The life of Maximin had been ſpent in war, and the candid ſeverity of hiſtory cannot refuſe him the valour of a ſoldier, or even the abilities of an experienced general <note n="31" place="bottom">In Herodian, l. vii. p. 249, and in the Auguſtan Hiſtory, we have three ſeveral orations of Maximin to his army, on the rebellion of Africa and Rome: M. de Tillemont has very juſtly obſerved, that they neither agree with each other, nor with truth. Hiſtoire des Empereurs, tom. iii. p. 799.</note>. It might naturally be expected, that a prince of ſuch a character, inſtead of ſuffering the rebellion to gain ſtability by delay, ſhould immediately have marched from the banks of the Danube to thoſe of the Tyber, and that his victorious army, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated by contempt for the ſenate, and eager to gather the ſpoils of Italy, ſhould have burned with impatience to finiſh the eaſy and lucrative conqueſt. Yet as far as we can truſt to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure chronology of that period <note n="32" place="bottom">The careleſſneſs of the writers of that age leaves us in a ſingular perplexity. 1. We know that Maximus and Balbinus were killed during the Capitoline games. Herodian, l. viii. p. 285. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Cenſorinus (de Die Natali, c. 18.) enables us to fix thoſe games with certainty to the year 238, but leaves us in ignorance of the month or day. 2. The election of Gordian by the ſenate, is fixed, with equal certainty, to the 27th of May; but we are at a loſs to diſcover, whether it was in the ſame or the preceding year. Tillemont and Muratori, who maintain the two oppoſite opinions, bring into the field a deſultory troop of authorities, conjectures and probabilities. The one ſeems to draw out, the other to contract the ſeries of events, between thoſe periods, more than can be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to reaſon and hiſtory. Yet it is neceſſary to chuſe between them.</note>, it appears that
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0034700101:320"/>
the operations of ſome foreign war deferred the Italian expedition till the enſuing ſpring. From the prudent conduct of Maximin, we may learn that the ſavage features of his character have been exaggerated by the pencil of party, that his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, however impetuous, ſubmitted to the force of reaſon, and that the barbarian poſſeſſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the generous ſpirit of Sylla, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the enemies of Rome, before he ſuffered himſelf to revenge his private injuries <note n="33" place="bottom">Velleius Paterculus, l. ii. c. 24.

            <p>When the troops of Maximin, advancing in <note place="margin">Marches into Italy. A. D. 238. February.</note> excellent order, arrived at the foot of the Julian Alps, they were terrified by the ſilence and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that reigned on the frontiers of Italy. The villages and open towns had been abandoned on their approach by the inhabitants, the cattle was driven away, the proviſions removed, or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the bridges broke down, nor was any thing left which could afford either ſhelter or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to an invader. Such had been the wiſe orders of the generals of the ſenate; whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to protract the war, to ruin the army of Maximin by the ſlow operation of famine, and to conſume his ſtrength in the ſieges of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cities of Italy, which they had plentifully ſtored with men and proviſions from the deſerted country.

The opinion of a man who paſſed his life between the Alps and the Appennines, is undoubtedly of great weight; yet I obſerve, 1. That the long winter, of which Mura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori takes advantage, is to be found only in the Latin verſion, and not in the Greek text of Herodian. 2. That the viciſſitude of ſuns and rains, to which the ſoldiers of Maximin were expoſed (Herodian, l. viii. p. 277.), denotes the ſpring rather than the ſummer. We may obſerve likewiſe, that theſe ſeveral ſtreams, as they melted into one, compoſed the Timavus, ſo poetically (in every ſenſe of the word) deſcribed by Virgil. They are about twelve miles to the eaſt of Aquileia. See Cluyer. Italia Antiqua, tom. i. p. 189, &amp;c.</note>, oppoſed an unexpected obſtacle to the arms of Maximin. At length, on a ſingular bridge, conſtructed with art and difficulty, of large hogſheads, he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his army to the oppoſite bank, rooted up the beautiful vineyards in the neighbourhood of Aquileia, demoliſhed the ſuburbs, and employed the timber of the buildings in the engines and towers, with which on every ſide he attacked the city. The walls, fallen to decay during the ſecurity of a long peace, had been haſtily repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this ſudden emergency; but the firmeſt defence of Aquileia conſiſted in the conſtancy of the citizens; all ranks of whom, inſtead of being diſmayed, were animated by the extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and their knowledge of the tyrant's unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temper. Their courage was ſupported and directed by Criſpinus and Menophilus, two of the twenty lieutenants of the ſenate, who, with a ſmall body of regular troops, had thrown themſelves into the beſieged place. The army of Maximin was repulſed on repeated attacks, his machines

            <p>The emperor Maximus, who had advanced as <note place="margin">Conduct of Maximus.</note> far as Ravenna, to ſecure that important place, and to haſten the military preparations, beheld the event of the war in the more faithful mirror of reaſon and policy.

Some troops newly levied among the generous but enervated youth of Italy; and a body of German auxiliaries, on whoſe firmneſs, in the hour of trial, it was dangerous to depend. In the midſt of theſe juſt alarms, the ſtroke of domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy puniſhed the crimes of Maximin, and delivered Rome and the ſenate from the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that would ſurely have attended the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of an enraged barbarian.</p>

A ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of deſpair and diſaffection began to diffuſe itſelf among the troops; and as they were cut off from all intelligence, they eaſily believed that the whole empire had embraced the cauſe of the ſenate, and that they were left as devoted vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims to periſh under the impregnable walls of Aquileia. The fierce temper of the tyrant was exaſperated by diſappointments, which he imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the cowardice of his army; and his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and ill-timed cruelty, inſtead of ſtriking terror, inſpired hatred and a juſt deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.

his colleague and young Gordian went out to meet him, and the three princes made their entry into the capital, attended by the ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of almoſt all the cities of Italy, ſaluted with the ſplendid offerings of gratitude and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and received with the unfeigned acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſenate and people, who perſuaded themſelves that a golden age would ſucceed to an age of iron <note n="38" place="bottom">See the congratulatory letter of Claudius Julianus the conſul, to the two emperors, in the Auguſtan Hiſtory.</note>.

The oppreſſive taxes with which Maximin had loaded the rights of inheritance and ſucceſſion, were repealed, or at leaſt moderated.

Whilſt Maximus was preparing to defend Italy againſt the common foe, Balbinus, who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Sedition at Rome.</note> at Rome, had been engaged in ſcenes of blood and inteſtine diſcord. Diſtruſt and jealouſy reigned in the ſenate; and even in the temples where they aſſembled, every ſenator carried either open or concealed arms. In the midſt of their deliberations, two veterans of the guards, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated either by curioſity or a ſiniſter motive, auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly thruſt themſelves into the houſe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by degrees beyond the altar of Victory. Gallicanus, a conſular, and Maecenas, a Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſenator, viewed with indignation their inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent intruſion: drawing their daggers, they laid the ſpies, for ſuch they deemed them, dead at the foot of the altar, and then advancing to the door of the ſenate, imprudently exhorted the multitude to maſſacre the Praetorians, as the ſecret adherents of the tyrant. Thoſe who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the firſt fury of the tumult took refuge in the camp, which they defended with ſuperior advantage againſt the reiterated attacks of the people, aſſiſted by the numerous bands of gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, the property of opulent nobles. The civil war laſted many days, with infinite loſs and confuſion on both ſides. When the pipes were broken that ſupplied the camp with water, the Praetorians were reduced to intolerable diſtreſs; but in their turn they made deſperate ſallies into the city, ſet fire to a great number of houſes, and filled the ſtreets with the blood of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. The emperor Balbinus attempted, by ineffectual edicts and precarious truces, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0034700101:327"/>
the factions at Rome. But their animoſity, though ſmothered for a while, burnt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled violence. The ſoldiers, deteſting the ſenate and the people, deſpiſed the weakneſs of a prince who wanted either the ſpirit or the power to command the obedience of his ſubjects <note n="40" place="bottom">Herodian, l. viii. p. 258.</note>.</p>
            <p>After the tyrant's death, his formidable army <note place="margin">Diſcontent of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian guards.</note> had acknowledged, from neceſſity rather than from choice, the authority of Maximus, who tranſported himſelf without delay to the camp before Aquileia. As ſoon as he had received their oath of fidelity, he addreſſed them in terms full of mildneſs and moderation; lamented, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than arraigned, the wild diſorders of the times, and aſſured the ſoldiers, that of all their paſt conduct, the ſenate would remember only their generous deſertion of the tyrant, and their voluntary return to their duty. Maximus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced his exhortations by a liberal donative, purified the camp by a ſolemn ſacrifice of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then diſmiſſed the legions to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral provinces, impreſſed, as he hoped, with a lively ſenſe of gratitude and obedience <note n="41" place="bottom">Herodian, l. viii. p. 213.</note>. But nothing could reconcile the haughty ſpirit of the Praetorians. They attended the emperors on the memorable day of their public entry into Rome; but amidſt the general acclamations, the ſullen dejected countenance of the guards, ſufficiently declared that they conſidered themſelves as the object, rather than the partners, of the triumph. When the whole body was united in their camp, thoſe who had ſerved under Maximin, and thoſe
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0034700101:328"/>
who had remained at Rome, inſenſibly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to each other their complaints and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. The emperors choſen by the army had periſhed with ignominy; thoſe elected by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate were ſeated on the throne <note n="42" place="bottom">The obſervation had been made imprudently enough in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of the ſenate, and with regard to the ſoldiers it carried the appearance of a wanton inſult.

The long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between the civil and military powers was decided by a war, in which the former had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a complete victory. The ſoldiers muſt now learn a new doctrine of ſubmiſſion to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and whatever clemency was affected by that politic aſſembly, they dreaded a ſlow revenge, coloured by the name of diſcipline, and juſtified by fair pretences of the public good. But their fate was ſtill in their own hands; and if they had courage to deſpiſe the vain terrors of an impotent republic, it was eaſy to convince the world, that thoſe who were maſters of the arms, were maſters of the authority, of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>When the ſenate elected two princes, it is <note place="margin">Maſſacre of Maximus and Balbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> probable that, beſides the declared reaſon of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the various emergencies of peace and war, they were actuated by the ſecret deſire of weakening by diviſion the deſpotiſm of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme magiſtrate. Their policy was effectual, but it proved fatal both to their emperors and to themſelves. The jealouſy of power was ſoon exaſperated by the difference of character. Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus deſpiſed Balbinus as a luxurious noble, and was in his turn diſdained by his colleague as an

The whole city was employed in the Capitoline games, and the emperors were left almoſt alone in the palace. On a ſudden they were alarmed <note place="margin">A. D. 238.

The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the guards put an end to the vain ſtrife. They ſeized on theſe emperors of the ſenate, for ſuch they called them with mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious contempt, ſtripped them of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and dragged them in inſolent triumph through the ſtreets of Rome, with a deſign of inflicting a ſlow and cruel death on theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate princes.

In the ſpace of a few months, ſix princes had been cut off by the ſword.

They carried him to the camp, and unanimouſly ſaluted him Auguſtus and Emperor. His name was dear to the ſenate and people; his tender age promiſed a long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity of military licence; and the ſubmiſſion of Rome and the provinces to the choice of the Praetorian guards, ſaved the republic, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence indeed of its freedom and dignity, from the horrors of a new civil war in the heart of the capital <note n="46" place="bottom">Quintus Curtius (l. x. c. 9.) pays an elegant compliment to the emperor of the day, for having, by his happy acceſſion, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed ſo many firebrands, ſheathed ſo many ſwords, and put an end to the evils of a divided government. After weighing with attention every word of the paſſage, I am of opinion, that it ſuits better with the elevation of Gordian, than with any other period of the Roman Hiſtory.

            <p>As the third Gordian was only nineteen years <note place="margin">Innocence and virtues of Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</note> of age at the time of his death, the hiſtory of his life, were it known to us with greater accuracy than it really is, would contain little more than the account of his education, and the conduct of the miniſters, who by turns abuſed or guided the ſimplicity of his unexperienced youth. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his acceſſion, he fell into the hands of

We are ignorant by what fortunate acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the emperor eſcaped from this ignominious ſlavery, and devolved his confidence on a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, whoſe wiſe counſels had no object except the glory of his ſovereign, and the happineſs of the people.

And although the armies had no regular place or forms of aſſembly; though their debates were ſhort, their action ſudden, and their reſolves ſeldom the reſult of cool re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, did they not diſpoſe, with abſolute ſway, of the public fortune?

Slaves and ſtrangers were excluded from any participation in theſe national cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. A chorus of twenty-ſeven youths, and as many virgins, of noble families, and whoſe parents were both alive, implored the propitious gods in favour of the preſent, and for the hope

            <p>Since Romulus, with a ſmall band of ſhepherds <note place="margin">Decline of the Roman empire.</note> and outlaws, fortified himſelf on the hills near the Tiber, ten centuries had already elapſed <note n="59" place="bottom">The received calculation of Varro aſſigns to the foundation of Rome, an aera that correſponds with the 754th year before Chriſt. But ſo little is the chronology of Rome to be depended on, in the more early ages, that Sir Iſaac Newton has brought the ſame event as low as the year 627.</note>. During the four firſt ages, the Romans, in the laborious ſchool of poverty, had acquired the virtues of war and government: By the vigorous exertion of thoſe virtues, and by the aſſiſtance of fortune, they had obtained, in the courſe of the three ſucceeding centuries, an abſolute empire over many countries of Europe, Aſia, and Africa. The laſt three hundred years had been conſumed in apparent proſperity and internal decline. The nation of ſoldiers, magiſtrates, and legiſlators, who compoſed the thrity-five tribes of the Roman people, was diſſolved into the common maſs of mankind, and confounded with the millions of ſervile provincials, who had received the name,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0034700101:338"/>
without adopting the ſpirit of Romans. A mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary army, levied among the ſubjects and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians of the frontier, was the only order of men who preſerved and abuſed their independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. By their tumultuary election, a Syrian, a Goth, or an Arab, was exalted to the throne of Rome, and inveſted with deſpotic power over the conqueſts and over the country of the Scipios.</p>
            <p>The limits of the Roman empire ſtill extended from the Weſtern Ocean to the Tigris, and from Mount Atlas to the Rhine and the Danube. To the undiſcerning eye of the vulgar, Philip ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a monarch no leſs powerful than Hadrian or Auguſtus had formerly been. The form was ſtill the ſame, but the animating health and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour were fled. The induſtry of the people was diſcouraged and exhauſted by a long ſeries of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. The diſcipline of the legions, which alone, after the extinction of every other virtue, had propped the greatneſs of the ſtate, was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the ambition, or relaxed by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of the emperors. The ſtrength of the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, which had always conſiſted in arms rather than in fortifications, was inſenſibly undermined; and the faireſt provinces were left expoſed to the rapaciouſneſs or ambition of the barbarians, who ſoon diſcovered the decline of the Roman empire.</p>

            <p>WHENEVER Tacitus indulges himſelf in thoſe beautiful epiſodes, in which he relates ſome domeſtic tranſaction of the Germans <note place="margin">The bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians of the Eaſt and of the North.</note> or of the Parthians, his principal object is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the attention of the reader from a uniform ſcene of vice and miſery. From the reign of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus to the time of Alexander Severus, the enemies of Rome were in her boſom; the tyrants, and the ſoldiers; and her proſperity had a very diſtant and feeble intereſt in the revolutions that might happen beyond the Rhine and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates. But when the military order had le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, in wild anarchy, the power of the prince, the laws of the ſenate, and even the diſcipline of the camp, the barbarians of the north and of the eaſt, who had long hovered on the frontier, boldly attacked the provinces of a declining mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Their vexatious inroads were changed into formidable irruptions, and, after a long vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude of mutual calamities, many tribes of the victorious invaders eſtabliſhed themſelves in the provinces of the Roman empire. To obtain a clearer knowledge of theſe great events, we ſhall endeavour to form a previous idea of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, forces, and deſigns of thoſe nations who avenged the cauſe of Hannibal and Mithridates.</p>

In the more early ages of the world, whilſt the foreſt that covered Europe afforded a retreat to a few wandering ſavages, the inhabitants of Aſia <note place="margin">Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Aſia.</note> were already collected into populous cities, and reduced under extenſive empires, the ſeat of the arts, of luxury, and of deſpotiſm. The Aſſyrians reigned over the eaſt <note n="1" place="bottom">An ancient chronologiſt quoted by Velleius Paterculus (l. i. c. 6.) obſerves, that the Aſſyrians, the Medes, the Perſians, and the Macedonians, reigned over Aſia one thouſand nine hundred and ninety-five years, from the acceſſion of Ninus to the defeat of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus by the Romans. As the latter of theſe great events hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened 289 years before Chriſt, the former may be placed 2184 years before the ſame aera. The Aſtronomical Obſervations, found at Babylon by Alexander, went fifty years higher.</note>, till the ſceptre of Ninus and Semiramis dropt from the hands of their enervated ſucceſſors. The Medes and the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians divided their power, and were themſelves ſwallowed up in the monarchy of the Perſians, whoſe arms could not be confined within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits of Aſia. Followed, as it is ſaid, by two millions of <hi>men,</hi> Xerxes, the deſcendant of Cyrus, invaded Greece. Thirty thouſand <hi>ſoldiers,</hi> under the command of Alexander, the ſon of Philip, who was intruſted by the Greeks with their glory and revenge, were ſufficient to ſubdue Perſia. The princes of the houſe of Seleucus uſurped and loſt the Macedonian command over the Eaſt. About the ſame time, that, by an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious treaty, they reſigned to the Romans the country on this ſide Mount Taurus, they were driven by the Parthians, an obſcure horde of Scythian origin, from all the provinces of Upper Aſia. The formidable power of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0034700101:341"/>
which ſpread from India to the frontiers of Syria, was in its turn ſubverted by Ardſhir, or Artaxerxes; the founder of a new dynaſty, which, under the name of Saſſanides, governed Perſia till the invaſion of the Arabs. This great revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe fatal influence was ſoon experienced by the Romans, happened in the fourth year of Alexander Severus, two hundred and twenty-ſix years after the Chriſtian aera <note n="2" place="bottom">In the five hundred and thirty-eighth year of the aera of Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus. See Agathias, l. ii. p. 63. This great event (ſuch is the careleſſneſs of the Orientals) is placed by Eutychius, as high as the tenth year of Commodus, and by Moſes of Chorene, as low as the reign of Philip. Ammianus Marcellinus has ſo ſervilely copied (xxiii. 6.) his ancient materials, which are indeed very good, that he deſcribes the family of the Arſacides, as ſtill ſeated on the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian throne in the middle of the fourth century.</note>.</p>
            <p>Artaxerxes had ſerved with great reputation in <note place="margin">The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes.</note> the armies of Artaban, the laſt king of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, and it appears that he was driven into exile and rebellion by royal ingratitude, the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary reward for ſuperior merit. His birth was obſcure, and the obſcurity equally gave room to the aſperſions of his enemies, and the flattery of his adherents.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0034700101:343"/>
and corrupted each other's ſuperſtitions. The Arſacides, indeed, practiſed the worſhip of the Magi; but they diſgraced and polluted it with a various mixture of foreign idolatry. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Zoroaſter, the ancient prophet and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher of the Perſians <note n="7" place="bottom">Hyde and Prideaux, working up the Perſian legends and their own conjectures into a very agreeable ſtory, repreſent Zoroaſter as a contemporary of Darius Hyſtaſpes. But it is ſufficient to obſerve, that the Greek writers, who lived almoſt in the age of Darius, agree in placing the aera of Zoroaſter many hundred, or even thouſand, years before their own time. The judicious criticiſm of Mr. Moyle perceived, and maintained againſt his uncle Dr. Prideaux, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the Perſian prophet. See his work, vol. ii.</note>, was ſtill revered in the Eaſt; but the obſolete and myſterious language, in which the Zendaveſta was compoſed <note n="8" place="bottom">That ancient idiom was called the <hi>Zend.</hi> The language of the commentary, the Pehlvi, though much more modern, has ceaſed many ages ago to be a living tongue. This fact alone (if it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as authentic) ſufficiently warrants the antiquity of thoſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which M. d'Anquetil has brought into Europe, and tranſlated into French.</note>, opened a field of diſpute to ſeventy ſects, who variouſly explained the fundamental doctrines of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and were all indifferently derided by a crowd of infidels, who rejected the divine miſſion and miracles of the prophet. To ſuppreſs the idolaters, reunite the ſchiſmatics, and confute the unbelievers, by the infallible deciſion of a general council, the pious Artaxerxes ſummoned the Magi from all parts of his dominions. Theſe prieſts, who had ſo long ſighed in contempt and obſcurity, obeyed the welcome ſummons; and on the appointed day appeared, to the number of about eighty thouſand. But as the debates of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0034700101:344"/>
ſo tumultuous an aſſembly could not have been directed by the authority of reaſon, or influenced by the art of policy, the Perſian ſynod was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by ſucceſſive operations, to forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, to four thouſand, to four hundred, to forty, and at laſt to ſeven Magi, the moſt reſpected for their learning and piety. One of theſe, Erdavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raph, a young but holy prelate, received from the hands of his brethren three cups of ſopori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous wine. He drank them off, and inſtantly fell into a long and profound ſleep. As ſoon as he waked, he related to the king and to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving multitude, his journey to Heaven, and his intimate conferences with the Deity. Every doubt was ſilenced by this ſupernatural evidence; and the articles of the faith of Zoroaſter were fixed with equal authority and preciſion <note n="9" place="bottom">Hyde de Religione veterum Perſ. c. 21.</note>. A ſhort delineation of that celebrated ſyſtem will be found uſeful, not only to diſplay the character of the Perſian nation, but to illuſtrate many of their moſt important tranſactions, both in peace and war, with the Roman empire <note n="10" place="bottom">I have principally drawn this account from the Zendaveſta of M. d'Anquetil, and the Sadder, ſubjoined to Dr. Hyde's treatiſe. It muſt, however, be confeſſed, that the ſtudied obſcurity of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the figurative ſtyle of the Eaſt, and the deceitful medium of a French or Latin verſion, may have betrayed us into error and hereſy, in this abridgement of Perſian theology.</note>.</p>
            <p>The great and fundamental article of the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, <note place="margin">Perſian theology; two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> was the celebrated doctrine of the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; a bold and injudicious attempt of Eaſtern philoſophy to reconcile the exiſtence of moral
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0034700101:345"/>
and phyſical evil, with the attributes of a benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Creator and Governor of the world. The firſt and original Being, in whom, or by whom, the univerſe exiſts, is denominated in the writings of Zoroaſter, <hi>Time without bounds;</hi> but it muſt be confeſſed, that this infinite ſubſtance ſeems rather a metaphyſical abſtraction of the mind, than a real object endowed with ſelf-conſciouſneſs, or poſſeſſed of moral perfections. From either the blind, or the intelligent operation of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Time, which bears but too near an affinity with the chaos of the Greeks, the two ſecondary but active principles of the univerſe, were from all eternity produced, Ormuſd and Ahriman, each of them poſſeſſed of the powers of creation, but each diſpoſed, by his invariable nature, to exerciſe them with different deſigns. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of good is eternally abſorbed in light; the principle of evil eternally buried in darkneſs. The wiſe benevolence of Ormuſd formed man capable of virtue, and abundantly provided his fair habitation with the materials of happineſs. By his vigilant providence, the motion of the planets, the order of the ſeaſons, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate mixture of the elements, are preſerved. But the malice of Ahriman has long ſince pierced <hi>Ormuſd's egg;</hi> or, in other words, has violated the harmony of his works. Since that fatal ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the moſt minute articles of good and evil are intimately intermingled and agitated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the rankeſt poiſons ſpring up amidſt the moſt ſalutary plants; deluges, earthquakes, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0034700101:346"/>
conflagrations, atteſt the conflict of Nature, and the little world of man is perpetually ſhaken by vice and misfortune. Whilſt the reſt of human kind are led away captives in the chains of their infernal enemy, the faithful Perſian alone reſerves his religious adoration for his friend and protector Ormuſd, and fights under his banner of light, in the full confidence that he ſhall, in the laſt day, ſhare the glory of his triumph. At that deciſive period, the enlightened wiſdom of goodneſs will render the power of Ormuſd ſuperior to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious malice of his rival. Ahriman and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, diſarmed and ſubdued, will ſink into their native darkneſs; and virtue will maintain the eternal peace and harmony of the univerſe <note n="11" place="bottom">The modern Perſees (and in ſome degree the Sadder) exalt Ormuſd into the firſt and omnipotent cauſe, whilſt they degrade Ahriman into an inferior but rebellious ſpirit. Their deſire of pleaſing the Mahometans may have contributed to refine their theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical ſyſtem.</note>.</p>
            <p>The theology of Zoroaſter was darkly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <note place="margin">Religious worſhip.</note> by foreigners, and even by the far greater number of his diſciples; but the moſt careleſs obſervers were ſtruck with the philoſophic ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Perſian worſhip. <q>That people, ſays Herodotus <note n="12" place="bottom">Herodotus, l. i. c. 131. But Dr. Prideaux thinks, with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the uſe of temples was afterwards permitted in the Magian religion.</note>, rejects the uſe of temples, of altars, and of ſtatues, and ſmiles at the folly of thoſe nations, who imagine that the gods are ſprung from, or bear any affinity with, the human nature. The tops of the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

are the places choſen for ſacrifices. Hymns and prayers are the principal worſhip; the Supreme God who fills the wide circle of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is the object to whom they are addreſſed.</q> Yet, at the ſame time, in the true ſpirit of a polytheiſt, he accuſes them of adoring Earth, Water, Fire, the Winds, and the Sun and Moon. But the Perſians of every age have denied the charge, and explained the equivocal conduct, which might appear to give a colour to it. The elements, and more particularly Fire, Light, and the Sun, whom they called Mithra, were the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their religious reverence, becauſe they conſidered them as the pureſt ſymbols, the nobleſt productions, and the moſt powerful agents of the Divine Power and Nature <note n="13" place="bottom">Hyde de Relig. Perſ. c. 8. Notwithſtanding all their diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and proteſtations, which ſeem ſincere enough, their tyrants, the Mahometans, have conſtantly ſtigmatiſed them, as idolatrous worſhippers of the Fire.</note>.</p>
            <p>Every mode of religion, to make a deep and laſting impreſſion on the human mind, muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe <note place="margin">Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</note> our obedience, by enjoining practices of devotion, for which we can aſſign no reaſon; and muſt acquire our eſteem, by inculcating moral duties analogous to the dictates of our own hearts. The religion of Zoroaſter was abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with the former, and poſſeſſed a ſufficient portion of the latter. At the age of puberty, the faithful Perſian was inveſted with a myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous girdle, the badge of the divine protection; and from that moment, all the actions of his life, even the moſt indifferent, or the moſt neceſſary,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0034700101:348"/>
were ſanctified by their peculiar prayers, ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or genuflexions; the omiſſion of which, under any circumſtances, was a grievous ſin, not inferior in guilt to the violation of the moral duties. The moral duties, however, of juſtice, mercy, liberality, &amp;c. were in their turn requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the diſciple of Zoroaſter, who wiſhed to eſcape the perſecution of Ahriman, and to live with Ormuſd in a bliſsful eternity, where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of felicity will be exactly proportioned to the degree of virtue and piety <note n="14" place="bottom">See the Sadder, the ſmalleſt part of which conſiſts of moral precepts. The ceremonies enjoined are infinite and trifling. Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen genuflexions, prayers, &amp;c. were required whenever the devout Perſian cut his nails or made water; or as often as he put on the ſacred girdle. Sadder, Art. 14. 50. 60.</note>.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome remarkable inſtances, in <note place="margin">Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> which Zoroaſter lays aſide the prophet, aſſumes the legiſlator, and diſcovers a liberal concern for private and public happineſs, ſeldom to be found among the groveling or viſionary ſchemes of ſuperſtition. Faſting and celibacy, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon means of purchaſing the Divine favour, he condemns with abhorrence, as a criminal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the beſt gifts of Providence. The ſaint, in the Magian religion, is obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get children, to plant uſeful trees, to deſtroy noxious animals, to convey water to the dry lands of Perſia, and to work out his ſalvation by purſuing all the labours of agriculture. We may quote from the Zendaveſta a wiſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent maxim, which compenſates for many an abſurdity. <q>He who ſows the ground with

During the period that elapſed from the acceſſion of Marcus to the reign of Alexander, the Roman and the Parthian empires were twice engaged in war; and although the whole ſtrength of the Arſacides contended with a part only of the forces of Rome, the event was moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in favour of the latter.

Many ages after the fall of their empire, Seleucia retained the genuine characters of a Grecian colony, arts, military virtue, and the love of freedom.

The army of the Great King conſiſted of one hundred and twenty thouſand horſe, clothed in complete armour of ſteel; of ſeven hundred ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, with towers filled with archers on their backs, and of eighteen hundred chariots, armed with ſcythes.

In the vaſt army of Tigranes, which was vanquiſhed by Lucullus, ſeventeen thouſand horſe only were completely armed. Antiochus brought fifty-four elephants into the field againſt the Romans: by his frequent wars and negociations with the princes of India, he had once collected an hundred and fifty of thoſe great animals; but it may be queſtioned, whether the moſt powerful monarch of Hindoſtan ever formed a line of battle of ſeven hundred elephants. Inſtead of three or four thouſand elephants, which the Great Mogul was ſuppoſed to poſſeſs, Tavernier (Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, part ii. l. i. p. 198.) diſcovered, by a more accurate inquiry, that he had only five hundred for his baggage, and eighty or ninety for the ſervice of war. The Greeks have varied with regard to the number which Porus brought into the field: but Quintus Curtius (viii. 13.), in this inſtance judicious and moderate, is contented with eighty-five elephants, diſtinguiſhed by their ſize and ſtrength. In Siam, where theſe animals are the moſt numerous and the moſt eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eighteen elephants are allowed as a ſufficient proportion for each of the nine brigades into which a juſt army is divided.

The behaviour of Artaxerxes had been very different. Flying with rapidity from the hills of Media to the marſhes of the Euphrates, he had every where oppoſed the invaders in perſon; and in either fortune, had united with the ableſt conduct the moſt undaunted reſolution. But in ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate engagements againſt the veteran legions of Rome, the Perſian monarch had loſt the flower of his troops. Even his victories had weakened his power.

            </head>
            <p>THE government and religion of Perſia have deſerved ſome notice from their connexion with the decline and fall of the Roman empire. We ſhall occaſionally mention the Scythian, or Sarmatian tribes, which, with their arms and horſes, their flocks and herds, their wives and families, wandered over the immenſe plains which ſpread themſelves from the Caſpian Sea to the Viſtula, from the confines of Perſia to thoſe of Germany. But the warlike Germans, who firſt reſiſted, then invaded, and at length overturned, the weſtern monarchy of Rome, will occupy a much more important place in this hiſtory, and poſſeſs a ſtronger, and, if we may uſe the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a more domeſtic, claim to our attention and regard. The moſt civilized nations of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Europe iſſued from the woods of Germany, and in the rude inſtitutions of thoſe barbarians we may ſtill diſtinguiſh the original principles of our preſent laws and manners. In their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate of ſimplicity and independence, the Germans were ſurveyed by the diſcerning eye, and delineated by the maſterly pencil, of Tacitus, the firſt of hiſtorians who applied the ſcience of philoſophy to the ſtudy of facts. The expreſſive conciſeneſs of his deſcriptions has deſerved to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0034700101:369"/>
the diligence of innumerable antiquarians, and to excite the genius and penetration of the philoſophic hiſtorians of our own times. The ſubject, however various and important, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been ſo frequently, ſo ably, and ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcuſſed, that it is now grown familiar to the reader, and difficult to the writer. We ſhall therefore content ourſelves with obſerving, and indeed with repeating, ſome of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant circumſtances of climate, of manners, and of inſtitutions, which rendered the wild barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of Germany ſuch formidable enemies to the Roman power.</p>
            <p>Ancient Germany, excluding from its inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent <note place="margin">Extent of Germany.</note> limits the province weſtward of the Rhine, which had ſubmitted to the Roman yoke, extended itſelf over a third part of Europe. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole of modern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Livonia, Pruſſia, and the greater part of Poland, were peopled by the various tribes of one great nation, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, manners, and language denoted a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon origin, and preſerved a ſtriking reſemblance. On the weſt, ancient Germany was divided by the Rhine from the Gallic, and on the ſouth, by the Danube, from the Illyrian provinces of the empire. A ridge of hills, riſing from the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube, and called the Carpathian Mountains, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Germany on the ſide of Dacia or Hungary. The eaſtern frontier was faintly marked by the mutual fears of the Germans and the Sarmatians, and was often confounded by the mixture of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and confederating tribes of the two nations.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0034700101:370"/>
In the remote darkneſs of the north, the ancients imperfectly deſcried a frozen ocean that lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Baltic Sea, and beyond the Peninſula, or iſlands <note n="1" place="bottom">The modern philoſophers of Sweden ſeem agreed that the waters of the Baltic gradually ſink in a regular proportion, which they have ventured to eſtimate at half an inch every year. Twenty cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies ago, the flat country of Scandinavia muſt have been covered by the ſea; while the high lands roſe above the waters, as ſo many iſlands of various forms and dimenſions. Such indeed is the notion given us by Mela, Pliny, and Tacitus, of the vaſt countries round the Baltic. See in the Bibliotheque Raiſonnéc, tom. xl. and xlv. a large abſtract of Dalin's Hiſtory of Sweden, compoſed in the Swediſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> of Scandinavia.</p>
            <p>Some ingenious writers <note n="2" place="bottom">In particular, Mr. Hume, the Abbé du Bos, and M. Pellou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, Hiſt. des Celtes, tom. i.</note> have ſuſpected that Europe was much colder formerly than it is at <note place="margin">Climate.</note> preſent; and the moſt ancient deſcriptions of the climate of Germany tend exceedingly to confirm their theory. The general complaints of intenſe froſt, and eternal winter, are perhaps little to be regarded, ſince we have no method of reducing to the accurate ſtandard of the thermometer, the feelings, or the expreſſions of an orator, born in the happier regions of Greece or Aſia. But I ſhall ſelect two remarkable circumſtances of a leſs equivocal nature. 1. The great rivers which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Roman provinces, the Rhine and the Danube, were frequently frozen over, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſupporting the moſt enormous weights. The barbarians, who often choſe that ſevere ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their inroads, tranſported, without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion or danger, their numerous armies, their

The rein deer, that uſeful animal, from whom the ſavage of the North derives the beſt comforts of his dreary life, is of a conſtitution that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and even requires, the moſt intenſe cold. He is found on the rock of Spitzberg, within ten degrees of the Pole; he ſeems to delight in the ſnows of Lapland and Siberia; but at preſent he cannot ſubſiſt, much leſs multiply, in any country to the ſouth of the Baltic <note n="4" place="bottom">Buffon Hiſtoire Naturelle, tom. xii. p. 79. 116.</note>. In the time of Caeſar, the rein deer, as well as the elk, and the wild bull, was a native of the Hercynian foreſt, which then overſhadowed a great part of Germany and Poland <note n="5" place="bottom">Caeſar de Bell. Gallic. vi. 23, &amp;c. The moſt inquiſitive of the Germans were ignorant of its utmoſt limits, although ſome of them had travelled in it more than ſixty days journey.</note>.

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0034700101:372"/>

The rein deer are very numerous, the ground is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with deep and laſting ſnow, and the great river of St Lawrence is regularly frozen, in a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when the waters of the Seine and the Thames are uſually free from ice <note n="7" place="bottom">Charlevoix Hiſtoire du Canada.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to aſcertain, and eaſy to exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the influence of the climate of ancient Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <note place="margin">Its effects on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> over the minds and bodies of the natives. Many writers have ſuppoſed, and moſt have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, though, as it ſhould ſeem, without any adequate proof, that the rigorous cold of the North was favourable to long life and generative vigour, that the women were more fruitful, and the human ſpecies more prolific, than in warmer or more temperate climates <note n="8" place="bottom">Olaus Rudbeck aſſerts that the Swediſh women often bear ten or twelve children, and not uncommonly twenty or thirty; but the authority of Rudbeck is much to be ſuſpected.</note>. We may aſſert, with greater confidence, that the keen air of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many formed the large and maſculine limbs of the natives, who were, in general, of a more lofty ſtature than the people of the South <note n="9" place="bottom">In hos artus, in haec corpora, quae miramur, excreſcunt.

The ſeverity of a winter cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,

that chilled the courage of the Roman troops, was ſcarcely felt by theſe hardy children of the North <note n="10" place="bottom">Plutarch. in Mario.

When Tacitus conſidered the purity of the German blood, and the forbidding aſpect of the country, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to pronounce thoſe barbarians <hi>Indigenae,</hi> or natives of the ſoil.

            <p>Such rational doubt is but ill-ſuited with the <note place="margin">Fables and conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> genius of popular vanity. Among the nations who have adopted the Moſaic hiſtory of the world, the ark of Noah has been of the ſame uſe, as was formerly to the Greeks and Romans the ſiege of Troy. On a narrow baſis of acknowledged truth, an immenſe but rude ſuperſtructure of fable has been erected; and the wild Iriſhman <note n="13" place="bottom">According to Dr. Keating (Hiſtory of Ireland, p. 13, 14.), the giant Partholanus, who was the ſon of Seara, the ſon of Eſra, the ſon of Sru, the ſon of Framant, the ſon of Fathaclan, the ſon of Magog, the ſon of Japhet, the ſon of Noah, landed on the coaſt of Munſter, the 14th day of May, in the year of the world one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand nine hundred and ſeventy-eight. Though he ſucceeded in his great enterpriſe, the looſe behaviour of his wife rendered his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life very unhappy, and provoked him to ſuch a degree, that he killed—her favourite greyhound.

Bayle has given two moſt curious extracts from it. Republique des Lettres Janvier et Fevrier, 1685.</note>. Whatever is celebrated either in hiſtory or fable, this zealous patriot aſcribes to his country. From Sweden (which formed ſo conſiderable a part of ancient Germany) the Greeks themſelves derived their alphabetical cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, their aſtronomy, and their religion. Of that delightful region (for ſuch it appeared to the eyes of a native) the Atlantis of Plato, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Hyperboreans, the gardens of the Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perides, the Fortunate Iſlands, and even the Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Fields, were all but faint and imperfect tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts. A clime ſo profuſely favoured by Nature, could not long remain deſert after the flood. The learned Rudbeck allows the family of Noah a few years to multiply from eight to about twenty thouſand perſons. He then diſperſes them into ſmall colonies to repleniſh the earth, and to propagate the human ſpecies. The German or Swediſh detachment (which marched, if I am not miſtaken, under the command of Aſkenaz the ſon of Gomer, the ſon of Japhet) diſtinguiſhed itſelf by a more than common diligence in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this great work.

But Tacitus aſſerts, as a well-known fact, that the Germans, in his time, had <hi>no</hi> cities <note n="20" place="bottom">Tacit.

The game of various ſorts, with which the foreſts of Germany were plentifully ſtocked, ſupplied its inhabitants
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0034700101:379"/>
with food and exerciſe <note n="25" place="bottom">Tacit. Germ. 5.</note>. Their monſtrous herds of cattle, leſs remarkable indeed for their beauty than for their utility <note n="26" place="bottom">Caeſar de Bell.

A ſmall quantity of corn was the only produce exacted from the earth: the uſe of orchards or artificial meadows was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Germans; nor can we expect any improvements in agriculture from a people, whoſe property every year experienced a general change by a new diviſion of the arable lands, and who, in that ſtrange operation, avoided diſputes, by ſuffering a great part of their territory to lie waſte and without tillage <note n="27" place="bottom">Tacit.

            <p>Gold, ſilver, and iron, were extremely ſcarce in Germany.

Sweden, which now ſupplies Europe with iron, was equally ignorant of its own riches; and the appearance of the arms of the Germans furniſhed a ſufficient proof how little iron they were able to beſtow on what they muſt have deemed the nobleſt uſe of that metal. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tranſactions of peace and war had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome Roman coins (chiefly ſilver) among the borderers of the Rhine and Danube; but the more diſtant tribes were abſolutely unacquainted with the uſe of money, carried on their confined traffic by the exchange of commodities, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0034700101:380"/>
prized their rude earthen veſſels as of equal value with the ſilver vaſes, the preſents of Rome to their princes and ambaſſadors <note n="28" place="bottom">Tacit. Germ. 6.</note>. To a mind ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reflection, ſuch leading facts convey more inſtruction, than a tedious detail of ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate circumſtances. The value of money has been ſettled by general conſent to expreſs our wants and our property; as letters were invented to expreſs our ideas; and both theſe inſtitutions, by giving a more active energy to the powers and paſſions of human nature, have contributed to multiply the objects they were deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. The uſe of gold and ſilver is in a great meaſure factitious; but it would be impoſſible to enumerate the important and various ſervices which agriculture, and all the arts, have received from iron, when tempered and faſhioned by the operation of fire, and the dexterous hand of man. Money, in a word, is the moſt univerſal incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, iron the moſt powerful inſtrument, of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man induſtry; and it is very difficult to conceive by what means a people, neither actuated by the one, nor ſeconded by the other, could emerge from the groſſeſt barbariſm <note n="29" place="bottom">It is ſaid that the Mexicans and Peruvians, without the uſe of either money or iron, had made a very great progreſs in the arts.

            <p>If we contemplate a ſavage nation in any part <note place="margin">Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence.</note> of the globe, a ſupine indolence and a careleſſneſs of futurity will be found to conſtitute their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character. In a civilized ſtate, every faculty
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0034700101:381"/>
of man is expanded and exerciſed; and the great chain of mutual dependence connects and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces the ſeveral members of ſociety. The moſt numerous portion of it is employed in conſtant and uſeful labour. The ſelect few, placed by fortune above that neceſſity, can, however, fill up their time by the purſuits of intereſt or glory, by the improvement of their eſtate or of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, by the duties, the pleaſures, and even the follies of ſocial life. The Germans were not poſſeſſed of theſe varied reſources. The care of the houſe and family, the management of the land and cattle, were delegated to the old and the infirm, to women and ſlaves. The lazy war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, deſtitute of every art that might employ his leiſure hours, conſumed his days and nights in the animal gratifications of ſleep and food. And yet, by a wonderful diverſity of Nature (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the remark of a writer who had pierced into its darkeſt receſſes), the ſame barbarians are by turns the moſt indolent and the moſt reſtleſs of mankind. They delight in ſloth, they deteſt tranquillity <note n="30" place="bottom">Tacit. Germ. 15.</note>. The languid ſoul, oppreſſed with its own weight, anxiouſly required ſome new and powerful ſenſation; and war and danger were the only amuſements adequate to its fierce temper. The ſound that ſummoned the German to arms was grateful to his ear. It rouſed him from his uncomfortable lethargy, gave him an active pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and, by ſtrong exerciſe of the body, and violent emotions of the mind, reſtored him to a
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0034700101:382"/>
more lively ſenſe of his exiſtence. In the dull intervals of peace, theſe barbarians were immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately addicted to deep gaming and exceſſive drinking; both of which, by different means, the one by inflaming their paſſions, the other by extinguiſhing their reaſon, alike relieved them from the pain of thinking. They gloried in paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole days and nights at table; and the blood of friends and relations often ſtained their numerous and drunken aſſemblies <note n="31" place="bottom">Tacit. Germ. 22, 23.</note>. Their debts of honour (for in that light they have tranſmitted to us thoſe of play) they diſcharged with the moſt romantic fidelity. The deſperate gameſter, who had ſtaked his perſon and liberty on a laſt throw of the dice, patiently ſubmitted to the deciſion of fortune, and ſuffered himſelf to be bound, chaſtiſed, and ſold into remote ſlavery, by his weaker but more lucky antagoniſt <note n="32" place="bottom">Id. 24.

            <p>Strong beer, a liquor extracted with very little art from wheat or barley, and <hi>corrupted</hi> (as it is <note place="margin">Their taſte for ſtrong liquors.</note> ſtrongly expreſſed by Tacitus) into a certain ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of wine, was ſufficient for the groſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of German debauchery. But thoſe who had taſted the rich wines of Italy, and afterwards of Gaul, ſighed for that more delicious ſpecies of intoxication. They attempted not, however (as has ſince been executed with ſo much ſucceſs), to naturalize the vine on the banks of the Rhine and Danube; nor did they endeavour to procure
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0034700101:383"/>
by induſtry the materials of an advantageous commerce. To ſolicit by labour what might be raviſhed by arms, was eſteemed unworthy of the German ſpirit <note n="33" place="bottom">Tacit. Germ. 14.</note>. The intemperate thirſt of ſtrong liquors often urged the barbarians to invade the provinces on which art or nature had beſtowed thoſe much envied preſents. The Tuſcan who betrayed his country to the Celtic nations, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted them into Italy by the proſpect of the rich fruits and delicious wines, the productions of a happier climate <note n="34" place="bottom">Plutarch. in Camillo.

The innumerable ſwarms that iſſued, or ſeemed to iſſue, from the great ſtorehouſe of nations, were multiplied by the fears of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, and by the credulity of ſucceeding ages. And from facts thus exaggerated, an opinion was gradually eſtabliſhed, and has been ſupported by writers of diſtinguiſhed reputation, that, in the age of Caeſar and Tacitus, the inhabitants of the North were far more numerous than they are in

by what means riches and deſpotiſm could pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into a remote corner of the North, and extinguiſh the generous flame that blazed with ſuch fierceneſs on the frontier of the Roman provinces: or how the anceſtors of thoſe Danes and Norwegians, ſo diſtinguiſhed in latter ages by their unconquered ſpirit, could thus tamely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the great character of German liberty <note n="42" place="bottom">May we not ſuſpect that ſuperſtition was the parent of deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm?

Some tribes, however, on the coaſt of the Baltic, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the authority of kings, though without relinquiſhing the rights of men <note n="43" place="bottom">Tacit. Germ. c. 43.</note>; but in the far greater part of Germany, the form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a democracy, tempered indeed, and controlled, not ſo much by general and poſitive laws, as by the occaſional aſcendant of birth or valour, of eloquence or ſuperſtition <note n="44" place="bottom">Id. c. 11, 12, 13, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>Civil governments, in their firſt inſtitutions, are <note place="margin">Aſſemblies of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> voluntary aſſociations for mutual defence. To obtain the deſired end, it is abſolutely neceſſary, that each individual ſhould conceive himſelf obliged to ſubmit his private opinion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the judgment of the greater number of his aſſociates. The German tribes were content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this rude but liberal outline of political ſociety. As ſoon as a youth, born of free pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, had attained the age of manhood, he was
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0034700101:387"/>
introduced into the general council of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, ſolemnly inveſted with a ſhield and ſpear, and adopted as an equal and worthy member of the military commonwealth. The aſſembly of the warriors of the tribe was convened at ſtated ſeaſons, or on ſudden emergencies. The trial of public offences, the election of magiſtrates, and the great buſineſs of peace and war, were determined by its independent voice. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, indeed, theſe important queſtions were previouſly conſidered, and prepared in a more ſelect council of the principal chieftains <note n="45" place="bottom">Grotius changes an expreſſion of Tacitus, <hi>pertractantur</hi> into <hi>praetractantur.</hi> The correction is equally juſt and ingenious.</note>. The magiſtrates might deliberate and perſuade, the people only could reſolve and execute; and the reſolutions of the Germans were for the moſt part haſty and violent. Barbarians accuſtomed to place their freedom in gratifying the preſent paſſion, and their courage in overlooking all future conſequences, turned away with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant contempt from the remonſtrances of juſtice and policy, and it was the practice to ſignify by a hollow murmur, their diſlike of ſuch timid counſels. But whenever a more popular orator propoſed to vindicate the meaneſt citizen from either foreign or domeſtic injury, whenever he called upon his fellow-countrymen to aſſert the national honour, or to purſue ſome enterpriſe full of danger and glory, a loud claſhing of ſhields and ſpears expreſſed the eager applauſe of the aſſembly. For the Germans always met
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0034700101:388"/>
in arms, and it was conſtantly to be dreaded; leſt an irregular multitude, inflamed with faction and ſtrong liquors, ſhould uſe thoſe arms to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, as well as to declare, their furious reſolves. We may recollect how often the diets of Poland have been polluted with blood, and the more numerous party has been compelled to yield to the more violent and ſeditious <note n="46" place="bottom">Even in <hi>our</hi> ancient parliament, the barons often carried a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not ſo much by the number of votes, as by that of their armed followers.</note>.</p>
            <p>A general of the tribe was elected on occaſions <note place="margin">Authority of the princes and magiſtrates</note> of danger; and, if the danger was preſſing and extenſive, ſeveral tribes concurred in the choice of the ſame general. The braveſt warrior was named to lead his countrymen into the field, by his example rather than by his commands. But this power, however limited, was ſtill invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. It expired with the war, and in time of peace the German tribes acknowledged not any ſupreme chief <note n="47" place="bottom">Caeſar de Bell.

In the choice of theſe magiſtrates, as much regard was ſhewn to birth as to merit <note n="49" place="bottom">Reges ex nobilitate, duces ex virtute ſumunt. Tacit. Germ. 7.</note>. To each was aſſigned, by the public, a guard, and a council of an hundred perſons; and the firſt of the princes appears to have enjoyed a pre-eminence of rank and honour

which ſometimes tempted the Romans to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment him with the regal title <note n="50" place="bottom">Cluver. Germ. Ant. l. i. c. 38.</note>.</p>
            <p>The comparative view of the powers of the <note place="margin">more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute over the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Germans.</note> magiſtrates, in two remarkable inſtances, is alone ſufficient to repreſent the whole ſyſtem of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man manners. The diſpoſal of the landed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty within their diſtrict, was abſolutely veſted in their hands, and they diſtributed it every year according to a new diviſion <note n="51" place="bottom">Caeſar, vi. 22. Tacit. Germ. 26.</note>. At the ſame time they were not authorized to puniſh with death, to impriſon, or even to ſtrike, a private citizen <note n="52" place="bottom">Tacit. Germ. 7.</note>. A people thus jealous of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and careleſs of their poſſeſſions, muſt have been totally deſtitute of induſtry and the arts, but animated with a high ſenſe of honour and independence.</p>
            <p>The Germans reſpected only thoſe duties which <note place="margin">Voluntary engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> they impoſed on themſelves. The moſt obſcure ſoldier reſiſted with diſdain the authority of the magiſtrates. <q>The nobleſt youths bluſhed not to be numbered among the faithful compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of ſome renowned chief, to whom they devoted their arms and ſervice. A noble emulation prevailed among the companions to obtain the firſt place in the eſteem of their chief; amongſt the chiefs to acquire the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number of valiant companions. To be ever ſurrounded by a band of ſelect youths, was the pride and ſtrength of the chiefs, their ornament in peace, their defence in war. The
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0034700101:390"/>
glory of ſuch diſtinguiſhed heroes diffuſed itſelf beyond the narrow limits of their own tribe. Preſents and embaſſies ſolicited their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the fame of their arms often enſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed victory to the party which they eſpouſed. In the hour of danger it was ſhameful for the chief to be ſurpaſſed in valour by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; ſhameful for the companions not to equal the valour of their chief. To ſurvive his fall in battle, was indelible infamy. To protect his perſon, and to adorn his glory with the trophies of their own exploits, were the moſt ſacred of their duties. The chiefs combated for victory, the companions for the chief. The nobleſt warriors, whenever their native country was ſunk in the lazineſs of peace, maintained their numerous bands in ſome diſtant ſcene of action, to exerciſe their reſtleſs ſpirit, and to acquire renown by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary dangers. Gifts worthy of ſoldiers, the warlike ſteed, the bloody and ever victorious lance, were the rewards which the companions claimed from the liberality of their chief. The rude plenty of his hoſpitable board was the only pay that <hi>he</hi> could beſtow, or <hi>they</hi> would accept. War, rapine, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will offerings of his friends, ſupplied the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of this munificence <note n="53" place="bottom">Tacit.

them all the virtues of which barbarians are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible; the faith and valour, the hoſpitality and the courteſy, ſo conſpicuous long afterwards in the ages of chivalry. The honourable gifts, beſtowed by the chief on his brave companions, have been ſuppoſed, by an ingenious writer, to contain the firſt rudiments of the fiefs, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, after the conqueſt of the Roman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, by the barbarian lords among their vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, with a ſimilar duty of homage and military ſervice <note n="54" place="bottom">Eſprit des Loix, l. xxx. c. 3.

            <p>Although the progreſs of civilization has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <note place="margin">Its proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſes.</note> contributed to aſſuage the fiercer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of human nature, it ſeems to have been leſs favourable to the virtue of chaſtity, whoſe moſt dangerous enemy is the ſoftneſs of the mind. The refinements of life corrupt while they poliſh the intercourſe of the ſexes. The groſs appetite of love becomes moſt dangerous when it is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, or rather, indeed, diſguiſed by ſentimental paſſion. The elegance of dreſs, of motion, and of manners, gives a luſtre to beauty, and inflames the ſenſes through the imagination. Luxurious entertainments, midnight dances, and licentious ſpectacles, preſent at once temptation and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to female frailty <note n="57" place="bottom">Ovid employs two hundred lines in the reſearch of places the moſt favourable to love. Above all, he conſiders the theatre as the beſt adapted to collect the beauties of Rome, and to melt them into tenderneſs and ſenſuality.</note>. From ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the unpoliſhed wives of the barbarians were ſecured, by poverty, ſolitude, and the painful cares of a domeſtic life. The German huts, open, on every ſide, to the eye of indiſcretion or
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0034700101:393"/>
jealouſy, were a better ſafeguard of conjugal fidelity, than the walls, the bolts, and the eunuchs of a Perſian haram. To this reaſon, another may be added of a more honourable nature. The Germans treated their women with eſteem and confidence, conſulted them on every occaſion of importance, and fondly believed, that in their breaſts reſided a ſanctity and wiſdom, more than human. Some of theſe interpreters of fate, ſuch as Velleda, in the Batavian war, governed in the name of the deity, the fierceſt nations of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <note n="58" place="bottom">Tacit. Hiſt. iv. 61. 65.</note>. The reſt of the ſex, without being adored as goddeſſes, were reſpected as the free and equal companions of ſoldiers; aſſociated even by the marriage ceremony to a life of toil, of danger, and of glory <note n="59" place="bottom">The marriage preſent was a yoke of oxen, horſes, and arms. See Germ. c. 18. Tacitus is ſomewhat too florid on the ſubject.</note>. In their great inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the camps of the barbarians were filled with a multitude of women, who remained firm and undaunted amidſt the ſound of arms, the various forms of deſtruction, and the honourable wounds of their ſons and huſbands <note n="60" place="bottom">The change of <hi>exigere</hi> into <hi>exugere</hi> is a moſt excellent correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>. Fainting armies of Germans have more than once been driven back upon the enemy, by the generous deſpair of the women, who dreaded death much leſs than ſervitude. If the day was irrecoverably loſt, they well knew how to deliver themſelves and their children, with their own hands, from

The ſentiments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of theſe high-ſpirited matrons may, at once, be conſidered as a cauſe, as an effect, and as a proof of the general character of the nation.

            <p>The religious ſyſtem of the Germans (if the <note place="margin">Religion.</note> wild opinions of ſavages can deſerve that name) was dictated by their wants, their fears, and their ignorance <note n="62" place="bottom">Tacitus has employed a few lines, and Cluverius one hundred and twenty-four pages, on this obſcure ſubject.

They adored the great viſible objects and agents of Nature, the Sun and the

Moon, the Fire and the Earth; together with thoſe imaginary deities, who were ſuppoſed to preſide over the moſt important occupations of human life. They were perſuaded, that, by ſome ridiculous arts of divination, they could diſcover the will of the ſuperior beings, and that human ſacrifices were the moſt precious and acceptable offering to their altars. Some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe has been haſtily beſtowed on the ſublime notion, entertained by that people, of the Deity, whom they neither confined within the walls of a temple, nor repreſented by any human figure; but when we recollect, that the Germans were unſkilled in architecture, and totally unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the art of ſculpture, we ſhall readily aſſign the true reaſon of a ſcruple, which aroſe not ſo much from a ſuperiority of reaſon, as from a want of ingenuity. The only temples in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many were dark and ancient groves, conſecrated by the reverence of ſucceeding generations. Their ſecret gloom, the imagined reſidence of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible power, by preſenting no diſtinct object of fear or worſhip, impreſſed the mind with a ſtill deeper ſenſe of religious horror <note n="63" place="bottom">The ſacred wood, deſcribed with ſuch ſublime horror by Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, was in the neighbourhood of Marſeilles; but there were many of the ſame kind in Germany.</note>; and the prieſts, rude and illiterate as they were, had been taught by experience the uſe of every artifice that could preſerve and fortify impreſſions ſo well ſuited to their own intereſt.</p>

The ſame ignorance, which renders barbarians incapable of conceiving or embracing the uſeful reſtraints of laws, expoſes them naked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed <note place="margin">Its effects in peace,</note> to the blind terrors of ſuperſtition. The German prieſts, improving this favourable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their countrymen, had aſſumed a juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, even in temporal concerns, which the magiſtrate could not venture to exerciſe; and the haughty warrior patiently ſubmitted to the laſh of correction, when it was inflicted, not by any human power, but by the immediate order of the god of war <note n="64" place="bottom">Tacit.

            <p>But the influence of religion was far more <note place="margin">in war.</note> powerful to inflame, than to moderate, the fierce paſſions of the Germans. Intereſt and fanaticiſm often prompted its miniſters to ſanctify the moſt daring and the moſt unjuſt enterpriſes, by the approbation of Heaven, and full aſſurances of ſucceſs. The conſecrated ſtandards, long rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the groves of ſuperſtition, were placed in the front of the battle <note n="67" place="bottom">Tacit. Germ. c. 7.

The immortality ſo vainly promiſed by the prieſts, was, in ſome degree conferred by the bards. That ſingular order of men has moſt <note place="margin">The bards.</note> deſervedly attracted the notice of all who have attempted to inveſtigate the antiquities of the Celts, the Scandinavians, and the Germans. Their genius and character, as well as the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence paid to that important office, have been ſufficiently illuſtrated. But we cannot ſo eaſily expreſs, or even conceive, the enthuſiaſm of arms and glory, which they kindled in the breaſt of their audience. Among a poliſhed people, a taſte for poetry is rather an amuſement of the fancy, than a paſſion of the ſoul. And yet, when in calm retirement we peruſe the combats deſcribed by Homer or Taſſo, we are inſenſibly ſeduced by the fiction, and feel a momentary glow of martial ardour. But how faint, how cold is the ſenſation which a peaceful mind can receive from ſolitary ſtudy! It was in the hour of battle, or in the feaſt of victory, that the bards celebrated the glory of heroes of ancient days, the anceſtors of thoſe warlike chieftains, who liſtened with tranſport to their artleſs but animated ſtrains. The view of arms and of danger heightened the effect of the military ſong; and the paſſions which it tended to excite, the deſire of fame, and the contempt of death, were the habitual ſentiments of a German mind <note n="71" place="bottom">See Tacit.

And yet we find, that, during more than two hundred and fifty years that elapſed from the defeat of Varus to the reign of Decius, theſe formidable barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians made few conſiderable attempts, and not any material impreſſion on the luxurious and enſlaved provinces of the empire.

Their military dreſs, when they wore any, was nothing more than a looſe mantle. A variety of colours was the only ornament of their wooden or oſier ſhields. Few of the chiefs were diſtinguiſhed by cuiraſſes, ſcarce any by helmets. Though the horſes of Germany were neither beautiful, ſwift, nor prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the ſkilful evolutions of the Roman ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, ſeveral of the nations obtained renown by their cavalry; but, in general, the principal ſtrength of the Germans conſiſted in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <note n="73" place="bottom">It was their principal diſtinction from the Sarmatians, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally fought on horſeback.</note>, which was drawn up in ſeveral deep co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, according to the diſtinction of tribes and families.

But as the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians poured forth their whole ſouls on the firſt onſet, they knew not how to rally or to retire. A repulſe was a ſure defeat; and a defeat was moſt commonly total deſtruction. When we
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0034700101:401"/>
recollect the complete armour of the Roman ſoldiers, their diſcipline, exerciſes, evolutions, fortified camps, and military engines, it appears a juſt matter of ſurpriſe how the naked and unaſſiſted valour of the barbarians could dare to encounter in the field, the ſtrength of the legions, and the various troops of the auxiliaries, which ſeconded their operations. The conteſt was too unequal, till the introduction of luxury had ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated the vigour, and a ſpirit of diſobedience and ſedition had relaxed the diſcipline, of the Roman armies. The introduction of barbarian auxiliaries into thoſe armies, was a meaſure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with very obvious dangers, as it might gradually inſtruct the Germans in the arts of war and of policy. Although they were admitted in ſmall numbers and with the ſtricteſt precaution, the example of Civilis was proper to convince the Romans, that the danger was not imaginary, and that their precautions were not always ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note n="74" place="bottom">The relation of this enterpriſe occupies a great part of the fourth and fifth books of the Hiſtory of Tacitus, and is more remarkable for its eloquence than perſpicuity.

The wide extent of country might very poſſibly contain a million of warriors, as all who were of age to bear arms were of a temper to uſe them. But this fierce multitude, incapable of concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or executing any plan of national greatneſs, was agitated by various and often hoſtile inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Germany was divided into more than forty independent ſtates; and even in each ſtate the union of the ſeveral tribes was extremely looſe and precarious. The barbarians were eaſily provoked; they knew not how to forgive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, much leſs an inſult; their reſentments were bloody and implacable.

Chiefs of renown and power were flattered by the moſt trifling preſents, which they received either as marks of diſtinction, or as the inſtruments of luxury. In civil diſſentions, the weaker faction endeavoured to ſtrengthen its intereſt by entering into ſecret connexions with the governors of the frontier provinces.

A. D. 248—268.</note> misfortune. During that calamitous period, every inſtant of time was marked, every province of the Roman world was afflicted, by barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders and military tyrants, and the ruined em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ſeemed to approach the laſt and fatal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its diſſolution. The confuſion of the times, and the ſcarcity of authentic memorials, oppoſe equal difficulties to the hiſtorian, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to preſerve a clear and unbroken thread of narration. Surrounded with imperfect frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, always conciſe, often obſcure, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contradictory, he is reduced to collect, to compare, and to conjecture: and though he ought never to place his conjectures in the rank of facts, yet the knowledge of human nature, and of the ſure operation of its fierce and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained paſſions, might, on ſome occaſions, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of hiſtorical materials.</p>
            <p>There is not, for inſtance, any difficulty in conceiving, that the ſucceſſive murders of ſo <note place="margin">The empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Philip.</note> many emperors had looſened all the ties of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance between the prince and people; that all
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0034700101:409"/>
the generals of Philip were diſpoſed to imitate the example of their maſter; and that the caprice of armies, long ſince habituated to frequent and violent revolutions, might every day raiſe to the throne the moſt obſcure of their fellow-ſoldiers. Hiſtory can only add, that the rebellion againſt the emperor Philip broke out in the ſummer of the year two hundred and forty-nine, among the legions of Maeſia; and that a ſubaltern officer <note n="1" place="bottom">The expreſſion uſed by Zoſimus and Zonaras may ſignify that Marinus commanded a century, a cohort, or a legion.</note>, named Marinus, was the object of their ſeditious choice. Philip was alarmed. He dreaded leſt the treaſon of the Maeſian army ſhould prove the firſt ſpark of a general conflagration. Diſtracted with the conſciouſneſs of his guilt and of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he communicated the intelligence to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. A gloomy ſilence prevailed, the effect of fear, and perhaps of diſaffection: till at length <note place="margin">Services, revolt, vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and reign of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Decius. A. D. 249.</note> Decius, one of the aſſembly, aſſuming a ſpirit worthy of his noble extraction, ventured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover more intrepidity than the emperor ſeemed to poſſeſs. He treated the whole buſineſs with contempt, as a haſty and inconſiderate tumult, and Philip's rival as a phantom of royalty, who in a very few days would be deſtroyed by the ſame inconſtancy that had created him. The ſpeedy completion of the prophecy inſpired Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip with a juſt eſteem for ſo able a counſellor; and Decius appeared to him the only perſon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reſtoring peace and diſcipline to an army, whoſe tumultuous ſpirit did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0034700101:410"/>
ſubſide after the murder of Marinus. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, who long reſiſted his own nomination, ſeems to have inſinuated the danger of preſenting a leader of merit, to the angry and apprehenſive minds of the ſoldiers; and his prediction was again confirmed by the event. The legions of Maeſia forced their judge to become their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice. They left him only the alternative of death or the purple. His ſubſequent conduct, after that deciſive meaſure, was unavoidable. He conducted, or followed, his army to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Italy, whither Philip, collecting all his force to repel the formidable competitor whom he had raiſed up, advanced to meet him. The Imperial troops were ſuperior in number <note n="2" place="bottom">His birth at Bubalia, a little village in Pannonia (Eutrop. ix. Victor. in Caeſarib. et Epitom.), ſeems to contradict, unleſs it was merely accidental, his ſuppoſed deſcent from the Decii. Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years had beſtowed nobility on the Decii; but at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of that period, they were only Plebeians of merit, and among the firſt who ſhared the conſulſhip with the haughty Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. Plebeiae Deciorum animae, &amp;c. Juvenal, Sat. viii. 254. See the ſpirited ſpeech of Decius, in Livy, x. 9, 10.</note>; but the rebels formed an army of veterans, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by an able and experienced leader. Philip was either killed in the battle, or put to death a few days afterwards at Verona. His ſon and aſſociate in the empire was maſſacred at Rome by the Praetorian guards; and the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Decius, with more favourable circumſtances than the ambition of that age can uſually plead, was univerſally acknowledged by the ſenate and provinces. It is reported, that, immediately after his reluctant acceptance of the title of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0034700101:411"/>
he had aſſured Philip by a private meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, of his innocence and loyalty, ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting, that, on his arrival in Italy, he would reſign the Imperial ornaments, and return to the condition of an obedient ſubject. His profeſſions might be ſincere. But in the ſituation where fortune had placed him, it was ſcarcely poſſible that he could either forgive or be forgiven <note n="3" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. i. p. 20. Zonaras, l. xii. p. 624. Edit.

            <p>The emperor Decius had employed a few <note place="margin">He march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es againſt the Goths. A. D. 250.</note> months in the works of peace and the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice, when he was ſummoned to the banks of the Danube by the invaſion of the GOTHS. This is the firſt conſiderable occaſion in which hiſtory mentions that great people, who afterwards broke the Roman power, ſacked the Capitol, and reigned in Gaul, Spain, and Italy. So memorable was the part which they acted in the ſubverſion of the Weſtern empire, that the name of GOTHS is frequently but improperly uſed as a general appellation of rude and warlike bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the ſixth century, and after <note place="margin">Origin of the Goths from Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinavia.</note> the conqueſt of Italy, the Goths, in poſſeſſion of preſent greatneſs, very naturally indulged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the proſpect of paſt and of future glory. They wiſhed to preſerve the memory of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and to tranſmit to poſterity their own at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements. The principal miniſter of the court of Ravenna, the learned Caſſiodorus, gratified the inclination of the conquerors in a Gothic hiſtory, which conſiſted of twelve books, now reduced to

the imperfect abridgment of Jornandes <note n="4" place="bottom">See the prefaces of Caſſiodorus and Jornandes: it is ſurpriſing that the latter ſhould be omitted in the excellent edition publiſhed by Grotius, of the Gothic writers.</note>. Theſe writers paſſed with the moſt artful conciſeneſs over the misfortunes of the nation, celebrated its ſucceſsful valour, and adorned the triumph with many Aſiatic trophies, that more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the people of Scythia. On the faith of ancient ſongs, the uncertain, but the only, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of barbarians, they deduced the firſt origin of the Goths, from the vaſt iſland, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninſula, of Scandinavia <note n="5" place="bottom">On the authority of Ablavius, Jornandes quotes ſome old Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic chronicles in verſe.

That extreme country of the North was not unknown to the conquerors of Italy; the ties of ancient conſanguinity had been ſtrengthened by recent offices of friendſhip; and a Scandinavian king had cheerfully abdicated his ſavage greatneſs, that he might paſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his days in the peaceful and poliſhed court of Ravenna <note n="6" place="bottom">Jornandes, c. 3.</note>. Many veſtiges, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſcribed to the arts of popular vanity, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the ancient reſidence of the Goths in the countries beyond the Baltic. From the time of the geographer Ptolemy, the ſouthern part of Sweden ſeems to have continued in the poſſeſſion of the leſs enterpriſing remnant of the nation, and a large territory is even at preſent divided into eaſt and weſt Gothland.

The Swedes, who might well be ſatisfied with their own fame in arms, have, in every age, claimed the kindred glory of the Goths.

            <p>Till the end of the eleventh century, a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <note place="margin">Religion of the Goths.</note> temple ſubſiſted at Upſal, the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable town of the Swedes and Goths. It was enriched with the gold which the Scandinavians had acquired in their piratical adventures, and ſanctified by the uncouth repreſentations of the three principal deities, the god of war, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of generation, and the god of thunder. In the general feſtival, that was ſolemnized every ninth year, nine animals of every ſpecies (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excepting the human) were ſacrificed, and their bleeding bodies ſuſpended in the ſacred grove adjacent to the temple <note n="9" place="bottom">See Adam of Bremen in Grotii Prolegomenis, p. 104.

that now ſubſiſt of this barbaric ſuperſtition are contained in the Edda, a ſyſtem of mythology, compiled in Iceland about the thirteenth century, and ſtudied by the learned of Denmark and Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as the moſt valuable remains of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient traditions.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the myſterious obſcurity of <note place="margin">Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and death of Odin.</note> the Edda, we can eaſily diſtinguiſh two perſons confounded under the name of Odin; the god of war, and the great legiſlator of Scandinavia. The latter, the Mahomet of the north, inſtituted a religion adapted to the climate and to the people. Numerous tribes on either ſide of the Baltic were ſubdued by the invincible valour of Odin, by his perſuaſive eloquence, and by the fame, which he acquired, of a moſt ſkilful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician. The faith that he had propagated; dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long and proſperous life, he confirmed by a voluntary death. Apprehenſive of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious approach of diſeaſe and infirmity, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to expire as became a warrior. In a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn aſſembly of the Swedes and Goths, he wounded himſelf in nine mortal places, haſtening away (as he aſſerted with his dying voice) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the feaſt of heroes in the palace of the god of war <note n="10" place="bottom">Mallet, Introduction à l'Hiſtoire du Dannemarc.</note>.</p>
            <p>The native and proper habitation of Odin is <note place="margin">Agreeable but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Odin.</note> diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of As-gard.

or As-of <note n="11" place="bottom">Mallet, c. iv. p. 55, has collected from Strabo, Pliny, Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy, and Stephanus Byzantinus, the veſtiges of ſuch a city and people.</note>, words of a ſimilar ſignification, has given riſe to an hiſtorical ſyſtem of ſo pleaſing a contexture, that we could almoſt wiſh to perſuade ourſelves of its truth. It is ſuppoſed that Odin was the chief of a tribe of barbarians which dwelt on the banks of the lake Maeotis, till the fall of Mithridates and the arms of Pompey menaced the north with ſervitude. That Odin, yielding with indignant fury to a power which he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſiſt, conducted his tribe from the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the Aſiatic Sarmatia into Sweden, with the great deſign of forming, in that inacceſſible retreat of freedom, a religion and a people, which, in ſome remote age, might be ſubſervient to his immortal revenge; when his invincible Goths, armed with martial fanaticiſm, ſhould iſſue in numerous ſwarms from the neighbourhood of the Polar circle, to chaſtiſe the oppreſſors of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <note n="12" place="bottom">This wonderful expedition of Odin, which, by deducing the enmity of the Goths and Romans from ſo memorable a cauſe, might ſupply the noble groundwork of an Epic poem, cannot ſafely be received as authentic hiſtory. According to the obvious ſenſe of the Edda, and the interpretation of the moſt ſkilful critics, As-gard, inſtead of denoting a real city of the Aſiatic Sarmatia, is the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious appellation of the myſtic abode of the gods, the Olympus of Scandinavia; from whence the prophet was ſuppoſed to deſcend, when he announced his new religion to the Gothic nations, who were already ſeated in the ſouthern parts of Sweden.</note>.</p>
            <p>If ſo many ſucceſſive generations of Goths were <note place="margin">Emigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goths from Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinavia into Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</note> capable of preſerving a faint tradition of their Scandinavian origin, we muſt not expect, from

ſuch unlettered barbarians, any diſtinct account of the time and circumſtances of their emigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To croſs the Baltic was an eaſy and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural attempt. The inhabitants of Sweden were maſters of a ſufficient number of large veſſels, with oars <note n="13" place="bottom">Tacit. Germania, c. 44.</note>, and the diſtance is little more than one hundred miles from Carlſcroon to the neareſt ports of Pomerania and Pruſſia. Here, at length, we land on firm and hiſtoric ground. At leaſt as early as the Chriſtian aera <note n="14" place="bottom">Tacit. Annal. ii. 62. If we could yield a firm aſſent to the navigations of Pytheas of Marſeilles, we muſt allow that the Goths had paſſed the Baltic at leaſt three hundred years before Chriſt.</note>, and as late as the age of the Antonines <note n="15" place="bottom">Ptolemy, l. ii.</note>, the Goths were eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the mouth of the Viſtula, and in that fertile province where the commercial cities of Thorn, Elbing, Koningſberg, and Dantzick were long afterwards founded <note n="16" place="bottom">By the German colonies who followed the arms of the Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonic knights. The conqueſt and converſion of Pruſſia were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted by thoſe adventurers in the xiiith century.</note>. Weſtward of the Goths, the numerous tribes of the Vandals were ſpread along the banks of the Oder, and the ſea-coaſt of Pomerania and Mecklenburgh. A ſtriking reſemblance of manners, complexion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and language, ſeemed to indicate that the Vandals and the Goths were originally one great people <note n="17" place="bottom">Pliny (Hiſt.

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0034700101:417"/>
into Oſtrogoths, Viſigoths, and Gepidae <note n="18" place="bottom">The <hi>Oſtro</hi> and <hi>Viſi,</hi> the eaſtern and weſtern Goths obtained thoſe denominations from their original ſeats in Scandinavia. In all their future marches and ſettlements they preſerved, with their names, the ſame relative ſituation. When they firſt departed from Sweden, the infant colony was contained in three veſſels. The third being a heavy ſailer lagged behind, and the crew, which afterwards ſwelled into a nation, received from that circumſtance the appellation of Gepidae or Loiterers. Jornandes, c. 17.</note>. The diſtinction among the Vandals was more ſtrongly marked by the independent names of Heruli, Burgundians, Lombards, and a variety of other petty ſtates, many of which, in a future age, expanded themſelves into powerful monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies.</p>
            <p>In the age of the Antonines, the Goths were <note place="margin">From Pruſſia to the Uk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine.</note> ſtill ſeated in Pruſſia. About the reign of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Severus, the Roman province of Dacia had already experienced their proximity by frequent and deſtructive inroads <note n="19" place="bottom">See a fragment of Peter Patricius in the Excerpta Legationum; and with regard to its probable date, ſee Tillemont, Hiſt. des Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereurs, tom. iii. p. 346.</note>. In this interval, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of about ſeventy years, we muſt place the ſecond migration of the Goths from the Baltic to the Euxine; but the cauſe that produced it lies concealed among the various motives which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the conduct of unſettled barbarians. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a peſtilence, or a famine, a victory, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, an oracle of the Gods, or the eloquence of a daring leader, were ſufficient to impel the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic arms on the milder climates of the ſouth. Beſides the influence of a martial religion, the numbers and ſpirit of the Goths were equal to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0034700101:418"/>
the moſt dangerous adventures. The uſe of round bucklers and ſhort ſwords rendered them formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a cloſe engagement; the manly obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which they yielded to hereditary kings, gave uncommon union and ſtability to their councils <note n="20" place="bottom">Omnium harum gentium inſigne, rotunda ſcuta, breves gladii, et erga reges obſequium.

            <p>The fame of a great enterpriſe excited the <note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic nation increaſes in its march.</note> braveſt warriors from all the Vandalic ſtates of Germany, many of whom are ſeen a few years afterwards combating under the common ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the Goths <note n="22" place="bottom">The Heruli, and the Uregundi or Burgundi, are particularly mentioned. See Maſcou's Hiſtory of the Germans, l. v. A paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 28, ſeems to allude to this great emigration. The Marcomannic war was partly occaſioned by the preſſure of barbarous tribes, who fled before the arms of more northern barbarians.</note>. The firſt motions of the emigrants carried them to the banks of the Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pec, a river univerſally conceived by the ancients to be the ſouthern branch of the Boryſthenes <note n="23" place="bottom">D'Anville, Geographie Ancienne, and the third part of his incomparable map of Europe.</note>. The windings of that great ſtream through the plains of Poland and Ruſſia gave a direction to their line of march, and a conſtant ſupply of freſh water and paſturage to their numerous herds of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0034700101:419"/>
cattle. They followed the unknown courſe of the river, confident in their valour, and careleſs of whatever power might oppoſe their progreſs. The Baſtarnae and the Venedi were the firſt who preſented themſelves; and the flower of their youth, either from choice or compulſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Gothic army. The Baſtarnae dwelt on the northern ſide of the Carpathian mountains; the immenſe tract of land that ſeparated the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarnae from the ſavages of Finland, was poſſeſſed, or rather waſted, by the Venedi <note n="24" place="bottom">Tacit.

The Scythian hords, which, towards the eaſt, bordered on the new ſettlements of the Goths, preſented nothing to their arms, except the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">The Goths invade the Roman provinces.</note> chance of an unprofitable victory. But the proſpect of the Roman territories was far more alluring; and the fields of Dacia were covered with rich harveſts, ſown by the hands of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, and expoſed to be gathered by thoſe of a warlike, people. It is probable, that the conqueſts of Trajan, maintained by his ſucceſſors, leſs for any real advantage, than for ideal dignity, had contributed to weaken the empire on that ſide. The new and unſettled province of Dacia was neither ſtrong enough to reſiſt, nor rich enough to ſatiate, the rapaciouſneſs of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. As long as the remote banks of the Nieſter were conſidered as the boundary of the Roman power, the fortifications of the Lower Danube were more careleſsly guarded, and the inhabitants of Maeſia lived in ſupine ſecurity, fondly conceiving themſelves at an inacceſſible diſtance from any barbarian invaders. The ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Goths, under the reign of Philip, fatally convinced them of their miſtake. The king, or leader of that ſierce nation, traverſed with contempt the province of Dacia, and paſſed both the Nieſter and the Danube without encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering any oppoſition capable of retarding his progreſs. The relaxed diſcipline of the Roman troops betrayed the moſt important poſts, where they were ſtationed, and the fear of deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment induced great numbers of them to inliſt

under the Gothic ſtandard. The various multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of barbarians appeared, at length, under the walls of Marcianopolis, a city built by Trajan in honour of his ſiſter, and at that time the capital of the ſecond Maeſia <note n="29" place="bottom">In the ſixteenth chapter of Jornandes, inſtead of <hi>ſecundo</hi> Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam, we may venture to ſubſtitute <hi>ſecundam,</hi> the ſecond Maeſia, of which Marcianopolis was certainly the capital (ſee Hierocles de Provinciis, and Weſſeling ad locum, p. 636.

Intelligence was ſoon tranſmitted to the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Decius, that Cniva, king of the Goths, had paſſed the Danube a ſecond time, with more conſiderable forces; that his numerous detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſcattered devaſtation over the province of Maeſia, whilſt the main body of the army, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſeventy thouſand Germans and Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, a force equal to the moſt daring atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, required the preſence of the Roman mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and the exertion of his military power.</p>

The barbarians were unexpectedly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, routed, chaſed, and purſued beyond the Danube.

He advanced to meet him as far as the plains of Spoleto. When the armies came in ſight of each other, the ſoldiers of Gallus compared the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious conduct of their ſovereign with the glory of his rival. They admired the valour of Aemilianus; they were attracted by his liberality,

He aſſured them, that he ſhould reſign to their wiſdom the civil adminiſtration; and, contenting himſelf with the quality of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, would in a ſhort time aſſert the glory of Rome, and deliver the empire from all the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians both of the North and of the Eaſt <note n="59" place="bottom">Zonaras, l. xii. p. 628.</note>.

The fleet of the Goths, leaving the coaſt of Circaſſia on the left hand, firſt appeared before Pityus <note n="105" place="bottom">Arrian places the frontier garriſon at Dioſcurias, or Sebaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, forty-four miles to the eaſt of Pityus.

They were repulſed; and their diſappointment ſeemed to diminiſh the terror of the Gothic name. As long as Succeſſianus, an officer of ſuperior rank and merit, defended that frontier, all their efforts were ineffectual; but as ſoon as he was removed by Valerian to a more honourable but leſs important ſtation, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the attack of Pityus; and, by the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that city, obliterated the memory of their former diſgrace <note n="106" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. i. p. 30.</note>.</p>

The city was large and populous; a double encloſure of walls ſeemed to defy the fury of the Goths, and the uſual garriſon had been ſtrengthened by a reinforcement of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. But there are not any advantages ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſupplying the abſence of diſcipline and vigilance. The numerous garriſon of Trebizond, diſſolved in riot and luxury, diſdained to guard their impregnable fortifications. The Goths ſoon diſcovered the ſupine negligence of the beſieged, erected a lofty pile of faſcines, aſcended the walls in the ſilence of the night, and entered the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs city, ſword in hand.

The garriſon of Chalcedon was encamped near the temple of Jupiter Urius, on a promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory that commanded the entrance of the Strait; and ſo inconſiderable were the dreaded invaſions of the barbarians, that this body of troops ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed in number the Gothic army. But it was <note place="margin">They plunder the cities of Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> in numbers alone that they ſurpaſſed it.

Whilſt they heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated whether they ſhould prefer the ſea or land, Europe or Aſia, for the ſcene of their hoſtilities, a perfidious fugitive pointed out Nicomedia, once the capital of the kings of Bithynia, as a rich and eaſy conqueſt.

Nice, Pruſa, Apaemaea, Cius, cities that had ſometimes rivalled, or imitated, the ſplendour of Nicomedia, were involved in the ſame calamity, which, in a few weeks, raged without controul through the whole province of Bithynia. Three hundred years of peace, enjoyed by the ſoft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Aſia, had aboliſhed the exerciſe of arms, and removed the apprehenſion of danger.

It was ſtill the ſeat of wealth and luxury; but of its ancient ſtrength, nothing remained except the ſituation, in a little iſland of the Propontis, connected with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of Aſia only by two bridges.

to deſtruction; but the ruin of Cyzicus was delayed by a fortunate accident. The ſeaſon was rainy, and the lake Apolloniates, the reſervoir of all the ſprings of Mount Olympus, roſe to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common height. The little river of Rhyndacus, which iſſues from the lake, ſwelled into a broad and rapid ſtream, and ſtopped the progreſs of the Goths. Their retreat to the maritime city of Heraclea, where the fleet had probably been ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was attended by a long train of waggons, laden with the ſpoils of Bithynia, and was marked by the flames of Nice and Nicodemia, which they wantonly burnt <note n="117" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. i. p. 33.</note>.

by the judicious Strabo <note n="121" place="bottom">Strabo, l. xi. p. 495.</note>, that the piratical veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels uſed by the barbarians of Pontus and the Leſſer Scythia, were not capable of containing more than twenty-five or thirty men, we may ſafely affirm, that fifteen thouſand warriors, at the moſt, embarked in this great expedition. Impatient of the limits of the Euxine, they ſteered their deſtructive courſe from the Cimmerian to the Thracian Boſphorus. When they had almoſt gained the middle of the Straits, they were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly driven back to the entrance of them; till <note place="margin">They paſs the Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus and the Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont,</note> a favourable wind ſpringing up the next day, carried them in a few hours into the placid ſea, or rather lake of the Propontis. Their landing on the little iſland of Cyzicus, was attended with the ruin of that ancient and noble city. From thence iſſuing again through the narrow paſſage of the Helleſpont, they purſued their winding navigation amidſt the numerous iſlands ſcattered over the Archipelago, or the Aegean Sea. The aſſiſtance of captives and deſerters muſt have been very neceſſary to pilot their veſſels, and to direct their various incurſions, as well on the coaſt of Greece as on that of Aſia. At length the Gothic fleet anchored in the port of Piraeus, five miles diſtant from Athens <note n="122" place="bottom">Plin. Hiſt.

Sylla. The efforts of his ſkill were ineffectual, and the barbarians became maſters of the native ſeat of the muſes and the arts. But while the conquerors abandoned themſelves to the licenſe of plunder and intemperance, their fleet, that lay with a ſlender guard in the harbour of Piraeus, was unexpectedly attacked by the brave Dexip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, who, flying with the engineer Cleodamus from the ſack of Athens, collected a haſty band of volunteers, peaſants as well as ſoldiers, and in ſome meaſure avenged the calamities of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <note n="123" place="bottom">Hiſt.

            <p>But this exploit, whatever luſtre it might ſhed on the declining age of Athens, ſerved rather to <note place="margin">ravage Greece, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Italy.</note> irritate than to ſubdue the undaunted ſpirit of the northern invaders. A general conflagration blazed out at the ſame time in every diſtrict of Greece. Thebes and Argos, Corinth and Sparta, which had formerly waged ſuch memorable wars againſt each other, were now unable to bring an army into the field, or even to defend their ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fortifications. The rage of war, both by land and by ſea, ſpread from the eaſtern point of Sunium to the weſtern coaſt of Epirus. The Goths had already advanced within ſight of Italy, when the approach of ſuch imminent danger awakened the indolent Gallienus from his dream of pleaſure. The emperor appeared in arms;
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:0034700101:455"/>
and his preſence ſeems to have checked the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and to have divided the ſtrength, of the enemy. Naulobatus, a chief of the Heruli, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted <note place="margin">Their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and retreat.</note> an honourable capitulation, entered with a large body of his countrymen into the ſervice of Rome, and was inveſted with the ornaments of the conſular dignity, which had never before been profaned by the hands of a barbarian <note n="124" place="bottom">Syncellus, p. 382. This body of Heruli was for a long time faithful and famous.</note>. Great numbers of the Goths, diſguſted with the perils and hardſhips of a tedious voyage, broke into Maeſia, with a deſign of forcing their way over the Danube to their ſettlements in the Ukraine. The wild attempt would have proved inevitable deſtruction, if the diſcord of the Roman generals had not opened to the barbarians the means of an eſcape <note n="125" place="bottom">Claudius, who commanded on the Danube, thought with propriety and acted with ſpirit. His colleague was jealous of his fame. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 181.</note>. The ſmall remainder of this deſtroying hoſt returned on board their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; and meaſuring back their way through the Helleſpont and the Boſphorus, ravaged in their paſſage the ſhores of Troy, whoſe fame, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talized by Homer, will probably ſurvive the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Gothic conqueſts. As ſoon as they found themſelves in ſafety within the baſon of the Euxine, they landed at Anchialus in Thrace, near the foot of Mount Haemus; and, after all their toils, indulged themſelves in the uſe of thoſe pleaſant and ſalutary hot baths. What remained

of the voyage was a ſhort and eaſy navigation <note n="126" place="bottom">Jornandes, c. 20.</note>. Such was the various fate of this third and greateſt of their naval enterpriſes. It may ſeem difficult to conceive, how the original body of fifteen thouſand warriors could ſuſtain the loſſes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of ſo bold an adventure. But as their numbers were gradually waſted by the ſword, by ſhipwrecks, and by the influence of a warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, they were pepetually renewed by troops of banditti and deſerters, who flocked to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of plunder, and by a crowd of fugitive ſlaves, often of German or Sarmatian extraction, who eagerly ſeized the glorious opportunity of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and revenge. In theſe expeditions, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic nation claimed a ſuperior ſhare of honour and danger; but the tribes that fought under the Gothic banners, are ſometimes diſtinguiſhed and ſometimes confounded in the imperfect hiſtories of that age; and as the barbarian fleets ſeemed to iſſue from the mouth of the Tanais, the vague but familiar appellation of Scythians was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently beſtowed on the mixt multitude <note n="127" place="bottom">Zoſimus and the Greeks (as the author of the Philopatris) give the name of Scythians to thoſe whom Jornandes, and the Latin writers, conſtantly repreſent as Goths.</note>.</p>

The arts of Greece, and the wealth of Aſia, had conſpired to erect that ſacred and magnificent ſtructure. It was ſupported by an hundred and twenty-ſeven marble columns of the Ionic order. They were the gifts of devout monarchs, and each was ſixty feet high. The altar was adorned with the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſculptures of Praxiteles, who had, perhaps, ſelected from the favourite legends of the place the birth of the divine children of Latona, the concealment of Apollo after the ſlaughter of the Cyclops, and the clemency of Bacchus to the vanquiſhed Amazons <note n="129" place="bottom">Strabo, l. xiv. p. 640.

Yet the length of the temple of Epheſus was only four hundred and twenty-five feet, about two-thirds of the meaſure of the church of St. Peter's at Rome <note n="130" place="bottom">The length of St. Peter's is 840 Roman palms; each palm is very little ſhort of nine Engliſh inches.

IV. The new ſovereigns of Perſia, Artaxerxes and his ſon Sapor, had triumphed (as we have already ſeen) over the houſe of Arſaces. Of the <note place="margin">Conqueſt of Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia by the Perſians.</note> many princes of that ancient race, Choſroes, king of Armenia, had alone preſerved both his life and his independence.

The patriotic ſatraps of Armenia, who aſſerted the freedom and dignity of the crown, implored the protection of Rome in favour of Tiridates the lawful heir. But the ſon of Choſroes was an infant, the allies were at a diſtance, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian monarch advanced towards the frontier at the head of an irreſiſtible force. Young Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, the future hope of his country, was ſaved by the fidelity of a ſervant, and Armenia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued above twenty-ſeven years a reluctant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the great monarchy of Perſia <note n="134" place="bottom">Moſes Chorenenſis, l. ii. c. 71. 73, 74.

The imperial ſlave was eager to ſecure the favour of his maſter, by an act of treaſon to his native country. He conducted Sapor over the <note place="margin">Sapor overruns Syria, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia, and Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</note> Euphrates, and by the way of Chalcis to the metropolis of the Eaſt. So rapid were the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Perſian cavalry, that, if we may credit a very judicious hiſtorian <note n="141" place="bottom">The ſack of Antioch, anticipated by ſome hiſtorians, is aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the deciſive teſtimony of Ammianus Marcellinus, to the reign of Gallienus, xxiii. 5.</note>, the city of Antioch was ſurpriſed when the idle multitude was fondly gazing on the amuſements of the theatre. The ſplendid buildings of Antioch, private as well as public, were either pillaged or deſtroyed; and the numerous inhabitants were put to the ſword, or led away into captivity <note n="142" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. i. p. 35.</note>. The tide of devaſtation was ſtopped for a moment by the reſolution of the high prieſt of Emeſa. Arrayed in his ſacerdotal robes, he appeared at the head of a great body of fanatic peaſants, armed only with ſlings, and defended his god and his property from the ſacrilegious hands of the followers of Zoroaſter <note n="143" place="bottom">John Malala, tom. i. p. 391.

But the ruin of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and of many other cities, furniſhes a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly proof that, except in this ſingular inſtance, the conqueſt of Syria and Cilicia ſcarcely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the progreſs of the Perſian arms. The advantages of the narrow paſſes of mount Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus were abandoned, in which an invader, whoſe principal force conſiſted in his cavalry, would have been engaged in a very unequal combat:
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0034700101:463"/>
and Sapor was permitted to form the ſie geof Caeſarea, the capital of Cappadocia; a city, though of the ſecond rank, which was ſuppoſed to contain four hundred thouſand inhabitants. Demoſthenes commanded in the place, not ſo much by the commiſſion of the emperor, as in the voluntary defence of his country. For a long time he deferred its fate; and, when at laſt Caeſarea was betrayed by the perfidy of a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, he cut his way through the Perſians, who had been ordered to exert their utmoſt diligence to take him alive. This heroic chief eſcaped the power of a foe, who might either have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured or puniſhed his obſtinate valour; but many thouſands of his fellow-citizens were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a general maſſacre, and Sapor is accuſed of treating his priſoners with wanton and unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cruelty <note n="144" place="bottom">Zonaras, l. xii. p. 630.

Much ſhould undoubtedly be allowed for national animoſity, much for hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled pride and impotent revenge; yet, upon the whole, it is certain, that the ſame prince, who, in Armenia, had diſplayed the mild aſpect of a legiſlator, ſhewed himſelf to the Romans under the ſtern features of a conqueror. He deſpaired of making any permanent eſtabliſhment in the empire, and ſought only to leave behind him a waſted deſert, whilſt he tranſported into Perſia the people and the treaſures of the provinces <note n="145" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. i. p. 25. aſſerts, that Sapor, had he not preferred ſpoil to conqueſt, might have remained maſter of Aſia.</note>.</p>

At the time when the Eaſt trembled at the name of Sapor, he received a preſent not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the greateſt kings; a long train of camels <note place="margin">Boldneſs and ſucceſs of Odena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por.</note> laden with the moſt rare and valuable merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes. The rich offering was accompanied with an epiſtle, reſpectful but not ſervile, from Ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathus, one of the nobleſt and moſt opulent ſenators of Palmyra. <q>Who is this Odenathus (ſaid the haughty Victor, and he commanded that the preſents ſhould be caſt into the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates), that he thus inſolently preſumes to write to his lord?

            <p>The voice of hiſtory, which is often little <note place="margin">Treatment of Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> more than the organ of hatred or flattery, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches Sapor with a proud abuſe of the rights of conqueſt. We are told that Valerian, in chains, but inveſted with the Imperial purple, was expoſed to the multitude, a conſtant ſpectacle of fallen greatneſs; and that whenever the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian monarch mounted on horſeback, he placed his foot on the neck of a Roman emperor. Notwithſtanding all the remonſtrances of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who repeatedly adviſed him to remember the viciſſitude of fortune, to dread the returning power of Rome, and to make his illuſtrious cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the pledge of peace, not the object of inſult, Sapor ſtill remained inflexible. When Valerian ſunk under the weight of ſhame and grief, his ſkin, ſtuffed with ſtraw, and formed into the likeneſs of a human figure, was preſerved for ages in the moſt celebrated temple of Perſia; a more real monument of triumph, than the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied trophies of braſs and marble ſo often erected by Roman vanity <note n="150" place="bottom">The Pagan writers lament, the Chriſtian inſult, the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of Valerian.

See Bibliotheque Orientale.</note>. The tale is moral and
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:0034700101:466"/>
pathetic, but the truth of it may very fairly be called in queſtion. The letters ſtill extant from the princes of the Eaſt to Sapor, are manifeſt forgeries <note n="151" place="bottom">One of theſe epiſtles is from Artavaſdes, king of Armenia: ſince Armenia was then a province in Perſia, the king, the kingdom, and the epiſtle, muſt be fictitious.</note>; nor is it natural to ſuppoſe that a jealous monarch ſhould, even in the perſon of a rival, thus publicly degrade the majeſty of kings. Whatever treatment the unfortunate Valerian might experience in Perſia, it is at leaſt certain, that the only emperor of Rome who had ever fallen into the hands of the enemy, languiſhed away his life in hopeleſs captivity.</p>

It is difficult to paint the light, the various, the inconſtant character of Gallienus, which he diſplayed without conſtraint, as ſoon as he became ſole poſſeſſor of the empire. In every art that he attempted, his lively genius
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:0034700101:467"/>
enabled him to ſucceed; and as his genius was deſtitute of judgment, he attempted every art, except the important ones of war and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was a maſter of ſeveral curious but uſeleſs ſciences, a ready orator, and elegant poet <note n="153" place="bottom">There is ſtill extant a very pretty Epithalamium, compoſed by Gallienus for the nuptials of his nephews.

repeated intelligence of invaſions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careleſs ſmile; and ſingling out, with affected contempt, ſome particular production of the loſt province, he careleſsly aſked, whether Rome muſt be ruined, unleſs it was ſupplied with linen from Egypt, and Arras cloth from Gaul? There were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a few ſhort moments in the life of Gallienus, when, exaſperated by ſome recent injury, he ſuddenly appeared the intrepid ſoldier, and the cruel tyrant; till ſatiated with blood, or fatigued by reſiſtance, he inſenſibly ſunk into the natural mildneſs and indolence of his character <note n="156" place="bottom">This ſingular character has, I believe, been fairly tranſmitted to us. The reign of his immediate ſucceſſor was ſhort and buſy; and the hiſtorians who wrote before the elevation of the family of Conſtantine, could not have the moſt remote intereſt to miſrepreſent the character of Gallienus.</note>.</p>

It was probably ſome ingenious fancy, of comparing the thirty tyrants of Rome with the thirty tyrants of Athens, that induced the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Auguſtan hiſtory to ſelect that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated number, which has been gradually receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a popular appellation <note n="157" place="bottom">Pollio expreſſes the moſt minute anxiety to complete the number.</note>.

of thirty perſons, the united oppreſſors of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle city, and an uncertain liſt of independent rivals, who roſe and fell in irregular ſucceſſion through the extent of a vaſt empire? Nor can the number of thirty be completed, unleſs we include in the account the women and children who were honoured with the Imperial title. The reign of Gallienus, diſtracted as it was, produced only nineteen pretenders to the throne; Cyriades <note place="margin">Their real number was no more than nineteen.</note>, Macrianus, Baliſta, Odenathus, and Zenobia in the eaſt; in Gaul, and the weſtern provinces, Poſthumus, Lollianus, Victorinus and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Victoria, Marius, and Tetricus.

power, without any reference to the abuſe of it. Several of the pretenders, who raiſed the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of rebellion againſt the emperor Gallienus, were ſhining models of virtue, and almoſt all poſſeſſed a conſiderable ſhare of vigour and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Their merit had recommended them to the favour of Valerian, and gradually promoted them to the moſt important commands of the empire. The generals, who aſſumed the title of Auguſtus, were either reſpected by their troops for their able conduct and ſevere diſcipline, or admired for valour and ſucceſs in war, or beloved for frankneſs and generoſity. The field of victory was often the ſcene of their election; and even the armourer Marius, the moſt contemptible of all the candidates for the purple, was diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed however by intrepid courage, matchleſs ſtrength, and blunt honeſty <note n="160" place="bottom">See the ſpeech of Marius, in the Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 197.

uſurpers, it will appear, that they were much oftener driven into rebellion by their fears, than urged to it by their ambition. They dreaded the cruel ſuſpicions of Gallienus; they equally dreaded the capricious violence of their troops. If the dangerous favour of the army had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently declared them deſerving of the purple, they were marked for ſure deſtruction; and even prudence would counſel them, to ſecure a ſhort enjoyment of empire, and rather to try the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of war, than to expect the hand of an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner. When the clamour of the ſoldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted the reluctant victims with the enſigns of ſovereign authority, they ſometimes mourned in ſecret their approaching fate. <q>You have loſt, ſaid Saturninus, on the day of his elevation, you have loſt a uſeful commander, and you have made a very wretched emperor <note n="164" place="bottom">Hiſt.

            <p>The apprehenſions of Saturninus were juſtified <note place="margin">Their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deaths.</note> by the repeated experience of revolutions. Of the nineteen tyrants who ſtarted up under the reign of Gallienus, there was not one who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a life of peace, or a natural death. As ſoon as they were inveſted with the bloody pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they inſpired their adherents with the ſame fears and ambition which had occaſioned their own revolt. Encompaſſed with domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, military ſedition, and civil war, they trembled on the edge of precipices, in which, after a longer or ſhorter term of anxiety, they were inevitably loſt. Theſe precarious monarchs

received, however, ſuch honours, as the flattery of their reſpective armies and provinces could beſtow; but their claim, founded on rebellion, could never obtain the ſanction of law or hiſtory. Italy, Rome, and the ſenate, conſtantly adhered to the cauſe of Gallienus, and he alone was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the ſovereign of the empire. That prince condeſcended indeed to acknowledge the victorious arms of Odenathus, who deſerved the honourable diſtinction, by the reſpectful conduct which he always maintained towards the ſon of Valerian. With the general applauſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and the conſent of Gallienus, the ſenate conferred the title of Auguſtus on the brave Palmyrenian; and ſeemed to intruſt him with the government of the Eaſt, which he already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, in ſo independent a manner, that, like a private ſucceſſion, he bequeathed it to his illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious widow Zenobia <note n="165" place="bottom">The aſſociation of the brave Palmyrenian was the moſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act of the whole reign of Gallienus.

people. However virtuous was their character however pure their intentions, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reduced to the hard neceſſity of ſupporting their uſurpation by frequent acts of rapine and cruelty.

The ſituation of Sicily preſerved it from the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians; nor could the diſarmed province have ſupported an uſurper. The ſufferings of that

once flouriſhing and ſtill fertile iſland, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by baſer hands. A licentious crowd of ſlaves and peaſants reigned for a while over the plundered country, and renewed the memory of the ſervile wars of more ancient times <note n="169" place="bottom">The Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 177, calls it <hi>ſervile bellum.</hi> See Diodor. Sicul. l. xxxiv.</note>. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations, of which the huſbandman was either the victim or the accomplice, muſt have ruined the agriculture of Sicily; and as the principal eſtates were the property of the opulent ſenators of Rome, who often encloſed within a farm the territory of an old republic, it is not improbable, that this private injury might affect the capital more deeply, than all the conqueſts of the Goths or the Perſians.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The foundation of Alexandria was a noble <note place="margin">Tumults of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</note> deſign, at once conceived and executed by the ſon of Philip. The beautiful and regular form of that great city, ſecond only to Rome itſelf, comprehended a circumference of fifteen miles <note n="170" place="bottom">Plin. Hiſt. Natur. v. 10.</note>; it was peopled by three hundred thouſand free inhabitants, beſides at leaſt an equal number of ſlaves <note n="171" place="bottom">Diodor. Sicul. l. xvii. p. 590. Edit. Weſſeling.</note>. The lucrative trade of Arabia and India flowed through the port of Alexandria to the capital and provinces of the empire. Idleneſs was unknown. Some were employed in blowing of glaſs, others in weaving of linen, others again manufacturing the papyrus. Either ſex, and every age, was engaged in the purſuits of induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nor did even the blind or the lame want

occupations ſuited to their condition <note n="172" place="bottom">See a very curious letter of Hadrian, in the Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 245.</note>. But the people of Alexandria, a various mixture of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, united the vanity and inconſtancy of the Greeks, with the ſuperſtition and obſtinacy of the Egyptians. The moſt trifling occaſion, a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient ſcarcity of fleſh or lentils, the neglect of an accuſtomed ſalutation, a miſtake of precedency in the public baths, or even a religious diſpute <note n="173" place="bottom">Such as the ſacrilegious murder of a divine cat. See Diodor. Sicul. l. i.</note>, were at any time ſufficient to kindle a ſedition among that vaſt multitude, whoſe reſentments were furious and implacable <note n="174" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 195. This long and terrible ſedition was firſt occaſioned by a diſpute between a ſoldier and a townſman about a pair of ſhoes.</note>. After the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of Valerian and the inſolence of his ſon had relaxed the authority of the laws, the Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians abandoned themſelves to the ungoverned rage of their paſſions, and their unhappy country was the theatre of a civil war, which continued (with a few ſhort and ſuſpicious truces) above twelve years <note n="175" place="bottom">Dionyſius apud Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccleſ. vol. vii. p. 21. Ammian. xxii. 16.</note>. All intercourſe was cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſeveral quarters of the afflicted city, every ſtreet was polluted with blood, every build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſtrength converted into a citadel; nor did the tumults ſubſide, till a conſiderable part of Alexandria was irretrievably ruined. The ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and magnificent diſtrict of Bruchion, with its palaces and muſaeum, the reſidence of the

kings and philoſophers of Egypt, is deſcribed above a century afterwards, as already reduced to its preſent ſtate of dreary ſolitude <note n="176" place="bottom">Scaliger. Animadver. ad Euſeb. Chron. p. 258. Three diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertations of M. Bonamy, in the Mem. de l'Academie, tom. ix.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The obſcure rebellion of Trebellianus, <note place="margin">Rebellion of the Iſaurians.</note> who aſſumed the purple in Iſauria, a petty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Aſia Minor, was attended with ſtrange and memorable conſequences. The pageant of royalty was ſoon deſtroyed by an officer of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus; but his followers; deſpairing of mercy, reſolved to ſhake off their allegiance, not only to the emperor, but to the empire, and ſuddenly returned to the ſavage manners, from which they had never perfectly been reclaimed. Their crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy rocks, a branch of the wide-extended Taurus, protected their inacceſſible retreat. The tillage of ſome fertile vallies <note n="177" place="bottom">Strabo, l. xii. p. 569.</note> ſupplied them with neceſſaries, and a habit of rapine with the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of life. In the heart of the Roman mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the Iſaurians long continued a nation of wild barbarians. Succeeding princes, unable to reduce them to obedience either by arms or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, were compelled to acknowledge their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by ſurrounding the hoſtile and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſpot, with a ſtrong chain of fortifications <note n="178" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 197.</note>, which often proved inſufficient to reſtrain the incurſions of theſe domeſtic foes. The Iſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, gradually extending their territory to the ſea-coaſt, ſubdued the weſtern and mountainous part of Cilicia, formerly the neſt of thoſe daring

pirates, againſt whom the republic had once been obliged to exert its utmoſt force, under the conduct of the great Pompey <note n="179" place="bottom">See Cellarius, Georg. Antiq. tom. ii. p. 137. upon the limits of Iſauria.</note>.</p>
            <p>Our habits of thinking ſo fondly connect the <note place="margin">Famine and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note> order of the univerſe with the fate of man, that this gloomy period of hiſtory has been decorated with inundations, earthquakes, uncommon me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, preternatural darkneſs, and a crowd of prodigies fictitious or exaggerated <note n="180" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 177.</note>. But a long and general famine was a calamity of a more ſerious kind. It was the inevitable conſequence of rapine and oppreſſion, which extirpated the produce of the preſent, and the hope of future harveſts. Famine is almoſt always followed by epidemical diſeaſes, the effect of ſcanty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome food. Other cauſes muſt however have contributed to the furious plague, which, from the year two hundred and fifty, to the year two hundred and ſixty-five, raged without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in every province, every city, and almoſt every family, of the Roman empire. During ſome time five thouſand perſons died daily in Rome; and many towns, that had eſcaped the hands of the barbarians, were entirely depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <note n="181" place="bottom">Hiſt. Anguſt. p. 177. Zoſimus, l. i. p. 24. Zonaras, l. xii. p. 623. Euſeb. Chronicon. Victor in Epitom. Victor in Caeſar. Eutropius, ix. 5. Oroſius, vii. 21.</note>.</p>
            <p>We have the knowledge of a very curious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, <note place="margin">Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the human ſpecies.</note> of ſome uſe perhaps in the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly

calculation of human calamities. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act regiſter was kept at Alexandria, of all the citizens entitled to receive the diſtribution of corn. It was found, that the ancient number of thoſe compriſed between the ages of forty and ſeventy, had been equal to the whole ſum of claimants, from fourteen to fourſcore years of age, who remained alive after the reign of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus <note n="182" place="bottom">Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccleſ. vii. 21. The fact is taken from the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Dionyſius, who, in the time of thoſe troubles, was biſhop of Alexandria.</note>. Applying this authentic fact to the moſt correct tables of mortality, it evidently proves, that above half the people of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria had periſhed; and could we venture to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the analogy to the other provinces, we might ſuſpect, that war, peſtilence, and famine, had conſumed, in a few years, the moiety of the human ſpecies <note n="183" place="bottom">In a great number of pariſhes 11,000 perſons were found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fourteen and eighty; 5365 between forty and ſeventy.
