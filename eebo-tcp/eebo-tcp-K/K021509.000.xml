            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>LONG has been ſerv'd from this our motley Stage,</l>
            <l>Repaſts for various taſtes—from youth to age—</l>
            <l>To lively Miſs, eſcap'd from Sſhool and toil,</l>
            <l>Our ſports have oft beſtow'd the infant ſmile,</l>
            <l>While the rude boy, from Weſtminſter or Eton,</l>
            <l>Who <hi>"ſpies,"</hi> and <hi>"quizzes"</hi> one, where'er they meet one.</l>
            <l>For them, our brilliant Ballets drawn from Greece,</l>
            <l>Reſtore their Greek—without a rod a piece.</l>
            <l>While tricks and tumbling honeſt John employ,</l>
            <l>Who drinks his punch aloft, and ſcreams with joy.</l>
            <l>The wife is all for muſic, ſhakes and thrilling,</l>
            <l>Old maids, from ſoft humanity, love killing:</l>
            <l>Each has his taſte: for married life may ſay,</l>
            <l>Not oft' two perſons think in the ſame way.</l>

he don't know me in my regimentals—he may be uſeful <stage>aſide</stage> well! how are you? Its very cold indeed—ſo let's get warm by ſhaking hands— you're a fine fellow!</p>

                  <p>Yes, and an honeſt fellow too;—for when ſo be, I ſees miſchief going forward, that I've no hand in, I always tries to prevent it.</p>

                  <p>Yes, you have no hand in it, and therefore tries to prevent it.</p>

                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes;—now do you ſee that veſſel down in the harbour—it belongs to that old piece of totteration, Fractioſo—he that is the Vice-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>
                  <p>Rota, Scrota, and ſo forth. I know him—well, what is he going to do with that veſſel?</p>

                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>I'll tell you—he has gotten a houſe in the remote part of the country, among the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on the ſea-coaſt—and he is going to take his daughter there, and all his plate, and his jewels, and every thing he can carry away.</p>

                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, they ſays he don't like the Count Montoni, her huſband, as well as he was uſed, and they have had words together, and I ſuppoſe he thinks, if he doesn't ſecure the property himſelf, the Count will do it for him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>
                  <p>Likely enough—but hasn't he another daughter?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; but ſhe has no huſband to make any claims, and to take care that ſhe never ſhall, he has ſent her to a convent.</p>

            <l>LOVE'S influence drawn from ſcenes of former years,</l>
            <l>Why not pourtray it as it now appears.</l>
            <l>Annette no more—the Italian confidante,</l>
            <l>Suppoſe me now an old French gouvernante,</l>
            <l>With coaxing cringe my pupil's heart to charm,</l>
            <l>Diſcourſing fond and freely—arm in arm.</l>
            <l>She in the bloom of life, and height of taſte,</l>
            <l>A yard of feather, and an inch of waiſt;</l>
            <l>Waiſt did I ſay? I meant to mend my phraſe,</l>
            <l>The ſpot which was the ſummit of the ſtays;</l>
            <l>"Young Charles," ſhe ſighs—no—the old Peer, his brother,</l>
            <l>"I love the one—then, marry with the other—</l>
            <l>"His withered hands, ſo terrible to touch,</l>
            <l>"But then the Coronet upon his crutch—</l>
            <l>"Delightful thought! That puts an end to ſorrow,</l>
            <l>"I'll have him, if papa conſent, to-morrowi</l>
            <l>What glomwing love muſt ſpring from ſuch a channel!</l>
            <l>They can't be cold, who're always wrap'd in flannel.</l>
            <l>Turn we to courtſhip in a different ſtrain:</l>
            <l>An ancient Venus, and a youthful ſwain.</l>
            <l>The Fair, if won, a mine of wealth would prove,</l>
            <l>The hero, poor in every thing but love,</l>
            <l>A crumplin ſhe, head ſhrunk between her ſhoulders,</l>

            <l>Her tiny perſon, and her cumb'rous pack</l>
            <l>Look like a drum girt round a drummer's back—</l>
            <l>The ſix foot ſtripling, firm in every joint,</l>

            <l>With mouth ſcarce viſible, you'd think our beau,</l>
            <l>The man in armour at my Lord Mayor's ſhow</l>
            <l>"Marry me, ma'am, he cries, and take your ſwing,</l>
            <l>"Dam'me, I love you dearly—that's the thing:</l>
            <l>"Who can ſuch charming accents diſapprove?</l>

            <l>The little Lady all on tiptoe ſtands—</l>
            <l>He ſtoops—ſhe ſprings—and ſo they join their hands.</l>
