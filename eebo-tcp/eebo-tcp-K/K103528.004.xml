            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I HAVE been told I could prevent riotous proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.—But I muſt beg leave to obſerve, that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrical opinions are ſo variable, unſettled, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, that I fear my reaſons will have as little effect as if I were to entreat that all metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts would follow the playhouſe, or that metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts could perſuade all play attendants to become devotees at the tabernacle.</p>
            <p>The good government that prevails in general at Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres is owing to uniformity; decorum begets decorum. Conſequently the ſtrict order to be found in the London audiences does not owe its happy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation entirely to three or four conſtables in waiting, or to ten or twelve of the King's guards.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0593400204:4"/>
Witneſs the great riot on the Chineſe Feſtival at Drury Lane, in ſpite of the ſanction of his Majeſty King George the Second, who was there in perſon.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance.—When the French actors were to have performed at the Haymarket theatre, Juſtice Du <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eil, attended by conſtables, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced with the King's guards, were defeated by numbers and determined phrenzy; then, truly, might overcame right.</p>
            <p>Nay, yearly at Chriſtmas holidays in London, on retroſpection, the plays are indiſtinctly and with difficulty got through.</p>
            <p>On an uproar, when Lady Coventry and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other perſons of quality were obliged to quit the ſtage-box, on account of a ſuppoſed affront given to Miſs Bellamy in Juliet, it was the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and not any other force compelled thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers to leave the theatre.</p>
            <p>In 1754, when Captain Smith of the guards gave offence on the firſt night Mr Murphy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Jaffier, and only his ſecond character on the ſtage, it was the general voice that would not permit the play to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d till the cauſe of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption was re <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oved.</p>
            <p>At York formerly, on a Shrove Tueſday, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a ſavage cuſtom, the upper gallery was ſo noiſy from num ers, that it could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered but by raiſing the price on that night, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0593400204:5"/>
which has by the experiment in a great meaſure removed the evil.</p>
            <p>I beg leave to be here underſtood as ſpeaking of theatres in general; but when the propriety of London is ſingled out, let it be well recollected that <hi>the audiences there preſerve their own reſpect;</hi> for the inſtant the curtain draws up all noiſe ſubſides, and every perſon ſits down; nor will they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uffer the actors to proceed if a hat remains on a head: but in moſt country theatres, when the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance begins, the vgazers in the galleries ſtand up, and with their hats on; nay hats are too often ſeen on in the pit.</p>
            <p>If at London a rioter is vociferous in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, they are from cuſtom and good regulation ſo habituated to order and neceſſary attention, that the offender is by <hi>univerſal</hi> conſent delivered over to the conſtables, who not only conducts the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prit out of the gallery, but if guilty of throwing bottles, &amp;c. on the ſtage, or into the pit or boxes, he is conveyed before a juſtice to be properly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A diſturbance there, even of a ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeldom happens in the pit; for the inſtant of interruption the perſon is removed by force, and turned out with diſgrace and ignominy.</p>
            <p>To repeat more as to myſelf concerning the winter at Edinburgh in 1765 would not only be fulſome and impertinent, but is far from being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0593400204:6"/>
neceſſary, nor would it be entertaining. I acted a variety of characters, and ſuffice it to ſay I was well received, and met with great civilities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences: Richard, Bayes, and Foote's pieces were repeated. My firſt benefit, on Friday, March 22, was a fine houſe: Alexander was revived, with a triumph, &amp;c. at the managers' expence, and a farce written by Mr. Chaigneau, of Dublin, called Harlequin Soldier, taken from the French. My ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond benefit was the laſt night in the ſeaſon, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, April 13, another play, never acted there, called Coriolanus, with a new burleſque farce in two acts, wrote by Dr. Schombergh of Bath, called Bucephalus: The play pleaſed much—the farce not at all—though after playing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus I produced myſelf as Princeſs Statira. In a few days I engaged to proceed with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers and company to Glaſgow, where my bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain was chiefly dependent on two clear benefits, and full of hopes that a ſecond fire would not be wickedly put into practice, or even attempted, as had been the year before. Moſt of the ſame plays acted at Edinburgh were ready, and repeated at Glaſgow. My firſt benefit was upwards of 62 l. The play was Henry the Fourth; Falſtaff, Mr. Lancaſter; Prince of Wales, Mr. Aickin; Hotſpur, Mr. Wilkinſon: The farce I have forgot.—Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter was a great favourite at Edinburgh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0593400204:7"/>
My ſecond benefit was only 30l.—The Play was Eſſex: Eſſex, Mr. Wilkinſon; with Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy A-la-Mode, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſenſible, the friendly, the ſpirited, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vivacious Mr. Sinclair (of whom York boaſts as an honourable acquiſition to its inhabitants) was that year at Glaſgow college: I have had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of hearing him declare the firſt play he ever ſaw acted was the night I appeared in the difficult character of King Lear at the Glaſgow theatre; and whether the performance was ſuper-excellent or the contrary is not for me to determine: But I dare affirm (being the firſt impreſſion made on his youthful mind) that he was highly delighted, and will never forget Wilkinſon's Lear, let any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's merit, how great ſoever, interfere on his ſight and more enlightened judgment.</p>
            <p>I do not recollect any circumſtance worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in that trip to Glaſgow, except my having the pleaſure of being on a degree of intimacy with the worthy Mr. John Moore, known better by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called the good <hi>Johnny Moore;</hi> he was a gentleman (very extraordinary to ſay) that every body loved and reſpected. At his houſe I was often moſt agreeably entertained, and particularly whenever Mr. Nicholſon Stewart and others paid him a viſit, and came on a trip to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the play from Edinburgh. That ſaid good character Mr.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0593400204:8"/>
Moore, is mentioned, not only by Mrs. Bellamy, but alſo by Doctor Smollet in his novel of Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey Clinker; all praiſed and loved him: and ſurely what every one ſaid muſt be true. I returned from Glaſgow to Newcaſtle, where my old friend Mr. Baker, manager of the York company, was ſtationed at the races at that town. It was their uſual yearly ſervice at that time for the ſummer ſeaſon, till York meeting the latter end of Auguſt.</p>
            <p>I acted Cadwalladar on the Saturday in the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle race-week, and Major Sturgeon the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following,—I had indeed been ſecretly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by Mr. Baker for Newcaſtle (where I had never played till that time) before my departure from Glaſgow. I continued at Newcaſtle (to the finiſhing of the ſeaſon in Auguſt) at Mr. Parker's, the Turk's-Head in the Big Market, which houſe Mr. Baker for many years made his conſtant place of reſidence. All went ſmoothly on—we had a good race-week, a good aſſize-week, and ſeveral very good benefits.—Sir Francis Delaval cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> down that ſummer from the ſouth to his ſeat of Seaton Delaval, built as I have been told under Sir John Vanbrugh's direction:—Mr. David Roſs came there at the ſame time by the invitation of Sir Francis:—Sir John (now Lord) Delaval and his Lady were there; alſo Thomas Delaval, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the younger brother; (and ſorry am I to add, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0593400204:9"/>
is well known, that when Sir Francis died I loſt a valuable and honourable friend; the younger brother is alſo dead). So that with engagements at Sir Francis Delaval's, many invitations at Newcaſtle, where they are particularly hoſpitable, my time paſſed agreeably and profitably. I ſet myſelf a hard taſk preparatory to my own benefit, which was to finiſh the ſeaſon, by getting up Mr. Macklin's favourite farce of Love A-la-Mode: With patience and aſſiduity it was a poſſible work, and promiſed much credit and caſh:—To tell the truth I had by luck obtained the parts by the following method:—The part of Sir Archy I had to prepare myſelf in; Mr. Garrick ſent it to me at Wincheſter in the year 1760; Squire Groom from my friend Ned Shuter; Mordecai from Mr. Creſwick, who had acted the part at Covent Garden; the lady's part from Mrs. Burden's copy, who played it at the ſame theatre: So I had only to make the Iriſh character of Sir Callaghan, which by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of ſeeing the farce, and the help of the firſt act being printed in a magazine, made it with a little trouble more than half ready to my hands; Sir Theodore, a part from remembrance; the reſt of my own manufacture.</p>
            <p>Mr. Macklin, it is true, was juſtifiably angry; but mine, for his credit, was better acted, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0593400204:10"/>
more like his farce than the ſtuff given in every country town with pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oined lines only: And Mr. Shylock to me proved himſelf no Jew, but a friend and a good Chriſtian; he forgot and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave, and occaſionally favoured me with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to act the farce of Love A-la-Mode; though he after, jokingly, called me a great rogue. I could not but allow the juſtice of his accuſation; I have often invited him to viſit York; but he was always better pleaſed by my viſiting him, and accepting his cheer, good-will, and kindneſs, than trying the experiment of my Yorkſhire board.</p>
            <p>I concluded at Newcaſtle with Love A-la-Mode. As the farce was got up with the care and the auſterity almoſt of Mr. Macklin himſelf, had he been the inſpector, it was received with an univerſal effect, almoſt equal to a London repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation when that piece was in its higheſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.—At Newcaſtle it was caſt as follows: Sir Archy, Mr. Wilkinſon; Sir Callaghan, Mr. Frodſham; Squire Groom, Mr. Creſwick, &amp;c. A crowded houſe, and from the flattering recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was honoured with at that town, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from the compliments I received there at that time, my vanity ſuggeſted I ſhould be a laſting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite; though I aftewards experienced a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0593400204:11"/>
temper, like the ſaying of friends, who are ſoon hot and as ſoon cold.</p>
            <p>The York races (which in the year 1765 were in their great glory) made me imagine Love A-la-Mode would prove of the higheſt conſequence there:—Good old Mr. Baker ſaid, he could not be happy unleſs his adopted ſon Tate Wilkinſon would oblige him by being at York that race<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>week; and he really treated me as a ſon, with one fault attending a partial father, which was, <q rend="inline">"All I did was right."</q> Mr. Baker's liberality I had not the leaſt occaſion to doubt; and if without any emolument whatever my ſervices could have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or ſerved ſo worthy and kind a friend, they were ſincerely at his command.—We came as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſon to his houſe at-York, where in fact I was the <hi>major <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>aid to I by itſelf I, <hi>I</hi> ſhould do great things at the theatre from Love A-la-Mode, which would go down more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly than my tea which they had not approved; and expected to be applauded as a Garrick, a Foote, and a Macklin, in the different characters: And here, good reader, you will obſerve a leſſon for vanity, and as efficacious and as good a cure as are Spilſbury's drops for the ſcurvy, or Godbold's for a conſumption.—I was ſo aſſured of ſucceſs with Love A-la-Mode, &amp;c. though when in May 1764 I had not thought of ever viſiting York
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0593400204:12"/>
again, notwithſtanding I had left that city in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable favour that trip;—and mark, good reader, that to Love A-la-Mode—thereby hangs a tale and eventful hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The Monday in the race week I fixed on Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader in the farce, as a part I was certain the York audience were partial to me in, and judged I was eſtabliſhed in their opinions. (That year, 1765, was the ſecond of the new theatre.) When at rehearſal that noon a meſſage was ſent to me, while on the ſtage, that ſeveral gentlemen deſired to ſpeak with me in Mr. Baker's dining-room; I inſtantly obeyed the ſummons, (firſt deſiring the performers to wait) and in imagination aſſuring myſelf it muſt certainly be a complimentary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beſpoke play, for my performing in ſome ſhining character the night following. When I made my entrance into the room, in high mirth and glee, where the gentlemen were, and was ſinging aloud— <q>

of the Author, a farce of Mr. Foote's, which was intended for that very evening; when a young gentleman quickly replied, <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is that very rehearſal and farce I came to put an immediate ſtop to;"</q> then turning to Mr. Baker, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, you need not be informed the York theatre is not licenſed; and if you are not acquainted with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtance, I beg you will underſtand you are guilty of a double offence, by a flagrant breach of law and flying in the face of authority, as the impudent libel called the Author, written by that ſcoundrel Foote, was ſtopped from any future performance ſix years ago, in December 1758, and has not been permitted ſince.—My name, Mr. Wilkinſon, is Aprice, and the character of Cadwallader, you mean to perform, is an affront to the memory of my father (who is now dead): As his ſon, by G—d, I will not ſuffer ſuch inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For ſome minutes Mr. Baker and I ſtood and gazed at each other like Gayleſs and Sharp after Kitty Pry's departure—where one ſays, <q rend="inline">"O Sharp!

council it was agreed to be naturally ſtupid, ſay nothing, but ſubſtitute the Mayor of Garratt, and proceed with the farce, ſo changed, without any apology whatever.—It certainly was the ſtrangeſt mode that ever was adopted, or that ever was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without momentous conſequences, attended with ſtrict inquiring and inveſtigation.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſcene between Sir Jacob Jollup and Mr. Lint the apothecary, the <hi>aſtoniſhed</hi> audience ſat, each ſtaring in his fellow's face, like Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare's blackſmith with his hammer up and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a tailor's news, and concluded it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new by Wilkinſon foiſted into the Author; but when I was announced as the Major, and made my entrance, the reader will not be ſurpriſed when informed I was received with an univerſal hiſs.—I took no notice, but went on—The diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation continued, but not ſo virulently as to occaſion a ſtand ſtill; and the reader may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured we loſt no time in getting our work over, but wiſhed for bed-time, and that all were well: for though I owed Heaven a debt, it is clearly evident it was not then due; and I was, like Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, loath to pay before the day. At laſt the death of that day's life came on, the curtain drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peo, and the poor Major Sturgeon ſneaked away with marks of anger following at his heels, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

So ended the firſt leſſon of the week, where I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have outdone my uſual outdoings; but the greateſt generals have met with diſgraces and misfortunes.</p>
            <p>Tueſday I acted the Lyar, which went off wonderfully well; I breathed better than in the morning, and felt once more a little elated. I had fixed on the Apprentice as the entertainment, which the ſummer before had done much for me in London; but unfortunately it happened to be a favourite part of Mr. Frodſham's, (who in truth did not play it well, but quite the contrary) and in that character I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ailed again, without a ſingle hand to aſſiſt; I laboured through a part which in London I had been much flattered by applauſe in the extreme; my imitations were not known in Yorkſhire, therefore naturally paſſed without the leaſt effect:—The reader will ſmile at the pleaſant week I had promiſed myſelf, but I fed on thin diet, that of hope, which I doubted not would give a brilliant and good ending after the bad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0593400204:17"/>
Tonſor, I judged my ſucceſs could not be doubted; and indeed I was ſo like in voice, dreſs, and manner, it was a moot point which was which; but the cracking of nuts were the only tokens of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; and my <hi>nerves</hi> are irritated at the ſound from that hour to the preſent. I was particularly attached to Sir John Brute, and think it was not improper for me as a comedian, as I had paid the ſtricte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t attention to Mr. Garrick in that part, and it might have been termed a lucky performance of mine. I had not ſtudied it from my own ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, but firſt at the particular deſire of Mr. <hi>Johnny Moore</hi> of Glaſgow.</p>
            <p>About twelve on the Wedneſday, when I had finiſhed the rehearſal of the Provoked Wife, a deputation of gentlemen were ſent as ambaſſadors from the ladies aſſembled then at Giordani's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert.—York races were then in their high glory. Giordani was at that time under the patronage of Lady Bingley, who had great ſway in that town and county, and was really enthuſiaſtically muſical: ſhe ſettled 200l. a year on him; which annuity he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys to this day, and will to the end of his life.</p>
            <p>The gentlemen who came from the rooms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me and Mr. Baker, that Lady Bingley, and all the ladies aſſembled, ſent their compliments; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to ſhew every encouragement to the manager, but it was with the proviſo that ſo indecent a play as the Provoked Wife (which the ladies could not by any means countenance, and deſired if their protection and patronage was worth conſideration) might be changed to another comedy; but if their requeſt was not complied with, they ſhould not on any account enter the theatre, as they would not by any means think of ſetting out ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper a repreſentation.—(Here was another bar againſt my riſe to greatneſs at York, and from that fatal day my favourite part and play was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exploded, and truly to my loſs by its being expunged; for ladies to the boxes I never by any means could get to that well-wrote, entertaining piece, though I confeſs it has its blemiſhes.)—The ladies added, that as to the farce of the Uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterer being altered it was very immaterial, as very few would continue after the play, but go to the rooms.—More comfort ſtill for unfortunate Wilkinſon!</p>
            <p>Well! the command, as it might be termed, from the boxes, was likely and neceſſary to be obeyed, however mortifying it was to me; freſh bills were iſſuedforth with every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary information of the play being altered, at the univerſal deſire of perſons of diſtinction to Love in a Village, in which a lady of inimitable

talents and great muſical abilities performed the part of Roſetta: She is now in a ſuperior rank of life, by being united to a perſon diſtinguiſhable for his indefatigable talents, whoſe underſtanding has greatly added to the advantage of the commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intereſt of the three kingdoms, and who is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally reſpected.—It is almoſt needleſs to add, the gentleman's name is Palmer, Comptroller of the General Poſt-Office. At that time York races were remarkable for attracting the firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, not only of that immenſe county, but the kingdom at large; and York was then honoured with as many ladies of the firſt diſtinction as gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.—But O what a falling off is there! O woe is me to have ſeen what I have ſeen, and ſeeing what I ſee.—The houſe was full, and the boxes were much crowded; and my only care for the evening was to prepare for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But in regard to my playing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0593400204:20"/>
the Barber, it was not that night fortunate for me that I interfered with the Edwin or the Parſons of York ſtage on that occaſion; and my dreſſing like Woodward, I was afterwards informed, was in every article of it contrary to the dreſs of Mr. Robertſon; and as they pinned their faith upon his ſleeve, why he was right, and I was judged wrong in every particular; therefore abſurd and aſſuming in Wilkinſon to attempt Mr. Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's part of the Barber; he would ſpoil it, and was impudent, ignorant, and deſerved chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I quitted the ſtage the third night with an univerſal hiſs and general marks of diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—It was to me a week of perplexity and woe! not pleaſure, to ſo great a man as <hi>I</hi> had fancied myſelf.</p>
            <p>The next day I accidentally ſtepped into a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lener's ſhop, where a little elderly lady ſat knitting in the corner, and without once looking at me on my entrance (or if ſhe had ſhe would <hi>not</hi> have known me) ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Well, I am ſure, Nanny, you never ſhall perſuade me to go to the play again to ſee that hunch-backed Barber: Give me the Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bride, and Mr. Frodſham, and then there is ſome ſenſe in it: But for that man, that Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as you call him, from London, pray let him go back and ſtay there, for he is the uglieſt man I ever ſaw in my life; and ſo thought Jenny.

It is ſtrange to mention (requeſting an excuſe for the being tedious on ſo trifling and unenter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a ſubject) the contrary effect my acting the Barber in the Upholſterer had on the ſame audience at a diſtant period from this unfortunate week in 1765.—Mr. Woodward, late in April 1771, played four nights at York; and on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday the 27th fixed for his benefit the part of Razor, and of courſe was applauded and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. The ſeaſon following I acted the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and was received <hi>as well</hi> as, and pronounced not only like, but equal to, Woodward; which plainly proves the difference of being an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed favourite or the contrary; and let the reader only ruminate how many actors in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, have voices that give a ſhock and ſeem diſcordant to the ear on firſt reception; yet if any one of thoſe performers are bleſſed with ſterling merit, (without which he will never ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) and the tones become cuſtomary to the ears of the audience, the very voice, which at firſt gave diſguſt, from cuſtom will in a few years become not only familiar but even agreeable, and rejoice the good he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

only from the gods, but every part of a charmed and a reſounding theatre.</p>
            <p>I muſt not forget to mention a very particular circumſtance, which was the cauſe of my having related the foregoing accident, and ſhews how ſtrangely things occur. Know then reader, that in October 1768 (only three years after Mrs. Doughty's unfavourable opinion of me) with that ſaid lady's own conſent I actually was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to her daughter Jane, and have this year, 1790, ſtill the honour and happineſs to call that truly good woman my wife, and the Miſs Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's I am proud to call my couſins.</p>
            <p>Not having finiſhed the career of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable race week, I muſt here regiſter that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had not ceaſed plaguing me with my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Barber; for on the night following Mrs. Centlivre's play of the Buſy Body was acted; Marplot, Mr. Frodſham: to which was added my highly-valued tower of ſtrength, my Ville de Paris, called Love A-la-Mode.—Thundering ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and ſhouts of expectation had pleaſingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed my ſleep the night before, with glorious vaſt ideas, ſuch as expecting thanks, and being the topic of admiring converſation, for the <hi>favour</hi> Mr. Wilkinſon had conferred on the town by ſo good and unexpected a feaſt as Mr. Macklin's Love A-la-Mode:—Indeed one material point was gained, for the theatre was crowded in every part.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0593400204:24"/>
The York audience then were particularly luke-warm as to applauſe, when compared to any other eſtabliſhed theatre; for Mr. Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was ſo hurt the firſt night he acted at his reception, that I was under the neceſſity of calling on all my acquaintance the next day to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them Mr. Woodward was ſo chagrined by their coolne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to return to Love A-la-Mode, in which the firſt ſcene being merely introductory, not any applauſe could have been extorted from any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; ſilence and attention was all that could be required, and that was granted. The ſcene of the Jew (Beau Mordecai) followed next:—Not a ſmile; as I ſtood behind the ſcenes on the very tenter hooks of expectation my vanity attributed that only to the want of a little rouſing and my deſired appearance.—A rat-a-tat at the ſtage door, and now for it ſays I.—When I entered as Sir Archy, ſcarcely a hand!—My heart ſunk ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where—no matter where.

               </q>
I tried and tried, but all in vain; the ſcene drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and grew more and more dull: Next came Sir Callaghan, whom I was truly glad to ſee, as

it relieved me from a heavy tedious courtſhip with the lady which did not promiſe much better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs—any change, I truſted, would be for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—They gave applauſe on ſeeing Frodſham, and a few ſimpering ſmiles gave me a cheerer, and I judged all would be for the better. But when I as Sir Archy, and he as Sir Callaghan were left to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the quarrelling ſcene, which is truly well executed by the author, and very entertaining, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of peals of laughter, which I had aſſured my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would follow, and to my ſpeeches in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the full aſſemblage before us ſeemed as if by magnetiſm charmed into an evening's nap—all was huſh—they appeared perfectly willing to grant leave for our departure—we ended the act, but not with any honours to grace the remembrance—and indeed by the turn of faces in the boxes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every other part, it was very perceptible the actors or the piece were by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.

and diſappointed from having expected too much, felt chagrined, and were ſlow as to giving the leaſt encouragement; and it might truly be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not Love A-la-Mode that night, but the farce of Croſs Purpoſes. I for my own part, as an actor, never felt ſo ſevere a diſappointment, and wiſhed for the week over, as I could then take my leave of York for ever.</p>
            <p>While the muſic was playing, preparatory to the ſecond act, Frodſham flew eagerly to get relief from his fatal and falſe friend, the brandy bottle. I was not quite ſo raſh, but was contented with ſending for a bottle of Madeira, of which I took large and eager libations.— <q>
                  <l>If thus a man can die</l>
                  <l>Much bolder with brandy.</l> 
                  <l>So I drink off this bumper, and now I can ſtand the teſt,</l>
                  <l>And my comrades ſhall ſee that I die as brave as the beſt.</l>
               </q>
Thus armed (after a tedious muſic) by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the invincible ſpirit of wine, I felt bold, and ſallied forth once more to take the field. I had to Frodſham confeſſed myſelf diſappointed and hurt, however ſubmiſſive reſignation to the decrees of the Fates was indiſpenſable; and as an honeſt witneſs on a trial often gives weight to the jury, ſo did I reſt hopes on my Squire Groom's ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

all matters right; and I predicted, that when the curtain dropped I ſhould be envious of his receiving all the honours and praiſes that would, from the part being ſo applicable to the week, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure good fortune. When Squire Groom made his <hi>entrée</hi> in his new dreſs and <hi>aw</hi> his potificalibus, exactly as Mr. King had accoutred himſelf at London when he acted that part; why even there my hopes were fruſtrated, for his being dreſſed as a gentleman who had been riding his own match, gave offence inſtead of being pleaſing to the gentlemen of the turf; it was ſneered at as impertinently taking too great a liberty in the race week to have any freedom of character, or even to be permitted to paſs, at a time when the whole dependence of the theatre reſted on the reſort of company that attended York races.—Squire Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

cared for the audience, the farce, nor the actors, but found themſelves in the theatre they ſcarce knew how, and as peaceably departed they hardly knew why. Now let me ſpeak in my own defence as to my merit in acting the part of Sir Archy: Firſt, In the Scotch dialect I was very happy, having naturally a nice ear, and alſo repeated opportunities of improvement by having reſided two winters in Scotland.—In that point I certainly had the advantage even of Mr. Macklin, yet not too Scotch for an Engliſh audience (for that may be poſſible), as an actor may pronounce Scotch too well for a London audience, and yet that would be exactly right at Edinburgh. I could ſpeak Sir Archy without fear at Covent Garden theatre, but would not by any means at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a Scotch character at Edinburgh, though I have been much honoured by their partiality; but at Newcaſtle, one hundred miles ſouth of Edinburgh, I was accounted a good actor, as to the dialect, and would have ſeemed ſtill better at York, and ſuperior to York again if I acted the part in London; as the purity of the language is naturally leſs underſtood the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the country, than in or on the borders of Scotland; and the performers in London, not acquainted with Yorkſhire, ſubſtitute the Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire dialect inſtead of the northern, which is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0593400204:30"/>
quite oppoſite: but to the London galleries the ſubſtitute anſwers full as well; as, <hi>iſe zure,</hi> &amp;c. fulfils every idea of a Cockney's common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. As to my playing the character, I was perfect to a letter, and knew every other part, and had fully comprehended and executed Sir Archy in Mr. Macklin's manner—to do which I was competent: So the fault I may ſay, as to its being ſo unfavourably received, did not originate entirely from bad acting; in ſhort, it was no more t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have ſeen Mr. Moſſop, when in Dublin, have a crowded houſe, with his name the only one thought of in the whole play-bill; yet by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic being there glutted with too many good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and from the frequency of feaſting at the temple of Parnaſſus, they grew ſurfeited; and after that, Mr. Moſſop, aided by Mrs. Fitzhenry, and the well-known and admired Miſs Catly, with an additional band, all combined, have performed to 5l.</p>

Before I had acted the farce of Love A-la-Mode at York, I aſſured myſelf it would be called for, and draw great houſes on the Friday and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday following; but the theatrical atmoſphere continued dark, gloomy, and tempeſtuous, and I, after the ſtorm was over, retired to bed, where I ſulked moſt part of the following day.—I begged to be excuſed from any duty on the Friday: The Maid of the Mill was acted by Mrs. Mahon to a full houſe; Mr. Robertſon performed the Mock Doctor, and I had not ſeen the audience ſo truly entertained in the courſe of the week.</p>
            <p>The Saturday we concluded with the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Felix, Mr. Frodſham; to which I tacked the Minor, which was well received, and there I got much credit, as well as in the Lyar, that week; and though I loved applauſe (for who does not), the medicine came too late.—I made my bow, the curtain dropped, and, as I judged, for poſitively the laſt time with Tate Wilkinſon as a performer on that ſtage.—But, ah me! our reſolutions too much reſemble April weather, and are a mere ſhadowy mixture of ſunſhine, clouds, and ſhowers, and what we do determine oft we break. <hi>And ſo and ſo</hi> (as fooliſh Becky ſays) there ended my York race-week 1765, but not without a ſcourge for my vanity.—I inwardly ſaid (and ſolemnly) <q rend="inline">"Farewell, Old York, on

            <p>The York company ſet off on the Monday for Beverley, its uſual place of reſidence at that time, for four or five weeks before the Hull ſeaſon.—Mr. Baker (as he was fully convinced I had no temptation to allure me again into Yorkſhire) behaved moſt liberally for my trouble during the race-week, and he wiſhed, as I was in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that I would try a ſhort ſeaſon at Hull, which he augured would anſwer mutually for our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and be much more profitable than at any other time, if I made a journey on purpoſe for Hull only.—Mr. Baker's arguments were feaſible: Hull was a new ſpot, and I yielded to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and liked it better, as that place had the charms of inticing novelty to allure me.</p>
            <p>We will here imagine the York company ſolacing themſelves at pleaſant Beverley, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf idle, ſulky, and full of chagrin at York, rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating on the late diſappointments, with all my vain glories tarni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

or the young who have heard much of that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, will be pleaſed with a deſcription of him, I have therefore in this niche placed him; and that the almoſt ſurfeited reader, after patiently poring over ſo much playhouſe matter, may either ſit ſtill and proceed with inſpecting this poor monument, or lay down the book and ſeek a more pleaſing or profitable recreation, I ſhall here give (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my beſt recollection) a conciſe ſketch of the once much-talked-of, and the now almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Frodſham, who was thirty years ago term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the York Garrick.</p>
            <p>The abilities of that performer were unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:—He was naturally a good actor in ſpite of himſelf; for tho' London improves and matures, and is the moſt enviable theatrical ſituation, yet genius will be found in every rank, ſoil, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Mr. Frodſham had a quick genius, aided by a liberal education: He was ſon of an ancient family in Cheſhire, of the town of Frodſham, ten miles from Cheſter, being the half way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Wigan and Cheſter:—But his mind, his underſtanding, and ſuperabundant good qualities, were all warped and undermined by nocturnal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; which failings unfortunately were ſupplied by refreſhing pulls at the brandy-bottle in the morning, to take off all qualms from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, till the certain conſequence enſued of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0593400204:34"/>
enfeebled, diſordered, mad, dropſical, and dead at the age of thiry-five.—With proper cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he would have been a good ſubſtitute for Barry—I do not ſay that would have done in his latter ſtate, but it would have been the caſe had he encountered London ſome years before he fell into ſuch poiſonous conduct to himſelf; and then he was the idol, which the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of was the ſupport of his fame on his latter years' performance.—He was awkward merely from the want of modelling, and worſe, by being told, from his drunken inferiors, off the ſtage, that all he did was right: But had he been caught at a proper time, while wild, by ſuch a man as Mr. Garrick, and that Mr. G. would have really taken pains with him, the York hero would have done honour to London. In my experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and beſt obſervation his Hamlet (and Jaffier ſtill better) with all his eccentricity, I never ſaw equalled but by Mr. Garrick and Mr. Barry at that time; (and of that period I am ſpeaking, not of the preſent day;) though Mr. Kembel's judgment may challenge what I ſay; as, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>his</hi> various excellencies in that character, where the play is performed in the third act, the execution is not only ſpirited, and poſſeſſes great feeling and fire, but the manner of conceiving thoſe paſſage, and conveying them to the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0593400204:35"/>
is ſuperior by Mr. Kemble to that of any other actor's whatever in my remembrance.—But I am now ſpeaking of an exuberant rude flower of the drama, poſſeſſed of voice, with melody and merit, all conſidered to an eminent degree: He had ſtrong feelings, and tears at will; and had he been a few years under the correction of a Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don audience, and attentive to his good adviſers, he would in all probability, long before this, have been in his meridian, and at this time a ſetting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſun. There is a coarſe picture at York in the print-ſhops, of which portrait I cannot ſay the ſame of more expenſive ones; for it not only is very like his perſon, attitude, &amp;c. but is what a picture of real worth ſhould be—it is a ſtrong conveyance without giving elegance, which he by no means ever attained, though his admirers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him certainly what he had not; and the ſaid trifling print does not make him <hi>outré</hi> as to awkwardneſs, but it juſt conveys him in Frod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham's manner and mode as an actor. One of the ſtrongeſt likeneſſes I ever was ſurpriſed with was when favoured with a ſight of Mr. Garrick's picture, at full length, in the character of Richard the Third, at Sir Watkin William Wynn's, St. James's-Square:—I turned ſuddenly round, and was actually aſtoniſhed—for there I ſaw my old maſter juſt as I had ſeen him in his life-time.</p>
            <p>

Mr. Powell of London, who the ſtage had cauſe to lament, is the neareſt aſſimilation I can give of Frodſham. Mr. Powell had the opportunity of ſtrictly obſerving real artiſts, Garrick, and Barry, in all their modes and ſhapes of grief—Inattentive Frodſham unhappily was his own maſter, and a careleſs one; for though he ſet himſelf difficult taſks, he only now and then purſued the trump of fame with ardency or alacrity, but lagged, and never reached the goal, though a very little ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and jockeyſhip would have made him come in firſt, and won many a theatrical plate. The public were ſo infatuated (and indeed he was ſo ſuperior) that he caſt all others at a diſtance in his York ſituation; and the audience too blindly and too partially (for his good) approved all he did beyond compariſon; and when in full pride, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wilfully ſunk himſelf, I do not think any actor but Garrick would have been liked ſo well; and even Garrick, not without ſome old maids' opinions at a ſecret cabal, where Frodſham would have been voted ſuperior, and under the roſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the man for the ladies: Nor would that deciſion in favour of Frodſham have been from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0593400204:37"/>
circumſtance for that young gentleman to be ſo much ſuperior to all the reſt of the York com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: No actors of high degree were at that time ever known thoſe boards to tread, nor was he ever more than ten days in London. Thus ſituated at 1l. 1s. per week ſalary, Frodſham had not any opportunity for obſervation or improvement:—no infringement was ſuffered, or change of characters. Nay, ſo tenacious was old Mr. Criſp<note n="*" place="bottom">An old actor at York.</note>, that it was ſome time, I believe, before he could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to reſign Hamlet to Frodſham and act the ghoſt. Criſp kept Richard, Frodſham acted Richmond—Criſp, Sir John Brute, Frod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham merely Colonel Balby. Frodſham, beſides his tragic abilities, acted ſome ſuch parts as Lord Hardy, Young Bevil, Lord Townly, Sir George Airy, ſung very tolerably, and was a very decent Macheath. About thirty-two years ago he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a fortnight for holidays, which occaſioned great lamentations at York, for they were certain if Mr. Garrick ſaw Frodſham it would be a woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day for the York ſtage. He not only was young and vain, but ſelf-opinionated to a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant degree. When in London he left a card at Mr. Garrick's houſe, <q rend="inline">"Mr. Frodſham of York,"</q> with the ſame eaſe and facility as if it had
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0593400204:38"/>
been the firſt gentleman from Yorkſhire. Mr. Garrick judged this card of a <hi>country ſtroller</hi> very eaſy and very extraordinary, and from the ſample wiſhed to ſee the York actor, who had according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admittance the enſuing day; and after a ſlight converſation, during which Garrick was aſtoniſhed at the young man's being ſo very free and affable, particularly on any ſubject pertaining to Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare's plays, &amp;c. and ſtill with a procraſtination that Garrick was not accuſtomed to, or by any means reliſhed a compliance with, he delayed, every minute expecting that Frodſham would preſent his petition to be heard, and receive his <hi>commendation</hi> from Garrick's eye of favour: But this obſequious requeſt not being made, Garrick urged preſent buſineſs, and preſented the York Romeo with an order for the pit, deſiring him that night to favour him with attendance to ſee him perform Sir John Brute, accompanied with an invitation to breakfaſt the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

lucky hit.—Frodſham replied, <q rend="inline">"O yes, certainly, my dear Sir, vaſtly clever in ſeveral paſſages; but I cannot ſo far ſubjoin mine to the public opinion of London, as to ſay, I was equally ſtruck with your whole performance in that part."</q>—I do not conjecture that any actor who ſpoke to Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick ever ſo amazed him.—Garrick ſtammered and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Why—why now, to be ſure now, why I ſuppoſe you in the country—Pray now, Mr. Frodſham, what ſort of a place do you act in at York?

And though Garrick himſelf told me the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and truly laughed then, yet I am certain at the time he had been greatly piqued, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſurpriſed at ſo ſtrange a viſit from a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Garrick as good ſuperintendant, waiting with impatience, and full of various conjectures why the <hi>poor</hi> man from the country did not take courage and proſtrate before the foot of majeſty, humbly requeſting a trial, engagement, &amp;c.; but as Frodſham did not, as expected, break the ice, Garrick did.—<q rend="inline">"Well, Mr. Frodſham, why now, well, that is, I ſuppoſe you ſaw my Brute laſt night?—Now no compliment, but tell Mrs. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick; well now, was it right?—Do you think it would have pleaſed at York?

is poſſible that laſt remark was a juſt one.)

               </gap>mplicity in Scrub, and archneſs of eye in Don John, was equally excellent and as various:—On Frodſham, the eye of terror had no ſuch effect; for if he had noticed and thought Mr. Garrick's eyes were penetrating, he would inwardly have comforted himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his own were equally brilliant, if not ſuperiorly ſo. When Frodſham had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hamlet's firſt ſpeech, and without ſtop, <hi>To be or not to be,</hi> &amp;c. Garrick ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Well, hey now! hey! you have a ſmattering, but you want a little of my forming; and really in ſome paſſages you have acquired tones I do not by any means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove." Frodſham tartly replied, "Tones, Mr. Garrick! to be ſure I have tones, but you are not familiarized to them. I have ſeen you act twice, Hamlet the firſt, and I thought you had odd tones, and Mrs. Cibber ſtrange tones, and they were not quite agreeable to me on the firſt hearing, but I dare ſay I ſhould ſoon be reconciled to them."—"Why now," ſays the much aſtoniſhed wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Garrick, "nay, now that is—why now really Frodſham, you are a d—d queer fellow—but for a fair and full trial of your genius my ſtage
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0593400204:43"/>
ſhall be open, and you ſhall act any part you pleaſe, and if you ſucceed we will then talk of terms." "O!" ſays Frodſham, in the ſame flighty flow of ſpirits, "you are miſtaken, my dear Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, if you think I came here to ſolicit an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; I am a Roſcius at my own quarters! I came to London purpoſely to ſee a few plays, and looking on myſelf as a man not deſtitute of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, I judged it a proper compliment to wait on a brother genius: I thought it indiſpenſable to ſee you, and have half an hour's converſation with you—I neither want nor wiſh for an engagement; for I would not abandon or relinquiſh the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I enjoy in Yorkſhire for the firſt terms your great and grand city of London could afford;"</q> and with a negligent wild bow made his exit, and left the gazing Garrick following his ſhade, like Shakſpeare's ghoſt, himſelf ſtanding in an attitude of ſurpriſe, to ruminate and reflect, and to relate this account of the ſtrangeſt mad actor he had ever ſeen, or ever after did ſee. Mr. Garrick told me theſe particulars himſelf, and a narrative much of the ſame purpoſe I had from Mr. Frod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham when I became acquainted with him in Yorkſhire. Mr. Garrick declared he never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held ſuch a ſtrange mixture of merit and genius, as in that <hi>eccentric</hi> Frodſham; and Frodſham, without any idea of offence, weakly judged that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0593400204:44"/>
his fame was equally known with the other great man's; and he was determined ſuch an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed actor as the York idol ſhould not be deemed rude by being in London and not viſiting his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hamlet's altar. Frodſham's remarks were rude, and not true, relative to tones; for Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick ſpoke Hamlet as naturally and void of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tones as ever was heard, his voice being remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably harmonious, ſtrong, and pleaſing, though in his heſitation and repetition, off the ſtage, he threw it into an affected manner, which habit had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into nature. As to Mrs. Cibber's Ophelia, though I have ſeen many good ones I have not ſeen her like, nor ever expect it, as her ſinging, voice, figure, and features, all combined, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let me bury in oblivion her remembrance.—<q>
                  <l>They all wither'd when my poor father died.</l>
                  <l>Methinks I ſee her now!</l>
                  <l>Where?</l>
                  <l>In my mind's eye, Horatio.</l>
               </q> But tones, until familiarized, may prevent favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite comedians, till their merit is eſtabliſhed, from having their voice reliſhed and approved. When I firſt heard Mr. Quick his voice did not much pleaſe me: Now I never hear the ſound of it, even from behind the ſcenes, but I am as eager as any other attendant involuntarily to laugh, it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0593400204:45"/>
has to me ſo whimſical and very agreeable an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. With the tragedian this apparent difficulty is n t ſo eaſily got over: Ryan's voice was bad to a degree, ſo was Mrs. Woffington's: Ryan, by having merit and worth, was ſanctioned; and Mrs. Woffington, by the aid of beauty and merit, was a great favourite in Jane Shore, Lady Jane Gray, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but theſe are wonderful hazards to encounter.</p>
            <p>Before I quit Mr. Frodſham's mode of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour at London, I muſt inform the reader, that the ſaid harum-ſcarum young gentleman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he waited on Johnny Rich of Covent Garden theatre, that manager he feared would arraign him of being deficient in point of good-breeding, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he had not the leaſt inclination to beſtow an hour on that gentleman; as he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Mr. Rich's genius was ſuperficial, and ſuppoſing he neither underſtood plays, Greek, nor Latin, but encouraged pantomime only, he held him in the greateſt contempt.—Indeed the applauſe at York he commanded, and received from every alehouſe, had intoxicated his brain as much as the plentiful potations of <hi>York burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> with which, and other pleaſant ſpirited draughts, he too ſoon finiſhed his early days of life and fame: He had by the lower people been ſo loaded with more fancied honours than he could carry, that he had not a ſerious after-reflection or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0593400204:46"/>
thought to inform him he had acted wrong in his deportment, manners, and behaviour to Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick: He knew Garrick's great fortune, and his own <hi>no fortune at all,</hi> but allowed no profeſſional ſuperiority in talents, &amp;c.; and when he ſpoke to Mr. Garrick, he ſaid, he of courſe ſuppoſed that Mr. Garrick knew he was ſpeaking to as good a gentleman as himſelf, and an actor on much the ſame footing of merit: For the bravos and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement he received in his beſt days at York were certainly flattering; and from thoſe cauſes, combined with his own ſelf-opinion, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to him that he was ſecure of the higheſt opinion from all the nobility of England, becauſe a few ſaw him in a York race-week. With Rich he met with a very different reception from that of the Drury Lane patentee: He found him teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young lady to act, with three or four cats about him. After his being ſome time in the room, when announced, Rich viewed him through a very large reading-glaſs, took his ſnuff, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Well, Mr. Frogſmire, I ſuppoſe you are come from York to be taught, and that I ſhould give you an engagement: Did you ever act Richard, Mr. Frogſmire?"—"Yes, Sir."—"Why then you ſhall hear me act,"</q> ſays Rich:—when he ſpoke a ſpeech in a moſt ridiculous manner: And on its being concluded, Frodſham pettiſhly told him he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0593400204:47"/>
did not viſit him nor come from York to be taught nor to hear him act; he came (like Lord Chalkſtone) merely for a little converſation, and to view his Elyſian fields. But as Mr. Rich loved leiſure, and had little curioſity, he replied, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Muſter</hi> Frogſmire would with humble atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hear his Richard, he would not hear Mr. Frogſmire at all. Frodſham was preparing to make an exit, while Rich was ruminating and proceeding with— <q>
                  <l>'Twas an excuſe to avoid me!</l>
                  <l>Alas ſhe keeps no bed!</l>
               </q>
When he was ſuddenly interrupted by Mr. Frod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham with, <q rend="inline">"I wiſh you good morning!"</q> and ſo ended unthinking Frodſham's ſecond managerial viſit.—He returned to Ebor's plains, and was joyfully received there.—He was not forgot by Garrick, as he often, to his performers, related the ſtory of that <hi>mad York actor,</hi> as he termed him: And Rich, without thinking of any ſuch trifling occurrence, continued teaching young pupils to act, ſtroked his cats, and the York Roſcius was never more by him remembered.</p>
            <p>The laſt night Frodſham, ever ſpoke on the ſtage was in October 1768. After playing Lord Townly, and though in apparent great ſpirits, he died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three days after.—<q rend="inline">"Ladies and gentlemen,

            <p>I will here take it for granted, that the reader has ruminated on giddy Frodſham's exit from the world's ſtage, and once more reſume my diſcourſe to inform the peruſer, that during my few days retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Mr. Baker's, after the races, I received the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of an invitation from Mr. Whitely, director of the Doncaſter theatre, requeſting I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a few nights there after the races, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and troop were to attend that meeting, and continue ſome weeks afterwards. The offer exactly tallied with my plan for convenience, as it filled up the ſpace until I ſhould be wanted at Hull, and alſo would add griſt to my mill. I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with good Mr. Baker at my houſe (or rather his) at York, till I went to Doncaſter, and he ſtayed with me till then, out of compliment, for he uſually was with the company. I went, and Mr. Whitely gave bills with a long puff of <q rend="inline">"Walk in and ſee the wonderful great actor he had engaged
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0593400204:49"/>
from London, Dublin, Edinburgh, &amp;c."</q> I acted there three weeks. Miſs Whitely was the young heroine, a very pretty and handſome young lady; ſhe promiſed well as an actreſs, but thank her ſtars ſhe is much better provided for than being obliged to rely on the ſtage. She married Mr. Goſlin of Stamford, where ſhe is happily ſituated, and is juſt as irreſiſtible a woman now as ſhe was a girl then. During my continuance at Donca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter I lived entirely with Mr. Stanuel, who at that time kept the Green Dragon, and to whoſe civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities I was greatly indebted and have never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got; and I am glad of this public opportunity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them, and preſent my thanks to him. Mr. Stanuel now moves on a larger ſcale, and in a more exalted ſphere, as he is maſter of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and much improved inn, well known (and genteelly ſupported) under the name of the Red Lion.</p>
            <p>My benefit play there was the Merchant of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice; my Tea, and Duke and no Duke. It was particularly honoured, with not only being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>on to our little theatre; and no wonder, for beſides the compliment paid to me, Sir George Cooke's mother (who was much beloved by all the families in Doncaſter and its neighbourhood) did me the honour unaſked to patronize my play. Sir George Cooke lives at Wheatly, near Donca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0593400204:50"/>
His own lady inherits every virtue and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing quality, which demands and receives uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reſpect, eſteem, and admiration.</p>
            <p>I returned back to York, and then poſted next day for Beverley, where my friend Mr. Baker waited for me, and after that ceremony eſcorted me to Hull, which was early in the month of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1765.—My firſt appearance was in King Lear. I had every reaſon to be pleaſed, not only from the attention and warm applauſe of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but from the civilities paid me by ſeveral of the leading inhabitants. I ſtudied Zanga; which character was not only there, but after that at <hi>York,</hi> generally looked on as my maſter piece in trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and notwithſtanding the variety of principal performers, it is equally ſpoken of, and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly allowed to be, more than a performance of mediocrity at this day.</p>

After my ſafe eſcape from Colonel Appleton's magiſterial authority, with my baggage-waggons, &amp;c. to Hull races, without capture, where I was received with welcome, I have looked upon it as a duty for the Beverley reſidents to be here made acquainted with the true motives which compelled me to abandon that ſpot; as I have for ſeveral years been much indebted to the inhabitants of that town, of every degree, for their frequent vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations to the Hull theatre, particularly on my own benefit night; for let the weather prove ever ſo diſcouraging, there always has been ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of every deſcription on that occaſion.</p>
            <p>My benefit at Hull on my <hi>firſt viſit</hi> in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1765 was flattering to a degree; not a place in the boxes to be purchaſed but with as much difficulty as if Mr. Garrick was to have acted; ſo I may vaunt of <q rend="inline">"O the days when I was young."</q> My play was The Orphan of China, which had never been acted there: My diſh of Tea, at which there were no qualms, miſconceptions, or abuſe—all went down glibly—The farce was Love A-la-Mode—But the difference of repreſentation, and the opinion of the Hull audience, was ſo indulgent <hi>that night,</hi> as made me feel overpaid for the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and miſhaps that attended my performing Sir Archy at York. I made my beſt bow, my beſt ſpeech, and from the front of the houſe to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0593400204:57"/>
the performers behind the curtain, there was an inſtance of mutual harmony; and not one amongſt them was more pleaſed than my good ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Mr. Baker, with whom I went accidentally to York, meaning to paſs one week, and bid, in all probability, that place an eternal adieu as an actor.</p>
            <p>I had engaged on my own terms with Mr. Ivory, the proprietor, for the whole ſeaſon at Norwich, till the benefits commenced at that town. My quarters were ſecured in the London coach, my baggage all packed, and I was near the eve of my departure from York city that January 1766, being the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On the Thurſday ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral gentlemen waited on Mr. Baker, hearing I was in York, and informed him that many ladies and gentlemen would eſteem themſelves much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to Mr. Wilkinſon's politeneſs if he would aſſiſt the charity for the boys and girls, play on the following Saturday, and favour them ſo far on that night as to oblige them with the farce of Love A-la-Mode, and perform Mr. Macklin's character of Sir Archy Mac Sarcaſm.—Reader, are you not thunder-ſtruck!—but reſt ſatisfied it is no more ſtrange than true. Mr. Baker referred the gentlemen to me, very properly obſerving he had no right to make any requeſt of the kind—the which ceremony they paid me. I was then

Now Quin, with a bottle of claret and a full houſe, the inſtant he was on the ſtage was Sir John Falſtaff himſelf.—<q>

The ſight of the two ancient heroes of antiquity made ſuch a contraſt in the Quartetto, that it ſtruck even my features at the age of eleven with riſibility.

               <p>It is incumbent to remember, though Ryan's figure for Phocyas, Frankley, Sir George Airy, &amp;c. would now appear extravagantly ridiculous, yet on the London boards no actor for a courſe of years could have ſtood more eſteemed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable; and be it obſerved, that in deſpite of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Woodward aſſured me, that when Mr. Garrick went with him to ſee Ryan's Richard the Third, meaning to be inwardly merry, that Garrick, on the contrary, was aſtoniſhed at what he ſaw work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mind of the ungraceful, ſlovenly, and ill-dreſſed figure, which told him more than he before knew, and which cauſed Garrick's bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to light that unknown excellence as his own, which in Ryan had remained unnoticed and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>

At that time, no more than two or three principal characters, (at Covent Garden in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular) were well dreſſed, and thoſe not with any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety as now. Mrs. Woffington's wardrobe had only the increaſe of one tragedy-ſuit, in the courſe of the ſeaſon, in addition to the clothes allotted to her, unleſs ſhe indulged herſelf; and ſhe had a new ſuit for Sir Harry Wildair, in which charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mrs. Woffington looked the man of faſhion; and Mrs. Jordan ſports now in Sir Harry one of the beſt legs in the kingdom. Sir Joſhua Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds is a judge of legs, and has, like Paris with his apple, given his decree on that ſaid leg.</p>
               <p>But the gentlemen and ladies in modern-dreſſed tragedies, forty years ago, at Covent Garden the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, wore the old laced clothes which had done many years ſervice at Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides having graced the original wearers; and the ladies were in large hoops, and the velvet petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats, heavily emboſſed, proved extremely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

of thoſe London theatres were very crazy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, and not pleaſing to the eye: and at preſent the ſtair-caſe to the <hi>upper boxes</hi> at Drury Lane is ſo narrow, that ſhould an alarm of fire happen, the perſons in the two upper tier of boxes would be thrown into ſuch confuſion, ſhould they open at the ſame time the different doors, the paſſage is ſo ſtrait and they would ſo effectually block up each other, that not one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſoul could eſcape, and their increaſing fears would cauſe the ſituation to be alarming and dreadful to a degree. Indeed Covent Garden is not ſo complete in that department (at leaſt it was not ſo when I ſaw that theatre before the late alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations). The upper boxes at Edinburgh are far preferable to thoſe at London for ſeeing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in that reſpect, are better than any theatre I know; and it has an advantage (like Smock-Alley) by the audience part being formed in a well-finiſhed circle. Drury Lane, like London-Bridge, has been much frittered and patched at very great expence; and, after all, the only way to repair will be to pull it down, and erect a new one:—which I underſtand is to be done, and I wiſh for health to ſee it finiſhed.

The conſequence of theſe viſitors, though it gratifies the pride of the audiences, (not forgetting alſo the manager's own <hi>oſtentation,</hi> in the principal theatres remote from the great city) is not always productive, though it gives a glare to enterpriſe; therefore every ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager out of London ſhould watch his farm with as much fear and obſervance as a Weſt Indian planter does a hurricane, which deſtroys his fine proſpect, and he beſtows three quarters of the year in hopes the fourth quarter's produce may make amends for devaſtation:—So the manager, with the little overplus gained, ſhould never lay out what is ſo dearly bought in too laviſh improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a theatre; for the abſence of the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing London favourite leaves a cold chill and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ill-fated blaſt on all theatrical culture for the year to come. Indeed there are always people and money, where faſhion and inclination prompt them to attend a playhouſe, which, when not ſo, the theatre only obtains contempt, falſe pity, and leſs attendance.

Becauſe all the world is there;—not to ſee the play, but to be ſeen. And it is ſurpriſing my own appetite did not inform me this; for if I feed one week on pine-apples, grapes, nectarines, and peaches, I would rather go without fruit the week following than eat common pears, plums, or blackberries. Indeed patents have not only been a ſecurity for theatrical property, but have put the country ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors on a more decent level, which was highly neceſſary; for though there are exceptions from all well-bred perſons, yet an actor in London is

However his projected plan he put in practice; altered the Old Drury-Lane into its preſent form, which now holds conſiderably above 100l. in front more than it did thirty years ago: and, after this beneficial alteration was accompliſhed, by degrees all parties were pleaſed and convinced of its propriety. The comedians had particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to jump for joy, as they received the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit emoluments, without thoſe degrading and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſituations, which intereſt had made them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to. The Covent-Garden managers adopted the ſame change of meaſures, and from that time general admittance and ſtage building, on bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, has ever been prohibited.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſtage remarks have carried my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory back to recollect that the ſame evils ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted in provincial theatres, and in a worſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; as thoſe ſtages (not being formed into an amphitheatre) were without any order or decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, merely rows of forms, one level with the other: for the audience part of thoſe theatres were full large for their uſual ſeaſons of acting; yet on particular benefits, London furniſhed a plea for what might be attempted to render the bad playhouſes worſe than they were before. And the alterations in this reſpect, from Mr. Garrick's reformation of abuſes in London, I ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0593400204:122"/>
led into the ſudden wonderful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, enlargements, and aggrandizing of moſt of our theatres in every principal town and city.</p>
               <p>And as to the article of being freed from beaux behind the ſcenes, a greater bleſſing could not be wiſhed or more devoutly prayed for; as it cannot be conceived how dreadful in the country that would ſometimes prove, (my own ſituation in my hiſtory mentioned at Shrewſbury, is one inſtance) the hauteur and dignity of ſuch viſitants being often ſo inſulting and imperious as not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
               <p>The receipts of the theatres, it is true, ſhould be mentioned. In 1750, two hundred pounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the curtain, at Covent-Garden, was judged an amazing ſum. Now, we hear of upwards of four hundred pounds; but the profits of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I dare pronounce are not equal to Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick's reign, the expences are grown ſo enormous.</p>
               <p>At Dublin, in 1757, one hundred and fifty pounds was a great houſe indeed. In 1763, one hundred and eighty pounds at Crow-Street was ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ged a wonder: but with the late alterations, Mr. Daly had, in July 179<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, three hundred and twenty-four pounds; and he mentions hundreds that could not obtain admittance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0593400204:123"/>
Mr. Garrick was certainly formed to obtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:—and the public, in general, willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to his propoſals (though like man and wife they ſometimes did not agree):—His coffers were always full, and he was too great an oeconomiſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver to empty them by the hand of extravagance:—he locked on his Majeſty's picture with love and reverence, and never parted with his King's likene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s but with the greateſt relu ance.—The expences of the houſe were not then ſo great as at preſent; for when I had a benefit at Covent Garden, 1760, I only paid 60l.; now I believe performers pay 120l.; and if Mrs. Jordan acts on that benefit, it is ten guineas more.</p>
               <p>It is worthy remark, that with all the boaſted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, certainly the goings out are immenſe in proportion to the comings in; and where there was one place open againſt the theatres then, now there are double—ſuch as various new-eſtabliſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certs at Hanover-Square, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

circumſtances? Certainly no. One play got up now will coſt more than three would, fifty years ago. I have heard great arguments of what encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be given by a third theatre inſtead of the preſent, termed monopoly. Were it poſſible to create three induſtrious Mr. Sheridans to write for the ſtage, ſomething might be ſaid and done, but I fear not otherwiſe; and if people in general find their plays not all perfection with two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, I cannot conceive that, divided into three, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0593400204:127"/>
the way to what has grown to an enormous height, but I am certain he never meant the ill effects it has eſtabliſhed. But his Farmer's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, Linco's Travels, &amp;c. wrote as interludes, have conſiderably leſſened the dignity of the drama. It was the practice at my own theatres: I at firſt, on benefit nights, inſiſted on all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes being done as afterludes, but nothing would do, ſo as to keep the play-bills <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Kemble wiſhed, on his night in Auguſt 1788, at York, to introduce the Toy Shop as an interlude, (which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done, and which gave great ſatisfaction on account of his excellent performance of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter); but unleſs he took it as a farce I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled not to ſuffer it, on account of my eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed law, which Mr. Kemble, at the head of the profeſſion, breaking through, would have ſet aſide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I will here give a liſt of the companies at Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden in 1747, that the obſervant reader, unprejudiced, may ſee what a number of eſtabliſhed actors were at that period in one company, and whether there are the ſame number of <hi>equal eminence</hi> to be called ſo at preſent at either Theatre.</p>
               <p>The modern critic and actor will undoubtedly admit that every fifty years will make havock and conſiderable alteration, and what is approved and applauded now, 1790, may not be ſanctioned in 184<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I will firſt give as correct a liſt as I can recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, then preſent the caſt of two or three plays, and then inſtance the caſt of the ſame plays in 1789; by which means the unprejudiced reflector may draw a fair concluſion; and perhaps allow it not quite improbable but the play ſo acted might have been ſeen with equal pleaſure then as now.</p>

               <p>A ſet of very capital dancers was this year at Drury-Lane:—Mr. Cooke, Monſieur Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champs, Madam Auretti, (in the ſerious ſtyle) in great eſtimation, and Madamoiſelle Janeton Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retti.</p>
               <p>A favorite pantomime dance was ſerved up often, called the Savoyard Travellers.</p>

               <p>ALBUMAZER was revived in 1747, by Mr. Garrick, and did not ſucceed.—From which play the circumſtance of the robbery is evidently ſtolen, and converted into Tony Lumpkin's principal ſcene of Dr. Goldſmith's very entertaining Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of "She Stoops to Conquer."</p>

               <p>The Company was very weak indeed.—Mr. Rich, more from lazineſs than lack of genius, had not any pantomime in force, but the then very ſtale one of Merlin's Cave, or Harlequin Skeleton.

               <p>That Mrs. Bellamy remained for ſome time in high eſtimation is well known—but her firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, after her departure from Dublin, was not at Mr. Garrick's theatre, but at Covent-garden, as before mentioned: a true and particular account of which, with Mr. Garrick's <hi>refuſal</hi> to engage her, is given in her Memoirs.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ward was alſo engaged—ſhe was a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome woman, and a good actreſs.</p>
               <p>Coriolanus, by Thompſon, was produced that ſeaſon; in which Mr. Quin, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Delane, Mr. Sparks, Mr. Ridout, Mrs. Bellamy, and Mrs. Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Perſeus and Andromeda was alſo produced, and brought ſeveral houſes—ſo that Mr. Rich then had three pantomimes on the ſtocks: the Skele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Apollo and Daphne and Perſeus. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the <hi>petit maitre</hi> in the laſt mentioned was inimitably done by Mr. Lalmaze; palpably ſtolen by Mr. Woodward, and placed in Queen Mab, at Drury Lane, in the year 1750. The ſcene of the

Dragon, and Perſeus on his flying horſe, with Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meda chained to the rock, the riſing Dome, and the Lion, were the principal parts of that entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and all done well, as was all pantomime buſineſs under the direction of Mr. Rich.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arthur did the clown in that pantomime, in which department he was unrivalled; and well underſtood all the <hi>mechanical</hi> parts of thoſe kind of productions.—Mr. Lowe was Perſeus; Mr. Miles, Harlequin; Miſs Falkener, Andromeda.—Mr. Quin's Falſtaff, and ſeveral of his characters drew great audiences—Mrs. Bellamy was much eſteemed—Mrs. Woffington was attractive in Sir Harry Wildair, &amp;c.—and though Drury-Lane was faſhionable, yet Covent-Garden was reſpectable as to entertainment, and in general well attended.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Cibber did not play. That ſeaſon Mr. Garrick (ſhameful to relate) encouraged Mrs. Ward to break articles with Mr Rich, which ſhe was the eaſier tempted to do, as Miſs Bellamy was in poſſeſſion of moſt of the characters ſhe wiſhed to play. Edward the Black Prince was acted that ſeaſon—Barry gained great ground and honour in Ribemont.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0593400204:149"/>
(King Arthur and the Tempeſt excepted) were, on our Engliſh ſtage, confined to the common ballad farces.—Mr. Beard was, as a vocal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, the beſt actor of SONGS I ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber—Miſs Norris was a charming ſinger—and Paſtora cannot be known but by thoſe who had the pleaſure of ſeeing Mrs. Clive.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cibber having withdrawn was a ſevere ſtroke upon the Drury Lane tragedies, Mrs. Ward being but a cold and inanimate ſubſtitute; and it fell heavier on Mr. Barry's plays than Mr. Garrick's, as Lear, Macbeth, Richard, with Mrs. Pritchard's Lady Macbeth, &amp;c. would do without Mrs. Cibber; but Caſtalio, Romeo, Varanes, &amp;c. were ruined without her helping hand: Indeed Barry refuſed acting Romeo with Mrs. Ward. The Roman Father was brought out that ſeaſon, where Barry in Publius by no means could appear as an actor (though it ſhewed his fine figure) in competition with Garrick. Gil Blas was produced that year and damned, and ſome other pieces, but none of note. Rich not having any thing new, and only repeating the old plays, Lady Jane Gray excepted and the pantomime of the Fair, Drury Lane, unleſs on particular nights, bore the beil. Garrick's comedy characters, as well as his tragedy, (ſuch as Ranger, Benedick,

Archer, Bayes, Lear, Hamlet, &amp;c.) were ſure cards, and all thoſe plays were thoroughly well acted.</p>

               <p>The company much the ſame as the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unleſs the loſs of Mr. Theophilus Cibber: Mr. Dyer from Ireland was his ſubſtitute, a very good actor in ſprightly comedy; not ſtriking as to abilities, but ſure to pleaſe, and never to offend. He played ſeveral parts of Mr. Garrick's, ſuch as Ranger, &amp;c. and in Tom was truly excellent;—that was his firſt part at Covent. Garden. Mr. Dyer's figure was very neat, not unlike that of Mr. Lewis's of Covent Garden; but it would be paying Mr. Lewis a very bad complement to draw a compariſon in any other reſpect, as that gentleman's vivacity, neatneſs, ſpirit, and energy of expreſſion, is ſo ſuperior as to caſt Mr. Dyer's abilities at a diſtance, were he now living; as wherever Mr. Lewis's Vapid, Twineall, Mercutio, &amp;c. are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t oned, which he ſupports with a peculiar whim and vivacity, he by that means ſends hundreds joyful to their reſpective homes: In truth he needs no eulogium, as the trueſt praiſe is deſervedly thus, that whether Mr. Lewis had pleaſed the audience in 1700, 1790, or in 1810, he would have an equal claim to the generoſity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0593400204:151"/>
and approbation of a ſenſible, generous, and diſcerning public.</p>

That year Mr. Rich produced a little ſketch of a pantomime called the Fair, in which Mr. Lun (Rich) did Harlequin.

               <p>Romeo and Juliet was revived in the interim between Quin and Woffington's playing—Romeo, Mr. Lee; Juliet, Miſs Bellamy.

               <p>Miſs Bellamy was engaged from Covent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and trained as the Juliet—Woodward was the Mercutio. Mr. Garrick divided the opinion of the town as to his performance in Romeo—Mr. Rich's proceſſion was very grand, and in thoſe ſpectacles he never had been equalled, nor can be ſurpaſſed; but Garrick did not promiſe any proceſſion or dirge in his bills, tho' they gave a ſtriking effect and an agreeable ſurpriſe.—Mr. Woodward aſſiſted Mr. Garrick with Queen Mab

that ſeaſon, which eaſed Garrick much; and the comedies were ſo well ſuſtained, where Mr. Woodward, Mr. Yates, Mr. Taſwell, Mrs. Pritchard, and Mrs. Clive, were capital, that the fairy wand ſailed with the old Drury hulk before the wind. A whimſical print was then produced, called the Steel Yards, in in which were placed Quin, Barry, Woffington, and Cibber; and in oppoſition Woodward and Queen Mab, which exultingly bore down all the greater load with the ſmall.

and Barry Quin—and Mrs. Cibber and Mrs. Woffington held each other in the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.—Mrs. Cibber, when called upon by the manager, was often feignedly or really ill; and though Mrs. Woffington was ever ready for any undertaking for the general welfare, yet that year her pride was touched and irritated ſo much, that by a refuſal one night a great riot enſued, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned in Vol. III.</p>
               <p>Quin and Barry were alſo averſe to aſſiſt each other.—King John was called to rehearſal, and Barry was not there. Quin would not attend the next rehearſal; and what Barry ſettled, Quin was ſure, when he came, to contradict.</p>

But Mrs. Cibber's excellence was of that ſuperior kind, that I can only retain her in my mind's eye. Not that all her characters were equally aſtoniſhing; for Mrs. Cibber was but a mere mortal: yet, her Alicia, Conſtance, Ophelia, Indiana, Juliet, &amp;c. were truly her own. Neat ſimplicity of manners in comedy was equally ſo. But her fine Ladies, and

parts of ſtriking humour, had better be (as they are) forgotten. This is a great character, but a juſt one.</p>

               <p>Mr. Quin had retired from the ſtage May 1751; in March 1752, and March 1753, he came from Bath purpoſely to play Falſtaff in the firſt part of King Henry IV. for his friend Mr. Ryan's bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: He after that left him a legacy, and made him a preſent; declaring he grew infirm, and would not <hi>whiſtle</hi> Falſtaff.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Woffington continued in Ireland; ſo Mr. Barry and Mrs. Cibber had all their own ſway.—The Siege of Damaſcus was revived—Barry, Phocyas; and Mrs. Cibber, Eudocia. Mrs. Cibber alſo played Lady Townly, (not much to her credit). Venice Preſerved was likewiſe acted, when Barry made his appearance as Jaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier. He had uſually played Pierre, and his figure was pleaſing and commanding beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in that character. Mrs. Cibber's Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videra was a non-ſuch.—Mr. Rich revived that year the Necromancer, or Harlequin Doctor Fauſtus; the galleries liked ſuch a diſmal ſight then, but I do not think it would be now tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.

               <p>Mr. Smith's ſecond part on the ſtage was Southampton, in the play of Eſſex.—Mrs. Cib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber's benefit that year was All for Love, with her neat little piece of the Oracle.</p>

She threw ſtrokes in many paſſages that were not only genuine but forcible, and bad fair in time to ſupply the place of a Cibber;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0593400204:178"/>
but notwithſtanding the advantages of youth, and meeting wonderful encouragement, Nature had not endowed her with voice and powers ſufficient for the arduous taſk to ſtand againſt her rival, and they appeared weakened, the more ſhe was ſeen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of gaining ground.—Indeed I think I never ſaw her play ſo well as the firſt ſeaſon; neither was her voice muſical, and her mouth was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably wide, but ſhe drew to all her characters. She acted Juliet a number of nights. Her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part was Belvidera, and in the mad ſcene did wonders from tuition, attention, and ſtrong underſtanding: Rutland the third; and Philoclea, brought forward and wrote purpoſely to ſhew her to advantage by Macnamara Morgan.—Mr. Barry took infinite pains with Pyrocles; Mr. Smith did Muſidorus; but the tragedy was a ſtrange, lame, ſick play, and with difficulty languiſhed till the ninth day, when poor Philoclea died a natural death, and was not baſely and cruelly murdered, as Mrs. Bellamy falſely and invidiouſly relates, as Mr. Smith can teſtify; for, on the contrary, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe was ſo violent the firſt night of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Iriſh gentlemen's party ſo ſtrong in its ſupport, that Mrs. Bland was obliged to repeat a coarſe epilogue, which was as coarſely ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Conſtantine was alſo produced at Covent-Garden that year, and ſhared an unhappy fate.

               <p>Miſs Bellamy muſt have been determinably wrong as to her account of Conſtantine being damned the firſt night of repreſentation: It was firſt acted on Saturday, February 23, 1754; alſo on the Monday and Tueſday following: The third <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

ſome time, as that tragedy was with difficulty hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thro', the Empreſs Fulvia being brought to bed that very fourth night, and like a woman of ſpirit ſhe appeared ſoon after in the penitent Jane Shore for her own benefit: Mr. Foote acted in the Knights that ſaid evening, and gave an imitation of Mr. Garrick in the prologue, who had wrote and ſpoke that ſeaſon the following lines:— <q>
                     <l>I read no Greek, Sir—When I was at ſchool</l>
                     <l>Terence wrote prologues—Terence was no fool.</l>
                  </q>
Which lines Foote thus ridiculed, and in manner very like the Garrick, and with effect:—<q>
                     <l>I read no Greek, Sir—When I was at ſchool</l>
                     <l>The uſher wrote prologues—the uſher was no fool.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Miſs Bellamy mentions alſo the great expence Mr. Rich was at in reviving Buſirus, which is a dream of her own invention, as Mr. Barry revived that play Monday, March 22, 1756, for his own benefit, two years LATER than her account, and was acted to a very indifferent houſe. The ſtage was built, but the ſeats were empty. Mr. Foote acted Hartop in the Knights that evening, to oblige and ſerve Mr Barry.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy alſo relates, that on her return to Covent Garden, on her appearing in Juliet with Barry, that the tragedy had a run exceeding
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0593400204:182"/>
that of oppoſition 1750. It is ſo little connected with truth, and is ſo very erroneous, that on the contrary, when ſhe returned to Covent Garden on the ſeaſon's opening in the autumn 1754, Miſs Noſſiter was, as before-mentioned in my Memoirs, the Juliet; which character Miſs Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy at that time never had acted with Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor ever did till ſo late as the 26th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1755. Her firſt appearance in 1753, on her return, was on Tueſday the 20th of November, in a very improper character; as was her ſecond on Thurſday, November 22 (her ſituation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered): She was thus announced in the bills, <q rend="inline">"Athenais, by Miſs Bellamy, her firſt appearance this ſtage theſe three years."</q> After the chaſte Athenais, the pure Monimia followed, which led to ſtrange ideas that Caſtalio moſt certainly had been acquainted with that lady long before the third act. After that ſeaſon (and not before it was neceſſary) ſhe wiſely changed the appellation of <hi>Miſs</hi> to <hi>Mrs.</hi> Bellamy.</p>
               <p>That lady's life being publiſhed, my own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and intimacy with her as an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, friend, and actreſs, will not, I hope, make the following genuine letters unexceptionable, as it draws as near to the finiſh of that once admired

The impoſitions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, as the people live by the diſtreſſes of others.

                     <p>When I parted from you at Doncaſter, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, long before this, to have met with ſome oddities worth acquainting you with. It is grown a faſhion of late to write lives:—I have now, and for a long time have had, leiſure enough to undertake mine—but want materials for the latter part of it: For my exiſtence now cannot properly be called living, but what the painters term <hi>ſtill life;</hi> having, ever ſince February 13, been confined in this town gaol for a London debt.</p>
                     <p>As a hunted deer is always ſhunned by the happier herd, ſo am I deſerted by the company<note n="*" place="bottom">Norwich Company.</note>, my ſhare taken off, and no ſupport left me, ſave what my wife can ſpare me out of hers.</p>

my little garriſon; but then it has been with the aid of my good friends and allies—my clothes—This week's eating finiſhes my laſt waiſtcoat; and next I muſt atone for my errors on bread and water.</p>

                        <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> had ſo many towns to furniſh his table; and a whole city bore the charge of his meals. In ſome reſpects I am like him; for I am furniſhed by the labours of a multitude.—A wig has fed me two days—the trimmings of a waiſtcoat as long—a pair of velvet breeches paid my waſher woman, and a ruffled ſhirt has found me in ſhaving.—My coats I ſwallowed by degrees: The ſleeves I breakfaſted upon for weeks—the body, ſkirts, &amp;c. ſerved me for din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner two months.—My ſilk ſtockings have paid my lodgings, and two pair of new pumps ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to ſmoke ſeveral pipes. It is incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how my appetite (barometer like) riſes in proportion as my neceſſities make their terrible advances. I here could ſay ſomething droll about a good ſtomach; but it is ill jeſting with edge tools, and I am ſure that's the ſharpeſt thing about me.—You may think I can have no ſenſe of my condition, that while I am thus wretched, I ſhould offer at ridicule: But, Sir, people conſtitutioned like me, with a diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate levity of ſpirits, are always moſt merry,

when they are moſt miſerable; and quicken like the eyes of the conſumptive; which are always brighteſt the nearer a patient approaches to diſſolution.—However, Sir, to ſhew you I am not entirely loſt to all reflection, I think myſelf poor enough to want a favour, and humble enough to aſk it here.—Sir, I might make an encomium on your good-nature and humanity, &amp;c.—but I ſhall not pay ſo bad a compliment to your underſtanding, as to endeavour, by a parade of phraſes, to win it over to my intereſt. If you could, any night at a concert, make a ſmall collection for me, it might be a means of obtaining my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and you well know, Sir, the firſt people of rank abroad will perform the moſt friendly offices for the ſick: Be not, therefore, offended at the requeſt of a poor (though a deſervedly puniſhed) debtor.</p>

It was falſely reported, that Mr. Barry refuſed playing Oreſtes, fearing her ſucceſs ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with Miſs Noſſiter's.—The ſtory gained ſuch credit, that he judged it neceſſary to publiſh an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement in all the papers, contradicting the malicious propagation. That lady grew into the higheſt faſhion afterwards at the Dublin theatre: She married a gentleman bred to the bar in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; a Mr. Fitzhenry, a gentleman of family and abilities; and took leave of the public at Dublin, within theſe four or five ſeaſons; having wiſely provided, from her gains on the ſtage, to live decently and comfortably off.—After all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The company remained much as the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Mr. Garrick was truly inimitable in Don John.—Mrs. Clive was equal in the Mother.

               <p>Barbaroſſa was produced that year, and was much followed.—The Chances, revived and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Mr. Garrick, at the command of his late Majeſty, had a great run;—and Coriolanus was g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Garrick was a quick gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and it is moſt probable Mr. Moſſop would not have had the luck of that play being produced at ſuch expence, but that Mr. Garrick was eager to get the ſtart of the rival theatre, where it was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with infinite pomp and ſplendour.

were the deſperate undertakers after Sheridan's abdication.—Miſs Noſſiter, (Mr. Barry's favourite Juliet) made a point of having five hundred pounds; and Mrs. Gregory (who had only appeared in two characters the winter before, at Covent-Garden; once in Hermione, and in Alicia twice; once for Mr. Sparks, and another night for Mrs. Bellamy), at three hundred pounds.—Barry on his departure from England denounced ruin on Mr. Rich by his deſertion; but ſuch threats were weak in the extreme: It is true, Mr. Sheridan's Romeo was vain and ridiculous, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Barry's; but Barry forgot that with the aid and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mr. Sheridan, by the great riot in Dublin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to leave that city, occaſioned by the repreſentation of Mahomet in February 1754; in which perturbation Mrs. Woffington was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have aided, as a party concerned in <hi>real</hi> ſtate politics, which certainly has not any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection or buſineſs within the walls of a theatre, that lady was alſo obliged to retire from Ireland, at the ſame time, with Mr. Sheridan.</p>

It is one of the moſt remarkable riots that ever occurred in any theatre, and well worthy of being read by every admirer of theatrical hiſtory. It would be impertinent to introduce it here, as it muſt be well known, or ſhould be, to all theatrical perſons. Thoſe who have not been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that period of the early part of the eſtabliſhed Iriſh ſtage, will find it all fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in a modern volume lately printed, by Mr. Hitchcock; a gentleman of great ability and integrity of the Dublin theatre:—It gives a general view of the Iriſh theatre, from its commencement, down to the year 1757, and will well repay the trouble of a little attention. I can anſwer, as for myſelf, that I often take Mr. Hitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock's book up for information.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan this year came over, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by Mr. Rich in the autumn 1754. The ſeaſon opened with ſome of Mr. Rich's ſtock co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, very ill acted indeed, and as dingily dreſſed.</p>
               <p>October 11, 1754, Mrs. Green made her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance from Dublin, in the character of Lappet; a good comic actreſs—much the beſt in chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, Mrs. Heidelbergs, &amp;c. ſince the time of Mrs. Clive.</p>
               <p>On Friday, October 18, 1754, Othello was announced, with an occaſional prologue, ſpoke by Mrs. Hamilton, for the introducing Mr. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0593400204:202"/>
(A gentleman well known and admired for his talents as an author, and many very reſpectable qualities; and often mentioned in the courſe of my Memoirs.) He was to appear in the difficult and dangerous part of Othello; rendered at that time more hazardous than the preſent, by the well known excellence of Mr. Barry in that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Mr. Murphy had many other reaſons to be alarmed; as he had long waged his pen of war as author of the Gray's-Inn Journal, and had been the terror of poets, and the ſcourge of players.</p>
               <p>The novelty held out was a charm irreſiſtible to attend Covent-Garden theatre.—Mr. Murphy's judgment, then or now, would be abſurd to call in queſtion; and I hold that gentleman in true regard; but on the ſtage, he certainly wanted, what we behind the ſcenes call powers, &amp;c. <hi>for great effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that gentleman's novelty of three nights, on Tueſday, October the twenty-firſt, the Nonjuror was advertiſed.—Doctor Wolf, Mr. Cibber (his firſt appearance for four years); and Maria, Mrs. Woffington (her firſt appearance for three years); which drew a great houſe.—So favourite an actreſs, and ſo well acquainted with perſons in higher life, will eaſily gain credit to my account. She was of courſe greatly received, and played that character as well as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On Wedneſday the 23d of October, Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridan made his firſt appearance in his eſteemed character of Hamlet: Judicious without doubt; but when compared to the combined excellencies of a Garrick, and the pleaſing powers of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Barry, he was not by any means eſtabliſhed from that night's performance as a darling of the London audience—Tho' in Dublin not any one performer whatever, even the Garrick, at that time would not have been univerſally crowned with lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, as to preference, or perhaps equality; but (as Mr. Macklin has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He next appeared in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, without any remarkable applauſe till the dying ſcene, where he was equal to any actor, if not ſuperior to any I had then, or have ſince ſeen, without the aid of a flounder-like flouncing, as the modern Richard's practice, to the great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, approbation, and univerſal plaudits from the <hi>galleries.</hi> Till I broke my leg I was much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to that tumb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

plays, and invariable with new ones, not to have any entertainment for the firſt nine or twelve nights—it would have been judged diſgraceful: nor did any play whatever intervene, unleſs from illneſs or an unforeſeen cauſe. Phaedra had not any ſucceſs that year. Indeed, though the poetry is elegant, it is too learned and too languid. The performers and audience ſeemed half aſleep, and the candles burned dim, unleſs at the following paſſage; which, with the advantage of Mrs. Wof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fington's figure and new dreſs, prepared them for the chace—<q>

               <p>Mr. Moncrife's Appius was acted that ſeaſon, on the ſame ſtory of Virginia, produced the year before by the Rev. Mr. Crofts at Drury-Lane, but deſtitute of every comparative merit, either as to plot, incident, writing, or any other claim to preference, and as to acting lamentably deficient.

                     <l>O! by the gods! I hunger for revenge,</l>
                     <l>I thirſt, I thirſt for blood—for blood of Appius.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Coriolanus was revived with great pomp:—Mr. Sheridan conveyed a maſterly knowledge of the character and his immortal author, old Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare. That play drew ſeveral houſes; but his OEdipus, Romeo, Zanga, Lord Townly, Sir Charles Eaſy, Oſmyn, &amp;c. did not bear equal credit. Italian burlettas were attempted by a new ſet of Italians, but met with very little attraction or applauſe:—The firſt was L'Arcadia in Brenta, on Monday the 18th of November 1754; the ſecond, entitled, La Famiglia de Bertoldi. Mr. Murphy performed Jaffier only between his firſt appearance and the benefits in March, when he acted Archer, Young Bevil, Hamlet, Macbeth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke made his firſt appearance that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Oſman in Zara, on Thurſday the 30th of October; an actor that muſt be at this time well remembered by his brethren and the public, tho' his talents were not ſtrong enough to let him live long after death.</p>
               <p>A Mrs. Glen alſo made her appearance that year in Rutland, Monday, February 24, 1756.<note n="*" place="bottom">I am right as to the dates of the month, &amp;c. but Mr. Clarke and Mrs. Glen's appearances were in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1755; Mrs. Glen's in February, 1756.</note>—

               <p>Mr. Rich revived Orpheus and Eurydice, that ſeaſon, Wedneſday, January 29, which drew crowds, but not equal to the Sorcerer, nor held in great eſtimation. That pantomime has been tried twice or thrice ſince then, but without ſucceſs.</p>

               <p>DRURY-LANE, 1755-6.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moſſop was this year enticed (partly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an affront mentioned in my Memoirs) over to Dublin, by Mr. Victor and Mr. Sowden, to play on ſhares and two benefits; where he only
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0593400204:207"/>
acted twenty-four nights, finding he could obtain more profit for himſelf by acting twenty than forty nights for his employers:—So in fact Mr. Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop's great drawings <hi>in,</hi> was on the other nights the inevitable occaſion of great drawings <hi>out</hi> from the treaſury of that theatre. Mr. Garrick, from the unexpected loſs of Moſſop, engaged Mr. Murphy to ſupply that bulwark the other's abſence had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned to give way. Mr. Murphy's firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance was on Tueſday the 30th of September, 1756, in Oſmyn in the Mourning Bride. Mr. Holland ſtarted forth in the month of October, (Monday the 13th, 1755) in the character of Oroonoko, ſupported by Mrs. Cibber in Imoinda. He was a ſhining ornament, and an honeſt, truly agreeable man, was univerſally beloved, but death ſnatched him in the bloom of life and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deprived the ſtage of an actor of merit and a worthy character.—He was too apt to <hi>out-herod</hi> Herod—by which falſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (miſtaking it for genuine fire) the big man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voice became too often harſh and unpleaſing. In conſequence, when Powell came in view, (tho' a ſuckling) he ſoon threw Holland at a diſtance, by keeping within the bounds of Nature and <hi>true ſpirit.</hi> This ſacrifice of ſenſe and ſound (which I glaringly gave way to for the ſake of catching momentary applauſe) would be leſs practiſed than
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0593400204:208"/>
it is, would we once conſider, that the opinions of the principal leaders of faſhion in every place will influence the million in a great meaſure, and by them will be allowed, followed, and adopted. The following lines on this ſubject were wrote on Holland:—<q>

               <p>Athelſtan was produced that year, written by Doctor Brown. Mr. Garrick did his very beſt to ſupport it, and the play certainly had merit,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0593400204:209"/>
and was well acted; but it never recovered the chilneſs of the ſpring, nor has ever taken root, budded or flowered, from that time to this.</p>
               <p>The Winter's Tale, introduced with an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent prologue by Mr. Garrick, had a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable run. Mrs. Cibber's neat ſimplicity in ſinging the ſong wrote by Mr. Garrick—

                  </q>
made little Perditta appear of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.—It was well caſt, and the performance juſtified Mr. Garrick's judgment in ſo ordering the characters. Catherine and Petrucio was altered into three acts on the ſame occaſion: Petrucio, Mr. Woodward; Catherine, Mrs. Clive.—He threw her down on the exit of the ſecond act, which had very near convinced the audience that Petrucio was not ſo lordly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Apprentice was introduced that year, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, 2d by Mr. Murphy; who ſpoke a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to that farce, which was afterwards inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0593400204:210"/>
and conſtantly repeated by Mr. Woodward in the character of Dick, in which part he was excellent. The farce had a great run, and ſtill continues in full effect, and ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Tempeſt as an opera in three acts, with recitative, &amp;c. was introduced that ſeaſon, with a paltry dialogue, as may be ſeen in the magazine, of Feb. 1756: Signora Curioni, an Italian ſinger, performed in it, but it was dreadfully heavy.—It went through with great labour eight nights, but not without the aid of the garland dance, well performed by ſixty children, at the end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond act, and the pantomine of Fortunatus, or the Genii, after that.</p>
               <p>All's Well that Ends Well was revived—I imagine to pleaſe Woodward, who was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Fair Quaker was alſo revived that winter, and was well acted, but the comedy of itſelf has not much ſterling merit, and its humour and the characters are too coarſe for the nice diſcrimination of the preſent age. However, Mr. Garrick made the play ſtand its ground from the good acting of Woodward, and Mr. Yates in Beau Mizen and Flip, and the parts in general not a little reinforced by the good and popular pieces the manager added as a ſupport, and the new ſong of <q rend="inline">"Hearts of oak are our ſhips,"</q> by Mr. Beard.</p>

Some nights after Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick advertiſed his performance in Archer, when, on his entrance, ſomething murmured like—Pardon! pardon! on which he advanced with great reſpect, and as great firmneſs, explained how ill he had been treated by the wanton and malignant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of wicked individuals, both in his property, fame, and character.—He acknowledged all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours received, but unleſs he was that night per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to perform his duty to the beſt of his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, he was above want, ſuperior to inſult, and would never, <hi>never</hi> appear on the ſtage again.—While he was ſpeaking all tumult ceaſed:—It was indeed a calm after a ſtorm:—They ſeemed ſo ſtruck with the truth which he aſſerted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to them, the propriety of his conduct, and the injury from illiberality and wicked wantonneſs he had actually ſuſtained, that from the idea of cenſuring Mr. Garrick unmeritedly, they felt the reproach deſervedly on themſelves, and, like true-hearted Britons, burſt into ſuch an univerſal accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

COVENT-GARDEN, 1755-6.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan's ſucceſs at Covent-Garden the preceding winter, (where he had not taken any benefit-night) did not occaſion inducement from Mr. Rich to propoſe, or Mr. Sheridan to offer, his ſervices.—Mr. Barry returned from Ireland, after the harveſt of a well-fought field—and in his hand, Miſs Noſſiter. Mrs. Bellamy, then in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation as an actreſs, continued ſtill with Mr. Rich—alſo Mrs. Woffington.—She and Bellamy were imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>acable enemies.—Negotiations were off and on between Barry and Rich, till Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, before any thing definitive occurred; and Mr. Rich, as uſual, went dreaming on with Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone, Way of the World, Country Laſſes, &amp;c. while Drury-Lane ſeemed as ſecure as if only one theatre was permitted in the capital of London.—However, on Wedneſday, November the twelfth, Mr. Barry acted Hamlet, to a numerous audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and was deſervedly received with rapture.—But the loſs ſuſtained by Mrs. Vincent being the Ophelia, (a uſeful, but an affected actreſs) in lieu of Mrs. Cibber, made a woeful comparative play to that of Mr. Garrick's at Drury-Lane, with Oſtrick, Mr. Woodward, and Ophelia and the Queen, by Mrs. Cibber and Mrs. Pritchard. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0593400204:216"/>
the only perſon of ſterling abilities, I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, in that highly finiſhed character of Ophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha, ſince Mrs. Cibber, is Mrs. S. Kemble. That lady has infinite merit in a variety of playing; but where the artleſs, the feeling, and the impreſſive, to reach the ſoul is requiſite, ſhe, need not in ſuch departments fear the moſt Critical Review; for her natural repreſentations muſt live on ſtage record, and may fearleſs bid defiance to ſatire or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Mr. Barry, on the Friday following his Hamlet, acted Jaffier; and ſtrange to relate, with ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and ſo deſerved a favourite, and in a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter where he was ſo truly excellent, there actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally were only twenty perſons in the upper gallery; a bad pit, (and I may ſuppoſe many orders) and only two ladies in the ſide-boxes on one hand, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Miſs Noſſiter did not make her appearance till

late in the ſeaſon; on Friday, December the twelfth, in the character of Monimia, which ſhe performed to a crowded audience. Barry acted Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talio, ſo excellently, that he was the only one I wiſh to remember.—Some aſpiring youth will ſmilingly obſerve, that when folks grow ancient they pronounce excellencies, and paint beauties of their <hi>old</hi> favorites which never exiſted, becauſe thoſe of the preſent day cannot contradict them; but I have proved myſelf far from being inſenſible of the high merits of the preſent race of performers, in many inſtances; and wiſh not, becauſe I praiſe <hi>Barry's Caſtalio,</hi> to ſee him, were he now living, in the <hi>Count of Narbonne;</hi> as Mr. Kemble there is himſelf <hi>alone,</hi> and ſhews <q rend="inline margQuotes">"like a great ſea-mark, ſtanding every flaw, and pleaſing thoſe that eye him."</q>
               </p>

Mr. Foote ſhared the nights of his farce as Author and Actor. He performed Sir Charles Buck, and acted Sir Paul Pliant, in the Double Dealer, and other characters to help his farce.—His benefit, as the author of the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Returned, was on the 8th of March Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let was the play—Hamlet, Mr. Barry;—Queen, Mrs. Woffington;—Polonius, Mr. Foote;—and was by every one thought a man of talents, but a very bad ſtateſman. He was ſo convinced of his error, that the day before his benefit he reſigned his place at court; and Mr. Arthur was his ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for Lord Chamberlain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry's benefit that year was on Monday, March the 22;—Buſiris; with the Knights:—Hartop, Mr. Foote.—Mrs. Woffington's was Ulyſſes; and the Frenchified Lady.

therefore poſſeſſed a double claim to applauſe and encouragement. He had ſupported moſt of Mr. Barry's characters the winter preceding; and his long continued good reception and deſervings are ſo well known, that my panegyric would be futile and impertinent.</p>

               <p>Barry at Covent-Garden, was ſinking for want of variety of characters; he playing only in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy: (Young Bevil, and Lord Townly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.)

               <p>I HAVE been reflecting this <hi>half hour</hi> (and let me tell you that half an hour is a great while for a woman to reflect) on the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>ſelf-love:</hi>—The eloquence of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes, the orations of Cicero, would never have been known, had they not been actuated by this <hi>all-ruling principle.</hi> When the uncle of the younger Pliny faſtened his pillows to his head and aſcended the burning mountain, did he riſque his life for <hi>curioſity</hi> alone?—No—the <hi>univerſal paſſion</hi> cauſed his death: And what is love of <hi>fame</hi> but <hi>ſelf-love?</hi> When the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent man reſcues merit from obſcurity, or old age from the ſtings of poverty, what is his motive?

When pretty Miſs confines the goldfinch, in an embelliſhed cage, and feeds it with her own dainty hand, is it her love for the <hi>bird</hi> that prevails upon her to give herſelf this trouble?

               <p>I think Shafteſbury, in his <hi>Moral Inquiry into Virtue,</hi> has almoſt proved that there is no virtue at all; that there is very little independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of <hi>ſelf-gratification</hi>—And does not that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy its eſſence?

couſin of mine, who keeps a ſhop about ten miles from London; where he ſells every thing, has ſaved a good purſe, bought land, and built houſes. What could the odd ſoul mean by ſuch a propoſal! Perhaps he thought it would be doing his <hi>noble</hi> family an acceptable ſervice if he tranſplanted one of its branches from the ſtage to the counter! But it will not do: I had rather be a primroſe in the wilderneſs, than a polyanthus in a hot-bed. A counter is by no means my natural ſoil; though to be ſure I might find ſome pretty amuſements in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and almoſt as many employments as Scrub had: I might ſcold the maids, dun the tenants, and ſerve in the ſhop.

The honeſt man does not know what a favour I have done him in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him. I ſuppoſe I ſhall have a few remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances from ſome of my wiſe uncles and aunts, (for I can gueſs who put ſuch a project into the man's head, I am ſure it was not his own, for in the firſt place I know his ideas could never reach from Surry to Edinburgh, though all the couſins upon earth lived there; and beſides this, he repeatedly aſſures me, <hi>that no mortal ſoul knows of his writing)</hi>; but they may ſay what they pleaſe, let me alone to anſwer them. Now you are grumbling at me for plaguing you with ſuch nonſenſe; but what can I do? You will not give me a ſubject, and therefore you muſt be contented with ſuch as I can find.—O! by the way—what took you to York?—You are horridly provoking, Mr. Wilkinſon! but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may find a way to be even with you.—Yet, hang it, men have not half the curioſity that women have; at leaſt they ſay ſo.

Let the tranſaction proceed upon that ground, and I think it will be for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>all parties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reſove, if nothing unforeſeen prevents, to turn my back upon Edinburgh on Thurſday the 11th at noon, ſo as to be able to ſleep on the ſouthern ſide of the Tweed; then I fancy I may be able to come into York to a late din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner on Saturday 13; and, that I may not be <hi>ſmoaked</hi> by any of the theatrical gentry, my firſt dinner there ſhall be at an inn.</p>
               <p>You know my <hi>forcible</hi> characters as well as I do;—you know the taſte of the public where you preſide, and therefore make choice of plays and characters that ſeem moſt advantageous in your own judgment.

I can therefore tell you, the firſt act being remarkably long, great part of it is carried into the ſecond:—and the ſending Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to England, and the grave-digging ſcene, is by that means cut out; and the introducing the ſcene that has been long omitted, where Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let intercepts the officer at the head of a party going to engage the enemy for a bit of land.—<hi>That</hi> ſcene reſtored, and the diviſion of the firſt act, makes ample amends for what is cut out.</p>
               <p>No doubt Hamlet's conſenting to go to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and being prevented and brought back by a miracle, is altogether abſurd, when his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn engagement with his father's ghoſt is duly conſidered. However, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the million will like, nay, underſtand, Shakſpeare with all his glorious abſurdities, nor ſuffer a bold invader to cut them up.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be very glad to ſee you when you come next to London, and at all times to do you any ſervice in the power of, Sir,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IT is now a conſiderable time ſince I wrote to my good friend Sir John O'Carroll, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of all the misfortunes that have happened to my family, and requeſted that he would be ſo good to let you know of them. As I have received no anſwer, I am really very uneaſy, particularly as I mentioned ſomething that nearly concerned his intereſt: I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requeſt that you will inquire about it, and inform me.</p>
               <p>I was in France near a year with my wife and Mrs. Forbes, whom I left at Montauban, and got home in June 1775. My poor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew Jack had been a long time ill, and was then at Mallow Waters. Alderman Forbes went to viſit his wife in October laſt, but the ſhip was daſhed to pieces in Wales, and he and many others were loſt. In March laſt my dear Jack exchanged this life for a better, and was ſoon followed by his broken-hearted mother, and your good friend my poor brother Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. You may eaſily conceive the diſtraction of our family. My brother John has been much affected, and my niece Hannah is, I fear; in a dangerous ſituation from the immenſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue ſhe had with her brother and mother.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0593400204:260"/>
My dear ſiſter Forbes, could not ſupport her loſs, and laſt June ſhe followed her huſband. This is too melancholy a ſubject to dwell on. I know you feel for us all. Mrs. Chaigneau and Mrs. Acheſon, (who lives with me) and all the remainder of your old friends, deſire to be remembered to you in the kindeſt manner, and believe me,</p>

               <p>I have had a miſerable cold, or I ſhould have wrote to you <hi>before;</hi> do not grumble at this, for I am ſo horridly out of ſpirits, you may thank me for writing to you <hi>now.</hi>—Beatt has taken himſelf to his brother's in Fifeſhire, and lives ſecured from duns, upon the fat of a lean land.

                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I ſhould be happy if I could give you the leaſt aſſiſtance relative to the matter you have wrote to me about. I can only ſpeak from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and my then knowledge of the army.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0593400204:269"/>
I was at that time at Portſmouth. Sir Robert Rich's regiment of dragoons, to which I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, was all 1758 in Scotland, except the light troop, which marched into England on Thurot with his fleet appearing off our northern coaſt, and I marched with it, as Lieutenant, in Septem. 1758. I knew Capt. Anthony St. Leger, in the 3d, or King's own regiment of dragoons, who was then at Portſmouth with the light troop of that regiment. I am confident there then was not a colonel or lieutenant colonel Thornton belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the horſe at Portſmouth, or in the Engliſh ſervice at that time. If I recollect right there was only one field officer appointed to command the light troops upon the expedition that went out that ſummer againſt Cherbourg, which was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor George Warde, of the 11th dragoons, now Lieutenant General Warde. In 1758 every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of heavy dragoons had a light troop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, which were detached corps in order to be ſent upon thoſe expeditions; ſo that each troop had only a captain, lieutenant, and cornet ſent with it.</p>
                  <p>You are miſtaken with regard to the rank of the gentleman you mention. There was at that time a <hi>Lieut. William Thornton</hi> of the 7th dragoons, who was there, and went upon the expedition; he was a man univerſally known and beloved by
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0593400204:270"/>
every body who knew him: He had lived much in the world, was very much of a gentleman, and very ſenſible, but was rather partial to his bottle.—I wiſh to be as particular as poſſible, as I think he was the perſon you mean. He was about thirty years of age, about five feet eight inches high, handſome face, and well made.—There was a circumſtance happened upon that expedition. Captain Lindſay of the 11th dragoons was killed; and General Bligh, who commanded upon the expedition, and had power given him by his Majeſty to fill all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies that ſhould happen in the army, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Lieutenant William Thornton</hi> to a troop in the 10th dragoons, which he commanded till they returned to Portſmouth, where Lord New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle, now Marquis of Lothian, came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the troop, being appointed to it by his Majeſty; the 10th dragoons being then his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, Lord Ancram's, regiment.—The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance was much talked of in the army, as Thornton would not return to his former regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or rank.—The latter end of that year we had in our regiment a captain who died, and Thornton was appointed captain in his room. Thornton died in London in 1765. I remember Captain St. Leger, (afterwards Major General St. Leger), was very intimate with Thornton.—
