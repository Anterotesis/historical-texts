            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the <hi>Hoſpital</hi> or <hi>Jail Fever</hi> is already well known, and has been correctly and minutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by ſeveral writers upon the ſubject; I ſhould not have thought myſelf authorized to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude this account upon the public attention, had not the treatment of the diſeaſe, which was adopted and ſucceſsfully purſued at Carliſle, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to differ in ſome circumſtances from what has hitherto obtained in general practice. This difference conſiſts principally in the more <hi>early</hi> application, and in the much <hi>freer</hi> uſe of <hi>Bark</hi> and <hi>Port Wine.</hi> A caution ſeems to have been ſcrupulouſly adhered to, of not adminiſtering theſe remedies until the laſt ſtage of the diſeaſe; by which delay the ſtrength of the patient has often been ſo totally reduced, that all applications of the moſt tonic, ſtimulating, and corroborating medicines have ſailed of effect. With reſpect to the <hi>quantity</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> whereas Sir John Pringle never directed more than a bottle in the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0006801600:3"/>day, and rarely ſo much, we have here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from one bottle to two bottles and an half daily, always with advantage, and without any obſervable inconveniency from exceſs. The doſes alſo of the <hi>Bark</hi> are nearly double to thoſe which the ſame eminent Phyſician uſually exhibited.</p>
            <p>If the medical reader be taught by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to ſuſpect the reſerve with which he has proceeded in the uſe of <hi>Bark</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to be unneceſſary and hurtful—if further enquiry and experience encourage him in a more liberal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe valuable <hi>tonics</hi> and <hi>ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants</hi>—and if the lives of any of our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be thereby preſerved, the publication of theſe papers will have fulfilled every intention of their author.</p>

               <p>ABOUT the beginning of <hi>April</hi> an epidemic Fever began to make its appearance in <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and continued to rage with more or leſs violence during the remaining part of the year.</p>
               <p>The riſe, progreſs, and decline of this epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic will be beſt aſcertained by examining the regiſter of deaths, where I find that <hi>two</hi> fell victims to it, in the month of <hi>May; four</hi> in <hi>June; four</hi> in <hi>July; eight</hi> in <hi>Auguſt; ſeven</hi> in <hi>September; nine</hi> in <hi>October; eight</hi> in

Since that time there has been ſome increaſe, which however is not aſcertained, but which cannot be very conſiderable.</note> a circumſtance, the cauſe of which, I perhaps may at ſome future opportunity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inveſtigate, at preſent I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent myſelf with barely mentioning the fact.</p>

               <p>During the winter, we had no froſt of any long duration, but the cold was, conſidering the climate, ſometimes very intenſe. The ſpring, upon the whole, was mild and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. In May, June, and July, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was remarkably warm, dry, and ſerene; and continued ſo till about the middle of Auguſt, when the temperature of the air ſuddenly changed, and we had ten days or a fortnight of cold wet weather. In Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the air was warm and moiſt; in October, it was remarkably temperate and dry. November commenced with a ſmart froſtt, which however, continued but two days; the reſt; of the month (the 22d and 23d days excepted which were froſt) was conſtantly wet, blowing weather. Till the 13th of december, the air was remarkably dry, even to ſuch a degree as to make the roads du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0006801600:8"/>in full blow. On the 28th there was a moſt violent ſtorm of wind and rain from the weſt, which continued for ſeveral hours.</p>
               <p>This Fever chiefly, I may almoſt ſay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, raged amongſt the common and lower ranks of people; and more eſpecially amongſt thoſe who lived in narrow, cloſe, confined lanes, and in ſmall crowded apartments.</p>

               <p>I have endeavoured to aſcertain the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons who have been ſeized with this Fever, and, from the beſt information I have been able to procure, it appears that near ſix hundred have, at this time viz.

               <p>In this ſituation the patient for the moſt part, continues one, two, or ſometimes even three days, not altogether confined to his bed, but if left to himſelf getting up and lying down upon the bed ſeveral times in a day.</p>
               <p>This I ſhall denominate the firſt ſtage of the diſorder.</p>
               <p>According to the moderation or violence of the above ſymptoms, the patient is confined entirely to his bed, on the ſecond, third, or ſometimes on the beginning of the fourth day from the firſt acceſſion of the cold ſhivering fit. Almoſt all the ſymptoms now increaſe. The pain of the head becomes acute; the debility is ſuch, that the patient cannot be raiſed to an erect, or even ſitting poſture for any length of time, without great danger of bringing on a fainting fit; the appetite is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally gone; the thirſt increaſes; a tremor of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0006801600:13"/>the hands ſupervenes; the tongue becomes gradually dry, and brown, and when thruſt out of the mouth for examination is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady and tremulous; the ſkincontinues dry; the urine pale and without ſediment; the pulſe becomes more frequent and feeble, viz. from a hundred and ten, to a hundred and fifteen, or even a hundred and twenty ſtrokes in a minute.</p>
               <p>The patient talks ſome what incoherently, yet knows his friends, and will anſwer queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with tolerable diſtinctneſs. In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he continues ſix, ſeven, eight, nine, ten, or eleven days, and from which, if the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms do not increaſe, he gradually recovers. The acute pain of the head abates; the thirſt is more moderate; the urine becomes higher coloured and depoſits ſome little ſediment, the colour and conſiſtence of which is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever various; the pulſe gets down gradually to a hundred, ninety, eighty, &amp;c. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0006801600:14"/>at the ſame time a little fuller and ſtronger; the patient, tho' he has no great deſire for food, yet is able to take a little when preſented to him; and laſtly, his ſtrength is reſtored by ſlow degrees.</p>
               <p>The above is the more uſual and favourable appearance and progreſs of the diſeaſe; but often either from neglect or an improper treatment in the beginning, or the patient's bad habit of body it puts on a more fatal and alarming form.</p>
               <p>The pain of the head continues; a putrid colliquative looſeneſs comes on; the tongue as well as baſe of the teeth are covered with a thick black cruſt, and the patient is unable to thruſt it out of his mouth, and loſes the power of ſpeech and of ſwallowing.</p>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>petechiae</hi> appear on different parts of the body, and in ſome caſes the whole
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0006801600:15"/>ſurface of the body is covered with a ſcarlet offloreſcence, which however, ſoon diſappears. The pulſe becomes weaker and quicker, from one hundred and thirty to one hundred and fifty ſtrokes in a minute; the patient is now altogethe rinſenſible; the urine and faeces are voided without conſciouſneſs; he knows not the by-ſtanders; the delirium is however of the low, not of the furious or outrageous kind.</p>
               <p>His muſcles become flaccid; he gathers the bed clothes <hi>(collectio floccorum);</hi> he his affected with <hi>ſubfultus tendinum,</hi> convulſive ſtartings and twitchings of the muſcles of the whole body; he gradually ſlides towards the foot of the bed; his extremities become cold; a ſmall quantity of blood ſometimes diſtills from his noſtrils; his face has a livid and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daverous appearance, and death which ſoon follows theſe ſymptoms, puts a period to his ſufferings.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0006801600:16"/>
               <p>After death broad livid blotches appear about the neck and ſhoulders, and putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoon takes place.</p>
               <p>The appearance of the blood I am unable to deſcribe, never having had an opportunity of ſeeing or examining it.</p>

                  <head>Anomalous Symptoms.</head>
                  <p>A Diarrhaea ſometimes occured in the firſt ſtage of the diſorder, but whether it was a ſymptom of the general weakneſs, or was occaſioned by the bark and other remedies, is uncertain; at all events, if poſſible, it was to be checked immediately. In ſome caſes the fever was attended with a cough, ſometimes with, at other times without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration; in other caſes the pulſe was by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0006801600:17"/>no means ſo weak as is above repreſented. A difficulty of making water approaching almoſt to a ſuppreſſion of urine, with a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the abdomen and evident fluctuation, happened in one or two inſtances. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe did not occur to my obſervation, and if it ever happened, it was very ſeldom.</p>
                  <p>Being perſuaded of the general truth of the doctrine of critical days, I looked for them in the preſent caſe with ſome attention, but as far as I could obſerve, this Fever had no ſtated or certain duration; its termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whether in health or in death, by no means happened on certain fixed periods of the diſeaſe, and were ſeldom or ever attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the leaſt appearance of a critical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. Patients I believe died on almoſt every day of the Fever, from the fifth or ſixth, to the ſixteenth or ſeventeenth. The ſalutary terminations occurred as frequently on the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0006801600:18"/>
                     <hi>non-critical</hi> as on the <hi>critical days,</hi> a favourable change ſometimes taking place on the ſixth and ſeventh, often on the eight, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and ſixteenth days from the acceſſion of the diſeaſe, and in one caſe no viſible change for the better took place till the eighteenth day; but liere the patient had not called in advice till the Fever had made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable progreſs.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, an early or a late, a ſalutary or a fatal termination of this Fever, entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the conſtitution of the patient, and the ſpeedy application of proper remedies. If the patient had a tolerable conſtitution, and the bark and wine were given in large quantities, immediately after the acceſſion of the diſeaſe, he ſoon recovered; If on the contrary, the uſe of theſe medicines was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for any length of time, he either died, or was brought to the greateſt extremities of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0006801600:19"/>weakneſs and danger, from which he recovered exceeding flowly; but concerning theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more fully in the laſt ſection.</p>
                  <p>Having thus related the moſt diſtinguiſhing ſymptoms of this Fever, I ſhall now proceed to mention a few particulars reſpecting the prognoſtics.</p>

               <p>ON this head I ſhall content myſelf with pointing out, firſt, thoſe ſymptoms which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a favourable iſſue; and ſecondly thoſe which on the contrary portend danger and death.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when the pulſe, in the ſecond ſtage of the diſeaſe, does not exceed one hundred and twenty ſtrokes in a minute, and grows ſlower, and ſtronger by the uſe of <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>bark;</hi> when the urine by the ſame remedies
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0006801600:21"/>becomes higher coloured, and depoſits upon ſtanding a little time a ſediment; when the delirium is not conſtant, but only occurs when the patient awakens out of ſleep; when the pain of the head is not violent, or if it has been violent, upon the uſe of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies hereafter deſcribed abates; when the patient is able to lie on his back or ſides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently; when he is able to put out his tongue, to ſwallow, and to anſwer queſtions diſtinctly, we may, in general, promiſe a favourable termination.</p>
               <p>But in the ſecond place, if the pulſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a liberal and copious uſe of <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>bark</hi> is feeble, and exceeds one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty ſtrokes in a minute; if the urine continues crude and pale; if the delirium is conſtant; if the looſeneſs cannot be reſtrained by proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; if the urine and faeces are voided involuntarily; if the teeth are covered with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0006801600:22"/>a black gummy matter; if the tongue is parched, black and chopped; if the patient cannot articulate diſtinctly, or ſwallow, or put out his tongue when deſired; when he can only lie upon his back; when <hi>ſubſultus tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> tremours of the hands, and convulſive ſtartings in other parts of the body come on; when he is affected with <hi>ſtupor;</hi> when he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to gather up the bed clothes; when his extremities become cold, his face livid, and covered with a cold clammy ſweat, and he ſlides down the bed, death is at no great diſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petechiae</hi> which have by Phyſicians been juſtly deemed marks of malignity and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in fevers of this kind, did not, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my obſervation, portend imminent danger; nor did a bleeding of the noſe, unleſs occuring together with other dangerous circumſtances, appear to me to be an alarming
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0006801600:23"/>ſymptom; for ſeveral patients affected with one or the other of theſe ſymptoms, if a ſufficient quantity of proper <hi>tonic</hi> and <hi>ſtimulant</hi> remedies were thrown in, recovered, and got thro' the diſtemper as well as others who were not affected with them.

                  <hi>SECTION III.</hi> Of the Remote <hi>CAUSES</hi> of this <hi>FEVER,</hi> and particularly of the Occaſional <hi>CAUSE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Peculiar conſtitution, or temperament of the air has been often accuſed, and perhaps in ſome caſes with propriety, as laying the foundation of many epidemical diſorders; accordingly I thought it not improper to mention the ſtate of the weather, not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the appearance, but during the riſe, progreſs and decline of this Fever, altho' I am inclined to think, in the preſent inſtance, it was by no means a powerful agent.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0006801600:25"/>
               <p>Becauſe, in the firſt place, this epidemic was in a great meaſure confined to the city and ſuburbs of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> whereas the general ſtate of the air muſt be ſuppoſed to be nearly the ſame through the whole neighbourhood, and more eſpecially in the adjacent villages, where, however, no diſeaſe of the kind ever appeared, unleſs the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of it had been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently carried, either by ſome perſons who had laboured under the diſeaſe, or whoſe clothes, &amp;c. had been previouſly <hi>imbued</hi> with the contagion.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place becauſe the temperature of the air in the months of October and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, (when the Fever raged with the greateſt violence) was different from what it had been in April and May, (the months in which the diſorder began to make its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) but ſimilar to what it was in December and January, when it was manifeſtly upon the decline.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0006801600:26"/>
               <p>If we therefore wiſh to diſcover the cauſes, which will be of no little importance in aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the true and preciſe nature of the diſeaſe, we muſt attend to more local, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances than the general qualities of the air.</p>
               <p>It is evident from the preceding hiſtory, that this Fever is extremely contagious, i. e. it is evident that a ſubtile, active and virulent ſubſtance is generated in, and eſcapes from the body of a perſon labouring under the diſeaſe, which, when applied to a ſound body, in particular circumſtances, will produce a ſimilar affection; and thus it is propagated from one part of a family to another; and from neigbour to neigbour. This active poiſon is by phyſicians denominated <hi>Contagion,</hi> or more properly <hi>Human Effluvia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How this poiſon operates on our ſyſtems is not thoroughly underſtood, but under what circumſtances it is firſt generated and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0006801600:27"/>we are often, but too well acquainted. It is the offspring of filth, naſtineſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined air, in rooms crowded with many inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. Hence ſuch <hi>Effluvia</hi> often originates in ſhips, hoſpitals, and jails, of which many ſtriking examples are upon record.</p>
               <p>At the aſſizes held at Oxford in the year 1577, a putrid effluvia ariſing from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners at the bar infected a great part of the court with a peſtilential ſever, of which upwards of three hundred perſons died.<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden. Annal. Reg. Elizab. Bacon. Mead.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Another very melancholy inſtance of the fatal effects of <hi>human effluvia</hi> occurred in the year 1750, during the ſeſſions at the Old Baily. At theſe ſeſſions near one hundred priſoners were tried, who were all during the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0006801600:28"/>ſitting of the court, either placed at the bar, or confined in two ſmall rooms which opened into the court. The court houſe was crowded with people, great numbers of whom were almoſt inſtantly ſeized with the Jail Fever, and above forty died of it; but the muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable circumſtance is, that thoſe only were affected who were on the left-hand ſide of the Lord Mayor, a ſtream of air from the priſoners being directed to that ſide of the room, in conſequence of a window being opened on the other. All on the right-hand ſide eſcaped, the <hi>putrid effluvia</hi> being wafted from them to the oppoſite ſide.</p>
               <p>In both theſe inſtances, it does not appear that the priſoners, either before or after their trials, were affected with any particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, reſembling that which ſeized ſo many, and of which they were ſuppoſed to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0006801600:29"/>the contagion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Juſt before this ſheet was going to be printed off, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oſter's reports accidentally fell into my hands, in which, I find the following obſervations.
<q>
                        <p>"It ought to be remembered that at the time this diſaſter happened, there was no ſickneſs in the Gaol more than is common in ſuch places: this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which diſtinguiſheth this from moſt of the caſes of the like kind which we have heard of, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth a very proper caution, <hi>not to preſume too far upon the health of the Gaol, barely becauſe the Gaol-Fever is not among the priſoners.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For without doubt, if the points of cleanlineſs and free air have been greatly neglected, the putrid <hi>effluvia</hi> which the priſoners bring with them in their clothes, &amp;c. eſpecially where too many are brought into a crowded court together, may have fatal effects on people who are accuſtomed to breathe better air; though the poor wretches, who are in ſome meaſuve habituated to the fumes of a priſon, may not always be ſenſible of any great inconvenience from them.</p>
                        <p>The perſons of chief note who were in court at this time and died of this Fever were, Sir <hi>Samuel Pennant</hi> Lord Mayor for that year, Sir <hi>Thomas Abney</hi> one of the Juſtices of the common pleas, <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Clarke,</hi>Eſq; one of the barons of the exchequer, and Sir <hi>Daniel Lambert,</hi> one of the aldermen of London. Of leſs note a gentleman of the bar, two ſtudents, one of the under ſheriffs, an officer of Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Lee,</hi> who attended his Lordſhip in the Court at that time, ſeveral of the Jury on the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex ſide, and about forty other perſons whom buſineſs or curioſity had brought thither."</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Foſter's Reports, p. 74.</p>
                     <p>In order to prevent ſuch melancholy accidents hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in Courts of Juſtice, it perhaps might not be improper to <hi>bathe</hi> the priſoners, and accommodate them with <hi>clean clothes,</hi> or at leaſt with <hi>clean linen</hi> immediately before they are brought to the bar. Such regulations I apprehend would not be attended either with much trouble or expence, and might be the means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the lives of many individuals, who may be ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on theſe ſolemn occaſions, their king, and their country.</p>
                  </note> How then, it may be aſked, could the diſeaſe be caught in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of any <hi>effluvia</hi> ariſing from their bodies? If any <hi>putrid effluvia</hi> had been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated amongſt them during their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0006801600:30"/>would not they have ſuffered from it ſooner than others to whom it was afterwards applied; in conſequence of diffuſion in the air, and more eſpecially as it is to be imagined that the bodies of the priſoners were diſpoſed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0006801600:31"/>to receive infection, from their being fed on a poor watery diet, and from that anxiety which they muſt ſuffer from their ſituations?</p>
               <p>In anſwer to theſe queſtions let it be in the firſt place, obſerved, that many of theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners had been long confined; many had
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0006801600:32"/>been long accuſtomed to filth and uncleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in conſequence of which the <hi>putrid effluvia</hi> would be generated gradually, and for along time be conſtantly applied to their bodies in ſmall quantities, till it, at length, became as it were, their natural atmoſphere, when they would no more feel its influence, than the <hi>Tanner</hi> perceives the ſmell of his tanyard, or the <hi>Chandler</hi> the ſmell of his putrid tallow.</p>
               <p>Further, the human body is poſſeſſed of the power either of accommodating itſelf to, or reſiſting the effects of many active and noxious bodies, when they are conſtantly and gradually applied in ſmall quantities, which would injure many of the functions of life, nay even in ſome caſes bring on death, were they given in large doſes at firſt. This may be illuſtrated by the effects of <hi>opium,</hi> of <hi>hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> and of <hi>tobacco</hi> on the human body. Every one knows, that a perſon, by conſtantly accuſtoming himſelf to make uſe of theſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0006801600:33"/>drugs, in ſmall quantities, will in time acquire the habit of taking without danger a quantity at one doſe which would either injure the health, or even deſtroy the life of another perſon.</p>
               <p>It Is preſumed to be upon this principle that phyſicians and ſurgeons viſit the ſick with ſo much impunity. They are frequently expoſed to the infection, but rarely in contagious diſeaſes ſtay any conſiderable time with the patient, by which means they never imbibe a large quantity of the contagious matter at any one time, at leaſt till their conſtitutions have acquired the power of reſiſting its effects.</p>
               <p>For examples of the production and effects of <hi>human effluvia</hi> in hoſpitals, ſhips, and camps, the reader may conſult <hi>Huxham, Priagle,</hi> and <hi>Lind.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0006801600:34"/>
               <p>But jails, hoſpitals, ſhips, &amp;c. are not the only places in which this poiſon may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; it may be generated in any cloſe room or apartment where a great number of inhabitants are crowded together, and where little attention is paid to cleanlineſs. In the inſtance of this diſeaſe which prevailed at Carliſle, altho' we perhaps may not be able to point out the particular houſe in which the cauſe of the Fever orginated, yet I think we may without much heſitation pronounce that the occaſional cauſe of it is <hi>human effluvia,</hi> which has been generated in ſome little dirty confined place, of which there are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in Carliſle, and every other large manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing town. When I ſurveyed this town and ſuburbs, I had an opportunity of ſeeing many ſcenes of poverty, of filth and naſtineſs; and in the bills of mortality for the year 1779 the following obſervation is made.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>"Nervous and putrid ſevers are not very
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0006801600:35"/>frequent; no more than five have ſuffered by both theſe diſeaſes, which muſt appear ſomewhat aſtoniſhing to one who knows how many inhabitants there are of the loweſt rank, who are crowded in cloſe and ſmall apartments where they ſleep, eat and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their victuals; whoſe food cannot be the moſt nutritive; who ſeldom change their clothes; and who pay but little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cleanlineſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it appears probable that <hi>human effluvia</hi> was the occaſional cauſe of this Fever. We have only to obſerve that it never ſeemed to produce fever, except in caſes either where it was applied as it immediately iſſued from its ſources, and eſpecially where it was accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from want of ventilation, or where it was communicated by means of clothes, &amp;c. that had been uſed by the perſon labouring under the fever, in which it may be long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0006801600:36"/>Nor was it in general ſo virulent and active as to produce any noxious effects, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in concurrence with ſome other remote cauſes, concerning which we ſhall now ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Since I had arranged the above particulars from my notes, I have upon enquiry, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the preciſe place where this Fever began; about the latter end of March or the beginning of April. It was in a houſe in Richard-Gate, which contains about half a dozen very poor families; the rooms are exceeding ſmall, and in order to diminiſh the window tax, every window that even poverty could diſpenſe with was ſhut up, hence ſtagnation of air, which was rendered ſtill more noxious by the filth and uncleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people. The ſurgeon who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome of theſe poor wretches, told me, the ſmell was ſo offenſive and diſagreeable that it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0006801600:37"/>was with difficulty he could ſtay in the houſe, while he enquired into the ſituation of his patient.</p>
               <p>One of the perſons affected with the Fever in this houſe was a weaver, who, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, went to his uſual employment at a large workſhop, where he communicated the diſorder to his fellow weavers, and from thence the Fever ſpread all over the town.</p>

               <p>CONCERNING theſe cauſes which, as is were, prepared the body for the action of <hi>human effluvia,</hi> it is not my intention at preſent to enlarge much. Without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to explain their mode of operation, I ſhall deem it ſufficient briefly to enumerate them. They are evidently ſuch as have a tendency to weaken and debilitate the whole body; and more eſpecially the nervous and muſcular
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0006801600:39"/>fibres; and may I think be comprized under the following heads.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0006801600:40"/>or ſpirituous liquors, as the one or the other is moſt agreeable to the conſtitution, will prove the moſt effectual preſervatives.

               <p>IN ſection firſt, I have faithfully related the the phaenomena attendant on this diſeaſe; in the third and fourth I have endeavoured to aſcertain the cauſes which produced theſe phaenomena; and in this I ſhall attempt to point out the means, which, from experience, I have found to be the moſt effectual in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about an early and ſalutary termination.</p>
               <p>After having attentively conſidered the facts delivered in the preceding ſections, I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0006801600:42"/>think we cannot heſitate a moment in dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the following concluſions.</p>

                  <item>1. That the diſeaſe in a great meaſure conſiſts in extreme debility.</item>

                  <item>1. To remove the cauſes, or obviate the effects of that debility.</item>
                  <item>2. To obviate or correct the tendency of the fluids towards putrefaction.</item>
               </list>
               <p>At whatever period of the diſeaſe I am cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a patient, my firſt care is to remove, if poſſible, every cauſe of the diſeaſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to ſubſiſt. The cauſes which continue to operate, and aggravate the diſorder after it is fully formed, are in general <hi>human efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0006801600:43"/>generated in and iſſuing from the patient's own body; uncleanlineſs which favours an accumulation of theſe <hi>effluvia;</hi> grief; anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and fear.</p>
               <p>I immediately order the patient clean linen, which ought to be changed every day, or at fartheſt every other day, and if poſſible endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to direct a ſtream of freſh air over the bed, which not only carries off the noxious particles as they are formed, prevents an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of them, and keeps the chamber pure and ſweet, but univerſally acts as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſtimulus to the patient<note n="*" place="bottom">More eſpecially in the ſummer when the weather was hot: ſome caution perhaps ought to be uſed during intenſe froſt.</note>. But if the ſituation of the bed would not admit of this, either a window, or the door, or ſometimes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0006801600:44"/>both were adviſed to be kept open, and if the bed had curtains they were always or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be open. The excretions of the ſick, whether faeces or urine, &amp;c. were immediately removed.</p>
               <p>A ſtrict obſervance of theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially in the early ſtages of the Fever, tended much to mitigate its virulence; and prevented the diſorder from ſpreading. On the contrary the neglect of them was, I am ſatisfied, frequently attended with dangerous and fatal conſequences; which nobody I think will doubt, when I inform them that I have been often called to patients on the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh days of the Fever, and found them in a ſmall dirty room; the bed near a large fire, where the victuals were preparing for the reſt of the family; the bed curtains cloſe drawn; the ſheets, and ſhirt upon the patient's back, almoſt black with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0006801600:45"/>dirt, ſo that he was immerſed in a <hi>putrid efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> rendered highly poiſonous by ſtagnation, heat, and conſequent fermentation.</p>
               <p>If the patient lamented the death of ſome friend or relation, his ſorrow was attempted to be ſcothed; and if he was fearful and anxious, as was often the caſe, about his own fate, he was always encouraged with hopes of a ſpeedy recovery. Fear operates as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive debilitating power on the human body, and when it acts in conjunction with <hi>human effluvia</hi> ſeldom fails to produce fever. Every thing therefore which tends in the leaſt to excite this paſſion of the mind, eſpecially in thoſe who are already ſick, ought to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly avoided. This obſervation leads me to take notice of ſome cuſtoms very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and which in oppoſition to this ſalutary caution, tend much to alarm and terrify the <hi>ſick.</hi>

               <p>What is the conſequence? A patient is confined to his bed, his body is debilitated to the laſt degree, his ſpirits are depreſſed, he hears theſe repeated and ſucceſſive notices of death: it may be perhaps of the death of ſome friend or near relation; he is anxious and alarmed; and if ſenſible, concludes as diſponding people uſually do, that his fate will be the next; upon which he is ſeized with ſudden terror, which increaſes his weakneſs, aggravates all his complaints, and ſometimes it is to be feared renders a diſeaſe fatal, which might otherwiſe have yielded to the power of medicine.</p>

               <p>Theſe circumſtances being premiſed, I now come to take notice of thoſe remedies which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0006801600:49"/>appeared, from my own experience, to be the moſt efficacious in anſwering the above indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of cure.</p>
               <p>At the commencement of the epidemic, when I was called early in the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, which however was not often the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0006801600:50"/>caſe, I ordered the patient the <hi>ſaline mixture,</hi> and if there were evident ſymptoms of coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs, a ſmall portion of <hi>tartar emetic</hi> was added to it; a medicine which I had often uſed, and with apparent ſucceſs in ſlow nervous fevers.<note n="†" place="bottom">Typhus mitior of Noſologiſts. Cullen. Synop. Noſol. p. 72.</note> I took care however that the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the <hi>tartar emetic</hi> ſhould not be ſufficient to excite any great degree either of <hi>nauſea</hi> or vomiting, for in ſome caſes where the <hi>nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> proceeded to actual <hi>vomiting,</hi> I found all the ſymptoms were conſiderably aggravated. And as the epidemic advanced, and I had greater opportunities of aſcertaining the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſeaſe, I altogether laid it aſide as an uſeleſs or even as a noxious medicine.</p>
               <p>Along with the <hi>ſaline mixture</hi> the patient was ordered to take the <hi>bark</hi> in ſubſtance, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0006801600:51"/>to drink plentifully of port wine, ſometimes pure, ſometimes, when he complained of thirſt, diluted with a ſmall portion of cold water. If there was any tendency to ſickneſs, the <hi>ſaline draught</hi> was taken in the act of <hi>efferveſcence</hi> until the ſickneſs abated.</p>
               <p>It happened, however, more uſually that I did not ſee the patient till the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe was finiſhed; in ſuch caſes, rather than overload the patient's ſtomach with too much medicine, I altogether ommitted the <hi>ſaline mixture,</hi> and entirely confided in the uſe of <hi>bark</hi> and wine, and was ſeldom diſappointed.</p>
               <p>The tonic, cordial, ſtimulant and antiſeptic qualities of theſe remedies in a remarkable manner increaſed the vigour of the ſyſtem, and in a great meaſure preventd any tendency to putrefaction. For by a copious and liberal uſe of them, the pulſe became ſlower, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0006801600:52"/>ſtronger; the thirſt, and pain of the head abated; the delirium was removed; the urine became higher coloured, and was either cloudy, or depoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted ſome little ſediment; and laſtly the patient got ſome refreſhing ſleep. It is not, however, by adminiſtering theſe remedies in ſmall quantities, or at diſtant intervals, that we are to expect theſe ſalutary effects.</p>
               <p>The debility was in general ſo great, as to render it neceſſary to throw them in, in large quantities, otherwiſe little or no good effects were produced.</p>
               <p>The following was my general mode of giving the <hi>bark.</hi>

               <p>According to the age, ſex, conſtitution of the patient, and urgency of the ſymptoms, different quantities of wine were adminiſtered. I had no opportunity of ſeeing any very young children in the diſeaſe, and when it affected children from eight to twelve or fourteen years of age, it was in general very mild.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0006801600:54"/>
               <p>To adults I uſually ordered from one bottle to two bottles and one half, in the ſpace of twenty-four hours; and I believe more might have been taken with advantage, for I never ſaw any bad effects from an exceſs, tho' I have perceived evident ones from a too ſparing uſe of this grateful cordial. Indeed I often found it a difficult matter to perſuade the nurſes to adminiſter it in ſufficient quantities, ſome were deterred by prejudices, but more I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve were prevented by poverty. Almoſt in every caſe it was my conſtant cuſtom on leaving the patient to urge the plentiful uſe of wine. In this method I conſtantly perſevered till a change took place, which was in general favourable, when the quantity of wine was gradually diminiſhed and the patient was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſtrong freſh broth, panada &amp;c. and in a little time by ſolid animal food.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0006801600:55"/>
               <p>Soon after this Fever made its appearance I had recourſe to <hi>pediluvium,</hi> but I quickly found it was rather prejudicial than uſeful, for the debility was in many caſes ſo extreme that the patient ſometimes fainted during the operation, and was always very much fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, which more than counterbalanced the ſtimulating and antiſpaſmodic effects of the warm water.</p>
               <p>Fomentations however of the feet and legs, by means of ſeveral folds of flannel wrung out of hot water, were afterwards uſed with apparent advantage, for in this caſe the fatigue occaſioned by the operation was very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
               <p>Bliſters ſeemed to have little or no effect upon the general ſyſtem, or in raiſing the pulſe, but when applied behind the ſhoulders or to the nape of the neck, their operation
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0006801600:56"/>was obvious in abating the violent pain of the head. A young girl about nine years old was affected with the Fever, and particularly complained of a very ſevere and acute pain in her head. The ſurgeon who attended her preſcribed the <hi>ſaline mixture</hi> with <hi>tartar emetic</hi> in ſmall quantities, and took about five or ſix ounces of blood from her arm, in hopes of relieving the head ach, but without effect, for it rather increaſed after the bleeding. I was ſent for the next day, and notwithſtanding her pulſe was ſtronger than in moſt inſtances of this Fever, I adviſed a bliſter to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately applied betwixt her ſhoulders, which ſoon removed the pain in her head. She was at the ſame time ordered to take a ſtrong <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction</hi> of the <hi>bark</hi> with plenty of wine which ſoon freed her from all complaints. I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in ſimilar circumſtances, always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribbed <hi>bliſters,</hi> and generally with ſimilar ſucceſs.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0006801600:57"/>
               <p>A <hi>Diarrhea</hi> often occurred in the ſecond ſtage of the diſcaſe, ſometimes even in the firſt. Whether it was occaſioned by the <hi>bark,</hi> or was a conſequence of the previous debility is a matter of no great moment. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a diſagreeable, often a dangerous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and never to be triſled with; for when it was even moderate it never failed to weaken the patient greatly. Diſregarding therefore all ill grounded apprehendſions of blocking up the paſſages and retaining a putrid <hi>ſomes</hi> in the inteſtinal canal, I conſtantly attempted to put a ſtop to the evacution as quickly as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and where I was fortunate enough to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed my patients always recovered.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe I ordered in ſome caſes ſix or eight drops of <hi>tinct. thebaic.</hi> in every doſe of the bark. But when the <hi>diarrhaea</hi> was likely to be violent, and not to be eaſily reſtrained, the <hi>bark</hi> was diſcontinued, the quantity of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0006801600:58"/>wine was increaſed, and a cordial aſtringent compoſition ſome what like the following was made uſe of.</p>

               <p>It ſometimes happened that the patient was affected with ſymptoms of a <hi>cold</hi> or <hi>catarrh,</hi> and in ſuch caſes the pulſe was not altogether ſo ſmall and weak as I have before repreſented in the hiſtory of the Fever; and in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance I found the pulſe ſo ſtrong that I ſhould have been induced to have drawn a little blood, had I not been previouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nature of the prevailing epidemic, and the dangerous conſequences of bleeding. When the ſituation of the patient was ſuch, the only difference of my practice conſiſted in adminiſtering his wine and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines a little warm, and if the cough was very troubleſome, I omitted, tho' perhaps without any great reaſon, the uſe of the <hi>rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerpent. virgin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With reſpect to the anomalous ſymptoms, ſuch as a difficulty of making water and in conſequence of it a ſwelling of the abdomen,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0006801600:61"/>I left them entirely to nature, and when the patient recovered from the fever and was able to get out of bed, the diſcharge of urine not only became free but copious, which in a very little time diminiſhed the tumour of the belly.</p>
               <p>Through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, when fruit could be procured, the patient was deſired to eat as much of it as he pleaſed, except when contra-indicated by a diarrhaea. By ſteadily purſuing this method from the beginning, the patient was not only ſaved, but the ſymptoms were rendered more moderate, and the duration of the diſeaſe much ſhortened.</p>
               <p>Every perſon who is the leaſt acquainted with medicine, after attentively reading the hiſtory, ſymptoms, and cauſes of this Fever will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive that bleeding muſt be highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0006801600:62"/>In confirmation of which I have now only to obſerve, that towards the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the diſorder, before its nature had been clearly aſcertained, and perhaps where the pulſe was ſome what ſtronger, than in the caſes which I had an opportunity of obſerving, a few patients were let blood, ſome in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of advice, ſome of their own accord; of theſe however ſcarcely one eſcaped.<note n="*⁎*" place="bottom">The weather in the month of January 1782, except about two days of froſt, was conſtantly wet, warm and blowing; wind weſt or ſouth weſt. In this month three perſons died viz. one bachelor, one wife, and one widow, which makes the number of deaths <hi>fifty-five:</hi> and there are at this preſent time, viz.
