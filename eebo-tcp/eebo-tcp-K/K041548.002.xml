            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>Yet one excelling Greek, &amp;c.</hi>]</l>
                     <p>Dionyſius of Halicarnaſſus, the celebrated hiſtorian and critic of the Auguſtan age, who ſettled in Italy, as he himſelf informs us, on the cloſe of the civil war. He has addreſſed a little treatiſe, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a critique on the elder hiſtorians, to his friend Cnaeus Pompeius, whom the French cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics ſuppoſe to be Pompey the Great; but Reiſke, the laſt editor of Dionyſius, has ſunk him into a petty Greek grammarian, the client or freed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of that illuſtrious Roman.</p>
                     <p>In this treatiſe of Dionyſius, and in one ſtill longer, on the character of Thucydides, there are ſome excellent hiſtorical precepts, which Mr. Spelman has judiciouſly thrown together in the preface to his admirable tranſlation of the Roman Antiquities.—He introduces them by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing obſervation, which may ſerve perhaps to recommend the ſubject of the preſent poem.—<q rend="inline">"So much has been ſaid, both by the antients
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0310600102:93"/>
and the moderns, in praiſe of the advantages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the ſtudy of Hiſtory, particularly by Diodorus Siculus among the former, in the noble preface to his Hiſtorical Collections; and by the late Lord Bolingbroke, among the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, in his admirable letter on that ſubject; that I am aſtoniſhed no treatiſe has ever yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in any age, or any language, profeſſedly written to preſcribe rules for writing Hiſtory; a work allowed to be of the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all others to mankind, the repoſitory of truth, fraught with leſſons both of public and private virtue, and enforced by ſtronger motives than precepts—by examples. Rules for Poetry and Rhetoric have been written by many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, both antient and modern, as if delight and eloquence were of greater conſequence than inſtruction: however, Rhetoric was a part of Hiſtory, as treated by the antients; not the principal part indeed, but ſubſervient to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; and calculated to apply the facts exhibited by the narration. I know it may be ſaid, that many antient hiſtories are ſtill preſerved, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0310600102:94"/>
that theſe models are ſufficient guides for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Hiſtorians, without particular rules: ſo had the Greeks Poets of all denominations in their hands, and yet Ariſtotle thought it neceſſary to preſcribe particular rules to his countrymen for applying thoſe examples to every branch of Poetry: I wiſh he had done the ſame in Hiſtory; if he had, it is very probable that his precepts would have rendered the beſt of our modern Hiſtories more perfect, and the worſt, leſs abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.—Since the reſurrection of letters, the want of ſuch a guide has been complained of by many authors, and particularly by Rapin, in the preface to his Hiſtory of England."</q>
                        <bibl>—Spelman, page 15.</bibl>—But this ingenious and learned wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeaks a little too ſtrongly, in ſaying no treatiſe has ever appeared in any age or language, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining rules for Hiſtory. There is one in Latin by the celebrated Voſſius, entitled Ars Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; another by Hubertus Folieta, an elegant Latin writer, of the 16th century, on whom Thuanus beſtows the higheſt commendation; and Maſcardi, an Italian critic, patroniſed by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0310600102:95"/>
Cardinal Mazarine, has written alſo dell Arte Hiſtorica. The curious reader may find a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular anecdote relating to the publication of this work in Bayle, under the article Maſcardi.—But to return to Dionyſius. In comparing Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus and Thucydides, he cenſures the latter with a degree of ſeverity unwarranted by truth and reaſon: indeed this ſeverity appeared ſo ſtriking to the learned Fabricius, that he ſeems to conſider it as a kind of proof, that the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical works of Dionyſius were compoſed in the haſty fervor of youth. They are however in general, to uſe the words of the ſame ingenious author, eximia &amp; lectu digna; and a valuable critic of our own country, who reſembles Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius in elegance of compoſition, and perhaps in ſeverity of judgment, has ſpoken yet more warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their favour.—<bibl>See Warton's Eſſay on Pope, 3d edit. page 175.</bibl>

                     <p>This ſingular inſtitution, which is alluded to by many of our late authors, is related at large in the Firſt Book of Diodorus Siculus; and as the paſſage is curious, the following free tranſlation of it may afford entertainment to the Engliſh reader—<q rend="inline">"Thoſe who prepare to bury a relation, give notice of the day intended for the ceremony to the judges, and to all the friends of the deceaſed; informing them, that the body will paſs over the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0310600102:98"/>
lake of that diſtrict to which the dead belonged: when, on the judges being aſſembled, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of more than forty, and ranging themſelves in a ſemicircle on the farther ſide of the lake, the veſſel is ſet afloat, which thoſe who ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the funeral have prepared for this purpoſe. This veſſel is managed by a pilot, called in the Egyptian language Charon; and hence they ſay, that Orpheus, travelling in old times into Egypt, and ſeeing this ceremony, formed his fable of the infernal regions, partly from what he ſaw, and partly from invention. The veſſel being launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the lake, before the coffin which contains the body is put on board, the law permits all, who are ſo inclined, to produce an accuſation againſt it.—If any one ſteps forth, and proves that the deceaſed has led an evil life, the judges pronounce ſentence, and the body is precluded from burial; but if the accuſer is convicted of injuſtice in his charge, he falls himſelf under a conſiderable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. When no accuſer appears, or when the accuſer is proved to be an unfair one, the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who are aſſembled, change their expreſſions

of ſorrow into encomiums on the dead: yet they do not, like the Greeks, ſpeak in honour of his family, becauſe they conſider all Egyptians as equally well-born; but they ſet forth the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manners of his youth, his piety and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in maturer life, his moderation, and every virtue by which he was diſtinguiſhed; and they ſupplicate the infernal Deities to receive him as an aſſociate among the bleſt.

                     <p>One great purpoſe in all eminent and expenſive ſtructures is to pleaſe the ſtranger and traveller, and to win their admiration. This is effected ſometimes by a mixture of magnificence and beauty: at other times ſolely by immenſity and grandeur. The latter ſeems to have been the object in the erecting of thoſe celebrated build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Egypt: and they certainly have anſwered the deſign. For not only the vaſtneſs of their ſtructure, and the area which they occupy, but the ages they have endured, and the very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their hiſtory, which runs ſo far back into the depths of antiquity, produce all together a wonderful veneration; to which buildings more

exquiſite and embelliſhed are ſeldom entitled. Many have ſuppoſed, that they were deſigned for places of ſepulture: and it has been affirmed by Herodotus, and other antient writers. But they ſpoke by gueſs: and I have ſhewn by many inſtances, how uſual it was for the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to miſtake temples for tombs. If the chief Pyramid were deſigned for a place of burial, what occaſion was there for a well, and for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of communication which led to other build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Near the Pyramids are apartments of a wonderful fabric, which extend in length one thouſand four hundred feet, and about thirty in depth. They have been cut out of the hard rock, and brought to a perpendicular by the artiſt's chizel; and through dint of labour faſhioned as they now appear. They were undoubtedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the reception of prieſts; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently were not appendages to a tomb, but to a temple of the Deity . . . . . . The prieſts of Egypt delighted in obſcurity; and they probably came by the ſubterraneous paſſages of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dark chambers within; where they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

Many of the antient temples in this country were caverns in the rock, enlarged by art, and cut out into numberleſs dreary apartments: for no nation upon earth was ſo addicted to gloom and melancholy as the Egyptians.—<bibl>BRYANT's Analyſis, Vol. III.

From the heavy charges brought againſt him by the antients, the famous Henry Stephens, and his learned friend Camerarius, have defended their favourite Hiſtorian with great ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

                     <p>Tacitus was born, according to the conjecture of Lipſius, in the cloſe of the reign of Claudius: paſſing through various public honours, he roſe at length to the conſular dignity, under Nerva, in the year of Chriſt 97. The date of his death is unknown,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0310600102:118"/>
but he is ſaid to have lived happily to an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced age with his wife, the amiable daughter of the virtuous Agricola, whoſe life he has ſo beautifully written. By this lady he is ſuppoſed to have left children; and the emperor Tacitus is conjectured to have been a remote deſcendant from the Hiſtorian, to whoſe works and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he paid the higheſt regard.—It is reported by Sidonius Apollinaris, that Tacitus recommended the province of writing Hiſtory to Pliny the Younger, and that he did not himſelf engage in that employment, till his friend had declined it. This is not mentioned, indeed, in any of the beautiful letters ſtill remaining from Pliny to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus; but it is an inſtance of delicacy not unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd among the Antients, as will appear from the following remark by one of the moſt elegant and liberal of modern critics.—<q rend="inline">"The Roman Poet, who was not more eminent by his genius than amiable in his moral character, affords per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the moſt remarkable inſtance that any where occurs, of the conceſſions which a mind ſtrongly impregnated with ſentiments of genuine
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0310600102:119"/>
amity, is capable of making. Virgil's ſuperior ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents rendered him qualified to excel in all the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler ſpecies of poetical compoſition: nevertheleſs, from the moſt uncommon delicacy of friendſhip, he ſacrificed to his intimacy with Horace, the unrivall'd reputation he might have acquired by indulging his lyric vein; as from the ſame refined motive he forbore to exerciſe his dramatic pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that he might not obſcure the glory of his friend Varius.<q>

                     <p>As to Tacitus, it is clear, I think, from the Letters of Pliny, as well as from his own moſt pleaſing Life of Agricola, that he poſſeſſed all the refined and affectionate feelings of the heart in a very high degree, though the general caſt of his hiſtorical works might lead us to imagine that auſterity was his chief characteriſtic.—It would be eaſy to fill a volume in tranſcribing the great

encomiums, and the violent cenſures, which have been laviſhed by modern writers of almoſt every country on this profound Hiſtorian.—The laſt critic of eminence, who has written againſt him, in Britain, is, I believe, the learned Author of The Origin and Progreſs of Language; who, in his 3d volume of that work, has made many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious remarks on the compoſition of the antient Hiſtorians, and is particularly ſevere on the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tacitus.

According to the learned Fabricius,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0310600102:121"/>
he was born under Claudius, 50 years after the Chriſtian aera, raiſed to the conſular dignity under Trajan, whoſe preceptor he is ſaid to have been, and made Procurator of Greece in his old age by the Emperor Adrian—in the 5th year of whoſe reign he is ſuppoſed to have died, at the age of 70. He was married to a moſt amiable woman of his own native town Chaeronea, whoſe name was Timoxena, and to whoſe ſenſe and virtue he has borne the moſt affectionate teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in his moral works; of which it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted that we have no elegant tranſlation. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed even the Lives of Plutarch, the moſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of all the antient hiſtorical compoſitions, were chiefly known to the Engliſh reader by a mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and miſerable verſion, till a new one, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with fidelity and ſpirit, was preſented to the public by the Langhornes in 1770.</p>

while they are hurried along the ſtream, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them not to ſink into the abyſs of oblivion.</p>
                                 <p>On this conſideration, I Anna, the daughter of the emperor Alexius, and his conſort Irene, born and educated in imperial ſplendor—not utterly void of literature, and ſolicitous to diſtinguiſh myſelf by that Grecian characteriſtic—as I have already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied myſelf to Rhetoric, and having thoroughly ſtudied the Principles of Ariſtotle and the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of Plato, have endeavoured to adorn my mind with the <note n="*" place="bottom">Aſtrology, Geometry, Arithmetic, and Muſic.</note>four uſual branches of education (for I think it incumbent on me, even at the riſque of appearing vain, to declare what qualifications for the preſent taſk I have received from nature, or gained by application; what Providence has beſtowed upon me, or time and opportunity ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.) On theſe accounts, I am deſirous of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating, in my preſent work, the actions of my father, as they deſerve not to be buried in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or to be plunged, as it were, by the tide of Time, into the ocean of Oblivion: both thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0310600102:126"/>
which he performed after he obtained the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem, and thoſe before that period, while he was himſelf a ſubject of other Princes. I engage in this narration, not ſo much to diſplay any little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for compoſition, as to prevent tranſactions of ſuch importance from periſhing unrecorded: ſince even the brighteſt of human atchievements, if not conſigned to memory under the guard of writing, are extinguiſhed, as it were, by the Darkneſs of Silence.</p>
                                 <p>My father was a man, who knew both how to govern, and to pay to governors a becoming obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: but in chuſing his actions for my ſubject, I am apprehenſive, in the very outſet of my work, leſt I may be cenſured as the Panegyriſt of my own family for writing of my father; that if I ſpeak of him with admiration, my whole Hiſtory will be conſidered as a falſe and flattering encomium; and if any circumſtance, I may have occaſion to mention, leads me, as it were by force, to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſome part even of his conduct, I am appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, on the other hand, not from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0310600102:127"/>
of my father, but from the very nature of things, that ſome malignant cenſurers may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare me to Cham, the ſon of Noah; ſince there are many, whom envy and malevolence will not ſuffer to form a fair judgment, and who, to ſpeak in the words of Homer,
<q>
                                       <l>Are keen to cenſure, where no blame is due.</l>
                                    </q>
For whoever engages in the province of Hiſtory, is bound to forget all ſentiments both of favour and averſion; and often to adorn his enemies with the higheſt commendations, when their actions are entitled to ſuch reward; and often to cenſure his moſt intimate friends, when the failings of their life and manners require it.—Theſe are duties equally incumbent on the Hiſtorian, which he cannot decline. As to myſelf, with regard to thoſe who may be affected either by my cenſure or my praiſe, I would wiſh to aſſure them, that I ſpeak both of them, and their conduct, according to the evidence of their actions themſelves, or the report of thoſe who beheld them; for either the fathers, or the grandfathers, of many perſons now living
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0310600102:128"/>
were ocular witneſſes of what I ſhall record. I have been chiefly led to engage in this Hiſtory of my father by the following circumſtance:—It was my fortune to marry Caeſar Nicephorus, of the Bryennian family, a man far ſuperior to all his cotemporaries, not only in perſonal beauty, but in ſublimity of underſtanding, and all the charms of eloquence! for he was equally the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of thoſe who ſaw, and thoſe who heard him. But that my diſcourſe may not wander from its preſent purpoſe, let me proceed in my narration!—He was then, among all men, the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; and when he marched with the emperor John Comnenus, my brother, on his expedition againſt Antioch, and other places in poſſeſſion of the Barbarians, ſtill unable to abſtain from litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry purſuits, even in thoſe ſcenes of labour and fatigue, he wrote various compoſitions worthy of remembrance and of honour. But he chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to the writing an account of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to my father Alexius, emperor of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, at the requeſt of the empreſs; reducing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0310600102:129"/>
proper form the tranſactions of his reign, whenever the times would allow him to devote ſhort intervals of leiſure from arms and battle to works of literature, and the labour of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In forming this Hiſtory, he deduced his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts from an early period, being directed in this point alſo by the inſtruction of our royal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; beginning from the emperor Diogenes, and deſcending to the perſon, whom he had choſen for the Hero of his Drama—for this ſeaſon firſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my father to be a youth of expectation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this period he was a mere infant; and of courſe performed nothing worthy of being recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: unleſs even the occurrences of his childhood ſhould be thought a fit ſubject for Hiſtory. Such then was the deſign and ſcope of Caeſar's compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: but he failed in the hope he had entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of bringing his Hiſtory to its concluſion: for having brought it to the times of the emperor Nicephorus Botoniates, he there broke off, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no future opportunity allowed him of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing his narration: a circumſtance which has
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0310600102:130"/>
proved a ſevere loſs to Literature, and robbed his readers of delight!—On this account I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to record the actions of my father, that ſuch atchievements may not eſcape poſterity. What degree of harmony and grace the writings of Caeſar poſſeſſed, all perſons know who have been fortunate enough to ſee his compoſitions. But having executed his work to the period I have mentioned, in the midſt of hurry and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and bringing it to us half finiſhed from his expedition, he brought home, alas! at the ſame time, a diſorder that proved mortal, contracted perhaps from the hardſhips of his paſſage, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from that harraſſing ſcene of perpetual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and poſſibly indeed from his infinite anxiety on my account; for anxiety was natural to his affectionate heart, and his labours were without intermiſſion. Moreover, the change and badneſs of climates might prepare for him this draught of death. For notwithſtanding the dreadful ſtate of his health, he perſevered in the campaign againſt the Syrians and Cilicians, till at length he was
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0310600102:131"/>
conveyed out of Syria in a moſt infirm ſtate, and was brought through Cilicia, Pamphilia, Lydia, and Bithynia, home to the metropolis of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and to his family. But his vitals were now affected by his infinite fatigue.—Even in this ſtate of weakneſs he was deſirous of diſplaying the events of his expedition: but this his diſorder rendered him unable to execute, and indeed we enjoined him not to attempt it, leſt by the effort of ſuch a narration he ſhould burſt open his wound.—But in the recollection of theſe things, my whole ſoul is darkened, and my eyes are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a flood of tears.—O what a director of the Roman counſels was then torn from us! O what an end was there to all the treaſures of clear, of various, and of uſeful knowledge, which he had collected from obſervation and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, both in regard to foreign affairs, and the internal buſineſs of the empire!—O what a form was then deſtroyed!—Beauty, that ſeemed not only entitled to dominion, but bearing even the ſemblance of divinity!—I indeed have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0310600102:132"/>
with every calamity; and have found, even from the imperial cradle, an unpropitious fortune: ſome perhaps might eſteem that fortune not unpropitious, which ſeemed to ſmile upon my birth, in giving me ſovereigns for my parents, and nurſing me in the imperial purple: but for the other circumſtances of my life, alas, what tempeſts! alas, what perturbations! The melody of Orpheus affected even inanimate nature; and Timotheus, in playing the Orthic ſong to Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, made the Macedon ſtart to arms.</p>
                                 <p>The relation of my miſeries would not, indeed, produce ſuch effects; but it would move every auditor to tears; it would force not only beings endued with ſenſibility, but even inanimate nature to ſympathize in my ſorrow.—This remembrance of Caeſar, and his unexpected death, tears open the deepeſt wound of my ſoul: indeed I conſider all my former misfortunes, if compared to this immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureable calamity, but as a drop of water to the Atlantic ſea; or rather my earlier afflictions were a kind of prelude to this: they firſt involved
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0310600102:133"/>
me, as it were, like a ſmoke preceding this raging fire; they were a kind of heat, that portended a conflagration, which no words can deſcribe. O thou fire, that blazeſt without fuel, preying on my heart without deſtroying its exiſtence; piercing through my very bones, and ſhrinking up my ſoul!—But I perceive myſelf hurried away from my ſubject: this mention of Caeſar, and what I ſuffer in his loſs, has led me into the prolixity of grief: wiping therefore the tear from my eyes, and reſtraining myſelf from this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of ſorrow, I will proceed in order; yet, as the tragic Poet<note n="*" place="bottom">Euripides.</note>

                     <p>It is now generally agreed, that the Hiſtory which bears the name of Turpin, Archbiſhop of Rheims, was the forgery of a Monk, at the time of the Cruſades; though Pope Calixtus the Second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be authentic.—But, as it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly intended to paſs as genuine Hiſtory, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was compoſed, and actually did ſo for ſome ages, this poetical mention of it appeared not improper. For the entertainment of the curious reader, I ſhall tranſcribe the two mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous paſſages alluded to in the poem:—<q rend="inline">Ante diem belli, caſtris et arietibus et turmis praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis in pratis, ſcilicet quae ſunt inter caſtrum,

This book he brought into England, and communicated it to Geoffrey of Monmouth,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0310600102:144"/>
a Welſh Benedictine Monk, an elegant writer of Latin, and admirably ſkilled in the Britiſh tongue. Geoffrey, at the requeſt and recommendation of Gualter the Archdeacon, tranſlated this Britiſh Chronicle into Latin, executing the Tranſlation with a tolerable degree of purity, and great fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, yet not without ſome interpolations.—It was probably finiſhed after the year 1138."</q>—<q rend="inline">"The ſimple ſubject of this Chronicle, diveſted of its romantic embelliſhments, is a deduction of the Welſh Princes from the Trojan Brutus to Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader, who reigned in the ſeventh century."</q> To this extract from Mr. Warton, it may be proper to add a conciſe account of that romantic embelliſhment, to which I have particularly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded:—Uther Pendragon, at the feſtival of his coronation, falls in love with Igerna, the wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall; and being prevented from purſuing his addreſſes by the vigilance of the huſband, he applies to the magical power of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin for the completion of his deſire.—This he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, by being transformed into the perſon of

He is juſtly called, by almoſt every writer on Engliſh Hiſtory, the moſt liberal and judicious of all our monaſtic Hiſtorians. His
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0310600102:146"/>
principal work is a Hiſtory of our Kings, from the arrival of the Saxons to the 20th year of Henry the Firſt. This was followed by two books of later Hiſtory, which cloſe with the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated eſcape of the Empreſs Matilda from the Caſtle of Oxford, 1142. Theſe works are both addreſſed to that munificent patron of merit, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Earl of Glouceſter, natural ſon of Henry the Firſt; who was perhaps the moſt exalted and accompliſhed character that ever flouriſhed in ſo barbarous an age. The Hiſtorian ſpeaks of his noble friend with all the ſimplicity of truth, and all the warmth of virtuous admiration. He died, according to Pitts, in 1143, three years before his generous patron; and this is probable, from his not purſuing his Hiſtory, which he intimates a deſign of reſuming.—Yet there is a paſſage preſerved in Tanner, from the Preface to his Comments on Jeremiah, which ſeems to prove, that he lived to a later period; ſince he mentions his hiſtorical works as the production of his younger days, and ſpeaks of his age as devoted to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0310600102:147"/>
religious compoſition. Beſides his four books De geſtis Pontificum Anglorum, he wrote many works of the ſame pious turn, which the curious reader may ſee enumerated in Tanner's Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca.</p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0310600102:151"/>
his hiſtorical and geographical productions; and theſe, notwithſtanding their acknowledged merit, have appeared only in ſelected fragments.

The honour of doing juſtice to this illuſtrious author ſeems to be reſerved for Germany; where the learned Michaelis has lately publiſhed his deſcription of Egypt, and intimates an intention of printing the other parts of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Of his general Hiſtory, which he brought down to the latter years of his own life, different portions have been given to the public by different editors—his account of Mahomet, by Gagnier, printed at Oxford, in folio, 1723; his Hiſtory of the Arabian Caliphs, to the year of the Hegira 406, by Reiſke, printed at Leipſic 1754—and his narrative of all the circumſtances relating to the great Saladin has been very properly annexed by
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0310600102:152"/>

                     <p>The Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Corduba was founded by Al Hakem the Second, who died in the 336th year of the Hegira, after a reign of fifteen years and five months. He was the ſon and ſucceſſor of the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Abdelrahman the Third, who in a long and proſperous life had given ſtability and ſplendor to the Mooriſh empire in Spain. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that many of theſe Arab Princes were not only protectors of literature, but often diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves by poetical compoſition. Nor were the Mooriſh Ladies leſs eager to cultivate the moſt elegant of mental accompliſhments: Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, or Valadata, the daughter of the Prince who founded the Univerſity, was no leſs celebrated for her poetical talents, than for her ſingular beauty and exalted birth. She beſtowed her protection

                     <p>Bohaddin, or Bohadin (for his name is variouſly written), is conjectured by Schultens, his learned Tranſlator, to have been an Aſſyrian by birth, and a native of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0310600102:156"/>
Moſula, the metropolis of Meſopotamia; from whence, before he entered into the ſervice of Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din, he was ſent embaſſador, as he himſelf relates, to the Caliph of Bagdad.—He ſeems to have been principally indebted to his talents as an Hiſtorian, for the protection and favour of that engaging hero, whoſe confidence he afterwards obtained, and whoſe ſplendid character he has ſo warmly celebrated. For as he was returning from Mecca to Moſula, he embraced an opportunity of preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saladin an account of the holy war, as he terms it, which he had drawn up as he ſtopt at Damaſcus in the courſe of his pilgrimage, and in which he had deſcribed the adminiſtration and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of that monarch. He affirms that the Sultan peruſed his work with infinite ſatisfaction, and expreſſed the moſt eager deſire to engage him in his ſervice. The grateful Hiſtorian was no leſs inclined to devote himſelf to his generous and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic patron.—From this period he ſeems to have been a favourite companion of his warlike maſter; to have ſhared many of his dangers, as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0310600102:157"/>
well as his moſt ſecret counſels; and to have ſerved him, with a moſt zealous and affectionate attachment, to the hour of his death—an event of which he ſpeaks with the affecting ſimplicity of real ſorrow. In mentioning the oriental cuſtom of waſhing the body of the deceaſed, he records the name of the miniſter who performed the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and adds, that he had himſelf engaged in this mournful office, but was obliged to retire, on feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf unequal to ſo painful a ſcene.—The work of this intereſting Biographer is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts: the firſt exhibits a general charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the hero, with particular examples of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious virtues and endowments; the ſecond gives a chronological account of his adventures, from his firſt expedition into Egypt to the cloſe of his life; but paſſing lightly over his other exploits, dwells chiefly on the tranſactions of the holy war; and diſcovers ſuch marks of religious zeal, that Schul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens very ſhrewdly ſuppoſes the author to have been a prieſt, from the manner in which he laviſhes his maledictions. It is juſt, however, to obſerve, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0310600102:158"/>
he ſpeaks very liberally on the martial merit of his Chriſtian enemies; and there is one paſſage in his hiſtory, in which he pays a very pleaſing and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic compliment to the univerſal philanthropy of the Sultan: it is in relating an anecdote which affords ſo intereſting a picture, that I cannot help preſenting it to my reader:</p>
                     <p>In the army of Saladin there were ſome dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous robbers, who uſed to penetrate by night into the camp of the Chriſtians, and preſent to the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, on their return, ſuch booty as they had been able to bring off; which he beſtowed upon them, as a reward of their valour. In one of their nightly excurſions they happened to ſeize an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant of three months: the mother, robbed of her little one, ſpent the night in the moſt bitter lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and related her misfortune to the Chriſtian leaders. They anſwered, The Sultan is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, and we therefore give you permiſſion to depart, and petition him for your child, which he will certainly reſtore.—Approaching our guard, ſhe relates her ſtory, and implores their aſſiſtance. They give her acceſs to the Sultan, to whom, as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0310600102:159"/>
he was riding, attended by myſelf and others, ſhe preſented herſelf bathed in tears, and proſtrate in the duſt. He enquires the cauſe of her affliction:—ſhe repeats her ſtory:—the Sultan is moved even to tears, and orders the child to be produced. On finding that it had been publicly ſold, he commands it to be redeemed; and reſted not till he ſaw the infant delivered to its mother. Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with a profuſion of tears, ſhe preſt it to her boſom—the ſurrounding ſpectators (and I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be among them) wept with her—ſhe then gave her breaſt to the infant; after which the Sultan directed her to be ſeated on horſeback with her little one, and ſafely eſcorted to her own quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Conſider (exclaims the affectionate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Hiſtorian) this example of univerſal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence! Such, O God! haſt thou created this merciful ſovereign, to appear moſt worthy of thy own infinite mercy.—Conſider this teſtimony, which even his enemies have borne of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate and generous diſpoſition! <bibl>BOHAD.

                     <p>John Froiſſart, Canon and Treaſurer of the collegiate church of Chimay, in Henault, was born at Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenciennes, a city of that province, in 1337, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conjecture of that elaborate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious antiquarian Mr. de St. Palaye; who has amply illuſtrated the Life and Writings of this engaging Hiſtorian, in a ſeries of diſſertations among the Memoirs of the French Academy, Vol. X. XIII. XIV.—St. Palaye imagines, from a paſſage in the MS Poems of Froiſſart, that his father was a painter of Armories—and it is certain the Hiſtorian diſcovers a paſſion for all the pomp and all the minutiae of heraldry: it was indeed the favourite ſtudy of that martial age; and Froiſſart, more the prieſt of gallantry than of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, devoted himſelf entirely to the celebration of love and war.—At the age of 20, he began to write Hiſtory, at the requeſt <hi>de ſon cher Seigneur &amp; Maitre Meſſire</hi> Robert de Namur, Chevalier Seigneur de Beaufort.—The anguiſh of unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0310600102:161"/>
love drove him early into England, and his firſt voyage ſeems a kind of emblem of his future life; for he ſailed hither in a ſtorm, yet continued writing a rondeau in ſpite of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, till he found himſelf on that coaſt, ou l'on aime mieux la guerre, que la paix, &amp; ou les eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trangers ſont très bien venus, as he ſaid of our country <hi>in his verſes,</hi> and happily experienced in his kind reception at court, where Philippa of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault, the Queen of Edward the Third, and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs of learning, diſtinguiſhed the young Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, her countryman, by the kindeſt protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, finding that love had rendered him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, ſupplied him with money and with horſes, that he might preſent himſelf with every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage before the object of his paſſion.—Love ſoon eſcorted him to his miſtreſs—but his addreſſes were again unſucceſsful; and, taking a ſecond voyage to England, he became Secretary to his royal patroneſs Philippa, in 1361, after having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her ſome portion of his Hiſtory.—He continued five years in her ſervice, entertaining
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0310600102:162"/>
her majeſty <hi>de beaux dictiez &amp; traictez amoureux:</hi> in this period he paid a viſit to Scotland, and was entertained 15 days by William earl Douglas.—In 1366, when Edward the Black Prince was preparing for the war in Spain, Froiſſart was with him in Gaſcony, and hoped to attend him during the whole courſe of that important expedition:—but the Prince ſent him back to the Queen his mother.—He continued not long in England, as he viſited many of the Italian courts in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year; and during his travels ſuſtained the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable loſs of that patroneſs, to whoſe bounty he had been ſo much indebted.—Philippa died 1369, and Froiſſart is reported to have written the life of his amiable protectreſs; but of this performance the reſearches of St. Palaye could diſcover no trace.</p>
                     <p>After this event, he retired to his own country, and obtained the benefice of Leſtines, in the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe of Cambray.—But the cure of ſouls was an office little ſuited to the gay and gallant Froiſſart.—His genius led him ſtill to travel from caſtle to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0310600102:163"/>
caſtle, and from court to court, to uſe the words of Mr. Warton, who has made occaſional mention of our author, in his elegant Hiſtory of Engliſh Poetry.—Froiſſart now entered into the ſervice of the Duke of Brabant; and, as that Prince was himſelf a poet, Froiſſart collected all the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his maſter, and adding ſome of his own, formed a kind of romance, which he calls
<q>
                           <l>Un Livre de Meliador</l>

                           <l>Toutes les chançons que jadis,</l>

The Duke died in 1384, before this work was completed; and Froiſſart ſoon found a new patron in Guy earl of Blois, on the marriage of whoſe Son he wrote a Paſtoral, entitled Le Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple d'Honneur.—The Earl having requeſted him to reſume his Hiſtory, he travelled for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the celebrated court of Gaſton earl of Foix, whoſe high reputation for every knightly virtue attracted to his reſidence, at Orlaix, thoſe martial adventurers, from whoſe mouth it was the delight of Froiſſart to collect the materials of his Hiſtory.—The courteous Gaſton gave him the moſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering reception: he ſaid to him with a ſmile (&amp; en bon François) <q rend="inline">"qu'il le connoiſſoit bien, quoyqu'il ne l'euſt jamais veu, mais qu'il avoit bien oui parler de luy, &amp; le retint de ſon hoſtel."</q>—It became a favourite amuſement of the Earl, to hear Froiſſart read his Romance of Meliador after ſupper.—He attended in the caſtle every night at 12, when the Earl ſate down to table, liſtened to him with extreme attention, and never diſmiſſed him, till he had made him vuider tout ce

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0310600102:166"/>
of his life. The ground-work of this poem (which is not in the liſt of our Author's poetical pieces, that Mr. Warton has given us from Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier) ſeems to have a ſtrong vein of humour.—It is a dialogue between the Poet and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Florin that he has left, out of the many which he had either ſpent, or been obliged to ſurrender to the robbers.—He repreſents himſelf as a man of the moſt expenſive turn: in 25 years he had ſquandered two thouſand franks, beſides his eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical revenues. The compoſition of his works had coſt him 700; but he regretted not this ſum, as he expected to be amply repaid for it by the praiſe of poſterity.</p>
                     <p>After having attended all the feſtivals on the marriage of the Duke of Berry, having traverſed many parts of France, and paid a viſit to Zeland, he returned to his own country in 1390, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his Hiſtory from the various materials he had collected.—But not ſatisfied with the relations he had heard of the war in Spain, he went to Middlebourgh in Zeland, in purſuit of a Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0310600102:167"/>
Knight, Jean Ferrand Portelet, vaillant homme &amp; ſage, &amp; du Conſeil du Roy de Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal. From this accompliſhed ſoldier Froiſſart expected the moſt perfect information, as an ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar witneſs of thoſe ſcenes which he now wiſhed to record.—The courteous Portelet received our indefatigable Hiſtorian with all the kindneſs which his enthuſiaſm deſerved; and in ſix days, which they paſſed together, gave him all the intelligence he deſired.—Froiſſart now returned home, and finiſhed the third book of his Hiſtory.—Many years had paſt ſince he had bid adieu to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Taking advantage of the truce then eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed between France and that country, he paid it another viſit in 1395, with letters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to the King and his uncles.—From Dover he proceeded to Canterbury, to pay his devoirs at the ſhrine of Thomas of Becket, and to the memory of the Black Prince.—Here he happened to find the ſon of that hero, the young King Richard, whom devotion had alſo brought to make his offerings to the faſhionable Saint,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0310600102:168"/>
and return thanks to Heaven for his ſucceſſes in Ireland.—Froiſſart ſpeaks of this adventure, and his own feelings on the great change of ſcene that had taken place ſince his laſt viſit to England, in the following natural and lively terms:<q rend="inline">—Le Roy . . . vint . . a trez grant arroy, et bien accompaigne de ſeigneurs, de dames, et demoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles, et me mis entre eulx, &amp; entre elles, et tout me ſembla nouvel, ne je ny congnoiſſoye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonne; car le tems eſtoit bien change en Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre depuis le tems de vingt &amp; huyt ans: et en la compagnie du roy n'avoit nuls de ſes oncles . . . . ſi fus du premier ainſi que tout eſbahy . . .</q> Tho' Froiſſart was thus embarraſſed in not finding one of his old friends in the reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the King, he ſoon gained a new Patron in Thomas Percy, Maſter of the Houſehold, who offered to preſent him and his letters to Richard; but this offer happening on the eve of the King's departure, it proved too late for the ceremony—<q rend="inline">Le Roy eſtoit retrait pour aller dormir.</q>—And on the morrow, when the impatient Hiſtorian at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0310600102:169"/>

the ſcenes of real action, than to liſten to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant fictions of a popular legend.—But here he was again diſappointed.—New companions joined them on the road, and their hiſtorical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was thus interrupted.—Theſe mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſoon repaid by the kind reception he met with from the Duke of York, who ſaid to him, when he received the recommendatory let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Earl of Henault, <q rend="inline">"Maiſtre Jehan tenez vous toujours deles nous, &amp; nos gens, nous vous ferons tout amour &amp; courtoiſie, nous y ſommes tenus pour l'amour du tems paſſé &amp; de notre dame de mere à qui vous futes; nous en avons bien la ſouvenance."</q>—With theſe flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marks of remembrance and favour, the Duke preſented him to the <q rend="inline">King, lequel me receut joyeuſement et doulcement (continues Froiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart) . . et ne diſt que je fuſſe le bien venus et ſi j'avoye eſte de l'hoſtel du Roy ſon Ayeul &amp; de Madame ſon Ayeule encores eſtoys je de l'hoſtel d'Angleterre.</q>—Some time however elapſed, before he had an opportunity of preſenting his

romance of Meliador, which he had prepared for the King.—The Duke of York and his other friends at length obtained for him this honour. He gives the following curious and particular account of the ceremony: <q rend="inline">Et voulut veoir le Roy mon livre, que je luy avoye apporte. Si le vit en ſa chambre: car tout pourveu je l'avoye, et luy mis fur ſon lict. Et lors il l'ouvrit et regarda dedans, et luy pleut tres grandement.

After paſſing three months in this court, Froiſſart took his leave of the munificent but ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fated Richard. In the laſt chapter of his Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, where he mentions the unfortunate end of this Monarch, he ſpeaks with an honeſt and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting gratitude of the liberal preſent he received from him on his departure from England.—It was a goblet of ſilver gilt, weighing two marks, and filled with a hundred nobles.</p>
                     <p>On leaving England, he retired to his own country, and is ſuppoſed to have ended his days at his benefice of Chimay; but the year of his death is uncertain.—There is an ancient tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the country, ſays Mr. de Saint Palaye, that he was buried in the chapel of St. Anne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his own church.—That ingenious antiquarian produces an extract from its archives, in which the death of Froiſſart is recorded, but without naming the year, in the moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms.—His obit bears the date of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, and is followed by 20 Latin verſes,

                     <p>Nicholas Machiavel, the celebrated Florentine, was firſt patronized by Leo, who cauſed one of his comedies to be acted with great magnificence at Rome, and engaged him to write a private Treatiſe de Reformatione Reipublicae Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinae. His famous political Eſſay, intitled, "The Prince," was publiſhed in 1515, and dedicated to the Nephew of that Pontiff. The various judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that have been paſſed on this ſingular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, are a ſtriking proof of the incertitude of human opinion.—In England it has received applauſe from the great names of Bacon and Clarendon, who ſuppoſe it intended to promote
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0310600102:178"/>
the intereſt of liberty and virtue. In Italy, after many years of approbation, it was publicly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Clement the VIIIth, at the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Jeſuit, who had not read the book. In France it has even been ſuppoſed inſtrumental to the horrid maſſacre of St. Bartholomew, as the favourite ſtudy of Catherine of Medicis and her Sons, and as teaching the bloody leſſons of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation which they ſo fatally put in practice. Yet one of his French Tranſlators has gone ſo far as to ſay, that <q rend="inline">"Machiavel, who paſſes among all the world for a teacher of Tyranny, deteſted it more than any man of the age in which he lived."</q> It muſt however be owned, that there is a great mixture of good and evil in his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical precepts. For the latter many plauſible apologies have been made: and it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered to his honour, that his great aim was to promote the welfare of his country, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the Houſe of Medicis to deliver Italy from the invaſion of foreigners.</p>

His Hiſtory of that republic he wrote at the requeſt of Clement the VIIth, as we are informed in his Dedication of it to that Pontiff.

entry into Florence.—That diſcerning Pontiff immediately became his Patron, and raiſed him to the government of Modena and Reggio. He ſucceeded to that of Parma, which he defended with great ſpirit againſt the French, on the death of Leo.—He roſe to the higheſt honours under Clement the VIIth, having the command of all the eccleſiaſtical forces, and being Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Romagna, and laſtly of Bologna, in which city he is ſaid to have received the moſt flattering compliments from the Emperor Charles V.—Having gained much reputation, both civil and military, in various ſcenes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life, he paſſed his latter days in retirement, at his villa near Florence; where he died ſoon after completing his Hiſtory, in the 59th year of his age, 1540. Notwithſtanding the high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Guicciardin, his Hiſtory has been violently attacked, both as to matter and ſtyle.—The honeſt Montaigne inveighs with great warmth againſt the malignant turn of its author; and his own countryman Boccalini, in whoſe

He was recalled from Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua, to read Lectures on Philoſophy in his own convent at Venice; which he did with great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, during the years 1575, 1576, and 1577.—He went to Rome, as Procurator General, in 1585.—Paſſing from thence to Naples, he there formed an acquaintance with the famous Baptiſta Porta, who has left this honourable teſtimony of his univerſal knowledge:—<q rend="inline">Eo doctiorem, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliorem,

quotquot adhuc videre contigerit, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem cognovimus; natum ad Encyclopediam, &amp;c.</q> Nor is this an exaggerated compliment, as there is hardly any ſcience which eſcaped his active mind. His diſcoveries in Optics and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy would be alone ſufficient to immortalize his name, had he not gained immortality by a ſtill nobler exertion of his mental powers, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the liberties of his country againſt the tyranny of Rome. On the firſt attack of Pope Paul V. on two laws of Venice, very wiſely framed to correct the abuſes of the clergy, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paul aroſe as the literary champion of the Republic, and defended its cauſe with great ſpirit and temper, in various compoſitions; though he is ſaid not to be Author of the Treatiſe generally aſcribed to him on the occaſion, and intitled, <hi>The Rights of Sovereigns,</hi> &amp;c.—His chief per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance on the ſubject was, <hi>Conſiderazioni ſopra le Cenſure di Paolo V.</hi>—The Venetians ſhewed a juſt admiration of the ſublime virtue of a Monk, who defended ſo nobly the civil rights of his

country againſt the ſeparate intereſt of the church. In 1606 the Council paſſed a decree in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; which I ſhall tranſcribe in this note, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not found in the common Lives of Father Paul, and becauſe there is hardly any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more pleaſing to the mind, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of a free ſtate rewarding one of its moſt virtuous ſervants with liberality and eſteem.—<q rend="inline">Continuando il R.

from the baſe attempts of that enemy, whom his virtue had provoked. In 1607, after Venice had adjuſted her diſputes with Rome, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of France, the firſt attack was made on the life of Father Paul. He was beſet near his convent, in the evening, by five aſſaſſins, who ſtabbed him in many places, and left him for dead. He recovered, under the care of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Acquapendente, appointed to attend him at the public charge; to whom, as he was ſpeaking on the depth of the principal wound, his patient ſaid pleaſantly, that the world im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it ſtylo Romanae Curiae.—The crime is generally ſuppoſed to have proceeded from the Jeſuits; but the ſecret authors of it were never clearly diſcovered, though the five ruffians were traced by the Venetian Ambaſſador in Rome; where they are ſaid to have been well received at firſt, but failing afterwards in their expected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to have periſhed in miſery and want. The Senate of Venice paid ſuch attention to Father Paul, as expreſſed the higheſt ſenſe of his merit,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0310600102:191"/>
and the moſt affectionate ſolicitude for his ſafety. They not only doubled his ſtipend a ſecond time, but entreated him to chuſe a public reſidence, for the greater ſecurity of his perſon. The munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and care of the Republic was equalled by the modeſty and fortitude of their ſervant. He choſe not to relinquiſh his cell: and, though warned of various machinations againſt his life, he continued to ſerve his country with unabating zeal; diſcovering, in his private letters to his friends, the moſt heroic calmneſs of mind; and ſaying, in anſwer to their admonitions, that <q rend="inline">"no man lives well, who is too anxious for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of life."</q>—Yet the apprehenſions of his friends had too juſt a foundation. In 1609 another conſpiracy was formed, to murder him in his ſleep, by ſome perſons of his own convent; but their treachery was happily diſcovered.—From this time he lived in more cautious retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtill devoting himſelf to the ſervice of the Republic on various occaſions, and acquiring
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0310600102:192"/>
new reputation by many compoſitions. At length the world was ſurpriſed by his Hiſtory of the Council of Trent, firſt publiſhed at London, 1619, with the fictitious name of Pietro Soave Polano; and dedicated to James the Iſt by Antonio de Dominis, the celebrated Archbiſhop of Spalatro, who ſpeaks of the concealed Author as his intimate friend, who had entruſted him with a manuſcript, on which his modeſty ſet a trifling value, but which it ſeemed proper to beſtow upon the world even without his conſent.—The myſtery concerning the publication of this noble work, has never been thoroughly cleared up; and various falſities concerning it have been reported by authors of conſiderable reputation.—It has even been ſaid that James the Iſt had ſome ſhare in the compoſition of the book: if he had, it was probably in forming the name Pietro Soave Polano, which is an anagram of Paolo Sarpi Veneziano, and the only part of the book which bears any relation to the ſtyle or
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0310600102:193"/>
taſte of that Monarch.—Father Paul was ſoon ſuppoſed to be the real Author of the work in queſtion. The Prince of Condé, on a viſit to his cloyſter, expreſsly aſked him, if he was ſo—to which he modeſtly replied, that at Rome it was well known who had written it.—He enjoyed not many years the reputation ariſing from this maſterly production—in 1623 a fever occaſioned his death, which was even more exemplary and ſublime than his life itſelf.—He prepared himſelf for approaching diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the moſt devout compoſure; and, as the liberty of his country was the darling object of his exalted mind, he prayed for its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation with his laſt breath, in the two cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated words Eſto Perpetua.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſingular beauty in the character of Father Paul, which is not only uncommon in his profeſſion, but is rarely found in human nature.—Though he paſſed a long life in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy of the moſt exaſperating kind, and was continually attacked in every manner that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0310600102:194"/>
malignity could ſuggeſt, both his writings and his heart appeared perfectly free from a vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpirit. Devoting all the powers of his mind to the defence of the public cauſe, he ſeemed entirely to forget the injuries that were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually offered to his own perſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                     <p>His conſtitution was extremely delicate, and his intenſe application expoſed him to very frequent and violent diſorders: theſe he greatly remedied by his ſingular temperance, living chiefly on bread, fruits, and water.—This imperfect account of a character deſerving the nobleſt elogium, is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally extracted from an octavo volume, intitled, Memoire Anedote ſpettanti a F. Paolo da Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco Griſelini Veneziano, &amp;c. edit. 2d, 1760. The author of this elaborate work has pointed out ſeveral miſtakes in the French and Engliſh accounts of Father Paul; particularly in the anecdotes related of him by Burnet, in his Life of Biſhop Bedell; and by Mr. Brent, the ſon of his Engliſh Tranſlator.—Some of theſe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

                     <p>Jerom Oſorius was born of a noble family at Liſbon, 1506. He was educated at the univerſity of Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca, and afterwards ſtudied at Paris and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna. On his return to Portugal, he gradually roſe to the Biſhopric of Sylves, to which he was
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0310600102:196"/>
appointed by Catherine of Auſtria, Regent of the kingdom in the minority of Sebaſtian. At the requeſt of Cardinal Henry of Portugal, he wrote his Hiſtory of King Emanuel, and the expedition of Gama—which his great contemporary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moens made at the ſame time the ſubject of his immortal Luſiad; a poem which has at length appeared with due luſtre in our language, being tranſlated with great ſpirit and elegance by Mr. Mickle. It is remarkable, that the Hiſtory of Oſorius, and the Epic Poem of Camoens, were publiſhed in the ſame year, 1572: but the fate of theſe two great Authors was very different; the Poet was ſuffered to periſh in poverty, under the reign of that Henry who patronized the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: yet, allowing for the difference of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, I am inclined to think they poſſeſſed a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of mind. There appear many traces of that high heroic ſpirit, even in the Prieſt Oſorius, which animated the Soldier Camoens; particularly in the pleaſure with which he ſeems to deſcribe the martial manners of his countrymen, under the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0310600102:197"/>
of Emanuel.—<q rend="inline">Illius aetate (ſays the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, in the cloſe of his manly work) inopia in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilium pulſa videbatur: moeſtitiae locus non erat: querimoniae ſilebant: omnia choreis &amp; cantibus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonabant: ejuſmodi ludis aula regia frequenter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectabatur.

mean his tolerating ſpirit. In the firſt book of his Hiſtory, he ſpeaks of Emanuel's cruel perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Jews in the following generous and exalted language:—<q rend="inline">Fuit quidem hoc nec ex lege nec ex religione factum.

death.—He expired in 1580, happy, ſays De Thou (who celebrates him as a model of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian virtue), that he died juſt before the Spaniſh army entered Portugal, and thus eſcaped being a witneſs to the deſolation of his country.—His va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works were publiſhed at Rome in 1592, by his nephew Oſorius, in four volumes folio, with a Life of their Author. Among theſe are two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable productions: the firſt, an admonition to our Queen Elizabeth, exhorting her to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church of Rome; the ſecond, an Eſſay on Glory, written with ſuch claſſical purity, as to give birth to a report, that it was not the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Oſorius, but the loſt work of Cicero on that ſubject.</p>

                     <p>John Mariana was born 1537, at Talavera (a town in the dioceſe of Toledo), as he himſelf informs us
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0310600102:201"/>
in his famous Eſſay <hi>de Rege,</hi> which opens with a beautiful romantic deſcription of a ſequeſtered ſpot in that neighbourhood, where he enjoyed the pleaſures of literary retirement with his friend Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deron, a Miniſter of Toledo; whoſe death he mentions in the ſame Eſſay, commemorating his learning and his virtues in the moſt pleaſing terms of affectionate admiration.—Mariana was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the order of Jeſuits at the age of 17. He travelled afterwards into Italy and France; and returning into Spain in 1574, ſettled at Toledo, and died there in the 87th year of his age, 1624.—Hearing it frequently regretted, in the courſe of his travels, that there was no General Hiſtory of his country, he engaged in that great work on his return; and publiſhed it in Latin at Toledo, 1592, with a dedication to Philip the IId: where he ſpeaks of his own performance with modeſty and manly freedom, and perhaps with as little flattery as ever appeared in any addreſs of that nature, to a Monarch continually fed with the groſſeſt adulation.—This elaborate work he
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0310600102:202"/>
tranſlated into Spaniſh, but, as he himſelf declares, with all the freedom of an original author. He publiſhed his Verſion in 1601, with an addreſs to Philip the IIId, in which he laments the decline of Learning in his country; and declares he had himſelf executed that work, from his apprehenſion of its being mangled by an ignorant Tranſlator. He had cloſed his Hiſtory (which begins with the firſt peopling of Spain) with the death of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, in 1516; but in a ſubſequent edition, in 1617, he added to it a ſhort ſummary of events to the year 1612. But in the year before he firſt publiſhed the Spaniſh Verſion of his Hiſtory, he addreſſed alſo to the young Monarch Philip the IIId, his famous Eſſay which I have mentioned, and which was publicly burnt at Paris, about 20 years after its publication, on the ſuppoſition that it had excited Ravaillac to the murder of Henry the IVth: though it was aſſerted, with great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, by the Jeſuits, that the Aſſaſſin had never ſeen the book. It is true, indeed, that Mariana in this Eſſay occaſionally defends Clement the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0310600102:203"/>
Monk, who ſtabbed Henry the IIId; and it is very remarkable, that he grounds this defence, not on the bigotted tenets of a Prieſt, who thinks every thing lawful for the intereſt of his church, but on thoſe ſublime principles of civil liberty, with which an antient Roman would have vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the dagger of Brutus. Indeed this Eſſay contains ſome paſſages on Government, which would not have diſhonoured even Cicero himſelf; but, it muſt be owned, they are grievouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced by the laſt chapter of the Work, which breathes a furious ſpirit of eccleſiaſtical intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and yet cloſes with theſe mild and modeſt expreſſions:—<q rend="inline">Noſtrum de regno et Regis inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione judicium fortaſsè non omnibus placeat: qui volet ſequatur; aut ſuo potiùs ſtet, ſi potioribus argumentis nitatur: de quibus rebus tantoperè aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveravi in his libris, eas nunquam veriores quam alienam ſententiam affirmabo. Poteſt enim non ſolum mihi aliud, aliud aliis videri, ſed et mihi ipſi alio tempore. Suam quiſque ſententiam per me ſequatur . . . et . . qui noſtra leget . . .
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0310600102:204"/>
memor conditionis humanae, ſi quid erratum eſt, pio ſtudio rempublicam juvandi veniam benignus concedat et facilis.</q>—This is not the only work of Mariana which fell under a public proſcription; he was himſelf perſecuted, and ſuffered a year's impriſonment, for a treatiſe which ſeems to have been dictated by the pureſt love to his country. It was againſt the pernicious practice of debaſing the public coin; and as it was ſuppoſed to reflect on the Duke of Lerma, called the Sejanus of Spain, it expoſed the Author, about the year 1609, to the perſecution of that vindictive Miniſter, from which it does not appear how he eſcaped.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the accounts of Mariana's life are very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. Bayle, whom I have chiefly followed, mentions a life of him by De Vargas, which he could not procure. I have ſought after this Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher with the ſame ill ſucceſs; as I wiſhed to give a more perfect account of this great Author, whoſe perſonal Hiſtory is little known among us, though it is far from being unworthy of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>Hugo Grotius was the eldeſt child of John de Groot, curator in the univerſity of Leyden, and born at Delft on the 10th of April 1583.—His infancy gave the faireſt promiſe of thoſe great and univerſal talents, which were ſo amply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded in his ſubſequent life. At the age of eleven he was celebrated as a prodigy of learning.—When Barnevelt was ſent Ambaſſador to Henry the IVth of France, in 1598, he took the young Grotius in his train, and preſented him to that Monarch; who honoured the little ſcholar by graciouſly giving him his picture and a chain of gold. One circumſtance was yet wanting to complete the joy of Grotius in this expedition; and he was obliged to quit France without obtaining the great object of his wiſhes, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal acquaintance with the Preſident de Thou.—
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0310600102:206"/>
He afterwards expreſſed his mortification on this ſubject in a letter to that great man, which gave riſe to a friendly correſpondence between theſe congenial characters, highly honourable to both.—On his return to Holland, Grotius devoted himſelf to the practice of the law, and in 1599 pleaded his firſt cauſe at Delft. In the exerciſe of this laborious profeſſion, he found ſufficient time to cultivate polite literature. In 1599 he publiſhed his edition of Martianus Capella, at the requeſt of Scaliger: it was followed, in the ſucceeding year, by the Phaenomena of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus: and in 1601 he printed his firſt tragedy of Adamus Exful, a compoſition which might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly give birth to the divine performance of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; though its author eſteemed it ſo little, as to exclude it from a collection of his poems. Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, indeed, was remarkably modeſt in eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own poetical talents:—few perſons have written ſo many verſes, and thought ſo humbly of their merit.—The public proofs which he had now given of his various erudition, procured
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0310600102:207"/>
him an honour from his country, the more flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering as it was unſolicited. The United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, juſtly proud of having vindicated their liberty againſt the tyranny of Spain, and deſirous of commemorating ſo noble an event, appointed Grotius their Hiſtoriographer. A nomination ſo honourable to a youth, for ſuch he was, led him to collect materials for that Hiſtory; which many accidents conſpired to prevent his publiſhing, during the whole courſe of his buſy and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious life.—From his ſucceſs at the bar, he was promoted to the poſt of Advocate General; and in 1608 he married Maria Reigeſberg, a lady of a reſpectable family in Zealand, and a wife, as his Biographer obſerves, truly worthy of ſuch a huſband. In 1613 he became Penſionary of Rotterdam, an office which gave him a ſeat in the Aſſembly of the States. He was ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards employed in a commiſſion to England, to ſettle ſome national diſputes concerning the Greenland Fiſhery.—The greateſt pleaſure and advantage which he derived from this expedition,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0310600102:208"/>
was the intimacy which he contracted in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with the celebrated Caſaubon. Soon after his return to Holland, the fatal ſpirit of religious controverſy produced thoſe unfortunate and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known diſtractions in his country, which led to the infamous execution of the great and virtuous Barnevelt. Grotius, who was affectionately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to that upright Miniſter, and joined with him in every meaſure to counteract the uſurping ambition of Prince Maurice, was thus expoſed to the oppreſſion of that vindictive hero.—After the vain ceremony of an iniquitous trial, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetual impriſonment; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, on the 6th of June 1619, to the fortreſs of Louveſtein, in South Holland, at the point of the iſland formed by the Vahal and the Meuſe.—His tender and faithful wife, who had been cruelly debarred from attending him, even in ſickneſs, during his confinement at the Hague, was now admitted to ſhare his priſon; on the hard condition of forfeiting that privilege, if ſhe ever ventured from Louveſtein: ſhe afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0310600102:209"/>
leave to come abroad twice a week.—With the ſpirit of a Roman Matron ſhe refuſed the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance which the government had aſſigned for the maintenance of her huſband—continued for almoſt two years the conſtant attendant on his captivity—and at length became the glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his deliverance. Grotius, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily experienced that love and literature are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing reſources under the moſt galling calamity of human life, had purſued his ſtudies in priſon with his uſual ardour. He compoſed there, among other works, the firſt ſketch of his Eſſay on the Truth of Chriſtianity, in a poetical form, and in his native language.—Reports were ſpread by his enemies that he had formed a plan for his eſcape, and his priſon was rigorouſly examined. But notwithſtanding the vigilance of his oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, the affectionate ingenuity of his wife reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to freedom by the following expedient:—He had been allowed to borrow books from his friends; and it was uſual with him to ſend ſuch as he had read in a cheſt, that went regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0310600102:210"/>
with his linen to the neighbouring town of Gorcum. The guards were at firſt very ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in their examination of this cheſt; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long found in it only books and linen, they were now accuſtomed to let it paſs unopened.—The circumſtance ſuggeſted to the attentive wife of Grotius the poſſibility of her huſband's eſcape, and ſhe perſuaded him to attempt it by this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular conveyance. The incidents attending the adventure were highly calculated to increaſe the agitation of her heart; and muſt indeed have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the failure of her deſign, had ſhe not taken the moſt ingenious precautions to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure its ſucceſs:—The ſoldiers, who carried the cheſt in which Grotius was incloſed, were alarmed by its weight; and cried out, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial language of their country, that it muſt contain an Arminian;—ſhe replied with great preſence of mind, that it was indeed loaded with Arminian books. The ſoldiers were ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, and went to the wife of their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officer, who was abſent, to expreſs their ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0310600102:211"/>
—ſhe replied, that ſhe had been aſſured it contained only books, and bade them carry it to the boat: a female ſervant in the ſecret attended the cheſt, and ſaw it ſafely conveyed to the houſe of Dazelaer, a friend of Grotius, in Gorcum, from whence he paſſed in diſguiſe into Brabant. The generous contriver of his eſcape now tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed in the ſucceſs of her project. Being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that her huſband was ſafe, by the return of her ſervant, ſhe avowed what ſhe had done, and was more cloſely confined by the offended com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant of Louveſtein. But ſhe ſoon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her liberty, on preſenting a petition to the States-General; though ſome wretches were found in that aſſembly, brutal enough to expreſs a deſire of puniſhing a woman for an act of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm, which, in Athens or in Rome, would have almoſt rendered her an object of idolatry.—Her merit, however, has been juſtly celebrated by the poets of her country; but the moſt pleaſing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of it appears in a poem of Grotius, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the unfortunate ſon of the Preſident De

                        </q> It was not without reaſon that Grotius la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, in the cloſe of this paſſage, his continued adverſity. Few literary characters have been ſo repeatedly expoſed to all the various and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anxieties of public life.—After his eſcape from priſon in 1621, he took refuge in France. He received, indeed, the moſt flattering marks of regard from many eminent characters of that kingdom, and a penſion of three thouſand livres from Lewis the XIIIth; but the payment of this gratuity, ſo honourable to the Monarch who beſtowed it, was ſoon rendered irregular and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious by the artifices of Richelieu; and Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0310600102:216"/>
was at length obliged to ſeek a more inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent aſylum, merely becauſe he was of too firm and noble a character to become the ſervile inſtrument of that imperious miniſter.—He had paſſed however ten years, and compoſed one of his moſt celebrated works in that country—his Treatiſe de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis was begun in 1623 at Balagui, a ſeat of the Preſident De Meme, in the neighbourhood of Senlis, and he publiſhed it at Paris in 1625. The great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive reputation which his writings had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, did not induce Holland to atone for the injuſtice which ſhe had exerciſed againſt one of the moſt eminent and virtuous of her citizens. The death of his enemy Prince Maurice had tempted Grotius to hope, that he might return with ſafety and honour to his native country; but on making the experiment in 1631, he met with much more ingratitude than he expected, and retired in the next year to Hamburgh—he there contracted an intimacy with Salvius, the Vice-Chancellor of Sweden, who ſent a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0310600102:217"/>
account of his new friend to Oxenſtiern, the great miniſter, who ſo well ſupplied the loſs of his heroic maſter Guſtavus. Grotius was ſoon invited to Franckfort by that penetrating genius, who introduced him into the council of the young Chriſtina, and appointed him her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to the court of France:—it is ſaid, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that Grotius owed his connection with Sweden to the high ſentiments which Guſtavus himſelf had entertained of his merit, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders given by that Monarch for the employment of the celebrated exile, whoſe Treatiſe de Jure Belli was found in his tent after the fatal victory of Lutzen, which he purchaſed with his life. However this may be, Grotius appeared at Paris in the character of Ambaſſador from Sweden 1635, and continued no leſs than ten years in a ſituation equally ſplendid and vexatious—en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the delicate buſineſs of negotiating ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies, which were paid with reluctance; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed by the hoſtile intrigues of his ungrateful
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0310600102:218"/>
country, and alternately inſulted and flattered by the miniſters of France, he maintained himſelf with integrity and honour in a difficult and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſtation, from which his various and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful enemies were perpetually endeavouring to effect his removal.—After a ſeries of public mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, he at length ſolicited his own recall. He obtained a paſſport through Holland, was treated with great honour at Amſterdam, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at Stockholm was flattered with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes by the Queen Chriſtina, who preſſed him to ſettle with his family in Sweden. From this however he excuſed himſelf, and pleaded the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der health of his wife as unequal to ſo cold a climate. Having obtained, after ſome delays, the Queen's permiſſion to retire, and a veſſel to carry him to Lubeck, he was unfortunately ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecked on the coaſt of Pomerania, from whence he travelled ſixty miles in an open waggon, to the town of Roſtock, where, after languiſhing a few days, he expired on the 19th of Auguſt 1645.—
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0310600102:219"/>
For my very imperfect account of this great and amiable man, I am chiefly indebted to Mr. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigny, whoſe life of Grotius deſerves a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed rank among biographical writings, as it contains a very luminous diſplay of much intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate matter, and a juſt delineation of a character which deſerves to be minutely ſtudied: for what nation can produce a more ſingular and excelling compound of ſcience and virtue, of genius and piety?—As an Hiſtorian, he ſhares with Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides the uncommon merit of celebrating the ſplendid actions of his perſonal enemies, and of a country which treated him with the moſt unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ingratitude. It appears from one of his letters to De Thou, that he had made ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in the plan at leaſt of his Hiſtory, at ſo early a period as 1614; for, after complimenting the great Hiſtorian of France on his immortal work, he adds, <q rend="inline">Ego quoque impar ſanè oneri, ſed magno patriae amore accenſus, ſimile opus molior; tantò autem minus tuo, quantò minor eſt Batavia, non dicam Galliâ veſtrâ, ſed toto orbe.

Sed nec adhuc Varo videor neque dicere Cinna digna: prematur itaque immaturus labor donec aetas cum judicio tempus quoque emendandi dederit; aut potiùs exurgat alius, qui res ſcitu per ſe non indignas dictione commendet, ut eo liben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiùs diſcant poſteri quid Batavi fecerint.</q>—We learn alſo from a letter to his brother, in 1637, that the work was then finiſhed, and that he thought proper to delay its publication. Though it ſeems to have been his favourite performance, he had never the ſatisfaction of ſeeing it in print:—it did not appear till twelve years after his death, when his ſons Cornelius and Peter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed it to the States of Holland and Weſt Frieſland, in a Dedication that does honour both to their father and themſelves.—The work it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, under the double name of Annals and Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, gives a complete account of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting period, from the year 1566 to the truce with Spain in 1609.—The Letters of Grotius are not leſs valuable than his Hiſtory, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain much miſcellaneous intelligence, and abound
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0310600102:221"/>
with literary anecdotes.—His amiable wife ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived him, and died at the Hague.—Of their ſix children, Peter became the moſt eminent—he was ſent by his country as her Ambaſſador to France; and ſeems to have inherited both the talents and the virtues of his father.—It may yet be proper to add to this long Note the noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium of Grotius on Scaliger, to which I have alluded, and which, as Dr. Johnſon obſerves, ſeems to have been imitated by Cowley, in the cloſe of his Elegy on Sir Henry Wooton.<q>

                     <p>James Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus De Thou was the youngeſt ſon of Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher De Thou, Firſt Preſident of the Parliament of Paris, and born in that city 1553. His own Memoirs give a pleaſing account of the early activity of his mind.—As his health, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his childhood, was ſo tender and infirm, that his parents rather reſtrained him from the uſual ſtudies of his age, he devoted much of his time to drawing, and copied with a pen the engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0310600102:223"/>
of Albert Durer, before he was ten years old. At that age, he was ſettled in the college of Burgundy; but this plan of his education was ſoon interrupted by a fever, in which his life was deſpaired of, and in which the mother of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture friend, the Duke of Montpenſier, watched him with an attention ſingularly happy, after his phyſicians and his parents had conſidered him as dead. In a few years after his recovery, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to Orleans to ſtudy the civil law; from thence he was drawn to Valence in Dauphiny, by the reputation of Cujacius, who was then reading lectures there: on his road he embraced an opportunity of hearing Hotoman, the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated author of Franco-Gallia, who was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lectures alſo at Bourges.—During his reſidence at Valence, he contracted a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Joſeph Scaliger, which he cultivated through life.—In 1572, his father recalled him to Paris, juſt before the maſſacre of St. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew.—He mentions in his Memoirs the horrors which he felt in ſeeing a very ſmall part
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0310600102:224"/>
of that bloody ſcene.—He reſided in the houſe of his uncle Nicholas De Thou, promoted to the biſhopric of Chartres: he was then deſigned himſelf for the church; and, beginning to collect his celebrated library, applied himſelf particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Civil Law, and to Grecian litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>He travelled into Italy in 1573, with Paul De Foix, going on an embaſſy to the Pope and the Italian Princes. Of De Foix he gives the moſt engaging character, and ſpeaks with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the literary entertainment and advantages which he derived from this expedition. He return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Paris, and devoted himſelf again to his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in the following year.—On the diſſentions in the court of France, in 1576, he was employed to negociate with the Mareſchal Montmorency, and engage him to interpoſe his good offices to prevent the civil war; which he for ſome time ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.—The ſame year he viſited the Low Countries, and on his return was appointed to a public office; on which he entered with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0310600102:225"/>
diffidence which is ſo natural to a delicate mind.</p>
                     <p>In 1579 he travelled again with his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was ſent by his phyſicians to the baths of Plombieres in Lorrain: from hence he made a ſhort excurſion into Germany, and was received there with the jovial hoſpitality of that country, which he deſcribes in a very lively manner.—But affection ſoon recalled him to Plombieres, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his infirm brother to Paris, who died there in a few months after their return.</p>
                     <p>In 1580, on the plague's appearing in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, our Hiſtorian retired into Touraine; and after viſiting the principal places in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, returned to Paris in the winter. In the following year, he was of the number choſen from the Parliament of Paris to adminiſter juſtice in Guienne, as two eccleſiaſtics were included in that commiſſion.—In this expedition he embraced every opportunity of preparing the materials of his Hiſtory; ſeeking, as he ever did, the ſociety of all perſons eminent for their talents, or capable of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0310600102:226"/>
him any uſeful information. He ſpeaks with great pleaſure of a viſit which he paid at this time to the celebrated Montaigne, whom he calls a man of a moſt liberal mind, and totally uninfected with the ſpirit of party.—After various excurſions he was now returning to Paris, when he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the unexpected news of his father's death; an event which affected him moſt deeply, as filial affection was one of the ſtriking characteriſtics of his amiable mind. He conſoled himſelf under the affliction of having been unable to pay his duty to his dying parent, by erecting a magnificent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to his memory, expreſſive of the high ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in which he ever held his virtues.—He engaged again in public buſineſs, devoting his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of leiſure to mathematical ſtudies, and to the compoſition of Latin verſe, which ſeems to have been his favourite amuſement.—In 1584 he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his Poem, De Re Accipitraria; which, tho' much celebrated by the critics of his age, has fallen, like the ſubject of which it treats, into univerſal neglect.—In 1585 he bid adieu to the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0310600102:227"/>
Court, on finding himſelf treated with ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of coldneſs, as his ingenuous nature could not ſubmit to; and being eager to advance in his great work, which he had already brought down to the reign of Francis II.—In 1587, having been often preſſed to marry by his family, and being abſolved from his eccleſiaſtical engagements for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he made choice of Marie Barbanſon, of an antient and noble family; but as her parents were ſuſpected of a ſecret inclination to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion, it was thought proper that the lady ſhould undergo a kind of expiation, in a private conference with two Catholic Divines; a circumſtance of which the great Hiſtorian ſpeaks with an air of triumph in his Memoirs, as a proof of his own inviolable attachment to the faith of his fathers. In 1588 he loſt his affectionate mother; who is deſcribed, by her ſon, as meeting death with the ſame gentleneſs and tranquillity of mind, by which her life was diſtinguiſhed.—When the violence of the League had reduced Henry the IIId to abandon Paris, our Hiſtorian was ſent into Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0310600102:228"/>
to confirm the magiſtrates of that province in their adherence to the King. He afterwards met Henry at Blois; and while he was receiving from him in private ſome commiſſions to execute at Paris, the King preſſed his hand, and ſeemed preparing to impart to him ſome important ſecret; but after a long pauſe diſmiſſed him without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing it. This ſecret was afterwards ſuppoſed to have been the projected aſſaſſination of the Duke of Guiſe: the ſuppoſition is probable; and it is alſo probable that if Henry had then revealed his deſign, the manly virtue and eloquence of De Thou might have led him to relinquiſh that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and fatal meaſure.—He was, however, ſo far from ſuſpecting the intended crime of the King, that when he firſt heard at Paris that Guiſe was aſſaſſinated, he believed it a falſe rumour, only ſpread by that faction to introduce, what he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed had really happened, the murder of the King.—In the commotions which the death of Guiſe produced in Paris, many inſults were offered to the family of De Thou: his wife was impriſoned
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0310600102:229"/>
for a day in the Baſtile; but obtaining her liberty, ſhe eſcaped from the city in a mean habit, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by her huſband, diſguiſed alſo in the dreſs of a ſoldier.—Having ſent his wife in ſafety into Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy, he repaired to the King, who was almoſt deſerted, at Blois; and was greatly inſtrumental in perſuading his maſter to his coalition with Henry of Navarre.—The King determined to eſtabliſh a Parliament at Tours, and De Thou was conſidered as the moſt proper perſon to be the Preſident of this aſſembly; but with his uſual modeſty he declined this honour, and choſe rather to engage with his friend Mr. de Schomberg, in an expedition to Germany for the ſervice of the King.—He was at firſt deſigned for the embaſſy to Elizabeth; but at the requeſt of Schomberg declined the appointment, and accompanied his friend.</p>
                     <p>He firſt received intelligence of the King's death at Venice, where he had formed an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the celebrated Arnauld d'Oſſat, at that time Secretary to the Cardinal Joyeuſe.—In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0310600102:230"/>
of their converſation on this event, and the calamities of France, De Thou addreſſed a Latin Poem to his friend, which he afterwards printed at Tours.</p>
                     <p>In leaving Italy, he paſſed a few days at Padua with his friend Vicenzio Pinelli; from whom he collected many particulars concerning the moſt eminent Italian and Spaniſh Authors, whom he determined to celebrate in his Hiſtory; in the hope, as he honeſtly confeſſes, that his liberal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to foreign merit might entitle his own Works to the favour both of Italy and Spain. But he was diſappointed in this fair expectation, and laments the ingratitude which he experienced from both.</p>
                     <p>On his return to France, he was graciouſly received by Henry the IVth; and in giving that Prince an account of Italy, ſuggeſted to him the idea of a connection with Mary of Medicis. After the battle of Ivry, he complimented the King in a ſhort Poem, which cloſes with the following lines:<q>
                           <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0310600102:231"/>
                           <l>Auſpiciis vulgò peraguntur praelia regum,</l>
                           <l>Perque duces illis gloria multa venit:</l>
                           <l>Tu vincis virtute tua, nec militis haec eſt;</l>
                           <l>Iſta tibi propriâ laurea parta manu.</l>
                        </q> As he was travelling, ſoon afterwards, with his wife and family, which he deſigned to ſettle at Tours, his party was intercepted by the enemy, and he was obliged to abandon his wife and her attendants; being prevailed on by their entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſecure his own eſcape by the ſwiftneſs of his horſe.—He repaired to the King at Giſors, and ſoon obtained the reſtitution of his family.—On the death of Amyot, Biſhop of Auxerre, well known by his various Tranſlations from the Greek language, the King appointed De Thou his Principal Librarian. In 1592, our Hiſtorian was very near falling a victim to the plague; but happily ſtruggled through that dangerous diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, by the aſſiſtance of two ſkilful phyſicians, who attended him at Tours.—In 1593, he began the moſt important part of his Hiſtory; and under this year he introduces in his Memoirs a long and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0310600102:232"/>
Poem, addreſſed to Poſterity; in which he enters into a juſtification of himſelf againſt the malignant attacks which the manly and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous freedom of his writings had drawn upon him. It concludes with the following animated appeal to the ſpirit of his father:<q>
                           <l>Vos, O majorum Cineres, teque optime longis</l>
                           <l>Soliciti genitor defuncte laboribus aevi,</l>
                           <l>Teſtor, pro patria nullas regnique ſalute</l>
                           <l>Vitaviſſe vices; veſtra virtute meaque</l>
                           <l>Indignum nil feciſſe; et ſi fata tuliſſent,</l>
                           <l>Prodeſſem ut patriae, patriae ſuccurrere, livor</l>
                           <l>Abſiſtat, pietate mea meruiſſe petenti.</l>
                           <l>Pura ad vos anima atque hodiernae neſcia culpae</l>
                           <l>Deſcendam; quandòque noviſſima venerit hora,</l>
                           <l>Noſtraque ſub tacitos ibit fama integra manes.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In 1594 he ſucceeded his uncle Auguſtin, as Preſident a Mortier.—In 1596 he loſt his valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and learned friend Pithou, who firſt ſolicited him to undertake his Hiſtory, and had greatly
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0310600102:233"/>
aſſiſted him in the proſecution of that laborious work. How deeply the affectionate mind of De Thou was wounded by this event, appears from his long letter to Caſaubon on the occaſion.—In 1597 he began to be engaged in thoſe negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which happily terminated in the famous edict of Nantes.—It may be proper to obſerve here, that De Thou was accuſed of being a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt, in conſequence of the part he acted in this buſineſs, as well as from the moderate tenor of his Hiſtory; and it is remarkable, that Sully ſeems in his Memoirs to countenance the accuſation.</p>
                     <p>In 1601 our Hiſtorian ſuffered a ſevere do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic affliction in the loſs of his wife. He cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated her virtues, and his own connubial affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a Latin Poem: with this, and a Greek epitaph on the ſame lady, written by Caſaubon, he terminates the Commentary of his own Life, of which the preceding account is an imperfect abridgment.—His firſt wife leaving him no children, he married, in 1603, Gaſparde de la Chaſtre, an accompliſhed lady of a noble family;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0310600102:234"/>
who having brought him three ſons and three daughters, died at the age of 39, 1616.—There is a fine letter of Daniel Heinſius addreſſed to our author on this occaſion, exhorting him to fortitude: but this unexpected domeſtic calamity, and the miſeries which befel his country on the murder of Henry the Great, are ſaid to have wounded his feeling mind ſo deeply, as to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion his death, which happened in May 1617.—Under the regency of Mary of Medicis, he had been one of the Directors General of the finances; maintaining the ſame reputation for integrity in that department, which he had ever preſerved in his judicial capacity.</p>
                     <p>The firſt part of his Hiſtory appeared in 1604, with a Preface addreſſed to Henry IV. juſtly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated for its liberal and manly ſpirit. But I muſt obſerve, that the following compliment to the King—<q rend="inline">Quicquid de ea ſtatueris juſſeriſve, pro divinae vocis oraeulo mihi erit</q>—was more than even that moſt amiable of Monarchs deſerved; as he ungratefully deſerted the cauſe of our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0310600102:235"/>
in ſuffering his Work to be proſcribed by the public cenſure of Rome, in 1609; as De Thou plainly intimates in the following paſſage from one of his letters, written in 1611:—<q rend="inline">Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licata prima parte [Hiſtoriae meae], immanè quam commoti ſunt plerique, ſive invidi, ſive factioſi, qui mox proceres quoſdam, qui per ſe in talibus rebus nihil vident, per calumnias artificiosè con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fictas, ut ſcis, in me concitaverunt, remque e veſtigio Roman detulerunt; et auctore malignè exagitato, facilè pervicerunt, ut moroſi illi cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores omnia mea ſiniſtrè interpretarentur; et, praejudicio perſonae, opus integrum, cujus ne tertiam quidem partem legerant, praecipitato ordine damnarent. Rex cauſam meam initio quidem tuebatur, quamdiu proceres in aula in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtos habui. Sed paulatim ipſe eorundem aſtu infractus eſt; cognitoque Romae per emiſſarios labare regem, poſt Oſſati et Serafini, Cardina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium mihi amiciſſimorum, obitum, et illuſtriſſimi Perronii ex urbe diſceſſum, ictus poſtremò in me directus eſt; qui facilè vitari potuit, ſi qui circa

regem erant, tantae injuriae ſenſum ad ſe ac regni dignitatem pertinere vel minima ſignificatione prae ſe tuliſſent. Ita in aula omni ope deſtitutus, facilè Romae oppreſſus ſum.</q>—De Thou was preparing a new edition of his Hiſtory at the time of his death.—His paſſion for Latin verſe appears never to have forſaken him; as the lateſt effuſion of his pen was a little poem deſcriptive of his laſt illneſs, and an epitaph, in which he draws the following juſt character of himſelf:<q>
                           <l>Mihi veritatis cura vitae commodis</l>
                           <l>Antiquiorque charitatibus fuit;</l>
                           <l>Nullique facto, voce nulli injurius,</l>
                           <l>Injurias patienter aliorum tuli.</l>
                           <l>Tu quiſquis es, qualiſque, quantuſque, O bone,</l>
                           <l>Si cura veri eſt ulla, ſi pietas movet,</l>
                           <l>A me meiſque injuriam, quaeſo, abſtine.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The pious paternal prayer in the laſt line was very far from being crowned with ſucceſs. Francis, the eldeſt ſon of De Thou, fell a victim

to the reſentment which Cardinal Richelieu is ſaid to have conceived againſt him, from a paſſage in the great Hiſtorian reflecting on the Richelieu family. He was beheaded at Lyons, 1642, for having been privy to a conſpiracy againſt the Cardinal.—Voltaire, with his uſual philanthropy and ſpirit, inveighs againſt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of this execution, in his Melanges, tom. iii.—The curious reader may find a particular account of this tragical event in the laſt volume of that noble edition of Thuanus, which was publiſhed under the auſpices of Dr. Mead, and does great honour to our country.—I ſhall cloſe this Note by tranſcribing from it the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſpirited epitaph on the unfortunate vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim:<q>

                     <p>The origin of the French nation was aſcribed by one of the Monkiſh Hiſtorians to Francio, a ſon of Priam: Mr. Warton, who mentions this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in his Diſſertation on the origin of roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic fiction in Europe, ſuppoſes that the revival of Virgil's Aeneid, about the ſixth or ſeventh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, inſpired many nations with this chimerical idea of tracing their deſcent from the family of Priam. There is a very remarkable proof in the Hiſtorian Matthew of Weſtminſter, how fond the Engliſh were of conſidering themſelves as the deſcendants of the Trojan Brutus. In a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Edward the Firſt to Pope Boniface, concerning the affairs of Scotland, the King boaſts of his Trojan predeceſſor in the following terms:—<q rend="inline">Sub temporibus itaque Ely &amp; Samuelis prophetarum, vir quidam ſtrenuus et inſignis,

                     <p>I wiſh not to dwell invidiouſly on the failings of this immortal Genius; but it may be uſeful to remark, that no Hiſtorical work, though executed by a man of the higheſt mental abilities, can obtain a laſting reputation, if it be planned and written with a ſervility of ſpirit.—This was evidently the caſe in Bacon's Hiſtory of Henry the VIIth.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0310600102:247"/>
It was the firſt work he engaged in after his diſgrace, and laid as a peace-offering at the feet of his maſter, the deſpicable James; who affected to conſider his great grandfather, the abject and avaricious Henry, as the model of a King. It was therefore the aim of the unfortunate Hiſtorian to flatter this phantaſy of the royal pedant, for whom he wrote; and he accordingly formed a coloſſal ſtatue to repreſent a pigmy.—It is matter of aſtoniſhment that Lord Bolingbroke, who in his political works has written on the vices of this very King, with a force and beauty ſo ſuperior to the Hiſtory in queſtion, ſhould ſpeak of it as a work poſſeſſing merit ſufficient to bear a compariſon with the ancients. On the contrary, the extreme awkwardneſs of the taſk which the Hiſtorian impoſed upon himſelf, gave a weakneſs and embarraſſment to his ſtyle, which in his nobler works is clear, nervous, and manly. This will particularly appear from a few lines in his character of Henry:—<q rend="inline">"This King, to ſpeak of him in terms equal to his deſerving, was
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0310600102:248"/>
one of the beſt ſort of wonders, a wonder for wiſe men. He had parts, both in his virtues and his fortune, not ſo fit for a common-place as for obſervation . . . . His worth may bear a tale or two, that may put upon him ſomewhat that may ſeem divine."</q>—He then relates a dream of Henry's mother, the Lady Margaret: but the quotations I have made may be ſufficient to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my remark; and, as Dr. Johnſon ſays hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily of Milton, <q rend="inline">"What Engliſhman can take delight in tranſcribing paſſages, which, if they leſſen the reputation of Bacon, diminiſh in ſome degree the honour of our country?"</q>

                     <p>The Critics are much divided on this paſſage. I have followed an interpretation very different from that adopted by a learned and judicious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0310600102:250"/>
who has lately entered into a thorough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of all the anecdotes relating to this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Conqueror, in a very elaborate and ſpirited diſſertation, intitled, "Examen critique des Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriens d'Alexandre." Paris, 4to, 1775. But there is great probability in his conjecture, that the name of Ariſtobulus has ſlipt into the ſtory by ſome miſtake; and that the ſycophant ſo juſtly reprimanded was Oneſicritus, who attended the Hero of Macedon in quality of Hiſtoriographer, and is cenſured by the judicious Strabo, as the moſt fabulous of all the Writers who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in his Hiſtory.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0310600102:251"/>
Indeed Dedications in general are but too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a diſgrace to letters.—Perhaps a conciſe Hiſtory of this ſpecies of writing, and the fate of ſome remarkable Dedicators, might have a good influence towards correcting that proſtitution of talents, which is ſo often obſerved in productions of this nature: and ſuch a work might be very amuſing to the lovers of literary anecdote.—The two moſt unfortunate Dedications that occur to my remembrance, were written by Joſhua Barnes, and Dr. Pearce, late Biſhop of Rocheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: The firſt dedicated his Hiſtory of Edward the IIId to James the IId, and unluckily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared that Monarch to the moſt valiant of his predeceſſors, juſt before his timidity led him to abdicate the throne: the ſecond dedicated his edition of Tully de Oratore to Lord Macclesfield, and as unluckily celebrated his patron as a model of public virtue, not many years before he was impeached in parliament, and fined £.30,000, for the iniquity of his conduct in the office of Chancellor.</p>

                        <q rend="inline">"Nothing could have ſunk this Author in obſcurity, but the remoteneſs and barbarity of the people whoſe ſtory he relates. It ſeldom happens, that all circumſtances concur to happineſs or

fame. The nation which produced this great Hiſtorian, has the grief of ſeeing his genius em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon a foreign and unintereſting ſubject; and that Writer, who might have ſecured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity to his name by a Hiſtory of his own country, has expoſed himſelf to the danger of oblivion, by recounting enterprizes and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of which none deſire to be informed."</q>

                     <p>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Brady, born in Norfolk, was Profeſſor of Phyſic in the Univerſity of Cambridge, which he repreſented in Parliament.—He was Maſter of Caius College, and Phyſician in Ordinary to James II. He publiſhed, in 1684, a Hiſtory of England, from the invaſion of Julius Caeſar to the death of Richard the Second, in three volumes folio: and died in 1700.—His character cannot

be more juſtly or more forcibly expreſſed, than in the words of a living Author, who has lately vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the antient conſtitution of our country with great depth of learning, and with all the energy of genius inſpirited by freedom.</p>

I ſhall cloſe them with a liſt of modern treatiſes on the compoſition of Hiſtory.—The earlieſt work of this kind, which has fallen under my obſervation, is the Methodus ad facilem Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriarum Cognitionem, publiſhed at Paris, in 1566, by Jean Bodin, a lawyer of eminence; from whom Monteſquieu is ſuppoſed to have borrowed his fanciful and fallacious ſyſtem on the Influence of Climate.—Italy, the parent of many great Hiſtorians, produced alſo, about the ſame period, an elegant Latin diſſertation, De Scriben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da Hiſtoria. The author, John Antony Vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rani, was Biſhop of Giovenazzo in 1588, and died 1610.—A Spaniſh eſſay, on the ſame ſubject, was printed in 1611, by Luis Cabrera de Cordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Feyjoo, whoſe entertaining Eſſays on Hiſtory were tranſlated into Engliſh in 1779.—Holland produced, in 1623, the Ars Hiſtorica of Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, and ſoon afterwards his more voluminous and valuable work on the Greek and Roman Hiſtorians.—The French language, ſo fertile in miſcellaneous criticiſm, affords us many works that relate to Hiſtorical compoſition: the moſt extraordinary of theſe, is a very late publication by the Abbé Mably, "De la Maniere d'ecrire l' Hiſtoire." As this inſolent and dogmatical Author has groſsly inſulted our country, by vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our moſt eminent writers of Hiſtory, I had thoughts of chaſtiſing his preſumption by a full diſplay of his various abſurdities; but as this unpleaſant office has been in ſome meaſure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by one of his own countrymen, under the title of a Supplement to his Work, I ſhall only make a few remarks on the illiberal terms in which he ſpeaks of my friend Mr. Gibbon.</p>

                        <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0310600102:262"/>
As the Abbé had only read a tranſlated extract from the accompliſhed Hiſtorian, he certainly could not be a competent judge of the ſpirit and beauty of his immortal work. No matter: he had a private pique againſt the Author, and was therefore determined to decry his compoſition. In the blindneſs and precipitancy that uſually belong to baſe anger, he attributes the defect of dullneſs to a Book, more univerſally read than any modern performance of equal magnitude.</p>
                     <p>The Abbé talks loudly of the literary virtues that become an Hiſtorian: but he ſeems to have forgot that there are literary vices, which may render even a learned and ingenious critic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. No productions of the preſs are more diſgraceful to literature, than thoſe in which a diſſertation on any art is made the vehicle of perſonal malignity: yet, as this is the moſt plauſible and inſinuating method of giving vent to malice, it is, perhaps, the moſt common. In the end, however, this ſpecies of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0310600102:263"/>
literary ſlander defeats its own purpoſe; for, if the envious are pleaſed to echo it for a time, to more candid and generous readers it endears the merit it traduces. They lament the hard deſtiny of ſuperior talents; and recollect, with a ſigh of affectionate indignation, the juſt and ſpirited remark of Monſieur D' Alembert, <q rend="inline">"Que les grands Genies ſont toujours de chirés par des gens, qui ne ſont pas dignes de les lire!"</q>
