            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following collection of Caſes is the practical part of a conſiderable work written on glandular affections in general; in which their cauſes will be explained, and a new theory drawn from the lateſt anatomical diſcoveries in the lymphatic ſyſtem. As numbers are daily ſuffering under theſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaging complaints; humanity dictated to me the neceſſity of the preſent publication, and it is hoped this attempt to alleviate human miſery, will be received with candor.</p>
            <p>THE names of the generality of patients have not been introduced; but ſeveral of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction may be referred to, ſhould it be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed neceſſary.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE uncertainty of curing ulcerated legs by reſt, ſalivation, &amp;c. and the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes of patients diſcharged from hoſpitals, induced me, near twenty years ago, to ſearch for remedies more adequate to the nature of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. The cauſe of ulcers I conceived to be owing to ſome ſcorbutic or other taint in the habit; in which the lymphatic ſyſtem was principally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; an internal alterative treatment was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted, ſucceſs in many inſtances was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the improvements were made public in the year 1767<note n="*" place="bottom">A Treatiſe on the method of curing ulcerated legs without reſt, proved by a variety of Caſes.</note> The doctrines<note n="†" place="bottom">See Sharp's Surgery.</note> that <q>old ulcers were difficult of cure; that it would be dangerous to attempt the healing them, as it might endanger the patient's life, or produce a diarrhoea, fever, or aſthma,</q> were refuted by undeniable facts.</p>
            <p>The ſeat of the ulcer is commonly in the adipoſe membrane, which is ſometimes thickened and very frequently callous. I diſcovered in the cure, that theſe hardened parts became ſoft and pliant; and from hence ſome hopes were entertained that a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar practice might remove glandular complaints. A trial proved the conjecture not ill founded; for a conſiderable number of indurated breaſts, which an extenſive employment in midwifery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, were in general cured by gentle alteratives. Numbers of patients in diſorders of this nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves, as advice and remedies were given for many years without any gratuity. Afterwards an hoſpital was opened, to which the poor might daily
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0059501400:5"/>apply, with no other recommendations than diſtreſs and ſickneſs. There were ſeldom leſs than four or five hundred patients under cure in diſeaſes of the eyes, ſchrophulous, cancerous, ulcerous and other indiſpoſitions The experience obtained from this great variety of caſes, enabled me to comprehend a more beneficial treatment than the common, which was acknowledged defective, by that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſurgeon, the late Mr. Samuel Sharp. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements were gradually made from a more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute knowledge of the complaints, and ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affections formerly thought incurable, were conquered by the gentleſt means. The diſorders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the breaſts, after delivery, could in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral be prevented chiefly by a partial abſtinence from liquids; or, if tumors or inflammation hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, remedies more efficacious than ſhaking the breaſts, embrocations of oil, brandy, and vinegar, plaiſters of diachilon, or treacle on brown paper, &amp;c. could be adminiſtered with a certainty of advantage in every caſe. A treatiſe has been written on theſe ſubjects, and the curative intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fully explained.<note n="*" place="bottom">A treatiſe on the diſeaſes of the breaſts, and methods of managing women during childbed, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note> The confidence of ſeveral perſons of rank, the public protection, and the pleaſure which reiterated ſucceſs produced, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited freſh ardor in the purſuit of new enquiries.</p>
            <p>The uſual methods of managing diſtempers of the eyes ſeemed to be exceedingly defective, and in many inſtances cruel. Theſe ſubjects next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my attention; the ancient and modern treatment was examined, and in a publication cenſured, or praiſed, in proportion as it experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally appeared to have had merits or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects<note n="†" place="bottom">A Treatiſe on the ancient and modern methods of curing diſeaſes of the Eyes, with new improvements.</note>. External applications to the eyes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0059501400:6"/>poultices, were in general condemned, with the reaſons aſſigned; the inflammatory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions were reduced under four heads;<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Ives makes a number of uſeleſs diſtinctions.</note> new methods of cure were recommended, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by proofs of perſons relieved. The manner of extracting the cataract was ſucceſsfully improved, and many patients were reſtored to ſight.</p>
            <p>To demonſtrate that it is on facts alone that theſe aſſertions are made, the following collection of caſes now make their appearance as an addition to the former<note n="†" place="bottom">Upwards of ſixty caſes have already been publiſhed in the treatiſes.</note>; in order to extend and confirm the utility of the improvements, and render them more beneficially uſeful to ſociety.</p>
            <p>The principal remedies uſed in the cures were,

               </list>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0059501400:7"/>The Aethiops mineralis ſhould be prepared by rubbing a conſiderable time without any heat.</p>
            <p>The aquila alba is the calomel ten or twelve times ſublimed, by which its purgative and draſtic qualities are deſtroyed; a quarter, or half a grain joined with an equal quantity of ſulphur antimonii precipitatum, when well rubbed for a long time together, and formed into a pill, with confectio damocrat. is called Pilula rubra.</p>
            <p>The nitre ſhould be rendered perfectly pure, by fuſing in a crucible, and rechriſtalliſation. When mixed with equal parts of aethiops min. and a ſmall portion of cinnabar antimon. by a long tritura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the compoſition is called Pulvis mineralis.</p>
            <p>Camphorated julap has been often preſcribed, with the other remedies, as a reſolvent and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector.</p>
            <p>The aquila alba, is given in the doſe of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or half a grain, formed into a pill, with ſugar, and a mucilage of gum arabic; this is named pilula alba.</p>
            <p>The calx antimonii, and the aethiops antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialis, are given in general to perſons who have a dry ſkin.</p>
            <p>The ſpiritus ſalis ammoniaci is ſometimes added to the ſolutions of ſimple nitre, and is called miſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra nitroſa volatilis. The aether nitri is given to patients exceedingly nervous, or who have hectical ſymptoms; it acts by allaying irritation, without producing the ill qualities of opiates, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared from one part of pure ſtrong ſpirit of nitre, and two of alcohol, without heat, in a long necked cucurbit, with a head, tubes and receivers proper for conveying the white fumes; and is called Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia volatilis,</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0059501400:8"/>
            <p>The caput mortuum of ſpirits of nitre, is what remains after the diſtillation, according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Glauber, and is called Sal neutralis<note n="*" place="bottom">The difference is very conſiderable between this ſalt and that prepared in the common manner.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs in the cures will greatly depend on the purity of the remedies. An unadulterated nitre is rarely to be obtained; as what is ſold, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly contains a portion of ſea ſalt, and is united ſometimes with a worſe ingredient.</p>
            <p>Crude antimony is often impure. The argentum vivum, even when it paſſes through leather, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently adulterated with poiſonous ingredients; therefore that uſed in the following caſes, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been revived from cinnabar. The aqulla alba at preſent is not commonly prepared; the calomel, however, which it is hoped will not be ſubſtituted for it, will not anſwer the purpoſes intended.</p>
            <p>The ſal neutralis is ſeldom to be had genuine. The medicine in the ſhops neareſt to it is the ſal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polychreſtum. The goodneſs of the calx antimonii, and the aethiops antimonialis, will greatly depend on the purity of the articles which compoſe them. The factitious and the antimonial cinnabar is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently adulterated with red lead, and if taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or received as a fumigation, muſt do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite miſchief.</p>
            <p>Every one accuſtomed to the ſtudy and practice of chemiſtry, will ſee the neceſſity of inſiſting on exactneſs to be obſerved in the preparations<note n="†" place="bottom">A number of experiments on theſe preparations, with the manner of detection if they ſhould be ſophiſticated, may be the ſubject of a future eſſay.</note>, which when properly adminiſtered, produce little, or no ſenſible operation. At firſt ſmall doſes ſhould be preſcribed, which may be gradually increaſed, as the conſtitution becomes more habituated to them.</p>

The patient was of a remarkable delicate conſtitution, exceedingly nervous and irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and had undergone repeated bleedings, by the advice of an eminent city ſurgeon, without any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. She took the pilula rubra three times a day, and a ſolution of nitre, and in about ſix weeks all the ſwellings were reſolved, and the veins of the breaſts reduced to their natural ſize. This patient, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my advice, neglected taking her remedies, and was attacked with a diſorder in the womb, and afterwards the breaſt became painful, the veins ſwelled again; but on returning to the medicines, a cure hath been obtained.</p>

                  <p>MRS. M—, in the year 1767, perceived a drawing in of the nipple, without any hardneſs of the right breaſt. An eminent ſurgeon in town adviſed an iſſue; afterwards was preſcribed the aethiop. vegetabil. and mercurial pills. The diſorder, after this, did not increaſe till towards the year 1771, hemlock was then ordered by a very learned phyſician. The breaſt ſwelled and was hard; under the arm were likewiſe tumors. In May 1772 a cauſtic was applied, under the ſpecious name of a plaiſter, to draw the cancer out. The cauſtic was continued weekly, and a poultice uſed, till the whole ſchirrus was ſphacelated and removed, which happened July the 6th. It was afterwards dreſſed with Turner's cerate, healed, and continued well for two years, though little indurations, about the ſize of peaſe, appeared on the remaining part of the breaſt. From the latter end of 1774, until the ſpring of 1775, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient had conſiderable pains. The part where the cauſtic had been fixed, broke out again; the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the axilla was enlarged, and preſſing on the great veſſels, occaſioned a conſiderable ſwelling in the arm. The ſurgeon, mentioned in the laſt caſe, was conſulted, who promiſed confidently a cure, and boldly applied cauſtics to the tumors in the axilla; this produced a large ulcer, brought on great pain in the parts, accompanied with a cough. Afterwards, by his utmoſt efforts, the ſore could

On June the 12th I firſt inſpected the diſeaſed parts, and acquainted a relation of the patient's, that little ſucceſs could be expected, as violent methods had been uſed. An attempt, however, was made, the pilula rubra and the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis mineralis, with the calx antimonii, and a pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral mixture, were given with great ſucceſs; for in about three months the ulcers, both in the axilla and breaſt, were nearly healed; and the lady went into the country happy beyond expreſſion. In leſt than a twelvemonth, however, the ulcers broke out again, and the patient languiſhed for two or three months and died. Perhaps if no remedies whatever had been uſed, the advice of the firſt ſurgeon conſulted, attended to, this lady might probably have been living now.</p>

The pulvis mineralis alone was ordered ter de die; and was continued for ſix weeks at a time, ſpring and autumn; a regular diet was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, wine, acids, and ſalt meats were abſtained from, a quarter of a pint of warm water was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken every day before meat.

An ulcer has continued ever ſince, which is not pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, except at changes of weather in the winter ſeaſon; the pilula rubra was uſed for one month, but as no advantage was obtained, it was diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.

                  <head>CASE XXI.</head>
                  <p>MRS. P—, aged 42, had been mother of ſix children. After the delivery of the two laſt ſhe had each time a fever from cold, which occaſioned a great hardneſs of the left breaſt, that continued nearly in one ſtate for nine years. In the year 1771, the breaſt was painful, and rather increated in ſize for above three months. This alteration ſucceeded a violent inflammatory fever. From this time, until Jan. 1773, there were ſhooting pains: when, the menſes ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appear, ſome eruptions, diſcharging a ſharp watry humor, were diſcovered; the advice of an eminent phyſician was taken; ſalts and manna tinctura ſenae and hemlock pills were ordered, and perſiſted in for ſeven months: but the diſeaſe grew conſiderably worſe. In the latter end of July and all Auguſt, the ſalt water was drank; which greatly relaxed the ſtomach and inteſtines, and anſwered no good purpoſe. On October 3, 1773, ſhe applied to me for relief; the breaſt was then as large as a child's head two years old, exceſſive hard, inflamed, uneven in its ſurface, extending to the axilla, where likewise were ſome indurations, and the arm on that ſide was conſiderably ſwelled. On the lower part of the breaſt was a cancerous ulcer, ſome part of which was ſoft and fungous; there were many fiſſures, from which iſſued a very acrid diſcharge. The pains were ſo acute and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that no reſt could be obtained; a continual crying was heard, like to a perſon in labour. Bleeding was firſt preſcribed; the pilula rubra, the pulvis mineralis, and the ſolution of camphor, with the eſſentia volatilis, were adminiſtered. To the wound was applied the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In fourteen days the breaſt was greatly relaxed, the pains were conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably diminiſhed, and reſt at night was attained, before the remedies had been taken four days. The plan was perſevered in; about three months after the ulcer was healed; and the indurated parts were perfectly reſolved. The remedies how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were continued ten weeks more, when the cure was accompliſhed.</p>

                  <head>CASE XXII.</head>
                  <p>A lady of rank, between 70 and 80, had a large hardneſs of the cancerous kind in the left breaſt; a great part of the induration was extremely hard, and on the lower part was a very livid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance with little fiſſures. The whole breaſt was diſeaſed, inflamed and extended, ſo as to affect the edge of the right breaſt, and there was a large tumour towards the axilla; the pains had become exceedingly troubleſome, the ſwellings had increaſed rapidly, and were very alarming. This was a caſe in which no cure could be expected; an alleviation of the miſery alone could be attempted. The opinion I gave to ſeveral ladies of quality, friends to the afflicted patient, and the noble Lord her ſons was, that a cure was impoſſible; but that ſome hopes were entertained, that the inflammation, ſwellings and pains, in a great meaſure, could be removed. The pilula rubra was adminiſtered, with the pulvis mineralis ter de die. In about three weeks the inflammation entirely ſubſided, and all the ſwelling, except that very hardened part, in a great degree reſolved, the breaſt was relaxed, and the pains nearly abated. The pill was then inreaſed in its doſe, and the powder. This
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0059501400:25"/>courſe was continued for between two and three months, and the patient was very eaſy. The livid part at this time, as had been prognoſticated, broke and formed an ulcer; this was ſucceeded by a ſpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celus of the ſtony induration, which was thrown off gradually, and with proper aſſiſtance gently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. The diſcharge was now exceedingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, from the putridity of the parts ſloughing away; the carrot poultice was applied, but anſwered no good purpoſe whatever. In this manner the whole of the diſeaſed part came away, and there was an ulcer, in which me hand might be buried. The remedies were continued, the ulcer became clean and not offenſive, and little or no pain was experienced. The diſcharge from this large ulcer was very conſiderable, which would have been much larger, had not the medicines fortunately reſolved a very conſiderable part of the tumor: the patient gradually became weaker, and the medicines were then diſcontinued Oedematous ſwellings of the legs afterwards made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, probably owing to the univerſal relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the habit, and with very little or no pain the patient languiſhed for ſame time, and died.</p>

                  <p>MRS. B—, aged 50, was recommended for relief by a lady of faſhion, having ſeveral hardened ſwellings in her left breaſt. The right breaſt had been taken off by the knife, about one year and a half before at St. George's Hoſpital; the wound afterward healed; but the diſorder being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the other ſound breaſt, which is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common thing where the amputation is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cauſed great pain and inflammation. The pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lula rubra was given four times in the day, and

In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two months the ſwellings considerably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, the ſtony hardneſſes, detached from each other, were much ſoftened, and the pains entirely abated. The remedies, during between three or four months in the ſummer, whilſt I went to France and Holland, were perſiſted in, and on my return I found the whole of the ſwellings diſperſed, and the breaſt appeared quite ſound. This perſon then went and officiated as cook in a family, which was her former employment, and remained well for above a year; but on receiving a violent cold, the ſwellings in the breaſt appeared again without any ulcer; ſhe neglected applying for ſome time; and from appearances, there was no reaſon to hope, that the remedies could again ſucceed. The trial confirmed the opinion; for no impreſſion whatever could be made afterward on the diſeaſe. The patient became hectical, ſuffered very little pain indeed, and in about ten months after died.</p>

                  <p>IN the year 1767, M. S. a lady in the country, perceived ſome ſmall eruptions in ſeveral parts of the ſkin. Dr. Bates, a phyſician eſteemed in the neighbourhood, preſcribed a lotion. Afterwards, by the advice of Mr. Edmonds, a ſkilful ſurgeon, at Wendover, a quickſilver girdle was worn a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, and the eruptions diſappeared.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1768, an acrimony in the ſkin was again very troubleſome on uſing any conſiderable exerciſe. Various medicines were adminiſtered, but without any benefit; and the lady was adviſed to go to Brighthelmſtone, to uſe the warm bath, and drink ſea water. Theſe methods produced a great relaxation without curing the eruptions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably laid the foundation of theſe complaints,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0059501400:29"/>which afterwards became ſo dangerous and alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for a pain was ſoon felt near the neck of the bladder, ſucceeded by a ſwelling, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuppreſſed the urine.</p>
                  <p>From this time the ſymptoms became more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, the pain in the tumour was ſo exquiſite, that the lady was frequently deprived of reſt. Dr. Bates preſcribed the common uterine remedies, thinking (as I have been informed by the family) the caſe to be an ulcer of the bladder, or a ſchir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus of the uterus.</p>
                  <p>Theſe complaints gradually increaſed for two or three years, and the lady finding no relief from any remedy which was preſcribed by the medical gentlemen of the county in which ſhe reſided, it was thought neceſſary to conſult another phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. Dr. Smith, a gentleman of diſtinguiſhed reputation, and one of the profeſſors of the univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Oxford, was accordingly conſulted.</p>
                  <p>At this time the lady was incapable of uſing any exerciſe without pain. The urine was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuppreſſed; at others, it iſſued involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, commonly occaſioning great uneaſineſs.

                  <p>We now find that the hemlock, that faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deſtructive drug is adminiſtered, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt advantage. It however enables us to draw this concluſion, that the caſe was treated as a cancer. Soon after the lady had taken the hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, a giddineſs of the head was complained of, and a loſs of memory was the conſequence, which continued a conſiderable time.</p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt preſcriptions were perſiſted in till the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of December, during which time the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms became more violent; the lady continued in extreme miſery, and her memory became ſo much impaired, that ſhe could ſcarce recollect any tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action one minute paſt. This laſt complaint I muſt attribute to the hemlock; becauſe I have known ſeveral inſtances where this noxious drug has produced ſimilar effects; and one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, where it brought on comatoſe ſymptoms, and inconteſtibly proved fatal. I could here animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert on the impropriety of the foregoing preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but it is ſufficient at this time to obſerve, that they were not ſucceſsful.</p>

                  <p>Theſe cretaceous preparations, joined with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cardiacs, were intended to relieve a diarrhoea, that probably aroſe from an irritation in the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, which was afterwards productive of an ulcer in that inteſtine.</p>
                  <p>On the 14th of December a fifth conſultation was appointed; the ill ſucceſs of the preſcriptions, joined with ſome additional ſymptoms, which were concluded very dangerous, induced the phyſicians candidly to acknowledge the impoſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the lady; Dr. Hunter declared to Capt. S. the brother of the patient, in the preſence of many other friends and relations, that the diſorder was abſolutely incurable. On being queſtioned by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0059501400:36"/>a Lady preſent, who had a ſincere affection for the patient, How long it was thought M.

                  <p>The foregoing preſcriptions were certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to the cure of ſuch an obſtinate diſeaſe: but, as it is the common mode of practice, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from it perhaps would have been conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed erroneous, as being contrary to the rules of art. Eſtabliſhed maxims, however unſucceſsful, are ſeldom relinquiſhed, though the preſervation of life is frequently dependant on it.</p>
                  <p>The lady had a ſchirrus of the uterus, which produced an inexpreſſible and conſtant pain. There was a continual ſanious diſcharge of that complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and fetor, which characteriſe a cancerous ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; the patient was under the diſagreeable neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of lying in bed, for the evacuation of the urine and feces, and both were attended with great pain, and a conſiderable quantity of puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter, conſequently there was an ulcer in the rectum. Theſe ſymptoms, after the adminiſtration of the opiates and cretaceous medicines, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0059501400:37"/>with coſtiveneſs, the moſt excruciating pains, cold ſhiverings, nauſea, and ſometimes vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, loſs of memory, and a countenance, which ſeemed to foretel a total diſſolution. So emaciated and exhauſted was the patient, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeemed too weak to aſſiſt the operation of any medicine. A great part of the ſurface of the body was covered with ſcorbutic eruptions; and the leaſt motion, even from the bed to a ſopha, occaſioned the moſt painful ſenſations. At this time Lord le Deſpenſer did me the honour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me, in conſequence of my ſucceſs, in a caſe which his Lordſhip was acquainted with. At the requeſt of the brother, Captain S. I viſited the Lady on the 15th of December, 1772. I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined minutely every circumſtance, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to gain a clear information of what had been already attempted by the gentlemen who had been conſulted, and committed the whole immediately to paper, which was juſt as I have related it.</p>
                  <p>A conſideration of this complicated caſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed me, however, to believe, there yet remained ſome hopes of effecting a cure. I reſolved, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to adminiſter ſome remedies, which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience gave me reaſon to think were more adequate to the cure of ſuch inveterate complaints, than thoſe which had been already preſcribed. I began with the pilula rubra and pulvis mineralis, in very ſmall doſes, and forbad the uſe of opiates, as their bad effects in weakening, greatly overbalance the little temporary relief they give.</p>
                  <p>Theſe remedies produced ſuch excellent effects, that the coſtiveneſs was removed, and all the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were alleviated in a fortnight. The patient was then removed into the country, and recovered daily. In about one month ſhe could ſit up three
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0059501400:38"/>or four hours, though in the moſt inclement part of the winter. In about four months more by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remedies, the Lady recovered her memory perfectly, and every diſcharge had a more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearance. The eruptions entirely diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. She recovered her appetite and natural reſt, which for ſome years before ſhe had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of. By a perſeverance in the ſame medicines, and by gradually increaſing their doſes, a perfect cure was at laſt accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>The Lady continues in perfect health, and rides on horſeback, without the leaſt inconvenience.<note n="*" place="bottom">In complaints of the breaſt and womb all rough aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents are commonly injurious, eſpecially if they be of the ſchirrus kind. The giving bark, elixir of vitriol, tincture of roſes, &amp;c. &amp;c. which is a common practice, frequently does irreparable miſchief in thoſe floodings that are the forerunners of cancerous complaints, and happen between the ages of 35 and 50. Some obſervations will hereafter appear in a regular treatiſe on theſe ſubjects, as proofs of what is now advanced.</note>

Hence may be ſeen the neceſſity of examining into the merits and defects of the common modes of practice, and to depart from them, when they are demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrably proved to have their origin in ignorance; for every one who has a preciſe idea of the anatomy of the uterus, muſt be ſtruck with conviction of the impropriety of adminiſtering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections in the ſchirrus or ulcers of the womb, unleſs merely for cleanſing the vagina.</note>, both as

Remedies for the ſtone, gravel, lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bago, had been recommended; burnt ſponge, millepedes, cathartics, ſope pills, ſpiritus nitri dulcis, &amp;c. &amp;c. opiates and hemlock had been adminiſtered without any advantage. This laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy nearly deprived her of her ſenſes.<note n="*" place="bottom">Whoever would wiſh to know the direful effects of hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock may read the ſecond letter to Dr. Hunter, where reaſons are given, why this deſtructive poiſonous drug ſhould never be adminiſtered. See likewiſe De Haen's Epiſtle De Cicuta, where it is proved that Storck had been guilty of the moſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant impoſitions in recommending that deleterious remedy; for out of the 36 perſons ſaid to be cured by hemlock, 30 died miſerably, and the remaining ſix were incurable.</note> On ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination it was found, that the caſe had been miſunderſtood; for all the ſymptoms had ariſen from a ſchirrus of the womb, which preſſed on the neck of the bladder; there was likewiſe an ulcer; the diſcharge iſſuing being extremely offenſive, thin, and ſuch as ever comes from cancerous ulcers of theſe parts, eaſier to be conceived by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in midwifery, than deſcribed. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was exceedingly exhauſted, palid, and ſcarce able to take food. The pilula rubra was given in the doſe of a quarter of a grain, and eight grains of the pulvis mineralis, with the eſſentia vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis occaſionally. Theſe agreeing, in a week the doſes were increaſed, and the patient was rather eaſier. The continuance of the remedies, with occaſionally a few grains of the ſal neutralis, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the cure in about five months.</p>

                  <p>A lady of faſhion, naturally of a delicate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, above 40, who formerly had ſeveral hard labors, and particularly with her laſt child in 1761, had been ſuffering for near fourteen years with a complaint in the rectum. In the early months of pregnancy the piles were continually troubleſome, and for fourteen years after the laſt delivery, on every evacuation of the feces, was a quantity of blood diſcharged. When the diſorder was firſt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, a very eminent ſurgeon and a man-mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife injudiciouſly adviſed turpentine gliſters to be injected<note n="*" place="bottom">Certainly no practitioner who underſtood the anatomical ſtructure of the inteſtines, or who reflected on their irritabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, would have adviſed ſuch a violent heating remedy to ſuch nervous parts, already in a ſtate of inflammation.</note>; which greatly irritated the inflamed part, and after this, a purulent matter as well as blood was diſcharged, which proved exceedingly relaxing. The practitioners conſulted, finding the rectum ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated, and after exerting their utmoſt efforts to remove the complaint, perſuaded the patient, as is too common, that the diſcharge was healthful, and carried off other bodily diſorders. Upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination afterwards, it was declared, by a very eminent ſurgeon, that there was a large fungus in the inteſtine, but that no operation could prove uſeful. Depending on the opinions given, and the reputation of the practitioners conſulted, the miſery was bore with the greateſt fortitude, there not appearing the leaſt hopes of relief. Having ſeen the ſucceſsful treatment of M. S. mentioned Caſe XXVI, this lady was induced to apply to me, Sept. 8, 1774. The countenance was very pale, the whole body was exceedingly relaxed, with a great languor of ſpirits, and a hectical look;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0059501400:42"/>twice in a day was diſcharged a cupful of blood and fetid matter. The opinion I gave to the friends, was, that the rectum was ulcerated, that it would be impoſſible to determine whether relief could be obtained; upon the whole, that any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was doubtful. A trial was made. Ten grains of the pulvis mineralis were at firſt given, which agreed perfectly well, and every week the doſe was increaſed, until twenty-five grains were taken four times a day, for ſix weeks. Nouriſhing diet, rather of the animal gelatinous kind was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. In about two months the diſcharge had conſiderably diminiſhed; the patient continued the powders, with one grain of the calx antimonii, and had the inexpreſſible pleaſure of finding the ulcer healed, both diſcharges had ceaſed in nine months. This lady has remained perfectly well ever ſince, which is now above four years; but has taken occaſionally the ſal neutralis and the pulvis mineralis ſince the cure, by her own deſire.</p>

                  <head>CASE XXXI.</head>
                  <p>MRS. C. had, for above one year and a half, ſuffered extreme miſery, from a ſchirrus and ulcer of the uterus. The firſt practitioners in London had been conſulted, and after trying various reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as opiates, laxatives, hemlock, &amp;c. gave up the caſe as loſt. The pains were acute, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the patient of reſt; the ſchirrus was large, preſſing both on the rectum and neck of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, occaſioning a difficulty in the expulſion of urine and the feces; a fetid, purulent and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious matter was diſcharged in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, very offenſive, and evidently of the cancer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kind. Sometimes the pains were equal to the ſtrongeſt labor pains; the whole body was greatly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0059501400:43"/>emaciated, and the patient had not been able to ſit up for many months. The pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis, with one grain of the calx. antimonia, were given three times in the day, and the uſe of opiates entirely left off. In the courſe of ſix weeks, during which time the ſymptoms daily decreaſed, the patient could ſit up; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies were continued for about three months more, and all the complaints were nearly remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. About this time I went abroad, was gone for near three months, and on my return found that no one complaint remained, except ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſcharge and weakneſs. The medicines were ſtill continued, with the julep. e camphor. and there was every reaſon to conclude the patient nearly cured. Some time after, however, came on a violent diarrhoea, which proved fatal.</p>
                  <p>When an ulcer accompanies a ſwelling and hardneſs of the womb, the proſpects of cure are doubtful; in many ſuch inſtances the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, however, have afforded a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable relief for years, and kept the patients from thoſe intolerable pains, which muſt ſtrike every humane ſpectator with horror, when the common modes of treatment are alone purſued.</p>
                  <p>It is reaſonable to conclude, that, what gives ſuch extraordinary relief in deſperate caſes, and which in ſome inſtances has proved a poſitive cure, would in general prevent theſe complaints at a certain time of life; or when the diſorders firſt make their appearance.</p>
                  <p>Practitioners in general, and all authors, either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern, have conſidered theſe uterine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints incurable; upon this principle, when the diſorder is diſcovered, they often perſuade the ſuffering patient, that nothing more than the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of palliatives can be done. I have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0059501400:44"/>often been called in, after much miſchief has been done by improper practices; where there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the leaſt probability of affording relief; nay, ſometimes but a few hours before death, and then it has been with exultation reported, but with what degree of candor or humanity let the world judge, that the patient has died under my care.</p>

                  <p>MR. C—, at St. James's Palace, had been a long time afflicted with a large ſpongy excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, almoſt ſurrounding the ſphincter ani; a very conſiderable diſcharge iſſued from the rectum, exceedingly acrimonious, which inflamed the ſkin wherever it came in contact; ſeveral parts were likewiſe coroded, and formed a number of ſmall ulcers, not only in the perineum, but likewiſe in the poſterior part above the anus, cauſing moſt exquiſite torture night and day. When the faeces were evacuated, a prolapſus, or falling down of the inteſtine happened. He had applied for relief to the moſt able practitioners, laxatives had been adminiſtered, lotions, unguents, &amp;c. without any advantage. The miſery he experienced was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible. He took a ſolution of pure nitre, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the mercurius corroſivus ſublimatus, in very ſmall doſes.

                  <p>H. F—, Eſq; a married gentleman, had an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the urethra, ariſing from excreſcences, and a ſchirrus of the proſtrate gland. Bougies had been uſed a conſiderable time without remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the complaint. The patient was frequently under the neceſſity of having the urine drawn off by means of a catheter; the moſt exquiſite pain accompanied the diſcharge of urine, which iſſued in drops, and from the contracting and expulſive efforts of the bladder, joined with the reſiſtance near its neck, the moſt inexpreſſible miſery was experienced; and this happened very often; for there ſeemed, almoſt, a conſtant irritation of the parts. All diuretics and emollients had exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſymptoms; by promoting the ſecretion of urine in a diſorder which reſiſted powerfully its evacuation. A coſtiveneſs prevailed, and moſt cathartics irritated. Solid meat was ſure to cauſe pain; a milk diet had been perſiſted in by the advice of a phyſician, and the ſolvent medicines had been adminiſtered under the care of a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſurgeon, but without ſucceſs. On paſſing a ſmall bougie, I perceived a ſlight reſiſtance, as nigh as could be conjectured, within half an inch of the proſtrate grand; on puſhing on the bougie, another powerful reſiſtance was felt near the laſt mentioned part. Concluding that the firſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was from an excreſcence, and the laſt from an induration, and enlargment of the proſtrate gland;<note n="*" place="bottom">Whoever perfectly comprehends the anatomical ſituation of the parts affected, it is hoped will not condemn this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; it muſt be confeſſed the caſe did not admit of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</note> ſome hopes were ſuggeſted that what had
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0059501400:46"/>ſo effectually removed other glandular complaints, might prove beneficial in this. The pilula rubra was given, at firſt, in the doſe of half a grain, four times in the day, and perſiſted in for near three weeks, without any advantage, except that the urine was diſcharged with rather more eaſe, and the inclination to evacuate it was more diſtant in point of time. A ſolution of camphor, with the eſſentia volatilis, and the eighth of a grain of a well prepared mercurius corr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The effects were beyond expectation; for in three weeks after the urine was diſcharged with eaſe, ſmall ſloughs paſſed daily through the urethra, rather fibrous, putrid, and ſcarce more tenacious than coagulated blood. The remedies, except the ointment, were continued for three months, and a perfect cure was the conſequence.</p>

Afterwards a ſurgeon recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended ſome mercurial pills, but no ſucceſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the uſe of the remedies, he applied to a phyſician of an hoſpital, who ordered the hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock in pills, gradually increaſing the doſe, till ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen were taken in twenty four hours for a length of time, by which his memory was affected. Two conſultations of phyſicians and ſurgeons were had, and it was concluded on, to give him a ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mercury, with the ſarſaparella decoction.

In this ſituation he applied to me; he was ordered a ſimple ſoliation of pure nitre, with camphor, in which was diſſolved ſome mercurius corroſivus ſublimatus, ſo that he took the eighth of a grain three times in the day of this laſt mentioned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, preceded by a red pill of one grain.

The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies were continued; and in a few weeks after the perfect uſe of the leg was reſtored, and the ſcrophulous ſwellings in the lips ſubſided.</p>

                  <p>A GENTLEWOMAN, in the early part of life, had accidentally let a ſmall pin drop into her ear, from which iſſued a few drops of blood: lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no pain ſucceeded; but ſome time after a diſcharge of a very fetid matter was perceived, and a deafneſs on that ſide. There was no ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wax. She was adviſed, very properly, by an eminent ſurgeon, not to ſuffer the uſe of injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or any other applications; as in ſo delicate an organ, that fine membrane, the tympanum, might be probably deſtroyed, as likewiſe the little bones<note n="*" place="bottom">Malleus, incus and ſtapes.</note>, which form part of the mechanical ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this curious organ. Satisfied with this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, nothing was attempted for years; but the diſcharge continued, and was at times very offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. This lady had a fever in Auguſt 1774, of the putrid kind, with ulcerations in the throat, for which I was conſulted. It terminated happily by the uſe of the common anteſeptic remedies; as bark, elixir of vitriol, vinegar drinks, &amp;c. &amp;c. After recovery, the diſcharge from the ear was remarkably more offenſive than before. This circumſtance was communicated to me. A fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of cinnabar factitium and aethiops minera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis p. e. was uſed, by means of a proper tube every other evening to the part. Internally twice in the day was taken the pulvis mineralis, to which was added a larger portion of the aethiops, and ſome aethiop. antim This plan was continued for near three months, during which time the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge gradually decreaſed, and entirely loſt its offenſive ſmell. The powders were then directed without the fumigation; the ulcer was ſoon after entirely healed; the wax was ſecreted; and the

When the child was but eighteen months old, an inflammation of the eyes proved very troubleſome; for which a phyſician, reputedly ſkilful in the cure of childrens diſeaſes, was conſulted; but no benefit was received from his preſcription. A very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent practitioner was conſulted in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; who ordered a fomentation of white roſe leaves, to be uſed two hours in the day, and a powder to be blowed into the eyes. This plan was continued three months, and a lotion was uſed. Six leeches were applied to the inner angles of the eye, and repeated twice; but no relief was obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Application was then made to a celebrated foreigner; who ordered an iſſue in the arm, and an ounce of magneſia to be taken in a week. A phyſician at an hoſpital ordered a bliſter and an emetic. Finding no good effects from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, he declared the diſorder to be the king's evil, and that no relief could be expected until the girl reached her fourteenth year. When I firſt ſaw the child, ſhe had been blind above nine months; the cornea of both eyes was opake, but there was no diſcharge. The pulvis mineralis was given for ſix weeks every two hours in the day-time, without any apparent benefit. On the 9th week the cornea ſeemed to be nearly tranſparent; but the child could not bear any light without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite tortures: the ſame remedies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued one week longer.

It was not large, but the ſurrounding parts were callous, itched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably, the diſcharge was acrimonious; there were ſeveral ſcorbutic eruptions in different parts; the pains were acute, and almoſt conſtant. Various had been the means uſed to cure, or to relieve this complaint. Sometimes by reſt and medicine it had been healed; but, as is common, on exerciſe ſoon broke out again. For ſeveral years the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient had been adviſed to bear patiently the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſorder, under the ſpecious pretence of its being neceſſary, as a drain for all bad humors. To cure a perſon ſo far advanced in years, might make the diſorder fly to the head, and deſtroy the ſenſes; or bring on a fever, or a cough, which would prove fatal. By ſuch artifices, which are too commonly practiſed, when ſurgeons cannot cure an ulcer, was the patient perſuaded to ſuffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible miſery for ſo many years. The pulvis

In ſix weeks an evident altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the better was produced, the itching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allayed, and the eruptions cured.

                  <p>THE Lady of — L—, Eſq. aged 64, had been lame for fifteen years, from a number of ulcers in her leg; ſometimes they were rather better, at other times worſe, according to the changes of the ſeaſons. Different practitioners had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, reſt, purges, and various means had been preſcribed by ſome of the firſt practitioners in town. After many fruitleſs attempts, agreeable to the common modes of practice, to cure this caſe, it was gravely aſſerted, that it would be the lady's death, if the wounds were healed. When firſt I inſpected the caſe, there were at leaſt forty ulcers in different parts of the leg, foul, offenſive to the ſmell, diſcharging a very acrid matter. There were ſwellings and inflammation, and the pain was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, conſtantly depriving the patient of reſt. At firſt the pulvis mineralis was given three times in the day, and proper dreſſings were applied; which, in the courſe of a few weeks, produced very favourable appearances. The plan was continued, but the diſorder ſeemed to be at a ſtand, neither growing better or worſe. The pulvis mineralis was then omitted, and the pilula rubra three times in the day given; and in about three months all

                  <p>Mr. B—, St. Paul's Church-yard, who had ſuffered much miſery from the gout above twenty years, had the additional mortification to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with a ſmall ulcer near the ancle. I was conſulted, and was dubious, whether it would be proper in a gouty patient to attempt any method of cure, and only then recommended a palliative dreſſing. In about ſix months the ulcer had ſo ſpread itſelf, as to cover half the foot, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the greateſt part of the ancle. Half a pint of a very ſharp humour at leaſt was diſcharged in a day; the pain was exquiſite, had reduced the patient exceedingly, and he ſeemed to be in an alarming ſituation. I ordered the pilula alba to be taken every other night ad gr. ſs. and the part was dreſſed with ung. album. The ulcer was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; a ſit of the gout came on, the diſcharge and irritation increaſed. The gout ſeemed to have no connection with the ulcerous indiſpoſition, nor the ulcer with the gout; for the diſcharge, though conſiderably increaſed, did not in the leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0059501400:71"/>the pain. The ſtomach was attacked with the gout, a draught was preſcribed of the camphor, tinctura ſtomach. and tinct. ſacra. which removed it to the extremities. The knee, ancles and hands were affected. When the fit was over, the pill, which had been omitted during the paroxyſm was returned to, and the ſore parts were ſoon perfectly healed<note n="*" place="bottom">There has been diſcovered a ſafe and agreeable external application for the gout, which with certainty gives immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate eaſe in the moſt violent pains, and draws the diſorder from the nobler parts towards the extremities.

The pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lula alba and the ſolutio nitroſa, cured this caſe in four months, during which time the patient uſed exerciſe, and has remained well ever ſince, which is now near five years.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the variety of caſes which have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, I have found two inſtances, which I could not cure, of perſons, whoſe cuſtomary drink had been cyder.</p>

                  <p>IT is now ſincerely hoped, that mankind will be no longer perſuaded, that it would be injurious to cure old ulcers; ſo erroneouſly conſidered a drain for peccant humours. It is highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in theſe complaints, that ſome part of a ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic, or putrid acrimony, iſſuing from the ſore, is daily abſorbed and conveyed to the blood and other juices by the lymphatic veſſels, and the whole habit is, by theſe means, contaminated. <hi>A bad conſtitution is the general cauſe of the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, this afterwards becomes the cauſe of a worſe conſtitution; and while this reciprocal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in force, the ulcer will be in no diſpoſition to heal.</hi> Whatever can gradually and impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly reſtore the fluids to a mild balſamic ſtate, and regulate the ſecretions and excretions, will be found beneficial in removing theſe ſcorbutic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, ſo predominant in this country. It may be a matter, perhaps, worthy the conſideration of the ſurgeons of hoſpitals, whether ſuch rational methods of cure ſhould not be embraced, which would ſave thoſe public charities a large annual expence. Experience confirms, that ninety five at leaſt out of a hundred may be radically cured as out-patients, at the ſame time obtain their livelihood by induſtry.

            <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>SOME may poſſibly imagine, that the common unſucceſsful modes of treatment have been too freely cenſured; but, let it be conſidered, that until erroneous ſyſtems are exploded, no new diſcoveries, however important, can be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>It gives me inexpreſſible pleaſure to find, that ſeveral eminent practitioners, and ſome at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic hoſpitals, have adopted theſe new modes of treatment, and have candidly acknowledged, that conſiderable ſucceſs has attended their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors. The oppoſition the modes have experienced from others, may have ariſen from their being ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed in favour of the practice they have been accuſtomed to. The facts here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, it is preſumed, will convince them of their errors, and be the beſt anſwer to whatever may have been advanced againſt the doctrines.</p>
            <p>Though the haſty adoption of novelties has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been productive of evils in the healing art; yet, an inflexible adherence to erroneous maxims, has proved a check to philoſophical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; a bar to every uſeful improvement. The caſes here related, the reſult of many years appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are reſpectfully ſubmitted to the public conſideration, and particularly to the unprejudiced and learned practitioners in medicine; who will beſt determine, whether they merit attention. The curative methods are, ſtill, it is preſumed, capable of much improvement, and the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which gave riſe to the diſcoveries, ſhall not be wanting to proſecute ſo deſirable a purpoſe.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0059501400:75"/>
            <p>The ulcerated legs, the opacity of the cornea, partially, or totally impeding viſion, ſcorbutic, and ſchrophulous caſes, are proved, in general, to be curable. It could be ardently wiſhed, that the ſame might be aſſerted, with equal confidence, in confirmed cancerous diſeaſes. Theſe ravaging complaints, however, if not too far advanced, can frequently be removed. When poiſonous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies have been adminiſtered, or other violent practices adopted, little ſucceſs can be expected; and often the cure is as impoſſible, as in the aneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm of the aorta. The barbarous uſe of eſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotics, and the unfeeling and improper uſe of the knife, have been condemned, in all ages, by every phyſician of integrity and experience; as they have haſtened the progreſs of the cancer, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the patient.</p>
