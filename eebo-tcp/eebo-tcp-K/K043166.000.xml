            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I had a mind he ſhould ſerve; and ſo he went to be ſhot at. No arguing with me. If I ſee any thing wrong, I accoſt him directly: Look ye, Sir, do you think to go on in this faſhion? Not during my life, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you: I will acknowledge you no longer than you prove worthy; and if you can't diſcern what is befitting you, I at leaſt will judge what is proper on my part.</p>

                  <p>Well, George and I have lived together as friends. From a boy, I endeavoured to ſubject him rather to his reaſon, than his fears. If any little irregularity happened, he was no ſooner ſenſible of it, than his cheek coloured, and the bluſh of youth not only looked decent, but expreſſed an ingenuous and well-diſpoſed mind.</p>

                  <p>But the conſequence of all this? Has he a ſettled opinion? a fixed principle for a moment? He is grown up in caprice; his judgment has not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to be deciſive upon the mereſt trifle; he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted by little things, and of courſe is periſhing by little and little.</p>

Won't your Honour get ready to viſit the young ladies?—The ladies? what ladies, you blockhead?—Lady Bell, and Lady Jane, your Honour, Mrs. Bromley's handſome nieces. Po! you're a numſkull, ſays he, with an oblique kind of a ſmile; ſtretched his arms, yawned, talked to himſelf, and bade me go about my buſineſs.</p>

                  <p>Aye! Sir Harry! I am glad he is of age, and that I am no longer his guardian. He has not had a new idea in his head ſince he was five years old, and yet the blockhead affects to be lively. He runs after wits, who do nothing but laugh at him.

                  <p>The young ladies are pretty well in their way too.

                  <p>Obſerve old Bygrove. He pronounces with rigour upon the conduct of others, and hopes his own follies lie concealed. His whole ſtruggle is to eſcape detection, He hoodwinks himſelf, and thinks he blinds you. Poſitive and dogmatical in his opinions, yet a dupe to the deſigns of others; and flattering himſelf that a peeviſh and cenſorious ſpirit hides every defect, he gives you the full ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule of his character.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>MIL.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>DASH.</speaker>
                  <p>Mark him with the widow: you will ſee him ſighing for his deceaſed wife and Mrs. Bromley's charms at the ſame time. One eye ſhall weep for the dead, and the other ogle the living.</p>

                  <speaker>DASH.</speaker>
                  <p>Miſs Neville is the beſt of them. Mrs. Bromley has taken her into her houſe, as a poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, whom ſhe pities; and her pity is no more than the cruel art of tormenting an unhappy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon her generoſity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>MIL.</speaker>

                  <speaker>DASH.</speaker>

                  <p>Yes; he is in love with Miſs Neville; and the beſt of the ſtory is, he is afraid I ſhall think him ridiculous. If I ſay the word, and promiſe not to laugh at him, he breaks his mind at once. Miſs Neville ſees clearly that he admires her, and of courſe will never liſten to Malvil. The ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted deſigns of that fellow ſhall be diſappointed.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1182600600:35"/>all, and ſo reſolve without judgment. Take the advice of your friends before you come here to play the antic tricks of love; to kneel, cringe, fawn, flatter, and make yourſelf ridiculous. Do you know enough of the world to judge for yourſelf? Can you tell what they are all doing in the gay ſphere of life? The young are all bred up under the veterans of vice and folly. The ſee their mothers with autumnal faces, playing the agreeable, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geting that they are no longer young. The men are advanced beyond all former bounds, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men preſs cloſe aſter them. A club for the ladies! intrepidity is now the female charm: to compleat their career, there is nothing left but to build a turf Coterie, at Newmarket, and ride their own matches, over the four mile courſe.</p>

                  <p>Tyrannical woman! ſome virtues ſhe has; but they are overſhadowed by their oppoſite qualities. Her love of praiſe, is a groſs appetite
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1182600600:37"/>of flattery. She oppreſſes with kindneſs, and her very civilities are ſure to be diſobliging. Oh! ſtate of dependance! for mere ſupport, to be ſubject every hour to caprice and arrogance!—Is it pride that makes me feel with this ſenſibillity?—No, my heart can anſwer it is not. I can bow to the hand that relives me; but I cannot ſtoop to the ſervile office of pampering vanity and oſtentation, with low and fulſome flattery. What does Lady Bell mean by talking to me of Sir Harry? She does it—I know her goodneſs—ſhe does it to ſoften affliction, and, if poſſible, divert a mind depreſſed with ſorrow. Sir Harry never threw away a thought on me. He behaves, indeed, with marked civility; but I don't know what to think of him. I muſt not aſpire too high: no, I have no pretenſions.</p>

The treacherous, faithleſs, dear deluding</q>—then returns in an inſtant; hands dangling; eyes imploring; tongue faultering; <q>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Bell, —Lady Bell—when you know that I adore you</q>—And I burſt into a fit of laughter in his face: Oh! that's my joy, my triumph, my ſupreme delight.</p>

                  <p>I dare ſay not: I don't think they are too forward. I am ſorry to ſee, in one of the papers to-day, a character of Sir Harry, not at all favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. His little follies, his whims, and caprices one does not mind: He may walk in Daſhwould's train as long as he pleaſes; that only makes him ridiculous. But it grieves me to hear that perfidy ſtains his character, and, as I am told, the worſt of perfidy: the ruin of beauty and innocence is his ruling paſſion.</p>

                  <p>Nor I; I never-charge any body; but upon recollection, the letter in the news-paper is imputed to him. Mrs. Bromley, I know, has no opinion of Sir Harry.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1182600600:45"/>to lead her a weary life, and if I can prevail upon Millamour to renounce Lady Bell, and marry the widow, my buſineſs is done.

I muſt get clear of him, and talk further with Miſs Neville.</p>

                  <p>Oh! no. To ſport with her would be inhumanity. But a briſk widow, is fair game.</p>

                  <p>But he does not act from his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Fits and ſtarts of paſſion govern him. If in any one purſuit of real uſe, he had half the alacrity of mind, with which he runs on, from one folly to another, he would be a man for the ladies to pull caps for. But he lives for ever in inconſiſtencies. One action of his life is the ſure forerunner of the contrary. Firſt Malvil is his favourite! then arm in arm with me: Can any two things be more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite? It is the ſame among the ladies! they all have him by turns, and the whim of one moment, is ſure to find a ridiculous antitheſis in the next.</p>

                  <p>But the malice falls on me only. Why will not Millamour know his own mind? Lady Bell
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1182600600:50"/>loves him; I know ſhe does. I am thwarted in the tendereſt point; what muſt be done?</p>

The wit in vogue, expoſes one man; makes another expoſe himſelf; gets into the ſecrets of an intimate acquaintance, and publiſhes a ſtory to the world; belies a friend; puts an anecdote, a letter, an epigram into the news-paper; and that is the whole amount of modern wit.</p>

                  <p>Well, Sir, we'll adjourn the debate. You may go on; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent every thing; if there is nothing ridiculous, invent a ſtory: and when you have done it, it is but a cheap and a frivolous talent. Has a lady a good natural bloom? Her paint muſt be an expenſive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. Does ſhe look grave? She will ſin the deeper. Is ſhe gay and affable? Her true character will come out at the Commons. That is the whole of your art, and I leave you to the practice of it.</p>

                  <p>Jack Invoice! He never was intended for any thing but to be laughed at.

                  <p>I know you have the grimace of character. Mr. Malvil, arm'd at all points with plauſible maxims. But which of your maxims can juſtify the treachery of betraying the ſecret of a friend? Who does it, is a deſtoryer of all confidence; and when he attempts to varniſh his conduct, with the ſpecious name of friendſhip, the malignity ſtrikes the deeper: artful, ſmiling malignity.</p>

                  <p>I deſerve all this. Friendſhip in exceſs is a fault. There are bounds and limits even to virtue. It would be well if a man could always hit the exact point. There is however ſomething voluptuous in meaning well.</p>

                  <p>Mrs. Bromley, I have much to ſay to you. My obligations to you I ſhall never forget. I am not aſhamed, even in the preſence of Sir Harry, to own the diſtreſs in which you found me. If at any time I have given offence; if under your diſpleaſure, I have been impatient, you will allow for an educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that raiſed me much above my circumſtances. That education ſhall teach me to act as becomes Sir Harry's Lady, with affection, with duty to him; and to you, madam, with gratitude, for that bounty which ſaved me from calamity and ruin.</p>

                  <p>Your words overpower me. I feel that I have done wrong. I now ſee, that to demand in return, for favours conferred, an abject ſpirit, and mean compliance, is the worſt uſury ſociety knows of. I rejoice at your good fortune: your merit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it.</p>
