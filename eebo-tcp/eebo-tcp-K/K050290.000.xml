            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAVING Treated in brief
upon the Difficult Subject
of <hi>Credit,</hi> and that, if (the
Town is not a Deceiver),
with ſome Succeſs; it ſeems
neceſſary to ſpeak a Word or two upon
the great Object, upon which that Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
Operates, <hi>viz. Loans of Money</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Publick Demands.</p>
            <p>The Author, <hi>an Enemy to long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces,</hi>
preſents his Thoughts to the
World upon this Head, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apology than this, That he thinks it
a Service at this time, to remove the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0040203900:4"/>
Miſtakes which ſome make, and others
improve to our Diſadvantage, while
they think it is to the Diſadvantage of
ſome Body elſe: While they aim at
an Object they would hurt, they Wound
themſelves; and in Proſecuting private
or Party-Prejudices, Injure, Weaken, and
Aſſault the Publick Good; which every
Man has a Property in, and therefore is
in Duty bound to Defend.</p>
            <p>A Diſcourſe upon <hi>Credit,</hi> is naturally
an Introduction to a Diſcourſe upon <hi>Loan</hi>;
<hi>Credit</hi> without <hi>Loan</hi> is a Beautiful Flower,
fair to the Eye, fragrant to the Smell, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental
to the Plot of Ground it grows
in; but yielding neither Fruit nor Seed,
neither Profit to the Poſſeſſor of it, by
making due Advantage of its Produce, or
Benefit to Poſterity, by Propagation of its
Species. On the other Hand, <hi>Loans</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Credit</hi> are like the Labouring Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
upon a Barren Soil, who Works,
Cultivates, Sweats, and Toils, but to no
purpoſe, all the Fruit of his Labour, ends
in Sterility and Abortion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loans</hi> are the Conſequences of <hi>Credit,</hi>
and the Evidence of that particular Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which in the preceding Diſcourſe of
<hi>Credit,</hi> I lay'd down as its Foundation; I
mean General Probity, Punctual, Juſt,
and Honourable Management.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0040203900:5"/>
To explain Things as I go; tho' this
needs but little: By <hi>Loans,</hi> I am now to be
underſtood to mean, <hi>Lending Money to the
preſent Government</hi>: The Thing will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to private Affairs, and I might take
up a great deal of your Time, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Effects of <hi>Credit</hi> in Trade, ſuch
as delivering Goods by Tradeſmen to
one another, Paper-Credit in Affairs of
Caſh; Pledging, Pawning, and all the
Articles of Security for Money, practis'd
in General Commerce; but theſe Things
are not to the preſent Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Author of this, confines his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the Government Borrowing
Money of the Subject, whether upon Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities
Eſtabliſh'd by Parliament equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
in Value deliver'd, publick Faith,
general Credit, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The Nature of theſe Securities, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the Uſefulneſs, and the Foundation
they ſtand on, are no part of the preſent
Subject; they are reſerv'd by the Author
to a Head by themſelves, if Leiſure and
the publick Service make it proper to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
you a Diſcourſe upon <hi>Funds.</hi>

            <p>The preſent War, which, with a ſmall
Interval of an unſetled and Impolitick
Peace, is now in its 22d Year, has
been remarkable in ſeveral Circumſtances,
above all the Wars that ever this Nation
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0040203900:6"/>
has been Engag'd in, ſince the <hi>Roman's</hi>
poſſeſs'd it.</p>
            <p>It has been,<list>
                  <item>The longeſt in it's Duration</item>
                  <item>The Fierceſt and moſt Expenſive in
Blood;</item>
                  <item>The moſt Famous in Succeſſes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of Victories;</item>
                  <item>It has been carry'd on againſt the moſt
Powerful Enemies;</item>
                  <item>It has produc'd the moſt firm, and the
Greateſt Confederacy;</item>
                  <item>And it has in View, the moſt Glorious
Concluſion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Together with theſe Things, it has
this alſo peculiar to it; that it has been
carry'd on at an Expence, which has ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
not all that ever went before it
only, but all that it could be imagin'd, was
poſſible for any Nation of our Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the World, to ſupport.</p>
            <p>Not the <hi>Fr.</hi> King only has been deceiv'd
in the Efforts made by this Nation in the
Proceſs of the War; which, as penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as he is, he never thought poſſible;
but is is moſt certain, had the wiſeſt and
beſt Calculator in the Iſland been told
what the Undertaking would have call'd
for, he would have determined it to be
forty Millions Sterling beyond what the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0040203900:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nation was able to do, and that without
ſelling the very Nation, it could not be
done.</p>
            <p>As the view of the Expence would have
made us wiſely have avoided the War,
and either not have begun it, or long
ſince ended it, upon the beſt Terms we
could obtain from the Enemy; ſo had
the Enemy believed <hi>England</hi> capable of
ſupporting the War, at ſuch a prodigy of
Expence, he would never have begun it;
which the King of <hi>France</hi> himſelf has been
heard, in Terms very plain, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>When upon the Revolution the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
fell moſt willingly into the War, as
a thing the Enemy, by eſpouſing King
<hi>James</hi>'s Intereſt, made abſolutely Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary:
The firſt Brach of our Expence
was carried on in the common Road of
levying Taxes, and the Money required
for every Years Expence was raiſed and
paid within the Year.</p>
            <p>The Nation was rich, Trade prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
great, Paper-Credit run high, and
the Goldſmiths in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> &amp;c.
commanded immenſe Summs; Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
were indeed in Practice, they
had been ſo of Old, and borrowing Clauſes
were added to the Bills of Aid; but theſe
laſted but a few Months, the Money
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0040203900:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
came in of courſe, and they were paid
off in their turn: Land-Tax, Polls, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Duties of Cuſtoms, Exciſes, and
the like, were the Ways and Means by
which theſe things were done; the Year
generally ſupported its own Demands,
all the Loans were ſuppoſed to be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
and to end with the Collection.</p>
            <p>As the War every Year grew heavier
upon us, and the Expence increaſed, new
Ways and Means were neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the growing Demand, till all the
Taxes that could be raiſed, by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Way, were found little enough to
bring the Annual Expence about.</p>
            <p>This put the Commiſſioners of the
Treaſury upon liſtening to new Taxes,
and entertaining all the Projects for raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Money, that the working Heads of
the Age could ſupply them with.</p>
            <p>Theſe, back'd with Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
were too unadviſedly ſuppoſed
to raiſe ſuch certain Summs as the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Occaſions then call'd for, and borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Clauſes were added to them, limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the ſaid Summs; which paſs'd as a
giving the Treaſury Credit upon the Acts
of Parliament for ſuch Summs as they
were granted for; but the Collections
falling infinitely ſhort of the Summs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
left the Publick in Arrear to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0040203900:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lenders, and from hence came the great
Load of Deficiencies, which the Nation
feels the Weight of to this Hour.</p>
            <p>As the Summs given fell ſhort, ſo the
War called every Year for ſtill greater
Summs; which added to the Deficiencies
of the old Taxes, grew ſo heavy, that
our Mannagers found it was in vain to
ſtruggle with the Difficulty any Longer,
upon the foot of Annual Taxes; and that
it was next to impoſſible to raiſe every
Year what the publick Occaſions call'd
for.</p>
            <p>This lead them of courſe to a new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to ſupply the great Demands of the
War, (<hi>viz.</hi>) by Eſtabliſhing Annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
of limited or perpetual Intereſts for
ſuch Summs, as might be borrowed upon
the Credit of the Nation, the Principal to
ſink in the Hands of the Publick. Theſe
were call'd FUNDS.</p>
            <p>To encourage the People to lend upon
theſe Funds, Premioes for advancing the
Money, large Intereſts, and other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
were annex'd; ſuch as 14 <hi>per
Cent. per Annum</hi> upon Annuities, with
Survivourſhip, Chance of Prizes by way
of Lottery, 7 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon Exchequer
Bills, <hi>and the like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, together with the innumerable Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
which upon the Deficiency of former
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0040203900:10"/>
Taxes as aforeſaid, went about the Town
upon Diſcount, and the great Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of running Caſh, by calling in the old
Coin, was the firſt riſe given to the Art
and Myſtery of Stock-Jobbing; a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
whether good or evil in its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
to the publick Affairs, is not to
the preſent Purpoſe to enquire.</p>
            <p>By this Method has the greateſt part
of our Yearly Taxes, ſince that time, been
raiſed; the Parliament Eſtabliſhing Funds
for payment of Intereſt, and the People
advanving Money, by way of Loan, on
thoſe Intereſts.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper here for ſome
People to reflect, That in the Advantages
granted by the Government upon theſe
Loans, and the great Diſcounts upon Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
on the deficient Aids, mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
were founded the great ſtocks of
Money, Banks and powerful Credit;
with which ſome People are grown to
ſuch a height, eſpecially in their own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
as to talk of influencing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs, and as it were menacing the
Government with Apprehenſions of their
Lending or not Lending, as they are, or
are not pleaſed with the Management of,
or Managers in the publick Oeconomy;
and this is the Subject I am a little to
ſpeak to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0040203900:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
LOANS to the Government, by the
Gradations aforeſaid, having been found
eſſentially Neceſſary, the firſt Steps to
that new Method were found fatally In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbering;
the high <hi>Premio's</hi> given, the
great Advantages propoſed, and the large
Intereſts paid to the Lender. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
appear'd like a diſtreſſed Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
who was every Day ſqueez'd to Death
by the exorbitant greedineſs of the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
the Citizens began to decline Trade
and turn Uſerers; Foreign Commerce
attended with the hazards of War, had
infinite Diſcouragements, and the People
in general drew home their Effects, to
embrace the Advantage of lending their
Money to the Government. Then grew
up the BANK, whoſe ſecond Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being founded upon a Parliamentary
Security, for making good the deficient
Tallies; was formed by receiving in thoſe
Tallies at <hi>Par,</hi> which coſt the Subſcribers
but 55 to 65 <hi>per Cent</hi>; by which the
greateſt Eſtates were raiſed in the leaſt
time, and the moſt of them, that has been
known in any Age, or in any part of the
World.</p>
            <p>This, I ſay, turn'd the whole City in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Corporation of Uſury, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
not as a <hi>Bank,</hi> but rather one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Society of Bankers; all Men that

could draw any Money out of their
Trades, run with it to <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi>
to buy Stocks and Tallies, Subſcribe
to Banks or Companies; or to the
Exchequer with it to put into Loans,
and lend it upon the advantageous FUNDS
ſettled by Parliament.</p>
            <p>It is meet to mention theſe things, for
the ſake of the People who have gotten
ſuch great Eſtates by the Government, to
let them know from whence the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
they have made, did proceed; and
alſo for ſome other Reaſons which will
appear in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The Government, to preſerve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Advantage of theſe Loans, and
yet to avoid being Impoſed upon and
Oppreſt by thoſe exorbitant Intereſts
and Encouragements, about the Year
1698. entered into Meaſures to ſecure the
Loan of Money, and yet lower the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
given to the Lenders.</p>
            <p>The firſt was done by the Parliament,

Erecting a punctual, juſt, and fair Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the Payments; by which
every ſeveral Engagement being Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

This tedious Recapitulation of Things
will appear leſs trouble to the Reader,
when he ſees the uſe I ſhall make of it.</p>
            <p>Here may be ſeen ſeveral Things,
which, if well conſidered, tend to the
lowring the high and extravagant Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of ſome People, with reſpect to
<hi>Loans, Credit, Borrowing</hi> and <hi>Lending</hi> of
Money to the Government; ſuch as
theſe.<list>
                  <item>I. Large Intereſt, Advantages,
<hi>Premio's</hi> for advance of Money, and
the like, will bring in <hi>Loans</hi> in ſpight
of Parties, in ſpight of Deficiencies,
in ſpight of all the Conſpiracies in
the World to the contrary; while
a juſt, honourable, and punctual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
on the part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
does but maintain the Credit
of the Nation.</item>
                  <item>II. As the Affairs of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have made <hi>Loans</hi> neceſſary,
and they can not go on without Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing;
ſo the ſtream of Trade and
Caſh is ſo Univerſally turn'd into
publick Funds, the whole Ntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
feels ſo much of gains, ſo much by,
and depends ſo much upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Credit, that they can no more
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0040203900:14"/>
do without the Funds, than the
Funds can do without the Loan.</item>
                  <item>III. Theſe Borrowings and Lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are become ſo much a Trade,
ſo many Families have their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
from, and get ſo great
Eſtates by the Negotiating theſe
Things, that it is impoſſible for any
particular Sett of Men to put a ſtop
to it; or to get any ſuch Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Hands, as to give the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
juſt Grounds of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
that this or that Party
of Men can put a Cheque to the
publick Affairs, be they <hi>Whigs, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
                     <hi>City, Court, Banks, Company,</hi>
or what they pleaſe to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not tye my ſelf to ſpeak to theſe
apart, <hi>the liberty of this Tract will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of it,</hi> but in a Summary way you will
find the Fact Demonſtrated, and the
Conſequence Evident.</p>
            <p>Men in Trade, more eſpecially than the
reſt of Mankind, are bound by their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;
Gain is the end of Commerce, where
that Gain viſibly attends the Adventurer,
as no Hazard can diſcourage, ſo no other
Obligation can prevent the Application<q>Impiger extremos currit Mercator ad Indos.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0040203900:15"/>
To pretend after this, that Parties ſhall
Govern Mankind againſt their Gain, is
to Philoſophize wiſely upon what <hi>may be,</hi>
and what would be Politick to bring to
paſs; but what no Man can ſay was ever
put in Practiſe to any Perfection; or can
be ſo by the common Principles that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
Mankind in the World.</p>
            <p>There have been Combinations in
Trade, and People have ſeem'd to act
counter to their preſent Intereſts; nay,
have gone on in apparent Loſs, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of ſuch Combinations; but they
have always been made in order to ſecure
a Return of greater Gain; and therefore
the Laws made againſt ſuch Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are not made to prevent Peoples go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on to their Loſs, but to prevent the
end of that appearing Loſs; <hi>viz.</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſment
or Monopolizing of Trade, to
come at ſome Advantage over others, and
thereby make an exorbitant Gain.</p>
            <p>But it was never yet heard, that the
Zeal of any Party got the better ſo much
of their Intereſt, as to put a general Stop
to the current and natural Stream of their
Intereſt; that a People ſhould reject the
fair and juſt Advantages which have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſo many Eſtates, and are the due
Supplies to the Breaches made by the
War upon general Commerce. To talk,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0040203900:16"/>
that we will not lend Money to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
while the Parliament ſettles
Funds, allows Intereſts, gives <hi>Premio's</hi>
and Advantages, is to ſay, Nature will
ceaſe, Men of Money will abſtain from
being Men loving to get Money. That
Tradeſmen ſhould ceaſe to ſeek Gain, and
Uſerers to love large Intereſts; that Men
that have gain'd Money ſhould leave off
deſiring to get more; and that Zeal to a
Party ſhould prevail over Zeal to their
Families; that Men ſhould forfeit their
Intereſt for their Humour, and ſerve
their Politicks at the price of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe that promiſe themſelves theſe
things, enquire among the Merchants,
and ſee if Parties govern any thing in
Trade; if there is either <hi>Whig</hi> or <hi>Tory</hi>
in a good Bargain; Churchman or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter
in a good Freight; High Church
or Low Church in a Good Adventure;
if a Shop-keeper ſees a good Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,
a Scrivener a good Mortgage, a
Money'd Man a good Purchaſe; Do they
ever ask what Party he is of that parts
with it? Nay, rather in ſpight of Party
Averſions, do we not Buy, Sell, Lend,
Borrow, enter into Companies, Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
and the cloſeſt Engagements with
oen another, nay Marry with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0040203900:17"/>
without any Queſtions of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
            <p>Let us come to the general Body of
People as Fate has unhappily divided us;
where are the Men? ſuppoſing a Party
Conſpiracy againſt the Government in
this matter of Loan; Where are the Men
who would hold together, and refuſe
making ſeven <hi>per Cent.</hi> of their Money to
preſerve the Engagement? Where the
Men who would ſtay their Hands, and
loſe the probability of gaining a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds a Year by a Lottery? <hi>No,</hi>
               <hi>no,</hi> it is not to be done; the ſtream of
Deſire after Gain runs too ſtrong in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
to bring any thing of that kind to
Perfection in this Age. The thing is ſo
impracticable in its Nature, that it ſeems
a Token of great Ignorance in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the Age to ſuggeſt it; and a
Man would be tempted to think thoſe
People that do ſuggeſt it, do not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
believe what they ſay about it.</p>
            <p>In the matter of Loan it next comes
in our way to enquire, how does the
Caſh of the Nation, which is the thing we
are upon, ſtand divided, and how is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in hazard of any Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this kind? If it be poſſible to make
this Enquiry without any Party By aſs,
and ſo as to give Offence to neither ſide,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0040203900:18"/>
it ſhall be done. I do not ſay who is in,
or who out; who has the Management,
who had it, or who would have it; let
that ſtand as it does, or may; but how
do the Parties ſtand, with reſpect to one
another; ſuppoſing any one Party would
endeavour to ſtagnate the general Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Credit, in Prejudice of the other:
As for the purpoſe;</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Whig Adminiſtration, and all
the High Church Men and their Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
in hopes to reduce them to Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Management, ſhould Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
together to run down the Publick
Credit, and lend no Money on any of
the Funds. <hi>Vice Verſa</hi>; ſuppoſe a Reverſe,
and the Whigs in general ſhould do the
ſame thing: Let us enquire; Are either of
theſe Parties ſso rich in Caſh, ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in Lending, that all the <hi>Loans</hi> muſt
depend upon their Money; or are either
of theſe Parties ſo inconſiderable in this
Caſe, that their Support ſhall ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without the concurrence of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
If the laſt were true, that weak
Party could make no manner of Figure
in this Government, or be ſignificant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for the Sovereign without viſible
Diſtraction to engage with. To deſcend
to Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0040203900:19"/>
The Notion is general, at leaſt among
themſelves, that the Groſs of the Caſh
is with the Whigs; and the <hi>Review</hi>
ſpeaks of it as a thing capable of ſome
Demonſtrations; tho' with his good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
it may be ſaid, he may be miſtaken.
Some have gone a length beyond the
Author of the <hi>Review,</hi> and will have it,
that the Money lies in the Hands of the
Diſſenters; and will allow the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
eſpecially the High-Church-Men
to have little enough for themſelves,
and by conſequence leſs to ſpare to the
Publick Loans.</p>
            <p>Others will tell you, the High-Church-Party
have a large ſhare of the Nation's
Caſh in their Hands; that they have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
a Proportion of Money, and
beyond Compariſon more Land than the
other. They add, That as they have
more Land, they can when they pleaſe
have more Money; and that therefore
tho' they ſhould grant that the Low-Church
and Diſſenters put together, have
the moſt ready Money, yet allowing
them the Superiority in the Lands, they
can fetch the Money into their own
Hands when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>It is not for me to determine who
has moſt Land, or who moſt Money;
it is my Opinion, neither have ſo much
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0040203900:20"/>
or ſo little, as to render them Formidable
or Contemptible to one another in the
Matter of Loan. Both Sides have enough
to be uſeful to, and both Sides have little
enough to ſtand in need of one another;
and in this Diviſion the Ballance of Parties
(which at this time is the onely Felicity
that we can find in having any Parties at
all,) does conſiſt.</p>
            <p>I make no Difficulty to Acknowledge,
That where the Land is, there is the
Foundation of all the real Wealth in the
Nation: I do not ſay, it is in this or that
Party excluſive; That the Gentlemen,
who call themſelves of the High-Party,
have a great ſhare of the Land, is moſt
certain, but that they have ſo much
more than the Whigs and Diſſenters
join'd, as ſome will alledge, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
No doubt where the Land is,
there can be no want of Money, becauſe
Land will at any time raiſe Money;
whereas Money, without the Aſſiſtance
of Trade, Landed-men, or Governments,
can operate no way, but like the Viper,
preying upon it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This leads me to Examine the
Difference between <hi>Loan</hi> and <hi>Fund</hi> in
this Caſe. Examining which, ſomething
may perhaps come to light for our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0040203900:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which has not been much thought
of before,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The Borrower is Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the Lender</hi>; but with the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
leave, in this Caſe it is not ſo.
<hi>Solomon</hi> is there to be underſtood ſpeaking
of the poor borrowing Wretch, who Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
upon the Foot of Charity and
Compaſſion, and therefore he juſt before
ſays, <hi>The Poor uſes many Entreaties, but
the Rich anſwer roughly.</hi> The poor Man
that Borrows on his ſingle Promiſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his urgent Neceſſity, <hi>uſes Entreaties,</hi>
as we may ſay, <hi>He Begs to Borrow</hi>; but
the <hi>rich Lender</hi> is ſurly, hardly conſents,
<hi>anſwers Roughly,</hi> and is with Difficulty
brought to Lend.</p>
            <p>But we are to Diſtinguiſh here between
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s Borrower deſcrib'd as above, and
he that Borrows on a ſufficient current
Security: He is no more Servant to the
Lender than the Lender is Servant to
him; having an unqueſtion'd Security to
give, he ſcorns to ask you twice; but if
you do not think fit to lend your Money,
he goes to another.</p>
            <p>This is apparent in the <hi>Public Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi>
as well as in private; and will
make it out, if ever put to the Teſt,
That the People of <hi>England</hi> ſtand in as
much need of <hi>the Funds</hi> to lend their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0040203900:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Money upon, as the Government ſtands
in need of their Money <hi>upon thoſe Funds.</hi>
I prove this by a matter of Fact, freſh in
your Memories, and undeniable in all
its Circumſtances. In the Beginning of
the War, when the Money lay abroad in
TRADE, the Knowledge of Affairs young,
and the People not apprized of the thing;
the Anticipations upon Taxes and Loans
came heavy, and were ſmall, <hi>What drew
them on?</hi> Large Premio's, high Intereſts,
Chances of Prizes, Survivorſhip, and the
like.</p>
            <p>Thus when the Neceſſities of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
were great and their Credit
young to Borrow, the Lenders made their
Market: But when the Government
found themſelves <hi>rich in Funds,</hi> their
Demands, <hi>tho' great,</hi> yet not preſſing;
Credit Eſtabliſh'd, the Parliament, <hi>the
great Fund of Funds,</hi> and Center of
Credit, ready to make good Deficiencies,
and leaving no room for Jealouſies in the
Minds of the People, <hi>What was the
Caſe?</hi> You took off your Premio's, you
drew no more Lotteries for 16 Years,
you lower'd your Intereſt, you brought
your Annuities from 14 to 7 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
and your Intereſt on Tallies from 7 to 6
<hi>per Cent. per Ann.</hi> From 7 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon
Exchequer-Bills, you came down to 4
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0040203900:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>per Cent.</hi> And what was the Conſequence?
The Neceſſity of the Lenders being
more to lodge their Money for Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than the Neceſſity of the Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
was to ask, they came always down
to your Price; and had you brought the
general Intereſt of Loans to 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
they muſt have come down, for Money
is no longer Money than it can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd.
<hi>Nay, it is to be obſerv'd,</hi> the
Eagerneſs of the People to bring in their
Money encreaſed, as the Advantages of
Lending decreaſed: Having no way to
improve it better, they were under an
abſolute Neceſſity of bringing it in, for
the ſake of the Improvement.</p>
            <p>Are theſe any of the People, who can
be ſuppoſed to ſay to the Parliament,
They will not lend their Money? It
would almoſt provoke a Man to laugh at
them. You won't lend your Money!
Why, what will you do with it?</p>
            <p>Perhaps you wont lend it to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<hi>well</hi> you will <hi>then</hi> lend it upon
private Security, upon Land, and the
like; why then thoſe you lend it to, will
lend it to the Government, and ſo the
Malice of the Affair will be loſt, and the
Advantage too. Will you run it into
Trade? <hi>Do ſo by all means.</hi> Some of
thoſe Hands it will Circulate through,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0040203900:24"/>
will lend it to the Government. Your
very <hi>Export</hi> and <hi>Import</hi> is a Loan to the
Government. In ſhort, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall have your Money <hi>firſt or laſt,</hi>
do what you will with it.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe it were poſſible to divide this
Nation into two Parts, the Landed-men
and the Money'd-men, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were to be put into the Hands of
the <hi>Firſt</hi> againſt the Conſent of the <hi>Last</hi>;
and the Money'd-men knowing the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-men
could not carry on the War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Money, reſolv'd to lend them none,
I mean as a Government, What Courſe
ſhould the Landed-men take?</p>
            <p>In my Opinion, they ſhould paſs an
Act, That none of thoſe People ſhould
be admitted to lend any Money to the
Government at all; What then would
be the Conſequence? They would be
immediately diſtreſs'd with the Weight
of Money without Improvement; they
would eagerly lend it to the Landed-men
at 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon their Land; and
they again lending it to the Government
at 6 and 7 <hi>per Cent.</hi> the Government
would be ſupply'd, and the Landed-men
would get 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> by the other Mens
Money.</p>
            <p>I am not making Application; but let
any of the preſent Parties, who Boaſt of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0040203900:25"/>
their having the Groſs of the Money,
reflect what they would ſay, if an Act
were to paſs, That no <hi>Whig</hi>'s Money, or
no <hi>Diſſenter</hi>'s Money, or no High-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Money ſhould be accepted upon
Loan; That they ſhould not be allow'd
a Transfer upon any Stock, or to Buy
any Annuity; the Complaint would be
very loud of their being excluded the
common Advantages of their Fellow-Subjects;
and that paying their Share of
Taxes, they ought to have room for equal
Improvements, and ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
<hi>and this is true too,</hi> it would
be hard. Then they would run about
to their Friends among the contrary
Party, ſhelter their Money under their
Names, and perhaps give ½ <hi>per Cent.</hi> or
1 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Commiſſion to others to Lend,
Buy and Transfer for them: And what
would the Government feel in all this?</p>
            <p>The Caſe is this, No Party can be
ſo fooliſh to think they can be able ſtop the
Loan of Money to the Government; nor
need the Government think of putting the
Laws in Execution againſt ſuch Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
(<hi>tho' if any ſuch appear'd, no doubt
they might be proſecuted.</hi>) Keep up but
the Credit of Parliament, and let that
Parliament find Funds, it is not in the
Power of any Party of Men to Stop
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0040203900:26"/>
the Current of Loans, any more than
they can Stop the Tide at <hi>London-Bridge,</hi>
in its conſtant Courſe of Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
from and to the Sea.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but the <hi>French</hi> have
Agents amons us, who would be glad to
weaken our Hands in the War, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
our Supplies for that Purpoſe: From
them it muſt be that theſe Notions creep
into Peoples Heads; <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men cannot
in their common Senſes be ſo weak; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us that we ſhall have no <hi>Loans,</hi> is
much at one to telling us we ſhall have
no Recruits to our Army; as, while you
can Pay Armies, you ſhall never want
Men; ſo while you can pay Intereſt, you
ſhall never want <hi>Loans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Eſtates that ſome Men boaſt of,
by which they are enabled to Lend, and
made bold enough to threaten a ſtop of
it, were gain'd by Lending. Thoſe that
have them are too eager to Encreaſe them,
thoſe that want them too eager to Gain
them, by the ſame method, and all too
Covetous and too Selfiſh not to come into
any good Propoſal.</p>
            <p>The Worſt theſe Men can do, is, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
things appear backward, to raiſe the
Rate of Intereſts, and move the Parliament
to add ſomething to the uſual Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for lending; and if the Nation pays
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0040203900:27"/>
this, who have they to blame for it? Yet
neither will they be able to do this, the
preſent Credit of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament
putting it out of their Power; for as the
neceſſity of Lending will prompt on one
Hand, the undoubted Security of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Credit removes all the Jealouſies
our Party-men would raiſe on the other.</p>
            <p>The Zeal ſome Men ſhew for their
Country, as well as Juſtice to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is nevertheleſs very Conſpicuous in
this; who (firſt) to glorifie their Party-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
would have the War miſcarry, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Money ſhould be lent, while ſuch
Men Manage as they pretend not to like;
(ſecondly) reproach ſome People with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
to make Peace with <hi>France,</hi> and yet
endeavour by diſcouraging <hi>Loans</hi> to render
it impoſſible for them to carry on the War.</p>
            <p>But both theſe will be diſappointed:
While the Parliament Supports Credit,
and good Funds Support the Parliament,
Money will come in as naturally, as Fire
will aſcend, or Water flow; nor will it
be in the Power of our worſt Enemies to
prevent it.</p>
