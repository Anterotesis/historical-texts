            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they arrive at this Age, if they eat <hi>salt, sharp Things, Spices, &amp;c.</hi> whereby the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>still more and more heated,</hi> then the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> and <hi>Proneness</hi> to <hi>Venerial Embraces</hi> is very great: nay, sometimes almost inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. And a due use of these Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being denied to Virgins, very often produces very <hi>dismal Effects,</hi> as green and Weasel-Colour, short Breathings, Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

to be married to their own Content, those Afflictions vanish, and their Native Beauty returns more gay than before. Nor is their eager gazing, and desiring to associate themselves with Men a less Sign that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>prompts them</hi> to desire <hi>what she ordained</hi> their due; of which being sometimes by obdurate Parents debarr'd in a lawful Way, they break the Bounds of Modesty rather than endure such violent Agitations and Conflicts <hi>within themselves,</hi> and so satiate their Desires in unlawful Love. The same may in all particulars be observed in young brisk Widows. whom Death (that Enemy of sweet conjugal Love) has separated from the Bosom of their Husbands.</p>
               <p>At 14 Years of Age, commonly the <hi>Menses</hi> in Virgins begin to flow, and their they are capable of conceiving, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue generally to Forty-four; at what time for the most part they are no longer capable of Generation, unless such as are exceeding healthful, strong of Body, and have used themselves to Temperance, who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be delivered of Children till 55 Years; but such Prodigies rarely happen, altho' the <hi>Menses</hi> continue longer in some Women than in others, but many times such Efflux proceeds not from any natural cause, but by reason of some violent Straining, or other Violence, and doth often endanger
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0541900200:10"/>
the Life of the Party: And therefore <hi>Young Men</hi> that marry <hi>Women</hi> surmounting the Age aforesaid, if they expect Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by Miracle, must labour against the Wind: Though if an <hi>Old Man,</hi> that is not worn out by Diseases and Incontinency, marry a brisk lively Lass, there is hopes even to Threescore and Ten, and some that are extraordinary lusty, till Fourscore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> that Famous and Learned Physician, is of Opinion, that a <hi>Youth</hi> at 16 Years, or between that and 17, having much Vital Strength, may be capable of getting Children, and that Force and Heat of procreating Matter continually increases till 45, 50, and 65. And at the end of the latter begins to flag, the Seed by little and little becoming unfruitful, the natural Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being extinguished, and the Humours dried up; and in general, most Physicians to this day do observe it; but as to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as I have before mentioned, it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hapneth otherwise; nay, 'tis reported by a credible Author, that in the Reign of <hi>Ere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0541900200:11"/>
marry <hi>Young Virgins,</hi> and have Children by them; which argues that Age in <hi>Men</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not Procreation, unless they be exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in their Youth, and their Members shrivelled up. If any ask why a <hi>Woman</hi> is sooner barren than a <hi>Man? I answer,</hi> The Cause is the natural Heat, which is more predominant in the latter than in the former: For since a <hi>Woman</hi> is more moist than a Man, as her Monthly Purgations do most evidently demonstrate, as also the softness of her Body; 'tis also apparent that he doth exceed her in native Heat; and as for that Heat, it is the chief thing that concocts the Humours into good and proper Aliment; which the <hi>Woman</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, grows fat; when a <hi>Man,</hi> by reason of that Heat, melts his Fat by Degrees and his Humours are dissolved, and by the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof they are elaborated into Seed. And this may, for the better confirmation of what I propose, be added, That the <hi>Woman</hi> generally is not so strong as a <hi>Man,</hi> nor so wise and ingenious in contriving her Affairs, whereby the Faculties are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in their Operation.

               <p>WHEN a young likely Couple have entered the holy State of Wedlock, and are desirous of mutual Enjoyment for Generation-sake, which is the chief end for which Wedlock was ordained, and rather covet to be bless'd with one Sex than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let them know fitst for certain, that the success of <hi>such things</hi> depends upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence tho' secondary Causes must be <hi>active</hi> and <hi>instrumental</hi> therein, and those are especially two; <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Genital Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> which is brought by the <hi>Arteriae Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantes</hi> to the <hi>Testes</hi> in the Form of Blood, and there elaborated into Seed by the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifical Faculty</hi> resident in them. To which may be added the Appetite and Desire to Copulation, which fires the Imagination with unusual Fancies, or by the sight of a brisk, charming Beauty, whose Wit and Liveliness may much intice, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the Courage; But if Nature be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled, then are there fit Artificial Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to restore it, <hi>viz.</hi> Such Meats as most
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0541900200:13"/>
conduce to the affording such Aliment as proves to make Seed abound, and restore the Decays of Nature, that the Faculties may freely operate: For as dung and good muturing restores Ground that is worn out, and heartless, even so seasonable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Diet operates to the restoring the faint Heart, weak Spirit, coldness and driness of the Genital parts, and reduceth the weakness of the Nerves to their Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and removes Impediments, obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Procreation of Children. Then since Diet may and will after the evil state of the Body to a better, it is necessary that such as are subject to Barrenness, should eat such Meats only as tend to render them fruitful; and among such things as are inducing and stirring up thereto, are all Meats of good Juice, that nourish well, and make the Body lively and full of Sap, of which faculty are all hot moist Meats: for according to <hi>Galen,</hi> the substance of Seed is made of the pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted and windy superfluity of Blood; from whence we may conclude there is in many things a power to accumulate or heap up Seed, as also to augment it, and other things of force to cause Erection, as Hen-Eggs, Pheasants, Wood-cocks, Gnatsappers Thrushes, Black-birds, young Pidgeons, Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, Patridges, Capons, Almonds, Pine-Nuts, Raysons, Currants, all strong Wines

All these (tho' excellent Restoratives) will not have present Operation, but you must use yourself to them for a considerable time or else you will reap little or no benent by them. The Act of <hi>Coition</hi> being over, (<hi>wheren the force of Imagination is certainly very prevalent in the causing of the Child to be of this or that Sex</hi>) the Woman (say the <hi>Antients</hi>) must gently repose on her Right Side, with her Head lying low, and her Body sinking down, that by sleeping in that posture, the <hi>Cell</hi> on the Right Side of the <hi>Matrix</hi> may prove the <hi>Place of Conception,</hi> in which is the greatest force of Generative Heat, which is the chief Inducement to the Procreation of <hi>Male</hi> Children, and rarely fails to answer the expectation of those that experience it, especially if they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves warm, and without much Motion, leaning for the most part to the Right, and drinking a little of <hi>Spirit of Saffron, and Juice of Hysop</hi> in a <hi>Glass of Mallaga,</hi> or <hi>Aligant,</hi> when they lie down and rise, for the space of a Week. Now the fittest time (they say)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0541900200:15"/>
for the Procreation of <hi>Male Children</hi> is, when the <hi>Sun</hi> is in <hi>Leo,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi>'s in <hi>Virgo, Scorpio</hi> or <hi>Sagittarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Order they will also have observed for a <hi>Female Child,</hi> by lying as aforesaid on the left side, and strongly fancying a <hi>Female</hi> in the time of Procreation, especially if the <hi>Woman</hi> drink the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Female Mercury,</hi> 4 days from the 1st day of Purgation; the <hi>Male Mercury</hi> (both Herbs so called) having the like Operation in case of a <hi>Male Child</hi>; for the Juice or Decoction of those Simples are of Force, the <hi>one</hi> to purge the <hi>Right,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> the <hi>Left Side</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> and thereby open the <hi>Receptacles,</hi> making way for the Seminary of Generation: And the best time to <hi>copulate</hi> for this Sex is, when the <hi>Moon</hi> is in the <hi>wane,</hi> and the sign in <hi>Libra</hi> or <hi>Aquarius,</hi> for <hi>then</hi> they will be of a most gentle, affable temper, very fair, and perfect in all their members. <hi>Avicenna,</hi> an Author of good repute, describes the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Procreation</hi> thus: <hi>When</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Menses are spent, and the Womb is cleansed, which is commonly</hi> 5 <hi>days, or</hi> 7 <hi>at most, if a man lie with his wife from the first day she is purged to the fifth, she will conceive a Male; but from the fifth to the eight a Female, and from the eighth to the twelfth a Male again: But after that number of days, perhaps neither distinctly, but both in an</hi> Hermophradite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0541900200:16"/>In a word, They that would be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their Wedlock Actions, and be happy in the fruit of their Labour, must observe to copulate at distance of time, not too often, nor yet too seldom, for <hi>both these</hi> hurt Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness alike; for to eject immoderately weakens a <hi>Man</hi> and wasts his Spirits, and <hi>too often</hi> causes the Seed by long continuance to be ineffectual and not Manly enough. And thus much for the first general and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; from whence I shall proceed to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which is to give the Reader to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>how</hi> the <hi>Child</hi> is formed in the <hi>Womb,</hi> and what Accidents it is incident to, <hi>how,</hi> nourished, and <hi>how</hi> brought forth,</p>
               <p>Certain it is, there are various Opinions concerning this matter: therefore I shall for the satisfaction of the curious, lay down the Opinion of the Learned, as thus, Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of an <hi>Ovum,</hi> or <hi>Eg</hi> impregnated in the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> or <hi>Testieles</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> by the more subtile part of <hi>Man</hi>'s Seed; but there is a forming Faculty and <hi>Virtue</hi> in the <hi>Seed</hi> from a Divine and Heavenly Gift, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly endued with Vital and Etherial Spirit, which gives Shape and Form to the <hi>Embryo</hi>; so that all the parts and bulk of the Body which is made up in the space of many months, and is by Degrees fram'd and form'd into a decent and comely Figure of a Man, do consist in that, and are adumbrated
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0541900200:17"/>
thereby: On which holy <hi>David</hi> contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, fell into his Divine Rapture and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, expressed in <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. <hi>I will praise thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O Lord, because I am wonderfully made: Thy Works are wonderful. My Soul searcheth and knoweth it right well. Thou knowest all my Bones when I was Fashioned in the secret place, and when I was wonderfully formed in my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Womb. Thy Eyes beheld me yet unmade, and in thy Book were all my Members written, which day by day were fashioned. Thy Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is wonderful unto me, whereby I was made, I cannot understand it,</hi> &amp;c. And Physicians that have narrowly contemplated Man's Nature, constitute four different Times, wherein this Microsm, or little World, is framed, and perfected in the Womb.</p>
               <p>The first is immediately after Coition, and is said to be perfected in the first Week, if no Efflux happen, which sometimes fall out through the slipperiness of the Matrix, or the Head thereof that shifts over like a Rose-bud, opening on a sudden, by reason of some cold Distemper, or over-weariness in Travel.</p>
               <p>The second time of forming is constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when Nature, and the force of the Womb, by the use of her own imbred For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Virtue, makes a manifest Mutation in the Conception, so that all the Substance seems Congealed Flesh and Blood, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0541900200:18"/>
happens about the Twelfth and Fourteenth day after Copulation; and though this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, or Fleshly Mass abound with hot fiery Blood, yet it remains undistinguishable without form of Figure, and may be called the rough Draught, or <hi>Embrio,</hi> and well likened to Seed which is sown in the Ground, which through kindly Heat and Moisture, grows up by degrees into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Form, either in Plant or Grain; or as when a <hi>Potter</hi> Fashons a Vessel out of a rude lump of Clay.</p>
               <p>The third time to make up this Fabrick, is set when the principle Parts shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves evidently and perspiciously; as the Heart, from whence proceeds the Arteries; the Brain, from which the Nerves proceed like many small Threads running through the whole Body; and the Liver, whose Office it is to seperate the Bile from the Blood, brought to it by the <hi>Vana Portae.</hi> The two first are the Seeds and Fountains of Life, that nourish and support each part of the Body; in framing which, the Faculty of the Womb is busied from the time of Conception to the Eighteenth Day of the first Month.</p>
               <p>But Lastly, which time reacheth to the 28 or 30th day, the outward parts are seen exquisitely elabourted and distinguished by Joints, and then the Child begins to grow
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0541900200:19"/>
and pant; from which progress of days, by reason the Limbs are divided, and the whole frame is perfect, it is no longer held an imperfect Child or <hi>Embrio,</hi> that is, a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> that springs forth, but is held to be a perfect and absolute <hi>Child. Males</hi> for the most part are perfect by the 30th day, but <hi>Females</hi> seldom, till the 42 or 45 day; and the reason why the one is sooner perfected than the other, is, That the heat of the Womb is greater in producing the <hi>Male</hi> than the <hi>Female</hi>: For heat extends the Humour like soft Wax, diffusing and dilating it, and then by its force, Contracting, Framing, and Fashoning it, so Heat and Vigour of the Body, and Alacrity of Nature in the Man, makes the <hi>Male</hi> to move in 3 Months but the Female rarely under 4, at which time also his Hair and Nails comes forth, and the Child begins to stir, kick and tumble in the Womb; so that the motion is plainly perceived, and the Woman are troubled with <hi>Nauseating</hi> and <hi>Loathing</hi> of their Meat, and oftentimes covet, and greedily long for things contrary to Nutriment; as Coals, Rubbish, Chalk, Lime, Starch, Oat-meal, raw Flesh and Fish, or the like, which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire proceeds from a former contraction of evil Humours, occasioning impure Blood in their contained Vessel within, and often occasions Abortion and Miscarriages; some
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0541900200:20"/>
Women, as it has been noted by divers Authors of Credit, have been so extravagent in their Longings, that they have coveted Hob-Nails, Leather, Man's Flesh, Horse-Flesh, and the Flesh of divers Ravenous Beasts, for want of which they have cast their Birth untimely, or the Child has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Dead in the Womb for many days, to the eminent hazard of the Woman's Life: But to proceed in this great Mystery, I shall unfold by what means the Infant is sustain'd in the Womb, and what posture it there remains in.</p>
               <p>The Disputes among both Philosophers and Physicians, with what, and by what way the <hi>Faetus</hi> is nourished, have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great; some affirming by Blood only, from the <hi>Vmbilical</hi> Vein; others only by Chyle, received in by the Month, but the Truth is, it is nourished diversly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different degrees of Perfection, that an <hi>Ovum,</hi> or Egg passes from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to a <hi>Faetus,</hi> ready for the Birth.</p>
               <p>But before we proceed, it will not be amiss to explain what we mean by this <hi>Ovum,</hi> or Egg. You must know then, that there are in the Generation of the <hi>Faetus</hi> two Principles, Active, and Passive: The Active is the Man's Seed,, which is elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Testicles out of the Arterial Blood, and Animal Spirits. The Passive
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0541900200:21"/>
Principle is an <hi>Ovum,</hi> or Egg, impregnated by the Man's Seed. For to say that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has true Seed, is false, and erroneous. But the manner of Conception is thus; The most Spirituous part of Man's Seed in the Act of Generation, reaching up to the <hi>Ovarium,</hi> or Testicles of the Woman (which contain divers Eggs, sometimes more, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fewer) secundates one of them, which being convey'd by the <hi>Ovi-ducts,</hi> to the bottom of the Womb, presently begins to swell bigger and bigger, and imbibes the moisture that is sent plentifully thither, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner that Seeds in the ground suck the fertile moisture thereof to make them sprout.</p>
               <p>When the parts of the <hi>Embryo</hi> begin to be a little more perfect, and the <hi>Chorion</hi> becomes so thick, that the Liquor cannot soak through it, the <hi>Vmbilical</hi> Vessels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be formed, and to extend the side of the <hi>Amnios,</hi> which they pass through, and also through the <hi>Allantides</hi> and <hi>Chorion</hi> and are implanted in the <hi>Placenta,</hi> which gathering upon the <hi>Chorion,</hi> joyns into the <hi>Vterus.</hi> And now the Arteries that before sent out the nutritious juice into the <hi>Cavity</hi> of the Womb, open by the Orifices into the <hi>Placenta,</hi> where they deposite the said Juice, which is drunk up by the <hi>Vmbilical Vein,</hi> and conveyed by it first to the Liver
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0541900200:22"/>
of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and then to the Heart, where its more thin and spirituous part is turned into Blood, whilst the grosser part of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending by the <hi>Aorta,</hi> enters the <hi>Vmbilical Arteries,</hi> and is discharged into its Cavity by those Branches of them that run through the <hi>Amnios,</hi>

them in vain, and genital Testicles inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, if the <hi>Woman</hi> wanted <hi>Seminal Excres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>; for being Nature doth nothing in vain, therefore it must be granted, that they were made for the Use of Seed and Procreation, and fixed in their proper Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both the Testicles and Receptacles of Seed, whose nature and force is to operate, and afford fruitful virtue to the Seed: and to prove this there needs no stronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (say they) than that, if a Woman do not use Copulation to eject her Seed, she oftentimes falls into strange Diseases, as appears by young Widows and Virgins, A second Reason they urge, That although the Society of a <hi>lawful Bed</hi> consist not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in these things, yet it is apparent, that the Female Sex is not better won and appear more blithe and jocund than when they are often satisfied this way, which is an inducement to believe that they have <hi>greater</hi> Pleasure and receive more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than a Man: For since by Nature much Delight accompanies Ejection by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth of the swelling Spirit, and the stiffness of the Nerves, in which case the Operation of the Woman's Part is double, she suffering both ways, even by <hi>Ejection</hi> and <hi>Reception,</hi> whereby she is more recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and delighted in the <hi>Venereal Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is (they say) that the Child
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0541900200:30"/>
more frequently resembles the <hi>Mother</hi> than the Father, because the <hi>Mother</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the most towards its Generation: And they think it may be further instanced from the great love they bear them; for that besides their contributing <hi>Seminal Matter,</hi> they, during the time they are in the <hi>Womb</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> feed and nourish the <hi>Child</hi> with the <hi>purest Fountain of Blood</hi>; which Opinion <hi>Galen</hi> confirms, by allowing the Child to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate more of the <hi>Mother</hi> than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and refers the Difference of the Sex to the Influence of Menstrual Blood; but the Reason of the Likeness he attributes to the Force of the Seed; for as Plants receive more from fruitful Ground than from the Industry of the Husbandman, so the Infant in more abundance receives from the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> than the Father; for first, the Seed of both is heaped and fostered in the Womb, and there grows to perfection, being nourished with Blood. And hence they will have it that <hi>Children</hi> for the most part <hi>affect</hi> their <hi>Mother</hi> best, for it proceeds from the nearness of Nature by a natural Instinct, because the <hi>Mothers</hi> force was most employed about 'em. For 9 Months, and sometimes 10, she nourisheth the Child with her purest Blood, then her love towards it newly born, and the Likeness do clearly demonstrate, that the Woman
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0541900200:31"/>
affordeth Seed, and that Women do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more towards making the Child than Men. But in all this the <hi>Antients</hi> were very much in an Error, for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticles (so called) in Womem, do not afford any Seed, but are two Eggs, analogous to those of Fowls and other Creatures; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they any such Office as those of Men, but are indeed <hi>Ovarium,</hi> wherein those Eggs are nourished by the sanguinary Vessels dispersed through them, and from whence one or more, (as they are fecundated by the Man's Seed) separated, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the Womb by the <hi>Ovi duces,</hi> The Truth of this is plain; for if you boile them, their liquor will have the same colour, taste, and consistency with the Whites of Birds Eggs; to say they want shells is nothing at all; for the Eggs of Fowls while they are in the <hi>Ovary,</hi> nay, after they have fallen down into the <hi>Vterus,</hi> have no Shell. And though when they are laid they have one, yet that is no more than a Fence which Nature has provided them against outward Injuries, while they are hatched without the Body, whereas those of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being hatced within the Body, need no other Fence than the Womb, by which they are sufficiently guarded.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the clearing of this Point also; and now to the third thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,

                  <hi>viz.</hi> Whence grows the Kind, and whether the Man or the Woman is the Cause of the Male or Female Infant.</p>
               <p>The primal Cause, as justly due in this and all other Cases, we must ascribe to God the Ruler and Disposer of all things, yet many things by his high Sufferance, proceed in regular order, by the Rules of Nature, and are carried on by their in-bred <hi>Motion,</hi> according to their usual and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Course, without Variation, tho' indeed by favour from on high. <hi>Sarah</hi> conceived <hi>Isaac; Hannah, Samuel</hi>; and <hi>Elizabeth, John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>; but these were to fulfil the Almighty's Decree; nor since those times have the Prayers of the righteous been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful in obtaining Children; but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing over such Supernatural and Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Causes that have their peculiar Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I shall proceed to speak of things natural and common. The Antient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians and Philosophers say, That since there are two Principles, out of which the Body of Man is made, and which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Child like the Progenitors, and to be of one or the other Sex, <hi>viz.</hi> Seed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both Sexes, and menstrual Blood proper to the Woman only: The Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude (say they) must needs consist in the Force of the Male or Female Seed, so that it proves like to the one or the other, as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0541900200:33"/>
more or less Plenty is afforded by either, but that the difference of Sex is not referr'd to the Seed, but to the Menstrual Blood, which is proper to the Woman; for were that force (say they) altogether retained in the Seed, the Man's Seed being of a hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quality than the Woman's, Male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren would be superabundant, and none of the other Sex (or very rarely) would be propagated, whereof the kind of the Creature is attributed to the Temperament of the <hi>active qualities,</hi> which consist in Heat and cold, and to the substances or nature of the Matter under them, that is, to the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Menstrual Blood: Now the Seed (say they) affords both Force to procreate and form the Child, and Matter for its Generation, and that in the menstrual Blood there is both Matter and Force; for as the Seeds most helps the material Principles, so likewise the menstrual Blood, the potential Seed, is (saith <hi>Galen</hi>) Blood well conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Vessels that contain it, so that Blood is not only the Matter of generating the Child, but also Seed, in possibility that Menstrual Blood hath both Principles, as Matter and Faculty of offering. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> say further, That the Seed is not the strongest Effi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ent, the Matter of it being very little in quantity, but that the poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or efficient Faculty of it is very feeble:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0541900200:34"/>
Wherefore if the material part or Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciple of Generation, according to which the Sex is made, were only (say they) in the menstrual Blood, then would the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be all, or mostly Females, as if the efficient force was in the Seed, they would be all Males; but that since both have Operation in menstrual Blood, Matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominates in quantity, and in the Seeds Force and Virtue. Deservedly (saith <hi>Galen</hi>) the Child receives its Sex rather from the Mother than from the Father, although his Seed do contribute something to the material Principles, though more weakly. But as for Similitude, although Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (say the <hi>Antients</hi>) be of extraordinary Force, it is referred rather to the Father than the Mother, as to the Quality of the Seed, at, or for a short time after Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but continues not long so to do, for that the Woman's Seed receiving Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the menstrual Blood, for the space of Nine Months, over-powers the Man's as to that Particular, because the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strual Blood flowing into the Vessels, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cherishes and augments the one than the other; from which it may be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily conjectur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0541900200:35"/>
for the Man's by Reason of the moisture and thinness of it, being more fit to frame and make up Conception thereby; for as with soft Wax and moist Clay, the Workman can frame what he intends, so (say they) the Man's Seed mixing with the Woman's, as also with the Menstrual Blood, helps effectually to make the form and perfect Part of Man; but (with all the Respect and Difference imaginable to the Wisdom of the <hi>Ancients</hi>) we must needs say, that their Ignorance in Anatomy has led them into many and great mistakes; and their <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Formation of the <hi>Embryo,</hi> from a Commixture of Seeds, and the Nutrition of it from the menstruous Blood being altogether false, their Opinion in this Case must needs be false also.</p>
               <p>Therefore (to conclude this Chapter) we say, <hi>That although a strong Imagination of the Mother may sometimes determine the Sex, (that is, make it Male or Female, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as her Imagination is) yet the main A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in this Case is the Plastick or Formative Principle, which is the Efficient in Forming the Child, that gives it this or that Sex, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those Laws and Rules that are prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to it by the wise Creator of all things.</hi>

the Almighty, immediatly proceeding from him, nor passing from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as fondly and absurdly the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> have insinuated in their Opinions about the Transmigration of the Soul; and so vain were they that they did not only imagine the Souls of the deceased Men passed into new-born Infants, but into Beasts also; and from thence it was they forbid the eating of Flesh, and abstained themselves from so doing, lest, as they fondly fansied, they might (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> records it) eat their Grandfather in a Calf. But such frivolous and superstitious Notions are to be rejected by Christians, and those true ones obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which are both reasonable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to humane Capacities: For <hi>Orthodox Divines</hi> conclude in general, that the Soul is given to any Infant by Infusion, when he or she is perfected in the Womb, which happens about the 45th Day after Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, especially for Males that in likelyhood will be born at the end of Nine Months, but in Femals, who are of a weaker Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and not so soon formed and be perfected thro' the defect of Heat) not till the 50th Day.</p>
               <p>And altho this Day in all cases cannot be <hi>perfectly</hi> set down, yet <hi>Hypocrates</hi> has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to give his absolute Opinion, when the Child has its perfect form, whom

it begins to move, and when born, if in due Season; for in his Book of the Nature of Infants, he affirmeth, That if it be a Male, and he be perfect on the thirtieth day, and move at the sixtieth, he will come forth at the Seventh Month; but if he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly formed on the 35<hi>th</hi> day, he will move on the 70<hi>th,</hi> and be born in the 8<hi>th Month.</hi> Again, if he be perfectly formed on the 45<hi>th</hi> day he will move on the 90<hi>th</hi> day, and be born in the <hi>Ninth Month.</hi> Now from these passing of Days and <hi>Months,</hi> it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears that the day of Forming being doubled makes up the day of moving; and that day three times reckoned makes up the day of Birth.</p>
               <p>As for Example, where 35 perfect the Form, if you double it, it makes 70; the day of Motion, and three times 70 amounts to 210 Days or 7 Months, allowing 30 Days to one Month, and so you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the rest: But as for the Female, it is longer perfecting in the Womb, and the <hi>Mother</hi> ever goes longer with a Boy than a Girl, so that there is difference in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt; for a Female formed in 30 Days moves not till the 70 day, and is born in the 7 Month; when she is formed in the 40 day she moves not till the 80 day, and is born in the 8 Month; but if she be perfectly formed on the 45 Day, she moves on the 90, and

And as the Body is more and more capable of receiving its Influence, so it shews it self in its proper Lustre, having force and endowments at the time it enters the former Child in the Womb, for the substance of it can receive nothing less: and thus much to prove that the Soul comes not from the Parents, but is infused by God.

               <p>So the <hi>Low-Countrey</hi> Women especially those living near the Sea-side, being rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and troubled in Copulation, bring forth mishapen <hi>Embroy's,</hi> or rude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Burthens, not only without moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but some that pant, and are alive, and these most commonly happen in case of Sailors, or Mariners who coming home, rashly Marry, or run upon their Wives without any due regard to their Menstrual Flux, or the Wombs cleansing it self to the Season of the Year, or the Moon, or Sun's Progress through the Coelestial Signs; not are the Women without regard to the Health or Shape of their Posterity, less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to receive them, after a long separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is not only exceeding hurtful to themselves, from thence proceed not monstrous and untimely Births only, but dangerous Diseases often, to those who rashly proceed. The first (say the <hi>Antiants</hi>) is because the Seed mixing with Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Blood, contract an unnatural Mass of corrupt Matter, which either turns to Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrage, Abortion, or a Monstrous and Deformed Birth; for by that means the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Womb (say they) loseth its

               <p>Our Women, because Conception begins in the forth Moon, when the <hi>Menses</hi> flow down by force, and that Planet in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, call it a Moon-birth, or many kinds. And some are of Opinion that this Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation may be made without the help of a Man, by force of Imagination, in those that are extreamly Lascivious; for that by often feeling, and touching their Husbands, at the same time strongly fancying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Act, their Seed flows to the Blood, and is by the Heat of the Womb formed into a foul Mass, but arrives at no perfection. And to the same purpose is it when Men strive against the Stream; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Copulation in the forth and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Moon, and in the forth day of its Conjunction; for then not observing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Rules, he either loseth his labour, or Generates a monstrous Birth, or if it chance, which is almost next to a miracle to be perfect, it is by the <hi>Latins</hi> called a

whence they had their Name, after this a Monster came forth of her Womb, with a crooked Back, long round Neck, and fiery Eyes, and a pointed Tail, being very nimble-footed; for as soon as it came forth it gave the affrighted Midwife the slip, and run up and down the Room to seek a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place, till at last, one Woman more couragious than the rest, fell upon it with a Cushion and smothered it: This Monster had sucked the Blood from the Child, which came forth after it, being a Male, and so eaten the Flesh, that it scarcely lived to be Christned; nor could the Woman be in a long time restored to her Strength: And farther adds, that upon his Enquiry, she told him, that it had proceeded (as she thought) from unreasonable, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and insatiate Venery: <hi>Hereupon</hi> (says he) <hi>I prescribed her a wholsom Course of Life, and Medicines to restore her Forces; for she was become wonderful Lean.</hi>

               <p>There are indeed amongst the number of Men and Women, that tread the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restial Globe, divers that are monstrously deformed, and of horrid Aspect, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storted Jaws, and Goggle-Eyes, and many other marks of Deformity; but these tho' by their Parents rashness in indecent or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable Copulation or the Defect of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being thus disordered, yet are they referred to the number of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, because they speak, understand and act, which demonstrate them to have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Souls; and therefore shall they stand upon the Earth at the last Day, and at the <hi>Resurruction</hi> all Deformity shall be done away, and they shall appear in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Shape, and the Organical Parts ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>IF any be desirous to enter into the Holy State of Matrimony, let them observe their Ability and Constitution of Body, and not run themselves rashly upon Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies; for those who marry too young may rightly be termed to marry unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; not considering their Inability; nor examining the Force of Nature; as divers there are, before they are ripe for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation

of so weighty a matter, who either rashly of their own accords, (by the instigation of Bawds. Procures, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-brokers, or forced thereto by their Parents, who covet a larg Dowrey) take upon them this Yoke, to their great Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: <hi>Lavinus Lemnius</hi> says, That he has known some of them who before the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a year, have been thereby so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled and weakned, that all their vital Moisture was exausted; so that he was upon their applying themselves to him, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged with Medicaments to restore their Strength that was fallen, and sunk down wherefore his advice is, That it is no way convenient to suffer Children, or such as are not of Age to mary, or get Children: But whosoever proposes to marry, must chieft observe this, that he choose one to his Companion and Partner in his Felicity, that is of an honest Stock and proceeding from temperate Parents. though her Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be not so large as he could wish; that he observe the Conversation, and find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that she is chaste, well bred, and of good manners. For a woman, (as the <hi>Comedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> saith) if she hath good Conditions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she has Portion enough. That of <hi>Alcamena</hi> in <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> is a witty saying; which all Maids and others of the Female Sex, should retain shew in remembrance: I do not think

(saith she) that to be my Dowry, which is called so: But Chastity, Modesty, and a setled desire to fear God, to love my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and agree with my Kindred; to obey my Husband, to be bountiful, and to do good to such as are Virtuous and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. Now, if she proved as good as she promised, such a Wife was to be valued above the Price of Rubies.</p>
               <p>'Tis Duty incombent upon Parents, to be careful in bringing up their Children in the way of Virtue, and have ever a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they fully not their Honour and Reputation, especially the Females, and most of all Virgins, when they grow up to be marriageble; for if through the unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral severity of rigid Parents they be crossed and frustrated in their love, many of them, out of a mad humour, if temptations lie in their way, throw themselves into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste Arms of a subtle charming Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; being through ahe softness of good Nature, and strong Desire, to pursue their Appetites, easily induced to believe Men's Flatteries, and feigned Vows of promised Marriage, to cover the shame; and then too late the Parents find the effects of their rash Severity, which brought a lasting stain upon their Family. Now, as 'tis an Error in marrying too young, so it is unequality of Mariage between Age and Youth, as a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0541900200:68"/>
young Man, who to make his Fortune, marries to a Woman, that for Age might be his Grand-mother, between whom, for the most part Jealousies and Discontents happen; nor is it possible such Women should have Children, be the Man never so sprightly and young, The like may be said, though with a little more excuse, when an old doting Fellow marries a young Virgin, in the Summer Season of her youth and Vigour, who whilst he strives and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strains to please her, is the sooner wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Grave. For, as in Child-hood, or green Youth, 'tis unfit and unreasonable to think of Marriage, so in old Age to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unequal, is altogether the same; for they that enter upon it too soon, are soon exhausted, and fall into Consumption, and divers other Diseases; and those that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crastinate and marry unseemly, fall into the like ill conveniences on the other side, having only the Honour to be dubbed a Knight of the Forked Order, and have their Names inrolled in the Collony of Cuckoldom; especially if their Wives have not been trained up in the Paths of Virtue, and lie to much open to Importunity and Temptation of lewd and debanched Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus much for Errors or Over-sights in rash, and unseasonable preposterous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>

               <p>THE former of these Inconveniences is too apparent in Virgins, especially such as are of a Flegmatick Complection, evidently shewing it self by discolouring the Face, in making it look Green, Pale, or of a dusky Yellow, which proceeds from raw undigested Humours, nor only doth it appear to the Eye, but sensibly afflicts such as it possesses, with difficulty of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Pains in the Head, Palpitations of the Heart. unusual beatings, and small throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Arteries in the Temples, Neck and Back, many times casting them into Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, if the Humour be very vitious, also loathing of Meat, and the distension of the Hypocondriack Part, by reason of the Inordinate Efflux of the <hi>Menstruous Blood</hi> to the greater Vessels, and by reason of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Humour, the whole Body is often troubled with swelling, or if not, at least the Thighs, Legs, and Ankles, all

one or other violent Distemper; I shall somewhat largely treat thereof.</p>
               <p>Sterility proceeds from divers Causes, but most commonly from some Defect in the Organs of Generation. Upon the Woman's Part it most commonly happens from the strict Closure of the Mouth of the <hi>Womb,</hi> which will not admit the Seed, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the straitness of the Share-bone, which denies Entrance to the <hi>Penis</hi>; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also from Ulcers or Exorescences in the Neck of the <hi>Womb.</hi> To these may be added too much Fatness, which straitens the Passage of the <hi>Matrix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Most of the Antients are of Opinion, that Conception is hindered commonly by the Humidity and Moisture of the Womb, when by reason thereof it cannot retain the Seed, or by bad Humours heaped up there, and corrupting it, or strange Defect of the <hi>Menstruous</hi> Blood. But certain it is, that it proceeds, either from some Tumour, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Excrescence, or by some faults or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Womb, Ovaria,</hi>, or <hi>Oviducts</hi>: For if the Eggs are not impregnated with the <hi>Aura virilis,</hi> or Seminal Spirits, there can be no Conception, the Testicles of Women having no such Office as those of Men, but containing Eggs analogous to those of Fowl and other Creatures.</p>

               <p>LET her that undertakes this Office attended with many Circumstances of Danger and Disgrace, take good heed to what I shall relate. In the first place, let her be diligent to leave nothing unsearched, which may be advantagious to her <hi>Practice,</hi> never imagining her self so perfect but she may add to her Knowledge by Study and Experience; yet never let her apply any Remedies in that Case, unless she has try'd them, or known them try'd with Success, or at least is conscious of their Force, that they will do no harm, doing nothing in that nature to practice upon Poor or Rich, but speaking freely of what she knows, and giving Reason for the further Confirmation thereof, by no means daring to give directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for such Medicine as will cause Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to pleasure those that have unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceived, which to do, is a high degree of wickedness, and may be ranked with Murther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if any come to her with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pretences, let her send them to able Physicians, and neither for fair Words nor

She must likewise observe that she enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no great-belly'd Women at Bed and Board in her House, lest thereby she bring a Scandal upon her self, and so lose her Practice.

Reception of the Child to be in a readiness; and above all let her use her diligence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by perswasion or otherwise, to keep the Woman from being unruly in her Pangs, lest thereby she destroy both her self and her Child, and not in any wise to proceed too hastily in her Business, but wait God's leisure in all things, and by no means let her suffer her Wits to scatter by dismay or doubt, if things go not well, for fear it disorders the Senses, and a Person that keeps her Wits together, is capable of giving Assistance in weighty Affairs, for when we are most at a Plunge, then there is most need of Prudence to set things right. And seeing she can never be an expert Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife that has no farther Knowledge than of the external Parts, I shall not think it amiss, briefly with modesty to proceed in describing the generative Part of a Woman; as they have been anatomized by the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the present and past Ages, and shew the Use of such Vessels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as are contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting Generation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Action and Use of the Neck of the Womb is also equal with that of the <hi>Penis, viz.</hi> Erection, occasioned divers ways. First, in case of Copulation, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and made strait for the Passage of the <hi>Penis</hi> to the Womb. Secondly, Whilst
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0541900200:116"/>
the Passage is repleated with Spirit and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Blood,</hi> it becomes more strait for embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Penis,</hi> as for the Convenience of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it is twofold; <hi>First,</hi> Forasmuch as if the <hi>Neek</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> was not erected, the <hi>Yard</hi> could have no convenient Passage to the <hi>Womb. Secondly,</hi> It hinders any hurt or damage that might ensue through the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Concussion of the <hi>Yard</hi> during the time of <hi>Copulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Vessels that pass thro' the <hi>Neck</hi> of the Womb, their Office is to repleat it with <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that still as the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture consumes the Heat contracted there in <hi>Copulation,</hi> it may by those Vessels be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. But their principal Business is to convey Nutriment to the Womb.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Womb</hi> it self has many Properties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to it, as <hi>First,</hi> Retention of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundated Egg, which is properly called <hi>Conception.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To cherish and nourish it, til by the help of Nature, it has framed the Child, and brought it to Perfection. And then it strongly operates in sending forth the Birth when the time of its remaining there is expired, dilating and spreading it self in a wonderful Manner: And indeed is the Field of Man's Generation, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for no other Purpose, and so aptly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0541900200:117"/>
removed from the Senses, that nothing of Injury can proceed from thence, retaining in it self a Power and Strength to operate and cast forth the Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, unless by Accident or the like it be rendred deficient. When to strengthen and enable it, besides the Helps of Nature, sundry Remedies are to be applied by skilful Hands Direction. For which shall be hereafter mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Use of the preparing Vessels is this: The Arteries convey the <hi>Blood</hi> to the <hi>Testicles,</hi> where part of it is spent in the nourishment of them, and the Production of those little Bladders (which do in all things resemble Eggs) through which the <hi>Vasa Praeparantia</hi> run, and are obliterate in them. And as for the Veins, their Office is only to bring back what <hi>Blood</hi> remains from the uses aforesaid.</p>
               <p>The Vessels in this kind are much shorter in Women than in Men, by reason of their <hi>nearness</hi> to the <hi>Stones,</hi> which Defect is yet legthenned and made good by the many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacies or Windings, to which those Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels are subject, for in the middle Way they drive themselves into two Branches, tho' different in Magnitude, for one being grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the other, passes by the Stone.</p>
               <p>The Stones in a Woman are very useful for when they are defective, Generation

is at an end; for altho' those little Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are on their outward Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, contain nothing of Seed, as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hipocrates</hi> did erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neously imagine, yet they contain several Eggs commonly to the number of twenty in each Testicle) one of which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by the most spirituous part of the Man's Seed in the Act of Coition, descends through the <hi>Ovi-ducts</hi> into the Womb, and from thence, in process of time becomes a living Child.</p>
               <p>Their Figure is not exactly round, but flat and dispersed on the sides; in their low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part Oval, but in their upper, where the Blood-Vessels enter them, more plain; and have but one Membrane to encompass 'em, probably that the Heat may have the easier Access.</p>

               <p>The Watry Mole is known by its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stention of the Belly, and especially, when she lies upon her Back, the sides thereof are more swelled than the middle, or the bottom which grows flatter by reason the watry humour falls to the sides, moving up and down, as if it were a fluctuation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THese Instructions being exceeding neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, I thought fit to lay them down for a Rule to such as are desirous of Self-preservation. And indeed, for want of due Observance, divers Diseases afflict Child-bearing Women, nay, the Child is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost, or, if it come to a perfect Birth, proves sickly and disordered through the Mother's Misobservance.</p>
               <p>In the first place then, the <hi>Woman</hi> with Child ought to chuse a temperate Air, not affected with Fogs arising from Marshes, Ditches, Ponds, Lakes or Rivers, and not to go abroad in too hot; nor too cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor when the <hi>South-wind</hi> blows <hi>strong</hi>; for that Wind, above all others, dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

causing Abortion: And next to it the <hi>North-wind</hi> is hurtful, causing <hi>Catarrhs, Coughs</hi> and <hi>Rheums,</hi> which; opening the Body, causes the <hi>Woman</hi> to bring forth before her time. In short, if any evil Vapour be drawn in during Purgancy, it causes divers Diseases.</p>
               <p>In case of Diet, she ought to be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in chusing such Meats as create whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som nourishment, all Meats that are mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately dry, being taken so to do; and let her observe not to fast immoderately; for that renders the Child sickly and weak, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for want of nourishment, constrains it to be born before its time; nor on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand must she be too gluttonous, for that again stuffs it, and causes it to swell beyond its natural Bounds.</p>
               <p>All Meats, either too hot or too cold, and moist, are to be avoided, as Salads, Spiced meats, and the extraordinary Use of other Meats, which makes the Children come forth oftentimes without Nails, which is a Sign of short Life. The most wholsom Meats in this case are Pidgeons, Turtles, Larks, Partridges, Pheasants, Veal Mutton, or any such Meat that is of good Juice, and contributing to kindly Nourishment; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so such Fruits as are sweet and of easy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, as <hi>Cherries, Pears, Damsons,</hi> &amp;c. but let her avoid such things as subject her Body to Windiness.</p>

                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0541900200:131"/>Her Longings if extravagant she must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain, at least as much as in her lies, not eating any thing that is filthy or contrary to Nourishment, nor let her sleep imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Meals, and not at all in the Day-time if she can avoid it; the Night being preferable in such cases when she may sleep her fill, so it exceed not nine hours.</p>
               <p>Her Exercise ought to be moderate, for <hi>violent motion,</hi> either in Walking or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>molests</hi> and <hi>disturbs</hi> the <hi>Womb,</hi> Riding in a Coach, especially upon the Stones or in uneven Way (the last three Months are dangerous) as also extraordinary Sounds or Noises, and above all, the Ringing of Bells, and Discharging of Guns.</p>
               <p>Laughing, Crying, or immoderate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or any other Passion is extreamly hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; nor in the first four Months after <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> ought she to lie with her Husband, forasmuch as the Act of <hi>Copulation</hi> moves and shakes the <hi>Womb,</hi> and consequently the Fruit therein, and causes the Courses to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend.

               <p>Having thus provided, when the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man feels her Pains come, if the Weather be not extream cold, let her walk leisurely
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0541900200:136"/>
about the <hi>Room,</hi> resting her self by turns upon the Bed, expecting so the coming down of her Water, which is a Humour that is contracted in one of the outward Membranes and flows thence when it is broke by the struggling of the Child, or some other Accident, there being no <hi>direct time</hi> affixed for its Efflux, though for the most part it flows not above two hours before the Birth. Motion likewise will cause the Womb to open and dilate it self, when ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along in Bed will prove troublesome, yet if she be much spent and weakened, she may take some gentle Cordial to refresh her self, if her Pains will Permit.</p>
               <p>If her Travel be tedious, to revive her Spirits, she may take any <hi>Broth of Chickens</hi> or <hi>Mutton,</hi> and after it a poach'd Egg, but must not take any thing to excess. As for the Posture Women are delivered in, they are divers; <hi>some</hi> lying in their Bed, <hi>others</hi> siting in a Chair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> supported and held by others, or resting upon the side of the Bed or Chair; <hi>some again</hi> upon their Knees, being supported under their Arms; but the <hi>safest</hi> and <hi>most cemmodious</hi> Way is in the Bed, whenas the <hi>Midwife</hi> ought to observe these following Rules:</p>
               <p>Let her see that the Woman be laid upon her Back, her Head a little elevated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the help of a Pillow, having the like
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0541900200:137"/>
help to support her Reins and Buttocks, and that her Rump lie high; for if she lie low, she cannat be well delivered; then let her keep her <hi>Knees</hi> and <hi>Thighs</hi> as far asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as she can, her Legs bowed together, her Buttocks, the Soles of her Feet and Heels being fix'd upon a little Log of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, placed for that purpose, that she may have the greater Force to strain: Now in case her <hi>Back</hi> be <hi>exceeding weak,</hi> a Swath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band may be cast under it, the Band being four double, and about 12 Inches broad, and this must be held by two Persons, who with steady hands and equal motion must raise her up at the time the Pains happen; but if they be not exact in their Motion, 'tis better evaded, and at the same time let two Women hold her Shoulders that she may the better strain out the Birth with more Advantage; and the better to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it, let a Woman stroak or press the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Part of her Belly gently, and by degrees. Nor must the Woman her self be faint-hearted, but couragious, and of a good Heart; forcing her self by straining and stopping her Breath.</p>
               <p>In case of Delivery, the Midwife must wait with Patience till the Child's Head or other Members burst the Membrane; for through Ignorance, or haste to be gone to other Women, as some have done, the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0541900200:138"/>
Midwife tear the Membranes with her Nails, she endangers both the Woman and the Child; for it lying dry, and wanting that Slipperiness that should facilitate it, its Egress comes forth with greater Pain.</p>
               <p>When the Head appears, the Midwife must gently hold it between her two hands, and draw the Child at such times as the Womans Pangs are upon her, and at no other, slipping by degrees her four fingers under its Armpits, not using a ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gh hand in drawing it forth, lest by such means the Child, through its tenderness, receive any Deformity of Body.</p>
               <p>As <hi>soon</hi> as the Child is taken forth, which is commonly with its Face downwards, let it be laid upon its Back, that it may more freely receive External Respiration; then cut the Navel-string with a sharp Instrument about three Inches from the Body, tying that which adheres to the Belly, with a silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en string, as near as you can, then cover the Head and Stomach of the Child well, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering nothing to come upon the Face.</p>
               <p>The Child being thus drawn forth, and in Health, lay it aside, and let the Midwife regard the Patient, in drawing, or causing to come forth the Secundine: And this may be done by wagging and stirring them up and down, and afterwards with a gentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0541900200:139"/>
be difficult, let the Woman hold Salt in her Hands, shut them close, and breath hard into them, whereby she shall know whether the said Membranes be broken or not: The like may be known by causing a Strain or Vomiting, by putting one Finger down her Throat, by straining or moving her inferiour Parts, being all observed to be done out of Hand. If this fail she may take a draught of raw Elder-water, or the Yolk of a raw Egg, or smell to a piece of <hi>Assa foetida,</hi> if she be troubled with the Wind-Cholick, a Remedy for which, I shall hereafter prescribe. If she have taken cold, it is a great Obstruction to the coming down of the Secundines; and in such cases the Midwife ought to chafe the Woman's Belly with a gentle Hand, which breaks not only the Wind, but obliges the Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines to come down. And these proving ineffectual, the Midwife must dilate with her Hand the exterior Orince of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN case of Extremity, greater Regard must be had than at other times; and first of all, the Situation of the Womb, and her Posture of Lying must be cross the Bed, being held by such as have Strength to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her slipping down, or moving her self in the Operation of the Man-midwife or Chirurgeon; her Thighs must be sundered as wide as may be, and so held, whilst her Legs invert and bend backward towards her Hips, her Head leaning upon a Bolster, and the Reins of her Back supported with the like, her Rump and Buttocks likewise elevated, observing to cover her Stomach, Belly and Thighs with warm Linnen, to keep them from cold Wind.</p>
               <p>The Woman being in the Posture afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, let the Operator put up his Hand, if he finds the Neck of the Womb dilated, and remove the contracted Blood that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs the Passage of the Birth, and having by degrees, with much gentleness made Way, let him tenderly move the Infant,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0541900200:141"/>
his Head being first anointed with sweet Butter, or a harmless <hi>Pomatum,</hi> and if the Waters are not come down, then without any difficulty may they be let forth, when if the Infant attempts to break forth with the Head foremost or cross, he may gently turn it to find the Feet, which having done, let him draw forth one, and fasten it to a Ribband, then put it up again and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees find the other, when bringing them as close and as even as may be, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whiles giving the Woman leave to breathe, urging her to strain in helping Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to perfect the Birth, he may draw it forth: and the better to do it, that his hold may be surer, he must fasten or wrap a Linnen-Cloth about the Child's Thighs, observing to bring it into the World with its Face downward.</p>
               <p>In case of a Flux of <hi>Blood,</hi> if the Neck of the Womb be open, it must then be mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, whether the Infant or the Secundines come first, which often the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happening to do, stop the Mouth of the <hi>Womb,</hi> and hinder the Birth, to the endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering both the Woman and Child; in such a case, I say, the Secundine must be be removed by swift turn, and indeed they have by their so coming down deceived many, who feeling their Softness, supposed the Womb was not dilated, and by their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0541900200:142"/>
being so deceived, the Woman and Child, or at least the latter has been lost, the Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines removed, the Child must be sought for and drawn forth as has been directed; and if in such a case the Woman or Child die, the Midwife or Chirurgeon is blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, because they did their true Endeavour.</p>
               <p>If it appear, upon <hi>Enquiry,</hi> that the <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> comes first, let the Woman be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all convenient Expedition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause great flux of Blood will follow, for then the Veins are opened, and upon this Account, two things are to be considered. <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>bigness</hi> or <hi>smallness</hi> of the <hi>Secundines</hi> advancing; if the former, and the Head of the Child appear first, it must be guided and directed towards the Neck of the Womb, as in Case of Natural Births, but if there, thro' the Weakness of the Child or Mother, appear any Difficulty in the Delivery, the best Way is to search for the Feet, and thereby draw it forth; but if the latter, the <hi>Secundines</hi> may be put back with a gentle Hand, and the Child first taken forth,</p>
               <p>Another matter is more worthy, <hi>viz</hi> If the <hi>Secundine</hi> be far advanced, so that it cannot be put back, and the Child follow it close, then are the <hi>Seundines</hi> to be taken forth with much Care, as swift as may be, and laid aside, without cutting the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail that is fastned to them, for by that you
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0541900200:143"/>
may be guided to the Infant, the which, whether alive or dead, must be drawn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t is not to be acted unless in case of great Necessity, for in other cases the Secundine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in all single Births: And the same may be observed in case of Twins or Treble Births, for as the single Birth has but one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way and many unnatural Forms even so it happens with the Birth of many Children; wherefore the Midwife must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve (if Twins be in the Womb and press foreward according to the natural Form) that she receive that first which is nearest the passage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not letting the other go, lest by retiring, it should chang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the Birth of Twins, let the Midwife be exceeding careful that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundines be naturally brought forth, lest in such a case, the Womb being delivered of its burthen, falls, and by its so doing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundines continue there longer than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, to the indangering of the Woman.</p>
               <p>If it so happen, that the Woman is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Twins, and one come naturally, and the other unnaturally, as the one with the Head, the other with the Feet foremost, then must the Midwife consider to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Natural-Birth first, and then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

she cannot turn the other, draw it out in the posture it presses forward, but if that with the Feet downwards, be much before the other, then may she deliver that first, turning the Head on the other side.</p>
               <p>In this case the Midwife must be diligent to search that instead of Twins, it be not a Monstrous Birth; as a Body with two Heads, or two bodies Joined together, which she may observe, if both the Hands come foremost, by putting up her Hands betwen them as high as she can and if she find they are Twins, she must gently put one of them aside, to make way for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, taking at first that which is most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, having regard to the other, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he change not its situation.</p>
               <p>Now to prevent the first Child's being in danger of its Life, the Midwife, as soon as 'tis come forth, must tye the Navel-string, as has been before directed, and also bind it again, with a long and large Fillet to that part of the Navel, that is fastned to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundines, the more readily to find them.</p>
               <p>The second Infant born, let her dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently inquire whether there be not two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundines, for by the shortness of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it often happens that it retires back, to the damage of the Woman: wherefore least in such a case the Womb should close it is most expedient to hasten them forth with all convenient speed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0541900200:154"/>if two Infants are joyned togather by the Body, as sometimes monstrously falls out, then although the Heads come fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, yet it is convenient, if possible to turn, them, and draw them forth by the Feet, observing when they come to the Hips, to draw them forth as swift as may be: and in this case great care ought to be observed in anointing and widening the Passage.</p>
               <p>And thus much for extremity or Unnatural Births. And the next thing I shall proceed to, is how to order the Woman after Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Unnatural Births, or Delivery.</p>

               <p>PResently after Delivery, in case of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Birth, especially if the Woman has had hard labour, it is convenient to wrap her in the Skin of a Sheep taken off before it is cold, putting the flesh side to her Reens and Belly, or for want of this the Skin of a Hare, or Coney, being flayed off as soon as killed, may be applied to her Belly: and in so doing the dilation made in the Birth will be closed up, and the melancoly Blood, expelled from those parts; And these may be contributed

               <p>
                  <hi>A while after Delivery you may make a restrictive of the Yolk of two Eggs, and a quartter of a point of White Wine, an Ounce of Oyl of</hi> Saint John's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, <hi>as much of the Oyl of Roses,

Plantain and Rose-water, of each One Ounce, bray them together, fold a Linnen cloath, and dip it therein, warm it before a gentle Fire, and apply it to the Breast, and the pains of those parts will be greatly</hi> eased.</p>
               <p>Present sleep is not convenient, but about four hours after Delivery, she may take Broath, Candle or what other liquid matter is nourishing, and afterwards if she be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to sleep, it may be safely permitted, And this is as much in case of a Natural Birth, as ought immediately to be done.</p>
               <p>In case of Extremity or an unnatural Birth, these Rules ought to be observed: In the fii<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0541900200:157"/>
wherefore it is requisite, for the first five days especially, that she take moderately Panado, Broath, Poach'd Eggs, Gelly of Chickens, or Calves Feet, French Barly-Broath, each day somewhat increasing her allowance; if she intend to be a Nurse to her Child, she may take a little more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to increase the Milk by degrees which must be of no continuance, but drawn off, either by the Child, or otherwise. In this case likewise, let her have Coriander or Fennel-Seeds, boiled in her barly-broath; but by any means, for the time specified let her abstain from Meat. If no Fever trouble her, she may drink now and then a small quantity of White-wine or Claret as also Syrup of Maiden-hair, or other Syrup that is Astringent, taking it in a little water well boiled: And after the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of a Fever, or fear of contraction of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the Breast, she may be nourished more plentifully with the Broath of Pullets, Capons, Pidgeons, Mutton, Veal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which must not be till after eight days, from the day of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The Infant being thus well anointed, or supplied, and well dried, wrap it up warm, and give it a spoonful of Suger and Molla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, or a scruple of Mithridate or Venice-Treacle, dissolved in half a spoonfull of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and after it a lettle Cardus-water, observing to bathe or anoint it each morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as aforesaid. If the Child have extream throws immediately after it comes into the World, it must be rubbed with Juice of Pellitry or the Decoction unto which fresh
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0541900200:160"/>
Butter is melted, or for want of that Spinage-Juice, with Hogs Grease applied to the Navel, with new layed Eggs, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or cemented with Nut Oyl, laying them likewise to the Navel; or you may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister a Clyster made with milk, the Yolk of an Egg, and a small quantity of Sugar, which will undoubtedly ease the Pain.</p>

But what is more to be regarded than any other thing, is the chusing a good Nurse, for upon that choice depends the thriving or not thriving of the Child, and in such Cases these things ought to be regarded, <hi>viz.</hi> Observe that she be not dull sighted, squint-eyed, have down cast looks; that she be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive, or subject to Fits, that her Breath is pure, that no noisom Vapour be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Lungs of the Child, that she be not infected with Bloaches, Boyls Blains, or that she or her Husband never were afflicted with the <hi>French Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,</hi> that she is not given to excessive Drinking, or Gluttony, nor in the least subject to Epilepsie or falling Evil. For the Nurse being in a manner the second Mother to the Child, it drawing from her good or evil humours, especial care must therefore be taken that the Nurse be good conditioned, moderate in meat and drink, wakeful and vigilant, not fretful nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to passion, that her Milk be clean and

the knowledge of this must extend to the Woman for many Reasons. First, that she may prepare and dispose of her self for so great a task. Second, for that at such a time divers Maladies are incident to her, nor can their Cause be penetrated into, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less those things be well known, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now one thing necessary the better to enable the Woman to understand it, is the time of Natural Courses, for in case she have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, or by not rightly understandeng their natural Efflux, or is puzzled therein by reason of some unnatural Retention or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Evacuation, she may rectify her Judgment by these Directions, <hi>viz.</hi> From the Age of 14 to 21, Women have their courses according to the most natural cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the new Moon; from 21 to 30 in the first Quarter; from 30 to 37 or 38 in the Full Moon: and from that time to the time they cease in the last Quarter.</p>
               <p>Beside what is before-mentioned she will be made sensible of the approaching time by pain in her Groin, Thighs, the small of her Back, the lower part of her Navel, together with swelling and hardness in the said pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, shivering and quaking throut the Body, as if possessed with an Ague, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly after with flushing Heat, Feebleness and Lassitude, sm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

will be in a manner restless, she shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Child move downward with more force than ordinary, and a bloody water will distill from the inferiour parts, in case of these Fore-runners, she may be assured her time is at hand, when as she must not delay sending for her Midwife whose Office tis to order her to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, directions for which I have already given, for wonderful it is that Nature has so well ordred her works that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix opens not unless upon some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Casualty, before the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perfixd and not till then do these Signs appear. But appearing they ought to be much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, if the Woman desires her own safety and the preservation of the Child.</p>
               <p>In case the Woman be subject to Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, or to come before her time, let her take Mint, Roses Marjorum, of each a small handful bruise them together, put them in a bag flat, and hang it about the Womans Neck, so that it might reach to the pit of her Stomach, and it will draw the Womb upwards, or keep it in its place that it shall not fall down, or give the Child occasion to seek for an untimely passage.</p>

               <p>THE inflamation in the Breast is no other than the hard Swelling accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a shooting pain, also a Heating and Redness, and is mostly caused by the Abundance of Blood drawn or flowing to the Breast, and sometimes, but rarely, it is occasioned by the suppression of the <hi>Menses,</hi> the Hemorrhoids, or some Bruise received by a Blow, or the like, and is known by a certain Redness, and burning Heat, causing the whole to be Feverish and out of Order. To cure it then, first let the Diet
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0541900200:177"/>
be comforting, moistening, and of good Nourishment, as the Broth of Pullets, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, Cocks, Chickens, Veal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Endive, Borage, Purslain or Letuce has been boiled; and if she can get it, let the Woman drink Juice of Pomegranats; but for want of that, Barly-water wherein An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niseeds have been boiled; but let her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain drinking of Wine and strong Liquors, as likewise hot Spices; and if she find any Obstruction in her excremental Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let her take a softning or mollifying Clyster, and sleep at seasonable times as much as she can.

               <p>OF Tumours there are several sorts, but first of the Flagitious Tumour, the Cause of which proceeds from a thick and unnatural Vapour, arising from the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strual Blood, which is retained corrupted in the Matrix, and that again occasioned by the suppression of the Courses, or when Nature is defective in discharging them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their proper Place in due time; as also from Corruption of Humours, whereby are ingendred evil Vapours, and their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by several Ways, causes the Breast to swell or distend as if it were a true swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and is known by a shooting pain, and disorder of Heart, by Reason of the Wind that oppresseth it, the left Breast being for the most part more swelled than the right, communicating Pains to the Arms and Shoulders, as likewise the Ribs on the same side, the Breast being white and shining, sounding like a Drum if touched gently, and swelled in all Parts alike: to cure this, as also the windy Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, you must order to observe a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in Diet, and thereby Crudities may be avoided, and all such things as contract windy Humours in the Veins, suffering her
<pb facs="tcp:0541900200:179"/>
to drink Water wherein Cinnamon and Anniseeds have been boiled, as also the Rind of Citron, and then let her observe to take such things as are proper to provoke the Courses, in doing which she will find the Humours abate, then let her take Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lundine, Camomile, Groundsil, and Ground-Juice, stamp them and boil them in White wine, and in so doing, you will ease the Pain and restore the Breast. As for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases and Accidents incident to young Children, there are few Women of any Experience, but are skilful in curing and ordering them, wherefore for brevities sake I shall pass them over and proceed to Anatommize the Genital Parts of a Man, that one thing remaining necessary in this Trreatise; as also to instance what Men and Women ought to marry, that their Issue may be fair, healthful, and prosperous.</p>

               <p>It is convenient on this Occasion to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the Body with generous Restoratives, to charm the Imagination with Musick, to drown all Cares in good Wine; that so the Mind being elevated to a Pitch of Joy and Rapture, the sensual Appetite may be more freely encouraged to gratifie it self in the Delights of Nature: For Melancholy and Grief and whatsoever is troublesome to the Senses and Fancy, are Enemies to the Pastime of the Nuptial-Bed.

Also when the Husband and Wife meet with an equal Ardour in their conjugal Embraces, it is very rare if it be not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Conception. But when that Act is over, all is not done; for, that it may have the better Suceess, the Husband must not presently seperate himself from his Wife's Embraces, lest the Air should suddenly strike in, and so prevent the Issue of their Labours. And when the Man departs the Woman ought to compose her self to all the Rest and Quietness imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to avoid heavy Thoughts of what may cause any Disturbance; and especially she ought to avoid Coughing and Snee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, both which are great hinderances to Conception, after the Act of Copulation.</p>
