            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the inſtructions which are included in the following ſheets, promiſe to be of moſt utility to the unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced collector in the form of pocket aſſiſtant, to which he may occaſionally reſort for information, we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to diveſt them of whatever appeared in the ſmalleſt degree ſuperfluous to that deſign; at the ſame time that we were careful to avoid unneceſſary brevity, or paſſing ſilently over thoſe particulars which required to be placed in a perſpicuous point of view.</p>
            <p>We have to obſerve as an apology for its publication, that the treatiſe on the management of inſects, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for the preſervation of birds, appear at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs requeſt of many ſubſcribers to our Natural Hiſtories, and that we have only exceeded their ſolicitations by add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what relates to the preſervation of animals, ſhells, corals, and other natural productions; ſuch addition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to us likely to render the volume more acceptable to the early naturaliſt, whoſe enquiries are not confined to the ſtudy of birds, or the ſcience of entomology.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the practical part of thoſe inſtructions, it will not be expected that the natural attitude of an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, a bird, or an inſect, can be given ſo well by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful operator as by a profeſſional man, who is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice, it muſt rather be inferred that by due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the information we have given, he may enſure their preſervation from the ravages of thoſe deſtructive mites, and the larvae of minute beetles or moths which breed among the feathers of birds, the hair of animals, or down of inſects, and would deſtroy them in the courſe of a few ſummer months, unleſs prevented by timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1109500100:3"/>Although we have found it neceſſary to treat of inſects in a more extenſive manner than of any other ſubject in the work, we have principally confined our attention to the practical part, without entering into any particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to their ſcientific arrangement in the cabinet; for however ſuch a digreſſion might aſſiſt the ſtudent, it would not only be foreign to our deſign, but render the whole too voluminous and expenſive for general accomodation.</p>
            <p>A practical and ſcientific knowledge of inſects, are ſo intimately connected with each other, that a competent knowledge of the former muſt be combined with the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before any conſiderable proficiency can be acquired; the inexperienced entomologiſt muſt not reſt ſatisfied with the preſerved ſpecimens in his cabinet, he muſt attend carefully to their manners, peculiar poſitions, and many other circumſtances in a living ſtate, before he can attempt to aſcertain the ſpecies, or even genus of many kinds.</p>
            <p>Many other advantages will reſult to perſons of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, from a minute obſervance of inſects in a living ſtate, but as we care not to expatiate on what may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known to them, we ſhall conclude with obſerving, that as every perſon, who may feel an inclination to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate a few of his leiſure hours to the ſtudy of entomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, cannot have an opportunity to procure the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inſtructions, and thoſe eſpecially whoſe buſineſs, or concerns, require their reſidence in a diſtant part of the country, we conceive that the preſent treatiſe will not be unacceptable; we ſubmit it to the candid peruſal of thoſe, whoſe exertions in practical entomology it is moſt likely to aſſiſt, but truſt that among the variety of other inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are concentrated from the beſt authorities, at leaſt ſome will be found uſeful to every claſs of natural hiſtory collectors.</p>

               <head>THE PRESERVATION OF ANIMALS AND BIRDS.</head>
               <p>ALTHOUGH Quadrupedes conſtitute one of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant diviſions of Natural Hiſtory, we have ſcarcely any col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in this country that includes more than a very partial ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſmalleſt kinds; indeed the many unſurmountable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which would offer to a collector in this department, independent of an immenſe expence, will ever deter the moſt affluent, from an attempt that muſt be ultimately unſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>Collections of Birds are more frequent both in the living and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſtate; they are more engaging in appearance, and require leſs expence and trouble.</p>
               <p>The following rules may be uſeful to the curious traveller, if he has any deſire to preſerve ſome of the rare ſpecimens either of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1109500100:5"/>Animals or Birds that he may meet with in foreign countries; and ſhould he even want experience enough to give them their proper attitudes, he may preſerve them free from injury, and tranſmit them from one part of the world to another without any apprehenſion of depredation by Inſects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precautions to be obſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Provide a quantity of allum, arſenic, camphire, ſulphur, and warm ſpices; tobacco, tanners bark, bitter aloes, and ſpirit of wine; ſome cotton, wool, fine tow, and oakum.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>ANIMALS</head>
                  <p>MUST be entirely diveſted of the fleſh; firſt open the ſkin with a pair of ſharp-pointed ſciſſars, in a ſtrait direction from the vent to the throat, and take away all the inſide, ſcoop out the brains, take away the eyes, and with the ſciſſars cut off whatever fleſh you can from within the head, as the tongue, &amp;c., but leave the ſkull; during this operation be careful to preſerve the mouth, ſnout, feet, and claws perfect, and if any blood, or ſlimy matter adheres to the hair, waſh it off with a ſponge and warm water: the ſkin muſt then be laid on a flat board, or table, and rubbed on the inſide with ſome compoſition liquor, or powder, until it feels perfectly dry under the hand. The liquor is thus prepared:</p>
                  <p>Diſſolve ſome camphire in a quantity of ſpirit of wine, and thereto add a proportion of burnt-allum and ſulphur; to one ounce of the camphire that is diſſolved in the ſpirit of wine, put</p>
                  <p>Half a pound of burnt-allum, and</p>
                  <p>One ounce of ſulphur.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1109500100:6"/>Or of Tanners bark well dried and powdered two parts,</p>
                  <p>Tobacco highly dried one part, and</p>
                  <p>Burnt-allum one part; firſt bake the allum to a cake on a ſhovel, and reduce it to a fine powder.</p>
                  <p>Add to every pound of thoſe ingredients,
<list>
                        <item>One ounce of arſenic,</item>
                        <item>Ditto camphire,</item>
                        <item>Half an ounce of ſulphur.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Either of thoſe compoſitions may be prepared at leiſure, and kept always fit for uſe, if the bottles in which they are preſerved are well corked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Colonel Davies</hi> adviſes, to prepare the mixture with a double pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of burnt-allum, and to add one ounce of bitter aloes.</p>
                  <p>Introduce a ſtrong wire frame to aſſiſt in giving the attitude, or to ſupport the animal in a ſtanding poſition; then ſtuff the ſkin either with tow, wool, or cotton, according to the ſize of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, but be very cautious not to diſtend the ſkin in any part ſo as to give it an unnatural appearance: it will be better to meaſure the exact proportion of every part before you take off the ſkin.</p>
                  <p>The eyes are made of glaſs, and may be purchaſed at the glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bead manufactories, of any ſize or colour; black are thoſe which ſuit moſt ſubjects, but if it ſhould be neceſſary to have only a black, or dark ſpeek in the centre of a white bead, it can be blown with a pipe to a proper ſize on the bead, or painted with oil colour; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to prevent obſtacles, it will be moſt adviſable for travellers to purchaſe a complete aſſortment.—<hi>Note.</hi> Open the eye-lids very wide, and introduce the bead into the ſocket, the bead muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1109500100:7"/>larger than the true eye, that it may fill up the ſpace; then draw together the eye-lids and adjuſt them ſo as to leave a proper opening.</p>
                  <p>For convenience, the Animal may be tranſported from the <hi>Indies,</hi> or any diſtant part of the world, and the intended attitude may be given after it has arrived, only be careful to pack it up in a cloſe box with a quantity of tobacco and camphire.</p>
                  <p>But the beſt and moſt expeditious method, if the ſize of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal will permit, is to plunge it into a bottle or barrel of ſpirits; in this manner it will retain the ſize and proportions infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than what the utmoſt ſkill of man can imitate, by any attempt to ſtuff the ſkins only. <hi>Obſerve</hi> to cover the mouths of the bottles with tin foil, or with a compoſition of melted reſin and borax.</p>
                  <p>Experiments have been made to preſerve the ſkins of Animals, with part of their fleſh and bones within, ſo as to give the exact di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the living creature; for this purpoſe they are opened as before deſcribed, the entrails taken out, with all the fleſh that can conveniently be cut away; the brains, eyes, tongue, &amp;c.; alſo cut off the fleſh on the ſides of the ribs as low as poſſible and ſcrape the bones, then rub the ſkin well with the preparing powder, and fill up every vacant part with the ſame compoſition, of burnt-allum, tanners bark, &amp;c. as before deſcribed; but add ſome wool and cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or tow, which has been ſteeped in ſpirit of wine and camphire; then ſew up the opening. It muſt after this preparation be baked in a ſlack oven, but the heat muſt be ſo exactly tempered as not to ſcorch the hair.</p>

                  <head>BIRDS.</head>
                  <p>THE different methods of preſerving Birds perfectly agree in moſt reſpects with thoſe for the preſervation of Animals; only as they are generally ſmaller, they are more difficult to prepare, and a greater number of inſtruments will be required.</p>
                  <p>Provide a quantity of different ſized wires, if nealed it will be beſt; a variety of coloured glaſs beads, thoſe which are black may have artificial irides painted on them, and will ſuit many ſubjects; a blunt pen will do very well to take away the brains with, if the Bird is ſmall; but large ſpecimens will require a ſmall ſcoop; a pair of nippers, to aſſiſt in taking out the entrails; wire clippers, ſmall awls, ſmall files, knives, ſciſſars, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Open the Bird along the breaſt, (if neceſſary from the vent to the throat) and ſeparate the ſkin on each ſide from the fleſh, take out the entrails, &amp;c.; then proceed to cut out the fleſh, and ſo much of the bones as you can conveniently; or it will be better to take off the ſkin, and only leave the bones of the head and thighs; ſcoop out the brains, eyes, tongue, roof of the mouth, &amp;c. and ſtrew the ſkin with preſerving powder; introduce two ſtout wires (according to the ſize of the Bird), which have been ſharpened at their points, through the ſoles of the feet, up the legs, and cloſe to the breaſt; leave an inch or more without the feet, when you cut off the wires: at the ends which reach the breaſt the wires are interwoven with three others, one whereof paſſes up the neck, and through the head and noſtril, where it muſt be cut off, or filed ſmooth; the others paſs one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1109500100:9"/>into each wing: two more are united to thoſe in their deſcent, and are paſſed into the tail. Thus prepared the inſide muſt be ſtrewed with the preſerving powder, and filled with fine dry tow, or cotton, (and ſome moſs if convenient.) <hi>Obſerve,</hi> that if the ſtuffing has been before ſteeped in ſpirit of wine, it will be better; and you may put a quantity of muſk, or camphire, into the body with the tow.</p>
                  <p>Begin at the vent with your needle and ſilk, and as you ſew up the ſkin add as much ſtuffing as the ſkin will bear without tearing; paſs your needle from the inſide outwards, which will prevent the feathers being in the way. When you have entirely cloſed the opening lay the feathers ſmooth on the breaſt, ſo as to conceal the ſewing; then introduce the eyes into the ſockets. The two pieces of wire which are left through the ſoles of the feet are intended to fix it in the caſe; if you mean to have it perched on a ſtump, or branch, you are to make a hole through the wood, and paſs thoſe wires through. The Birds muſt be baked in a ſlack oven until all the moiſture is exhaled; the proper degree of heat may be known by putting a feather into the oven; if it is ſcorched, or curled up, the heat is too great.</p>

                     <p>Obſerve, that the crevices in the caſes which are to receive the Birds, are to be ſtopped up with <hi>plaiſter of Paris,</hi> ſo as to entirely exclude all external air; and when the fronts are glazed, do not omit to put a quantity of camphire into each caſe, as that alone will greatly

If at any time you diſcover fragments of feathers at the bottom of the caſe, it is a ſign of the depredations of inſects, and do not delay to open the caſe, and burn a quantity of ſulphur in it for an hour or more; this will in moſt circumſtances deſtroy the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects until the following ſeaſon, and no way injure the Bird; but ſhould it prove inſufficient, bake-them as before, and the larvae of the inſects will be inevitably deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Birds are ſometimes preſerved in ſpirits, during a voyage; in this caſe, it is proper to wrap each ſubject up in a piece of fine linen, to prevent their receiving any injury, either by rubbing againſt one another, or the ſides of the veſſels which contain them.</p>
                     <p>The legs of many Birds fade immediately after death, the beak is liable to the ſame change; and ſome have caruncles, or fleſhy protuberances, which alſo loſe colour, as the neck of the Caſſowary, wattles of the Cock, neck of the Golden Vulture, &amp;c. all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects muſt be remedied by painting the parts, as near as poſſible to the natural hue, with oil colours.</p>
                     <p>The natives of the <hi>Papau Iſlands,</hi> it is reported, have a peculiar method of preſerving the ſkins of the leſſer Birds of Paradiſe; they take out the entrails, ſear their inſides with a red-hot iron, and put them into hollow pieces of <hi>bamboo.</hi> Similar practices on Birds of this, or other countries, will perhaps render it very neceſſary, when ſtuffed ſpecimens are received, to examine whether a quantity of the fleſh is contained within the ſkin, and if ſuch fleſh has not been properly prepared, it ſhould be immediately cleared away; for this purpoſe wrap the Bird in a wet cloth, and let it remain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1109500100:12"/>therein for two or three hours; it will be ſo much relaxed by this treatment that it may be opened and the fleſh taken away.</p>
                     <p>It may be alſo relaxed by holding it a few minutes over the ſteam of boiling water, or by being put into the earth and covered over for a few hours. It is a practice with ſeamen to ſtuff the ſkins of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals and Birds with ſaw-duſt, which anſwers very well for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation during a voyage, but if permitted to remain within the ſkin for any conſiderable time after, it may ſerve as a <hi>nidus</hi> for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which, being hatched, will entirely devour the ſkin and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or hair.</p>
                     <p>If you wiſh to preſerve the neſt and eggs, it will only be neceſſary to blow out the contents of the eggs, and faſten them into the neſt with gum or glue.</p>

               <p>Some ſpecies of Reptiles, and a few of Fiſhes, may be preſerved by opening them, and taking out all the inſide, then being ſtrewed with the preſerving powder, and filled with tow; after which they ſhould be covered with two or three coats of copal varniſh.</p>

               <head>THE EGG.</head>
               <p>THE eggs of an Inſect are always ſmall, compared with the ſize of the Inſect itſelf; they vary in number and figure in different ſpecies; ſome are round, others oval; ſome are cylindrical, and others nearly ſquare; the ſhells of ſome are hard and ſmooth, while others are ſoft and flexible. It is a rule, but is not invariable, that the eggs never encreaſe in ſize after they are laid.</p>
               <p>They are found of almoſt every ſhade of colour, and are always diſpoſed in thoſe ſituations where the young brood may find a convenient ſupply of proper food; ſome Inſects depoſit their eggs in the oak-leaf, producing there the red gall; others cauſe a ſimilar appearance on the poplar-leaf, and the red protuberances on the willow-leaf, and the termination of the juniper branches are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by like means: the leaves of ſome plants are drawn into a globular head by the eggs of an Inſect lodged therein; and many curious circumſtances relative to this oeconomy might be noticed if the nature of our plan would permit.</p>
               <p>The Phryganea, Libellula, Gnat, Ephemera, &amp;c. hover all day over the water to depoſit their eggs, which are hatched in the water, and remain there all the time they are in the larva form. Many Moths cover their eggs with a thick bed of hair which they gather from their bodies, and others cover them with a glutinous compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, when dry, protects them from moiſture, rain, and cold; and the Wolf-Spider carefully preſerves its eggs in a ſilk bag, which it carries on its back: by ſome Moths they are glued with great ſymmetry round the ſmaller branches of trees, or are ſecreted beneath the bark, and frequently in the crevices of walls, in hollow ſtalks, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>THE CATERPILLAR.</head>
               <p>ALL Caterpillars are hatched from the egg, and when they firſt proceed from it are ſmall and feeble, but their ſtrength increaſes in proportion with their ſize; a diſtinguiſhing character of the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar of a Lepidopterous Inſect is not having leſs than eight, or more than ſixteen feet.</p>
               <p>The Caterpillar, whoſe life is one continued ſucceſſion of changes, moults its ſkin ſeveral times before it attains its full growth; thoſe changes are the more ſingular as it is not ſimply the ſkin which is caſt off; but with the exuviae we find the ſkull, the jaws, and all the exterior parts, both ſcaly and membranaceous, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the lips, antennae, palpi, and even thoſe cruſtaceous pieces within the head, which ſerve as a fixed baſis to a number of muſcles, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The new organs are under the old ones, as in a ſheath, ſo that the Caterpillar effects its change by withdrawing from the old ſkin when it finds it inadequate to its bulk.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Caterpillars who live in ſociety, and have a neſt, retire there to caſt their exuviae; fixing the hooks of their feet firmly in the web during the operation. Some of the ſolitary ſpecies ſpin at this time a ſlender web, to which they affix themſelves. A day or two before the critical moment for its moulting, the Inſect ceaſes to eat, and loſes its uſual activity, the colours gradually become weaker and the Caterpillar more feeble, the ſkin hardens and withers, the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1109500100:20"/>creature lifts up its back, ſtretches itſelf to the utmoſt extent, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times elevates its head, moving it a little from one ſide to another, and ſuddenly letting it fall again; near the change, the ſecond and third rings are ſeen to ſwell conſiderably; and by repeated exertions a ſlit is made on the back, generally beginning on the ſecond or third ring: through this diviſion the new ſkin may be juſt perceived by the brightneſs of its colours; the creature preſſes through like a wedge, and thereby ſeparates the ſkin from the firſt to the fourth ring, which ſufficiently enlarges the aperture to admit the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar through.</p>
               <p>The Caterpillar commonly faſts a whole day each time after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating this operation: ſome Caterpillars in changing their ſkins, from ſmooth, become covered with hair; while others, that were covered with hair, have their laſt ſkins ſmooth.</p>
               <p>The food of Caterpillars is chiefly or entirely of the vegetable kind. The larvae<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Larva</hi> is a term uſually applied to the ſecond ſtate of all Inſects, except thoſe of Moths and Butterflies, which are called Caterpillars.</note> of Beetles live under the ſurface of the earth, and prey upon ſmaller Inſects, on the roots and tender fibrils of plants, or on filthy matter in general; indeed in the laſt ſtate beetles are moſt commonly found in putrid fleſh, or in the excrements of animals.</p>
               <p>When the Caterpillar has attained its full ſize, and all the parts of the future Moth, or Butterfly, are ſufficiently formed beneath the ſkin, it prepares to change into the chryſalis or pupa ſtate; ſome ſpin webs, or cones, in which they encloſe themſelves; others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the earth and conceal themſelves in little cells which they form in the light looſe mould; ſome are ſuſpended by a girdle which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1109500100:21"/>paſſes round the body, and is faſtened to the ſmall twigs of trees; and Caterpillars of Butterflies connect themſelves by their poſterior extremity to the ſtalks or leaves of plants with their head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The length of time Inſects live in the ſtate of Caterpillars is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame in each individual ſpecies, yet very few ſpecies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely agree to the ſame period for their changes; ſome live two or three years, others only a few months, or even weeks, before they paſs to the pupa or chryſalis ſtate.</p>
               <p>Preparatory to the change, the Caterpillar ceaſes to take any of its food, empties itſelf of all the excrementitious matter that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the inteſtines, voiding at the ſame time the membrane which ſerved as a lining to theſe, and the ſtomach; and perſeveres in a ſtate of inactivity for ſeveral days. At length, by a proceſs ſimilar to its former moulting, the outer ſkin, or ſlough, is caſt off, and the creature thus diveſted of its laſt ſkin is what we call the Chryſalis.</p>

               <head>PUPA, CHRYSALIS, OR AURELIA.</head>
               <p>THE words Aurelia or Chryſalis are equally uſed to expreſs that inactive ſtate which enſues after the Caterpillar has changed, for the great purpoſe of preparing for the <hi>Imago,</hi> or transformation to the Fly. Aurelia, is derived from the Latin <hi>aurum,</hi> and Chryſalis from the Greek, and are both intended to ſignify a creature formed of gold; this however is giving a general title, from a very partial circumſtance, as the colour of a conſiderable number are black, or dark brown, while the reſplendence of gold is only ſeen on the Chryſalides of a few ſpecies of the Papilio, or Butterfly. The term Chryſalis ſhould therefore be uſed to ſignify only thoſe of the Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly kind, and Pupa for the Phalaenae, or Moths, as well as thoſe of Sphinxes, or Hawk Moths.</p>
               <p>That very intelligent naturaliſt M. de <hi>Reaumur</hi> explains the cauſe of this brilliant appearance; it proceeds from two ſkins, the upper one a beautiful brown, which covers a highly-poliſhed ſmooth white ſkin: the light reflected from the laſt, in paſſing through the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, communicates this bright golden yellow, in the ſame manner as this colour is often given to leather, ſo that the whole appears gilded, although no gold enters into that tincture.</p>
               <p>The exterior part of the Pupa is at firſt exceedingly tender, ſoft, and partly tranſparent, being covered with a thick viſcous ſluid, but which drying forms a new covering for the animal.</p>
               <p>The time each Inſect remains in this ſtate is very eaſily aſcertained by thoſe who once breed them, as they always remain the ſame ſpace

(Heart Moth)</hi> remained from the beginning of October till May following; and many ſpecies remain a very conſiderable time longer than this.</p>
               <p>When the Inſect has acquired a ſuitable degree of ſolidity and ſtrength, it endeavours to free itſelf from the caſe in which it is confined; and as it adheres to a very few parts of the body it does not require any great exertion to ſplit the membrane which covers it; a ſmall degree of motion, or a little inflation of the body is ſufficient for the purpoſe; theſe motions reiterated a few times, enlarge the opening and afford more convenience for the Inſect's eſcape; this opening is always formed a little above the trunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the wings, and a ſmall piece which covers the head. Thoſe ſpecies which ſpin a cone, gnaw or pierce an aperture large enough for their emancipation.</p>
               <p>The Moth immediately after emerging from its caſe is moiſt, with the wings very ſmall, thick, and crumpled; but they rapidly expand under the eye of the obſerver, and in a few minutes have attained their full ſize; the moiſture evaporates, the ſpots on the wings, which at firſt appeared confuſed, become diſtinct, and the fibres, which were before flexible, become ſtiff and hard as bones.</p>
               <p>When the wings are unfolded, the antennae in motion, the tongue coiled up, the Moth fuſſiciently dried, and its different members ſtrengthened, it is prepared for flight. The excrementitious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge which is voided by moſt Inſects at this time M. de Reaumur thinks is the laſt they eject during their lives.</p>

               <head>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.</head>
               <p>INSECTS are collected in every ſtate, though in the Caterpillar, or Chryſalis, they are preferred, not only as the time of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the winged ſtate may be then carefully attended to, but they will not be ſo liable to disfigure and damage their tender mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as thoſe which have been in the wind or rain; and if they are taken with care from the breeding-cage immediately after their wings have attained a proper ſize, they may be preſerved free from any injury to thoſe beautiful feathers, which are generally much diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in ſuch Inſects as are taken in flight.</p>
               <p>There are ſome which cannot be found in the Caterpillar ſtate; or if found, cannot be provided with food; thoſe are generally of that kind which collectors term internal, or underground feeders, and either ſubſiſt on ſome ſubſtance unknown to us, or which we cannot raadily ſupply. The larvae of Beetles and many other kinds of Inſects, are of this deſcription: numbers of the Moth tribe have hitherto only been taken in the Fly ſtate, and are ſuppoſed to feed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1109500100:27"/>in the night; they live in cells which they form in the earth, and come up in the evening to feed, but deſcend again into their cells before day-break; it is therefore that ſome Aurelians have ſought for Caterpillars by the light of a candle or lanthorn, and have been very ſucceſsful: the moſt valuable inſects have been diſcovered by this means.</p>
               <p>Inſects are found in almoſt every ſituation, the ſummits of the loftieſt trees, and the loweſt herbage equally abound, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations between ſwarm with an infinity of ſpecies: the collector muſt be therefore ſupplied with a different apparatus, according to the ſtate in which the Inſects may be found; thoſe in preſent uſe, though few and ſimple, require very little improvement, as they anſwer every neceſſary purpoſe.

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1109500100:28"/>The net is to be made of Scotch gauſe, not very fine, and bound entirely round with a broad welt, doubled to form a groove into which the ſticks are to ſlip:—this bordering may be excepted at d d, but the gauſe at bottom muſt be turned up about ſix inches and form a bag; each ſtick or frame when the pieces are fitted together, is to paſs into the groove at b b, ſlip up to c, and be there faſtened by a piece of tape through a loop or hole; let the whole be drawn tight and each ſide at b b be tied to the nails; the handles are to be held one in each hand, when the net is uſed.</p>
               <p>With this net it is intended to catch Moths on the wing, and that purpoſe it anſwers very effectually, as it may be inſtantly opened or folded together, and ſecure the Inſect between; even Inſects of the ſmalleſt kinds cannot eſcape, if the net is not damaged and the gauſe fine.</p>
               <p>It alſo anſwers well for collecting Caterpillars.—Expand the net immediately under the buſh, or branch you mean to examine, another perſon may beat or ſhake the buſh with a ſtout ſtick, and not only a number of Caterpillars will fall down, but many of the minuter kinds of coleopterous, and other Inſects alſo; Moths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main torpid and ſhelter in the buſhes in the day time, and by beating are ery often taken, as they cannot readily fly away when they fall into the net.</p>

               <p>The forceps are about ten or twelve inches in length, are made of ſteel, and may be purchaſed at the hardware ſhops; their fans are made either of a triangular or hexangular form, and are covered with fine gauſe; they are held and moved as a pair of ſciſſars, and where they can be conveniently uſed are to be preſerred, as the

If an Inſect is on a leaf, both leaf and Inſect may be encloſed in the forceps; or if it be lodged againſt the trunk of a tree, paling, or any flat ſurface, you may very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently entrap it; when you have it between the gauſe, preſs with your thumb, (or thumb nail if the creature be ſmall) on the thorax, rather ſmartly, but not ſo as to cruſh it; you may then ſhake it into your hand to ſet it, without any apprehenſion of its flying away: or you may put the pin through the thorax while the Inſect is confined between the gauſe, open the forceps and take it carefully out by the pin.</p>

                  <p>MOST Caterpillars lurk among the loweſt herbage in the night time, begin to aſcend early in the morning, and about noon are found feeding on the tops of their reſpective plants; they deſcend gradually as the ſun declines, and at the cloſe of the evening are again concealed in the low herbage: night feeders aſcend in the evening, and deſcend as morning approaches.</p>

                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1109500100:32"/>Doctor Lodovico Bellardi, a learned and ingenious Botaniſt of Turin, diſcovered, about ſix years ago, after a number of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a new method of feeding Silk-worms, when they are hatched before the mulberry-trees have produced leaves, or when it happens that the froſt deſtroys the tender branches. Whether this diſcovery may be applied with equal propriety in other inſtances ſeems at preſent undertermined, though from ſome recent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we are inclined to believe the poſſibility of feeding Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in backward ſeaſons in this manner; we have tried ſeveral Caterpillars which were nearly full fed on the leaves of thorns and oak ſo prepared, and have obſerved them to eat it when no other food was given, but cannot ſay how they may thrive if fed on that aliment alone. This new method conſiſts in giving the Caterpillars the dried leaves of their uſual food, powdered and moiſtened; and repeated experiments, ſays our author, prove that they (the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars of Silk-worms) prefer it to any other, and eat it with the greateſt avidity. The leaves muſt be gathered about the end of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, before the froſt commences, in dry weather, and at times when the heat is greateſt. They muſt be dried afterwards in the ſun, by ſpreading them upon large cloths, and laid up in a dry place after they have been reduced to powder. When it is neceſſary to give this powder to the Caterpillars it ſhould be gently moiſtened with a little water, and a thin coat muſt be placed round the young worms, which will immediately begin too feed upon it.</p>

                  <p>Such as wiſh to collect, ſhould pay a proper attention to the ſtate of the weather; if it proves fine, and the ſun emits much warmth, Inſects are very briſk; but if a cold or windy day it will be only a fruitleſs toil to attempt collecting, as all Inſects at ſuch times ſhelter within the herbage, and inſtead of flying upward, as uſual when diſturbed, they dart into the thickeſt of the underwood; or if once they riſe above the buſhes, they are impetuouſly hurled by the current of the wind, far beyond the reach of the fowling-net.</p>

                  <p>Butterflies are abroad in the day time only; and the beſt time to collect Moths on the wing, is during the night, eſpecially an hour or two after ſun-ſet.</p>
                  <p>At day-break many Inſects are on the wing; and moſt kinds are obſerved in hot weather to come forth after rain, to enjoy the humidity of the air, which is then damp but warm.

                  <p>The males of ſome, if not of every ſpecies of the Moth tribe, and perhaps of other Inſects alſo, by a very aſtoniſhing faculty, are able to diſcover the females at a great diſtance, and in the moſt ſecret ſituations; this has been before noticed by <hi>Barbut, Harris,</hi> and others; and ſome collectors have endeavoured to find the male In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects by this means; they encloſe the living female in a breeding-box, and place it as near the uſual haunts of the ſpecies as convenient, the males will generally be obſerved ſoon after, fluttering on the box, and endeavouring to gain admiſſion to the female. This experiment is generally practiſed with ſucceſs on the Fox, and Egger, Moths.</p>
                  <p>Every ſpecies has a diſtinct time for its appearance, and this punctuality is ſcarcely forwarded or retarded a few days, except by the unuſual mildneſs or inclemency of the ſeaſon: if you diſcover a brood of Inſects at a certain time of the year, preciſely or nearly at the ſame period of the year following, you will find a brood of the ſame ſpecies; unleſs by accident they have been deſtroyed.

                  <head>THE CATERPILLAR.</head>
                  <p>The preſervation of Inſects in this ſtate, is not only one of the moſt curious, but uſeful diſcoveries that have been made in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of ſcience. They may be preſerved by being plunged into phials filled with well rectified ſpirits of wine: this method ſhould ever be preferred by thoſe who collect in a diſtant country, if their ſubjects are not likely to be injured by ſuch a proceſs, the moſt delicate Caterpillars will retain their exact ſize, but the ſpirits will generally extract the colour, and from thoſe eſpecially which have very tender ſkins.</p>
                  <p>But the manner in which <hi>Swammerdam</hi> preſerved his Caterpillars, completely obviates this defect, and if carefully managed, it not only preſerves the exact ſize, but generally retains the colours as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as in the living creature.</p>
                  <p>He uſed to make a ſmall inciſion or puncture in the tail, and having very gently and with much patience preſſed out all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained humours, injected wax into them, ſo as to give them all the appearance of healthy living Inſects. In this manner he has preſerved many very ſmall ſpecimens.</p>
                  <p>There is another method which is more generally known to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors; it conſiſts in taking out all the inſide of the Caterpillar, and inflating the ſkin by means of a glaſs tube.</p>
                  <p>The entrails, with whatever of the ſleſhy ſubſtance can conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, is drawn through the anus by means of ſine wire curved at the end; when the inſide is emptied, the glaſs tube is inſerted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1109500100:43"/>into the opening, through which the operator continues to blow while he turns the ſkin at the end ſlowly round over a charcoal fire; this hardens the ſkin equally, and dries up all the moiſture within; a pin is then put through it to fix it in a ſtanding poſition: if the ſkin is tender it may be filled with white paper or cotton.</p>
                  <p>But this is a moſt cruel operation on the little victim, and ſuch as muſt ſhock the feelings of the human ſoul; if therefore any other method can be introduced which will effect the purpoſe in a ſhort time, the practice ſhould be exploded as wanton barbarity.</p>
                  <p>Various attempts have been made, and among theſe ſome have tried to drown the Caterpillar, but you will never be able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh its death in this manner, unleſs it remains for a conſiderable time under water, and though it may appear dead, the principle of life will not be deſtroyed. Mr. <hi>Bonnet,</hi> making experiments on the reſpiration of Inſects, had one Caterpillar which lived eight days with only two of its anterior ſpiracula in the air.</p>
                  <p>The method we wiſh to recommend is to obſerve when the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar is on the point of caſting its laſt ſkin; drop it by the threads into ſcalding water, and quickly withdraw it; the creature will be killed inſtantly; then put it into ſome diſtilled vinegar mixed with ſpirit of wine, which will give a proper firmneſs to all the parts and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate the ſeparation of the ſkin from the body; the fleſh may be carefully extracted, and the exuvia or ſkin be blown up by means of a glaſs tube while ſuſpended over a charcoal fire, as before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Anoint it with oil of ſpike in which ſome reſin has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, unleſs it is a hairy Caterpillar.</p>

                  <p>The Chineſe ſeldom take care to diſplay the parts of their Inſects after the European manner; thoſe we receive from China are ſtuck on long needles; if Beetles often through one elytra, ſo that the membranaceous wings are entirely concealed.</p>
                  <p>If the Inſects require only a little relaxation to extend the parts, uſe a camel's hair pencil moiſtened with ſpirit of wine; but if this ſhould prove inſufficient, fix them on a piece of cork and float them in an earthen pan half filled with water; it is better to cover the pan with a damp cloth, and the Inſects will be ſo limber, after a ſew hours, that they may be reſet in any poſition.</p>

                  <head>LEPIDOPTEROUS INSECTS, AS BUTTERFLIES, HAWK-MOTHS, AND MOTHS.</head>
                  <p>IT is uſual to put two ſpecimens of each ſpecies of the Butterfly kind into the cabinet, one to diſplay the upper, and the other the under ſide; for the under ſide is much more beautiful in moſt ſpecies, and differs entirely in appearance from the upper ſide.</p>
                  <p>Sphinxes and Moths are generally diſpoſed in pairs to ſhew the male and female, and as their under ſides are ſeldom very beautiful, only their upper ſides are ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>Except a few ſpecies, Moths conſtantly conceal their under wings when at reſt; but collectors ſacrifice the propriety of their remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a natural poſition, in order to diſplay the under wings.—It is adviſable to have one of every kind in a natural poſture, as that will often eſſentially aſſiſt to determine the family of the Inſect.</p>
                  <p>Provide a quantity of card braces, made in the ſame form as that repreſented at FIG. 8, PLATE II; and a board of a convenient
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1109500100:48"/>ſize, covered with ſoft cork; it muſt be perfectly even on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and papered; this is termed the ſetting board.</p>
                  <p>For ſmall Moths it is only neceſſary to put the pin through the thorax and they die in a very ſhort time; but for larger kinds, the pin ſhould be dipped in ſtrong aqua fortis before it is put through the Inſect.</p>
                  <p>It is very difficult to kill the largeſt kinds of Moths and Sphinxes:—ſelect a large pin (comparatively for the ſize of the Inſect) and dip it into aqua-fortis as before, but immediately that the pin is forced through the thorax withdraw it, and put a drop of aqua fortis into the wound; ſhould this prove inſufficient to kill it, put the point of the pin through a card, and hold it in the flame of a candle until it becomes red hot; this will kill the Inſect immediately, and the card will protect it from being injured by the flame.</p>
                  <p>The Moth is then to be fixed on the ſetting board, and the braces are to be applied in the manner ſhewn at FIG. 9, PLATE II. The wings are to be carefully diſplayed by means of a large pin, and the braces put cloſe down to prevent their return to the natural poſition.—<hi>Note,</hi> All Inſects muſt be ſet while they remain limber, for if the parts ſtiffen they are apt to ſnap; they may be relaxed by floating them in a pan of water.</p>
                  <p>Inſects ſhould remain beneath the braces on the ſetting board until all the aqueous moiſture be evaporated, or the wings will ſtart from their poſition, and the bodies turn black, or mouldy; they ſhould be placed in a dry ſituation, and be covered with gauſe for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1109500100:49"/>the admiſſion of air for the ſpace of a month at leaſt, before they are put into the cabinet.</p>
                  <p>It is proper in this place to caution the young beginner not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to kill the Inſects by fumigations of ſulphur, &amp;c. a practice too frequent with perſons of this deſcription, for ſhould be by this means deprive the creature of its life, he will alſo deprive it of its beauty: It is even doubtful whether many may not ſurvive the operation.</p>
                  <p>M. Lyonet placed ſeveral of the large Muſk Beetles, probably the Cerambyx Moſchatus, under a glaſs where he had been burning ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and which he kept burning while they were there; and though the vapour was ſo thick that he could not diſcern them, and that he kept them therein more than half an hour, they did not ſeem in the leaſt incommoded<note n="*" place="bottom">Leſſer Theologie Des Inſectes. Tom. I. p. 124. Ibid p. 126.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Some Moths are very liable to change colour when placed in the cabinet, and particularly thoſe which collectors term <hi>full-bodied;</hi> an oily matter is common to all Inſects, but thoſe are charged with a ſuperabundance. It appears at firſt in ſpots on the body, but gradually pervades every part; in ſome it will even deſcend into the wings, and then an obliteration of all the tender marks and beautiful ſpecklings is the leaſt that may be expected, if a total change of its colours, to an uniform dirty brown, does not enſue. Hence it is that many of the Linnaean deſcriptions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects appear defective to ſuch as breed them; we not unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read, <hi>body black,</hi> though we know that part of the Inſect is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1109500100:50"/>white in every ſpecimen that is not greaſy; the body of the Satin Moth<note n="*" place="bottom">Pha. Salicis.</note> is perfectly white when fine, but after it has been killed ſome time, it becomes black in parts; the body of the Burnet Sphinx<note n="†" place="bottom">Sp. Filipendulae.</note> is of a very brilliant blue colour, with yellow bands on every annulation, when alive, but changes to a velvety black ſoon after the Inſect dies; the ſame is obſerved on the body of the Currant Sphinx<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sp. Tipuliformis.</note>; and every part of the body of the Hornet Sphinx<note n="§" place="bottom">Sp. Apiformis.</note> changes to a jet black, after being ſome time in the cabinet; although when alive it is a very bright yellow, with a band of purple. Hence alſo it is that ſome ſpecimens of very common Inſects are valuable, by having preſerved their proper colours uninjured.</p>
                  <p>Various methods have been tried to extract the greaſe from the Moths, but a preventative ſhould always be preferred.</p>
                  <p>If the greaſe has not ſpread into the wings, the Inſect may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be cured, but it will be very difficult, if not impoſſible, to eradicate the greaſe which has ſettled in patches on the wings.</p>
                  <p>Large Moths are to be opened in a ſtrait line along the under ſide of the body, the entrails, &amp;c. taken out, and the cavity filled with fine tow or cotton.—<hi>Note,</hi> This ſhould be performed ſoon after the Inſect is dead. The moſt delicate ſpecimens may be preſerved entire by this means; we have ſome very valuable Sphinges, Moths, &amp;c. which were collected by an intelligent perſon in <hi>North America;</hi> they retain their colours to the utmoſt degree of perfection, and have only been prevented from changing black by this ſimple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1109500100:51"/>Sometimes it will be proper to break off the body cloſe at the thorax, and ſubſtitute the body of another Inſect which nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles it, and which is not ſo liable to change.</p>
                  <p>The method which is moſt ſucceſsful for recovering the original appearance after the Inſect has become greaſy, is to powder ſome fine dry chalk, on a piece of heated iron; cover the chalk with a very fine linen cloth, and thereto apply the under part of the body of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect: the heat of the iron diſſolves the greaſe, while the chalk ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbs it, and the linen cloth prevents the chalk from clotting to the Inſect. This proceſs may be repeated ſeveral times if the greaſe is not entirely eradicated by the firſt attempt. Always-obſerve to exactly attemperate the heat of the iron.</p>
                  <p>They may be baked in a ſlack oven, with the chalk placed to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorb the greaſe, without any conſiderable injury to the colours.</p>

                  <p>Much experience, and conſiderable care, with a light, but ſteady hand, are neceſſary for the management of minute Moths on the ſetting board; it will be equally uſeleſs and impoſſible, to enter into a minute detail of every trivial circumſtance that muſt be attended to, we ſhall therefore give a general ſketch, and leave the reſt to the ingenuity of the operator.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the fans of the clappers, or forcepts, or the fowling-net if you prefer it, muſt be covered with ſilk gauſe, of a very ſoft and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1109500100:52"/>delicate texture, and as the ſlighteſt friction will obliterate the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſpecklings, or raiſed tufts that are ſo profuſely beſtowed by the hand of nature on this moſt elegant tribe of Inſects, you muſt be extremely careful when you preſs on the thorax not to cruſh it more than you can poſſibly avoid; or if you have it between the fans of the forceps, put the pin through the thorax while the creature is confined in that ſituation.</p>
                  <p>The next care will be to procure pins of ſuch a degree of fineneſs, as not to injure or diſtort the wings of the Inſect; the ſmalleſt ſort of lace pins will do very well for moſt kinds, but there are ſome ſo extremely minute that even thoſe would be too coarſe. If you have pins made purpoſely for Inſects of this kind, let them be about an inch in length, and have them drawn as fine as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>When the pin is put through the thorax it muſt be managed with the greateſt dexterity, and be exactly in the center, as the leaſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation to either ſide will break the nerves of the anterior margin of the upper wings, which will immediately ſtart, and can never be replaced in a proper poſition; if the pin is placed too high, it will ſever the head from the ſhoulders, and by being too low, the under wings alſo will break off or ſtart from their true poſition; it may be managed better with the aſſiſtance of a magnifying eye glaſs.</p>
                  <p>The braces are to be made of the ſame form as thoſe which are uſed for larger Inſects, only ſmaller in proportion; and inſtead of making them of ſtiff card, or paſteboard, they may be ſmall ſlips of vellum, or ſtout paper that has been hot-preſſed. You muſt brace them immediately after you have put the pin through the thorax, for if they are permitted to ſtiffen, they cannot be relaxed ſo well as larger Inſects.</p>

                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1109500100:53"/>Minute Moths are to be found in winter as well as ſummer; it would be ſcarcely imagined, nay reaſon would deny, did not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence prove, that when the froſt is ſo ſevere as to entirely ſubvert the appearance, and almoſt annihilate the exiſtence of all the vegetable productions, within the verge of its influence, myriads of thoſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately formed creatures brave the inclement ſeaſon, and exiſt ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within thoſe habitations they have the addreſs to conſtruct.</p>
                  <p>A very ſkilful Entomologiſt informs us that having occaſion to go into the country when the cold was intenſely ſevere and the ſnow deep, he collected in a few hours a vaſt number of minute Inſects of the <hi>Coleoptera, Hemiptera,</hi> and <hi>Lepidoptera</hi> orders; and though his collection was then very conſiderable he ſelected thirteen new ſpecies, and among them ſeveral which he has never found, but when the weather has been very cold as at that time.</p>
                  <p>It is proper to obſerve, that thoſe Inſects uſually ſhelter among the moſs, and other extraneous matter that grow on the trunks or branches of trees, or beneath the rotten bark. Gather the moſs, &amp;c. into a box, or tin canniſter, and ſhut it cloſe to prevent the eſcape of thoſe Inſects, that may revive by the warmth; when you have an opportunity to examine them, ſpread a ſheet of writing paper on the table, and place a lamp, or candle, with a ſhade of tranſparent, or oiled paper before you, ſo as to weaken the glare; then ſeparate the moſs, and ſhake it looſely in your hand, and you will perceive many Inſects fall down on the paper; if they are ſo minute that by thruſting the pin through the thorax they would be damaged, faſten them with gum water, or ſome glutinous varniſh, to ſmall ſlips or pieces of paper.</p>

                  <p>AMONG thoſe of the neuropterous order are included the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulae, a moſt elegant tribe of Inſects, but very difficult to preſerve. The colours on the body are exceedingly brilliant in ſome ſpecies, but inevitably change black within a few days after death, unleſs the collector is particularly attentive to their preparation.</p>
                  <p>They are extremely tenacious of life; we have ſeen one of the larger kinds live two days on the pin, and even ſhew ſymptoms of life twenty-four hours after being deprived of its head.</p>
                  <p>The moſt expeditious method of killing thoſe creatures, is to run a red hot wire up the body and thorax, for they will live a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time in agony if you attempt to kill them with aqua-fortis as before directed for the Moth tribe.</p>
                  <p>After they are dead, clean their bodies on the inſide with a little cotton twiſted to the end of a wire, and put a roll of white paper into the cavity, or fill it with cotton; in moſt ſpecies this will not only admirably relieve the colours, but preſerve them from chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing black.</p>

                  <head>APTEROUS INSECTS.</head>
                  <p>MANY kinds may be preſerved in ſpirits, or in the ſame manner as coleopterous and other Inſects; but among thoſe we can include very few, if any, of that extenſive genus ARANEA (Spiders), no method having been hitherto diſcovered whereby they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in their natural colours, for however beautiful they may be when alive, their bodies ſhrivel and their teints become an obſcure brown, ſoon after death; and as the moiſture exhales, the ſize of the body diminiſhes, very little more than the ſkin of it remaining when the creature is ſufficiently dry to be placed in the cabinet.</p>
                  <p>Spiders caſt their ſkins ſeveral times in the courſe of their lives; the exuviae would be very acceptable to the collector, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any of the beautiful colours of the living Spiders.</p>
                  <p>To determine whether ſome ſpecies of Spiders could be preſerved with their natural colours, I put ſeveral into ſpirit of wine; thoſe with gibbous bodies ſoon after diſcharged a very conſiderable quantity of viſcid matter, and therewith all their moſt beautiful colours; the ſmalleſt retained their form, and only appeared rather paler in the colours than when they were living.</p>
                  <p>During the courſe of laſt ſummer, among other Spiders I met with a rare ſpecies; it was of a bright yellow colour, elegantly marked with black, red, green, and purple; by ſome accident it was unfortunately cruſhed to pieces in the chip box wherein it was confined, and was therefore thrown aſide as uſeleſs; a month or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1109500100:57"/>more after that time, having occaſion to open the box, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that ſuch parts of the ſkin as had dried againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the box retained the original brightneſs of colour in a conſiderable degree; to further the experiment I made a ſimilar attempt with ſome caution, on the body of another Spider <hi>(Aranea Diadema),</hi> and though the colours were not perfectly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, they appeared diſtinct.</p>
                  <p>From other obſervations I find, that if you kill the Spider, and immediately after extract the entrails, then inflate them by means of a blow-pipe, you may preſerve them tolerably well; you muſt cleanſe them on the inſide no more than is ſufficient to prevent mouldineſs, leſt you injure the colours, which certainly in many kinds depend on ſome ſubſtance that lies beneath the ſkin.</p>
                  <p>After inflating them, you may either inject them with fine virgin wax, or anoint the ſkin with oil of ſpike in which reſin has been diſſolved, and dry them in ſome ſhady place.</p>
                  <p>Of the largeſt kinds of foreign Spiders, the bodies are the only parts which are liable to ſhrivel; if they were prepared in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner their proper form would be preſerved.</p>

Some collectors waſh the cork ſeveral times with ſpirit of wine and corroſive ſublimate, to deſtroy the mites; and moiſten the paper after it is paſted on the cork with allum-water.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that every crevice in the drawers or boxes muſt be ſtopped to prevent the admiſſion of external air, and always appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate a quantity of camphire for each drawer, or the mites will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Inſects.</p>

               <p>If you perceive notwithſtanding the camphire, a duſty appearance on the Inſects, add alſo a quantity of muſk, and clean the duſt off with a ſoft pencil; if after this you find more duſt, either bake the Inſects, or diſſolve ſome corroſive ſublimate in ſpirit of wine, and touch the parts that appear duſty with a fine pencil moiſtened in the liquor, which will deſtroy the mites that occaſion ſuch appearance.</p>

               <p>IN this order are included the whole tribe of ſhells according to the Linnaean arrangement; many diſputes having ariſen reſpecting the proper method of ſtudying the ſubject, Linnaeus made concho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy a branch of zoology, and not of mineralogy, as preceding authors had claſſed them; there however yet remain very ſtrong arguments againſt the method by the animals, although it cannot be denied that the ſhells are only the coverings or habitations, and ſhould not therefore demand our primary attention, or be conſidered as any farther uſeful in eſtabliſhing the mode of claſſification, than as ſubordinate diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>Fabius Columna was aſtoniſhed that of all the writers on this ſubject, not one had conſidered the animals that inhabit the ſhells, but owns, that many are ſeldom ſeen by us, and that to diſcover the manners of their life is extremely difficult.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adanſon alſo, in his Natural Hiſtory of Senegal, wiſhes to methodize teſtaceous animals by the Fiſh in preference to the ſhells. He obſerves, that there is ſuch an infinite variety of the <hi>Libot,</hi> or <hi>Black Limpet,</hi> that it is difficult to meet with two ſhells alike, and that any perſon would be led to conclude that they were diſtinct ſpecies, did not the fiſh or animal prove the contrary by admitting of no ſuch differences. The ſhells differed in colour and form; ſome were white, others grey, aſhen, or black; very flat, or very
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1109500100:62"/>raiſed; the number of furrows unequal, from twenty-five to fifty; ſometimes rigid, or ſet with ſmall prickles; the jaggings or tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Contour alſo differed widely, ſome being ſmall, or mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notches, while others were flaſht ſo deep, that they gave the whole ſhell the form of a ſtar with five or ſeven rays.</p>
               <p>Da Coſta, whoſe abilities as a concholiſt will require no eulogiurn, has however encountered the objections to claſs by the ſhells, and has convicted Adanſon of having confounded the <hi>Libot,</hi> or <hi>Black Limpet,</hi> with the <hi>Thorny Limpet,</hi> the <hi>Beauty,</hi> and the <hi>Aſtrolepas Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> all as one ſpecies, though they have not the leaſt reſemblance to each other. With reſpect to the fiſh, he allows with Adanſon, that being the ſame ſort is a preſumptive proof of their being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of the ſame ſpecies, but cannot agree that it is a poſitive or deciſive one. "I will allow him," ſays <hi>Da Coſta,</hi> "that the whole of the external appearance of the fiſh, and the particular parts are nearly the ſame; yet I think even that is not a poſitive proof, for I imagine, the very ſame kind of animal inhabits different covers or ſhells; as for example, the Snails may be the ſame kind of fiſh, and form the genus, yet vary ſo much in their habitations or ſhells, as to form different ſpecies of that ſame genus, from only the differences of the ſhells or coverings: for the ſhell or covering may be held for as great a character of the ſpecies, as the very fiſh. Thus the volutes called <hi>Admirals, Brocades, Purple Tips,</hi> or <hi>Onyxes, Tigers,</hi> &amp;c. though ſuch different ſhells may be inhabited by the ſame kind of fiſh, to wit, a <hi>Limax</hi> or <hi>Snail,</hi> and therefore though the <hi>Limax</hi> or <hi>Fiſh</hi> is of the very ſame kind, and forms or fixes the genus, yet the ſhells, always conſtant, will fix or define the ſpecies of that ſame genus. An analogy to this bears ſtrong through all the animal kingdom; for ſpecies of quadrupeds are diſtinguiſhed and defined in their genera, from the different colours of their hides;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1109500100:63"/>birds by their various plumage; and inſects by their different colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, therefore why ſhould not ſhells, which wear ſuch ſtrong cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, by the ſame parity of reaſon, form ſpecies of the ſame genus? Or in other words, why ſhould not the ſame fiſh, or genus, yield many different ſpecies, according to the ſeveral characteriſtical differences of its ſhells or habitations?"</p>
               <p>This author does not attempt to deny the propriety, but practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of claſſing by the animal; he juſtly obſerves, "The vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſpecies hitherto diſcovered, and the numerous collections made, exhibit only the ſhells or habitations, the animals themſelves being ſcarcely known or deſcribed. Of the ſhells we daily diſcover, few are fiſhed up living; the greater number are found on our ſhores dead and empty. Accurate deſcriptions of animals whoſe parts are not eaſily ſeen or obvious, and anatomical reſearches, are not in the capacity of every one to make; nor are the particular parts and their reſpective functions ſo eaſily cognizable to any but expert, aſſiduous, and philoſophical enquirers. How is it poſſible then to arrange a numerous ſet of animals by characters or parts, we can with difficulty, if ever, get acquainted with, in the far greater number of the ſpecies we collect or diſcover?"</p>

               <head>COLLECTING.</head>
               <p>LIKE all other kinds of animals, ſhell fiſh have their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reſorts; ſome inhabit only the deep parts of the ſea, ſome are found in leſs depths, others in ſhallows, in bays, and even on the ſhores; it has been alſo obſerved, that many very fine and rare ſpecimens are ſometimes found in narrow ſtraits between iſlands, and in ſhallows of four or five fathom water.</p>
               <p>The beſt live ſhells are collected by means of a trawling-net, ſuch as are uſed by fiſhermen, if the depths will permit; they are alſo brought up by the cable in weighing anchor, the log-line in ſounding, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After a ſtorm good ſhells may be picked up on the ſea beaches, or ſhores, as the violent agitation of the water in a tempeſt ſeparates them from their native beds, and often caſts them on the ſhore; but ſuch as have been expoſed for ſome time to the heat of the ſun, or beaten by the waves, are of little value, as their colours will be ſuded, and the ſhells worn and broken; chooſe therefore always ſuch ſhells as lie in the deepeſt parts of their reſorts and under water, whether taken up by the drag-net, from the ſides of rocks, or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of ſhips, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>River ſhells are in general very obſcure in appearance, ſeldom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of elegant colouting, and are extremely thin and brittle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1109500100:65"/>But terreſtrial or land ſhells, though few in compariſon with marine ſhells are no way deficient in beauty, or leſs eſteemed by collectors.</p>
               <p>Many ſhells are ſo very beautifully poliſhed when they are fiſhed up, that art cannot improve their appearance, ſuch are the Cowries, Tuns, ſome Buccina, the Volutes, and the Olives.</p>
               <p>Da Coſta imagines that the fiſh inhabiting all naturally poliſhed ſhells whatever are capable of not only adding to the extent and growth of their ſhells, but can likewiſe, from time to time, add a freſh poliſhed covering to the whole ſhell; or at leaſt extend their organs to ſuch a length as to clear away all impurities from their ſhells, as we ſeldom find any Cowries with coral or any extraneous bodies adhering to any part of them.</p>
               <p>As ſhells are of a calcareous nature, all acids muſt be avoided as much as poſſible; and even when the animals are killed, as much boiling may injure the ſhells, it with be moſt adviſable to dip them into ſealding water, which will kill them, let them remain for two or three minutes to cool, and then put them into cold water, in which they may lie until they are taken out to be cleaned. If the animals die without this precaution the colours will be very dull and obſcure, if not entirely changed.—Thoſe are known to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors by the term <hi>Dead Shells,</hi> and are little valued becauſe the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are ſo very much injured.</p>
               <p>The fiſh by being killed in this manner becomes condenſed, or ſomewhat ſolid, and may be picked out by any ſharp inſtrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1109500100:66"/>The epidermis, or perioſteum, is common to many ſhells, and is perhaps a membrane that covers the ſhells to defend them from exterior accidents, and aid their growth; its ſtructure in different genera varies very much; in ſome it is laminated, in others fibrous or bruſh-like, or as velvet; it prevents ſhell-fiſh or other marine inſects from fixing their habitation on thoſe ſhells, and protects it from the corroding of the ſalt water, for all ſhells that have the epidermis have a ſcabrous ſurface.</p>
               <p>Tellens, Muſcles, Snails, &amp;c. come out of the ſea ſlimy or even encruſted with filth, coraline matter, moſs, &amp;c. For theſe, firſt ſteep them in hot water, let them remain therein for twenty-four hours, to ſoften the filth or cruſt, then bruſh them well, with bruſhes that are not too hard; if that proves inſufficient to clean them, rub or bruſh them again with tripoli or emery, or put them into weak acid, obſerving to dip them into cold water every minute; ſtrong ſoap may alſo be uſed with a rag of woollen or linen, to rub them, and when cleaned finiſh them with a ſoft bruſh and fine emery.</p>
               <p>The ſcientific collectors ſhould always if poſſible preſerve one of every ſhell with the epidermis on, to exhibit its natural appearance, together with the uncoated ſpecimen.</p>
               <p>The epidermis may ſometimes be ſo thick that it will be proper to take it off, before the ſhell can be poliſhed, for that purpoſe pour a proportion (nearly one tenth) of aqua-fortis mixed with common water, into a ſhallow baſon or ſaucer, and place the ſhells therein, in ſuch a manner that the corroſive liquor may act only on the coat, without injuring the orifice, which in ſome caſes may be coated with bees-wax; change the ſituation of the ſhell every two or three
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1109500100:67"/>minutes, that all the parts may be equally uncoated; wipe off the bubbles as occaſion may require with a feather, firſt dipped in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: when you perceive the enamel of the ſhell in any part free from the coat, take it out and waſh it entirely free from the aqua-fortis; after this proceſs bruſh them with emery, putty, or tripoli.</p>
               <p>If inſtead of a thick epidermis it is only a pellicle, it is ſufficient to ſteep it in hot water, and then pick it off; or ſteep the ſhell in vinegar for ſome time till it peels off freely, or is corroded away.</p>
               <p>The epidermis of ſome ſhells is ſo very coarſe and ponderous as to reſiſt the corroſive quality of acids diluted, or even ſtrong aqua-fortis; coarſe emery, with ſtrong bruſhes, are then ſubſtituted, and ſeal-ſkin or pumice-ſtone is in ſeveral reſpects uſeful. If the matter is too obſtinate to be cleared off by this means, pour ſome ſpirit of nitre into a cup or other veſſel, ſtop up every part of the ſhell that may be ſuſceptible of injury, with ſoft wax as carefully as poſſible, and put it into the liquor in the veſſel; remove it every minute into cold water, but obſerve never to ſhift it into the ſame water more than once, and waſh it every time before you return it into the corroſive liquor. If the ſhell is warted, irregular, or arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with points, examine with a common magnifying glaſs, and if you perceive on the more prominent parts through the coat any appearance of the poliſhed ſurface, cover them with wax, and let the ſhell remain a few moments longer in the ſpirit; take it out and waſh it again, after which poliſh the ſhell with fine emery, and paſs a camel's hair pencil with gum arabic over them to glow the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; white of egg is ſometimes uſed, but it is very apt to turn yellow in time, though at firſt it appears glaring; and varniſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates a diſagreeable ſmell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1109500100:68"/>Some ſhells have naturally a ſlight politure, though dull; thoſe muſt be rubbed by the hand with chamois leather, which will give them a bright gloſſy appearance; avoid when poſſible the uſe of powder of emery, as it is apt to detriment the beautiful working on the ſhells; it cannot however be often left out of uſe.</p>
               <p>It may be neceſſary as far as can be, to avoid the impoſitions which are often practiſed on thoſe who are not well acquainted with ſhells; at the ſame time that the collector may wiſh to enrich his cabinet with ſpecimens under their ſeveral appearances: thus we ſee that though the outer ſurface of the common Cowry, or Tide Shell, is of a pale colour with dark ſpots, when that is taken off, it is of a fine violet colour; the Sea Ears are clouded with brown, green, and white, but when that coat is rubbed away, it appears a beautiful mother of pearl, and the pearly chambered Nautilus, or Sailor, is of a light ochre colour, variegated with ſtreaks of red, externally, but when that coat is rubbed off, the ſhell is mother of pearl alſo; the ſame circumſtance attends many of the Trochi, Snails, and an infinite variety of other ſhells of different genera. Among thoſe ſhells which alter their appearance moſt, we muſt not omit the Volute, called by us the <hi>Purple</hi> or <hi>Violet Tip,</hi> and by the French the <hi>Onyx;</hi> it has a brown epidermis, which being taken off diſcovers the ground colour to be a dull yellow. When this is worked down to beneath the cruſt or ſurface, it is of a pure white, with the tip of a fine violet colour.—To rub them down in this manner uſe a file, hard bruſhes of boar's briſtles, coarſe emery, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Dutch frequently ſtain artificial colours on ſhells, ſo as to render it extremely difficult to prevent impoſition; ſometimes they entirely alter their appearance, by filing the mouths, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1109500100:69"/>To examine the internal ſtructure of ſhells, they may be ground down on a hone.</p>
               <p>Foſſil ſhells ſhould be noticed here if any inſtructions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for their preſervation, but they, together with minerals, are the moſt durable part of a collection; being either chalky, caſts of ſtone, or replacements of ſparry matter, with perhaps only ſome ſlight fragments of the ſhells adhering. They are dug out of lime, or ſtone quarries, coal pits, chalky cliffs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The remains of foreign animals, ſhells, and plants which have at different periods been diſcovered in a foſſil ſtate, within the bowels of the earth, in Europe, has been ſuppoſed to exceed the variety and number of thoſe in a recent ſtate, or in preſent exiſtence with us; and although <hi>Buffon</hi> will not allow ſuch a conſiderable latitude to this circumſtance, he acknowledges that foſſils are extremely numerous in Europe as well as in every other part of the univerſe, and appears ſatisfied that ſhells, &amp;c. may be diſcovered wherever we are diſpoſed to ſeek for them.</p>
               <p>Strata of ſhells have been found at the greateſt depths from the ſurface of the earth that have ever been examined, and in equal abundance on the ſummits of the higheſt mountains, for example, on mount Cenis, in the mountains of Genes, in the Apennines, and in moſt of the ſtone and marble quarries in Italy; in the marbles of the moſt ancient buildings of the Romans; in the mountains of Tirol; in the center of Italy, on the ſummit of mount Paterne, near Bologne; in the hills of Calabria, and in many parts of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Hungary, &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1109500100:70"/>In Aſia and Africa they have been obſerved by travellers in many parts; on the mountains of Caſtravan above Barut there is a bed of white ſtone as thin as ſlate, each leaf of which contains a great number and diverſity of fiſhes; they lie for the moſt part very flat, and compreſſed, as do the foſſil of fern-plants, but they are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo well preſerved that the ſmalleſt traces of the fins, ſcales, and all the parts which diſtinguiſh each kind are perfectly viſible.

               <p>"Oppoſite the village of Inchene, and on the eaſtern ſhore of the Nile, are found petrified plants, which grow naturally in a ſpace about two leagues long, by a very moderate breadth; this is one of the moſt ſingular productions of nature. Theſe plants reſemble the white coral found on the Red Sea<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage of Paul Lucus, Vol. II. p. 380.</note>."</p>
               <p>"There are petrifactions of divers kinds on mount Libanus, and among others flat ſtones, where the ſkeletons of fiſh are found well preſerved and entire; red cheſnuts, and ſmall branches of coral, the ſame as grow in the Red Sea, are alſo found on this mountain."</p>
               <p>According to Dr. Woodward, foſſil ſhells are met with from the tops to the bottoms of quarries, pits, and the deepeſt mines of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary; and Mr. Ray aſſures us, they are found a thouſand feet deep in the rocks which border the Iſle of Calda in Pembrokeſhire in England.</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1109500100:71"/>We would willingly purſue our enquiries farther, were they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to our general deſign, but as we only wiſh to acquaint the early naturaliſt, in what ſituations he may expect to meet with foſſil ſhells, or the remains of animals, &amp;c. we ſhall return to our own country, which abounds in productions of the foſſil kind.</p>
               <p>The greateſt variety of ferns, and other foſſil plants, in iron-ſtone, are found at Coalbrook Dale, Shropſhire; ammonites, &amp;c. in Kent, Dorſetſhire, Glouceſterſhire, Cornwall, Bath, &amp;c. and foſſil ſhells in general are abundant in chalky cliffs, and clay ſoil. To convey ſome idea of the extenſive variety of foſſil ſhells, &amp;c. in this country, it will be only neceſſary to mention the <hi>Foſſilia Hantonienſia,</hi> the figures contained in that work amount to one hundred and twenty-one different kinds, although they were only collected in the county of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> out of the cliffs by the ſea coaſt, between <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> and <hi>Lymington,</hi> and about the cliffs by the village of <hi>Hordwell,</hi> which is nearly in the mid way between the two former places; they were found in their natural ſtate, excepting their loſs of colour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly well preſerved, below a ſtratum of gravel and ſand about fourteen or fifteen feet thick, in a bluiſh kind of clay or marle, quite down to the level of the ſea, how much deeper is not known; the heights of theſe cliffs are, in many places, above one hundred feet.</p>
               <p>We cannot better conclude this diſcourſe, than by ſubjoining the following extract from the preface of that work.</p>
               <p>"This ſtratum of clay runs a great way into the country in a northerly direction quite acroſs the <hi>New Foreſt,</hi> as may be perceived when ſinkings are made in the earth for buildings, or pits for the digging of marle, where foſſil ſhells, on ſuch occaſions, frequently
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1109500100:72"/>occur, together with thoſe other bodies here mentioned, by which it appears, that along with the teſtaceous tribe, fiſh and quadrupeds became involved in the general confuſion; the ſhores under theſe cliffs abound with large noddules of iron ore, and pebbles or flints, in many of which when broken are diſcovered foſſil ſhells, or their impreſſions, and the eſcharae here deſcribed.</p>
               <p>"Various are the opinions concerning the time when and how theſe bodies became depoſited; ſome there are who conceive it might have been effected in an indefinite length of time by a gradual chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſea; others again, that this globe may have undergone many, even total revolutions, of which we neither have or can have any idea, but by theſe traces.</p>
               <p>"The moſt common cauſe aſſigned is that of the deluge, but the notion that an overflowing of the waters, during the time men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ſcripture, although the univerſality of it ſhould not be called in queſtion, could have looſened the intire contents of the whole earth, according to Dr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> and have rendered all that was ſolid, fluid, for the admiſſion of the ſpoils both of the ſea and land, into the centre of the hardeſt rocks, nay even pebbles and flints, is equally hypothetical with other conjectures; ſo that upon the whole, I am apt to think this affair will for ever remain a myſtery. I ſhall therefore content myſelf with making a few general obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the ſubject, the better to enable ſuch as are leſs converſant in theſe matters to judge for themſelves.</p>
               <p>"Theſe phaenomena then, upon an inquiſitive ſearch over as great a part of the globe as we have any knowledge of, except in a very few inſtances, are found to be univerſal; for from the ſurface of the higheſt mountains in the moſt inland parts, down to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

               <p>M. de Juſſieu imagines, that as the bed of the ſea is continually riſing in conſequence of the mud and ſand which the rivers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly convey there; the ſea, at firſt confined between two nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row dykes, ſurmounted them and was diſperſed over the land, and that the dykes were themſelves undermined by the water and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown therein; hence he accounts for the impreſſions of ſo many exotic vegetables on the ſtones of St. Chaumont, in France; which are all either natives of the Eaſt Indies, or the hot climates of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and are not to be found in the recent ſtate in any part of France.</p>

               <p>We often obſerve at the bottoms of ſhallow pools, or on the plants which grow in, or recline on the ſurface of ſtagnant water, a number of ſmall tranſparent lumps, about the ſize of a pea, and ſlatted on one ſide; thoſe are Polypes in an inactive ſtate: they are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1109500100:75"/>generally fixed by one end to ſome ſolid ſubſtance, at the other end is an opening, which is the mouth of the creature, and the arms ſhoot forth round it in the form of rays.</p>
               <p>They are generally found in waters that move gently; neither rapid ſtreams, nor ſtagnant waters ever abound with them; they adhere to aquatic plants, to rotten wood, ſtones, &amp;c. They are ſeldom met with in winter, but in the month of May they begin to appear, and are to be found in ditches all the ſummer.</p>
               <p>When you ſearch for Polypes it will be beſt to take up a quantity of the pieces of wood, &amp;c. that are uſually found in ditches, and put them into a glaſs of water, let it ſtand for a while without moving it, and if there are any Polypes adhering to theſe ſubſtances, you will perceive them ſtretching out their arms in ſearch for their prey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trembley diſcovered that a ſmall ſpecies of Millepede was an excellent food for thoſe little animals; they will alſo devour the Pulices Aquatices, the ſmall red worms which are found in the mud banks on the banks of the Thames, common worms, the larva of gnats, and other inſects, and even butcher's meat if cut ſmall enough.</p>

               <p>"Chuſe a proper Polype, and put in a ſmall concave lens, with a drop of water; when it is extended, and the tail fixed, pour off a little of the water, and then plunge it with the concave into ſome ſpirit of wine contained in the bowl of a large ſpoon; by this it is inſtantly killed, the arms and body contracting more or leſs; rub it gently, while in ſpirits, with a ſoft hair pencil, to cleanſe it from the lice.</p>

               <p>PLANTS are ſometimes tranſmitted from one country to another, by ſlips or cuttings, but as thoſe require the ſkilful management of the gardener during the paſſage, roots or ſeeds ſhould always be preferred. It is, however, very difficult to lay down any preciſe mode of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will anſwer for all ſeeds indiſcriminately: ſome kinds keep beſt expoſed to the air; while others are preſerved by a total excluſion of it<note n="*" place="bottom">Miller's Gardeners Dictionary.</note>.

               <p>In <hi>Ellis</hi>'s directions for bringing over ſeeds and plants, the neceſſity of giving freſh air to ſome ſeeds is clearly proved<note n="†" place="bottom">"A gentleman going to Bencoulen in the iſland of Sumatra, had a mind to furniſh himſelf with an aſſortment of ſeeds for a kitchen garden; theſe were accordingly packed up in boxes and caſks, and ſtowed with the other goods in the hold of the ſhip.
<p>"When he arrived at Bencoulen, he ſowed his ſeeds; but ſoon found to his grent mortification that they were all ſpoiled, for none of them came up.</p>
                     <p>"Convinced that it muſt be owing to the heat of the ſhip's hold, and their long confinement in putrid air, and having ſome occaſion to return to England, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in his next voyage thither to pack them up in ſuch a manner, and place them ſo as to give them as much air as he could, without the danger of expoſing them to the ſalt water; and therefore put the ſmaller kinds into ſeparate papers, and placed them among ſome clean ſtraw in a ſmall cloſe net, and hung it up in his cabin; and the larger ones he put into boxes, ſtowing them where the free air could come at them, and blow through them: the effect was, that as ſoon as he arrived at Bencoulen he ſowed them, and in a little time found, to his great ſatisfaction, that they grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well."</p>
                  </note>, though it is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1109500100:80"/>certain that the vegetative power of many other kinds can only be preſerved by a total excluſion of air, as coating them with wax or encloſing them in tin canniſters, &amp;c.<note n="‡" place="bottom">This method "principally conſiſts in chooſing ſuch ſeeds as are perfectly ſound and ripe. To prove this, we muſt cut open ſome of them to judge what ſituation the reſt may be in, taking care to lay aſide any that are outwardly defective or marked with the wounds of inſects. When a proper choice of them is made, they ſhould be wiped extremely clean to prevent any dirt or moiſture being encloſed; each ſeed ſhould then be rolled up carefully in a coat of ſoft bees-wax, half an inch thick: the deep Engliſh bees-wax is the beſt. When you have covered the number you intend to encloſe, pour ſome of this bees-wax melted into a chip box of ſix or ſeven inches long, four broad, and three deep, till it is above half full; and juſt before it begins to harden, while it is yet fluid, put in the ſeeds you have rolled up in rows till the box is near full; then pour over them ſome more wax while it is juſt fluid, taking care when it is cold to flop all the cracks or chinks that may have proceeded from the ſhrinking of the wax, with ſome very ſoft wax; then put on the cover of the box, and keep it in as cool and airy a place as you can.
<p>"Acorns ſo preſerved have vegetated freely after they have been kept a whole ſeaſon encloſed in wax.</p>
                     <p>"Another method that has been tried with ſucceſs is, by procuring the tea-ſeeds in their pods or capſules, when they are brought down freſh from the tea country, at the latter end of the year, to Canton, at the time that our Eaſt-India ſhips are preparing to depart for Europe. The ſeeds then in their pods are to be put into pound or half-pound caniſters made of tin and tutenague, with a double rim to the top: the inſide of the caniſter ſhould be firſt lined with ſilk paper, or the paper commonly uſed in China, and the ſeeds preſſed down cloſe, but not ſo as to be bruiſed. When the caniſter is near full to the neck, ſome more of the ſame paper muſt be ſtuffed in very cloſe, till it is full to the top, and then the double-rimmed cover ſhould be put on very tight. Care muſt be taken that the ſeeds are not too moiſt when they are put into the caniſter, and that they are found and in good order. The caniſter then is to be kept in an airy cool place. If the ſhip arrives early in England, I mean in July, they may be ſown with ſucceſs; the ſooner it is done, the better chance we ſhall have of their growing. Thoſe ſeeds which I have ſeen brought over in this manner, had ſhot out roots owing to the heat of the climates they had paſſed through, and the confined moiſture; and though not twenty out of two hundred in the caniſter ſucceeded, yet theſe are thought a great acquiſition.</p>
                     <p>"The ſmalleſt feeds being very liable to loſe their vegetative power by long voyages through warm climates, it may be worth while to try the following experiment upon ſuch kinds as we know for certain are ſound. Dip ſome ſpare pieces of cotton cloth in melted wax, and whilſt it is ſoft, and almoſt cold, ſtrew the ſurface of each piece over with each ſort of ſmall ſeed, then roll them up tight, and encloſe each roll in ſome ſoft bees-wax, wrapping up each of them in a piece of paper, with the name of the ſeed on it."—ELLIS'S <hi>Directions for bringing over Seeds and Plants.</hi>

Cover the bottom with ſoft long wet moſt, about an inch or two thick, and lay the plants with their tops towards the ends of the box as cloſe as poſſible, about two inches deep: cover them with a layer of wet moſs, inch deep, and proceed with another layer of plants, and ſo on until the whole of the box is filled, covering the upper layer of all with wet moſs in like manner. If ſome moſs is alſo added to the ends of the box the better, as their being preſſed cloſe down in the box does not damage or injure them; many by ſo doing may be packed in a ſmall ſpace. Nail on the top of the box and immerſe it under water in a pond, river, or tub, for a few minutes to admit it into the moſs; it may then be kept in any damp cellar or out-houſe free from harm, until ſent on board ſhip, and requires no further trouble, but once in five or ſix weeks to pour ſome freſh water on the top or bottom, through the holes, to moiſten the moſs within. In this manner vaſt quantities of ſcarce and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable plants may be eaſily tranſported from one part of the globe to another. Although I have never yet made the experiment myſelf, I am confident that all kinds of nuts, and hard ſeeds, may be ſent in this manner from place to place with great probability of ſecurity and ſucceſs; as the vegetative part of the ſeed, by being nouriſhed by the moiſture of the moſs, will be ſurer preſerved, than by any other mode I have heard of.

                  <p>Mr. Lindſay, as being an aſſiſtant to Dr. Clarke, botaniſt for that iſland, could not be ignorant of the various opinions which were entertained by botaniſts reſpecting the fructification of this tribe of plants, and of the difficulty of raiſing them from the ſeeds; having ſome ſpare time when he arrived at Jamaica which he could with propriety dedicate to a minute obſervance of thoſe plants, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to aſcertain their ſeed; their minuteneſs rendered every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſcover them, by ſearching at the roots of even the ſmalleſt viſible plants fruitleſs, he then thought of ſowing the powder or duſt which falls from the leaves when drying in a flower-pot, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their progreſs; to do this with care and certainty he mixed ſome of the powder with ſome of the mould it was to be ſown in, and by the aſſiſtance of the microſcope was ſoon able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the different parts of the powder, or fructification from the mould in which it was ſown. He next proceeds to relate the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he obſerved in the ſeeds of ſeveral ſpecies, from the firſt ſymptoms of vegetation to the expanſion of the leaves, and illuſtrates the progreſs by ſeveral figures and ſuitable references. Engaging in the practice of medicine ſoon after, he thought no more of the ſubject, till he had the honour of a very polite letter from Sir Joſeph Banks, Bart. by which he was induced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his obſervations, and tranſmit his valuable diſcovery to England.</p>

Theſe leaves, laid on clean paper in a dry place, ſoon ſhed their ſeed in the form of duſt or fine powder, of colour varying from black or brown to yellow; the groſſer part of this powder is the empty capſules, and that very fine part which adheres cloſe to the paper is the ſeed. The ſeeds thus procured may be ſown immediately, or kept in paper in a dry place."</p>
                  <p>He next determines, that like other vegetables, many ſpecies of Ferns requires a ſoil and ſituation peculiar to themſelves; he took equal parts of brick mould and good pit marle, at ſome depth below the ſurface, to avoid the ſeeds of other plants, mixed them well together, and with this filled the flower-pot, moiſtened it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and made the ſurface very ſmooth; he then divided it into ſmall ſpaces, according to the number of the different kinds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſown in it; and laſtly ſtrewed the ſeeds lightly on the ſurface.

               <head>OBSERVATIONS <hi>On the Manner of making a</hi> HORTUS-SICCUS.</head>
               <p>The Abbé Hauy, of the royal academy of ſciences at Paris, in the year 1785, preſented that ſociety with the following intereſting obſervations, relative to the preſervation of dried plants.</p>
               <p>"Of all the productions of nature, there are none more ſuſceptible of change than vegetables, or which require more care and attention for their preſervation. Flowers, in particular, ſoon loſe their colours in an herbal, and aſſume others, quite different from thoſe beſtowed on them by nature. Yellow grows pale, or becomes nearly effaced; blue or red are ſtill more apt to fade or diſappear entirely. The flowers of the Violet, the Campanula, of ſeveral ſpecies of Gera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, and a multitude of other plants which add to the ornament of the fields, and often to that even of our gardens, become, in a few days ſo much tarniſhed, that they cannot be known by any eye but that of an experienced botaniſt.</p>
               <p>"This inconvenience I have endeavoured to remedy, at leaſt, in part; and as I found it almoſt impoſſible to fix the natural colours of plants, I attempted to diſcover a method of ſubſtituting artificial colours for them which might not fade, ſo that the flower, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving its bloom, and all its eſſential characteriſtics, might in ſome degree exhibit its natural colour. For this purpoſe, I painted a piece of fine paper with water colours in ſuch a manner as to have, as much as poſſible, the ſame degree of ſtrength as thoſe of nature,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1109500100:87"/>only a little fainter, for a reaſon I ſhall mention hereafter. When I had done this I threw the leaves into ſpirits of wine, where they ſoon loſt all their colours, and were reduced to whitiſh tranſparent membranes. After having dried them thoroughly, by preſſing them between two folds of a fine cloth, I laid them on the coloured paper by means of a thick varniſh, which I took care to ſpread over the paper in order that they might adhere to it, I afterwards drew another paper, ſeveral times over the flower preſſing it ſtrongly with my hand until all the leaves were properly applied, and until the artificial colours appeared through them. In this operation the colours become a little darker; for which reaſon it will be neceſſary to make the tints a little fainter than what they are naturally. I afterwards left the flower a few moments in a preſs, then, having cut the paper around it, I applied it with a diſſolution of gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arabic to the place it ſhould occupy on the plant, which had been before fixed by means of the ſame diſſolution to a piece of paper of a proper ſize.</p>
               <p>"It will be of great ſervice when thoſe flowers even are applied, which have permanent colours, ſuch as the greater part of the wild Ranunculuſes, to begin by cementing the flowers to a piece of paper, and to cut it round the leaves, as in the preceding caſe, before they are added to the plant. This operation renders them more natural, and if their poſition is ſuch that they cover the leaves of the plant, which will often happen, the colour of the leaves does not injure that of the flowers, by appearing through their delicate membraness, which are in part diaphonous.</p>
               <p>"There are ſome plants, the leaves of which, on account of their thickneſs and ſpongy ſubſtance, cannot eaſily be dried, and which become black before their juices have been extracted by the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1109500100:88"/>ordinary mode of drying. Such, among others, are thoſe of the orchis. I have obſerved that by peeling off, with a pointed knife, the thin pellicle which covers the lower part of theſe leaves, before I cemented them to the paper, it greatly haſtened their deſiccation, ſo that it generally took place in two or three days, and even in a much ſhorter ſpace of time. The leaves then preſerved their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in a great meaſure, or, at leaſt, aſſumed only a tint inclining a very little to yellow, without ever appearing of that black colour which indicates the laſt degree of decay in a ſpecies of productions the moſt beautiful and pleaſing in nature.</p>
               <p>"I have ſubmitted to the inſpection of the academy the Violet, the Geranium, and the common Poppy of the fields, the artificial colours of which have preſerved their luſtre for many years, I have added alſo three ſpecies of orchis, the leaves of which ſtill retain their freſhneſs after being dried ten years, the ſummer Adonis and common Cinque Foil, &amp;c. the natural colours of which have been preſerved without any other precaution than the care I took to dry them between folds of warm paper as ſpeedily as I poſſibly could, and not to expoſe them to the air, or to moiſture."</p>
               <p>This method may be applied to moſt plants, with the greateſt proſpect of ſucceſs; but as the time it will require to preſerve only a few ſpecimens may be more than every collector can ſpare, a more ſimple proceſs is recommended; dry the plants between the leaves of a large book, or ſheets of ſtout paper, and preſs them even in a ſcrew-preſs, or let them remain under a heavy weight for ſome time; then ſpread a thin coat of gum-arabic on the paper, and diſplay the plants thereon as ſmooth as poſſible. They ſhould after this be covered with a thin coat of copal varniſh to preſerve them from the ravages of infects, or the ill effects of damp.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1109500100:89"/>Plants loſe all their native verdure in ſpirit of wine, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their form perfectly well, if therefore they are preſerved on account of the ſingular ſtructure of any part, it is beſt to keep them in bottles, with either ſpirit of wine, rum, or brandy, &amp;c. Spirit of wine diluted with common water will preſerve the colours of ſome plants tolerably well.</p>
               <p>The moſt intereſting diſcourſe we have met with on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of vegetables, is that which Dr. Withering communicated to the Linnaean Society in December, 1794; it is inferted as the 23d article of the ſecond volume of the Tranſactions of that Society. Dr. Withering has confined his diſcourſe to the preſervation of Fungi, only obſerving that Moſſes and Lichens might be preſerved in great perfection by the ſame methods.</p>
               <p>He obſerves that acids, even thoſe of a mineral origin, are apt to produce mouldineſs; that neutral ſalts often deſtroy the texture of the plants; though perhaps a weak ſolution of common ſalt, with a ſufficient quantity of ſpirit of wine, might be uſed advantageouſly for the preſervation of Fuci, and other marine vegetables. Earthy ſalts ſeem uſeleſs, except alum, which preſerves them tolerably well for a time, but at length they are apt to become mouldy.</p>
               <p>For the preparation of the liquors No. 1 and No. 2, which he found moſt efficacious, he has given the following directions. No. 1. "To half a pound of vitriol of copper, called blue vitriol, reduced to powder, add a pint of cold water: ſtir them together for a minute, and then throw away the water: upon the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vitriol pour half a pint of boiling water: and ſtir them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently until the liquor be nearly cool. Set it by in a warm place, for two or three days, to cryſtallize.</p>

               <p>"To two or three quarts of pure ſpring water, put as much of this ſolution of blue vitriol as will give the whole a very ſlight bluiſh tinge: then add to it, rectified ſpirit of wine, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a pint to a gallon: filter the liquor through blotting or cap paper, and put it into bottles for uſe."</p>
               <p>"No. 2. Diſſolve a quarter of an ounce of ſugar of lead in a pint of diſtilled or very pure ſpring water, made boiling hot; add ſeven pints of pure cold water, and one pint of rectified ſpirit of wine: filter the liquor, and keep it in bottles."</p>
               <p>"The above proportion of ſpirit of wine is ſufficient for the thickeſt and moſt ſucculent ſpecimens, but leſs will do for ſuch as are thick and not juicy. If the ſpirit be ſufficient to prevent mouldineſs, it is enough, for more has a tendency to extract the colours."</p>
               <p>"Put the ſpecimens into wide-mouthed jars made of flint glaſs, and well fitted with corks: fill the jars quite full with one or other of the above liquids, ſo as to leave in as little air as poſſible: cork the jars very cloſe, covering the corks with tin foil, or ſheet lead, ſuch as may be had from the dealers in tea, turning the edge of the lead or tin downwards ſo as to lap over and under the edge of the jar.</p>
               <p>"The dark-coloured plants are very apt to diſcolour the liqour, the milky ones to render it turbid, and ſome of the juicy ones to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1109500100:91"/>excite the vinous fermentation. In any of theſe caſes the liquor muſt be repeatedly changed.</p>
               <p>"I have principally uſed the liquor No. 1; but No. 2 is beſt adapted to preſerve ſome of the more tender colours, and it alſo keeps the texture more firm. Let the botaniſt however be careful not to mix the liquors, not to change one for the other after a plant has been wetted with one of them."</p>
               <p>Dr. Withering in the courſe of this diſſertation has alſo given ſome inſtructions for the tranſportation of Agarics; his method is nearly the ſame as that preſcribed by Colonel Davies for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of ſhrubs and plants in general, except that he adviſes to put the plants and moſs in layers into an earthen jar, inſtead of an open box; and to pour in the liquid No. 1, as long as the layers of moſs, between the plants, will continue to imbibe any; then to ſtop up the mouth ſecurely.</p>
