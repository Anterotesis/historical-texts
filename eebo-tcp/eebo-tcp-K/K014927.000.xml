            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Editor of Mr. SHERIDAN'S
Speech, which has been collected with
great diligence, and corrected with great
attention, will make no apology for giving to
the world the celebrated Oration, which all the
world could not poſſibly hear. For arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of matter, acuteneſs of obſervation, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of ſarcaſm, and pathos of expreſſion, this
Speech, which excited expectation without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,
has been ſeldom ſurpaſſed, and
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0301701200:3"/>
ſeldomer equalled. It is, however, fair for
Mr. Haſtings's friends to requeſt, that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be ſuſpended till the other ſide ſhall
be heard; ſince brilliancy of eloquence, and
cogency of proof have very different effects on
judicious minds.</p>

            <p>THE Court being ſeated preciſely at twelve o'clock,
MR. SHERIDAN aroſe.—It would be ſuperfluous,
he obſerved, for him to call the attention of their
Lordſhips to the magnitude and importance of the ſubject
before them; to advert to the parties who were engaged in
the buſineſs; or to depict the ſituation of thoſe multitudes
who were ultimately to be affected. All this had already
been done by the Hon. Gentleman (Mr. Burke) who opened
the proſecution;—by him, who, alone, was equal to the
taſk;—by him, to whom mankind was indebted for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied
ſtand, which was now made in defence of the general
rights of humanity.—Neither was it his intention to enter
into any detail which might be deemed foreign to the quef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
immediately before the Court:—he would only indulge
himſelf in a few words reſpecting ſome inſinuations which
had been thrown out againſt the perſons concerned in this
proſecution. It had been whiſpered, by whom he could not
ſay, that there was ſomething malicious, and ſomething,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0301701200:5"/>
perhaps, too violent in the manner in which it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted.
Speaking for himſelf, and as far as the heart of
man could be known, for the other managers appointed by
the Commons, he would boldly aſſert, that they had acted
ſolely from conviction; not a conviction born in error, and
nurſed by prejudice; but a conviction founded on deliberate
and well-grounded enquiry;—that they had proceeded, not as
rejoicing in puniſhment, but impelled by a ſanguine hope of
remedy.—Perſonal malice! God forbid that they ſhould
indulge ſuch a ſenſation againſt the unfortunate gentleman
at the bar; but how, when they were to ſpeak of Rapine,
of Cruelty, and of Extortion, could ſuch ideas be conveyed
but in conſonant language? There was undoubtedly a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between Impeachment for capital Crimes, and thoſe
for Miſdemeanours only. In proceedings on the former,
every latitude had been indulged by uſage, every aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was employed, and every act of the Priſoner tortured
into Criminality. No ſuch privilege was claimed by the
managers on the preſent occaſion; but yet it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
by thoſe, whoſe pity ſeemed to riſe in proportion
with the guilt of its object;—that if ſuch a mode of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was admiſſible in the former Caſe, where the life of the
Priſoner was affected, it was ſtill more juſtifiable on an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
like the preſent; where the utmoſt conſequences
of guilt, when proved, would be but a <hi>ſplendid excluſion</hi> of
the Criminal from that Society which he had injured, or a
<hi>trifling deduction</hi> from the ſpoils of a long continued Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It had been obſerved what was undoubtedly true, that no
complaint from the natives of India had been preſented in
the courſe of theſe proceedings. Thoſe, however, who were
firſt to make this obſervation, were fully convinced that
meekneſs in ſuffering was there a part of the national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
and that their terrors had been too deeply impreſſed,
not to be long remembered. But though a deſpair of Britiſh
Juſtice had prevailed through that Peninſula;—though their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0301701200:6"/>
ſubdued hearts could not even hope for relief;—yet their
claims on the Juſtice and Humanity of their Lordſhips were
not thereby diminiſhed, but recommended. He would not
mention this Deſpair, without accompanying the obſervation
by proof; he therefore read Extracts from two Letters, the
firſt, lately received from Lord <hi>Cornwallis</hi>; the ſecond, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
from Captain Kirkpatrick to his Lordſhip: from both
which it appeared, that ſuch was the prevailing ſenſe through
India, of the injuries inflicted by the Engliſh, and of their
repeated violations of every compact, that it would be long
indeed before their confidence in Engliſh faith, or their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
on Engliſh juſtice, could again be reſtored.</p>
            <p>To theſe complaints their Lordſhips were now to anſwer,
not by profeſſions, but by facts;—not by remedial acts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to the future, but by an exemplary puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on paſt delinquency. It was incumbent on them to
ſhew to the oppreſſed natives of India, and to future Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
and Judges, that there could be no authority ſo high,
no office ſo ſacred, as not to be ſubject to the paramount
power of Britiſh Juſtice.—He did not, however, mean to
ſay, that the Example ſhould be made, unleſs the Guilt was
firſt fully proved: No, God forbid, that in this free and
juſt land, legal proof and legal guilt ſhould ever be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated!
—Though the greater part of the Evidence on this
occaſion had been, with a few exceptions, wrung from the
unrelenting accomplices of the priſoner—from men who had
partook of the ſpoils, and were involved in the guilt; yet
had he therefore no indulgence to demand, nor had he to
requeſt that the Court ſhould take that as evidence on this
occaſion, which on any other they might deem themſelves
bound to refuſe. He, on the contrary, was now to bring
forward to their Lordſhips a Maſs of Evidence, as full, as
ſtrong, as competent, and as concluſive, as ever eſtabliſhed
the guilt of a criminal, or ever brought conviction home to
the breaſts of conſcientious Judges. In the performance of
this taſk, he obſerved, he ſhould have the leſs difficulty, as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0301701200:7"/>
their Lordſhips had attended to the whole, voluminous and
complicated as it appeared, with a diligence which did
honor to their feelings, and ſhewed their individual ſenſe of
the dignity of that high Tribunal, which they collectively
formed.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of this Evidence, to which he ſhould call
the attention of the Court, was the Defences delivered in
by Mr. Haſtings to the Houſe of Commons, and to their
Lordſhips. On theſe, as being the voluntary admiſſions of
the Priſoner, unextorted by any threat, and unbiaſſed by
any perſuaſion, much ſtreſs had undoubtedly been laid. To
a part of theſe, however, an objection had been made, the
moſt extraordinary, perhaps, that had ever been advanced in
a Court of Criminal Juſtice:—an objection which, when
Mr. Haſtings was well adviſed, as he undoubtedly was—
when he was ſaved from his own <hi>raſh Guidance,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers
could ſcarcely have expected. This objection was,
that a Part of the <hi>firſt</hi> Defence in particular, not having
been written by Mr. Haſtings, but by ſome of his friends,
that Gentleman was not bound by any admiſſions therein
contained. Mr. Haſtings, on appearing at the Bar of the
Houſe of Commons, had pleaded the haſte in which he had
written, in palliation of his inaccuracies; he had even made
a merit of doing that himſelf, which would be leſs dangerous
if he had committed it to another!—But now, ſaid Mr.
Sheridan, that he finds that there is ſomething more than
inaccuracy—ſomething fraught with that actual danger
which he had apprehended—he reverts to that plea which he
had abandoned, and declares that he had committed the
truſt to others!—He diſclaims all his former merits, and
avers that, in making up his tale, he had not truſted ſolely
to his own powers,—that he had put his <hi>Memory</hi> into <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi>
and <hi>parcelled</hi> out his <hi>Conſcience</hi> into different depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The ſtructure, it appeared, went on, whilſt Mr.
Haſtings was content with overſeeing and cheering his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers.
—"Mr. Shore, ſaid he, you will take care to make
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0301701200:8"/>
me appear a good <hi>Financier</hi>! Major Scott, my <hi>Judgment</hi> is
repoſed in your hands! Mr. <hi>Middleton,</hi> my HUMANITY is
your's!!!—The work being thus done, Mr. Haſtings ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
it with a careleſs glance, and adopted it as his own.
But now that its defects appear, the Child of his Adoption
becomes the object of his averſion, his approbation ceaſes,
and his language is totally changed.—The Defence is, in
general, made up of general denials of the Charges, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
with encomiums on his own conduct; yet Mr. Haſtings
exclaims, "Subject me to all the other evidence againſt me;
—I know I can truſt to their want of Recollection, and their
force of Attachment.—Bare my boſom to every ſhaft of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
but ſave me from the <hi>Perils</hi> of my own <hi>Panegyric!</hi>"—
The <hi>haſte</hi> in which theſe productions were written, was alſo
alledged by Mr. Haſtings as an apology for every error; but
did it follow, that, becauſe a man wrote rapidly, he ſhould
alſo write falſely? or was it, that the truth and candour of
Mr. Haſtings were ſo deeply buried in his boſom, that long
ſtudy alone could bring them upwards, whilſt the natural
falſhood, floating on the ſurface, could be transferred with
extemporaneous readineſs to every topic, whether to be
written, or to be uttered?—Theſe were the apologies offered
for the variations, the admiſſions, and the inconſiſtency, of
Mr. Haſtings's Defences; but theſe, it was to be hoped, for
the ſake of propriety and good ſenſe, would never again be
repeated.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan, on quitting this ſubject, entered into a very
full and happy delineation of the ſituation of the Princeſſes
of <hi>Oude.</hi> No peruſal of the Turkiſh Hiſtory, he obſerved,
nor attention to the precepts of the Mahometan religion, could
give their Lordſhips any idea of the manners of the women
of high <hi>caſts</hi> in Hindoſtan. Educated in a profound reſpect
to the cuſtoms of their Perſian anceſtors, they maintained a
purer ſtyle of Prejudice, and a loftier degree of Superſtition;
dwelling perpetually within the precincts of their Zenanas,
the Simplicity of their ſentiments was equalled only by the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0301701200:9"/>
Purity of their conduct. In thoſe innocent retreats, they
were circumſcribed, not immured; for ſuch was the force of
Prejudice, that Liberty would be looked on as a curſe to
thoſe, to whom the common gaze of men would be regarded
as an unexpiable violation. However miſtaken their ideas,
they were placed there by the hand of Piety, and could not
be diſturbed but by a ſacrilege. They were as Relics on an
altar, which, though depoſited by Superſtition, none but the
impious would diſturb.</p>
            <p>In addition to thoſe claims, Mr. Haſtings himſelf had
borne teſtimony to the Duty which Children owed to Parents
in Hindoſtan: yet the Bhow Begum, or mother of the
reigning Nabob, had ſtill ſtronger demands on the affection
of her ſon.—In the year 1764, when <hi>Sujah Dowlah,</hi> after
the battle of Buxar, was driven from that territory by the
Engliſh—which their politic Generoſity afterwards reſtored—
ſhe bore her private treaſures to his aſſiſtance, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by the reſpectful attachment of his future life, with
the deviſe of all his territories to her ſon. she had alſo
interfered in a quarrel between her ſon and her huſband,
and, when the ſavage father was about to ſtrike down his
ſon with a ſabre, at the expence of her blood, preſerved
that life which ſhe gave.—Theſe were pleas in her favor,
which would have exacted the reverence of any man—<hi>but
one!</hi> But theſe pleas, the ſex, the age, and character of
the Begums; and what was yet more, the death-bed recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of Sujah Dowlah, were all of no weight with
Mr. Haſtings. This was therefore the object of the preſent
charge;—that where he owed protection, he had been the
ſevereſt oppreſſor; that the weakneſs which ſhould have
claimed his aid, but excited his violence; that he had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
the ſon thus, to make him the ungracious inſtrument
of his tyranny over the parent, and had firſt made him a <hi>ſlave,</hi>
in order that he might become—a <hi>monſter!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The interference of Mr. <hi>Briſtow</hi> in 1775, in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between the Begums and the Nabob, in conſequence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0301701200:10"/>
of the claims of the latter, was the next ground of Mr.
SHERIDAN'S obſervations.—Mr. Briſtow had then, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with the ſuperior or elder Begum, thrown out an
inſinuation, that the treaſures which ſhe poſſeſſed were the
treaſures of the State,—and on this inſinuation, ſo termed
by Mr. Briſtow himſelf, had Mr. Haſtings founded all his
arguments on that head, and on which he lately appeared to
place ſo much reliance.—The Begums at that time gave up
to the <hi>Aſoph ul Dowla</hi> ſums amounting to five hundred and
fifty thouſand pounds.—Of this a part was to be paid in
goods, which as they conſiſted of arms, elephants, &amp;c. the
Nabob alledged to be his property, and refuſed to accept as
payment. This occaſioned a diſpute which was referred to
the Board of <hi>Calcutta.</hi> Mr. Haſtings then vindicated the
right of the Begums to all the goods in the Zenana, and
brought over the majority of the Council to his opinion.
The ideas then placed on record, he had ſince found it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to diſown, as belonging not to him, but to the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Council!—How theſe opinions could be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
it might be difficult for their Lordſhips, though well
informed of the effects of <hi>Majorities</hi> and <hi>Minorities,</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
As well might Mr. BURKE, on a future day deliver
an encomium on that <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> man, Mr. <hi>Haſtings!</hi> and
if reminded of his ſhare in the proſecution, alledge, that he
was not accountable for ſo <hi>nefarious</hi> a proceeding; that his
opinions when once delivered, were no longer his own; that
at the time, he had conſtantly acted in a <hi>Minority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The claims, however, it was obſervable, of the Nabob,
as to the treaſure of the Begums, were at this time the only
plea alledged for the ſeizure. Theſe were always founded
on a paſſage of that <hi>Koran</hi> which was perpetually quoted,
but never proved.—Not a word was then mentioned of the
ſtrange rebellion which was afterwards conjured up, and of
which the <hi>exiſtence</hi> and the <hi>notoriety</hi> were equally a ſecret.—
A diſaffection which was at its height, at the very time when
the Begums were diſpenſing their liberality to the Nabob,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0301701200:11"/>
and exerciſing the greateſt generoſity to the Engliſh Officers
in diſtreſs!—a diſturbance, in ſhort, without its parallel in
hiſtory, which was raiſed by two <hi>Women,</hi>—carried on by two
<hi>Eunuchs,</hi>—and finally ſuppreſſed by an <hi>Affidavit!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan then adverted to the negociations of Mr.
Middleton with the Begums in 1778, when the diſcontents
of the ſuperior Begum would have induced her to leave the
country, unleſs her authority was ſanctioned, and her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
ſecured by the Guarantee of the Company.—This
Guarantee, the Council, or Mr. Haſtings, had thought it
neceſſary to deny, as knowing that if the agreements with
the Elder Begum were proved, it would affix to Mr. Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
the guilt of all the ſufferings of the Women of the
Khord Mahal, the revenues for whoſe ſupport were ſecured
by the ſame engagement. In treating this part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the principal difficulty aroſe from the <hi>uncertain</hi> evidence
of Mr. Middleton, who though concerned in the negociation
of <hi>four</hi> treaties, could not recollect affixing his ſignature
to <hi>three</hi> out of that number. Mr. Sheridan proved, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
from the evidence even of Mr. Middleton, that a
Treaty had been ſigned in October, 1778, wherein the rights
of the Elder Begum were fully recognized; a proviſion
ſecured for the Women and Children of the late Vizier in
the Khord Mahal; and that thoſe engagements had received
the fulleſt ſanction of Mr. Haſtings. Theſe facts were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the evidence of Mr. Purling, a gentleman, who,
Mr. Sheridan ſaid, had delivered himſelf fairly, and as
having no <hi>foul ſecrets</hi> to conceal. He had tranſmitted copies
of theſe engagements in 1780 to Mr. Haſtings at Calcutta;
the anſwer returned was, that in arranging the taxes on the
other diſtricts, he ſhould paſs over the Jaghires of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums.
No notice was then taken of any impropriety in the
tranſactions in 1778, nor any notice given of an intended
revocation of thoſe engagements.</p>
            <p>But in June 1781, when General Clavering, and Colonel
Monſon, being no more, and Mr. Francis having returned
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0301701200:12"/>
to Europe, all the <hi>hoard</hi> and <hi>arrear</hi> of collected evil burſt
forth without reſtraint, and Mr. Haſtings determined on his
Journey to the Upper Provinces;—it was then that, without
adverting to intermediate tranſactions, he met with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bob
Aſoph ul Dowlah, at Chunar, and received from him
the myſterious preſent of 100,000l.—To form a proper idea
of this tranſaction, it was only neceſſary to conſider the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
ſituation of him who gave, and him who received,
this preſent.—It was not given by the Nabob from the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
of his wealth, nor in the abundance of his eſteem for
the man to whom it was given: it was, on the contrary, a
prodigal bounty, drawn from a country depopulated,—no
matter whether by natural cauſes, or by the grinding of
Oppreſſion. It was raiſed by an exaction, which took what
Calamity had ſpared, and Rapine overlooked;—and purſued
thoſe angry diſpenſations of Providence, when a <hi>prophetic</hi>
chaſtiſement had been inflicted on a <hi>fated</hi> realm.—The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy
which had marked this tranſaction, was not the ſmalleſt
proof of its criminality. When <hi>Benaram Pundit</hi> had, a
ſhort time before, made a preſent to the Company of a lack
of rupees, Mr. Haſtings, in his own language, deemed it
"worthy the praiſe of being recorded." But in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
when ten times that ſum was given, neither Mr.
Middleton nor the Council were acquainted with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
until Mr. Haſtings, four months after, felt himſelf
compelled to write an account to England, and the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
returned thus circuitouſly to his friends in India!—It
was peculiarly obſervable in this tranſaction, how much the
<hi>Diſtreſſes</hi> of the different parties were at variance. Mr.
Haſtings travels to the Nabob, to ſee, no doubt, and enquire
into his <hi>Diſtreſſes,</hi> but immediately takes from him 130,000l.
to be applied to the neceſſities of the <hi>diſtreſſed</hi> Eaſt-India
Company. But, on farther deliberation, theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vaniſh: a <hi>third</hi> object ariſes, more worthy than either
of the former, and the money is taken from the one, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0301701200:13"/>
demanded from the other, to be applied to the uſe of—the
<hi>diſtreſſed</hi> Mr. Haſtings.</p>
            <p>The money, it was alledged by Mr. Haſtings, had been
originally taken to diſcharge the Arrear of the Army. It
had not been applied to that uſe, becauſe it was received in
bills on Gopal Dos, a rich Banker, of Benares, who was
then kept a priſoner by Cheit Sing.—Major Scott being
queſtioned on the ſubject, declared, that bills on Gopal Dos
were as good as caſh; for that, though the principal of the
houſe was a priſoner, that circumſtance made no difference
whatſoever with the other partners. Thus Mr. Haſtings was
inconſiſtent with himſelf, by alledging an objection which
ſhould have prevented his taking the money, in the firſt
inſtance, for the purpoſe he had ſtated; and Major Scott
contradicting Mr. Haſtings, removed the objection, and
reſtored the buſineſs to its original footing.—But, through
all thoſe windings of myſterious Hypocriſy, and of artificial
Concealment, it was eaſy to mark the ſenſe of hidden Guilt.
Mr. Haſtings himſelf, being driven from every other hold,
advanced the ſtale plea of <hi>State Neceſſity:</hi> but of this neceſſity
he had brought no proof; it was a neceſſity which liſtened to
whiſpers, for the purpoſe of crimination, and dealt in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to prove its own exiſtence.—To a General leading the
armies of Britain; to an Admiral bearing her thunders over
the ſeas,—the plea of Neceſſity might be indulged, if the
wants of thoſe were to be ſupplied whoſe blood had been
ſpilt in the ſervice of their country; but then, like the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
eagle deſcending from its neſt, though it deſolated
the ſkirts of the rock, the Motive and the Conduct would be
equally conſpicuous. No concealment would then be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
and they would diſdain the veil which covered the dark
mean arts of buſy Peculation.</p>
            <p>On the buſineſs of the Treaty of Chunar, which ſucceeded
the acceptance of this bribe, Mr. Sheridan was equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
and equally ſevere. It was a proceeding, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0301701200:14"/>
which, as it had its beginning in Corruption, had
its continuance in Fraud, and its end in Violence. The firſt
propoſition of the Nabob after his recent liberality, was,
that the army ſhould be removed, and all the Engliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
from his dominions. The Bribe which he had given
was the obvious price of their removal. He felt the weight
of their oppreſſion—he knew, to ſpeak his own language,
"that, when the Engliſh ſtaid, they ſtaid to aſk for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing."
Though their predeceſſors had exhauſted the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
—though they had ſhaken the tree until nothing remained
upon its <hi>leafleſs</hi> branches, yet a new flight was on the wing
to watch the firſt <hi>buddings</hi> of its proſperity, and to nip every
promiſe of future luxuriance.</p>
            <p>To this demand Mr. Haſtings had promiſed to accede,
and to recal every Engliſhman from the province; but by an
evaſion, which Mr. Middleton diſcloſed with ſo much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to their Lordſhips, on the laſt day of his appearance,
the promiſe was virtually recalled. No <hi>orders</hi> were afterwards
given for the eſtabliſhment of Engliſhmen in the province,
but <hi>recommendations</hi> of the ſame effect, with Mr. Middleton
and the Vizier, were ſent, and the practice continued.—In
the agreement reſpecting the Refumption of the Jaghires,
the Nabob had been duped by a ſimilar deception. He had
demanded and obtained leave to reſume thoſe of certain indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals:
Mr. Haſtings, however, defeated the permiſſion,
by making the order general; knowing that there were ſome
favourites of the Nabob whom he could be by no means
brought to diſpoſſeſs.—Such was the conduct of Mr. Haſtings,
not in the moment of cold or crafty policy, but in the hour
of confidence, and the efferveſcence of his gratitude for the
favour he had juſt received. Soaring above every common
feeling, he could deceive the man to whoſe liberality he
ſtood indebted—even his <hi>Gratitude</hi> was <hi>perilous</hi>—and a <hi>danger</hi>
actually awaited on the return which he was to make to an
effuſion of generoſity!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0301701200:15"/>
The tranſactions in which Sir <hi>Elijah Impey</hi> bore a ſhare,
and the tenor of his evidence, were the next objects of Mr.
Sheridan's animadverſion.—The late Chief Juſtice of Bengal,
he remarked, had repeatedly ſtated, that Mr. Haſtings left
Calcutta with <hi>two</hi> Reſources in his view,—thoſe of <hi>Benares</hi>
and of <hi>Oude.</hi> It appeared, however, from every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
that the latter reſource was never in his contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
until the inſurrections in Benar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>, terminating in the
capture of Bedjeygur, had deſtroyed all his hopes in that
province. At that inſtant the min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of Mr. Haſtings, fertile
in reſources, fixed itſelf on the Treaſures of the Begums,
and Sir Elijah Impey was diſpatched to collect materials for
their crimination. "But I have ever thought," ſaid Mr.
Sheridan, "the ſelection of ſuch a perſonage, for ſuch a
purpoſe, one of the greateſt aggravations of the guilt of
Mr. Haſtings."—That he, the purity of whoſe character
ſhould have influenced his conduct, even in his moſt domeſtic
retirements; that he, who, if conſulting the dignity of
Britiſh Juſtice, ſhould have remained as ſtationary as his
Court in Calcutta;—that ſuch a man ſhould be called to
travel <hi>Five Hundred</hi> miles, for the tranſaction of ſuch a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
was a deviation without a plea, and a degradation
without example.—This, however, was in ſome degree a
queſtion to be abſtracted for the conſideration of thoſe who
adorned and illumined the ſeats of Juſtice in Britain, and
the purity of whoſe character precluded the neceſſity of any
further obſervations on ſo different a conduct.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the manner in which Sir Elijah Impey
had delivered his evidence, it required ſome obſervation,
though made without imputing to that gentleman the ſmalleſt
culpability. Sir Elijah had admitted, that in giving his
evidence he had never anſwered without looking equally to
the probability, and the conſequences of the fact in queſtion.
Sometimes he had even admitted circumſtances of which he
had no recollection beyond the mere probability that they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0301701200:16"/>
had taken place. By conſulting in this manner what was
<hi>probable,</hi> and the contrary, he might certainly have corrected
his memory at times, and Mr. Sheridan ſaid he would
accept that mode of giving his teſtimony, provided that the
inverſe of the propoſition might alſo have place, and that
where a circumſtance was <hi>improbable,</hi> a ſimilar degree of
credit might be ſubtracted from the teſtimony of the witneſs.
<hi>Five</hi> times in the Houſe of Commons, and <hi>twice</hi> in that
Court, for inſtance, had Sir Elijah Impey borne teſtimony,
that a rebellion was raging at Fyzabad, at the time of his
journey to Lucknow. Yet on the <hi>eighth</hi> examination, he
had contradicted all the former, and declared, that what he
meant was that the rebellion <hi>had</hi> been raging, and the
country was then in ſome degree reſtored to quiet.—The
reaſons aſſigned for the former errors were, that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
a letter received from Mr. Haſtings, informing him
that the rebellion was quelled, and that he had alſo forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his own propoſition of travelling through Fyzabad to
Lucknow. With reſpect to the letter, nothing could be
ſaid, as it was not in evidence; but the other obſervation
would ſcarcely be admitted, when it was recollected that in
the Houſe of Commons Sir Elijah Impey had declared that
it was his propoſal to travel through Fyzabad, which had
originally brought forth the information that the way was
obſtructed by the rebellion!—From this information Sir
Elijah Impey had gone by the way of Illyabad,—but what
was yet more ſingular, was, that on his return he would
again have returned by the way of Fyzabad, if he had not
been again informed of the danger;—ſo that had it not been
for theſe friendly informations, the Chief Juſtice would have
run plump into the very <hi>focus</hi> of the rebellion!—There were
two circumſtances, however, worthy of remark;—the <hi>firſt</hi>
was, that Sir <hi>Elijah Impey</hi> ſhould, when charged with ſo
dangerous a commiſſion as that of procuring evidence, to
prove that the <hi>Begums</hi> had meditated the expulſion of their
ſon from the Throne, and of the Engliſh from Bengal,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0301701200:17"/>
ſhould twice intend to paſs through the city of their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc;
and that he, as he alledged, from mere motives of
ſchoolboy corioſity, ſhould chooſe the <hi>primroſe</hi> path—and
with, when engaged in ſuch a buſineſs, to loiter in the way,
and idle in the ſun-ſhine.—The ſecond circumſtance worthy
of obſervation, was, that if a concluſion could be made
from a cloud of circumſtances, the inference on this occaſion
would undoubtedly be, that Sir Elijah Impey was diſſuaded
by Mr. Haſtings, and Mr. Middleton from paſſing by the
way of Fyzabad, as well knowing, that if, as a friend to
Mr. Haſtings, he were to approach the Begums, he would
be convinced by his reception, that nothing could be more
foreign from the truth than the idea of their ſuppoſed diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
—It was alſo obſervable, that Sir Elijah Impey, at
Lucknow, taking evidence in the face of day in ſupport of
this charge of rebellion againſt the Begums, when converſing
with the Nabob and his Miniſter, heard not a ſingle word
from either of a rebellion, by which it was propoſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
the Nabob, and to change the Government of his
dominions!—And equally unaccountable it appeared that
Sir Elijah Impey, who had adviſed the taking of thoſe affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davits
for the ſafety of Mr. Haſtings, had never read them
at the time, for the purpoſe of ſeeing whether they were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for the purpoſe, or the contrary!—After ſo long a
reſerve, however, and after declaring on oath that he thought
it unneceſſary, the next ſtep taken by Sir Elijah Impey, was
to read the affidavits, as, however late, they might contribute
ſomething to his information. He had been led to this
ſtudy by his own allegation, from having been miſted by
Mr. SHERIDAN, one of the managers on the part of the
Commons, who by looking at a book which he held in his
hand, had perſuaded him to declare that a ſworn interpreter
was preſent on the receiving of thoſe-affidavits; that Major
Davy was preſent for that purpoſe—and that whoever it was,
he was perfectly ſatisfied with his conduct on the occaſion;
when it was actually in evidence that no interpreter whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0301701200:18"/>
was preſent.—Now, ſaid Mr. Sheridan, how I, by
merely looking into a book, could <hi>intimate</hi> the preſence of
an interpreter, could <hi>inculcate</hi> the aſſiſtance of Major Davy,
and could alſo <hi>look</hi> the ſatisfaction conceived by Sir Elijah
Impey, are queſtions which I believe that Gentleman alone
is able to determine!</p>
            <p>He ſhould admit, however, he ſaid, that Sir Elijah Impey
had not ſtrictly attended to forms on the occaſion of taking
thoſe affidavits; that he had merely directed the bible to be
given to the Whites, and the Koran to the Blacks, and had
packed up in his wallet the returns of both without any
further enquiry; or that he had glanced over them in India,
having previouſly cut off all communication between his <hi>eye</hi>
and his <hi>mind,</hi> ſo that no conſciouſneſs was transferred from
the former to the latter; and that he had read them in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
if poſſible, with leſs information:—however ſtrange
theſe circumſtances might be, he would admit them all;—
he would even admit, that the affidavits were legally and
properly taken—and yet would prove that thoſe affidavits
were not ſufficient to ſuſtain any one point of criminality
againſt thoſe who were the ſubjects of the preſent Charge.</p>

            <p>MR. SHERIDAN then reſumed his ſpeech, where he
had left off on Tueſday laſt, with a ſhort preface
to the following effect:</p>
            <p>In obedience to the commands of the Honourable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers,
he ſaid, he roſe to continue the obſervations which
he had to make, in ſumming up the evidence on the ſecond
Charge againſt Warren Haſtings, Eſq.—In doing this, he
truſted it would be believed that he had been, and would
continue to be, moſt guarded in quoting the evidence on
which he might have to animadvert, correctly and accurately,
and that for this purpoſe he had left off where he did, a part
of what he wiſhed to obſerve on not being in the way. He
left off at the affidavits, and here it was that he meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
his ſpeech: he conſidered their Lordſhips as in fact
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0301701200:20"/>
employ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in trying the truth of the matter of thoſe affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits,
and the allegations therein contained, upon which he
would have no objection to reſt the whole truth of the charge
brought againſt the priſoner. It was in this view, and for
this purpoſe, that he wiſhed to take up ſome part of their
Lordſhips time; but, before he entered into the diſcuſſion of
the affidavits, there were two or three matters on which he
was deſirous of ſaying a few words. In the outſet of this
buſineſs, it had been held forth as an allegation on the part
of the priſoner at the bar, and as an excuſe of the atrocious
proceeding againſt the Begums, that they had been guilty
of various acts of hoſtility, as well as of a wiſh to dethrone
the Nabob; and it was aſſorted that the affidavits taken at
Lucknow all tended to prove theſe facts. Of the firſt of
theſe two allegations, he challenged the Counſel for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
to produce a ſingle inſtance drawn from thoſe affidavits.
There was not a ſingle inſtance,—nay, the allegation was
even abandoned by themſelves;—a pretty ſtrong proof that
it had been taken up lightly. When a charge conſiſted of
two parts, and one of them was abandoned, it was very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
for a man to diſtruſt the other. It certainly was not a
proof that the other was falſe alſo, nor did he mean to aſſume
any ſuch argument; he ſaid only, that it would influence the
mind ſo far as to make it curious and particular in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
and to make it at leaſt diſtruſt the truth of the other
branch of the charge alſo. But their Lordſhips, in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
caſe, would have additional reaſon for jealouſy and
diſtruſt: they would recollect from whom theſe aſſertions and
charges againſt the Begums came, and by whom they were
made: they were made by Mr. Haſtings, who went forth
from Calcutta in the year 1781, for the avowed purpoſe of
collecting a large ſum of money, and who acknowledged
that he had but two reſources. Here then we had, in the
ſame perſon, the accuſer and the judge—nay more, we had
a judge corruptly intereſted in the accuſation he was to
make, and who intended to draw a profit, and reap an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0301701200:21"/>
from deciding on the accuſation which he himſelf
made. He would not take up their Lordſhips time, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inga
word on the groſs turpitude of ſuch a double character,
nor on the frontleſs diſregard of all the feelings which ought
to actuate the human heart, in thus mixing characters that
ought never to be joined. What did he deſire from all this?
Only that an accuſation, made under ſuch circumſtances,
ſhould not meet with implicit belief, and that their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
remembering that it was ſo made, would accompany
him through the diſcuſſion of the affidavits, free and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
by thoſe prefatory and general aſſertions.</p>
            <p>The next matter that he was anxious to proſs on their
conſideration, previous to his taking up the affidavits, was
the infinite improbability of ſuch an intention being true,
from the utter impoſſibility of executing the deſign. Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
the power of the Begums at the moſt ſanguine ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
it could not evidently be in their reach to accompliſh
any overthrow, deciſive or momentary, of the Nabob, much
leſs of the Engliſh. He was not, however, ſo weak as to
aſſert a doctrine, that becauſe a thing was improbable, it
was not therefore attempted; or that, becauſe they had no
intereſt in the accompliſhment of the object, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did not undertake it. He could not look to Mr.
Haſtings without knowing, and being forced to acknowledge,
that there were people with ſuch a perverſe turn of mind as
to proſecute miſchief without intereſt; and that there were
paſſions in the human ſoul, which lead to turpitude without
a motive.</p>
            <p>He now came to the conſideration of the affidavits—that
maſs of legal evidence on which the priſoner meant to reſt
his defence, and which he conſidered of ſo much conſequence
to his acquittal on this charge. He had ſaid, that when the
Honourable Mover of the Impeachment came to this charge,
he treated the affidavits in his peculiar manner, and loaded
them with terms of opprobrious reproach. What the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner of his Honourable Friend was, as hinted in this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0301701200:22"/>
manner, he could not tell; but he, for his own part, would
ſay, that if they were treated otherways than with diſdain,
they had not their deſert. It was aſſerted, that they were
taken in the deſire of procuring the beſt poſſible evidence of
the ſtate of the country, and of the circumſtances of the
inſurrection. This was a direct falſhood;—they were taken
for no other purpoſe but that of juſtifying Mr. Haſtings in
his plunder of the Begums; that no other intention was in
the minds of any of the perſons concerned, and that the
deſign was not formed, until, by the failure of one of his
reſources, this only remained for the plunderer.</p>
            <p>He left off with the crippled teſtimony of his friend Dewen
Sing. Here then he began, and he entered into a minute
diſcuſſion of all the affidavits, reading, comparing, and
commenting on the paſſages. To enumerate all theſe would
require much ſpace; nor, unleſs the reader was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with all the facts, would it be poſſible for us to
make him taſte and feel the ſtrength of Mr. Sheridan's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
which was as cloſe, connected, and convincing, as
any ſpeech we ever heard on any occaſion. He particularly
animadverted on the affidavits of Hyder Beg Cawn, who,
though the Miniſter of the Nabob, and the man of all others
the beſt acquainted with the tranſactions then paſſing in the
country, did not ſay one ſyllable on the ſubject of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
rebellion, nor hint any thing of the kind; and this,
though the affidavit was made in November, 1781, and the
rebellion was pretended to have been at leaſt previous to that
time:—on that of Mr. Middleton, which alſo was taken on
the 27th of November, and that after he knew the pleaſure
of Mr. Haſtings as to the plunder of the Begums. The
only paſſage which his affidavit contained reſpecting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
was, that he had heard from rumour that they
had given much encouragement, and ſome aid, to the Jag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiredars,
in reſiſting the reſumption; and that he heard
there had been a good diſpoſition in them towards the Rajah
Cheit Sing. The whole of his evidence went on mere hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0301701200:23"/>
and rumour, and it amounted to much encouragemet
and ſome aid—on which circumſtance it was that he made
up his conſcience to the plunder, and probably to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the ladies. He knew nothing of it himſelf,
though he was the Reſident. He ſaw no inſurrection; he
met with no indiſpoſitions; he knew nothing of it himſelf,
but he had heard that they had encouraged the Jaghiredars
to reſiſt, and on this, and no more, was this conſcientious
ſervant of Mr. Haſtings ready to execute any ſcheme of
plunder that he ſhould deviſe.—The Hon. Manager alſo
particularly adverted to the affidavit of Major M 'Donald, of
Captain Gordon, and of a Frenchman, whoſe depoſition was
quite in the French ſtyle, magnificent and glittering: it
talked of his having penetrated the deſarts—of his having
ſeen tygers—of his having kept the beſt company—and
heard a vaſt number of important rumours, but not one
word about the rebellion of the Begums.—He went through
the affidavits of Colonel Hannay, and, among others, to
that ſtating that three Zemindars, on the 31ſt of December,
had ſaid, that they were credibly informed that there was a
deſign in the Begums againſt the Nabob. But theſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
Serjeants would not ſuffer their names to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
all the reward that they expected was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
—although they were thus rendering ſervice to their
Sovereign, and that that Sovereign was now in entire poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of power, and free from all poſſible effects of any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
hoſtility from the quarter alledged to have deſigns.</p>
            <p>Having ſtated the contents of the ſeveral affidavits, he
ſaid, he knew that in a Court of Law, if the trial were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
merely on the truth and validity of theſe affidavits,
he ſhould be ſtopt, if he attempted to begin any anſwer to,
and obſervation upon them. He ſhould be told from the
Bench—What do you mean to anſwer? There is nothing
contained in theſe affidavits upon which we can ſuffer you to
take up the time of the Court one minute. There is not,
from the beginning to the end, one particle of legal, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0301701200:24"/>
or even a defenſible proof. Nothing but hearſay
and rumour. Such he knew would be the admonition
which he ſhould receive in any Court of Law; but meaning
and wiſhing to meet every thing at their Lordſhip's bar, on
which the priſoner could build the ſmalleſt degree of depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
it was his wiſh to examine ſeparately the points which
it was the aim of the priſoner to ſet up by theſe affidavits.
They were three in number, and he ſhould treat of each
ſingly.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the Begums gave aſſiſtance to the Rajah Cheyt
Sing.</item>
               <item>2. That they encouraged and aſſiſted the Jaghiredars to
reſiſt the reſumptions of the Jaghires.</item>
               <item>And, 3. That they were the principal movers of all the
commotions in Oude.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe were the three allegations, which it was meant to
inſinuate theſe affidavits contained—and all theſe were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a general charge, that the Begums were in
rebellion. He declared, that in regard to the laſt inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he had ſearched with all the indefatigable induſtry of
an antiquary, hunting for a precious veſtige that was to
decide ſome important point in hiſtory, for this rebellion.—
But of this rebellion, which in the mouth of Mr. Haſtings
was ſpoken of with as much certainty as that of 1745 was
mentioned in England, no trace nor appearance could he
find.—He could neither find the place where it raged, nor
time when. No battle had been fought—no army had
marched—no blood had been ſpilt—not one ſingle thing had
happened, by which any one creature in the country where
it was ſaid to happen could poſſibly have diſcovered that a
rebellion was there. It was a rebellion that never ſtruck a
blow, and that never was ſtruck.—It was a rebellion, the
object of which was unnatural, but which died a natural
death. If rebellions of ſuch a kind could be, there was no
ſaying where a rebellion might not exiſt. Perhaps, at the
very moment that he was ſpeaking, there might be a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0301701200:25"/>
raging in the heart of London. Perhaps it might be at
this moment lying perdue in ſome of the adjacent villages;
or like the oſtentatious encampment that had given celebrity
to Brentford and Ealing, it might have taken up its head
quarters at Hammerſmith, or Iſtington, ready to pour down
its violence on the approach of night. He was very eager
to aſcertain the time of this horrid rebellion. There was
nothing ſo clear and manifeſt as this fact—that there was
none in the beginning of Auguſt 1781. On the 29th of
that month there were confidential letters from Col. Morgan
the commanding officer, and there was not one ſyllable in
theſe letters of any ſuch thing. He afterwards detache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> troops
from Cawn Poote; and on the 27th of September he
gives an account of ſome inſurrection at Lucknow; but of
none at Fyzabad, nor of any thing like it. There was a
letter from Major Hannay, then at the Rajah's Court, dated
the 10th of September, in which there is an account of the
ſtate of the Rajah's affairs; but not one ſyllable of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of his being aſſiſted by the Begums. There was after
this a letter from the ſame Court, communicating the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fources
of the Rajah. In this letter he was adviſed to apply
to the Nabob himſelf, from whom there was a probability of
his receiving ſuccour; but not to apply to Hyder Beg, who
was ſtated to be intereſt of the Engliſh. During all
this time, therefore, there was no rebellion. The Nabob
went to ſee his mother, the very lady who was ſaid to have
riſen in rebellion againſt him. But Mr. Middleton ſtated,
that he was accompanied by 2000 horſe, having no martial
memory on common occaſions. Mr. Middleton could exactly
tell that theſe troops kept pace with the Nabob, who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
very faſt, ſo much ſo that he could hardly keep up
with him; but the Nabob having, according to Mr. Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton,
taken 2000 horſe with him, he obſerved the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
ſeized on the 2000 horſe, and certainly meant to aſſert
that theſe 2000 horſe were taken for no other purpoſe than
to quell the inſurrection; unfortunately, however, for the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0301701200:26"/>
martial memory of Mr. Middleton, Captain Edwards, who
was rather more of a military man, and whoſe duty it was to
accompany the Nabob, ſtated that he had but five or ſix
hundred horſe, and thoſe ſo miſerably equipped, and ſo bad
that they were not able to keep up with him, and but a few
indeed were near his perſon, or within the reach of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
ſo as to be applied to any ſervice; for of theſe few,
the moſt were diſaffected and mutinous from being ill paid;
ſo that the horſe that he had with him were rather diſpoſed
to aſſiſt than to quell any inſurrections. Still more unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
the memory of Mr. Middleton had unexpectedly
cleared up, and informed the Court that it was a conſtant
thing for the Princes of India to travel with a great equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
and that it was conſidered as a diſreſpect to the perſon
whom they viſited, to come unattended. But the Counſel
ſhould have the whole of the horſe, camels, elephants, and
all, and they ſhould all gallop as faſt as they might pleaſe to
wiſh.—What did they mean, or wiſh to eſtabliſh from this
fact? It never was their intention to inſinuate that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bob
went to pay his reſpects to his mother unattended by his
retinue. He could not mean to go <hi>incog.</hi> unleſs he wiſhed
to keep pace with the rebellion.—That hearing of a rebellion
of two old women without an army, he thought that it
ſhould be quelled by a Prince in diſguiſe, without his
guards. They did not mean to ſay that the Indian Princes
travelled like the Princes of Europe, who ſometimes from
one motive, and ſometimes from another—at times from
political views, and at times from curioſity—travelling ſome
to France to learn manners, others to England to learn
liberty—choſe to be relieved from the pomps of ſtate, and
from the drudgery of equipage.—It was not ſo in India—
where the manners required oſtentation, and where it would
be conſidered as an inſult for one Prince to viſit another
without maintaining his ſtate.</p>
            <p>He then, as he ſaid, would put to the route a thouſand
audges, who were ſaid to be diſpatched by the Begums, for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0301701200:27"/>
the purpoſe of promoting an inſurrection. He detected all
the contradictory accounts that had been given of theſe
matchlock-men, and having ſhewn the complete fallacy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to be impoſed on the credulity of the world in this
inſtance, he aſked why the younger ſon of the Bhow Begum
had not been ſuſpected of having any concern or intereſt in
this rebellion? This particularly had been very thoroughly
explained. Sir Elijah Impey had been aſked whether this
Prince had any wealth?—No, none—he was miſerably poor,
and was a penſioner—there was the ſolution of the difficulty.
There never was in the mind of Mr. Haſtings a ſuſpicion
of <hi>treaſon</hi> where there was not <hi>treaſure.</hi> Penury was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
and ſatisfactory proof that he could not be diſaffected—
opulence on the contrary was a manifeſt indication of diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.
Mr. Haſtings, in his political ſagacity, took the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
of the doctrine that the experience of hiſtory had
eſtabliſhed; that opulence and wealth, as they attached a
man to the country where they lay, made him cautious and
circumſpect how he hazarded any enterprize that might
draw on himſelf the jealouſy of Government. Poverty on
the other hand made a man giddy and deſperate; having no
permanent ſtake, he was eaſily ſeduced into commotion.
Mr. Haſtings, on the contrary, never failed to find a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
and ſelf-evident proof of attachment in penury, and
an unanſwerable evidence of rebellion in wealth.</p>
            <p>In enumerating the various ſtrong inſtances of the ſteady
friendſhip and good diſpoſition of the Begums to the Engliſh
intereſts, Mr. Sheridan particularly animadverted on the
repreſentation they had made in favour of Captain—,
whoſe life they had ſaved at the very moment when, if they
had meant to ſtrike any blow againſt the Engliſh intereſts,
the blow would have been felt.—This gentleman, whoſe
life the Bhow Begum had ſaved, and who in the firſt and
natural feelings of the ſoul, had repeatedly poured forth his
grateful acknowledgements of the obligation, had afterwards
been made the inſtrument of the deſtruction of his faviour.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0301701200:28"/>
It had been aſked why the Managers had not called Captain
—to the bar.—Why call him to the bar!—He never
hoped to ſee him at the bar till he came there with fervent
contrition and penitentiary zeal, to make atonement to the
Princeſs, who was to him his ſecond creator, and whom,
with the breath of life, the gift of the Begum, he had
accuſed; and in the preſence of their common God; had
ſolemnly poured forth a part of that breath in an affidavit,
by which her ruin was to be accompliſhed! He would not
believe it poſſible, that after having repeatedly acknowledged
that he owed his life and liberty to the beneficent hand of
this Lady, he could ſo far forget all that he owed, as of his
own mere motion to come forward and make this affidavit.
His knowledge of human feelings would not permit him to
believe that it could be poſſible for any human creature to be
guilty of an act ſo atrocious.—He muſt imagine that the
Gentleman had been deluded and impoſed upon—that he
had been falſely and ſcandalouſly deceived—and that at the
moment when he made that affidavit, he was ignorant of the
uſe to which it was to be applied.—He hoped, and truſted,
that ſeeing that he was made the inſtrument of the ruin, and
overthrow of his benefactreſs, he would come forward and
ſtate the impoſition that had been practiſed upon him—for
he could not be perſuaded that any human creature could be
capable of ſtanding up in the preſence of God, and exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
—To this woman I owe my life, and my gratitude ſhall
be her deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan continued in a ſtrain of eloquence more
lofty and commanding than any thing we ever heard, to
ſtate the circumſtance of the book, the leaves of which were
torn out, and which was mutilated for the purpoſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment.
After ſtating all the circumſtances of this fact,
and the manner in which the fact had been accounted for,
he called it a black perjury.—Then riſing in his eloquence
to a flight beyond our power to trace him, he ſaid, that
theſe letters, though thus torn and mangled, were brought
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0301701200:29"/>
light.—That power which gives to the arms of infant inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
the ſtrength of Hercules—which controuls the mighty,
and abaſhes the confident—which gives to truth perſuaſion
beyond the reach of eloquence—the look that appalls—the
ſupplicating tear that ſoftens—the tone tender, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
which at once foothes and convinces the ſoul—that
power, which in all the turns and windings of hypocritical
and impudent falſehood ever ranges on the ſide of ſimple and
unobtruding truth, leads the mind through all the mazes of
craft and wickedneſs, with which this myſterious villainy is
covered, and arouſing all the indignation of juſtice, points
its puniſhment, Heaven-directed, to the head of the deteſted
but unrepenting author.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan proceeded to ſhew in how many inſtances,
and at what critical times the ſincere friendſhip of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums
had diſtinguiſhed itſelf, and been exerted in our
favour. In that critical moment, when after the affair of
Captain Gordon, the intereſts of Mr. Haſtings were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own account, almoſt deſperate; during the
whole time, from the 22d of Auguſt to the 22d of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
when with a prodigality of truth he truly confeſſed that
the ſituation of himſelf and his ſmall party was deſperate;—
when the hoarded vengeance of Heaven was about to burſt,
and ſeemed to wait only for the completion of his guilt in
the attempt on Cheit Sing, to break on his head, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
him to ruin—what did they do? Inſtead of ſeizing
on the criſis to carry into effect any ſcheme they might have
engendered againſt him—inſtead of accompliſhing his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
which with their aid would at that moment have
been certain, theſe women, with a nobleneſs worthy of the
ſex, though ill applied as to the object, came forward to
ſhare in, not to contribute to his fall.</p>
            <p>So much as to the firſt head of charge againſt the Begums.
—The ſecond charge, that of their aſſiſting the Jaghiredars,
he ſhould ſay but little on. We learned in February 1782,
of the Begums having countenanced the reſiſtance.—True—
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0301701200:30"/>
And they now gave this preſumed countenance diſcovered in
February 1782, as a reaſon which operated to the ruin of
the Princeſſes in November 1781. He took notice alſo of
the curious circumſtance of Mr. Middleton's ſending back
the troops at the deſire of the Nabob; but ſtating that
having done ſo, the Nabob muſt pay an extraordinary price
in future, as theſe troops might be employed againſt his
own Aumeels.</p>
            <p>He now came to the third charge, ſaid to be eſtabliſhed
by thoſe affidavits.—That the Begums had been the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
movers of all the commotions in Oude; and here he
confeſſed he thought there was ſuch a body of damning evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as required only to be ſtated, and which would render
all elucidation unneceſſary. The commotions in Oude were
ſimply and ſolely to be attributed to the Engliſh gentlemen.
The Nabob's deſcription of their rapacity and violence was
itſelf a full extention of all that was now to be attributed to
the poor old women. He gave a very particular account of
their depredations. They had but one argument, conſiſting
of two words. They wanted all the money that could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be raiſed in the country, by violence, by extortion, by
rapine, or by ſtealth, but for two purpoſes, to pay the army,
and fee the adminiſtration of Juſtice. He ſtated the various
ſteps which had been taken by the Nabob, to deliver his
devoted country from their violence, and particularly from
the vulture graſp of Colonel Hannay, until at length, as
Major Naylor wrote, a gentleman, whoſe ſoul poſſeſſed the
qualities of his ſpecies, "the inhabitants, whoſe meek natures
no irritation had been theretofore able to provoke, were at
length goaded into tumult; and in their deſpair, that meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that yielding, and womaniſh ſoftneſs which charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized
every action, changed to a perſevering obſtinacy that
was not to be ſubdued."—So that on the banks of the Ganges
where the inſurrection happened, the routed would not fly,
the wounded would not ſuffer themſelves to be cured.—Here
again we had opened to us another vein of the richeſt and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0301701200:31"/>
pureſt eloquence, and which in daring to touch, we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
we ſhall debaſe.</p>
            <p>If, exclaims Mr. Sheridan, if a ſtranger had at this tim
(in 1782) gone into the kingdom of Oude, ignorant of what
had happened ſince the death of Sujah Dowla, that man
who with a ſavage heart had ſtill great lines of character,
and who with all his ferocity in war, had ſtill with a culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
hand preſerved to his country the riches which it
derived from benignant ſkies, and a prolific ſoil—if this
ſtranger, ignorant of all that had happened in the ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval,
and obſerving the wide and general devaſtation, and
all the horrors of the ſcene—of plains uncloathed and brown
—of vegetation burnt up and extinguiſhed—of villages depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated
and in ruin—of temples unroofed and periſhing—of
reſervoirs broken down and dry—he would naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
what war has thus laid waſte the fertile fields of this
once beautiful and opulent country—what civil diſſenſions
have happened thus to tear aſunder, and ſeparate the happy
ſocieties that once poſſeſſed thoſe villages—What diſputed
ſucceſſion—What religious rage has, with unholy violence,
demoliſhed thoſe temples, and diſturbed ſervent, but unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
piety, in the exerciſe of its duties—What mercileſs
enemy has thus ſpread the horrors of fire and ſword—What
ſevere viſitation of Providence has thus dried up the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and taken from the face of the earth every veſtige of
green?—Or rather, what monſters have ſtalked over the
country, tainting and poiſoning with peſtiferous breath,
what the voracious appetite could not devour?—To ſuch
queſtion, what muſt be the anſwer? No wars have ravaged
theſe lands and depopulated theſe villages—No civil diſcords
have been felt—No diſputed ſucceſſion—No religious rage—
No mercileſs enemy—No affliction of Providence, which,
while it ſcourged for the moment, cut off the ſources of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitation
—No voracious and poiſoning monſters—No—All
this has been accompliſhed by the <hi>friendſhip, generoſity,</hi> and
<hi>kindneſs</hi> of the Engliſh nation—They have embraced us with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0301701200:32"/>
their protecting arms—and, lo, theſe are the fruits of their
allian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>. What then, ſhall we be told, that under ſuch
circumſtances, the exaſperated feelings of a whole people,
thus goaded and ſpurred on to clamour and reſiſtance, were
excited by the poor and feeble influence of the Begums!
When we hear from Capt. Naylor the deſcription that he
gives of the paroxiſm, fever, and delirium, into which deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
had thrown the natives, when on the banks of the
polluted Ganges, panting for death, they tore more widely
open the lips of their gaping wounds, to accelerate their
diſſolution, and while their blood was iſſuing, preſented their
ghaſtly eyes to Heaven, breathing their laſt and fervent
prayer that the dry earth might not be ſuffered to drink their
blood, but that it might riſe up to the throne of God, and
rouſe the eternal Providence to avenge the wrongs of their
country. Will it be ſaid that all this was brought about by
the incantations of theſe Begums in their ſecluded Zenana?
or that they could inſpire this enthuſiaſm and this deſpair
into the breaſts of a people who felt no grievance, and had
ſuffered no torture? What motive then could have ſuch
influence in their boſoms? What motive! That which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the common parent, plants in the boſom of man, and
which, though it may be leſs active in the Indian than in
the Engliſhman, is ſtill congenial with, and makes a part of
his being.—That feeling which tells him, that man was
never made to be the property of man; but that when in
the pride and inſolence of power, one human creature dares
to tyrannize over another, it is a power uſurped, and reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is a duty.—That feeling which tells him that all
power is delegated for the good, not for the injury of the
people, and that when it is converted from the original pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
the compact is broken, and the power is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.
—That principle which tells him that reſiſtance to
power uſurped is not merely a duty which he owes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and to his neighbour, but a duty which he owes to his
God in aſſerting and maintaining the rank which he gave
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0301701200:33"/>
him in his creation!—To that common God, who, where
he gives the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> whatever may be the complexion,
gives alſo the <hi>feelings</hi> and the <hi>rights</hi> of <hi>man.</hi>—That principle,
which neither the rudeneſs of ignorance can ſtifle, nor the
enervation of reſinement extinguiſh!—That principle which
makes it baſe for a man to ſuffer when he ought to act;
which tending to preſerve to the ſpecies the original deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Providence, ſpurns at the arrogant diſtinctions of
man, and vindicates the independent quality of his race.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan, after this, proceeded to ſay, that he thought
an attentive peruſal of all the circumſtances, as he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to exhibit them to the view of their Lordſhips, would
ſatisfy them of the innocence of the Begums. But he was
ſenſible that the proof of their innocence carried with it no
concluſive proof of the guilt of the priſoner; and this was
the next object of his ſpeech. In a cloſe chain of argument,
he proved that the rebellion was not projected—was not even
in the imagination of Mr. Haſtings, until their ruin
had been determined; that the rebellion was an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought,
and was taken up as a means of juſtification, in
the conſciouſneſs that juſtification was neceſſary. To prove
this, he ſhewed, that he never wrote to the Council until
the month of February; that though he wrote letters to
Mr. Wheeler, and though, in his famous narrative, he called
the God of Truth to witneſs that he had made no conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he concealed every particle, both of the rebellion and
of the plunder, until he had been able to make up the body
of rant and craft, rhapſody and enigma, which he produced
under the title of "A Narrative of the Tranſactions." He
ſhewed, that his pretended reaſons for the concealment of
five months, were direct fallacies; and having taken pains
to elucidate theſe points, he ſaid, that it had been a practice
with Mr. Haſtings to hold himſelf out as a preternatural
being, gifted with good fortune, or elſe the peculiar favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of Heaven, and that Providence never failed to take up
and carry, by wiſe but hidden means, every project of his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0301701200:34"/>
to its deſtined end. In this blaſphemous way did the priſoner
at the bar libel the courſe of Providence. Thus, according
to him, when his corruptions and briberies were on the eve
of expoſure, Providence inſpired the heart of Nundcomar to
commit a low baſe crime, in order to ſave Mr. Haſtings from
ruin. Thus alſo, when in his attempts on Cheyt `Sing, and
his plunder of the Begums, Providence ſtepped in, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
the one with reſiſtance, and the other with rebellion,
to forward his purpoſes. Thus did he arrogantly hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
forth as a man, not only the favourite of Providence,
but as one for whoſe ſake Providence departed from the
eternal courſe of its own wiſe diſpenſations. Thus did he
preſume to ſay, that he was honoured and aſſiſted in the
adminiſtration of office by inſpired felonies, heaven born
armies, and providential treaſons! arraigning that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
whoſe works are goodneſs, and whoſe ways are
right.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed, through the whole of his defence upon this
charge, that Mr. Haſtings, ſenſible that truth would undo
him, thought that falſhood of any nature would ſerve his
turn. In this view he had drawn together a ſet of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
without conſiſtency, and without connection, not
knowing, or not remembering, that there is nothing which
requires ſo much care in the fabrication as a ſyſtem of lies.
The ſeries muſt be regular and unbroken; but his falſhoods
were eternally at variance, and demoliſhed one another.
Indeed, in all his conduct he ſeemed to be actuated but by
one principle—to do things contrary to the eſtabliſhed form.
This architecture militated againſt the firſt principles of the
art. He begun with the frieze and the capital, and laid the
baſe of the column at the top. Thus having his houſe
turned up-ſide down, he plumed himſelf on the novelty of
his idea, till it came trembling about his ears. His fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
was equal to his architecture. He raiſed a rampart
on a ſpot which the enemy might command: he meant to
ſurround himſelf with a foſſe, but left an opening for the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0301701200:35"/>
aſſailant. He built on a precipice, and encamped on a
mine.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it might be ſaid, that that guilt could not be
great, where the veil with which it was covered was ſo thin.
He was not of this opinion. His honourable and exalted
friend, who had opened generally to their Lordſhips the
articles of Impeachment, and whoſe name he never could
mention but with the reſpect and admiration due to his virtue
and his talents; whoſe proud diſdain of vice could only be
equalled by the ability with which he corrected it; whoſe
eloquence was not tranſitory, as happily there were portions
of it that would be felt and admired, when all of the aſſembly
then preſent would be mute, and moſt of them forgotten—
his honourable friend had ſaid, in opening the charges,
"that there was ſomething in the nature and conformation
of vice, which made it inconſiſtent with prudence." He
could not agree implicitly with his honourable friend in this
ſentiment. If the true definition of prudence were the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
management and conduct of a purpoſe to its ſucceſsful
end, he thought he could imagine to himſelf inſtances in
which this ſpecies of prudence might be diſcovered in minds
diſtinguiſhed by the atrocity of their acts. When he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the actions of a Philip of Macedon, of a Caeſar, of a
Cromwell, he could perceive great guilt ſucceſsfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to its end, if not by legitimate prudence, at leaſt by
conſummate craft. It was therefore his opinion, that the
doctrine of his honourable friend held true only in thoſe
minds which could not be ſatisfied with the indulgence of a
ſingle crime; where, inſtead of one baſe maſter-paſſion hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the complete ſway, to which all the faculties were ſubject,
and on which alone the mind was bent, there was a combuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and rivalry among a number of bad paſſions; where
pride, vanity, avarice, luſt of power, cruelty, and ſo forth,
all at once actuated the human ſoul, and diſtracted its func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
—all of them clamouring for deſtruction, and each in
it own barbarous jargon preferring its claim,—all diſſonant
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0301701200:36"/>
and tumultuous,—all of them ſtruggling for pre-eminence
and each counteracting the other. In ſuch a mind, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
great crimes could never be accompanied by prudence.
There was a fortunate diſability, occaſioned by the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that reſcued the human ſpecies from the villainy of the
intention. Such was the original denunciation of Nature.—
Not ſo was it with the pure paſſions: in the breaſt where
they reſided, the harmony was never interrupted by the
number; a perfect and ſubſtantial agreement gave an acceſſion
of vigour to each, and ſpreading their influence in every
direction, like the divine intelligence and benignity from
which they flowed, all of them filling their ſeveral ſpaces,
ſome in their larger, ſome in their more contracted orbits,
moving by ſweet conſent in their allotted place,—they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
true glory and happineſs to the individual by whom
they were poſſeſſed, and extended it to the community of
which he was a member.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan was then proceeding to ſhew, that the Nabob
had violated the covenant of Nature, in riſing up againſt
his mother; but that to this ſhameleſs outrage he was
driven by the tyranny of the priſoner, who, as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid, had made him a <hi>ſlave,</hi> to compel him to become
—a <hi>monſter!</hi>

            </head>
            <p>MR. SHERIDAN began without any other preface
than this, that relying on the indulgence with which
he had been hitherto ſo largely honored, he would reſume his
ſpeech, he ſaid, where he had ſtopped on the preceding day,
without taking up any of their Lordſhips time in preliminary
matter. He had left off with that part of the body of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which proved the abject ſtate of vaſſalage in which
the Nabob was held, and by which it was, in his opinion,
rendered manifeſt, that every act of his, particularly thoſe
ſtrong acts in which he violated every obligation of a ſon,
were done not merely at the inſtigation, but abſolutely at
the command of the priſoner. It would not be difficult to
prove, that if he had been independent he certainly would
not have committed thoſe acts, and this he ſhould be able to
demonſtrate to their Lordſhips. But firſt he begged leave to
ſay, that in the perpetration of thoſe ſhameful and atrocious
crimes which made the ſubject of the preſent charge, there
were three principal, and three ſubordinate actors. The
three principal, or rather the one great and leading princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
with his two chief coadjutors, were Mr. Haſtings,
Mr. Middleton, and Sir Elijah Impey.—The three ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
actors were Colonel Hannay, Hyder Beg Cawn, and
Ali Abram Cawn. Before he proceeded to ſhew that every
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0301701200:38"/>
one of the acts were forcibly impoſed on the Nabob, he
made ſome obſervations on part of the evidence of Sir Elijah
Impey. He had given as a reaſon for not having at any
time after he took the affidavits, converſed with Mr. Haſtings
on the ſubject to which they alluded, that he quitted Chunar
the next day, and that therefore he had not had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of ſeeing, in order to converſe with him on that or
any ſubject. Mr. Sheridan ſhewed, from letters written by
Sir Elijah and Mr. Haſtings, that they had quitted Chunar
in company, and had continued together for ſome time. Sir
Elijah had ſtated alſo, that he had delivered the affidavits
into the hands of Mr. Haſtings, and knew nothing of them
afterwards. Mr. Sheridan ſhewed that Major Davie had
received the Perſian affidavits from Sir Elijah to tranſlate on
the 12th of December, although Sir Elijah had ſaid that he
gave them to Mr. Haſtings previous to his quitting Chunar,
which was on the 1ſt of December. Mr. Sheridan ſaid, he
took notice of theſe facts juſt to ſhew the reſpect that was to
be paid to the teſtimony of Sir Elijah.</p>
            <p>With regard to the affidavits as a body of evidence, the
whole was mere hearſay and rumour. Captain Scott, who
by being in the country where the ſcene of the rebellion was
ſaid to lye, had had a good opportunity of knowing the
facts, was not examined, and the teſtimony of Hoolas Roy,
who of all others was the beſt informed on the ſubject, was
ſuppreſſed. That his affidavit was taken was manifeſt, and
he called on the priſoner to ſay where this affidavit was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
and why it was withheld. Mr. Sheridan ſaid, that
in the celebrated letter written by Mr. Haſtings, dated the
19th of December, his own knowledge of the tranſactions
was the moſt confuſed and contradictory that could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
He enumerated the various contradictions of that
letter.—He ſaid that Mr. Haſtings had made a number of
curious aſſertions in regard to the plunder of the treaſures,
and reſumption of the jaghires.—The propoſition was firſt
made to him, that the treaſures ſhould be taken as an alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0301701200:39"/>
for the jaghires, but in making that propoſition it
was ſaid, that they belonged of right to the Nabob.—Mr.
Haſtings took it in the firſt ſenſe, as he called it; that was,
he determined to ſeize on the treaſures, not as an alternative
for the jaghires, but to take them firſt becauſe the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made, and to take the jaghires afterwards. He
was very anxious to have it believed that the propoſition
came from the Nabob, although, by the whole tenor of Mr.
Middleton's letters, confidential as well as public, it was
demonſtrated with what difficulty they were able to extort
from him his conſent to the violence. Mr. Sheridan adverted
to the curious letter written by Mr. Haſtings to Mr. Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
and Mr. Johnſon, ſaying that the treaty made by him
with the Nabob at Chunar, from its favourable tendency,
had given riſe to ſuſpicions that money had been taken to
procure it, and calling on them to exculpate themſelves.—
Upon which they with great formality declared on their
honours, and before God, that they had neither received
any bribe, nor had an idea of any; which declaration,
made with ſo much ſolemnity, ſatisfied Mr. Haſtings, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a little perhaps from the conſciouſneſs that he had the
money in his pocket. Mr. Sheridan proceeded to ſhew,
that ſo far from theſe acts being done at the inſtigation of
the Nabob, it was with the utmoſt difficulty that they could
receive from him a formal ſanction, and on this ſubject
ſeveral letters were read by Mr. Adam, and in particular he
reconciled the letters written by Middleton on the 1ſt and
6th of December, by ſaying that in regard to the ſeizure of
the treaſure of the Begums he only required a hint from Mr.
Haſtings, but as the reſumption of the jaghires was likely to
be a ſervice of danger, there nothing leſs than a public order
would ſatisfy Mr. Middleton. After arguing this point
with dexterity, Mr. Sheridan came to the extraordinary
letters of Mr. Middleton, dated on the 30th of December,
wherein they are intended for the confidential and private
uſe of Mr. Haſtings; he denied the truth of what he had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0301701200:40"/>
ſaid in his public diſpatch, which was to be ſubmitted to the
Council, and ſaying at the ſame time that if Mr. Haſtings
wiſhed him to ſay any thing, or to give any other colour to
the proceedings, he was ready to do it. Mr. Sheridan,
after placing this diſgraceful ſubſerviency in ſo glaring a
point of view, requeſted Mr. Adam to read other letters
neceſſary to illuſtrate this part of the charge, and to ſhew
the anxious pains and ſolicitude of Mr. Haſtings to eſtabliſh
ſomething like an excuſe for the turpitude of his conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>While theſe letters were reading, Mr. Sheridan, who
was ſeized with a ſudden, though flight indiſpoſition,
retired to the Managers room. He was, after ſome
refreſhment, deſirous of proceeding; but his friends
perſuaded him to the contrary; and Mr. Fox came
into the Court, and ſaid, that Mr. Sheridan being by
his indiſpoſition prevented from doing that juſtice to
the charge which it was his wiſh to do, the Managers
requeſted that their Lordſhips would be pleaſed to
adjourn, and appoint another day on which he might
proceed.</p>
            <p>Their Lordſhips accordingly withdrew, and ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to the Houſe of Commons, that the Court will ſit
again on Friday the 13th.</p>

            </head>
            <p>MR. SHERIDAN roſe, and being in a great meaſure
recovered from the indiſpoſition which prevented him
from proceeding on Tueſday, reſumed his ſpeech, by thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Lordſhips for the indulgence they had ſhewn him,
and aſſured them that nothing but poſitive inability to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
on Tueſday, in a manner worthy of the importance,
and the dignity of his cauſe, could have induced him to
give them the trouble of ſitting another day.</p>
            <p>He then reminded their Lordſhips, that in commenting
on the evidence reſpecting the reſumption of the jaghires,
and the plunder of the Begums, he had left off with the
public and private correſpondence between Mr. Haſtings
and Mr. Middleton. This correſpondence demanded the
moſt minute attention, for it contained all the facts of that
foul and unmanly conſpiracy; it contained a true account of
the cauſe of that conſpiracy, and alſo the quibbles, the
tricks, the mean ſhifts and evaſions, by which it had been
attempted to conceal it.</p>
            <p>On the public correſpondence, as contraſted with the
private, he animadverted with the moſt penetrating acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and expoſed the groſs contradictions, the laboured
fallacies, and ſtudied miſrepreſentations that pervaded the
whole.—Their Lordſhips would naturally enquire with ſome
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0301701200:42"/>
degree of ſurpriſe, how the private letters that were thus to
eſtabliſh the guilt of their authors had come to light.—In
the middle of December, 1782, a coldneſs had taken place
between Mr. Haſtings and Mr. Middleton. Mr. Haſtings had
been hurt at the tardineſs with which Middleton proceeded,
and had charged him with the heinous offence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
two days forbearance from the Nabob to his mother.
—From this moment ſhyneſs and ſuſpicion between the
principal and the agent took place. Mr. Middleton heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
about the expediency of the meaſure, and began to
doubt whether the advantage would be equal to the riſk.
Mr. Haſtings, whether he apprehended that Middleton was
retarded by any return of humanity or ſentiments of juſtice,
by any ſecret combination with the Begum and her ſon, or
a wiſh to take the lion's ſhare of the plunder to himſelf, was
incenſed at the delay. Mr. Middleton repreſented the unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
of the Nabob to put in execution the reſumption of
the jaghires; the low ſtate of his finances; that his troops
were mutinous for want of pay; and that his life had been
in danger from an inſurrection among them. That in this
moment of diſtreſs he had offered one hundred thouſand
pounds, in addition to a like ſum paid before, as an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for the reſumption which was demanded of him. Of
this offer, however, it appeared the Nabob knew nothing.
In conferring an obligation, it was ſometimes contrived,
from motives of delicacy, that the name of the donor ſhould
be concealed from the perſon obliged; but here was delicacy
of a new ſort—the perſon conferring the favour was to be
kept ignorant that he had conferred it. Yet, after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of Middleton in 1783, there was the ſame friendly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
the ſame fraudulent familiarity, between him and
Mr. Haſtings, that had exiſted before this difference took
place. He was brought down in December, 1782, and no
charge was brought againſt him till April following. Then
it was that Mr. Haſtings, in a ſudden fit of juſtice, preferred
the charge againſt him, and threw down his letters on the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0301701200:43"/>
Council-table. Whatever was the meaning of this charge,
whether it was a juggle to elude enquiry, or whether it was
intended to make an impreſſion at Fyzabad; whether Mr.
Haſtings drew up the charge, and inſtructed Mr. Middleton
to draw up an eaſy defence; or whether Middleton drew up
the charge, and Mr. Haſtings the defence, there appeared in
the whole tranſaction the ſame habitual colluſion in which
they lived—and it ended in a rhapſody, a repartee, and a
poetical quotation. By this act of providential folly, the
private letters were produced, and the production of them
was concluſive proof of the conſpiracy. The private letters
were the only part of the correſpondence to be looked to.
They were written in the confidence of private communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without any of the motives to palliate and colour
facts, to confound and miſlead the judgment, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
on the very face of the public correſpondence.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan then referred to a letter from Lucknow,
written under ſuch particular circumſtances, and at ſuch a
particular period, that had the alledged rebellion of the
Begums ever exiſted, but in imagination, it muſt have been
mentioned in that letter. Where then was the proof of the
rebellion? Not where it ought naturally to be found, but in
the affidavits collected by Sir Elijah Impey—In the fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
public correſpondence between him, Mr. Haſtings,
and Mr. Middleton. In that letter there was no mention of
rebellion. It was indeed ſaid, that if ſuch meaſures were
rigorouſly purſued as had been ſet on foot, the people might
be driven from murmur to reſiſtance, and riſe up in arms
againſt their oppreſſors. Then indeed a little providential
ſlaughter would ſubſtantiate the rebellion which they wiſhed
to find, and afford a pretext for premeditated plunder. But
there was a clumſineſs in the fraud, a coarſeneſs in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
which defeated its purpoſe, and expoſed it to detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>He animadverted with much ſeverity on the conduct of
Sir Elijah Impey, in collecting the affidavits. At one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0301701200:44"/>
he appeared in Oude, at another in Chunar, at a third
in Benares, collecting affidavits. The gravity of his buſineſs
and the vivacity, the rapidity, the celerity of his move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
made a ſingular contraſt. To him might have been
applied the words of Hamlet to the ghoſt, "What, True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny!
are you there?" Like the ghoſt he was heard in
every quarter crying aloud, <hi>ſwear!</hi> But the ſimilitude
went no farther; he was never heard to give the injunction,
<q>
                  <l>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy ſoul contrive</l>
                  <l>Againſt thy mother ought.</l>
               </q>
In the memorable private letter from Mr. Middleton of
the 28th of December, 1781, in which he acknowledged
the receipt of a private letter from Mr. Haſtings, although
no private letters from the priſoner had been produced—a
circumſtance which could only be accounted for, and ariſe
from the habitual awe in which Middleton was kept by the
domineering power and faſcinating influence of his maſter.
In this letter, Middleton told him, that in the preſent fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
ſtate of the country, the reſumption could not be
accompliſhed but with infinite hazard—At the ſame time
Mr. Johnſon wrote him to the ſame purpoſe. The words of
his letter were memorable. He thought it would require a
<hi>campaign</hi> to carry into execution the orders for the reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jaghires. A campaign againſt whom! Againſt
the officers and army of their ally, the Nabob, who had given
the order. This reſumption was ſtated to be for his good,
and for the good of his country, and it was only to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
by a campaign. Such was the manner in which
the Engliſh, under the auſpices of Mr. Haſtings, protected
their allies in India. The protection of the Engliſh was the
miſery and ruin of the protected. It was the protection of
the vulture to the lamb, which covers while it devours its
prey—which ſtretching its baleful pinions, and hovering in
mid air, diſperſes the kites and leſſer birds of prey, and
ſaves the innocent and helpleſs victim from all talons but its
own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0301701200:45"/>
It was curious to remark, that in the correſpondence of
theſe creatures of Mr. Haſtings, and in their earneſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to diſſuade him from the reſumption of the Jaghires,
not a word is mentioned of the meaſure's being contrary to
honour, to faith, derogatory to national character, unmanly
or unprincipled.—No ſuch thing—They knew the man to
whom they were writing, and their only arguments were,
that it was contrary to policy, to expediency—and that the
event was not likely to proſper in the only way in which it
could be worth the attempt—in the accumulation of money.
Not one word did they mention of the juſt claims which the
Nabob had to the gratitude and friendſhip of the Engliſh—
Not one ſyllable of the treaty by which we were bound to
protect him—Not one ſyllable of the relation which ſubſiſted
between him and the ladies they were about to plunder—
Not one ſyllable was hinted about juſtice or mercy—nothing
was ever addreſſed to him but the apprehenſion that the
money to be procured would not be worth the danger and
labour with which it muſt be attended. Such was the ſource
and origin of all his actions, and it was that baſe and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
motive that, urging him to every ſpecies of meanneſs
and of cruelty, did give ſuch a ſtamp and impreſſion to his
acts as made them unparalleled in ancient or modern hiſtory.
He would be bold to ſay, that nothing could be found in the
hiſtory of human turpitude, nothing in the nervous delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and penetrating brevity of Tacitus, nothing in the
luminous and luxuriant pages of Gibbon, or of any other
hiſtorian, dead or living, who, ſearching into meaſures and
characters with the rigour of truth, preſented to our abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
depravity in its blackeſt ſhapes, could equal, in the
groſſneſs of the guilt, in the hardneſs of heart with which
it was conducted, or in the low and groveling motive, the
acts and character of Mr. Haſtings—He, who in the baſe
deſire of ſtripping two helpleſs women, could ſtir the ſon to
riſe up in vengeance againſt them—who when that ſon had
certain touches of nature in his breaſt—certain feelings of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0301701200:46"/>
an awakened conſcience to indicate that he was a man—ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
that ſon of entertaining peeviſh objections to the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and ſacrifice of his mother—Who having deſtroyed in
his boſom all thought—all reflection—all memory—all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience—all
tenderneſs and duty as a ſon—all dignity as a
monarch—having deſtroyed his character, and depopulated
his country, at length brought him to violate the deareſt ties
of nature, and countenance the deſtruction of his parents—
and who having thus debauched this poor and miſerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of his crimes to his purpoſe, deceived and ruined
him in turn. He—this inhuman violator of all ties, ſacred
and profane, had in this ſingle crime, he would be bold to
ſay, no parallel nor prototype in the old world, or the new,
from the day of original ſin to the preſent hour.</p>
            <p>And yet when in this climax he thought he had got to the
ſummit and pinnacle of his guilt, he found ſomething ſtill
more tranſcendently flagitious. He particularly alluded to
his famous letter, falſely dated the 15th of February, 1782,
in which, at the very moment that he had given the order
for the entire deſtruction of the Begums, and for the reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the jaghires, expreſſed to the Nabob the warm and
lively intereſt which he took in his welfare—the ſincerity and
ardour of his friendſhip—and that though his preſence was
imminently wanted at Calcutta, he could not reſt a moment
without coming to the Nabob's aſſiſtance, and in the mean
time, he had ſent four regiments to his aid.—So deliberate
and cool—ſo hypocritical and inſinuating was the villainy of
this man! The heart was exaſperated by the malignity of
this arch treaſon—But at length the Nabob was on his guard
—He could not be deceived by this maſk—The offer of the
four regiments developed the object of Mr. Haſtings.—He
perceived the dagger bunglingly concealed in the hand that
was held out with a ſmile to meet him—and we accordingly
heard no more from the Nabob of reliance on the friendſhip
of Mr. Haſtings.—This letter was ſent at the very time when
the troops had ſurrounded the walls of Fyzabad, and now
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0301701200:47"/>
began the ſcene of horrors, which, if he merely wiſhed to
rouſe their Lordſhips feelings, he ſhould only have occaſion
minutely to deſcribe. To ſtate the violence committed on
that palace, which the piety of the kingdom had raiſed for
the retreat and ſecluſion of the objects of its pride and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
He thought he ſaw innocence repoſing in thoſe ſhades,
rendered ſacred by ſuperſtition.—Venerable age and helpleſs
infancy here found an aſylum, and to the violation of this
ſcene were ſent an Impey to invigorate the flagging conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of a Middleton;—and an Ali Khan aſſiſted by the ſtouter
villainy of a Hyder Beg. Rapine, outrage, and violence
followed in the train, while Haſtings, though ſtanding aloof,
was in fact the maſter general of the war, and through the
whole of the dreadful ſcene of horror their Lordſhips ſaw
him—"ride in the whirlwind, and direct the ſtorm."</p>
            <p>He now with an admirable accuracy and force of reaſoning
went over the correſpondence, which then paſſed between
Middleton and the Begums; he particularly alluded to the
letter ſent by the Begum to Middleton, with his anſwer, in
which he declared himſelf equally the friend of the Nabob
and the Begum, although he had previouſly ſworn in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, that he thought ſhe had hoſtile deſigns againſt
her ſon and the Engliſh, and had made up his conſcience to
ſtrip her of every thing ſhe poſſeſſed. He execrated the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſycophancy of this conduct, that like ſome of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of India, cringed to its prey, and fawned on the objects
of its vengeance. In going over theſe private letters, he came
to that from Mr. Middleton, which the Council for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
had been anxious to have read to the end, in order to
publiſh an anecdote which they thought would do ſomething
towards ſupporting the character of Mr. Middleton. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
ſome expreſſions of earneſt and anxious ſolicitude for
the recovery of a beloved ſon—and which they meant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate,
were indications of feeling, and of his ſenſe of the
nature of the relative duty and affection which ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the parent and the child. How fortunate they had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0301701200:48"/>
been in their deſire of having this anecdote heard, he knew
not—He confeſſed he thought it did not tend to raiſe the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Mr. Middleton—but on the contrary, it operated
very much to his prejudice. It would not be imputed to
him, that ſpeaking abſtractedly, he conſidered the trait of
parental tenderneſs as a degrading feature in the human heart.
Their Lordſhips knew well the force of the ſoft and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
relation which ſubſiſted between parent and child; but
ſurely it would not be ſaid, that the circumſtance brought
to their Lordſhips view by the Counſel, of the fact of Mr.
Middleton's having this ſentiment and feeling in his boſom
was therefore intitled to commendation, when with the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his own boſom he was outraging it in others. Was it
not an aggravation of his guilt, that he who felt the ardent
ſolicitude of a parent, and who conſequently muſt be ſenſible
of the reciprocal feelings of a child, could bring himſelf to
tear aſunder, and to violate all thoſe dear and ſacred bonds!
Did it not enhance his guilt, that his cruelty was not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of ideotic ignorance, or of ſavage barbarity?—That he
whoſe ſoul was thus ſenſible to the impreſſions of tenderneſs
and love, ſhould be ſo abandoned as to ſacrifice thoſe feelings
to the inhuman will of the tyrant whom he ſerved. He aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that it increaſed and magnified his guilt. He would have
been leſs criminal had he been inſenſible of tenderneſs—leſs
criminal if he had not been ſo thoroughly acquainted with
the true quality of parental love and filial duty. [Here Mr.
Sheridan gave a picture of filial duty, which, as a piece of
chaſte and beautiful painting in language, we know not where
to equal, and which we are utterly unable to copy.]</p>
            <p>Filial duty, he ſaid, it was impoſſible by words to deſcribe,
but deſcription by words was unneceſſary. It was that duty
which they all felt and underſtood, and which required not
the powers of language to explain. It was in truth more
properly to be called a principle than a duty. It required
not the aid of memory—it needed not the exerciſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
—it awaited not the ſlow deliberations of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0301701200:49"/>
—It flowed ſpontaneouſly from the fountain of our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
—It was involuntary in our natures.—It was a quality
of our being, innate, and coeval with life, which though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
cheriſhed as a paſſion was independent of our men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
powers.—It was earlier than all intelligence in our ſouls.
—It diſplayed itſelf in the earlieſt impulſes of the heart, and
was an emotion of fondneſs that returned in ſmiles of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
the affectionate ſolicitude—the tender anxieties—the
endearing attentions experienced before memory began, but
which were not leſs dear for not being remembered.—It was
the ſacrament of nature in our hearts, by which the union
of parent and child was ſealed and rendered perfect in the
community of love, and which, ſtrengthening and ripening
with life, acquired vigour from the underſtanding, and was
moſt lively and active when moſt wanted—when thoſe who
had ſupported infancy were ſinking into age, and when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
and decrepitude found their beſt ſolace in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the children they had reared—But he was aſhamed to
take up ſo much of their Lordſhips time in attempting to
give a cold picture of filial duty, when he ſaw ſo many
breathing teſtimonies in the aſſembly that ſurrounded him—
and when he ſaw every feature of that aſſembly beaming and
erecting itſelf in confeſſion of the univerſal principle.</p>
            <p>The manner of diſpoſing of the goods violently ſeized from
the unfortunate Princeſſes, their jewels; their wearing appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
their furniture even to their table utenſils, though in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
objects when compared with other circumſtances of
their unhappy ſituation, was marked with injuſtice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
—They were ſold, or at leaſt put up to ſale, by auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
—a pretended ſale, where there were no bidders, who
had not previouſly agreed on what they ſhould purchaſe, and
how much they ſhould pay for dividing the ſpoil. This the
Begum herſelf lamented in very affecting terms, in a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
to Mr. Middleton, when ſhe ſays that ſhe finds,
from woeful experience, that even bullion, gold, and jewels,
loſe their value the moment it is known they come from her.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0301701200:50"/>
But the rapacity of Middleton did not ſtop there, for after
having thus fraudulently diſpoſed of the goods, a new claim
was made for the deficiency, and new cruelties were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
to enforce the payment of a ſum which did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
a part of the original fine. Attempts were made to
find out new crimes and new debts due by the Nabob to the
Company, though he had already offended to the amount of
600,000l. Mr. Haſtings writes to Mr. Middleton not to
come to a final ſettlement with the Nabob till he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
his CASH-BOOK, which was the faithful record of the
crimes of their allies, and in which he had already diſcovered
260,000l. worth of treaſon, that no perſon had ever before
dreamed of. He accuſes by the <hi>Multiplication Table,</hi> tries
by the <hi>Rule of Three,</hi> and condemns, not by the ſublime
inſtitute of Timur, or the ſimple maxims of Engliſh juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,
but by the unerring rules of <hi>Cocker's Arithmetic.</hi>
—He then proceeded to animadvert on the teſtimony of
Major Scott, whom he called the incomparable agent of
Mr. Haſtings. He had come to the bar, and ſaid, that
though the Defence of Mr. Haſtings had not been drawn up
by himſelf, yet there was one paragraph which he (Mr.
Haſtings) had written with his own <hi>proper</hi> hand. That pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph
was avowing the reſumption of the Jaghires, and
averring it to be conſiſtent with the dictates of humanity,
policy, and juſtice. "Give me the pen, ſaid Mr. Haſtings;
"I will defend the meaſure as juſt and neceſſary. Do you
find <hi>memory,</hi> I will find <hi>character!</hi>" And thus the <hi>twin
warriors</hi> came into the field, each in his proper ſphere of
action, and armed for either purpoſe. Such had been the
daring and unbluſhing defence of Mr. Haſtings, for the
commiſſion of an act, on which their Lordſhips could have
but one opinion. That it was not conſiſtent with the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of juſtice, he appealed to thoſe whoſe peculiar province
it was to adminiſter juſtice. Thoſe of your Lordſhips, ſaid
be, who have been diſtinguiſhed as Stateſmen, will ſpurn at
the idea of its being a meaſure that can be juſtified on the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0301701200:51"/>
principles of good policy; and that it is not to be defended
by the laws of humanity, he would appeal to that venerable
part of the auguſt tribunal who heard him—they who had
ever proved themſelves the diſtinguiſhed advocates of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and truth.</p>
            <p>He now came to the recital of the cruelties perpetrated by
the agents of Mr. Haſtings, which he pledged himſelf to
bring home to the bold culprit at the bar. The firſt act of
their tyranny was the impriſonment of the Miniſters of the
Begums, who were perſons of conſiderable eminence and
diſtinction in that country, and who had enjoyed much of
the confidence and favour of the late Nabob. Not ſatisfied
with this, they were loaded with irons, and ſuffered the
combined horrors of want, impriſonment, and ignominy;
but what aggravated the ſcandalous injuſtice of this meaſure
was, that they had ſuffered without even the formality of an
enquiry, while that <hi>arch traitor,</hi> Shumſhaw Cawn, though
accuſed of diſaffection to the Engliſh Government, was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to go about without notice; he had been ſo much
neglected by thoſe in power that he had not even been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented
with <hi>fetters,</hi> the uſual badge of diſtinction, which
it was the practice to beſtow on opulent traitors.—To his
poverty he owed his protection.—The unfortunate Miniſters
of the Begums not having yet ſatisfied the rapacity of theſe
plunderers, were ordered to Chunar, where the Engliſh flag
was flying as the ſignal of oppreſſion, there to have corporal
puniſhment inflicted on them, and one of them actually ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it, to the diſgrace of the honour, the juſtice, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
of the Britiſh nation. What muſt have been the
feelings of the Britiſh officers upon that occaſion, he muſt
leave thoſe to ſay who were preſent. To Major Gilpin he
gave much praiſe, not only for the candid evidence he gave
at the bar; but for his humane endeavour to alleviate the
ſufferings of the unhappy women, for they were the next
objects of Mr. Middleton's <hi>humanity.</hi> The conduct of Mr.
Johnſon was of a different kind, though he certainly had
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0301701200:52"/>
ſome claim to praiſe from his <hi>forbearance</hi>—he very <hi>humanely</hi>
writes to Middleton that he did not think it would be <hi>worth
while</hi> to put to death 2000 women and children for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of enforcing prompt payment of their demands; but
actuated by the fear of the dreadful reſponſibility under
which Mr. Haſtings had placed all his agents, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to carry his orders into execution, and took poſſeſſion
of the Palace. The ſufferings of the women were patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
deſcribed by Major Gilpin. In a letter dated the 30th
October, 1782, he writes as follows:—<q rend="inline">Laſt night, about
eight o'clock, the women in the Khord Mohul, (Leſſer
Palace) or Zenana, (womens apartment under the charge
of Latafut Ally Khan) aſſembled on the tops of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
crying in a moſt lamentable manner for food; that
for the laſt four days they had got but a very ſcanty allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and that yeſterday they had got none. The melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
cries of famine are more eaſily imagined than
deſcribed.—</q>After ſuch a deſcription of calamity, he
ſaid, he would not treſpaſs on the feelings of their Lordſhips
by any comments on it. Their indignation againſt the
author of thoſe calamities rendered any further obſervations
on that ſubject unneceſſary. It was now for him to prove
that Mr. Haſtings was reſponſible for the actions of his
agents. That he was reſponſible for the Treaty of Chunar,
he believed, would ſcarcely be diſputed—though Mr. Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton
had on the laſt day of his examination refuſed to
anſwer ſome queſtions on that ſubject, leſt it might criminate
himſelf. With an avarice for infamy, and an anxious
deſire of monopolizing guilt, Mr. Middleton, when queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
about his conduct at Fyzabad, had anſwered that he
alone was to blame, for Mr. Haſtings had written an angry
letter to him, diſapproving of what he had done; but what,
ſaid he, will be your Lordſhips aſtoniſhment, when you are
told that this letter from Mr. Haſtings contained a gentle
reproach to Mr. Middleton, not for his want of humanity,
but for his lenity! Such was his anxiety to court infamy,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0301701200:53"/>
and to ſolicit guilt, that he ſcrupled not to encounter igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
when he might have claimed praiſe!</p>
            <p>Mr. Haſtings had urged in his defence, that as he was
not privy to the actions, he could not be reſponſible for the
guilt. This was not true. Mr. Haſtings well knew what
was going forward, though, perhaps, he might be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the miſerable detail. When a perſon in
authority deſires another to do an illegal act, he certainly is,
to all intents and purpoſes, anſwerable for the conſequences.
He becomes the principal in the crime, though he might not
be the actual perpetrator of it, and is conſidered, by every
principle of natural law and natural reaſon, as the firſt object
of puniſhment. What were the orders given by Mr. Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
They were peremptory—and it is proved by Middleton
himſelf, that he could not have carried them into execution
by any other means than thoſe which had been adopted.
Would any man then be hardy enough to aſſert, that Mr.
Haſtings was not in this inſtance anſwerable for the act of his
agent? The communications of Mr. Haſtings and Mr. Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton
had been frequent and uninterrupted; though he muſt
ſay they were more like the ſecret machinations of a banditti
in a cavern, plotting the deſtruction of ſome innocent family.
than the deliberations of Britiſh Repreſentatives in India.</p>
            <p>Mr. Middleton, however, had at leaſt ſome regard to
decorum on particular occaſions, for, in anſwer to Mr.
Haſtings's letter, accuſing him of lenity and forbearance in
the execution of his orders, he anſwers, "That the Nabob
was <hi>ſon</hi> to the Begum whom we were to proceed againſt;
—a <hi>ſon</hi> againſt his <hi>mother</hi> muſt at leaſt ſave <hi>appearances</hi> in
his mode of proceeding." But Mr. Haſtings all along
pretends complete ignorance of the cruelties that were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated,
that is, he was ignorant of the exact number of
laſhes which were inflected, and the preciſe weight of the
iron which formed the fetters.—Such was the miſerable
ſophiſtry by which he defended himſelf, though his guilt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0301701200:54"/>
was the ſame as if he had with his own hand inflicted the
puniſhment.</p>
            <p>He then took notice of that part of Mr. Haſtings's defence,
the object of which was to criminate the reſt of the Board,
or at leaſt to prove that they were equally guilty with him.
Had Sir John Macpherſon then (of whoſe character he
thought highly) no friend that would call him to the bar,
to vindicate himſelf from ſo foul an aſperſion? Was there
nobody to do juſtice to the memory of Mr. Wheeler? For
his own part, he was ready to acquit the Members of the
Board from any ſhare in the guilt of the black catalogue of
Mr. Haſtings's crimes, though their agreeing to ſign the
diſpatch to the Court of Directors, not one paragraph of
which was true, was a very inexcuſable, and even a criminal
credulity. After commenting with great ingenuity and force
of reaſoning on the different paragraphs of the letter to the
Court of Directors, with a view to prove that the whole was
a fabrication, calculated ſolely to promote the views of
Mr. Haſtings, he ſaid, he was convinced that Sir John
Macpherſon was now aſhamed of his credulity, and would
be glad of an opportunity of vindicating himſelf from the
imputed guilt, of which Mr. Haſtings had been anxious to
give to the Board more than fell to their ſhare.</p>
            <p>The tyranny of Mr. Haſtings, he ſaid, was not to be
reconciled to the common rules, nor could it be judged of
by the common ſtandard of tyrants. The atrocious cruelties
of a Nero and a Caligula might be aſcribed to the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
of paſſions inflamed to madneſs, which knew no check,
and which felt no correction. In their delirious career, they
ſuffered no reflection to intervene, and they knew of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſibility
—they had no interval of remorſe, no feeling of
equality—they were born to rule, and they conſidered their
ſubjects as creatures over whom they had a right to domineer.
That ſuch men, with turbulent, head-ſtrong paſſions, ſhould
be tyrants, was not ſo wonderful as it was melancholy. But
how different was the caſe of Mr. Haſtings. He was a cool-thinking,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0301701200:55"/>
deliberate tyrant. Born to no rule—entitled to
no ſuperiority—accuſtomed to converſe, to act, and to live
with his equals—bred in mercantile habits, which forced
him to eſtimate on every meaſure—and entruſted by a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile
Company with a government which was to be carried
on by mercantile principles—Bound to give a faithful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of every tranſaction—and to expoſe not only the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
itſelf, but the motives that led to it—Who could never
go to bed without diſcharging this duty—without balancing
the tranſactions of the day—and reconciling his acts to juſtice
and policy—Who held up, as it were, a glaſs rightly to his
own conſcience, and was bound to purge it. That ſuch a
man ſhould become a tyrant, militated againſt every rational
principle of man.—Yet here we ſaw the monſter—a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
tyrant—a cool, deliberate, reaſoning tyrant—who
violated the rights of man, with a perfect conſciouſneſs of
what thoſe rights were—and who, endowed with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the equal rank, as to freedom, granted by the Deity
to human kind, arraigned the wiſdom of Providence, by
oppoſing its diſpenſations in favour of his ſpecies. A tyrant
againſt man was a libeller of God—and the Court beheld in
the priſoner a creature who had preſumed to deface and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
the beauty and harmony of that ſyſtem which was
originally granted by Heaven for the happineſs of the
earth.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan now drew to his concluſion. He ſaid, their
Lordſhips would not be ſurprized, if, after all that they had
heard, he ſhould think the cauſe for which he ſtood up per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſafe, if he called on them to diſcharge from their
minds all that they had heard of mere language, and only
to attend to facts. A ſtrict examination of the evidence
would ſo fully and thoroughly convince them of the turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the priſoner, that he wiſhed to place the whole cauſe
on that ſingle ground, unornamented by eloquence, and
unaſſiſted by reaſoning. One only paſſage more he ſhould
take notice of.—Mr. Haſtings, in the moment when he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0301701200:56"/>
ſtifled the pretended enquiry into the atrocious acts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
under his own authority, entered a minute of the
moſt remarkable kind:—<q rend="inline">If we cannot heal, let us not
inflame the wounds which have been inflicted. If the
Begums think themſelves aggrieved to ſuch a degree as
to juſtify them in an appeal to a foreign juriſdiction,—</q>
ſpeaking of wounds inflicted by his own poſitive orders—and
talking of a foreign juriſdiction, as if Sir Elijah Impey's
Court at Lucknow had not been a foreign juriſdiction,—<q rend="inline">let us at leaſt permit them to be the judges of their own
feelings, and prefer their complaints before we offer to
redreſs them.—</q>But now came the magnificent paragraph,
to which he requeſted their Lordſhips attention:—<q rend="inline">I hope
I ſhall not depart from the ſimplicity of official language,
in ſaying, the majeſty of Juſtice ought to be approached
with ſolicitation, not deſcend to provoke or invite it,
much leſs to debaſe itſelf by the ſuggeſtion of wrongs,
and the promiſe of redreſs, with the denunciation of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
before trial, and even before accuſation.—</q>
This ſtrutting and pompous apology for not liſtening to the
voice of real juſtice and mercy, he was very much ſurpriſed
to find had met the approbation of Sir John Macpherſon, of
whoſe good ſenſe and underſtanding he had heard a good
report, but who, by the minute which he added, proved
that he had not ſtudied and corrected his taſte for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and beautiful from the immortal leader of this proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
If he dad done ſo, he would have felt and treated
this paſſage as it deſerved—as a piece of bombaſtic jargon,
unworthy of the ſober approbation of the underſtanding.
The Majeſty of Juſtice, in the eyes of Mr. Haſtings, was a
being of terrific horror—a dreadful idol placed in the gloom
of graves, acceſſible only to cringing ſupplication, and
which muſt be approached with offerings, and worſhipped
by ſacrifice. The majeſty of Mr. Haſtings was a being
whoſe decrees were written with blood, and whoſe oracles
were at once obſcure and terrible. From ſuch an idol (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0301701200:57"/>
Mr. Sheridan) I turn my eyes with horror—I turn
them here to this dignified and high tribunal, where the
Majeſty of Juſtice really ſits enthroned.—Here I perceive
the Majeſty of Juſtice in her proper robes of truth and
mercy—chaſte and ſimple—acceſſible and patient—awful
without ſeverity—inquiſitive without meanneſs.—I ſee her
enthroned and ſitting in judgment on a great and momentous
cauſe, in which the happineſs of millions is involved.—
Pardon me, my Lords, if I preſume to ſay, that in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of this great cauſe you are to be envied, as well as
venerated. You poſſeſs the higheſt diſtinction of the human
character; for when you render your ultimate voice on this
cauſe, illuſtrating the dignity of the anceſtors from whom
you ſpring—juſtifying the ſolemn aſſeveration which you
make—vindicating the people of whom you are a part—and
manifeſting the intelligence of the times in which you live—
you will do ſuch an act of mercy and bleſſing to man, as no
men but yourſelves are able to grant.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I have done!</p>
