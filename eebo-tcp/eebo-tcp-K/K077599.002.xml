            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THOUGH the ſtate of affairs in Scotland was calculated to raiſe
the hopes of the court of St. Germains, the Stuart papers for
this year are more curious than important. The Scotiſh Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites
were reſolved to riſk every thing to prevent the union, and the
conſequent ſucceſs of the ſucceſſion in the proteſtant line. The French
had given them ſome expectations of ſupport; but the battles of Ramil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and Turin diſconcerted all their meaſures. The French King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that he could ſpare neither men nor money at preſent; but that
he would ſearch for a more favourable conjuncture to give them the aid
they required. The Tories in England were more cautious than the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites
of Scotland. They wiſhed for the reſtoration of the excluded
family; but they were unwilling to agree to any attempt, during the life
of Queen Anne. They held no direct communication with the court of
St. Germains. The agents of that court, however, had acceſs, as uſual,
to Marlborough and Godolphin, who ſeemed to give private aſſurances
of zeal for the Pretender, when they, particularly the former, publickly
avowed their attachment to the houſe of Hannover, while both promoted
the ſucceſſion in the proteſtant line. It appears that the excluded family
had turned their eyes, as early as the preſent year, towards the King of
Sweden; who, by poſſeſſing himſelf of Saxony, and dethroning King
Auguſtus, became, in ſome meaſure, the umpire of the affairs of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</p>

                  <p>
                     <date>March 21.</date> What you now write concerning that part of the quit-rents
which are lately become due to your couſin Wiſely [the King]
ſufficiently ſhews her undoubted right to them according to law; but I
fear there will be many difficulties, not eaſy to overcome, that will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
her getting poſſeſſion of them, through the neglect of her truſtee,
of which we ſhall know more, when you have conferred with Mr. Goul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton
[Godolphin] about it. Your couſin's title is certainly good in law,
both againſt Young [princeſs Anne] and againſt that other perſon [Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover]
whoſe name I forgot, who at preſent, as you ſay, puts in a claim.
I am glad to hear you ſay that thoſe who have long ſince ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to pay Pleſſington's [the King's] debts, make ſteps as if they did
deſign to be honeſt at laſt; though I do not find that you have had any
freſh aſſurance from Mr. Armſworth [Marlborough] or Mr. Gilburn
[Godolphin], who I know are full of other buſineſs at preſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <date>April 5.</date> What I hear concerning Hanmer [Hannover] and his
knight [Sir Rowland Gwyne] is very extraordinary, and I believe will
make ſome diviſion in Wanley's [the Whigs] family, of which ſome are
for joining immediately in company with the merchant Hanmer [Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover],
and others of them, with Mr. Brag [in the parliament] have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly
appeared againſt it. I alſo believe that thoſe few of Kenzy's
relations [Tories], that ſtood up for Hanmer [Hannover], have done
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0950500102:12"/>
but little good either to Hanmer [Hannover] or to themſelves. It is
very probable, as you ſay, that the two merchants, Goulſton [Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin]
and Armſworth [Marlborough] have had a great hand in all this,
but whether with an honeſt intention of paying their old debts or not,
time muſt ſhow. You are much in the right not to move in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the quit-rents, lately fallen in, whilſt Mr. Brag [parliament] is
in town, and that will come on better next term. In the mean time,
you may have opportunity of conſulting with Mr. Goulſton [Godolphin]
about it, and as you may find him diſpoſed, you may make a pretty
near gueſs of the ſucceſs of that and of other matters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <date>April 25.</date> I ſhould be very glad to hear of your having had ſome
communication with Mr. Armſworth [Marlborough] about the old
debts, before his going into the country [abroad]; but if that cannot be,
I hope at leaſt that ſomething will be ſaid about that matter to captain
Gourdon [colonel Sackville], of which I ſuppoſe you will have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>
                     <date>June 6.</date> I find that your kinſman, Mr. Wiſely [the King], is very
well pleaſed with the way in which you proceed about the recovery of
that part of the quit-rents lately fallen in, and applying them to the
payment of the debts formerly contracted. As to the ſucceſs of this
matter, much will depend upon the honeſty of Mr. Young's ſolicitor,
[the princeſs of Denmark's miniſter] Goulſton [Godolphin], for he has in
his hands wherewithall to clear that matter, and therefore a ſeaſonable
application ought to be made to him.</p>
                  <p>Being a perſon concerned in theſe debts, though I can pretend no
great ſkill in the law, yet I ſhould be glad theſe queries might be made
to thoſe that are of Wiſely's [Queen's] council: 1ſt, Whether Wiſely
has not at preſent a clear title in law, as it now ſtands, to thoſe quit-rents?
2dly, And if ſo, whether he may not make them over to ſome
truſtees, for the payment of thoſe debts, by a deed that will ſtand good
in law? This I mention becauſe I do not ſee, at preſent, how the title
is devolved from Wiſely [the King] to Young [Queen Anne]; but you
that are upon the place can better judge of theſe matters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <date>June 28.</date> In your laſt you gave full ſatisfaction to the two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
I had put to you in mine of the ſixth of June; ſo that nothing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0950500102:13"/>
otherwiſe is to be done in the buſineſs of the quit-rents than according to
the plan laid down by you, by the advice of counſel upon the place
for, as you ſay, Mr. Brag [parliament] is a very angry gentleman naturally,
and his bitterneſs ought not to be ſtirred. Mr. Manning's [the King of
France] affairs have gone ſo much backwards of late, that there is little
hope of his being able to lay down the ſum neceſſary to redeem the
mortgage (an army for an invaſion), ſo that we muſt neceſſarily make
the beſt of the promiſes given, by thoſe other merchants, which you
know have been ſuch, as no honeſt man could make and not perform,
when able to do ſo. Nor is there, at preſent, any queſtion to be made
of their ability, having almoſt all the trade in their hands; ſo that, if
they fail in the performance, the ſhame will be theirs, and the loſs
will be ours."</p>

The regiment of guards, without a colonel ſince Ramſay's death,
conſiſts of 16 companies, each company 40 men, including ſerjeants,
corporals, and drums, is 640.</p>
                     <p>The earl of Dalhouſie, firſt lieutenant colonel, a young man with a
very ſmall eſtate, no good manager, has debts, and ſometimes forced to
take ſanctuary in the abbey of Holyrood-Houſe; but being of a loyal
family and ſo educated, it is preſumed he has good inclinations; and it
may be reaſonably expected, that the King's preſence will draw him, and
all ſuch to his Majeſty's intereſt and ſervice. The other lieutenant colonel
—Stewart, brother to the earl of Galloway, is thought to have good
inclinations; and to my certain knowledge, he was for the grand reſolve.
The major and following officers of this regiment, are reputed well
affected; Thomas Hamilton, ſecond major, John Murray, James Scott,
John Hamilton, William Sharp,—Scott,—Stewart, captains; William
Murray and James Ogilvie, lieutenants; the firſt two captains, and
the two lieutenants, I know to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>The troop of horſe guards, commanded by the earl of Argyle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of 100 gentlemen; at leaſt, ſhould be ſo.</p>
                     <p>The lord Forbes, firſt lieutenant, a bigotted whig, little ſenſe, little
eſtate, and diſloyal. My lord Ballantyne, the other lieutenant, one of a
very ordinary capacity and little or no eſtate; at the revolution, and for
ſeveral years after, was eſteemed very loyal; but having ſquandered a
good eſtate, and falling in with the duke of Queenſberry, he bought him,
at the price of his poſt. Mr. John Kerr, the firſt cornet, ſuch as the
captain; the other Archibald Douglas, was at and after the Revolution
thought very loyal, and is ſtill reputed well affected; but much under
the influence of the duke of Queenſberry. I am credibly informed, that
many of the gentlemen of the troop are well affected.</p>
                     <p>Two troops, or companies of grenadiers, on horſeback; each conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of 30 men, ranked as guards, 60.</p>
                     <p>The earl of Crawford, colonel, a good-natured man, and brave; has
little or no eſtate, and influenced by the earl of Arran. The captains of
<hi>(ſome words illegible)</hi> lord Cumberland, oldeſt ſon to the earl of
Balcarras, and—Chrichton, heir male to the late earl of Dumfries.</p>

                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0950500102:15"/>
The firſt is a very young gentleman, that ſeems to promiſe no great
things; the other is thought to have ſome good inclinations towards the
King.</p>
                     <p>Major general Maitland's regiment, in the garriſon of Inverlochy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
(as I remember) of twelve companies; each company 40 men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
ſerjeants, corporals, and drums, 480.</p>
                     <p>Robert Keith, firſt lieutenant colonel. I have known him from my
infancy. He always was before, and at the Revolution, very loyal; but I
think, ſince that unhappy time, he is much corrupted in his principles; yet,
at the ſame time, I judge his old imbibed loyalty is not entirely wore out,
but that he may be retrieved; and, if I am commanded or permitted,
I will uſe my beſt endeavours to perſuade and engage him to his duty;
for I know he has a great friendſhip for me, and will not deceive me.
The other lieutenant colonel of this regiment, is Mr. Patrick Ogilvie,
ſecond ſon to the earl of Findlater, who will always be ſuch as his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
at leaſt ſo long as he is chancellor. Yet he has many times, with
great aſſeverations, ſaid, that he never would do any thing againſt the
King's intereſt. Other officers of that regiment I know not; but in
general, I am informed, that ſome of them are well affected, and it is
preſumed, many of the common ſoldiers are ſo, becauſe moſt of them
are Highlandmen, and of conſequence thought loyal.</p>
                     <p>Lord Strathnaver's regiment of foot, conſiſts of 10 companies; each
company 30 men, including ſerjeants, corporals, and drums, is 300.</p>
                     <p>This colonel is a very young man, and his father, the earl of Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
being of ill principles, it may reaſonably be preſumed he is ſo.
Yet I am told by ſome of his relations, that he is much better diſpoſed
than his father. The earl of Glencairn, lieutenant colonel, I know is
loyally inclined; and I have it from moſt unqueſtionable authors, that
he has often ſaid, he never would do any thing againſt the King, and,
as I remember, he voted the grand reſolution; and ſeveral captains and
ſubalterns in the regiment are reputed well affected.</p>
                     <p>The laird of Grant, younger; his regiment is in companies, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, the ſame with Strathnaver's, 300.</p>
                     <p>The colonel before he got the regiment, was reputed loyal; but ſince
he had it, by Argyle's procurement, he is conſidered, as much influenced
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0950500102:16"/>
by that lord. Bruce of Kennith, the lieutenant colonel, is reputed
loyal, as are ſeveral other officers in that regiment.</p>
                     <p>The earl of Lothian's regiment of dragoons, as I remember, conſiſts
of ſix companies; each company, including ſerjeants, corporal, and
drum, is 30 men, 180.</p>
                     <p>The colonel's character is already given. The lieutenant colonel is
ſon to Pollwarth, now called earl of Marchmont; when the late earl of
Hume liſted, this lieutenant colonel was thought well affected, and very
much under the influence of Hume; but what to ſay of him now, I
know not.</p>
                     <p>The major of this regiment, John Johnſton, of Weſtraw, is reputed
to have loyal inclinations, being much managed that way by his very
loyal lady; but he is much under the influence of his chief, the earl of
Annandale, whom few of any ſide muſt truſt.</p>
                     <p>The Maſter of Carmichael's regiment of dragoons is, in troops and
number of men, every way the ſame with Lothian's, 180.</p>
                     <p>This colonel, like his father, my lord Carmichael, now called earl
Hyndford, is conſidered as not well affected to the King's intereſt, and
his lieutenant colonel—Wiſhart far leſs; being a bigotted whig, the
ſon of a miniſter of that pernicious tribe. But Pollock of that ilk, the
major, though he is ſomething whiggiſhly inclined, Kilmaronock tells me,
that he has often, with great aſſeverations, ſaid to him, that when the
King comes, he ſhall have him and his troop; and this is all the loyalty
I know in this regiment, except one lieutenant Graham, who I know to
be well affected.</p>
                     <p>Three independent companies, for ſuppreſſing the Highland thieves
and robbers; each company 100 men, 300.</p>
                     <p>The firſt independent company is commanded by captain Campbell, of
Finnab; ſuch as his chief, Argyle.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond independent company, commanded by captain William
Grant; generally reputed loyal.</p>
                     <p>The third independent company, commanded by major M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Kenzie;
reputed loyal.</p>
                     <p>

The caſtle of Edinburgh, commanded by earl of Leven, governor.
The garriſon, as I remember, conſiſts of 100.</p>
                     <p>The governor's character is already given.</p>
                     <p>The lieutenant-governor, colonel James Stuart, one that was bred in
Dumbarton's regiment, and before and at the Revolution was eſteemed
very loyal, and is ſtill reputed to have loyal inclinations, but is a little
influenced by the duke of Queenſberry.</p>
                     <p>Major Cout, the lieutenant of the company, is a moſt bigotted whig,
and reputed very diſloyal.</p>
                     <p>The caſtle of Stirling is commanded by the earl of Mar, governor.
The garriſon conſiſts of 100 men.</p>
                     <p>What to ſay of the governor I know not well. He was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to have loyal inclinations; and to my certain knowledge, very
much courted by the earl of Arran, to be brought entirely in, both to
the intereſt of the King and country, and Arran once thought himſelf
ſure of him. But, laſt ſeſſion of parliament, when the duke of Queenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry
came to Scotland, he no ſooner came, but he drew Mar from
the country party, with the bait of ſecretary of ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The lieutenant governor is colonel John Erſkine; one that is ſuppoſed
will always be for what the court has a mind to, ſo long as he enjoys
any tolerable good poſt. But—Shaw, of Saughy, lieutenant of the
company, is reputed to have loyal inclinations.</p>
                     <p>The caſtle of Dumbarton is commanded by Maſter Archibald Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
brother to Argyle. Who is the lieutenant, I know not; but the
garriſon, I think, conſiſts of 60 men.</p>
                     <p>The caſtle of Blackneſs is commanded by the earl of Buchan, lately
made governor; and the garriſon, as I ſuppoſe, conſiſts of about 60
men; but who the lieutenant is, I know not.</p>
                     <p>The number of the whole forces, in field and garriſon, 2860.</p>
                     <p>This account of the forces is calculated according to the eſtabliſhment;

It is not to be doubted but the King of Sweden will be perſuaded that
theſe things merit ſerious reflections; and that he will find no other means
ſo effectual for preventing the calamities with which he is threatened, as
to employ all his force to re-eſtabliſh the King of England; and there is
reaſon to hope, that he will make no difficulty of contributing to this,
when he will ſee that prudence, juſtice, and glory, concur in it.</p>

               <p>THE Whigs, by intimidating Godolphin, had procured the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of government in the elections for members of the new par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which met, for the firſt time, on the twenty-fifth of October,
1705. Finding themſelves the majority, John Smith, one of their own
party, was choſen ſpeaker of the houſe of commons, notwithſtanding the
vehement oppoſition of the Tories. William Cowper, a man of heavy and
confuſed parts, but who was attached to the ſame principles, was made, by
their influence, keeper of the great ſeal; and in general, the whole cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of preferment ran through the ſame channel. The Tories, vexed at
the loſs of their influence, acted a part which exhibited a curious ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of that glaring inconſiſtency of conduct, into which the ſpirit of
party has too often betrayed mankind. To haraſs their political oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
they endeavoured to take poſſeſſion of their ground; and though
they were ſuppoſed to be enemies to the ſucceſſion of the houſe of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover,
the lord Haverſham, as the mouth of the party, moved, in the
houſe of lords, for an addreſs to the Queen, to invite the princeſs So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia
into England. The motion was rejected by the Whigs, who then
poſſeſſed the whole influence of government. There were, however,
brought in two bills, which were deemed a great ſecurity to the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſucceſſion: the firſt, appointing a regency on the event of the
Queen's death; and the ſecond for naturalizing the princeſs Sophia, and
the iſſue of her body, being proteſtants.</p>
               <p>The oppoſition of the Whigs to the invitation to the princeſs Sophia,
having raiſed ſuſpicions againſt their attachment to the houſe of Hanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the party endeavoured to take to themſelves the whole merit of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0950500102:39"/>
ſecurities in ſavour of the ſucceſſion, which had paſſed in the preſent
ſeſſion of parliament. The lord Halifax, one of their number, was ſent
with the acts of regency and naturalization to Hannover; and he carried
along with him letters from all the leaders of the Whigs, expreſſive of
their ſincere attachment to the ſucceſſion of the electoral family. The
increaſe in the correſpondence with Hannover, together with the zeal
expreſſed in the letters, form a kind of proof that the ſucceſſion of
the princeſs Sophia and her poſterity, began then, for the firſt time, to
acquire a degree of certainty. The Queen, perhaps juſtly, was ſuſpected
of having no intentions of that kind; and her miniſter, the lord Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,
had been uniformly in the intereſt of the exiled family, though,
by a happy timidity, he at laſt, in a manner, enſured ſucceſs to their
rivals. He, however, was ſo true to his principles, that, though he
aided, with all the weight of government, the acts of regency and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization,
he never took merit to himſelf from that circumſtance, nor
entered into any correſpondence with the houſe of Hannover. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
events, connected with the correſpondence of this year, are the
complimentary embaſſy of the lord Halifax, the treaty guaranteeing the
proteſtant ſucceſſion concluded with the States General, the treaty of
Union then carrying on between the two kingdoms, the battle of Ramil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
the ſubſequent conqueſt of Flanders, the victory before Turin, and
the evacuation of Italy by the houſe of Bourbon.</p>

                  <p>WHEN I was firſt, by her Majeſty's great goodneſs, raiſed to the
ſtation I am now in, I could not perſuade myſelf, that a ſubject
of ſo little importance, would have then excuſed my preſumption in
troubling your electoral highneſs in this manner upon that occaſion,
though with the ſincereſt aſſurances, that my heart ſhould ever continue
moſt firmly devoted to the ſervice of your E. H. and your E. H. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
houſe. But now, ſince I hope it is allowable for me, to expreſs to
your E. H. the very great ſatisfaction I have with every good Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
received from the effectual ſecurities lately provided by the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the proteſtant ſucceſſion to the crown of England; I beg leave
humbly to preſent to your E. H. at the ſame time, his moſt faithful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of a moſt ardent zeal for your E. H. proſperity, and promiſe
never to neglect any thing in my little power, that may poſſibly conduce
to it; being fully perſuaded, it is impoſſible to be in the true intereſt of
England and not to be a faſt friend to that ſucceſſion, which the ſenſe of
the kingdom hath ſo often declared to be its only defence from the moſt
deplorable condition a people can be reduced to. I was one of thoſe,
who have had the honour, for a long time paſt, conſtantly to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to that opinion, for excluding a Romiſh ſucceſſor, even while it
was unfaſhionable and decried by thoſe that were in authority; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the ſame perſons ſhould now continue firm to the ſame, when
it is owned by the legiſlative authority and the general bent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
can admit, I think, of no queſtion. This I choſe to mention, as an
evidence of my ſincerity in what I profeſs, rather than multiply ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
which are in every one's power to make; not that I am at all
apprehenſive of thoſe endeavours which have been uſed to render your
E. H. and your E. H. ſerene houſe diſguſted, with thoſe who have the
trueſt concern for your ſervice; ſince it is impoſſible, that ſo excellent a
judgment as that of your E. H. ſhould ever prefer the ſurprizing ſtarts of
a ſudden unaccountable zeal, contrary to known principles, affected
merely for popularity, and ſhewing itſelf in one particular only, (while
all other means tending to the ſame are neglected) to a ſteady, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0950500102:46"/>
and uniform courſe of acting for the proteſtant ſucceſſion, and
flowing from principles, that were owned, when moſt diſcountenanced.
But theſe endeavours in me to give your E. H. any ſatisfaction of this
kind, are perfectly unneceſſary, ſince my lord Halifax, who is ſo able and
thoroughly verſed in all the affairs of this kingdom, and ſo acquainted with
the inclinations and practices of all men in buſineſs here, is to be for
ſome time, in your E. H.'s court, where none can ſo well diſperſe all
unfair repreſentations of facts; and when that is done, your E. H. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but make the wiſeſt concluſion, and ſuch as next, under the bleſſing
of God, may beſt tend to make yet more effectual, thoſe prudent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions

thought fitteſt to be made for the intereſt and honour of your E. H.'s ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene

                  <p>"THE hopes of having my letter preſented to your Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
by my lord Halifax, has encouraged me to the preſumption
of writing. I could not hope for a more favourable opportunity of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this humble tender of my duty, than by the hands of one, who has
ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed himſelf, upon all occaſions, for the ſettling and
eſtabliſhing the ſucceſſion of the crown of England, in your moſt ſerene
family, and who will be a witneſs above exception, of my conduct, in
every part of that affair. I confeſs I always depended upon it, that my
public behaviour ſhould be an abundant teſtimony for me, as to my
zeal to the proteſtant ſucceſſion, and for promoting the war, in order to
reduce the power of France, which I take to be the moſt effectual ſecurity
to that ſucceſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is with infinite ſatisfaction we hear your Electoral Highneſs has been
pleaſed to approve the meaſures taken in our parliament this laſt winter.
My lord Halifax is able to give ſo perfect an account of every thing that
has been done, and of the ſeveral means uſed to bring them all to bear,
that I ſhall not pretend to enter further into that matter, than by ſaying,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0950500102:47"/>
I hope it will appear, that nothing is now wanting to the eſtabliſhment
of the ſucceſſion that can be done by the proviſion of laws; and that the
adminiſtration of the government, when the ſucceſſion ſhall take place,
will be upon the ſame foot that it is now in the Queen's reign.</p>
                  <p>It might have a ſtrange appearance, that they, who by a long and
ſteady ſeries of acting, had ſhown themſelves, beyond a poſſibility of
diſpute, the aſſertors of the ſucceſſion, in the perſon of her Electoral
Highneſs, the princeſs Sophia, ſhould in the leaſt heſitate to agree to a
propoſition, that it was neceſſary to have the next preſumptive heir to the
crown to reſide in England; but I beg leave to ſuggeſt to your Electoral
Highneſs's conſideration, that if this had been allowed for a rule, it might
poſſibly, in a little time, have preſſed very inconvenient upon your
Electoral Highneſs. It was not to be imagined you would leave domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
where you were ſovereign, to reſide in England, before you were
our king; and yet there would have been an inconveniency in rejecting
an invitation of that nature, when the kingdom had before declared ſuch
a reſidence to be neceſſary. But the manner of making this propoſal
was, above all other things, the ſtrongeſt objection to it. The ſpeech
with which it was introduced, is in print, and ſo cannot be miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.
The turn of it was to ſhew firſt, that we could go on no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Dutch, (which was in effect to ſay, we muſt make peace)
and next to ſay, the Queen's adminiſtration was hardly ſufficient to help
us in peace, at home, unleſs the next heir came over. The Queen was
preſent at this diſcourſe, and no one can judge ſo well as your E. H.
whether this was a compliment proper to engage her Majeſty, to enter
willingly into the invitation; and if it had been aſſented to with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
whether it might not have given riſe to unkindneſſes, that might
in the end have proved very fatal.</p>
                  <p>They who were afraid of entering into ſuch an invitation, (eſpecially
coming as it did from thoſe, who never till then ſhewed any concern for
the proteſtant ſucceſſion) thought it proper to lay hold of that favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
conjuncture, to puſh in for thoſe ſolid proviſions, which were
evidently wanting, and which we hope are brought to effect, by the act
that is to be farther carried on by the negociation entered into for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
the allies to become guaranties of our ſucceſſion, and by the treaty
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0950500102:48"/>
between the commiſſioners of England and Scotland, for a union of the
two kingdoms, which ſeems to be the way now laid open, for obtaining
the declaration of the ſame ſucceſſion in Scotland, which is already
effected in England. I believe there is a good diſpoſition in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
on both ſides. I can abſolutely promiſe for one, the meaneſt
of them, that as far as my capacity and application can go, nothing ſhall
be wanting to bring this treaty to a happy iſſue.</p>
                  <p>Having already preſumed to take ſo great a liberty, I humbly beg
permiſſion of your E. H. to mention another particular, the act of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization,
which ſome have ſaid was, at leaſt, unneceſſary, if not a
diminution to your moſt ſerene family. If this be ſo, not only all our
preſent judges, but all the lawyers of former ages have been in the wrong.
There are but two ways of making any perſons born out of the allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the crown of England, capable of enjoying inheritances, honours,
or offices in this Kingdom; the one complete and perfect, which is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization,
by act of parliament; the other imperfect, which is by
letters patent, of denization. That this is ſo, cannot be better proved, than
by the inſtance of his highneſs prince Rupert. For when K. C. the Firſt
intended to create him D. of Cumberland, to make him capable of that
title, it was found neceſſary, previouſly to make him a denizen, by the K.'s
grant, under the great ſeal; the differences then ſubſiſting between the
King and his parliament, making it impoſſible to procure a naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But the preſent act is attended with all poſſible marks of honour
and reſpect, for the Queen and nation. It extends to all the poſterity of
her R. H. the princeſs Sophia, born, or hereafter to be born, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they are born, which is a privilege that was never yet granted
in any caſe, till in this inſtance. It is only from your E. H.'s eminent
goodneſs, that I can hope for pardon, for this tedious addreſs. I am,
with the moſt profound reſpect, &amp;c.</p>

the intendant of my finances, that is to ſay, the auditor of the
Exchequer, lord Halifax, has always teſtified for your perſon and your
intereſts; I gave him orders to preſent to you authentic copies of three
acts, which concern your family. The ſhare which he has had in theſe
acts, renders him very fit to explain to you, with what intention they
have been formed; and, I doubt not, but you will agree with me, that
nothing could more effectually ſecure the ſucceſſion of your family. It
is with this view I have given them my aſſent, having nothing in the
world ſo much at heart, as to preſerve our religion and the tranquillity of
my ſubjects, by leaving theſe kingdoms to the mild dominion of my
proteſtant heirs. I have given orders to lord Halifax, to aſſure you,
that, on all occaſions, I conſider your intereſt as my own; and, as a ſmall
proof of my eſteem and affection for your family, I have made my
couſin, the electoral prince, knight of the order of the garter; which is
a dignity, that my anceſtors always conferred upon thoſe whom they
moſt eſteemed, and of which the greateſt princes in Europe are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.
The earneſtneſs of my above-mentioned miniſter to obey my
orders, and his zeal for his country, equally engage him to diſcharge
this commiſſion. I beſeech you to be ſo good, as to honour him with
your confidence, when he enters upon theſe ſubjects; and when he tells

I received, with the utmoſt gratitude, the communication of the deſign

to venter letters to ſo great a perſon that are ſo liable to be intercepted

me reſolve to give your R. H. this one trouble more now at laſt, in
hopes it may have better ſucceſs, though incloſed for once to Mr. Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
but in a private pacquet, who, as devoted as poſſible to the houſe

troops from the fortified places, and collected together all their
forces in the Low Countries, had paſſed the Geete at Tirlemont, and
encamped between that place and Leane, with a deſign of giving us bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
we did not heſitate to advance toward them, placing our confidence
in the bleſſing of heaven and the valour of our troops. Sunday laſt, we
continued our march, at three o'clock in the morning, to gain the opening
between the Mahain and the great Geete. We ſoon underſtood that the
enemy were likewiſe in march; but, according to the report of the
general officers who were our priſoners, their deſign was not to fight
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0950500102:59"/>
before Monday; not believing that we would venture to come to them.
The armies were in fight before noon; and all diligence was uſed on
both ſides to arrange the troops in order of battle, and to form the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
which began to play at one. And toward two o'clock, we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the village of Ramillies, which covered the right of their infantry,
where they had their largeſt battery, with a great force, to be attacked.</p>
                  <p>The battle became hot, and continued long enough, with great
fury; but at laſt, the enemy was obliged to give way. We took their
cannon, and made many priſoners; and having continued the fight with
the ſame vigour, (the infantry as well as the cavalry) until between four
and five o'clock, when the enemy began to withdraw; we purſued them
without intermiſſion, fighting them as they retired, until the night was
far advanced: ſo that God has given us a complete victory. We have
taken forty-three pieces of cannon, the pontons, a great part of their
baggage, and at leaſt four thouſand priſoners, beſides their loſs in the
battle.</p>
                  <p>We only halted two hours in the night, and we began our march
before day, in order to draw near the Dyle, of which we had determined
to attempt the paſſage this morning at day-light: but the enemy ſaved
us that trouble, having retired laſt night toward Bruſſels; ſo that we
entered Louvain, and all our army paſſed the river without oppoſition.
The French burnt their magazines in the town, but the Spaniards left
theirs entire.</p>
                  <p>Your E. H. may eaſily judge, by this, of the loſs of the enemy, and
of the conſternation in which they are. We propoſe, to-morrow, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
toward Bruſſels, to take the advantage of this conſternation; and

                  <p>"I Thought it proper to inform you, by a meſſenger, that the prince
of Baden continues to ſolicit lieutenant general Bulau to march to
his aſſiſtance, with the corps of troops which I have in the Queen's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
He wrote to him from Raſtadt, the 19th inſtant, by Mr. D'Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the moſt preſſing letter imaginable. It is true, I had permitted
the lieutenant general to advance, on that ſide, with my troops, when
there was any hopes of preventing the enemy from executing their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
on the Upper Rhine. But, at preſent, where they have carried their
point, when the Marſhal de Marſin returns to the Maeſe with the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he commands, and when the prince of Baden, having placed
himſelf ſafely beyond the Rhine, has aſſembled there a force ſufficient to
prevent the paſſage of the French, I ſee no neceſſity of ſending to him
my troops. I know, if they once ſhould advance on that ſide, the prince
will find means of keeping them all the campaign, which is as contrary to
my intentions as it is to the public ſervice. I always reckoned that they
were to ſerve in your army; and I don't ſee that there is any neceſſity of
employing them elſewhere. You will therefore oblige me much, by
ſending them your orders without delay. They will follow them punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually.
But I chuſe to hope, that you will approve the ſtrong reaſons
which I have, not to truſt them to the prince of Baden; and that the
intereſt of the common cauſe does not demand that I ſhould. You will find
means of employing my troops in places where they may ſerve more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
I ſhall never think them ſo well as under your orders; and I
ſhall never be ſo well ſatisfied, as when they ſerve in a manner which
will procure them your approbation. I am, very ſincerely, &amp;c."</p>

                  <p>"I Received the letter which your E. H. did me the honour of writing
to me the 26th of the laſt month; and I was informed, from other
quarters, of the earneſt repreſentations which the prince of Baden conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to make to Monſide Bulau, in order to engage him to march to
his aſſiſtance. But there are more than ten days, ſince I ſent poſitive
orders to that general to come, with all ſpeed, to the Low Countries;
which he will undoubtedly communicate to your E. H. I am very glad
to ſee, by this letter, that what I have done in this reſpect, is agreeable
to the wiſhes of your E. H. I expect to learn, every moment, that the
troops are on their march, having ſent to them a route to come from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blentz
to Liege.</p>
                  <p>The prince of Baden ſhould adhere to his orders, ſince, as your F.
H. remarks, he has troops under his command of which he makes no
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0950500102:62"/>
uſe. But as, according to the intelligence which we receive, the court
of France muſt have given orders to Monſieur de Villars to march thirty
battalions and forty ſquadrons to this ſide, the prince will be ſoon at
liberty to act on his ſide: and I ſlatter myſelf that the court of Vienna
will take care, that ſo large a body of troops, Monſieur de Bulau com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
them at forty thouſand men, beſides the Heſſians, ſhall not remain
inactive during the campaign.</p>
                  <p>I did myſelf the honour to communicate to your E. H. on the
25th of the laſt month, the victory which we obtained over the enemy.
We have not failed to purſue our blow; and the happy conſequences
which that has produced, are beyond whatever we could hope. It has
never been heard, that ſo many places of ſtrength, with entire provinces,
ſurrendered in ſo ſhort a time, eſpecially as they were provided with garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and magazines for a good defence. Oudenard, where there were
three battalions, ſurrendered yeſterday. I have ordered Antwerp and
Oftend to be ſummoned, and I expect their anſwers every moment. We
cannot take the proper meaſures, until we are maſters of the firſt place.
I flatter myſelf that all this will have a good effect elſewhere; and that if
our troops upon the Upper Rhine will do their duty properly, the enemy
will be even obliged to bring forces from Italy to their aſſiſtance; which
will give relief to the duke of Savoy and prince Eugene, and may fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the deſigns of the enemy upon Turin. I am, with a moſt profound

                  <p>"AT my return to this place, Monſieur Bothmer gave me your letter
of the 23d July, which gave me a great dale of ſatisfaction. I
did not underſtand, why the nomination was delayed ſo long; and I am
conſident, that it was more proper that it ſhould be diſpatched. I ſhall
not fail to write to the archbiſhop and my lord Keeper, and I do not
imagine, they will make any difficulty of waiting on Monſieur Schutz,
if he is not able to go abroad; but Monſieur Schutz muſt have his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials
enrolled in Chancery, before he is capable of acting; if I am in
England before the inſtruments are delivered, I will be there, if that
ſhall be thought proper; but in my own opinion it is not. When I was
at the camp, I ſpoke to the duke of Marlborough about the title, and he
is very ready to join in that, or any thing that may be agreeable to the
prince. When I come into England, I ſhall not fail to repreſent it to
the Queen. I intended to have gone to England by Oſtend, but the
penſioner writ to have me come this way, to ſatisfy ſome ſcruples that
were raiſed againſt our treaty; all the towns in this province have
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0950500102:74"/>
agreed to it, but Leyden. I have been this morning with Monſieur Van

make any oppoſition longer; if he does, it will not obſtruct above a day

                  <p>"I Found myſelf ſo very deſirous of embracing the opportunity of the
convoy, from the Texel, that I was not able to inform your Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral
Highneſs of the manner in which the province of Holland conſented
to the treaty. I ſend now a copy of it to your Electoral Highneſs, in
order that I may have the honour of receiving ſuch remarks or inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as your Electoral Highneſs will think proper to communicate to
me, on the ſubject. Your Electoral Highneſs will find the guarantee of
the ſucceſſion drawn up nearly in the ſame terms, as I mentioned in my
laſt letter. But their demands, with regard to the barrier, which they
wiſh to have, are ſo extravagant, that I doubt whether they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to, as they have projected them. I repreſented this very amply to
the miniſters in Holland; and it appears to me, that they have made this
propoſal concerning a barrier, altogether like merchants. They know
very well, that their demands are exorbitant; but they hope to obtain
the better bargain, by lowering a great deal of their pretenſions. The
penſionary is ſo convinced of this, that he entreated me to ſend him, in
writing, the objections which I made to them. I will not fail to do ſo.
Although this method of acting is not juſt, for it will greatly retard the
concluſion of the treaty. Several efforts have been made from many
places, for breaking off this negociation. But I hope that we ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
all theſe obſtacles.</p>
                  <p>We have all the reaſon to promiſe ourſelves ſucceſs, in our union
with Scotland. All the letters from that country give us great hopes,
that it will be accepted by their parliament. This treaty has had its
effect in advancing the other; and when the laſt hand is put to the union,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0950500102:75"/>
and there ſhall be no further means of preventing it, certain gentlemen
in Holland, will not ſhow ſo much coldneſs for the treaty of guarantee.</p>
                  <p>I gave an account to the Queen, of the favourable reception which
I met with in Hannover; and her Majeſty is extremely ſatisfied with
the friendſhip and eſteem, which your Electoral Highneſs teſtified for
her. She has commanded me to renew all the aſſurances which I gave to
your Electoral Highneſs, that ſhe will do every thing in her power, for
advancing the intereſts of your Electoral Highneſs, and of your family;
and I believe you will receive, very ſoon, ſome freſh marks of her zeal
for their honour and intereſt, which, as I hope, will be very agreeable to
your Electoral Highneſs."</p>

Highneſs and your family, has been ſo well received; and I ſhall make
it the buſineſs of my life to merit the continuance of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
The patent for the title of the electoral prince, is now diſpatched.
We were a great while looking for titles, that were anciently in the royal
family, for the earldom and the marquiſate; but moſt of the old titles
have been ſince given away, eſpecially to the natural ſons of King Charles;
and at laſt, it was thought beſt, to create him Marquis and Duke of
Cambridge, that if your Royal Highneſs and the Elector pleaſe, the young
prince, when he ſhall be born<note n="*" place="bottom">His lordſhip, it ſeems, was determined, that the unborn child ſhould be a boy.</note> may be called marquis of Cambridge.
The duke of York his ſons were called ſo, when he was nearer in degree
to the crown, and it would certainly pleaſe the Engliſh, if he took that
name. I ſend your Royal Highneſs the articles of the Union, as they
are printed in Scotland. They have been kept very private, till they
were laid before the parliament; by all accounts from thence, there is
great reaſon to hope they will be approved; there has been little done
hitherto, but the appearances are promiſing; the Jacobites there, are ſo
apprehenſive that the Union will be carried, that they are willing to come
into the propoſition which the oppoſing party talk of making, which is,
to ſettle the ſucceſſion on your Royal Highneſs, with limitations, and a
communication of trade; they think this the moſt plauſible way of baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
the union; but it is ſo well underſtood, that this offer comes too
late now, which might willingly have been received ſome months ago.
But your Royal Highneſs will give me leave to obſerve, that we have
managed the opportunities we have had with ſome ſkill, when things are
brought to that paſs, that the very Jacobites are for ſettling the proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0950500102:84"/>
ſucceſſion one way, to avoid eſtabliſhing it more effectually another.
And we have this further to ſay, that, if this Union is made, it will be
the firſt inſtance in hiſtory of this kind; for there never was, at any time
or in any place, an example of two ſovereign kingdoms incorporating
themſelves in ſuch a manner."</p>

which I hope you will give to Monſ. Lubieres; 'tis a pretty
good rate for looking upon two ſalvers, but 'tis no matter. I can now
tell you, very confidently, that the Union will be agreed to in Scotland;
we have letters from thence, of the 14th, which ſay, that the oppoſing
party have made their effort two ways; they would firſt have put off the
conſideration of it for three months, that they might conſult their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents;
but that was carried againſt them, by a great majority: then
they propoſed a general faſt, which would have taken up three weeks,
but that was waved, becauſe the Aſſembly of the kirk had not aſked it;
and when it was moved there, it was rejected, and the aſſembly has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
the miniſters to offer up prayers for the ſucceſs of the union. And
now the clergy have made this ſtep, it cannot fail of ſucceeding. By
letters I have from Holland, I have no doubt of the ſucceſs of our treaty
there, though there will be ſome difficulty in adjuſting their barrier. I
think now, we may be all allowed to boaſt, that nothing was ever better
puſhed, than the eſtabliſhment of our ſucceſſion has been, ſince we had a
parliament to promote it. And if you can but take care of hindering
your northern hero from breaking our meaſures, we will make France
own, both the Electorate and the ſucceſſion of the Houſe of Hannover.

whom France has made no overture; and, as the two letters which you

to ſay, whether there are any princes of the houſe of Auſtria, whether

For, without this precaution, it may happen, that in caſe the Emperor

               <p>THOUGH Great Britain derived the benefits of the Revolution
from the folly and enthuſiaſm of James the Second, it owed the
continuance of that ſyſtem of government to the happy ignorance and
confined policy of Lewis the Fourteenth. The juſtneſs of this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is partly eſtabliſhed by the ſecret negociations of the preſent year.
The Union of the kingdoms had raiſed a reſentment, and even a degree
of fury, among the nobility and gentry, as well as among the vulgar in
Scotland, that threatened the worſt conſequences. They wanted but a
ſhow of ſuccours from France, to take up arms againſt England. Many
of the nobility and chiefs of clans were enthuſiaſtically attached to the
excluded family; and they preſſed, with eagerneſs, for the preſence of
the Pretender in Scotland, were it only with a body of men ſufficient to
protect him againſt the officers of juſtice in the kingdom, till they could
join him with their vaſſals. The French King, though apprized of this
ſtate of affairs in Scotland, either through want of comprehenſion in
himſelf, or the fortunate ignorance of foreign affairs, which always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in the counſels of France, declined to ſend the demanded ſupplies,
and thus diſcouraged a diverſion to the arms of the moſt powerful of the
allies, which, in all likelihood, would have procured the peace which was
ſo neceſſary to his diſtreſſed ſubjects.</p>
               <p>To amuſe, however, the Scots, he reſolved to ſend colonel Hooke
again into their country. The object of this man's expedition was to
induce the malecontents to take arms, without ſubjecting the French
King to any engagements on his ſide. When Hooke arrived in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
he found the malecontents diſtracted among themſelves. The
duke of Hamilton, who had been for many years conſidered as the head
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0950500102:90"/>
of the Jacobites,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">month </seg>January.</label> and was much followed by the Preſbyterians, had loſt
the affection and confidence of both, by his impenetrable conduct in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
The two parties were equally averſe to the Union; and they
aſcribed the misfortune, as they called it, of that meaſure, either to the
timidity or treachery of the duke. In this ſtate of affairs, it was not
likely that, if even France had ſent the aid required, the enemies of the
Union could make any formidable figure in the field. But the court of
St. Germains, who perceived that there was no ſerious intention to favour
their own cauſe, informed their friends in Scotland, that no ſuccours
were to be ſent; and that, therefore, they ought to take care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The chief part of the correſpondence of the preſent year relates
to theſe circumſtances. The ſervants of the Pretender, who had been
unreaſonably ſanguine on many other occaſions, ſeemed to have derived
no hopes, either from Hooke's negociations, or the intrigues of their agents
in England, with the duke of Marlborough and the earl of Godolphin.
They, however, continued their intercourſe with the Jacobites in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
to preſerve them in their principles and hopes, for a more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
conjuncture.</p>

the court of France regarded no further the intereſt of the Pretender,
than only when it was ſubſervient to their own. Lewis the Fourteenth
himſelf ſeems frequently to have been ſincere in his profeſſions to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
family. His miniſters, however, juſtly judging that they could
have only the uncertain gratitude of the perſon whom they ſhould ſerve
for the expence and hazard of an expedition, were extremely backward in
making any effectual efforts for invading Britain. Beſides, it was natural
for them, conſidering their own attachment to monarchy, to ſuppoſe,
that they derived great advantage from having in their hands the perſon
whom they ſuppoſed to have an hereditary right to the Britiſh crown.
The attempts, therefore, which were, from time to time, made for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
this iſland, were rather intended to engage the nation in a civil
war, than to contribute effectually to reſtore the family of Stuart. The
languor and caution of its court increaſed with the misfortunes of France
in the preſent war. Happily for Britain, the court of Verſailles were
moſt inattentive and negligent, when they moſt ſtood in need of ſpirited
efforts, and when the ſtate of theſe kingdoms were moſt expoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
and change. It was, for example, with great caution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy,
as appears from the following letters, that the French miniſtry
yielded to the vehement applications of the court of St. Germains, to
take advantage of the violent diſcontents excited in Scotland, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
year, by the Union between the kingdoms.</p>

with you, is only a ſummons to riſe in arms, reſerving to bring along
with us an ample declaration for pacifying the minds of our people, and
the falſe and malicious ſuggeſtions of our enemies, of which we deſire
they would ſend us a draught; in the mean time, you may aſſure them
of our unalterable reſolution of ſecuring to them their religion, laws,
liberties, and independency.</p>

in Scotland or Ireland, to be publiſhed, except you find them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
diſpoſed to take the field; though our letter to him in Ireland may
be ſent, when it can be ſafely conveyed.</p>
                     <p>7. You are to aſſure each of our friends, in particular, of the true

think ourſelves bound, in honour and intereſt, to reward to the utmoſt

Armſworth [Marlborough], I believe he has ſo much buſineſs of his own

of Mr. Kenſy's [the Tories] relations, that they are not now averſe from
having the concurrence of Mr. Manning [the King of France] in Pleſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's

cauſe ſpeedily to a trial, yet Kenſy [the Tories] and his partners ought
to be managed and kept in good humour. In the mean time, I believe
he is irreconcilable with our chief adverſary Wanly [the Whigs]; and
that you may perhaps make him firm to us; and it is upon a like account
that we may reckon to have friends in Mr. Norly's [Scotland] family,

[Marlborough] told captain Gordon is very true, viz. that Manning
[France] has offered to bring the whole cauſe to arbitration, without any
ſalvo to your couſin's [the King's] intereſt: which being ſo, I hope
there will be no mention made of it on either ſide, but that it will be left

                  <p>I am glad to find that your friend the captain has ſo good an opinion
of Mr. Gurny's [Marlborough's] honeſt intentions to pay the old debt,
when able. As to his ability, there are few people that doubt of it; but
as to his ſincerity, I find there are many who doubt of it.</p>

Kenſy [Tories] and Wanly [Whigs], which may poſſibly break out into

proceed to a trial at law, diſcoveries may be made very advantageous to
your couſin's intereſt, as having been formerly joined in commerce with

loſs, I think, is not very great; for I think he would have ſaid no more
to you than he lately ſaid to captain Gordon, of paying of the old debt;
and than what he hath formerly ſo often ſaid upon that ſubject, without
any effect. But you have no reaſon from thence to think yourſelf an
unprofitable ſervant, in the concerns of your friends, and to take upon
yourſelf the faults and failings of others. However, it will not be amiſs
to receive good words, as often as we can from that merchant; hoping,
that, in time, whatever it may be now, things may ſo fall out, that he
may have a good meaning, joined to good words. The ſame thing is to
be hoped from Mr. Travers [Tunſtal] and his partners Kenſy [Tories],
though theſe two at preſent, I think, have more ſincerity than the former,
in what they ſay, whether it be out of ſpite on one ſide, or out of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

                  <p>I Received at once your letters of the 11th and of the 14th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.
I am always in the hopes, that the King of Sweden will
adhere, in preference to every thing, to the proſecution of the war
againſt the Czar; and that if her Majeſty and the States General proceed
to a recognition of King Staniſlaus, and charge themſelves with the gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee
of the peace of Saxony, without exacting any condition or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the King of Sweden: and that, on the other hand, an end is
put to the affair of the renunciation of prince Charles, and miniſters
are ſent to Hamburgh to regulate there, what is ſtill wanting to the
entire execution of the treaty of Travandahl, there will be no apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of any trouble.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but the journey to the King of Sweden, which is propoſed
to you, will produce very good effects; knowing the great regard which
he has for the Queen, and his very particular eſteem for you. I ſhall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0950500102:106"/>
rejoice at it, for my part, becauſe this journey will procure me the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of ſeeing you again. You will judge better, when you croſs the ſea,
if it will be neceſſary for you to undertake it; and if you can do ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any prejudice to the operations of the campaign. I believe it is
extremely neceſſary that you ſhould give all your attentions to ſecure
Piper and Harmelin. My opinion is, that a penſion of 2000l. ſterling
may be offered to the firſt, and of 1000l. to the ſecond; of which the
firſt year may be paid to them in advance. And that if you do not go to
Saxony, it will, in my opinion, be very proper to give this commiſſion
to Mr. Robinſon, while he is at hand, to execute it; for it will be very
difficult for him to do ſo, if it is delayed until the King of Sweden
marches: beſides that, there is a riſk of being prevented by the new mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
from France, who is come to the court of that prince; and who,
undoubtedly, has very poſitive orders to make conſiderable offers to the
two miniſters in queſtion. I am, my Lord, &amp;c.</p>

himſelf juſtly obnoxious to all the friends of the proteſtant ſucceſſion,
by his letter to the earl of Stamford, printed in England, and animadverted
upon by the parliament. He had lived for ſome time at the court of
Hannover: but when lord Halifax was expected there, in the preceding
year, the Elector ordered Gwyne to retire, for fear of his giving offence
to the Whigs. He, accordingly, went to Hamburgh; and, after having
continued in that city ten months, he wrote to the Elector, requeſting
leave to return to Hannover, and enumerating his own pretended ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices

ſo well pleaſed with his company before, as to permit him again to

The reinforcement is ſo much the more indiſpenſable, that it is certain,

ſerve this campaign, and that there are no more cavalry remaining in
Germany which one can employ. I ſhall be very particularly obliged

                  <p>"ON my arrival at the Hague, I communicated to the grand Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary
all that paſſed at Francfort, and particularly the ſentiments
of your Electoral Highneſs, with regard to the operations on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle;
whence he immediately comprehended the neceſſity of being, in
that caſe, on the defenſive in the Low Countries; and as he was of
opinion, that this propoſal may have a bad effect, by diſcouraging
the gentlemen here, who will believe themſelves too much expoſed
thereby, he adviſed me not to make the propoſal at preſent; ſo that I
have not ſpoke of it to any, but to the count de Wrattiſlow and to
Monſieur de Bothmar, who are inſtructed in the particulars of all that
paſſed, during my ſtay at the Hague. The firſt is to give an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it to your Electoral Highneſs, when he will have the honour
of ſaluting you at Hannover; as Mr. de Bothmar will do by writing.</p>
                  <p>I am ſorry, however, to be obliged to tell you, that I do not find
the minds of people ſo well diſpoſed for the augmentation of their troops,
as in the laſt journey I made to this place: but I continue to do every
thing in my power to incline them to it; and I flatter myſelf, that when
they will reflect maturely upon the great efforts of France, and upon
the new levies which they propoſe to make, they will return to their
former ſentiments, and take ſalutary meaſures, according to the neceſſity
of the conjuncture.</p>
                  <p>I have put every thing on board, and I wait only for the firſt fair wind
to go over to England, from whence I will do myſelf the honour of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

humble acknowledgments, for the kindneſs which you ſhewed me at

               <p>THE attempt made towards an invaſion of Scotland, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the preſent year, ſeems to have been, in a manner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from the French miniſtry, by the repeated and earneſt ſolicitations
of the court of St. Germains. Aſcribing the flattering accounts, received
from Scotland, to the zeal of the Jacobites in France, they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to hazard either their ſhips or their troops upon ſo ſlender a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
The diſcontents, in Scotland, though, perhaps, not magnified
beyond their real bounds, were repreſented as too great to be implicitly
believed. This caution, on the part of France, has been, upon many
occaſions, highly fortunate for Great Britain; but at no period more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
than in the year 1708. Towards the beginning of February,
M. de Chamillart and his brethren in office began to iſſue orders, for an
expedition from Dunkirk. The Pretender, when he perceived, that
ſomething ſerious was intended in his favour, reſolved to acquaint his
friends in Scotland, of the intentions of the court of France, and to give
them directions to prepare themſelves for an inſurrection. The perſon
appointed for this ſervice, was Charles Fleming, brother to the earl of
Wigton. The following were the inſtructions given him upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>

public moneys be kept within the ſhires, as alſo proviſions of all kinds
unſold, and not ſent away; and, that they inquire what proviſions may
be about Edinburgh or Leith, or in any of the ſhires above mentioned;

to renew any correſpondence they have had within the forts and garriſons;
and to ſecure, upon the landing, any places of ſtrength fit for magazines.
All which is to be conſidered, with a ſpecial regard to the keeping of
the ſecret, it being much ſafer that ſeveral things be omitted, which,
might be very uſeful, than that any thing be recommended, which may

Lewis the XlVth never deſigned he ſhould land in Scotland; and that
Fourbin had ſecret orders from his maſter, which he did not communicate.
It is, at leaſt, certain, that there are many circumſtances which ſeem to
juſtify this ſuppoſition; and that, if they had landed the troops, as they
might have done, the greateſt part of the nation would have joined the
ſtandard of the Pretender. Their pretended excuſe for returning, as they
received no ſignal from ſhore, is either a proof of this, or of the happy
ignorance of the French, in every thing regarding Britain, in the only
period in which they could hurt this iſland. The fleet returned to Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,

               <p>THE correſpondence of the houſe of Hannover, during the preſent

the Pretender's attempt to invade Scotland in the month of March, the
battle of Oudenarde on the eleventh of July, the ſurrender of the city of
Liſle on the twenty-third of October, the paſſage of the Scheld and the
raiſing of the ſiege of Bruſſels in November, the ſurrender of the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del

ſerved the campaign, under the dukes of Burgundy and Vendôme.
George Auguſtus, Electoral Prince of Hannover, ſerved, at the ſame
time, under the duke of Marlborough and prince Eugene. Prince
George of Denmark, the huſband of Queen Anne, died on the twenty-eighth
of October, in the preſent year. This abridgment of the facts, to

they were deſerted by the prince whom they called to the throne.
The Pretender was not his own maſter, when he was carried to the coaſt
of Britain, in a French bottom. He had, with tears in his eyes, ſolicited
M. de Fourbir, to land him on the coaſt of North Britain, were it even
with his domeſtics only. But it ſeems, that the French admiral had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſecret orders, not to permit the Pretender to ſlip from his hands,
though it is difficult to ſay what uſe the court of Verſailles could make
of that unfortunate prince, except the making a diverſion, for a few
months, to the Britiſh arms. When the pretended prince returned to
France, he accompanied the duke of Burgundy into Flanders, and ſerved
the campaign. The diſcontented Scots continued their ſolicitations to
the perſon whom they called their King, and he and his ſervants were
equally earneſt with the court of Verſailles, to prepare another expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
into North Britain.</p>
               <p>Lewis, for ſome time, liſtened with attention to the repreſentations of
the Pretender. But a winter uncommonly ſevere, which deſtroyed the
fruits of the earth, added the misfortune of famine to the numerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes
brought on his people by the war. He, therefore, plainly told
the Pretender, that he was ſo far from being in a condition to invade the
territories of his enemies, that he was afraid he could not defend his own.
The diſcontented Scots were ſtrangers to the low ſtate of France; and
they endeavoured, as in the following ſtate of the Highland clans, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Lewis the Fourteenth to ſend aid, by repreſenting their own power.
Nothing in the paper appears to have been exaggerated, though its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

troops in Europe; and they have, on all occaſions, (particularly under
the command of the marquis of Montroſe for King Charles the Firſt,
and the viſcount of Dundee for King James the Seventh) in ſeveral
battles defeated above double their number of old regular troops; and
it is hardly poſſible to ſuſtain their charge, if they be rightly led on;
they being ſuperior both in their arms and manner of fighting to any
other troops.</p>
                  <p>The clans are here mentioned, with five hundred men to a regiment.
It is true, that ſome of them can bring more men to the field, and others

                  <p>The Farquharſons have ſtill been loyal: for Findlay Farquharſon of
Braemar and Inverey was killed carrying the royal banner at the battle
of Pinkie, in the year 1547, againſt the Engliſh. His grand-child,
James Farquharſon of Inverey was, at 70 years of age, kept two years
priſoner at Edinburgh for his loyalty; and was forced to pay a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
fine before he was releaſed. His ſon, colonel William Farquharſon
of Inverey, had ſtill a good regiment for the ſervice of King Charles I.
and II. under the command of the marquiſes of Huntley and Montroſe,
and the earls of Glencairn and Middleton; and being ſtill without pay,
and at his own charges, mortgaged all his eſtate for the ſaid ſervice, worth
about 500<hi>l.</hi> ſterling a-year. Yet his ſon, colonel John Farquharſon of
Inverey, was among the firſt who took arms for King James VII.; and
after all the other Highlanders had given over coming to the field, he
raiſed betwixt eight and nine hundred men, and ſuſtained the ſmall party
of the King's officers a whole campaign, acting offenſively as well as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive;
for which he had ſix pariſhes (belonging to him and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations)

next neighbours. Witneſſes of their laſt ſervices and ſufferings are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
Rattrey, major Holmes, lieutenant colonel Fitzſimons, and ſeveral

                  <p>The number of all the men is 12,000.</p>
                  <p>That which is commonly objected againſt the Highlanders is, that
they do not keep diſcipline, and that they plunder.</p>
                  <p>To which it may be eaſily anſwered, that at all the times the Highlanders
were in the fields, they neither had pay nor proviſions, but what Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſent them from day to day; and each ſoldier being obliged to go
and ſearch for himſelf, it was impoſſible to ſend an officer with each of
them: ſo abuſes could not be prevented; and, were the moſt regular
troops in Europe in the ſame circumſtances, they might be found as ill,
if not worſe, than the Highlanders.</p>
                  <p>Moſt part of all Lowlanders are their inveterate enemies, and ſeldom
or never ſpeak or write favourably of them, and that from mere envy;
becauſe a Highland clan is capable to render the King better ſervice than
ſome of their firſt nobility; and, as to their leſſer, a dozen and more of
them cannot bring ſo many men to the field as one clan.</p>
                  <p>The King might likewiſe expect from the low countries of Scotland,
at leaſt, 20,000 men; for the King hath generally, all the nation over,
three for him, for one againſt him. But ſuppoſing he hath but half,
as certainly he hath more, the militia of Scotland being 22,000 men,
that half has but to double their militia, which they may eaſily do, will
make above 20,000 men. But the King muſt carry arms for them.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Highlanders are generally well armed of themſelves; and,
at moſt, will not want above a fourth part of their arms.</p>
                  <p>The Lowlanders will likewiſe want officers.</p>

                  <p>"THE King of Great Britain has been very ſenſibly chagrined that
his friends in Scotland have been kept ſo long in ſuſpence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a ſecond expedition into that country; but it was impoſſible to
come to any certain determination about it ſooner, although the affair
was preſſed with all poſſible earneſtneſs. At laſt, his Majeſty has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
within a few days, a deciſive anſwer, and he commands me to
communicate it to you from him.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall tell you then, that the project of a ſecond expedition into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
has been propoſed to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, in a very ample
memorial, in which nothing was omitted to engage him to enter into the
ſcheme, and to convince him, that the enterpriſe was as much for his
intereſt as for the intereſt of his Britannic Majeſty. That his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Majeſty has been pleaſed to enter very cordially into the affair when
it was propoſed to him; and that he has taken time to conſider the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and has teſtified a ſincere deſire to make every effort for putting it
in execution: but, after having duly weighed all things, and conſidered
the preſent ſituation of his affairs, his laſt anſwer has been, that, in the
preſent conjuncture, the thing was not practicable, conſidering that it
was abſolutely impoſſible for him, at this time, to furniſh all that was
neceſſary for ſuch an expedition.</p>
                  <p>It is his Britannic Majeſty's deſire that you communicate this to all the
well-affected in Scotland, in order that they may take their meaſures to
preſerve themſelves to a more favourable time. The King did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty but 8000 men, with money, arms,
and ammunition in proportion. But that could neither be granted nor
tranſported, with ſafety, in the preſent ſtate of the affairs of France.
When they are in a better ſituation, I hope the King of Great Britain
will feel the effects of it. But whatever may happen, he is determined
never to diſcontinue his efforts for the recovery of his dominions; and,
I doubt not, but ſoon or late he will ſucceed, although it is not eaſy to
foreſee either the time or the manner. In the mean time, he recommends
to all his loyal ſubjects to take as much care as they can of their own
preſervation. Every one knows the ſtate of his own affairs, and what is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0950500102:137"/>
moſt ſuitable for him to do for his own ſafety in this conjuncture; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in that reſpect, there are no rules to be preſcribed to them. But
his Majeſty always depends upon the continuance of their loyalty; and
he is thoroughly perſuaded, that he will always find them well diſpoſed
to give him proofs of their zeal and affection, every time he ſhall have
occaſion for their aſſiſtance."</p>

                  <p>The States General having informed the courts of Vienna and Great
Britain, that the preſident Rouillè was come to them from France,
with general offers of peace, prince Eugene and the duke of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
were ſent, by their reſpective courts, to the Hague, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of April, 1709. To theſe generals, who were buoyed up with the
hopes of penetrating into France the next campaign, the overtures made
on the part of Lewis XIV. ſeemed not to be ſatisfactory; and the duke
of Marlborough came back to London on the 17th of April. His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
deſign was to acquaint the Queen that the French overtures were
rejected, and that the allies were determined to proſecute the war with the
utmoſt vigour. In the meantime, Rouillè diſpatched a courier to Paris

Torcy, his ſecretary for foreign affairs, with freſh offers to the Hague.
In all the conferences held to ſettle the preliminaries of peace, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

                  <p>Although France is the only country in which his Britannic Majeſty
can find any conſolation, out of his own country, yet, ſince the enemy
inſiſt upon his leaving it, he aſks the King's permiſſion to do ſo, as the
only means of giving him a teſtimony of his gratitude. The eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
ſtate is excluded, for reaſons too evident to be ſpecified; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Swiſs Cantons, becauſe there he would be deprived of the ſociety

ſight of; and he would have no neighbours there but goats, who could
walk out and reſiſt the rigour of the winter. The Spaniſh Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

                  <p>I acknowledge that ſentiments are divided here about the article of the
indemnity. Some ſay that thoſe who are at home will complain, with
juſtice, that they are abandoned to the fury of their enemies; and that
thoſe who are here, will exclaim that they are neglected, that they might
ſubſiſt at home, if they could return in ſafety, and that this court will be
delivered from a number of troubleſome people, who will die of hunger
after our departure. Others think, that a ſecurity for the paſt will render
them uſeleſs for the future; that ſelf-love is a powerful motive for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
the generality of men to perform their duty; that ſeverals may
return from thence full of ill-humour, and in order to be well received,
will become informers, which would produce very bad effects; and alſo,
that this would weaken the Iriſh regiments in the ſervice, many of whom
will be ſeized with the ſickneſs of the Swiſs. It is hoped the King will
be pleaſed to decide upon this diverſity of opinions.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the Queen's dowry, her Majeſty orders me to tell
you, that after her death, and the reſtoration of the King, her ſon, ſhe
gives the million in the town-houſe to his Majeſty, to refund, in part,
ſome ſmall ſhare of his bounty. But above all, his Britannic Majeſty inſiſts
moſt earneſtly not to be named in the article which concerns the Queen;
for, although there ſhould be no expreſs condition, all the world will
ſuppoſe that his honour will be deeply wounded by it. He will be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned

                  <p>"ALL that regards the King of England's intereſt in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
may be reduced to three articles.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the enemy inſiſt that the King of England leaves France, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will be more natural and reaſonable than to aſk them a ſecurity for
him. It is to be wiſhed it may be general. If, however, this meets
with difficulties, let them grant it, at leaſt, in a country that ſuits
them. For there are countries where he will never put his foot, ſuch as
the Pope's territories, and the Swiſs cantons. The Spaniſh Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
appear to be the moſt commodious, from their ſituation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caufe
there will be no occaſion for a ſecurity but from the Dutch, and
from the ſovereign of the country, who muſt oblige himſelf to allow the
King to live at full liberty, with a permiſſion of travelling through all
his dominions, of chooſing the place of his reſidence, and of changing it,
and of leaving his territories and coming back again, without being
obliged to take paſſports, or to give any explanations of the motives of
his journies. A prince cannot be too delicate in ſuch a caſe; and they
cannot, if they act ſincerely, refuſe him the privileges which the law of
nations gives to private perſons in time of peace.</p>
                  <p>It is propoſed likewiſe, that his Majeſty may be pleaſed to ſollicit
earneſtly for an indemnity to all thoſe who have followed the late King
of England, and the King's ſon, as well as for thoſe who find themſelves
expoſed to troubleſome enquiries at home, for having done their duty
ſince the revolution in England. If they make the ſame demand for the
Hugonots, it will be a mere evaſion; for they are deſirous of keeping
them, deſigning, by a general act of naturalization, to draw to them
every one who is not a Roman Catholic.</p>
                  <p>It is not believed that they will make great difficulty about the Queen's
dowry for the future, but about her arrears, although they cannot deny
but they are due for upwards of twenty years. If that cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
we muſt propoſe the time of the peace of Ryſwick, when the
dowry was granted, and when the prince of Orange broke his word;
although he received from his parliament a fund for keeping it, he always
found pretences for doing ſo. There is another term, which is common
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0950500102:140"/>
to all widows, and that is the death of their huſbands, and the right
ceaſes at the death of the Queen. But when the worſt comes to the
worſt, we muſt accept it as they will chooſe to give it. It may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
propoſed, that in caſe they pay the Queen all the arrears, which
amount to a million ſterling, her Majeſty will renounce abſolutely her
dowry, the revenue of that ſum being preciſely 50,000 l. ſterling, at five
per cent. By this means ſeveral embarraſſments will be avoided, her
Majeſty will be aſſured of her revenue, without authorizing any one in
England to receive it, and without diſputing about the form of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges;
for they may exact ſuch as ſhe never will grant, much leſs
will ſhe ſeek redreſs in their courts of juſtice; and to anſwer the chicane,
which was uſed after the peace of Ryſwick, that this money might be
employed againſt them, his Majeſty may oblige himſelf to place the ſum
immediately in the town-houſe of Paris."</p>

but he could make no progreſs in a negociation with the States, until
the duke of Marlborough returned from England. Conferences were
then begun; and in proportion as the French miniſter made conceſſions,
in the name of his ſovereign, the deputies of the States and prince
Eugene and the duke of Marlborough became exorbitant in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.

Townſend, about the intereſts of the King of England. After great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which they imagined to find in obtaining payment of the Queen's dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which they allege is contrary to the laws of England, they confined
themſelves, at laſt, to ſay, that they would deſiſt from their demand of
the King's changing his place of abode; or, if they were obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon his leaving France, that it would be juſt, in that caſe, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence

                           <p>The article of his ſubſiſtence met with greater obſtacles. I propoſed to him the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient of the Queen's dowry.

which you did me the honour to write to me, to-day; upon which
their Majeſties have commanded me, to beg of you to remark three
things:</p>
                  <p>1ſt, With regard to their ſaying, that they cannot pay the Queen's
dowry, as being contrary to the laws of England. In that they are not
ſincere; for, although they have converted the fund to other purpoſes,
there never was any legal deciſion againſt her Majeſty or her pretenſions;
and the parliament, after the peace of Ryſwick, acknowledged them ſo
fully, that they granted, without any difficulty, the whole ſum, which
the prince of Orange received, and detained upon an ill founded chicane.</p>
                  <p>2dly, Their offer to charge themſelves with the maintainance of the
King, my maſter, in caſe he leaves France, is to be ſuſpected; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
one may eaſily perceive, that the malicious deſign of it, is to make
the world believe, that he renounced his pretenſions, on account of this
penſion, and at the ſame time, to have it in their power to reduce him to
the laſt extremity, which his Majeſty will rather endure, than expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be ſuſpected of ſuch meanneſs. I had ſet forth in a memorial all
I now ſay, and explained it more fully in a letter I ſent to M. de Torcy,
the evening before he ſet out.</p>
                  <p>3dly, The King of England is highly pleaſed, that a general ſecurity
is agreed to, in caſe they inſiſt on his changing his place of abode. But it
ought to be conſidered, whether the word of theſe two Engliſh gentlemen
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0950500102:143"/>
may be depended on: for, it would be better to have a written deed,
ſigned by all the confederates, to be inſerted by the mediator, among the
acts of the treaty.</p>
                  <p>I am very unhappy, Sir, to have miſſed the honour of ſeeing you, every
time I have been at Verſailles; and I entreat you to believe me to be,
Sir, &amp;c."</p>

                  <p>"THE firſt ſtep to be made, is to endeavour to perſuade the King
of France, to uſe his intereſt, by his miniſters, at the treaty, to
have leave and ſecurity for a perſon to appear there from the King, only
to give in a memorial in the King's name to the mediator, repreſenting his
juſt pretenſion, and proteſting againſt any thing that may be agreed
upon in the general peace, contrary to the right and title he has to his
crown; which, as it will not hinder the plenipotentiaries to conclude
the peace, as they ſhall agree upon it together, ſo it is hoped they
have no intereſt to refuſe to an injured prince, the ſatisfaction, at leaſt,
of giving this public teſtimony to the world, of his not renouncing his
right, or acquieſcing to any thing that may be done in this treaty to his
prejudice, which is all the benefit required. To facilitate his demand,
it may be repreſented, that the King does not require the perſon he
ſends ſhould be owned as a plenipotentiary in form from the King of
England; but only that he ſhould have ſecurity to go and return, and
not be refuſed acceſs to the mediator, to deliver his meſſage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
from the King and in the King's name, leaving to the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
the liberty, in his anſwer, to give or refuſe the title to the King,
as he ſhall think ſit, only that he be obliged to enter the fact in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toco'e,
that ſuch a meſſage, memorial, or proteſtation was delivered to him,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0950500102:144"/>
ſuch a day, by ſuch a one, in the name of the Pretender to the crown
of England, if he will not directly give the King his title.</p>
                  <p>If this cannot be obtained, at leaſt it may be propoſed, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
be given by one of the French plenipotentiaries, and entered,
as given by him in the name of the King, becauſe he could not have
leave and ſecurity for a miniſter of his own to go and deliver it.</p>
                  <p>If even that be refuſed, there is no other method left, but to ſend the
proteſtation in blank covers, by the poſt, to all the plenipotentiaries, and
publiſhing it in gazettes and otherwiſe, and mentioning, at the ſame time,
that the King aſked a paſſport, for a perſon to go in his name to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
in the formal manner, and was refuſed.</p>
                  <p>As for any thing that may be treated about the Queen's jointure, or
other things relating to the ſecurity of the King's perſon, in caſe of his
memorial from France, if Monſieur de Torcy pleaſes, he can always
obtain a paſs for a private agent of the King's, to attend Mr. Rouillé,
and be at hand to repreſent the King's intereſt to him, and anſwer the
objections the Engliſh may make to him, and furniſh him with memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
and arguments, according as ſhall be concerted with the court of
France; and this perſon being an Englishman, and a perſon of known
truſt, prudence, and integrity, may be of uſe as an interpreter with the
French miniſter, and may alſo, being under the ſecurity of public faith,
be able to inſinuate and diſperſe fit memorials, to move and perſuade the
Engliſh or others, that it is neither theirs nor the public intereſt of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
to exclude the King from his right, and prefer Hannover."</p>

                  <p>"THE King of England believes that it would be neceſſary for his
ſervice, and uſeful to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, to ſend to the
Hague, in the preſent conjuncture, one of his ſubjects who is a man of
abilities and fidelity, who is well inſtructed in his affairs and capable of
carrying on a negociation, who would have a communication with the
French plenipotentiaries, and act in concert with them in all things, for
the common intereſt, and in conformity to the inſtructions with which
he ſhall be intruſted, without giving him any character.</p>
                  <p>This man, having no public character, would not be ſubjected to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
and might inſinuate himſelf and have acceſs every where as a
private man, without being ſuſpected to be of any party; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the language, laws, cuſtoms, and manners of the Engliſh, he
might by frequenting them, diſcover their ſecret ſentiments, and inform
the French plenipotentiaries of many things very uſeful, in the courſe of
the negociation, it being very much the humour of the greateſt part of
the Engliſh, who may be very reſerved with the French, to open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to, and place their confidence willingly in, a countryman, who
will appear to enter into their ſentiments, and have the addreſs, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
their different tempers, to inſinuate himſelf into their favour
prudently and reaſonably.</p>
                  <p>This ſecret agent, by going early to the Hague, before the opening of
the congreſs, will have time to renew the old acquaintances he formerly
had in that country, and to form new ones, to contract intimacies, and
manage intrigues and ſecret cabals, with the public miniſters and other
men of credit of all the different nations, who may meet there in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
conjuncture, and of whom he may contribute to gain over ſome to
the intereſt of France, and to abate the violent oppoſition of others, by
undeceiving them in many wrong impreſſions with which they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed.
He will be able to inform himſelf, thoroughly and at leiſure,
of the different intereſts of the plenipotentiaries, and of their cabals and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0950500102:146"/>
diviſions among themſelves, that he may take the advantage of them;
and, being of the ſame nation, he will have a more particular facility in
diſcovering the inclinations, deſigns, and ſchemes of the Engliſh pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries,
of whatever ſect of religion they are, whoſe creatures they
are, and to what party in England they are attached; and, thus, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ſtrength and their weakneſs, he will be able to give, from time
to time, excellent memorials concerning theſe things to the French ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries.</p>
                  <p>And when the concerns of the King of England are in agitation, he
will be at hand to give informations to the ſaid plenipotentiaries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the intentions and real intereſts of his Britannic Majeſty; and,
when the Engliſh object the difficulties and chicanery of their laws, as
they have done already, without any foundation, in the affair of the
Queen's dowry, he will be able to tell the French plenipotentiaries, with
certainty, what is true or falſe in the allegations of the Engliſh, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their laws, or the facts, which ſhall be conteſted, and to give them
ample explanations, on the ſpot by memorials, which will refute the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canery
of the Engliſh, and hinder them from impoſing ambiguous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
and advancing as truths facts which are notoriouſly falſe.</p>
                  <p>The advantage of ſending this man early to the Hague is evident;
for, in order to negociate with ſucceſs, he muſt be on the ſpot before
they begin to treat in form, in order to acquaint himſelf thoroughly
with the different characters of thoſe with whom he may have to do, to
ſtudy their humours, their public and private intereſts, and to tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with thoſe who have credit with the principal miniſters, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in that manner, to diſcover their ſentiments, and to find means of
gaining them, or at leaſt of appeaſing them, on ſeveral articles, from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of perſonal intereſt, joined to all the other reaſons of juſtice and
equity which can be ſuggeſted to them. Now, all this cannot be done,
but ſlowly and by degrees. Their minds muſt be previouſly diſpoſed,
and their prejudices removed, and a number of emiſſaries muſt be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
in order to be well inſtructed in every thing that happens, and
to be always ready to ſeize every favourable opportunity. He muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
in time, and ſpare nothing to gain over favourites, in order that he
may have free acceſs to their ſuperiors, and find means of inſinuating
himſelf into their confidence, and of diſpoſing them inſenſibly for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0950500102:147"/>
treaty; and, if all theſe intrigues and attentions are not begun,
and even carried ſome length before the congreſs opens, it will be very
difficult to begin them, with any hopes of ſucceſs, during its continuance:
for then all the plenipotentiaries will be ſo occupied, with receiving and
ſending of diſpatches, with attendance on all the public and private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
with receiving and returning viſits, and diſcharging the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
and eſſential duties of their commiſſion, that they will have ſo little
ſpare time as will render acceſs to them very difficult; and as the part
they are to act will be determined by that time, and all or moſt of the
eſſential articles agreed upon, it will be too late then to hope to carry
on a negociation of any importance for the ſervice of France, or for
that of his Britannic Majeſty."</p>

               <p>THE Hannover correſpondence of the preſent year is connected with
the following facts. The lord Somers, who had been raiſed to the
office of preſident of the council, moved for an addreſs to the Queen,
that ſhe would be pleaſed to ſtipulate in the projected treaty, that the
French King ſhould own the title of Queen Anne, and remove the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
out of his dominions. The miniſter, the earl of Godolphin and
the duke of Marlborough, who divided with his lordſhip the power of
government, were not averſe from this motion. They ſeem to have ſecretly
wiſhed his removal, as the ſureſt means of giving him the eventual ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the throne, after his ſiſter's death; as they knew the unſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable
averſion the people had to the receiving a ſovereign from
France.—The Electoral Princeſs, afterwards Queen of Great Britain,
was delivered of a princeſs who was baptized, by the name of Anne, in
compliment to Queen Anne. The King of Sweden was ſtopt, in the
career of his victories, by the total defeat of his army, in the fatal battle
of Pultowa, which was fought on the eighth of July. Tournay ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to the Allies on the thirtieth of the ſame month. The bloody
battle of Blaregnies or Malplaquet was fought, on the eleventh of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember;
and Mons ſurrendered, in the end of October. Theſe are the
tranſactions to which the letters to and from the houſe of Hannover prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
relate.</p>

my return, there was little or nothing done in that affair. I hope that
the addreſs of to-day will ſet on foot again that negociation, and produce
a league, for that effect, between moſt of the high allies. The two
houſes concurred ſo unanimouſly in this addreſs; the Queen received
it with ſo much ſatisfaction, and it has the public approbation to ſuch a

France is humbled, and obliged to admit ſuch terms, that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

the reſident of Holſtein at the Hague, a buſy man who hoped to
derive advantages to himſelf, from appearing eager to furniſh Lewis XIV.
with the means of obtaining that reſtoration of the public tranquillity,
ſo much wanted by his kingdom, found means to obtain leave, in the
end of the year, to make a journey to Paris, to forward that important
buſineſs. Though the propoſals which he brought back to Holland
were not reliſhed by the Dutch, who were entruſted with the negociation
by the reſt of the allies, the French King was permitted, at length, to
ſend plenipotentiaries to treat about a peace. Theſe were the Mareſchal
d'Huxelles, and the Abbé de Polignac. The States appointed Buys and
Vander-Duſſen, their deputies to treat with the commiſſioners of the
French King; and the conferences were opened at Gertruydenberg, on
the nineteenth of March, in the preſent year. The Abbé de Polignac,
whoſe intrigues had almoſt placed the late King James on the throne of
Poland, was inviolably attached to the family of the Stuarts. The Earl
of Middleton, therefore, as ſoon as he underſtood that the Abbé was to
be one of the plenipotentiaries, began to recommend to him the intereſts

deſires him to make what uſe of the memorial his own diſcretion
ſhould dictate to him; but enjoins him ſecrecy, as he had ſent it without
the knowledge of the court of France. He thinks that the excluding
the King of England, and ſo many of his neareſt heirs, from ſucceeding
to the crown, will, for a long time, continue diſſenſions and wars in
Europe, which his reſtoration alone can prevent; and to which he thinks
the neighbouring ſtates, and particularly the Dutch, are, in common
prudence, bound to contribute. He aſks a paſſport for a truſty perſon,
whom his maſter might ſend privately to them, to aſſure them of his
attachment, and to cultivate a good underſtanding with them.</p>

                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0950500102:162"/>
In the memorial, the Pretender ſets forth, that, as he will continue his
efforts for his own reſtoration and the deliverance of his people, a ſolid
peace can never be eſtabliſhed, while ſo many millions of his ſubjects
were well affected to him. A ſtrict union with England was neceſſary
for the United Provinces. His Majeſty was ſincerely diſpoſed to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
a good underſtanding with the States; and, from their great wiſdom
and penetration, he hoped to meet with correſponding ſentiments in
them, and that they would find acts of friendſhip towards a prince who
ſuffers unjuſtly, and never was their enemy, conſiſtent with their own
intereſt, and with the principles of honour and juſtice. England is the
only rival of Holland in commerce, which will often occaſion animoſities,
that will often terminate in open wars. It is the intereſt of the States
to ſecure the friendſhip of the ſovereign of that country. A Catholic
King will be leſs in a condition to carry on a war againſt them, than a
Proteſtant; and if he is but King of England, he can only carry on a
war by ſea; whereas a Proteſtant prince, who has conſiderable territories
on the continent, and in their neighbourhood, can attack them by land,
as well as by ſea.</p>
                  <p>He then recommends two points to their conſideration. He aſks their
good offices at the enſuing treaty of peace, in obtaining a ſecurity for
the payment of the dowry of the Queen his mother; and alſo a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for his own perſon, and for thoſe who will follow him when he
leaves France. He gives the ſame reaſons for theſe demands which are
contained in the memorials preſented to the court of France laſt year.</p>
                  <p>It appears, that Leers wrote ſeveral letters, after receiving this memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,

to which the King is to retire, I am ſurpriſed, Sir, to ſee that Rome
or Avignon is propoſed; and that Cologne or Liege are thought too

laſt year, to Monſieur de Torcy, in ſuch a way, as to make him
conclude, that the King would be under no reſtraint, in chooſing the

as they ſhall give you, in purſuance of their inſtructions from
the King their maſter, in matters relating to our intereſts in the preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations

                  <p>2. That you ſhould endeavour, with all poſſible diſcretion and caution,
to become acquainted with the miniſters of the principal confederated
princes, or ſuch as may influence them, to convince them of the juſtice
of our cauſe, and the intereſt their maſter may have, in not oppoſing, at
leaſt, the general ſecurity which will be neceſſary for us at our retreat
from France.</p>
                  <p>3. That you ſhould labour, in an eſpecial manner, with the Engliſh
and Hollanders, for the Queen our mother's eſtate, of which ſhe has been
ſo violently deprived for above one and twenty years; that it may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0950500102:164"/>
ſettled and paid for the future; and to take care that no form of
acquittances be required, by which her Majeſty may ſeem to own the
preſent government of England. Nine years arrears may be aſked; but
not inſiſted on.</p>
                  <p>4. If the Engliſh propoſe to the French, that they may pay what is
neceſſary for our maintenance in foreign parts, it may be accepted, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the article of agreement be clearly and abſolutely expreſſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

they may have conceived of us; in order to which, beſides the
arguments that occur to yourſelf, you may make uſe of the Scotch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,

Succeſſion of Hannover;" and if any unforeſeen important matter hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
on your repreſentation, you ſhall have our orders concerning it.</p>

lord Drummond, whom he affirms to be ſent by the reſt. How im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
all this is, you may eaſily ſee. However, not to ſeem to
ſuſpect the man, I was very civil to him, and took all he ſaid as argent
comptant, for fear he ſhould think to be diſcovered, and diſappear
before the Queen's anſwer comes, which I ſhall expect before I do any
more in the matter. In the mean time, he ſays, lord Drummond won't
ſtir from Gand, where he now is, till he receives my farther orders.
This man is certainly employed by the government, to betray my friends;
ſo that when he comes to you (for I ſuppoſe the Queen will think that
neceſſary) one cannot have too great an eye over him, till one can, at
leaſt, hear from Scotland, what ground there is for what he affirms.
But I refer to the Queen, to do, in this matter, what ſhe thinks fit.
She has yourſelf and a few others to conſult, and I am here alone, which
is far from eaſy to me, upon many accounts. But neceſſity has no law;
and that alone could have made me not carry you along with me;
though, at preſent, I really begin to believe I ſhall not be long from you;
for the enemies immobility looks very like a truce. I am ſure we want
it, for we have no money, bread but hardly, though hitherto exactly
enough, and our liſt not above half complete. I ſhall ſay nothing of my
health, for you know from the Queen how that goes with me; but am
now at eaſe, that I am well enough to go to the army, if there be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of action. My ſiſter is charmed with your complaiſance in
being her conductor in all her ſorties, and, by what I can find, ſhe is as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0950500102:171"/>
well pleaſed to be at Chaliot, as you are to be out of St. Germains.
'Tis a fine evening, ſo I muſt end, to go and take a walk in a prettier
place, I believe, than you have in your palace at Chaliot, though I hear
it is very magnificent."</p>

                  <p>The proſecution of Sacheverell having deſtroyed the influence of
the Whig-miniſtry with the people, the Earl of Sunderland, the ſon-in-law
of Marlborough, was diſmiſſed from the office of ſecretary of ſtate,
in June. A total change, in the ſervants of the crown, was no longer a
matter of doubt with the nation; though the perſons who compoſed
the adminiſtration, uſed all their art to intimidate the Queen, that they
themſelves might retain their power. The monied intereſt in the city,
in particular the governour and directors of the bank, repreſented the
danger of turning out the lord-treaſurer, and ſuch perſons as he could
truſt. The duke of Marlborough had influence ſufficient with the allies,
to induce them to interfere in the cauſe of his party. The comte de
Galas, ambaſſador for the Emperor and King Charles the Third, together
with Vrybergen, the Dutch ambaſſador, repreſented to the Queen, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of making any change among her ſervants. She however, though
ſhe anſwered them politely, ſeemed determined not to comply with their
demands, except in the article of the duke of Marlborough's continuing
in the command of the army. The duke himſelf, with his uſual addreſs
and coolneſs, affected to acquieſce in the Queen's pleaſure. But he ſeems
to have entered privately into a ſcheme of revenge, by his renewing,
with more warmth, his correſpondence with the court of St. Germains.

                  <p>WHAT you wrote to your nephew, on the 13th of the laſt month,
is of ſo great importance to Mr. Matthews [the King] and
yourſelf, that I think myſelf obliged, for your intereſt and his, to write

ſurpriſed, on the other hand, to ſee that you had a deſign of quitting every
thing, as ſoon as the peace was concluded; for I find that to be the only
means of rendering you uſeleſs to your friends, and your retreat may prove
dangerous likewiſe to yourſelf; you are too large a mark, and too much
expoſed for malice to miſs; and your enemies will never believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſafety, until they have ruined you. They will reduce the army,
and the troops that are allowed to ſtand, will be all compoſed of their
own creatures. All the civil offices and military employments will be
filled by men who are of their party. They will change the officers of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0950500102:174"/>
the revenue, and the credit of theſe new officers, with the influence which
the preachers of their party have over the people, will not fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a new parliament of a very different temper from the preſent: thus
your enemies will have all the power to hurt you, and you know well,
they will not want the inclination.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you, therefore, to reflect well, before you deprive yourſelf
of the means you have in your hands, to ſupport yourſelf and to aſſiſt
your friends.</p>
                  <p>But, as you are loſt, if you quit your employments, I ſee likewiſe, on
the other hand, that it will be very difficult for you to keep yourſelf in
office, as things are now ſituated, fo that your intereſt itſelf declares now
for your honour. You cannot be in ſafety without doing juſtice, nor
preſerve your greatneſs without diſcharging your duty, and the time is
precious to you as well as for us.</p>
                  <p>The advice you give us, in ſending us to the new favourite <hi>(lady)</hi> is
very obliging; but what can we hope from a ſtranger who has no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

upon you, ſince we have now but the ſame intereſt to manage, and you
have the power to put Mr. Matthews [the King] in a condition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
you. Lay aſide then, I beſeech you, your reſolutions of retiring.
Take courage, and without loſing more time, ſend us a perſon in whom
you have an entire confidence; or if you have not ſuch a man with
you, allow us to ſend you one whom we may truſt, in order to concert
meaſures for our common intereſt, which can never be properly done

                  <p>"YOU would have received the incloſed memorial ſooner, if it had
not been neceſſary to ſend it firſt to the King, my maſter, in order
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0950500102:179"/>
to have his approbation, and receive his orders concerning it. Although
we were unwilling to repeat over again former memorials, it was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
judged neceſſary to put you in mind of ſome principal points.
You will find in it again the word Capital; for if you begin with this
project, you will find every thing that is neceſſary to make it ſo. But,
if in preference, you mean to execute every other deſign, and to put off
this as ſuperfluous, I own, before hand, you will find nothing in it.</p>
                  <p>All that is new in this memorial is, the ſtate of England, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
made of the Iriſh troops. As to what regards England, it is a
matter of indifference to you whether the parliament be diſſolved or not;
or whether the high or the low church prevail. You will always find
they are your enemies; and I am very ſorry, Sir, to tell you, that even
our friends will do nothing for you, while you do nothing for them.
They don't believe you are diſpoſed to do any thing; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an actual landing which can cure them of their credulity.
That will contribute to conceal the deſign in that country; but it will be
more difficult to conceal it here, becauſe all converſations at the Thuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,
and in Coffee houſes, run upon this project; and the voice of
the people deſire it, as the only remedy to their calamities.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the demand of the Iriſh troops, I conſider it as granted,
becauſe it cannot be conjectured from what motive it can be refuſed;
ſince, beſides the convincing reaſons of the memorial, the Iriſh making
but half the number of troops which was propoſed, the armies will be
leſs diminiſhed by it, and they will be tranſported with leſs difficulty,
and at leſs expence; and it is eſſential to the ſervice to do every thing
which humanly may ſecure its ſucceſs, ſince thereby we ſhall gain our
cauſe.</p>
                  <p>If the bad news from Spain are confirmed, they ſhould forward this
project, becauſe he will be more preſſed on all ſides, and you will have
no favourable proſpect from any other quarter. In ſhort, it is neceſſary
to determine upon ſomething. Even though this project ſhould be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
a peace is impoſſible; therefore there is no choice. I am, Sir,

                  <p>IN the ſeveral memorials which have been formerly preſented to the
court of France from his Britannic Majeſty, concerning his re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment,
it hath been ſhown, that a well-concerted enterpriſe againſt
Scotland would be the moſt certain means to accompliſh it; and that
that enterpriſe would, at the ſame time, be the moſt efficacious, not to
ſay the ſole means, to break the confederacy of the enemy, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh
France in its former ſuperiority: that all the other means tried
till then, whether by force of arms or by negociations, had produced no
effect: that the enterpriſe againſt Scotland had been tried only once
that it was evident to all the world it would have ſucceeded, if ſeveral
obſtacles had not occurred; and that both friends and enemies acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that, if his Britannic Majeſty had landed then, all Scotland would
have declared for him, the bank of England would have been ſhut up,
and conſequently the government of England overturned, and the league
diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>It hath been ſhown, in theſe memorials, that the changes which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in Scotland ſince that time, were all advantageous to the King;
that the people were irritated more than ever againſt the preſent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
on account of the bad treatment they had received from it: that,
at the ſame time, no one had deſerted the King's party, even after the
bad ſucceſs of that enterpriſe: that no ſecret had been ever kept like this
one; ſince, of ſo great a number, both of the nobility and of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
perſons among the commoners, there was not one who would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
any thing, or accuſe any of thoſe who had been apprehended,
notwithſtanding all the threatenings and all the promiſes of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that witneſſes could never be found to condemn any one of
thoſe who have been apprehended, whatever efforts were made by the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0950500102:181"/>
ſervants of the government for that purpoſe; ſo that there can be no
doubt of the good diſpoſition of the Scots.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the Iriſh, it hath been likewiſe ſhown, in theſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
that their diſpoſition hath been always the ſame with regard to
their lawful ſovereign, founded upon intereſt, liberty, and religion; and
it may be added, that the Catholics, who are at leaſt ſix to one Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
are reduced to ſuch deſpair, by the laſt perſecution of the Engliſh
government, and are more diſpoſed than ever to hazard all, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
every thing, in order to free themſelves from the oppreſſion they ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>It is very true, that in the memorials which have been hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
the ſame aſſurances could not be given of the diſpoſition of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
all that could be ſaid of it, with certainty, was that an inſurrection
in Scotland, in the King's favour, would have thrown the affairs of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
into confuſion. But now, it is very evident, that the ſurpriſing
changes which have for ſome time appeared in the affections of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of England, and which are ſeen to increaſe every day, leave not the
ſmalleſt room to doubt of their being well diſpoſed towards their lawful
ſovereign.</p>
                  <p>Two parties, animated to an extreme againſt one another, evidently
eſtabliſh the right of that prince in their public writings. The high church
maintain, as a principle of their religion, that it is never allowable to
reſiſt their King for any cauſe whatſoever; and that the hereditary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
is a law ſo fundamental, that the parliament itſelf cannot change
it. The low church, to ſhow the high to be enemies to the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
maintain, that the conſequence of the firſt of theſe principles
is, that the government, ſince the Revolution, hath been but a continued
uſurpation, and that the princes who have occupied the throne, have
been but uſurpers; and that the conſequence of the ſecond principle is,
that the Pretender muſt be acknowledged as lawful King. The people,
attentive ſpectators of this diſpute, have no difficulty in concluding that
both the one and the other are in the right; and the princeſs, who is in
poſſeſſion, by taking the high church into her conſidence, and giving
them the beſt employments, ſeems to declare intelligibly enough, what
are her inclinations towards her brother. This far the inviſible hand of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0950500102:182"/>
Providence hath already conducted this affair; employing even its
greateſt enemies to advance it, without their perceiving it.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore very evident, that the preſent ſituation of his Britannic
Majeſty's affairs is more favourable than ever; and that, according to all
appearances, he need only have patience for a little time, as ſeveral of
his Majeſty's friends in that country advice him, and leave Providence to
act, in order to enter into the poſſeſſion of his right, by the means of his
own ſubjects alone.</p>
                  <p>But, however well founded theſe hopes of his Britannic Majeſty from
his own ſubjects may be, he is not the leſs ſenſibly affected with the bad
ſtate of the affairs of France; and this is what induces him to offer now
again to expoſe his perſon in a ſecond attempt in Scotland, in order to
procure to France a peace, of which ſhe has ſo much need, providing
the Iriſh troops are given to him to attend him in the enterprize. This
he judges ſo abſolutely neceſſary for the intereſt of France, as well as his
own, that, without it, he believes it is needleſs to think of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>His Britannic Majeſty would wiſh that he had no occaſion for any
troops for this expedition. But, however well aſſured he may be of the
good will of the greateſt part of Scotland, yet, as all the fortreſſes, as
well as the regular troops of the country, are in the hands of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ready to act by their orders, it is abſolutely neceſſary, for the
ſecurity of his Majeſty's perſon, as well as for the ſucceſs of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
that he ſhould have a ſufficient number of troops with him at
landing, to oppoſe the enemy, until his faithful ſubjects have time to
aſſemble and to join him. The prince of Orange, although he was ſure,
before hand, of all the moſt conſiderable men in England, and even of
the chief officers in the army of the late King of England, as appeared
ſufficiently by the event, judged, however, that it was improper to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the enterprize without being attended with fourteen thouſand
regular troops.</p>
                  <p>In the former memorials, the King of England could never demand
leſs than ſix thouſand men; his ſubjects having always aſked eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men to ſecure the ſucceſs of the expedition. It is true, in lord
Drummond's laſt memorial, three thouſand men only are mentioned.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0950500102:183"/>
But it is likewiſe true, that that nobleman does not deny, but he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
his projects with the Highlanders alone, without the knowledge
of the chief men in the low country, who compoſe the greateſt part of
the nation. Yet his Britannic Majeſty, conſidering how difficult it would
be to tranſport a greater number, has limited his demand to the Iriſh
troops, his own ſubjects; who, at the end of the campaign, will be ſcarce
three thouſand effective men. What abſolutely determines his Majeſty
to aſk the Iriſh is, that they ſpeak the ſame language, and are accuſtomed
to the hardy manner of living of the country; and that, of each Iriſh
regiment, two or three may be formed, by incorporating with them the
new levies of the country: beſides, that it will be impoſſible to keep the
Iriſh in France, after they know that the King is landed in Scotland.</p>
                  <p>But there is likewiſe a reaſon, which his Majeſty thinks he ſhould not
paſs over in ſilence, and which appears to him to be very eſſential;
namely, that the allies will no ſooner ſee the landing ſucceed, than, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the conſequences with which it muſt be infallibly attended to their
diſadvantage, they will make fraudulent propoſals of peace to France,
in order to ward off the blow. One of theſe propoſals will be, to deſire
the moſt Chriſtian King to withdraw the troops who may have followed
that prince; and, as his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty will not chooſe to do ſo,
he will have a very juſtiſiable excuſe, in ſaying, that they are not his
ſubjects, but the ſubjects of the King of England, which he could not
ſay if they were native Frenchmen.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the tranſport of troops and other neceſſaries, in which
the greateſt difficulty conſiſts, thoſe who have experience in maritime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
are the beſt, or rather the only judges of that affair. What is very
certain and neceſſary to be remarked here, is, that, unleſs this enterpriſe
is conſidered as a capital object to the ſtate, difficulties will occur on all
hands to diſcourage, and imaginary dangers, which will become real
when things are done by halves: ſo that, to attempt it, in any other
view, will be uſeleſs to France and hurtful to the King of England. But,
if his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty will find this expedition of importance
enough to conſider it as a capital object; in that caſe, money, arms, and
ammunition, as well as ſhips and troops, will be found without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty;
and he will likewiſe find ſea-officers, who will undertake it, and
who, with God's aſſiſtance, will accompliſh it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0950500102:184"/>
The port of Dunkirk has its advantages for the embarkation, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the neighbourhood of the troops and the ſhortneſs of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
But the ſecret can never be kept: for every thing that is done
there is known the next day at Oſtend; and when once the Engliſh and
the Dutch have diſcovered the deſign, they will be always in a condition
to thwart it.</p>
                  <p>It appears then, that Breſt would be more ſuitable, becauſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
could not eaſily hinder the veſſels from ſailing from that port, as was
ſeen by experience, during the war in Ireland. In caſe the preference
is given to that port, the Iriſh troops ſhould be put into winter-quarters
in the neighbouring provinces.</p>
                  <p>It might be likewiſe examined, whether Portpaſſage, near Fontara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,
was ſit for embarkation. In that caſe, the Iriſh regiments might be
ſent to that quarter, as if they were to go to ſerve in Spain; and his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic
Majeſty might repair thither, under the ſame pretext, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
at a diſtance from his kingdoms would conceal the deſign.</p>
                  <p>In the caſe the troops embark at Breſt or at Portpaſſage, they may
land anywhere on the weſt coaſt of Scotland, from Kirkcudbright to the
mouth of the river Clyde. It is true, there is no fortified harbour there,
nor in any other part of Scotland, which would render the landing more
eaſy. But, at the ſame time, the ſhips could not remain there afterwards,
in ſafety, in caſe they were purſued by a ſuperior force.</p>
                  <p>With regard to pilots, they might be had from that country, though
not without giving ſome ſuſpicion of the deſign. But, as ſhips from
Glaſgow, Air, and Kirkcudbright, come ordinarily towards the month of
November, to Nantz and Bourdeaux, ſailors to ſerve as pilots might be
taken out of them, on different pretences. Beſides that, ſome might be
found among the French privateers, who cruize frequently on that coaſt;
as five or ſix of theſe privateers, not long ago, made a deſcent in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
near Air, from whence they carried away ſome cattle and alarmed
the country. It may be known from them, where they got their pilots,
and their method may be followed.</p>
                  <p>The ſquadron, ſailing from Breſt or from Portpaſſage, may ſteer their
courſe through St. George's channel, or round the weſt of Ireland: the
firſt is the ſhorteſt courſe; but is eſteemed the moſt dangerous. Yet the
Engliſh merchant-ſhips daily paſs through that channel, at all ſeaſons.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0950500102:185"/>
In failing along the coaſt of Ireland, ſome Iriſh officers may be landed,
with arms, &amp;c. in order to put the inhabitants in a condition to riſe.</p>
                  <p>But, without entering into a more ample detail of the meaſures which
ſhould be taken to ſecure the ſucceſs of the expedition; and referring, for
that purpoſe, to former memorials, we ſhall only repeat, in concluding,
that the ſucceſs will entirely depend on the manner in which the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
is conſidered, as of greater or leſs importance to France. It is the
buſineſs of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to judge of this, by his conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
prudence, and to determine according to the intereſt of his own
affairs."</p>

                  <p>The following anecdote deſerves credit, from collateral proofs. There
is no doubt but Marlborough and Godolphin had talked about a ſcheme

                     <p>"LORD Godolphin had certainly the beſt head and capacity for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of ſtate of any man in England; and was a man that no
country in the world might be aſhamed of. He had not the leaſt tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of avarice, and was the uncorrupteſt man in his time, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the treaſury and diſcharge of his offices. He was lord
chamberlain to King James's Queen, who had always (as Mr. Dillon told
me, April, 22d 1724) a very great opinion of him; and Mr. Dillon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
he really intended to ſerve the King. He has ſent many of his
letters to that Queen; and the letters are ſtill in being.</p>
                     <p>One reaſon, perhaps, why he did not execute what he projected, was
his cowardice. Nobody could have more of that temper of mind; and
he was ſo ſuſceptible of fear, that the Whigs could bully and frighten
him into any thing.</p>
                     <p>This has made me remember what the E. of A., who was very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
with him, told me, in 1716, viz. That lord Godolphin was the
trueſt and ſincereſt friend to the King, that he ever had; and that, after
his diſgrace, on Dr. Sacheverel's trial, about a month after he was turned
out, making him a viſit, lord Godolphin expreſſed his concern at his
being turned out, before he had reſtored the King: that he had been in
unhappy circumſtances and diſtreſſed by the Tories: that all his miniſtry
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0950500102:186"/>
had been ſpent in a ſtruggle with the junto, whoſe hands the Tories had
forced him into; but that he ſaw himſelf at laſt maſter over them, when
he was turned out on occaſion of the trial, which he was noways concerned
at but on the King's account. That, however, he was of opinion, lord Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
would reſtore him; but he would make France neceſſary to it, which
himſelf would not have done; for he would have reſtored him alone, and
made the French know how poorly they had treated him, and how little
they deſerved at his hands; and the E. of A. believed him."</p>

was going away, to ſee if Pitts would call for them. What! ſays he, Mr.
Booth writes, you have ſomething for me; ſo the trumpet gave them to
him. The trumpet being an Iriſhman, Pitts did not ſpeak one word to
him; but in the morning he called a trumpet of the guard-de-corps
into his chamber, and ſhewed the medals to him, and bid him tell me,
he would give the medals back when he ſaw me, but never before. The
French trumpet came to me before the Iriſhman came home, and aſked
me what thoſe medals were; for that above thirty Engliſh officers ſpoke
to him to bring them medals. The fellow told them what was true, he
did not know what they meant. When you come back, go to the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier

tranſlation of groom of the bedchamber) to ſend us ſome medals, for he
has ſent many here, and he will give you more. The trumpet told me,
lord Churchill enquired very particularly how the Chevalier de St. George
did, and what was the matter with him.</p>
                  <p>When the Iriſh trumpet came home, he brought me ſeveral letters, all
directed for me with his Highneſs the prince of Wales. Pitts ſaid in his,
your coin does not go in this army, but it being fine, I ſhall keep it

wonder they that fight for the Goſpel, ſhould not make that coin current,

and abettors of an arbitrary power in the crown. The Tories
charged the Whigs with being antimonarchical and republican. But if
one was to form his judgement of their principles from their own profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
it would be difficult to diſtinguiſh them, for both parties courted
popularity by the ſame arts, and publickly profeſſed to eſpouſe the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
in the proteſtant line. It will be ſeen by the correſpondence
of this year, that each, as ſoon as they came into place, were equally
ready to make their court to the preſumptive heirs of the crown.</p>
               <p>To defend Queen Anne from being charged with inconſtancy, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or ingratitude, for removing and diſgracing men, who had ſerved
her long and faithfully, doctor Swift inſinuates, that the Marlborough
family had loſt all favour with her Majeſty, upon her acceſſion to the throne,
though ſhe poſſeſſed the art of diſguiſing her paſſions ſo perfectly, as to
have been able to conceal, for a long time, the averſion ſhe had conceived
for them. It is not probable, that her averſion began ſo early; and, tho'
it is not eaſy to gueſs when ſhe began to be ſenſible of the haughty and
imperious behaviour of the party which governed her and the nation, it is
certain, that nothing contributed more to alienate her affections totally
from them, than their conduct and ſpeeches in the courſe of doctor
Sacheverel's trial. Godolphin began the proſecution more from private
reſentment, than ſtate neceſſity, and imprudently furniſhed his enemies
with an opportunity of ruining him and his friends, when he unwarily
gave importance to a man and a cauſe, which he ſhould have treated with
neglect and contempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0950500102:191"/>
The Queen was preſent at the trial, and liſtened with great attention
to the debates, in which a ſpirit of oppoſition betrayed both parties to
advance principles, which probably neither of them would follow to their
utmoſt extent. The Tories openly maintained the doctrine of heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
right and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance; and the Whigs, in juſtifying the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
aſſerted a nation's right to depoſe and dethrone their ſovereign,
and laid down maxims of government more favourable to the privileges
of parliament and the liberties of the people, than monarchs chooſe to
adopt.</p>
               <p>The Tories had not ſtrength to prevent Sacheverel from being found
guilty of all the articles for which he was impeached by the commons;
but they had influence afterwards to procure addreſſes to the Queen from
all parts of the nation, avowing the very principles for which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
Theſe addreſſes aſſerted the doctrines of paſſive obedience and
non-reſiſtance, and acknowledged the abſolute power of the crown.
They condemned, as antimonarchical and republican, all doctrines which
allowed ſubjects to reſiſt their ſovereigns in any inſtance, and declared
the defenders of theſe doctrines to be advocates of blaſphemy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety:
they affirmed that the Queen acceded to the throne by a heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
and not by a precarious parliamentary right or election: they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
a diſſolution of the preſent parliament, and contained aſſurances
that none ſhould be choſen in a new election, but ſuch as ſhould be loyal
to the ſovereign and zealous for the church.</p>
               <p>Theſe addreſſes could not fail to be more agreeable to Anne, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and a ſovereign, than thoſe preſented by the Whigs in a different,
though dutiful and reſpectful ſtrain. In conſequence of the firſt, ſhe
determined to emancipate herſelf, and to change her miniſtry, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the ſucceſs with which they had ſerved her, and an interpoſition
in their favour by the miniſters of the Emperor and of the States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general,
who were directed to repreſent to her Majeſty what bad influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
a change might have on affairs abroad.</p>
               <p>This change furniſhes a new ſet of correſpondents in the courſe
of this year, when the following perſons came into office. The duke
of Shrewſbury was made lord chamberlain on the 13th of April, in
the room of the marquis of Kent, who was gratified with a duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Dartmouth was made ſecretary of ſtate in the room of the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0950500102:192"/>
earl of Sunderland, who was turned out, the 14th of June. The earl
of Godolphin was diſmiſſed the 8th of Auguſt, and in his room, earl
Powlet, Robert Harley, Henry Paget, Sir Thomas Manſel, and Robert
Benſon, were appointed commiſſioners of the treaſury. Though Powlet
was the firſt commiſſioner in form, it was well known, that Harley, who
was made chancellor and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaſurer of the exchequer, had the chief
management of the treaſury, and preſided in every thing, behind the
curtain.</p>
               <p>Mr. James Creſſet, who had been formerly envoy extraordinary at the
courts of Zell and Hannover, was choſen by the new miniſtry to carry
aſſurances of their attachment to the preſumptive heirs of the crown;
and upon his death, which happened ſoon after his nomination, the earl
of Rivers was ſent to Hannover, in the month of Auguſt, with the ſame
commiſſion. He was authorized to aſſure the princeſs Sophia and her
ſon the Elector, that the late changes, for which the Queen had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reaſons, were rather favourable to them, and a further ſecurity for
their ſucceſſion to the crown.</p>
               <p>On the 21ſt of September the Queen iſſued a proclamation to diſſolve
the parliament. The earl of Rocheſter was made lord preſident of the
council, in the room of lord Somers. The lord chamberlain's ſtaff was
taken from the duke of Devonſhire, and given to the duke of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.
Mr. Boyle was diſmiſſed from the poſt of ſecretary of ſtate, and
the ſeals were given to Mr. Henry St. John. The great ſeal, upon the
reſignation of the lord chancellor Cowper, was given to Sir Simon Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court;
and the lord lieutenancy of Ireland to the duke of Ormond, upon
the reſignation of the earl of Wharton. The earl of Portmore was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
commander in chief of her Majeſty's forces in Portugal, and the
duke of Hamilton lord lieutenant of the county palatine of Lancaſter.</p>
               <p>Harley did not make ſuch an entire change as the Tories expected.
But the numbers who were turned out of office now, and on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſoon after, ſufficiently prove, that the Whigs had as carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the Tories from all places of honour and profit, as the Tories
would have now excluded the Whigs in their turn. The military ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
mentioned in the correſpondence of this year, are the taking of
Douay on the 26th of June, of Bethune the 29th Auguſt, of St. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
the 30th September, and of Aire the 9th November. The baron
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0950500102:193"/>

                  <p>"IT is with joy I preſume, once more, with the moſt profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
imaginable, to addreſs myſelf to your Electoral Highneſs;
and to tell you that her Majeſty begins to reign, and that the oligarchy
which tyrannized and threatened ſo long the Queen and the Britiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
begins to vaniſh in this kingdom; where a little cabal made obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
the duty of the ſovereign, and dominion the prerogative of two or
three ſubjects for ſome years." He then tells him, that her Majeſty has
placed herſelf on the throne and at the head of her treaſury. That ſhe
has ſent bills of exchange to Holland, for paying her troops in Flanders
and Portugal; "and ſhe has made ſufficient proviſion for their payment
for the next ſix months, notwithſtanding the tricks and chicane of the
lord Godolphin and his party."</p>
                  <p>"The nation in general adores her Majeſty, and commends extremely
the conduct of the new miniſtry; who had the courage and loyalty ſo
ſeaſonably to preſerve the Queen and the monarchy. It is very certain,
that four years ago, the Queen thought of diſmiſſing her treaſurer and
her general. But the corruption of the two laſt parliaments always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
her." By Mr. Harley's good offices, he ſays, the Queen received
the duke of Shrewſbury into her confidence, as well as Mr. Harley him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
"who was always very loyal and active, and religiouſly devoted to
the intereſts of her Majeſty and the proteſtant ſucceſſion, in the illuſtrious
family of your Electoral Highneſs."</p>
                  <p>"The Queen cannot avoid ſuſpecting all thoſe, who have a familiar
correſpondence with her general, who had already ſet himſelf up as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector;
and his creatures had the inſolence, as well as the impudence,
during all the laſt winter, to drink to his health under that ſine title."
He tells him, that the general and treaſurer, afraid of contributing to the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0950500102:205"/>
advantage of his Electoral Highneſs, and of reſtoring to the Queen the
liberty, of which ſhe had been ſo long deprived, were induced to intrigue
with their party in the houſe of commons, to take notice of ſome impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
expreſſions of the ſpeaker; and, by that means to embarraſs her
Majeſty's affairs, and prevent their own fall. When Shrewſbury, he
ſays, was put in poſſeſſion of his office, without the knowledge of the
treaſurer or the general, his ducheſs, with her uſual inſolence, began to
quarrel with her Majeſty. But her Majeſty, wearied of hearing ſo much
abuſe from ſuch a peeviſh woman, forbad her to appear in her preſence;
ſince which time, her Majeſty has been allowed to tranſact buſineſs in
peace.</p>
                  <p>"At length the earl of Rivers is gone to fulfil the office which Mr.
Creſſet<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Creſſet had been ſent in capacity of envoy from her Majeſty to his Electoral Highneſs.</note> had to execute. An individual ſhould never pretend to know
what the commiſſions of his ſovereign contain, with regard to affairs of
ſtate; of which, it is certain, the public is entirely ignorant. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,
and the public miniſters of the foreign potentates, who were always
cloſely connected with lord Godolphin, and who were almoſt all ſeduced,
or rather charmed and bewitched by him, for very ſtrong reaſons, no
doubt, give out in their public walks and converſation, that lord Rivers
is ſent by her Majeſty to offer the command of the army to your Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral
Highneſs; at leaſt, to come over to this country and pay a viſit to
her Majeſty, &amp;c. What! ſay they, will a great ſovereign prince, as
the Elector of Brunſwick, leave his own dominions and viſit the Queen?
or will he chuſe to command an army after a general who has triumphed
ſo often, gained ſo many battles, and taken ſo many towns? Theſe
wicked men have, for a long time, expoſed your Electoral Highneſs in
this manner." He tells his Electoral Highneſs that Charles V. viſited
Henry VIII. and that King William viſited the duke of Zell and his
Electoral Highneſs. That, ſince her Majeſty has thought proper to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
her general, he aſks, "if there is any one ſo proper to command
the armies of the Queen and the Britiſh nation, as the proteſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor?
in which proteſtant ſucceſſor her Majeſty and her people place
all their hopes," &amp;c.</p>

                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0950500102:206"/>
He proſeſſes his attachment to the Electoral family, and entreats his
Electoral Highneſs to accept of the command of the army. He exclaims
againſt the meaſures of the late miniſtry; and ſays, that her Majeſty had
juſt reaſon to be offended with them: and he concludes, with praying
"God to preſerve the perſon of your Electoral Highneſs, with your illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious
family."</p>

from the new party, (in which he is deeply engaged). I anſwered, that
I did not believe the Whigs gave you any ſuch advantages; that, if
it had been ſo, I would have perceived ſomething of it, and that you
had a maſter, who was alone capable of rewarding your ſervices. "I beg
of you," ſays I, "explain to me a little what you mean, that I may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
you the better." He ſaid to me, "what is expected from Monſieur
de Robethon is, that he ſhould act in concert with the new party in
favour of the family of Hannover." This appeared to me, to have been
ſuggeſted to him, by Mr. St. John, the new ſecretary of ſtate, with
whom I find he is ſo much connected, that I have little doubt, but he
will be ſent back to Switzerland. I replied, that you would always do
your beſt, to ſupport the intereſt of the Elector, and to ſhew, that the
new party was well thought of at your court. I went to my cloſet
for your oſtenſible letter, which I read to him all from the beginning,
without giving him a copy of it. This made an impreſſion, and I doubt
not, but Mr. St. John was regaled that very evening, with what he had
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0950500102:216"/>
retained of it. This is the ſubſtance of our converſation. Perhaps
Monſieur de Hervart informed you of all this in the letter which he
wrote you. He told me, that he had likewiſe ſeen your couſin. They
do not chooſe to diſoblige you, as you ſee. He aſſured me, that my
lord Rivers was very well ſatisfied with you; and what is more, for your
court, although the public concludes the contrary, from his returning
without a preſent. The baron de Bothmar is expected every day. I wiſh
he was already arrived. I foreſee, that both ſides will pay court to
him, and that he will have occaſion for all his prudence, &amp;c."</p>

But it is not poſſible for the Whigs to abandon the Revolution. They
advanced the late King to the throne, and they are obliged to defend
his title. Now, they advanced him then in preference to the Queen who
now reigns, although ſhe was nearer, and a proteſtant. As this could
not be done but by the authority of the parliament, it is natural for the
Whigs to defend that authority, and the parliamentary right to the
crown; for otherwiſe, they would declare themſelves traitors and rebels.
And as the eſtabliſhment of the Hannoverian ſucceſſion is a conſequence
of the Revolution, and a work of the late King, your court ſhould take it
well of the Whigs, that they defend the Revolution, and ſhould excuſe ſome
expreſſions in their laſt writings, which appear to carry too far the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the parliament in the affair of the ſucceſſion; and the more ſo,
that the maxims of the Tories tending directly to prepare the way for the
prince of Wales, and to ſecure his title from being called in queſtion;
it is natural for the friends of the Hannoverian ſucceſſion, to maintain a
contrary doctrine. The baron de Bothmar is expected impatiently, in
order that they may explain themſelves to him more fully upon this
ſubject."</p>

convocation of the clergy, cannot do any thing but by commiſſion from

                  <p>"SINCE the Revolution, there has not been ſo great a confuſion of
counſels and of meaſures in England, as there has been ſince the laſt
change in the miniſtry; and the affair of Greenſhields, a miniſter of the
church of England, whom the parliament has lately protected againſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0950500102:226"/>
the preſbyterians of Scotland, has irritated the latter to ſuch a degree,
that they would concur in whatever might deliver them from the Union
with England, which is univerſally deteſted in Scotland; where they are
all perſuaded, that nothing can deliver them from it, but the return of
their ſovereign.</p>
                  <p>There is, at preſent, a concurrence of circumſtances, more favourable
for an enterpriſe than there has been ſince his Majeſty came out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
But all this will change in time; and for the future, they will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
only to the means of ſupporting, as eaſily as they can, the chains,
from which they ſee no further hopes of being delivered.</p>
                  <p>There is not a man in Great Britain, who is not convinced, that, if
the King of England had landed the laſt time in Scotland, he would have
infallibly ſucceeded; and the conjuncture appears, at preſent, ſtill more
favourable than it was then. The inclination of the Scots towards their
King appears viſible, in their ſending, as members to parliament, the
ſame men who had been brought priſoners to London on account of the
invaſion; and I can aſſure, that theſe men have not changed their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The preſbyterians in Scotland oppoſed the elections as much as
they could, and their miniſters preached againſt them; but in vain; for
theſe members were choſen in ſpite of them, by a great majority of
voices.</p>
                  <p>At the time of the laſt expedition to Scotland, men ran in crowds,
and with ſo great eagerneſs, to withdraw their ſtock out of the Bank, that
the commons were obliged to paſs a law declaring all thoſe to be enemies
to the government and to the nation, who ſhould demand their money
from the Bank, at that time; but, inſtead of curing the evil thereby,
they increaſed the diſcontent; every one exclaiming, that it was cruel to
treat, as enemies to the ſtate, thoſe who called for their money when they
had occaſion for it; and, if news had not come, that the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
had returned to France with the fleet, in twelve hours later the Bank
would have been ſhut up. This is well known to all thoſe who were
then in London, and is known throughout all England, inſomuch, that,
ſince that time, the credit of the Bank is greatly diminiſhed. Not long
ago, the news of the failing of 13 or 14 privateers from Dunkirk gave
the alarm in England, that the Pretender was coming; upon which, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verals,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0950500102:227"/>
with ſome of whom I am acquainted, ran immediately to the Bank
to demand their money; and there is no doubt, but the ſame thing will
happen univerſally, whenever there is a real invaſion. All the funds
will fail: no tax will be paid, but what is raiſed by force: no one will
choo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to advance money upon the ſecurity of the funds; and without it,
it will be impoſſible to make new preparations for oppoſing the invaſion.</p>
                  <p>If the Bank of England fails, I believe there is no doubt, that the
Confederates will not be able to ſupport the war, and then his moſt
Chriſtian Majeſty will have a ſafe game to play, without running any
riſk. Troops are daily draughted, to be ſent out of the kingdom; ſo
that few will be left to make oppoſition, and there are ſeverals in the
army who have diſcovered their diſpoſitions of returning to their duty
towards their King, if they found the opportunity.</p>
                  <p>They are preparing fleets to be ſent to the Mediterranean and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
ſo that the few ſhips, which will remain to guard the channel,
cannot hinder the paſſage from Breſt to Kirkcudbright; eſpecially, if an
alarm is given from Dunkirk and other ports. All the fleet of England
can never hinder a ſquadron to paſs from Breſt to Ireland; and Scotland
is only a little more diſtant in the ſame line.</p>
                  <p>Severals in England wiſh the King well, who would not hazard their
eſtates for him; but theſe very people would not willingly hazard any
thing againſt him, if they ſaw the ſmalleſt riſk on the ſide of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
It ſeems, therefore, that the greateſt number want only an
opportunity of declaring themſelves; that is to ſay, the return of his
Britannic Majeſty, with a force ſufficient to protect thoſe who would
chooſe to join him on his arrival. If he came with 10,000 men, it is
thought there would not be a ſword drawn againſt him.; but if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have that number, 5000 men would render the ſucceſs probable,
but not ſo certain.</p>
                  <p>It is generally thought, that the princeſs of Denmark is favourably
inclined towards the King her brother; and that ſhe would chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have him for her ſucceſſor, than the prince of Hannover. But
ſhe is timid, and does not know to whom ſhe can give her confidence.
The duke of Leeds told me, that he had endeavoured to ſound her as
much as he could, upon this ſubject, and he is in her confidence, and has
free acceſs to her; but though ſhe never choſe to explain herſelf upon
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0950500102:228"/>
this point, ſhe ſays nothing againſt him. It is thought, that if the King
of England was in Scotland, a treaty with him would be immediately
propoſed, and then the members of parliament would be at liberty to
declare their ſentiments; whereas, they are now reſtrained by an act
of parliament, which declares all thoſe guilty of high treaſon, who ſhall
oppoſe the Hannoverian ſucceſſion, by word or by writing. But the
King of England being in Scotland, and all the kingdom acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, which could not fail to happen ſoon after his arrival in that
country, then the preſent ncceſſity, and the common good of the nation,
would authoriſe the liberty, which each might take, of propoſing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
could prevent the fatal effects of a civil war. I am well aſſured,
that ſome members of parliament would ſpeak boldly in that caſe; and
I have alſo reaſon to believe, that there are ſeveral others, who only want
a ſimilar conjuncture for declaring themſelves, and who would do it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially:
and there is ſcarcely any doubt, but the greateſt number would
be for a treaty. Thoſe who would oppoſe it, would not render themſelves
popular, and might be conſidered as the enemies of the peace and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the nation; and the very rumour of the treaty, would make the
people conſider the King as already in poſſeſſion, and as the riſing ſun.
I believe there is no example in our hiſtory, that the lawful heir has been
admitted to a treaty, when his right was not acknowledged; as in the
caſe of Stephen and Henry II.; of Richard duke of York, and of Henry
VI. &amp;c.: and the princeſs of Denmark having no children, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the affair ſtill more eaſy, both with regard to herſelf and with regard
to the people.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-duke had none of theſe motives to encourage his enterpriſe,
and was not aſſured of having one miquilite for him, when he undertook
to make that diverſion in Spain, which has continued for ſo many years,
and is not yet finiſhed. The diverſion of the malecontents in Hungary
has been of conſiderable advantage to France; and it was by marching
into Saxony, that the King of Sweden obliged King Auguſtus to ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>The ſmalleſt advantage which an expedition of the King of England
into Scotland could produce, would be a civil war; which might be
ſupported from time to time by France, even though none of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
ſubjects ſhould join him: but that is not to be ſuppoſed: for in the
diviſions of parties, there are now malecontents enough in Great Britain,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0950500102:229"/>
who would rejoice at that opportunity of joining him, beſides ſo many
others in diſtreſſed circumſtances, or on bad terms with the government,
whom fear, reſentment, or hope would influence; and there are men of
that character, in every country, but no where ſo many as there are at
preſent in Great Britain. But it is certain that the greateſt number of the
Scots are diſpoſed to join their King from inclination, and from a
principle of loyalty. This is evident, from all that they have ſuffered,
with ſo much conſtancy, for above two and twenty years; and that there
is a conſiderable number of them, appears from the apprehenſions the
government entertain of them, and the meaſures they take to apprehend
the leaders on every alarm. But there are, beſides, a ſet of men, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed,
who have taken the oaths to the government only by form,
and from intereſt, and whom general Stanhope, in Sacheverel's trial,
calls the nonjuror-ſwearers. Theſe are very numerous in the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
There is not a high-church man in England that is not ſuſpected
by the government. This is the caſe with all thoſe who have preſented
addreſſes for maintaining hereditary right and the maxim of the church
of England, that a prince is never to be reſiſted; and theſe comprehend
almoſt the whole nation, excepting ſuch as are Whigs or Preſbyterians
by profeſſion; who, however, are become the contempt and averſion of
the people.</p>
                  <p>Malicious and injurious expreſſions againſt the King are no longer uſed,
even by the Whigs, who dare not now expreſs themſelves as they did
formerly. They acknowledged his birth in Sacheverel's trial, in order
to deſtroy hereditary right by that means, and to convince the princeſs
of Denmark, that ſhe has no other title to the crown, but the ſettlement
which has been made for the ſucceſſion ſince the Revolution; and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
ſpeak with eſteem and reſpect of the King's perſon.</p>
                  <p>I do not intend to conceal any thing. The only objection againſt the
King is his religion; but that is not imputed to him as a fault, but as
his misfortune and ours; and the people would endure him much more
willingly, if they did not believe him a bigot to his religion; and this
is the idea his enemies endeavour to give of him as much as they can.</p>
                  <p>To obviate this objection, the following means are judged uſeful, by
his Majeſty's friends, who perſuade themſelves that he will be ready to
do, on his part, all that is lawful for him, to bring about his reſtoration;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0950500102:230"/>
and God forbid that more ſhould be demanded of him, to gain even all
the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, The King of England, therefore, muſt not, either by word or by
inſinuation, give any reaſon to believe that he is capable of diſſembling
his religion. Every one would have a worſe opinion of him, on that
account, and leſs credit would be given to all that he could ſay.</p>
                  <p>But, to remove the objection of bigotry and blind zeal, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
he ſhould acquaint his ſubjects, that when it ſhall pleaſe God to
reſtore him to his kingdoms, and to give him a proper opportunity, he
will not refuſe to hear whatever can be ſaid to him, with reſpect and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
in favour of the religion of his dominions. But whatever may
be the iſſue of this, with regard to his Majeſty's religion, that will not
diminiſh our loyalty and our entire ſubmiſſion to him as our lawful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.</p>
                  <p>It is not underſtood by this, that there is to be a public diſpute, which
is a ſort of combat of gladiators for victory, and which ends generally
in increaſing the differences, and exaſperating the animoſities, upon both
ſides; the pride of man having a natural averſion to appear to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced:
accordingly when reaſons fail, pride ſummons all the paſſions
to its aid, and then the combat is carried on with bitterneſs, and with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
reflections, which produce a hatred that excludes all means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
                  <p>No, this is not pretended; it is propoſed only, that his Britannic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhould not refuſe to hear a reaſonable man, who will explain to him,
with all the deference and reſpect that is due to him, the principles of
the church of England; and that, afterwards, he ſhould determine as
God and his conſcience will dictate to him; but, at the ſame time, he
ſhould preſerve to the church of England all legal ſecurities for its eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
and ſupport.</p>
                  <p>2dly, It is propoſed, in order to remove all ſuſpicion and prejudice
againſt his Majeſty, that, when he comes over, he ſhould bring no more
prieſts along with him than he has occaſion for. It is the intereſt of the
King of England, eſpecially on his arrival, to give the people advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
impreſſions of him; afterwards things will be more eaſy. When
he is on the throne, and the people find that their religion, their liberty,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0950500102:231"/>
and their fortunes arc ſafe, he may then have as many prieſts with him

                  <p>3dly, If his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would only connive at allowing
the Proteſtant domeſtics of the King of England to aſſemble themſelves,
from time to time, at St. Germains, in order to worſhip God in the moſt
ſecret manner that poſſibly could be, that would do more ſervice than
10,000 men. For, in England, that would appear as a ſort of toleration,
with regard to his attendants; and, being obtained by his Britanni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
every one would conſider it as a mark of his inclination to favour
his proteſtant ſubjects, and as a pledge of what they might expect from
him, when he was reſtored to his throne. Beſides that, it would entirely
remove the objection of bigotry. If it could be ſaid in England, that
the King has procured for the proteſtant ſervants who attend him, the
liberty which is here propoſed for them, that would be half the way to
his reſtoration. I only repeat here the very words which I have heard
from ſenſible men in London.</p>
                  <p>4thly, When the King of England comes, it will be proper to have in
his company ſome miniſter of the church of England, who is of an
approved character, in order to preach to the people, as ſoon as he lands,
without truſting to chance, and employing the firſt whom he finds on the
place, and who may be either diſaffected or incapable.</p>
                  <p>5thly, It is neceſſary to bring along with him all the Iriſh troops,
who will be very agreeable to the Highlanders, becauſe they ſpeak the
ſame language; but, above all, to bring the duke of Berwick along with
him; for he is feared and loved, and his preſence will prevent all the
diſputes which may ariſe among the nobility of Scotland for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the army; for they will all ſubmit to him, and they all deſire
that he may come.</p>
                  <p>Time preſſes and appears ſhort; for, according to all appearances,
the next winter will produce a peace, and then the King of England
muſt be reduced to begin every thing a-new for bringing about his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration,
and to ſeek new and uncertain meaſures to accompliſh it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0950500102:232"/>
If the princeſs of Denmark, who is very infirm, dies, and if the
prince of Hannover is once in poſſeſſion, he will bring along with him
his German troops, who, in virtue of the laſt act of parliament, will be
naturalized the moment they arrive; and he will humble and ruin all the
King of England's friends, and render, by theſe means, his cauſe deſperate."</p>
                  <p>[The pen is drawn through what follows.]</p>
                  <p>"If his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty is not in a condition now to furniſh
troops and other ſuccours neceſſary to the King of England, for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
into Scotland, may not ſome propoſals be made to the King of
Sweden? Will not that prince be very well pleaſed to have ſuch an ally
to aſſiſt him to obtain ſatisfaction from the King of Denmark, and to
defend his coaſts againſt the Muſcovites? And, in caſe of a double
marriage, which might be propoſed to him, he would have a chance of
ſucceeding to the crown of England, as the King of England would have
to that of Sweden. Their religion cannot be objected againſt the Swedes,
for the prince of Hannover is a Lutheran.</p>
                  <p>If his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty chooſes rather to land 5 or 10,000 men, to
the aſſiſtance of the King of Sweden, than to riſk his troops and his ſhips
on an expedition to Scotland, the King of Sweden might ſend an equal
number of troops to Scotland much more eaſily, becauſe the paſſage is
much ſhorter; and conſidering that that prince is engaged in ſitting out
conſiderable armaments, both by ſea and by land, againſt the Danes,
and againſt the Muſcovites, the real deſigns of his preparations will never
be ſuſpected. He may be the more eaſily reconciled to this, that the
government of England is not very favourably diſpoſed towards him, of
which his Swediſh Majeſty appears, by his laſt declaration, to be very
ſenſible; declaring war againſt them, in ſome meaſure, and conſidering
them as the aggreſſors, becauſe they engaged to maintain a neutrality in
the north of Germany: and nothing appears more natural, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the genius of that prince, than to enter into an alliance with the
King of England, who may write to him, by the means of the Swediſh
reſident, who is here, until he can ſend a miniſter to treat with him
Beſides, that prince is guarantee of the peace of Riſwick, and has a right
to intereſt himſelf in the preſent war; and, by an alliance with the King
of England, he might once more have the balance of Europe in his hands,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0950500102:233"/>
and give a general peace upon reaſonable terms; and theſe two princes
thus allied, would be in a condition to maintain the peace againſt all
thoſe who would incline to diſturb it, and to prevent any rebellion that
might ariſe in their reſpective dominions."</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>"SINCE you deſire my opinion upon the preſent ſtate of affairs of our
country, and that you aſſure me I may, with all ſafety, conſide
my private thoughts to you, I ſhall tell you here very plainly what I think
moſt adviſeable in the preſent conjuncture.</p>
                  <p>I need not go about to prove, that the houſe of Hannover and the
States of Holland are united with the Whigs and diſcontented party of
England; againſt the Queen, her preſent miniſtry, and the church of
England.</p>
                  <p>Their late proceedings have ſufficiently ſhewn their inclinations that
way; and nothing is more obvious, than that the church and court party
can expect no quarter from theſe three united powers, if ever they come
to have the ſuperiority. They think they have been very ill uſed, and
after reſenting their pretended injuries ſo publickly as they have done,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0950500102:234"/>
it is not to be expected they will ever hardly pardon. 'Tis pretty plain
they are in a ſort of confederacy together, and that they are reſolved to
ſtand and fall by one another. The duke of Hannover has, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the States, declared himſelf ſo openly for the Whig party,
in oppoſition to the Queen herſelf, as well as her miniſtry, that it is
viſible he is inſeparably united to that party, and will always be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
by it; and that if ever he comes to have the power in his hands,
the church and preſent miniſtry muſt fall a ſacrifice to the Whigs' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
the breach being too wide to expect they can ever be thoroughly
reconciled.</p>
                  <p>I am of opinion, therefore, that as matters ſtand now, there remains
only one expedient that can poſſibly ſecure, at once, both the church and
ſtate againſt any attempt that may be made to their prejudice, either
during the Queen's life, or after her death, by a powerful, abſolute
prince, ſupported by a jealous, intereſted nation abroad, and animated
by an exaſperated, factious party at home; and that is to call home the
Queen's brother, whoſe juſt right gains ground daily in the hearts of his
ſubjects: in order to which, I think it not only adviſable, but abſolutely
neceſſary, to ſend to treat with him without loſs of time; for all depends
upon taking timely meaſures, it being of the laſt importance to the
court and country intereſt, as well as his, to be before-hand with their
common adverſaries. Accidents may happen; we are all mortal; and
if things be not prepared and ſecured before a vacancy, it will be very
hard, after that, to avoid a civil war: for we all know, that, according
to the laws now in being, Hannover, in that caſe, muſt of courſe be
proclaimed King. It will be too late then to repeal thoſe laws which
make it high treaſon to oppoſe him; and it is not to be doubted but he
will quickly come over here, and bring with him (if it be neceſſary)
all the force the Hollanders and he can draw together. On the other
hand, it is certain the King will not be wanting, on his ſide, to tranſport
himſelf, at any rate, into ſome part of his dominions, to join with
his friends, in order to aſſert his right, and venture all, rather than have
the ſhame and grief to ſee a foreign U—r take peaceable poſſeſſion of
his lawful inheritance. This muſt unavoidably produce a civil war,
which is, perhaps, what the Hollanders wiſh for; the fatal conſequences
of which may laſt and extend, nobody knows how far.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0950500102:235"/>
The only remedy I ſee to prevent theſe misfortunes, and ſave our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from ruin and bloodſhed, is the propoſal above mentioned, of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
immediately upon the concluſion of the peace, to treat with her
Majeſty's brother, the King, and call him home privately upon the firſt
receſs of parliament.</p>
                  <p>This is abſolutely the quickeſt, ſafeſt, and eaſieſt way; for all other
flow, dilatory methods of preparing things by degrees, managing the
oppoſite party, waiting for new favourable opportunities, and keeping,
in the mean time, this prince at a diſtance, are expoſed to too many
dangers and difficulties, beſides that unanſwerable one of a ſudden mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
which, as it may very poſſibly happen, to our great grief and
misfortune, when we expect it leaſt, ſo it is the height of imprudence
not to prepare againſt it.</p>
                  <p>It would require a great deal of more time, than we can in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
promiſe to ourſelves, to go about to repeal the act of the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the crown, in a parliamentary way, before he be called over;
ſo I think that tedious method nowiſe adviſable. Beſides that, the
undertaking itſelf might meet with ſuch oppoſition, in his abſence, as
would expoſe it to the danger of a miſcarriage; whereas, he being once
upon the place invited thither, and countenanced by her Majeſty (which,
is no hard matter to contrive, ſo as to make it very practicable in the
receſs of parliament, without the leaſt danger of diſturbance) thoſe very
perſons, who would have oppoſed him in parliament, and every where
elſe in his abſence, will be the firſt to come and kiſs his hand when
he is here, and comply with whatever the Queen ſhall think fit to do
in his favour.</p>
                  <p>It is ſo viſibly the Queen's and the preſent miniſtry's true intereſt to
call her only brother home, in this conjuncture, that he and they may
be a mutual ſupport and ſecurity to one another, that I am morally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
he will not make the leaſt difficulty to truſt himſelf entirely into
their hands, whenever they pleaſe to call him; and that he will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
even to come over with a page only to accompany him, upon the
Queen his ſiſter's letter, if it be thought fit and neceſſary for his and
their common intereſt ſo to do: and when he is once here, I am ſure
nobody will dare to find fault with the Queen's receiving him kindly.
She may ſafely preſent him to her council, own him there for her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0950500102:236"/>
and declare her good intentions towards him, and what ſhe has
thought fit, with the advice of her miniſters, to treat and concert with
him, for the future good and peace of her kingdoms. After which ſtep
it will be infinitely more eaſy and leſs hazardous by any other method
whatſoever, to get the preſent ſettlement of the ſucceſſion altered, in the
next meeting of the parliament, and every thing regulated there to their
mutual ſatisfaction; and all the rights and privileges of church and ſtate,
crown, parliament, and people ſettled again upon the ſolid foundation of
the ancient laws and conſtitution of the kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But to aſſure the ſucceſs of this great work, I think it abſolutely beſt,
when he is invited over, that he be allowed to come ſtraight to London,
where his ſudden and unexpected appearance will ſurpriſe and confound
all his unprepared enemies, break all their meaſures, and make every
thing go ſo quick and eaſy on the Queen's ſide and his, that they will
ſoon, by the wiſe conduct of the preſent miniſtry, put it out of the
power of either Hannover or the diſcontented Whigs to diſturb the new
ſettlement that ſhall be agreed upon, between the brother and his now
only ſiſter. But, in caſe things be not thought ripe enough, or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
diſpoſed to bring him ſtraight to London, the next beſt will be
to bring him to Scotland; which would be better by far, than ſending
him a travelling into foreign countries. Only one thing is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
as to Scotland, that the government of the church there being
Preſbyterian, and the generality of that nation being diſcontented with
the Union, which we in England think our intereſt to maintain, he may,
perhaps, have ſome hard propoſals made to him upon that head, by a
prevalent party in that kingdom, which will make him very uneaſy, by
putting a diſagreeable neceſſity upon him of refuſing what he cannot
grant to them, without diſobliging the Engliſh, which I have good
reaſon to be believe he is reſolved not to do; it being contrary to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
as well as his intereſt, to do any thing in favour of one nation,
that may be a juſt ground of grievance to another; his intention, as I
am credibly informed, being to leave all thoſe matters of ſtate, as well
as of religion, to be entirely decided and ſettled in a Britiſh parliament.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, I have (in compliance to your deſire) opened my mind
freely to you upon a very nice point. I hope, from your friendſhip for
me, and your known diſcretion in matters of this importance, that you
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0950500102:237"/>
will not communicate this paper, but where you are ſure it will be ſafe,
and where you have reaſon to hope it may be of ſome uſe. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with aſſuring you, that you are the only perſon to whom it is ſent,
and that neither the perſon by whoſe conveyance it comes, nor any other
perſon whatever on your ſide, knows any thing of the contents of it.
Any thing that tends towards Jacobitiſm (as I own this letter does) ſounds
ill in the ears of thoſe who are always uſed to tack popery, ſlavery, and
arbitrary government together; and have no other notion of a popiſh
King, but that of a bigot tyrant. But I, who know from unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
hands, that the Pretender (as we call him here) beſides his other
great and good qualities, is too wiſe and too juſt a prince to think of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
any body for his religion; that, on the contrary, all thoſe of
our church, that are about him at preſent, have diſtinguiſhed marks of
his bounty ſhewn to them, with aſſurances that it ſhall not be his fault
if they have not the full exerciſe of their religion whenever they go with
him. I, who know alſo, that he has ſent particular directions to his
friends here, to join themſelves unanimouſly to vote for and ſupport the
meaſures of the court and preſent miniſtry, with all the intereſt they
have, am not only fully perſuaded of his true affection for his ſiſter, and
love for his country, but am alſo convinced, in my conſcience, that our
eſtabliſhed religion, as well as our liberties, eſtates, and employments,
and every thing elſe that is dear to us, will be infinitely more ſecure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his government, than under a Lutheran foreign prince, influenced
by German and Whig counſels: and, therefore, to you I am not afraid
nor aſhamed to own myſelf, ſo far a Jacobite as to wiſh a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
between our gracious Queen and her brother, which I look upon
to be the only means to make her Majeſty happy, eaſy, and ſafe, as long
as ſhe lives, our preſent miniſtry out of danger of being ever oppreſſed
by their enemies, our church ſafe, and our country happy. To be a
Jacobite, at this rate, in my opinion, is to be a true patriot and a faithful
ſubject; and I hope you do me the juſtice to have no other opinion of,
Sir, &amp;c.</p>

circumſtances, enter into diſputes of religion; but thoſe of the
church of England have no reaſon to doubt of my favour and protection,
after the early aſſurances I gave them in my inſtructions, bearing date
the 3d March, 1702, which you have ſeen, and I am reſolved to make
good. I know my grand-father and my father too had always a good
opinion of the principles of the church of England relating to monarchy;

this they chance to differ with me: nor ſhall I refuſe, in due time and

not take it ill if I uſe the ſame liberty I allow to others, to adhere to the

                  <p>"I Have been away theſe two months ſince I writ my laſt to you, and
my journey home being much about the ſame time your lawyer
[Churchill] was in motion, made him a little concerned for fear he ſhould
not have had an opportunity of ſpeaking to me before he left theſe parts
for good and all: this he ſhewed in a more open manner than uſual, for
he aſked particularly after [of] me of [after] one that had gone from
our town to wait upon him, and commiſſioned him, at his return, to
inquire whether I was come back or no; and if ſo, to tell me he had a mind
to ſee me. But at this gentleman's return, I not being arrived, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
to ſend any more to our houſe, and I had like to have loſt the
news of this intimation. As ſoon as I knew it, in the uncertainty I was
in to find Mr. James [Churchill], your lawyer, I writ to one of his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
to know more in particular his deſires, and where I might wait
upon him, who immediately anſwered me, as from his maſter, and fixed
me the place where he was to ſtay ſome days: whereupon, the time
preſſing of both ſides, I took poſt, and had two long conferences with
him about Mr. Bernard's [the Queen's] lawſuit, and Mr. Kelly's [the
King's] affairs. As to both which he ſhews a good-will, and gives, in
appearance, ſincere wiſhes; but how far he will be able to work effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in the matter, I leave you to judge. Firſt, as to Mr. Bernard's
[the Queen's] deed, he ſays, it muſt be inſiſted upon in time; for
he looks upon it certain that an accommodation [peace] will be
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0950500102:244"/>
made; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">month </seg>November.</label> and if he ſhall be found capable of helping on the ſigning this
deed, he aſſures Mr. Bernard [the Queen] of his beſt ſervices. (But he
believes meaſures are taken in ſuch a manner, that he ſhall be excluded
from having any hand in concluding matters at Povey [peace]: but
could not ſome one work to gain Mr. Mathew [Harley] and Nathaniel
[Maſham]?) He looks upon the ſtrongly inſiſting upon, and gaining
this point of the deed to be of great conſequence, not only as to the
making my lady Betty [the Queen] eaſy as to her own circumſtances,
but very much conducing to the advancing Mr. Athony's [the King's]
intereſt: and this not ſo much again as to the money itſelf, as that the
grant of it, (which cannot be refuſed, it being formerly concluded and
granted at Povey [peace], and funds being ſet aſide for it, and only
diverted by "the unworthineſs of him who then ruled the roaſt)" and
continual payment, will be a means to make people open their eyes,
even in regard to Mr. Andrew [the King], and ſee better their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in reference to the ſame, "whoſe cauſe has got ſo much ſenſible
ground for theſe latter years, that, (to aſſure me more, I ſuppoſe, of
his real interior ſentiments) he ſwore ſolemnly he thought it could not
fail of coming to a happy iſſue: nay, that both ſides would ſee an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
neceſſity of having recourſe to him, as the only means left of ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſolid peace and happineſs: not ſo much, perchance, (either Mr.
Robert [High Church] or couſin. Simon [Whigs]) out of any true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of conſcience or honeſty, for he does not think either deſerves the
name of Lumſdell [Loyal].</p>
                  <p>As to Mr. Antony's [the King's] buſineſs, it muſt be managed with
a great deal of dexterity. He was not a little ſtartled at the news of his
going to Mr. Price [the Pope]; it would not have been well at all. He
ſays, when they begin to work at Povey [peace], perchance Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
[King of France] and his Fredlingers [miniſters], (who will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to conſecrate any thing to their own ends) will be conſenting to Mr.
Athony's [the King's] going to live ſome where with Mr. Price [the
Pope], or ſome where in that country, and he fancies that ſomething of
that kind may be inſiſted upon by others in Evans [England]; by that
means to perſuade the tenants that they are altogether for excluding the
Thomiſts [Catholics], and all for Gregory (Hannover]. "But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
as much as he can judge of things, that Mr. Athony's [the King's]
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0950500102:245"/>
going thither muſt never be granted to." And this he looks upon as a
point of the laſt importance; for he declares, he thinks it abſolutely
contrary to Mr. Athony's intereſt; and, therefore, though Mr. Edward
[King of France] ſhould conſent to it, and people in Evans [England]
puſh for it, it muſt not be done: and he deſired me in particular to aſſure
you of this, (and he ſwore it by the living God) that he thought, that
if Mr. Benjamin [the Queen] ever conſented to this, that 'twas no better
than ruining and quite murdering this ſon's, the Grot's [King's] cauſe.
If it be neceſſary, or judged advantageous to quit Forſter [France], let
him go to his uncle David [Germany], or rather have recourſe to ſome
free ſeat. But I aſked him, what ſecurity for his perſon, there being
ſuch a writ out againſt him? He anſwered, he really did not think he
wanted any ſecurity, for nobody would touch him. "As for his part,
he had ſeen ſuch viſible changes for the better of late, on all ſides, that
he thought the gaining of his cauſe could not but follow." And when
he gets his eſtate, he hopes he will make his tenants eaſy; and not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of annulling any regulations, made for the cutting down woods, and
altering other farms, for theſe many years; for that will bring dangerous
conſequences, the intereſt of ſo many perſons being engaged, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would come in to him.</p>
                  <p>When Mrs. Betty's deed [the Queen's jointure] is inſiſted upon, if it
was to be put to Philip Cook [the parliament], you will find many, he is
perſuaded, even willing to help it on, and glad of an occaſion of making
their compliments <hi>à bon grace,</hi> and giving ſome teſtimony of their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.
If ſhe thinks, that he ſhall be in any capacity of ſerving her in this
point, ſhe needs only to ſignify to him what ſhe expects from him, and
he will be very glad of the occaſion of ſhowing himſelf her humble
ſervant. He inſinuated a deſire you ſhould be ſenſible, that what he has
done for theſe many years, (and ſeem to affirm the ſame of others) has
not been out of any ſpleen or ill-will againſt you, but only to put down
Foſter [France], which he always judged the true intereſt of Mrs.
Edwards [England], whoſe cauſe alone he pleaded for. He thinks
certainly there will be an accommodation; for when he was, laſt winter,
at Mrs. Evans [England], he ſaw ſo much of the diſpoſition of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that if all were to be polled, nine in ten would abſolutely vote
for Povey [peace], being ſpent, on all ſides, by ſo long a law-ſuit.</p>

                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0950500102:246"/>
A great many, he ſays, have taken ſtrange methods, of late, which,
contrary to the intentions of thoſe that made uſe of them, will prove very
much to the advantage of Mr. Andrew's [the King's] cauſe; and God,
who rules above, ſeems viſibly to diſpoſe all things for the beſt. Neither
your couſin Temple, [the Tories] nor Wilſon [the Whigs] are much to
be relyed on, quatenus ſuch; but all that they have or ſeem to be
a doing, will inſenſibly reduce both of them, more and more, to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of doing Mr. Athony's [the King's] buſineſs, and even calling for
him.</p>
                  <p>To ſignify theſe things to you, was the reaſon of his calling for me,
and he deſired I would tike an occaſion of waiting upon you for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
but I hope the writing this will ſuffice; if not, you know where
to command. After my compliments to him, I told him, as to myſelf,
I was much more afraid of the iſſue of his ſuits, in this following ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
than in the former. He owned, he had been treated unworthily,
upon ſeveral accounts: but that was nothing. For his part, God had
bleſſed him with a great deal of temper, and he had taken the reſolution
of being quiet for the preſent; but he would expect his time; and if
Mr. Matthew [Harley] or others puſhed things to greater extremities,
they ſhould give him, perchance, only better hold, and they ſhould find
what metal he was made of.</p>
                  <p>He deſired, that his compliments might be made, in a particular
manner, to Mr. Barker [Berwick] and Mr. Wal. [E. Midd.] and bade
me tell the latter, that he hoped Mr. Wal. [E. Midd.] would live to ſee
better times, and more according to his ſatisfaction. He was pleaſed to
aſk me many queſtions about Mr. Walter's [E. Midd.'s] converſion; and
ſaid, he had heard, at the beginning, as if he had had a mind of retiring
from buſineſs, for good and all. As for his converſion, I told him,
it was beyond all doubt, truly ſolid, and certainly upon motives alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
chriſtian; and for the rumour of his having a mind to retire,
perchance, his retiring to our little ſeminary, at Onkſi [Paris], might
give occaſion of that rumour; but this was only to do his work he had
undertaken more efficaciouſly, and firſt cleanſe the garden of ſo many
weeds that had overrun it, and ſecondly plant the ſame, with neceſſary
adornments. (I think he anſwered, it is what we muſt all come to; but
I did not underſtand him perfectly).</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0950500102:247"/>
As for the working at Povey [peace], he thought they had taken all
their meaſures to do the buſineſs without him; and as for his part, he
deſired nothing more than to be at quiet. Some buſineſs to ſettle mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
abroad, would detain him yet a little while, at Mr. Harriſon's
[Holland]; but when that was done, he would haſten home, where he
would maintain himſelf againſt them all; and if Mr. Mathews [Harley]
or others puſhed matters any farther againſt him, perchance ſo much
the better.</p>
                  <p>But, after he had uſed a great many compliments, &amp;c. towards you, I
thought it would not be amiſs, civilly to urge him to ſomething more
poſitive, and endeavour to ſee if there were any more ſolid aſſurances to
be had from him, above what one might call a compliment; and for the
purpoſe, I objected this to him, that ſome might ſay, he being a lawyer
of ſuch intereſt, why would not he ſtickle more in Mr. Anthony [the
King] and Barnard's [the Queen's] ſuits? He anſwered, he did not
know what he could do directly in the matter; but only by managing
people ſo, on occaſions, as to make them enter into the aforeſaid inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts;
and they might aſſure themſelves, nothing ſhould be wanting on
his ſide, as occaſions ſhould preſent. He owned, indeed, that he had
acted with a great deal of animoſity againſt Foſter [France], (and he
always thought it the intereſt of his country ſo to do) but not againſt
them; and really ſeemed to ſhew a great deſire of all things proſpering
with you, and ſaid, that God Almighty had diſpoſed things ſo, that he
ſolemnly ſwore again, that he thought Mr. Anthony's [the King's] bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
could not fail of going forward, and that his Rode [religion] would
not be any hinderance to it, for all the proteſtations Evans [England]
had made to the contrary. He ſays, he knows your couſin Harry
[princeſs of Denmark] perfectly well; that he is a very honeſt perſon,
but eaſily won and wrought upon; but, at the bottom, he certainly has
no averſion from his brother Alexander [the King]. But he [princeſs
Anne] is one that muſt not be frightened; and the lawyer [Churchill]
ſays, he thinks any extern force uſed, will rather do more harm than
good, both in regard of Harry [princeſs Anne] and others. Whereas,
if one will but let things go on their own train, Alexander [the King's]
buſineſs will go on of itſelf, and he does not doubt, but will come to
a happy concluſion.</p>

between France and England. Mr. Prior went to France in the month
of July, and came back with Mr. Meſnager and the abbé Gaultier, in

about the latter end of September; and notwithſtanding the remonſtrances

hierarchy, having ſuch a cloſe connexion, and ſo much dependence
the one upon the other; the one cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt without the other,
as might be eaſily ſhown, by arguments and examples. A King muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely

                        <p>And, in order to remove all their uneaſineſs on the article of religion,
it may be ſhown to them, that, in the year 1702, the King having been
informed, by men of rank of the church of England, that, in order to
render their religion perfectly ſecure under a Catholic King, they wiſhed
that his Majeſty would grant them certain privileges, even beyond what
the acts of parliament and common law of the kingdom allow them;
his Majeſty having examined their demands, granted them immediately,
although they could not deny themſelves, but by granting them, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
from the rights and prerogatives of the crown."</p>

the ſucceſſion of the crown, by re-eſtabliſhing it in the right line; and
it appears likewiſe, that the catholic religion, which is the only thing
that can be objected to the King, is of no prejudice to them, but, on
the contrary, an advantage, as his Majeſty yields to the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
what no Proteſtant King would yield to them; therefore, the
members of that church will find their account, and have their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges

                     <p>"After the act, which exchanged the ſucceſſion, ſhall be repealed,
it would be neceſſary to ſend over the King to England, that he might
learn what is neceſſary for him to know, in order to govern his people,
by inſtructing himſelf in the laws and cuſtoms of the country; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0950500102:251"/>
that he might be before-hand with the Dutch, who might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
upon the firſt news of the death of the reigning princeſs, tranſport
thither the prince of Hannover, which would infallibly produce a civil
war, with which they would be very well pleaſed, becauſe they would

who has not the beſt title on his ſide, will ſtand in need of a
foreign ſupport to maintain him; and, as he cannot find it any where but
with them, they will by that dependence, reaſſume the direction of all
the affairs of England, as they did during the government of the prince
of Orange, which will nowiſe ſuit either the humours or the intereſts of
the Engliſh nation.</p>
                     <p>When the King would be tranſported to England, the beſt means of
ſecuring to him the ſucceſſion would be to treat him as a ſovereign, in
which, it does not appear, there would be any inconveniency to the
reigning princeſs; who, for aſſociating her brother to the royal title,
will not the leſs peaceably enjoy all her authority, during her own life;
as it has been ſeen lately, that the kingdom was governed peaceably, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of the King of England's ſubjects, given to the Marquis de Torcy,
in December, 1711.</head>
                  <p>THIS memorial recites, that the late King had made a ſettlement of
50,000<hi>l.</hi> ſterling upon the Queen, by letters patent under the
great ſeal, which was afterwards confirmed by acts of parliament which
have never been repealed; that according to the prerogatives of the Queens
of England, ſhe had appointed her own officers and diſpoſed of her

undoubted right to what is due ſince ſhe left England; and that, if ſhe
could claim it, according to the uſual forms, there is not a court of
juſtice in England, but what would decide it in her favour.</p>
                  <p>The memorial mentions, in the next place, that her pretenſions were

                  <p>
                     <q>"A promiſe ſo ſolemn, reiterated, and confirmed, in a manner ſo
poſitive and ſo preciſe, and without any condition, ſhould not have met
with any difficulty in the execution; and the more ſo, that the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of England made no difficulty of teſtifying, in a very effectual
manner, their approbation of that promiſe, by furniſhing the prince with
the means of performing it: for, in the firſt ſeſſion after the peace, the
commons aſſembled in parliament, granted him a new fund of a hundred
thouſand pounds ſterling of an additional revenue, of which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
the half to ſupply the funds on which the appanage had been
aſſigned, and which had been otherwiſe employed; and to ſhow further,
that it was their intention that the ſum ſhould be paid honeſtly to the
Queen, according to the promiſe publickly and poſitively made, in the
name of the nation, without exacting any condition from her Majeſty,
they added a clauſe, by which it was declared, that thoſe who ſhould be
employed to remit the money to the Queen, in France, ſhould not be
ſubject to the penalties of the law which forbade all correſpondence
with the court of St. Germains. This evidently ſhows, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
condition, which was afterwards alleged to elude the payment,
was ill-founded; and that the parliament never thought of exacting ſuch
conditions."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The memorial next propoſes, that at the enſuing treaty of peace, the

the arrears, due ſince the Revolution, at leaſt ſince the treaty of Ryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,

done; particularly, that the Queen ſhould be at liberty to nominate
any perſon ſhe choſe to receive her money, and to grant valid diſcharges
to the government of England, without her being obliged to ſign any
other deed, engagement, or acknowledgment, but a procuration to them
to act in her name."</p>

year, a ſhort detail of leading facts may be neceſſary. The baron
de Bothmar, envoy extraordinary from the Elector, arrived in London,
early this year. Though the duke of Marlborough was permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the command of the army, the dutcheſs was deprived of all her
employments; and Harley, at the deſire of the Queen, informed the
court of Hannover of her diſmiſſion. The Electoral Prince, who had
been elected a Knight of the Garter in 1706, was inſtalled at Windſor in
December 1710; the lord Halifax ſerving as his proxy. The earl of
Rocheſter, the Queen's maternal uncle, who, from his rank, abilities,
experience in buſineſs, and influence with the high-church party, was the
only rival of Harley, died ſuddenly, in the May of the preſent year. A
fair field being left for Harley's ambition, he became lord-treaſurer, earl
of Oxford and Mortimer, and was conſidered as prime miniſter.</p>
               <p>Marlborough, endeavouring to overcome his enemies in the cabinet by
the ſplendour of his actions in the field, made various, but unſucceſsful,
efforts to force the Mareſchal de Villars to a battle. He, however, by a
ſudden exertion, ſurpriſed the famous lines with which the French had
joined the Scheld, the Sanſette, the Scarpe, and the Ugy. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of this enterpriſe was the ſiege and ſurrender of Bouchain, the
laſt exploit of the duke of Marlborough. Mr. Matthew Prior, having
been ſent clandeſtinely by the miniſtry with preliminaries of peace to
France, arrived at Fountainbleau, in the month of July. Lewis the XIV.
afraid either to accept or refuſe the terms offered by Prior, ſent to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
in his company, Monſ. Menager and the famous Abbé du Bois. An
intimate correſpondence was eſtabliſhed between the Britiſh and French
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0950500102:254"/>
miniſters; and preliminary articles, to the ſatisfaction of both, were ſigned
on the twenty-ſeventh of September. The Queen ſent the earl of Rivers
to Hannover, to aſſure the Elector, that the ſucceſſion of his family to
the crown of Great Britain ſhould be ſecured in the treaty. The earl of
Oxford and his aſſociates made the ſame aſſurances, in vain; the jealouſy
of his Electoral Highneſs having been raiſed by the emiſſaries of the
Whigs.</p>
               <p>The lord Raby, who had been appointed, in the preceding March,
ambaſſador extraordinary to the States-general, was created earl of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
in the beginning of September, and in the end of that month was
ſent back to Holland, to preſs the opening of a general congreſs. The
privy-ſeal, upon the death of the duke of Newcaſtle, was delivered into
the cuſtody of Dr. Robinſon, biſhop of Briſtol, who was intended to be
joined as plenipotentiary to the earl of Strafford, on the expected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.
Doctor Swift gives the character of both very juſtly, in a few
words. <q rend="inline">"They were practiced in buſineſs, but poſſeſſed no parts.
Strafford hath ſome life and ſpirit; but is infinitely proud, and wholly
illiterate."</q> His lordſhip's letters, indeed, furniſh no proof of his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and Robinſon was a heavy, though decent man.</p>
               <p>An incident, in Scotland, employed the attention of the court of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover,
in the preſent year. The dutcheſs of Gordon, a Roman Catholic,
preſuming on the temper of the times, ſent a medal of the Pretender to
Mr. Robert Bennet, dean of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh.
This piece of ſilver had a legend upon it, importing that the kingdom
ſhould be reſtored to the right owner. At a meeting of the Faculty,
thanks were voted to her Grace; and Mr. Robert Dundas of Arniſton
returned them, in terms ſufficiently ſeditious and bold. He thanked
her for preſenting them with a medal of their ſovereign lord the King.
He hoped, that her Grace would ſoon have an opportunity of preſenting
to the faculty of Advocates a ſecond medal, ſtruck upon the reſtoration
of the King and royal family, and the finiſhing of rebellion, uſurpation,
tyranny, and whiggery. No inquiry was made into this affair, till the
baron de Kreyenberg, in the name of his maſter, the Elector, complained
of the conduct of the advocates to the Queen. In compliance with his
repreſentation, Sir David Dalrymple, the lord advocate, who was a
Whig, when it ſuited with his own intereſt, was diſmiſſed from his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0950500102:255"/>

an equal number of recruits for the Engliſh infantry, and five battalions
of an augmentation: it is expected that theſe have failed already. This
is intended as an example to excite the court of Vienna and the States-general
to exert themſelves likewiſe on their ſide. Prince Eugene, at parting,
gave reaſon to hope that the Emperor would ſend four battalions to Spain,
if the States would do as much. The province of Holland has taken a
favourable reſolution in conſequence of this; and it is hoped, the other
provinces will ſoon follow the example, eſpecially as count Zinzendorff
has ſince declared his Imperial Majeſty's conſent to this augmentation.
Theſe troops will be a powerful ſuccour, if they arrive in time, and the
greateſt care will be taken that they ſhall; but the bad news we have
lately received from that country will oblige both the one and the other
to take ſtill more vigorous reſolutions.</p>

kindneſs, and to be perſuaded of the inviolable and reſpectful attachment

poſſeſs themſelves of any place of ſtrength in Pomerania, the ſeaſon
being too far advanced, it is to be preſumed that the troops, after having
ravaged the enemy's country, will return to take up their winter-quarters
in Mecklenburg, and in other places in the circle of the Lower Saxony;
and that his Daniſh Majeſty will chooſe to place troops in the country of
Bremen. It is eaſy to conceive, that, by that means, the ſlames of war
may extend themſelves farther into the empire, to the great prejudice of
the allies; and you know, beſides, Sir, that the ſituation of my domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

and dragoons here next winter; it being impoſſible to be able, with four
or five battalions, which are left with me, to provide with any efficacy
for the ſafety of my dominions, and of all this neighbourhood. I will,
therefore, have a very particular obligation to you, if you employ your
influence to obtain permiſſion from the Queen for ſome of the regiments
of cavalry and dragoons, which I have in her Majeſty's pay, to come
back to my own dominions after the campaign, as the regiment of Haher
came back laſt winter, and upon the ſame footing. They may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

next winter, which will oblige me to recall all the troops I have in the

                  <p>I ſhall employ all my attentions to divert the court of Denmark from
forming this project. But, my lord, you are too penetrating not to ſee,
that having but very few infantry, without any cavalry, in my domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
I cannot exert myſelf with efficacy for the ſecurity of this neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood

order to give weight to the negociations which I deſign to ſet on foot
with the enemies of Sweden, and to the propoſals which I may make to
them, that I ſhould have ſome cavalry and dragoons here next winter.
As the deſign I have in view is the common intereſt of all the allies, and
as I ſhall act in perfect concert with the Queen, I hope her Majeſty will
permit ſome of the regiments of cavalry and dragoons, which I have in

this precaution, ſome events may happen next winter in my neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which will oblige me to recall all the troops which I have in the

the duke of Marlborough. It is of ſuch importance, that I cannot doubt
but you will intereſt yourſelf in its ſucceſs. I entreat you, my lord, to be

it appears to me, that it will be ſufficient for the execution of it, to
ſtation the Engliſh and Dutch cavalry in the places on the frontiers;
where, being under the direction of their own generals, they may be
eaſily recruited. This muſt have the leſs difficulty, with regard to the
Engliſh cavalry, that they have always had their winter-quarters in places
in Flanders which are not far from thoſe now in queſtion. It will be
otherwiſe with my troops, which, in ſuch quarters, will be no longer
under the inſpection of my generals, and will be too diſtant to receive
their recruits with facility; whereas, when my troops are placed in their
uſual quarters, I ſhall take particular care that their recruits ſhall be

without the concurrence of her allies; and, therefore, your Highneſs

would have been no difficult matter to have adjuſted the intereſts of the

to give your Royal Highneſs the greateſt proofs of her Majeſty's

weight of the war upon the Queen and her ſubjects, while one part
ſhifted off their own ſhare, and others thought of nothing but eternizing
the war; and in the mean time this nation was exhauſted, its burdens
daily increaſing, and the ability to bear them decreaſing: yet, in theſe

Royal Highneſs an account, at large, of all that has paſſed upon the

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0950500102:272"/>
which had been ſtamped about two years ſince, the Queen ordered the
perſons concerned to be proſecuted; and becauſe the Lord Advocate,
(to whoſe care it did belong) was not very forward in putting the laws
in execution upon this occaſion, the Queen has thought fit to remove
him, and to place Sir James Stuart in his room, who, I hope, will
quickly correct the imprudence of thoſe people. I ſhall only crave leave

might have been ſaved, and no one is ignorant of the ſtate of
the Emperor's finances, which indeed England has generouſly and
bountifully ſupplied. As her Majeſty finds now, the burden of this too
heavy for her people, it is not ſurpriſing that ſhe looks out for a remedy,
which I heartily wiſh may contibute to her glory, and to the good of her
kingdoms, and of her allies. But hitherto, it was always believed, that
the too great power of France would be prejudicial to them all, and
eſpecially to England. But you know this, undoubtedly, better than
I, who do not pretend to underſtand affairs of ſtate. With regard to
thoſe which are private, they will always incline me to be, with great

Sandy [Hannover], to demonſtrate to him that he is ſincere; and, in the
mean time, he does all he can, in order to get him to prevail, by all the
arts that he is capable of. Thoſe, he knows, look another way. He finds
ways to leſſen and diſcourage, and whatever they have is what he cannot
avoid. He would not have a clamorous complaint; ſo manages it with
dexterity. Your relations [the church party] ſee it, but cannot help
themſelves; for, on the other ſide, Mr. Willie [the Whigs] would ruin
them worſe; ſo that, to uſe a modiſh expreſſion, they are forced to hold
the candle to the devil, at preſent, and after a little time he will defy
them to hurt him, when the great deciſion is over.</p>
                  <p>Now to public news; I muſt inform you that the parliament, by the
votes which you ſee, have ſo expoſed the allies, that it is plain they do
not intend to have any more of the ſame dealings with them, and that a
peace is certain. The Portugal miniſter ſaid, at Somerſet-houſe, in
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0950500102:285"/>
public, that the parliament had called his maſter rogue and raſcal; but
that he was abuſed in good company, meaning the Emperor and the
Dutch. The Whigs croud after prince Eugene, and cabal with him
hourly; but it can come to nothing. The parliament is to go on the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
treaty: that will lay a great ſcene open. The duke of Marlborough
did not ſign it; but there is a letter of his, that proves that he ordered
my lord Townſend to ſign it. They ſay the two ſcored articles are,
that the Dutch ſhould have all the conquered towns from Cambray to
the other ſide for themſelves, and that they are to furniſh England with
30,000 men and 40 ſhips, for the loyaliſts of England to ſecure them.
The parliament will be judges of that deſign. The Queen declares they
did not let her read it, but ſaid it was approved of by the council, ſo
ſhe ſigned it. The article relating to Portugal is very diſhonourable for
England; they agreeing to have our fleet to attend them, on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
they thought proper for them. This makes a great noiſe, has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the Whigs more than all their other management, and left them
without excuſe. The birth-day of the Queen, the duke of Marlborough
was in a chair in St. James's Park, with the curtains drawn; the mob,
that believed it to be the prince Eugene, huzza'd the chair; but the
duke modeſtly drew back the curtains and put himſelf out, and with a
ſign ſhewed his diſlike to the ſalutation. The mob, finding their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
and that it was he, cried out, "Stop thief," which was a thorough
mortification to him. His daughters, that day, to ſhew their contempt
of the court, were in wrapping-gowns at a window in St. James's, to ſee
the company paſs, two of them, and the other two drove through the
Pall-mall four times, in the worſt mob-dreſs they could put themſelves.
The duke was in a black ſuit, that day, and his ſon-in-law, the duke of
Montague, was at court in a plain, coarſe, red coat, with a long ſhoulder-knot,
in ridicule of the day; but the Queen had the ſatisfaction to ſee
the moſt ſplendid court that ever was, and crowded more than ever, by
all the church, nobility and gentry. There was a ſhort uproar. My lord
Marlborough finds his levees much thinner than they were, and daily
leſs and leſs. The people are diſguſted at him. In a little time he will
be odious to them. How they huzza the duke of Ormond, who loves
popularity too well. Prince Eugene wears the ſword the Queen gave
him, ever ſince the birth-day; it is worth 6000 <hi>l.</hi> He has had his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0950500102:286"/>
from the third day he was here. The court wiſh him gone; but
my lord Oxford does not apprehend any thing from him. The Whigs,
ſince they miſſed ſending him to the Tower by their impeachment, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach him ſince the additional lords. They ſay there will be fix more
made. The Whigs cry out at the number that was made to ſerve a turn,
and ſay it deſtroys one of the three parts of our conſtitution; and made
the Queen and lords one, which ought to be two parts, and the commons
the third. Though it is in the power of the crown, the truſt is betrayed,
when uſed to deſtroy the power of parliaments. It cannot be imagined
how the votes that reflected on the allies have diſcouraged the Whigs; for
it has ended all their hopes of having the war continued. This news of
Braſette has been an unlucky ſtroke for the allies. The Scottiſh peers
will ſit no more; they have abſented themſelves theſe five days; declare
the union broke; and this of liberty for the church-clergy is directly
againſt the agreement. The Scots will prove themſelves the bribery,
and to whom the money was given to get it ſigned. There is nobody
made maſter of the horſe; it is in commiſſion, they ſay, till my lord
Strafford's return. The duke of Somerſet is not yet out of the bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
The lady Catharine Hyde is bed-chamber lady. My lord Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham
continues to work to draw ſome over to the flying party, which
he deſigned to ruin the lord treaſurer with; but it will not do. The
Diſſenters are highly diſſatisfied with the State-whigs, for betraying them,
as they call it. My lord treaſurer declares to them he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it, if he could; for certainly he is a friend to them, though an
enemy to the State-whigs, who would have ruined him and his country."</p>

prevented, at the time prince Eugene came, and the duke of Marlborough
was turned out of all his employments.</head>
                  <p>"THE whigiſh faction, being diſappointed in the execution of all their
black deſigns ſince their being turned out, induſtriouſly made uſe
of the Emperor's and Hannoverian miniſters (who were well prepared to
break off the treaty) to procure the averſion of the vulgar againſt a
peace.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſtep made towards it was, that the Emperor's miniſters hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acquainted baron Bothmar and the whigiſh faction, that he was well
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0950500102:287"/>
aſſured the Tory miniſtry intended to procure a match to be made, and
a marriage ſolemnized between the Pretender's ſiſter and the King of
Sweden; and that reſtoring the Pretender would be the conſequence of
ſuch a match; and that he is in the bottom of the preſent negociation for
a peace.</p>
                  <p>This was calculated for a bait to bring over the ignorant part of the
commonalty on their ſide, as Doctor Sacheverel's ſermon was ſerviceable
for the Tories, upon which enſued the late change of the miniſtry; and
accordingly Bothmar was prevailed upon to preſent the late memorial
to the Queen, who ſurreptitiouſly got it printed and publiſhed againſt the
ſitting of the parliament.</p>
                  <p>But finding it had not the deſired effect, they were reſolved to leave no
ſtone unturned, and accordingly preſſed prince Eugene's coming for
England, to lay before the Queen and parliament his maſter's mighty
propoſals, viz. that England ſhould have all the Weſt Indies, and a free
trade throughout all Spain, and that 90,000 men, at his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
proper charges, ſhould be employed wherever the Queen ſhould
appoint.</p>
                  <p>Theſe high propoſals put them in mighty hopes of prevailing with the
Queen, having the houſe of lords already prepared, the majority being
Whigs: but, on the contrary, the Queen and miniſtry were ſo averſe to
it, that, to balance the lords, ſhe made twelve new peers all of a ſtart,
whereby ſhe has eſtabliſhed a majority of the lords, as well as of the
commons, of her ſide for the peace.</p>
                  <p>But her Majeſty, finding the faction ſo earneſt for the prince's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
upon theſe occaſions, diſpatched a meſſenger to Holland, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his coming over, who miſſing him, by reaſon of his having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
before the meſſenger's arrival, and his being detained by contrary
winds for ſeveral days, it was thought neceſſary (in order to weaken his
pretenſions and diſcountenance the faction) to remove the duke of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough
from all places of truſt, which ſudden and unexpected change
quite broke all their meaſures.</p>
                  <p>The prince at his landing, finding things in this diſmal poſture, and
foreſeeing his fruitleſs errand, would expoſe him to a public ridicule, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
with his party to form another plauſible ſcheme of laying before
the Queen and both houſes, viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0950500102:288"/>
That his maſter had formed a new alliance with Holland, Pruſſia,
Denmark, Poland, the Czar of Muſcovy, Hannover, and the other princes
of the Empire, and all the Hans Towns, for ſecuring the proteſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
and if poſſible to bring his Swediſh Majeſty into the alliance.
But the miniſtry look upon all this to be only a deſign to get the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
again into their own hands, rather than a ſincere intention of
performing any better, than the laſt treaty has been executed on the late
Emperor's part; and accordingly rejected it.</p>
                  <p>Then little Eugene thought of another project, viz. To have the duke
of Hannover's ſon brought into England, wherein he is like to fail, as
well as in all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt not omit, how the party have premeditated and concerted
the manner of the reception of this little emiſſary.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to render him the more popular, and his errand the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
he was to be met by ſeveral thouſands on horſeback at his landing,
and conducted with great acclamations and huzzas through the city,
where great illuminations and ringing of bells was to be made, and the
mob to cry out, No peace, No peace; and then great and ſplendid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
were to be made by ſubſcription for him. All which fine
doings were timely prevented, by the vigilance of the miniſtry, who were
truly apprized of it.</p>

                  <p>"THE deputation of the city of Ghent in Flanders, repreſenting the
generality of that province, caſt themſelves at your Majeſty's feet,
and, with all reſpect and ſubmiſſion, ſet forth: That the glorious battle
of Ramillies, which was fought by the troops of her High Allies againſt
the French, had given us hopes of being freed from their tyranny.
Whereas general Cadogan, whom your Majeſty was pleaſed to appoint,
in the room of Mr. Stepney, for the general government, and my lord
duke, perſons who tread under foot the glory of your Majeſty and of all
the Engliſh nation, in that, in the year 1706, at the taking of the city
of Ghent, they immediately made an agreement, with the members of
that province, promiſing them their protection and continuance of it,
notwithſtanding they had ſerved the enemy, the French, which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and thereby reaped the benefit of the ſweat and blood of the
poor provinces of Flanders; my lord duke having got ſix thouſand piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toles,
and general Cadogan one thouſand in ſpecie.</p>
                  <p>After a regulation was forthwith framed, for the better direction of
the ſaid province, ſigned by the ſaid lord duke and the deputies of the
States of Holland, the 6th October 1706; but the ſame being to the
prejudice of thoſe perſons who were in offices, and whoſe perquiſites were
thereby ſomewhat reſtrained, they entreated the ſaid lord duke and Cado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to inhibit the ſame, which was likewiſe granted them, whereby Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogan
got for himſelf 40,000 gilders, out of the ſaid poor and exhauſted
province, which has been for ſo many years the feat of war, and ſupplied
with bad directors, who have made themſelves rich as Croeſus, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
impoveriſhed the province.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence which befel the High Allies, by thoſe infamous and
contribution-thirſty thieves, the lord duke and Cadogan, in their cauſing
the aforeſaid perſons to be continued in their employments, namely in
the magiſtracy, was, that in the year 1708, they contrived and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
the betraying the towns of Ghent and Bruges; the army of the
High Allies being thereby brought in the greateſt danger of periſhing all
at once. My lord duke and Cadogan, whether they had a hand in it or
not, agreed anew with the ſaid perſons in offices to procure for them a
general pardon, which my lord duke promiſed to obtain by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
as it alſo happened, notwithſtanding that the ſaid lord duke and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0950500102:290"/>
Cadogan were fully informed and knew themſelves the ſecret correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of our governors with the generals and miniſters of the enemy, as
alſo the perſons who contributed thereto; and for the ſaid general par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
the firſt got two hundred thouſand gilders, and the latter ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
piſtoles, all out of the remainder of the revenues of the ſaid ruined
province of Flanders.</p>
                  <p>The aforeſaid members or governors of the ſaid province have, not
long ſince, given to the ſaid Cadogan, the ſum of five thouſand piſtoles,
upon his promiſe that they ſhould be continued in their employments;
which ſum he has received at Bruſſels, in the houſe of the Sieur Vander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gote,
one of the council of ſtate, his great friend; beſides other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the ſaid council, who are enemies of the High Allies and protectors
of their enemies; and that was done at the time that our convoy was
beaten between Ghent and Courtray, in the pariſh of St. Eloyvive, when
inſtead of furthering the ſervice of the war, he preferred his own intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Over and above the ſeveral ſums, which he and my lord duke have
otherwiſe exacted from our poor province, we ſhall allege no other for
ſhortneſs ſake, this ſerving only to obſerve that they have continued ſuch
members in the magiſtracy of Ghent and Bruges, notwithſtanding they
had ſerved the French before, and had contrived and accompliſhed the
betraying of the ſaid towns, only thereby to continue to feed their ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
by extortions from the poor province, that thoſe perſons might not
diſcover to your Majeſty and parliament their thieveries.</p>
                  <p>The matter is come to that pitch, that her Majeſty having no opinion
of the conduct of thoſe two money-thirſty perſons, the duke and Cado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
they are capable to induce the aforeſaid members to give atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their good behaviour in having reaped no profits from this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
but, it is hoped, that your Majeſty and the parliament will have
no regard to them, it being certain, that one thief will not willingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
another; that is to ſay, that the ſaid lord duke and Cadogan, who
have procured to the ſaid directors of our province the amneſty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſaid treachery, will eaſily be induced to excuſe thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
them: and to diſcover the truth of what is above mentioned, that
her Majeſty will pleaſe to cauſe an inquiry to be made into the conduct
and roguery of thoſe two perſons during the war in the Netherlands, by
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0950500102:291"/>
ſuch members of the new parliament as have been employed under
them as officers in her Majeſty's ſervice.</p>
                  <p>We proſtrate ourſelves at your Majeſty's feet with all humility, that
your Majeſty will be pleaſed to reflect on the premiſes, and conſider the
miſerable condition, in which our aforeſaid province is involved by this
long war, and to deliver and free us of the ſaid lord duke and Cadogan,
two profeſſed thieves to our province and the reputation of your Majeſty
and the whole Engliſh nation, who are pleaſed to pay their troops and
officers ſo largely with their own money and never permitted that any of
their chief officers, as theſe two, ſhould enrich themſelves ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
with the money of our poor country, much leſs to protect ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
as ſhewed their affection entirely for the French, and ſtill correſpond
with them. There is ſo much of this, that all the favours they have
ſhewed to the enemy would be ſufficient to fill a book, the ſending of
money to ſuſtain the war againſt us being one of their leaſt favours.</p>
                  <p>We further pray your Majeſty to ſend another plenipotentiary to our
government, with expreſs orders, to turn out all ſuch perſons in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy,
who have ſerved the enemy, and to put in their room ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who are fit to ſerve your Majeſty and to eaſe our poor province.
As for ſecretary Laws, like maſters like men, of whom no good teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
can likewiſe be given. Wherefore, we pray, likewiſe, your Majeſty
to appoint another in his room; and, in ſo doing your Majeſty will find
plainly more proſperity in your arms, reſtore the reputation of the nation,
and further have the bleſſing of God Almighty, for having puniſhed the
bad, for which all ſuperiors are ordained. And in caſe your Majeſty is
not pleaſed to appoint other miniſters, in the room of Cadogan and Laws
as alſo my lord duke, who will better promote the glory of your Majeſty
and the reputation of the parliament and Engliſh nations, who muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
change the reſpective magiſtrates, as is uſual every year, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the cuſtoms and privileges of the country, we ſhall ſtill be
governed by, and remain under, traitors to your Majeſty and the High
Allies, who were ſerviceable to the enemy, and were put into thoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
and have now continued in them for four years together, which
if not remedied, we ſhould be happier to be governed by Turks than by
that Britiſh thief Cadogan. Relying on the protection of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>"I Have received yours of the 1ſt. I ſhall, ſince it is a ſatisfaction to
you, give you an account of all the public news that I hear. The
vote of the houſe of commons againſt my lord Townſend, for ſigning the
Barrier treaty, which declares him an enemy to the Queen and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
it is believed, will have no other conſequence, 'till after the peace,
but to give a latitude to our plenipotentiaries, to act on the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
terms they can, notwithſtanding that treaty. The death of the
Dauphin has put the Whigs in freſh hopes, that prince Eugene has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
to get it inſiſted on, that Spain and the Indies ſhall be the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's.
He cabals daily with the Whigs, in a very indecent manner; the
great project is, to have the prince of Hannover here, to noſe the Queen,
at leaſt; but their aims are further. The Dutch, Hannover, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
miniſters here, are laying a ſcheme for it, and have carried it ſo
far, that the command of the army, this Summer, is not offered to the
prince of Hannover, as was intended. The duke of Ormond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0950500102:295"/>
in Flanders, and is fitting up his equipage. The vote of the
Lords, which they got by ſurpriſe, the houſe being thin, and the Scotch
lords retiring, to make themſelves conſiderable, the Whigs carried it, and
addreſſed, with a deteſtation to the articles from France, though they did
not come judiciouſly before them; it was only to encourage the Dutch,
and Emperor, and Portugal, to inſiſt on great demands; but had no
weight here. The houſe of commons being zealous for the good of the
kingdom, out-balances all their tricks, and the miniſtry treat ſure and
gain ground daily. The ſcheme is only to expoſe and diſcourage, and
undeceive the kingdom; their puniſhment will be left 'till the peace is
finiſhed. It is my lord of Oxford's politics to ſmooth and check, and
would not have removed the duke of Marlborough, if it had not been
abſolutely neceſſary. The Hannover miniſter is highly diſpleaſed at an
accident that has happened; his letters he ſent by a ſervant, betwixt 11
and 12 to the general poſt houſe: at—, he was robbed of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and what little he had about him. The—will have it, our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
laid the deſign to come by his letters. It was not amiſs to find
what he and prince Eugene have been contriving with the Whigs. He
has had his anſwer, from the firſt of his coming, and has been told, by a
ſide wind, that the court is not ſatisfied with his ſtay, ſince he is ſo cloſe
in cabals with the diſſatisfied lords. He told him, that ſaid this to
him, that he knew that; but he ſhould do what was convenient to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
If he ſtays much longer, he will be ſent away, contrary to the
Queen's firſt reſolution. His nephew is taken ill of the ſmall pox; ſo
that gives a freſh pretence. The Whigs have ſo contrived it, that it
will be moved, at the congreſs, to remove the prince that is in France.
By the inſtigation of the Whigs, this is moved here, by prince Eugene,
in the Emperor's name, and that all the allies ſhall be guarantees for the
ſucceſſion of Hannover; but it is believed our plenipotentiaries have
inſtructions not to have any ſuch guarantees, which would limit the
people of England; for hereafter, in caſe of neceſſity, they muſt aſk all
the allies leave to chooſe a King, and my lord chief juſtice has declared
it treaſon in thoſe that ſigned the Barrier treaty. On that account, all
the people in the country have got the book which I hope you have,
called "The conduct of the late miniſtry and the allies;" and another,
"The obligations that the Dutch have to us." They are two books worth
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0950500102:296"/>
reading. They have ſet us in a right light, and have ſo exaſperated all
the counties of England againſt the late miniſtry and our allies, that
they are in ſome counties ready to addreſs the Queen, to puniſh thoſe
that acted in all their vile practices; and now the barrier treaty itſelf,
with remarks on it, is publiſhed, written by the ſame hand, which is a
very good one. They are approved and directed by my lord Oxford;
the Whigs anſwer them, but in that railing evading manner that has no
force.</p>
                  <p>My lord Marlborough is very humble, viſits every creature that has
any credit. To general Webb, he ſent to know, when he would be at
home, he would viſit him. He ſent him word, he never would be at
home to him; that he had done him all the injuſtice he could, when he was
in power, and that now he would do him all the juſtice he could, which
he thought he deſerved; and my lord Wharton told my lord treaſurer,
that he played well at whiſt. What he could not make by tricks, he
made up by knaves. The treaſurer anſwered him, that they believed
the game up before he took the cards, and had made tricks out of all the
knaves, let who would hold them; but he obſerved their game, and
ſhould be ſorry to be thought a bungler. The houſe of commons are
reſolved to throw Walpole out of the houſe again. He was choſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
but now they have lodged a petition againſt him. The Hannover
reſident took the liberty to threaten ſome of the leading members, with
his maſter's reſentment, if they pretended to meddle with the barrier
treaty, but did not deter them; but, as a jeſt, it is ſaid, the ſame mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
cauſed his ſervant to be robbed of his letters, to ſee what he had
writ of them. All here believe the peace certain. We have ſtrange
ſtories ſent from France, of the duke of Orleans being taken in the very
act of inceſt with his daughter, the dutcheſs of Berry, when he had
made her, and the lady the duke de Berry had a deſign of, drunk; whilſt
one debauched her, the other abuſed his own daughter; and that the
Dauphin was poiſoned; theſe ſtories are common; they were firſt told
by Madam Malous, the niece of the late lord Feverſham, who lives at
Somerſet-houſe, where prince Eugene is every night, at leaſt, three times
a week. She pretends to have letters of it from France. There all the
foreign miniſters are two or three times a week. Baron Bothmar, the
Hannover Envoy, daily ſhews his diſlike to my lord of Oxford, and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0950500102:297"/>
does his maſter great prejudice by it, and has turned the court againſt
his proceedings. Prince Eugene is angry, that——put
in his advertiſement by way of jeſt: a reward for any that could bring
the names of theſe fifty perſons, his mother the dutcheſs of Bollin poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.

                  <p>The truth of the following anecdotes is, in ſome degree, aſcertained by
collateral proofs. The marquis de Torcy, in his memoirs, mentions
them, with corroborating circumſtances; and he was not a writer, that
advanced facts upon mere ſurmiſes, being a man of integrity, intelligence,
and abilities. The Stuart Papers of the preſent year are full of anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes
of the ſame kind; and the miniſtry, by the precautions they took,
ſeemed to have been convinced, that dangerous conſpiracies were formed.

the Duke and prince Eugene againſt the Miniſtry.</head>
                  <p>
                     <date>April 10, 1749.</date>—"MR. Eraſmus Lewis told me, that at the latter
end of 1709 or beginning of 1710, Queen
Anne ſent for lord Somers, and told him, as they were alone, ſhe having
an opinion of his judgment and impartiality, deſired him to tell her his
opinion of the Duke of Marlborough. He ſaid he would; and told her
that he was the worſt man that God Almighty ever made; that his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
was boundleſs and his avarice inſatiable; and that he had neither
honour nor conſcience to reſtrain him from any wicked attempt, even
againſt her perſon, as well as againſt his country, &amp;c. Somers (as the
Queen was weary of the d—ſs) expected to be made firſt miniſter, but
was baulked. The Queen had expreſſed herſelf advantageouſly of his
honour, integrity, and capacity. During the debates about the peace, in
oppoſition to it, M. de Torcy acquainted lord Oxford, that after the
Duke of Marlborough had hindered the peace of 1706, when it ſhould
have been made, he had treated with the French court to make them one,
and was to have two millions of crowns for it. This would have been
done, but for M. Chamillard, a weak miniſter, who during the ſiege of
Liſle, came to Valenciennes, ſent the duke of Marlborough word, that
he expected he would raiſe the ſiege of Liſle, as a proof of his ſincerity in
the peace they had treated and ſettled. The duke of Marlborough was
angry, and wrote to the duke of Berwick, that there was an end of the
affair, and he would have nothing more to do with the treaty.</p>
                  <p>When M. de Torcy diſcovered this, the King of France allowed lord
Oxford to make uſe of it, to ſend the duke of Marlborough abroad; but
inſiſted that his life ſhould not be touched; and ſo it was. They had a
meeting at Thomas Harley's houſe, in James ſtreet, Weſtminſter. Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
coming to the ſtreet door, in his coach, the duke of Marlborough in
a chair to the garden door opening into the park; it was then reſolved,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0950500102:299"/>
that the duke of Marlborough ſhould go abroad. Prince Eugene and
lord Wharton both ſaid, on the occaſion, that the duke of Marlborough
had not a clear conſcience, or he would not have ſubmitted to that
ſtep.</p>
                  <p>Several meaſures were propoſed to oppoſe the peace, and ſeveral
ſchemes ſent to Vienna; ſome for ſeizing the Queen, others for ſeizing
the miniſtry, and one for aſſaſſinating Oxford and Bolingbroke in their
chairs. Prince Eugene wrote about this laſt, to count Zinzendorff, then
at the Hague; who wrote, in anſwer, that ſuch meaſures were extremely
hazardous, and ſcarce to be undertaken; but if this was reſolved on, he
adviſed prince Eugene to come over to Holland, before it was executed.</p>
                  <p>Among other ſchemes, one was for the duke of Marlborough, by his
power, as general, to aſſemble 2 or 3000 men, at an hour, in different
ſquares of Weſtminſter, and to ſeize St. James's. This was diſcovered,
and lord Oxford ſent to Mr. Lewis to come immediately to the office,
that morning, his preſence being neceſſary by ten o'clock. When he
came, he found the lord chancellor and all the lords of council there.
The buſineſs was to ſuperſede the duke of Marlborough's commiſſion, as
general, under the broad ſeal. There had been before an order under
the privy ſeal ſent him not to act more as general; but his commiſſion
being under the great ſeal, could not be ſuperſeded, but by a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
under the great ſeal. When this was done, the duke of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
would not act ſo againſt law, as to rendezvous the men: he was
not made for hazards.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid, the duke of Marlborough's quitting the oppoſition to the
peace, had ruined his credit at Hannover and at the Hague. King
George was reſolved to make no alteration in miniſtry, but 40000 <hi>l.</hi> given
to Bothmar, at the Hope, cauſed the duke of Marlborough's apology to
to be accepted, and all Queen Anne's miniſters to be turned out<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>Eraſinus Lewis, was under ſecretary to the Earl of Oxford. He is often mentioned by doctor Swift, in his letters. Swift charges prince Eugene with the deſigns mentioned in the two laſt articles<note n="§" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the four laſt years of Queen Anne, p. 76 of vol. xvi.</note>; but biſhop Burnet<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of his own times, vol. iv.</note> and the Whig writers ſpeak of him in a very different manner.</p>
                        <p>The Marquis de Torcy relates, in his Memoirs, that he had his maſter's orders, to offer four millions of livres to the duke of Marlborough, at the Hague, in 1709, if he employed his intereſt in contributing to a peace<note n="‡" place="bottom">vol. i. p. 299.</note>. His Majeſty's words are, <q rend="inline">"I don't in the leaſt queſtion, but you avail yourſelf of the opportunities you have of ſeeing the duke of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, to let him know, that I have been informed of the ſteps he has taken, to hinder the progreſs of the conferences of peace, and even to break them off entirely; that I had been the more ſurpriſed thereat, as I had reaſon to believe, from the aſſurances he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given, that he was willing to contribute to this end; that I ſhould be glad his conduct was ſuch, as to deſerve the reward I have promiſed him; and in order that you may be able to come to a clearer explication, I am willing you ſhould give him a poſitive aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that I will—In ſhort, I am willing you ſhould offer the duke of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough four millions, ſhould he enable me to keep Naples and Sicily for the King, my grandſon, and to preſerve Dunkirk with its fortifications and harbour, and Straſburg and Landau, in the manner above explained, or even the ſame ſum were Sicily to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted out of this laſt article<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 391.</note>."</q>

what I am aſked, I will tell you the thought of our houſe and partners.

their frolic,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">month </seg>March.</label> is difficult to ſay; it is talked, as if Mr. Diederick Hamilton
[Hannover] was to come hither, aſſiſted by couſin Jaſp and party [the
Dutch]; and to countenance his coming, Mr. Jaſelin's relations [the
houſe of lords] are waiting a favourable opportunity to give him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation.
Be it by this, or what other means ſoever, Mr. Matthew Judd
[the Low Church] begins his work; it ſeems abſolutely neceſſary too,
that Mr. Lours [the King] ſhould be upon the place as ſoon as poſſible,
to take care of his own effects; his aunt Suſan [Scotland], if one may
believe her, will give him a moſt hearty welcome; and though ſhe cannot
advance much money for carrying on of the ſuit, yet his adverſaries will
probably be no better ſupplied; every body being unwilling to venture
in the preſent ſtate of things, in which there are hardly three perſons, how
long ſoever friends, who would be able to take council together. In
ſhort Mr. Lours [the King] will undoubtedly provide himſelf the beſt he
is able, and for the reſt <hi>Deus providebit.</hi> There is a report here, as if
he intended to make a journey to ſee his kinſman Obedia Townſend [Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy

great way off. But it is time to tell you ſomething of our public matters.
The occaſional-bill, whatever miſery might be intended by it, has not yet
raiſed any ſtir, nor gives the leaſt appearance of doing ſo. Prince Eugene,
beſides his feaſting from houſe to houſe, has propoſed very little buſineſs;
and, if he thinks fit to ſtay a month longer, in the ſame way, will be as
little mentioned as any enſign in his army. Our court keeps ſtill its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
for peace, in which it is backed by the houſe of commons; but
the Tory majority in the lord's houſe is but ſmall, and by the abſence of
ſome of them, they are now and then trapped in an odd vote. In a little
time, we ſhall ſee what is to be hoped for, as to peace; and as that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
or goes back, our parties ſhape their hopes. Pray my ſervice to

                  <p>Mr. Menzies, ſo often exhibited under the feigned name of Abram
is the Scotch gentleman mentioned by Monſieur Menager, in the account
of his ſecret negociations in England.</p>
                  <p>Menager having ſigned the preliminary articles of a ſeparate treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
France and Britain, employed the time he ſtaid afterwards in
London, in attempting, according to his inſtructions, to render ſome
ſervice to the court of St. Germains, and introduced the ſubject in a
converſation with Mr. St. John. They foreſaw, that the King of
France would be obliged, in the enſuing treaty, <q rend="inline">"not ſo much to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the chevalier, as to acknowledge the ſucceſſion of the crown in the
houſe of Hannover, as it was mentioned in the ſecond preliminary<note n="*" place="bottom">Minute of Monſicur Menager's negociation.</note>."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Menager propoſed that a ſecret article ſhould be made by the Queen,
to diſengage the King from all the obligations of ſuch agreements upon
ſuch ſubſequent occaſions as might happen; and a declaration from her
Majeſty, that all the engagements the King ſhould enter into in the
treaty of peace, ſhould be ſo underſtood by the Queen. St. John was
afraid the Queen would not ſign ſuch a declaration; but he thought ſhe
would declare, by word of mouth, that ſhe would be ſatisfied to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the treaty in ſuch a manner; and that whenever ſhe diſengaged the
King from it, the obligation on him, as to the recognition of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
ſhould ceaſe. Bolingbroke mentioned this propoſal to the
Queen; and, with her conſent, introduced Menager to Mrs. Maſham,
that he might learn her Majeſty's intentions from that lady, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
did not chooſe to meddle further in the affair.</p>
                  <p>Two points were agreed upon between Menager and Mrs. Maſham:
Firſt, <q rend="inline">"that, for the ſatisfaction of the people at home, and the allies
abroad, the King ſhould be required, in the Queen's name, to abandon
her brother and his intereſt, on pretence of adhering to the ſucceſſion as
it was now eſtabliſhed."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>2d. <q rend="inline">"That nevertheleſs, this ſeeming to abandon the ſaid intereſt,
was to be ſo underſtood, that the King ſhould not be obliged, in caſe of
her Majeſty's deceaſe, not to uſe his endeavours for the placing the ſaid
prince on his father's throne, to which he had an undoubted right<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 276.</note>."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0950500102:304"/>
Mrs. Maſham told him, <q rend="inline">"that it was the preſent unhappineſs of the
Queen to poſſeſs the throne of her brother, which ſhe had no other claim
to than what the political meaſures of the ſtate had made legal, and in a
ſort neceſſary; which, however, ſhe believed, gave her Majeſty often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſecret uneaſineſs: that this was not all the misfortune, but that,
by the ſame neceſſity of ſtate, ſhe was obliged, not only againſt her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
but even againſt her principles, to further and promote the
continuance of the uſurpation, not only beyond her own life, but for
ever. That I might be ſure, under ſuch circumſtances, it would be an
inexpreſſible ſatisfaction to her Majeſty, to ſee herſelf delivered from the
fatal neceſſity of doing ſo much wrong; and if it could be poſſible, with
ſafety to the religion and liberties of her ſubjects, to have her brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to his right, at leaſt, after her deceaſe, if it could not be done
before."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"That it was true the Queen did not ſee through this; and it ſeemed
next to impoſſible, <q rend="inline">"the rage and irreconcilable averſion of the greateſt
part of the common people to her brother being grown to ſuch a
height:"</q> nay, ſhe ſaid, the Queen found it would be impoſſible to
enter upon any treaty of peace, or ſo much as to let the people hear of
putting an end to the war, without entering into the ſtrongeſt engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
poſſible for the confirming the ſucceſſion in the houſe of Hannover;
<q rend="inline">"a thing that I am ſure, ſays ſhe, is all our averſions;"</q> and we have
no retreat but to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, in hopes of his ordering
things ſo at this treaty, that he may be at liberty to ſupport and aſſiſt in
the work, whenever an opportunity ſhould preſent itſelf: that, to this
end, the plenipotentiaries from hence, <q rend="inline">"though there was no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
any thing to them by way of confidence,"</q> ſhould be inſtructed
not to inſiſt upon things more than neceſſity obliged; and <q rend="inline">"ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
ſure," ſays ſhe, "may be made, to leave room for juſtice to take
place in time to come<note n="*" place="bottom">Minute of Monſieur Menager's negociation, <hi>p.</hi> 282.</note>."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Menager, upon his arrival at Utrecht, where he acted as one of the
plenipotentiaries from France, found that the Britiſh miniſters had not
received the private inſtructions which lady Maſham gave him reaſon to
expect would be ſent to them; and he afterwards diſcovered, that
the agents of the court of St. Germains had made the concerns of
the chevalier the ſubject of a private negociation with the miniſtry in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0950500102:305"/>
England. Theſe agents were obliged, at laſt, to write to the King of
France <q rend="inline">"in plain terms, that the miniſtry in England were men of no
honour; that they had held them in ſuſpenſe for a long time;
and that now, they not only did not come to the point with them,
but declined any converſation on the ſubject; only ſaid in general,
that a certain perſon would be ſent over to Utrecht, who ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
by word of mouth freely, and ſhould ſettle that affair ſo as ſhould
be agreeable to all parties<note n="*" place="bottom">Minute of Monſieur Menager's negociation, <hi>p.</hi> 305.</note>."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lady Maſham, in a letter to Menager, dated St. James's, March 2,
1712, ſays, <q rend="inline">"I take it for granted, that they (the court of St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains)
are fallen into the hands of my Lord Treaſurer: he loves a ſecret,
and is famous for making intricacies, where there is a ſterility of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues;
and no leſs renowned for cauſing every thing of ſuch a nature
to miſcarry. If their aſſurances are from him, I doubt not, he values
himſelf upon having deceived them; and if the perſon to be ſent to
Utrecht comes from him, I dare promiſe you, that when he comes there,
he wants his inſtructions<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 310.</note>."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Menager, who hated all the agents of the court of St. Germains, and
was equally hated by them, ſays, that <q rend="inline">"all this was owing to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
and jealouſy of the court of St. Germains, who, though the
King had agents of his own in London, who, perhaps, did their utmoſt,
yet they at St. Germains, being uneaſy, could not refrain ſending a ſecret
embaſſy themſelves. This, it ſeems, was a Scotchman, who pretended
great intereſt with a Scotch lord, who was an officer of ſtate in England;
but either the meſſenger failed in the intereſt he pretended to have, or the
Scotch nobleman failed in what he promiſed to do for him; ſeeing the
ſum of his negociation was briefly this; that after a long ſtay, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
only there two notable exploits, viz. firſt, that he ſpent a great
deal of their money; and ſecondly, that he ruined and expoſed the buſineſs
which he was entruſted with; and at laſt, came away with nothing but
an empty promiſe from the ſaid Scotch lord, that a perſon ſhould be ſent
over to negociate that matter with the French and Britiſh miniſters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 314.</note>."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Menager had ſtrong prejudices againſt the earl of Middleton. He
gives the poſtſcript of a letter he wrote to lady Maſham. <q rend="inline">"A Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0950500102:306"/>
from St. Germains, and a Scotchman in your court, have been the
agents to deceive one another, and to abuſe their maſters. As to the
inquiring who the ſecret has remained with, they confeſs now, at St.
Germains, that it has really remained with no body: for ſo ill a choice
did they make of their agent, that he has not only expoſed his errand
but his employer: and our people in London are very free to ſend word
hither how ill he has acquitted himſelf; though, by the way, I muſt
obſerve, that this was not done till after they had been amuſed with the
perſuaſions of this perſon, to believe things were in a good train, when
they were indeed in hands who intended nothing leſs than to perform
what was propoſed<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </p>
                  <p>Menager's account of this negociation appeared ſo extraordinary, that
it hath hitherto met with little credit from the public; but it will be
found to coincide with what relates to Menzies, under the borrowed
name of Abram in Nairne's letters, and with the account which the well
known John Plunket gives of his own intrigues. He acknowledges,
that he allowed himſelf to be amuſed with promiſes by the earl of Oxford.</p>

would be friends if they could find a way to ſhow it. But he
cramps all, and makes each man afraid to appear inclined to the intereſt

the firſt nobility can get an audience, but with the utmoſt difficulty; ſo
that he will govern this affair, I mean the peace, and certainly intends
to make up with Hannover, although at preſent they differ. But, after
all Hannover's attempts have failed, he will be glad to make up with
Harley. But the beſt part of the gentry, and half the nobility, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to have the King; the parliament would do it in a year, if it
could be believed he had changed his religion. They would not impoſe

                  <p>"MR. Arnold's letter to Nelſon [Middleton], of the 4th, O. S. came
ſafe, with Berry's incloſed, which was delivered to Pleſſington
[the King] and Wiſely [the Queen], who deſired me to tell Berry, that
they were very glad to hear he had ſeen Mr. Armſworth [Marlborough].
They are fully perſuaded, that he is now very ſorry that he has not ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
their advice, in compounding their debts, whilſt he had ſufficient
effects in his hands; but it is the misfortune of very many juſt men to
let themſelves be over-ruled by pretended friends, who have different
views. However, pray ſee him as ſoon as you can; and you may very
truly aſſure him of the friendſhip that Goodall [the King] has for him,
the confidence he has in him, and the aſſiſtance he expects from him;
for, though his affairs are in a low condition, by reaſon of his loſſes at ſea,
yet his prudence and experience may be of great uſe; and his ſubſtantial
aſſociates may put him in a condition to appear again on the Exchange,
and eſtabliſh his credit on a ſure bottom. But it is very natural for Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington
[the King] to expect to hear from him, to know by what ways
and means, when and how he deſigns to do him juſtice.</p>
                  <p>'Squire Young [princeſs Anne] is ſo entirely in Goldſmith Baker's
[Harley's] power, that we cannot tell what judgment to make of him.
Manning [the King of France] knocks under the table; ſo that we muſt
ſhift for ourſelves. Nothing but want of bread can make us go to Mr.
Deane's door, being ſenſible that would be the greateſt miſery that could
befal us. I am confident that Gurney [Marlborough] and Gilburn [Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphin]
will be grieved at heart to ſee our preſent diſtreſs, and uſe their

                        <p>"THE Queen having ſome aſſurance, that, at this treaty of peace,
her jointure will be allowed her, or rather a penſion equivalent
to it, her deſign is to make uſe of your aſſiſtance in the receiving of it;
but that matter not being yet ſettled, ſhe is not willing to have it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
ſpoke of, or to ſay any thing further relating to it, than to conſult
about a form for a letter of attorney, or power to authoriſe you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty conſiſts in this, how to avoid owning the government
in what ſhe ſigns herſelf, and yet not to offend it: ſo that to compaſs
theſe two points, and yet make the inſtrument valid, is the matter you
are deſired to adviſe with ſome judicious council about.</p>
                        <p>Should the Queen ſtyle herſelf Queen-mother, ſhe ſuppoſes, that will
not be allowed; ſhould ſhe ſtyle herſelf Queen-dowager, that would be
a leſſening of herſelf, and a prejudice to the King her ſon; which ſhe
will never do.</p>
                        <p>The question is, therefore, whether the inſtrument may not be good
without any title at all, only the word "We"; (for in as much as it will
be ſigned Maria R. and ſealed with her ſeal, one would think the perſon
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0950500102:314"/>
would be ſufficiently denoted); but if that be not ſufficient, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any other expreſſion can be invented to the intent mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Our council here think ſhe might ſtyle herſelf thus: "Mary, Queen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
of James the Second, late King of England, Scotland, France, and
Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c." to all unto whom theſe preſents may
come, ſends greeting, &amp;c.; and ſo go on according to the form here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed.
In fine, you are deſired to adviſe about this matter, and ſend the
reſult, as ſoon as with convenience you can, that her Majeſty may not
be to ſeek in ſo material a point, when the time comes to uſe it.</p>
                        <p>If the incloſed form, upon other accounts, be improper, pleaſe ſend a
draught of ſuch an one as is thought ſit; and, if it muſt be drawn upon
ſtamped paper, pleaſe to ſend a ſheet or two alſo.</p>
                        <p>Her Majeſty is to allow you two hundred pounds a year, as a ſalary
for this trouble, beſides all incident charges, and is ſorry her circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
will not permit her to make it more conſiderable; however, is
deſirous that what advantage was to be had by it, it ſhould be given to
you, preferable to any other perſon, as a mark of her Majeſty's ſenſe of
your conſtant zeal and fidelity in her ſervice."</p>

King of France; he is ſent by Mr. Harley and the cabinet-council; his

Rotterdam, you muſt not take notice he is Mr. Plunket, but call him
Rogers to the merchant, Mr. Hacket, who does not know him. I need

in your new employment, though the occaſion of it was diſmal to
all; and you cannot imagine how generally ſhe is lamented, even by
thoſe, that have ever been enemies to her family. I and mine have
ſhared ſo in your loſs that we thought our ſorrows could have no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when we heard your Chevalier was recovered; but now we find
our miſtake; for, ſince we had yours to my daughter Jeany, 'tis ſaid at
court he is deſpaired of, and on the Exchange that he is dead; that he
eat too much meat, and got a cold with going out too ſoon. If this be
true, all honeſt people will think no more of this world; for ſure never
was mortals ſo unfortunate as we. You may gueſs at our condition;
which, by the worſt of natures, would be pitied. Your doctor gave us
hopes, laſt night, there was no good grounds for ſuch reports; but whom
to believe, or what to think, our concern is too great to know; but every
moment we are either going or ſending to inquire for comfort, but find
none yet. Pray Heaven this day gives us ſome, for the wind is fairer for
it. I beg you will make my condoling compliment, for to write it my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to your only miſtreſs is tormenting her now; but pray aſſure her I
grieve for her loſs, and the ſenſe I am ſure ſhe has of it, to a degree not
to be expreſſed, but felt with true affection and duty, and to yourſelf and
partner all love and faithful ſervice from Bob and me, who begs he may
be remembered when you make my compliments; for he is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
than ever I ſaw him.</p>

This is to acknowledge the receipt of two of your letters. I would
have writ laſt poſt for my mother; but ſhe was ſo well ſhe would write
herſelf. I do not queſtion but you muſt gueſs at the concern my ſiſters,
&amp;c. were in, when we received the news of your loſs; upon my word
I was ſtupified with it, and cannot ſtill help being anxious about the
brother's health, notwithſtanding your aſſurances of his recovery; for
we have ſo many cruel reports about him, that it is enough to make
one diſtracted. Pray aſſure his afflicted mother of my moſt humble
duty. God in heaven ſend her comfort, for ſhe wants it; nothing but
her goodneſs could reſiſt ſuch a ſtroke. We are all well and entirely
yours. My ſiſter deſires you would make her compliments, as ſhe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely

Take my word, all is right, and will ſoon bear. All his friends are
earneſt for his changing his lodgings, and rejoice he is to leave France.
I confeſs it ſtrikes a damp ſometimes upon me; but I muſt ſubmit to his
lawyers, who know beſt what he is to do. Alas! I was to-day to have
ſent him a pacquet from his friend, but he has delayed it till I hear again.
O! what is my dear angel doing at this time? He repreſents himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to me as my bleſſed ſaviour. Men and angels cannot tell the
heart I bear to him. I hope God will pity me, and preſerve him.
I know that is all that is wanting, and that you will ſoon ſee. I
hope you are to go with him to his new houſe, and pray God for
it; it will put me out of all my ſenſes, if I do not often hear of you
and from him; and, to be ſure, nobody will be ſo kind and ſo careful as
I now find you are. I thank you ten thouſand times. For God's ſake,
continue it to me. Is he not my all on earth? It is like a mill-ſtone about
my neck to keep me from writing him. If we do not hear any more bad
news, we will write on Friday, and I muſt beg of you to repreſent E.
M—r's faithful duty to him, and tell him, I am ſure he would give
500 guineas, at this moment, for a thing he promiſed: he ſaid it was
both for his own ſake and mine, and he does this day pity me at
his heart. I have no eyes in my head, but that which look like red
blood. We parted about an hour ago. He kept the firſt illneſs from
me, till I had yours. When I had yours of the 3d, I was for coming to
ſee him, and roared and cried I would do it; and I told him I would
not deſire to ſtay but four days with him, and I would be back before
his affairs wanted me; but E. M—r told me, the world could not
ſave my life, I would die before I was two days journey. I ſaid if I

died coming back I did not care, but I was ſure I would not die in the
going; the joy to ſee my dear angel would ſupport me. All my friends
in general were againſt it; but it was to E. M—r I was to ſubmit.
I had intereſt enough to have come the ſhort way. I truſt in God I ſhall
ſee him ſoon, and give me the ſatisfaction to aſſure him of my humble

ever her eyes ſaw; for it reſtored her to life, after being dead
about a week, but not to perfect health, for her dear Lowder [the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs];

ſubmit to the will of God; the world is his, and he may do in it what
he pleaſes. We ſee Kings and princes have their afflictions, as well as
our poor families; and a little time will bring us all together again. I
hope you have ſeen the gentleman (Mr. Sheridan) I recommended to
you. He is a worthy man; I ſent a book or two by him, but have not
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0950500102:322"/>
heard from him but once, upon his firſt getting to Amſterdam [St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains],
and he could not then tell me how to direct to him, and he
knew not I had writ to you concerning him, and may neglect going to
you; but if you hear of him at the Exchange or otherwiſe, pray ſend for
him, and let him know this, and that his friends are in pain for him, not
hearing from him, nor knowing how to write to him. It was by his
means I recovered two of the books the old woman [Mrs. Traveller]
left behind her, elſe I had never got one of them. Let him know I writ
to Allen [my lord Middleton] concerning him; incloſed to you, I writ
of others matters, but have had no anſwer from him ſince; ſo he is a
letter in my debt: I pray my hearty ſervice to him and good landlady
[lady Middleton], and tell him, his houſe at Putney [the peace] is near
finiſhed and will be ready for him; and if he has any further commands
for me, let me know them. You are conſtantly remembered at the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
with ſincere reſpect and kindneſs. Ned ſhewed me yours of the

England]; ſo that is to be explained. Is Mr. Emerton [F. Eyre] ſtill
at his houſe in your town, or gone to Toruine [Liege] where he lived
before? His leaving off trade, at this time, for himſelf, is of great ſervice
to his maſter, and I doubt not, he did it very willingly, in which I have
done him juſtice here; from what I know of him myſelf, I have really
a great value for him, and would let him know it from myſelf, if it
would be worth the poſtage; therefore, pray do it for me. My kind

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0950500102:323"/>
writ another myſelf ſince, but have had no returns, which makes E. M.
uneaſy. He longs for your opinion of the circumſtance of your law-ſuit;
he believes 'tis all for your good and advantage, in all points, and is very
angry with me that I cannot be content; and then he will tell me, if it
were to ſave Mrs. Ord's [Queen Anne] ſoul from death, ſhe could not
proceed otherwiſe, nor faſter. Your friends do not know this, and they
come every day with ſome new ſtory to me. But my joy is, that you are
ſecure, on all hands, as E. M. tells you in his laſt. Scotland is always
ready, but I am ſure it will be England that will have the firſt honour;
but all your friends may ſubmit to that, for I am at my old ſaying,
Welcome Turk, Jew, and Infidel, to help to end that long law-ſuit;
and I dare ſay it will end in great joy and friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>The parliament is out of town, and will not be in town till Monday;
and, for that reaſon, E. M. is out of town for a few days; but deſired
me, if I had any letter from you, to ſend an expreſs for him. I need not
tell you how he longs for his preſent, although he ſays, he has no doubt
of ſeeing the original in a ſhort time. I am ſure he takes true pains for
it, and this is doing him juſtice. All your friends and correſpondents
may do that piece of right, to own it is he of all the Scots has the beſt
intereſt with Q. Anne and E. Oxford; and alſo he is believed by the
Engliſh as a good and great lawyer, and a man of much goodneſs and
honour. If he was not my kinſman and dear friend, I would ſay much
more; but that I can juſtify. His being a faithful attorney to you, is
perfection enough to make him happy in this world and in the next; a
good conſcience is the world's eaſe; and I am ſure, 'tis a great eaſe to
my poor heart, to ſee the friendſhip of your creditors increaſe every day,
and it will bring you with eaſe to town, when your debts will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
and I am well informed not to be uneaſy at your leaving
France. It is the ſafeſt way to bring you to your own; and that you
are not to ſtay long in any ſettled place till then, only tour about till
your debts are near paid; and the parting word between E. M. and me,
when he went to his country-houſe, was to beg me to chear up my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
I ſhould ſee my beſt beloved, and that he would then tell all my
faults. So the Almighty God permit it me, is my poor and hearty
prayer. Yours, &amp;c."</p>

                  <p>Firſt, by founding Mr. Simſon and his aſſociates for ſeveral months
together, not perceiving in them a real diſpoſition for an agreement with
Mr. Maine [King of France], with an inclination to do juſtice to Mr.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0950500102:325"/>
Jenkins [the King], with ſafety to themſelves; but the current running
too ſtrong againſt them, for ſuch an attempt, at that time, they reſolved
to take a year or two's time to ſtem it, though they knew it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to the prejudice of the ſiſter and all her tenants, the ſaid Rogers
[Plunket] conceiving they wanted but a plauſible handle to juſtify ſuch
proceedings, reſolved to procure them one if poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, being intimate as well with Mr. Goodman as with all
thoſe that were entruſted by him, he became maſter of all their ſecrets,
and of the methods that were taken to prevent the ſiſter from entering
into any accommodation with Mr. Maine [King of France], in order to do
Mr. Jenkins [the King] juſtice, and produced the vouchers from time to
time to Mr. Simſon, whereof he got as many as were ſufficient to juſtify
the ſiſter's [P. Anne] making a ſeparate agreement with Mr. Maine
[King of France]. Upon which ſhe took courage, and made a firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to treat with him at all hazards; whereupon, Rogers [Plunket]
was pitched upon, as an indifferent man, to deliver a meſſage to Mr.
Maine [the King of France] to that purpoſe. But, upon ſecond thoughts,
he being found more uſeful and capable of rendering further ſervice here,
Mr. Simſon ſent another that was a creature of his own; but, in the
meantime, Mr. Maine [the King of France] ſent hither one Mr. Ciprian,
in order to try the ſiſter [princeſs Anne] and Mr. Simſon's pulſes, which
Mr. Rogers [Plunket] communicated to Mr. Simſon, wherewith he
ſeemed to be well-pleaſed, whereby a true underſtanding was ſettled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, which has been the foundation of the preſent agreement
between them.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Williams's maſter [prince Eugene's], having a dark notion of the
matters, and conceiving them to be much to his detriment, came hither
by the inſtigation of the Wylens [Whigs], in order to fruſtate and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all abortive, coſt what it would; wherein he was ſo deſperate as to
form a deſign of laying violent hands on the ſiſter, rather than he ſhould
be diſappointed of his ends; but Mr. Rogers [Plunket], being vigilant
upon this occaſion, found means to diſcover all his intrigues; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
communicated the ſame, from time to time, to Mr. Simſon
and his aſſociates, which put the ſiſter [princeſs Anne] upon a reſolution
of cloſing immediately with Mr. Maine [the King of France] and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a good correſpondence with him for the future, in order to do Mr.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0950500102:326"/>
Jenkins [the King] juſtice, upon occaſion; whereby it is in Mr. Maine's
[King of France's] power to give the reſt of his adverſaries what terms
he pleaſes, about which we ſhall not diſpute much with him.</p>

                  <p>"YOUR laſt letter has given me a great deal of concern, becauſe I
do believe it had been of great conſequence to the cauſe in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
that you ſhould have ſettled the accounts with Mr. Rogers. He
could have told you what the beſt counſellors had ſaid to him, upon his
laying the merits of the cauſe before them, Mr. Tom Weſt [lord Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave]
who is a friend to Mr. Jenkins [the King] told Mr. Roger
[Plunket] that what he had informed him of, would do Mrs. Beſs Smith
[England] the greateſt ſervice that had been done her ever ſince the ſuit
began, (which has been theſe twenty odd years), and Mrs. Beſs Smith
[England] has very nobly rewarded him for that ſervice; for it has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0950500102:329"/>
covered Mr. Sandys's [Hannover's] practiſes, and laid them open, which
would have ruined Mrs. Dibby [princeſs Anne] who abhors him now.
Mr. Rogers [Plunket] did believe, that young man [Mr. Sheridan] was
ſent by Mr. Peregrine [Ferguſon] to Mr. Jenkins [the King], becauſe
Mr. Peregrine [Ferguſon] did acquaint Mr. Tom. Weſt [L. Mul.] of
Mr. Rogers's buſineſs, unknown to Mr. Rogers; for he had taken mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
to have it laid before the friends in Mr. Medlicot's family [the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament];
and the pleading firſt council [cab. coun.], both at a time,
when he found Mr. Hans [Harley] concealed all from them; but when
Mr. Peregrine [Ferguſon] had taken that way, Rogers was ſatisfied,
though he was not privy to the doing it, for it had the end he wiſhed;
and in a little time it will be laid before Mr. Medlicote himſelf [the
parliament], though he is very tender in openly expoſing Mr.
Sandys [Hannover], becauſe of the tenants love to him yet; but
all the others, that are injointly with him, will be openly expoſed,
which will juſtify Mrs. Beſs Smith [England] acting apart from them;
a greater ſervice could not be done to Mr. St. John [the King] than this
has been. Mr. Tom Weſt [lord M.] has been informed, that Mr.
Wealy of the country of Mr. Peregrine [the Scots Whigs] has ſent to
Mr. Sandys [Hannover] to aſſiſt him againſt Mr. Carres [Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land],
and deſired him to come to them; therefore, now Mr. Carres has
no better way, than by Mr. Jenkins [the King] to do himſelf juſtice;
and that is what he is reſolved on. But the many difficulties he muſt go
through, is what they are labouring under, becauſe of the jointure Mrs.
Dian Johns [princeſs Anne] has upon the eſtate; and after her death
it will be too late, becauſe of the entail that will then take place. Mr.
Peregrine would have had Mr. Rogers to have let him have managed it;
to have a friend of his to have come to him, to ſettle the accounts, and
ſaid, Mr. James Staff [Mr. Stafford] would, he believed, come himſelf to
ſettle the accounts with Mr. Rogers [Plunket]; but he having given
Mrs. White direction to write to you, he would not alter that; ſo that
he will be diſappointed extremely, becauſe, for many reaſons, he cannot
do it, by writing at a diſtance; beſides, you may gueſs how impoſſible it
is to direct you, by writing all the particulars of what he would let you
underſtand, for he knows a great deal of the affairs of the entailed
eſtate. He ſaid, he did not acquaint the young man [Mr. Sheridan] of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0950500102:330"/>
any thing, not believing him a proper perſon; but Mr. Peregrine hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done that to Mr. Tom Weſt [lord Mulgrave], he believed, by the
young man's going of a ſudden then, away he had ſent him; but Mr.
Rogers has no patron [cut paper], and cannot get the work done any
other way, effectually; ſo you will not have the work. I fear he is,
what I told you, expecting Mr. Sam Hamey [Sir William Ellis]; he will
write to him: Mrs. White gave him a direction how to write. He,
poor man, is in danger in that ill air, conſidering his weakly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
ſo he will ſtay as little a time as he can; but he has much to do,
being fully apprized of his buſineſs, from the firſt hands. I believe there
could be nothing of greater uſe in the cauſe, than your ſending this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with him; but ſince that, you ſay, cannot be done, pray write to
him, and let him know the reaſon, and tell him how you think it ought
to be done. Direct for Mr. Rogers as you ſend Mrs. White's, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to him by Mr. Hacket; ſo you and he muſt do it the beſt way
you can; the term is now, and it will be a great damage to thoſe you value
moſt, not to know how to inſtruct the counſel. Your friend Mr. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews,
tells me, that he has writ to you. He is now in Mr. Medlecot's
family [Scotch parliament], and that more than half of thoſe children,
wiſh us well, as he does the proſperity of your couſin St. John [the
King]; but they were deceived in this laſt affair, in relation to Mr. Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins
[the King] by Mr. Hans [Mr. Harley], and hate him heartily for it;
But you know, they muſt take no notice of it, but are reſolved to make
what reparation they can, and as ſoon as they can do it. Mr. Peregrine
is ordered to receive 100 <hi>l.</hi> for laying the buſineſs of Mr. Rogers before
the lawyers [cabinet council]. Mr. Tom Weſt [duke of Buckingham]
has got it done, on that account, by Mrs. Debby's [princeſs Anne's] direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

you ſhall have as they come to hand. But I am afraid they will not give
you that light into the matters as I could give you by word of mouth:
as for the gentlemen at Utrecht, I ſhall not trouble my head much about
them. If Mr. Jacob [the King of France] and his ſubſtitutes don't think
it worth while to be fully appriſed of the ſervices that have been done
for him, this year and three quarters paſt; I don't know why he ſhould
be courted to it. He may thank Mr. Jenkins [the King], or he ſhould
not have found matters go ſo well to his mind as they do; for I can tell
you, from the very mouth of the greateſt one at the helm, in England,
that they would not dare cloſe with Mr. Jacobs [King of France] with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thoſe papers; nor could Mr. Jenkins's ſiſter [princeſs Anne] be
brought to any thing, if ſhe had not them laid before her, and have we

ſpirits, and told me, that they had nothing elſe that could bear water,
but the papers which I have been procuring for them all this while, with
the hazard, not only of my own, but other gentlemen's lives, beſides
other expences I have been at? It is true, at preſent, and eſpecially here,
I am handſomely allowed, in the laſt letters I had from London, that I
gave them greater light into affairs than they have had yet, and were
pleaſed to return me hearty thanks for it; but I cannot do that ſervice
I would or ſhould for Mr. Jenkins [the King] or Jacob [the King of
France], if I have not the aſſiſtance of ſome body, to communicate from

                  <p>"I Don't imagine I ſhall be able to leave London as ſoon as I propoſed.
The Whigs continue always to ſow the feeds of diviſion, by form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new projects for deſtroying entirely, if poſſible, the party now in
power, and they flatter themſelves much, to accompliſh this the more
eaſily, that the treaſurer, who is at the head of it, is univerſally hated,
that is to ſay, by both parties; conſequently, no one will regret him.
It is for this reaſon they urge me to ſtay for ſome time longer, in order
to ſee what their projects will come to. I ſhewed them again, that they
would have the ſame ſucceſs with the former, and that my ſtay would be
of no advantage to them, as my preſence ſerves only to four the minds of
the miniſtry; and, in order to diſengage myſelf the more from them,
I communicated to them the ſentiments of the Grand Penſionary, upon
the clauſe which I ſent to you, in my diſpatches of the 25th and 29th of
January. They anſwered me abruptly; and among the reſt, the Duke
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0950500102:334"/>
of Marlborough, that the grand Penſionary had changed his ſentiments
very ſoon, ſince he began to be apprehenſive of diſobliging a handful of
factious members in the houſe of commons, and to be afraid of a miniſtry
who are penſioners of France, and conſequently enemies to the common
cauſe, and will continue ſo as long as they ſubſiſt. It ſeems to me, that
the States have already forgot, that they formerly reſiſted France and
England at once; and if I am not miſtaken, they will find themſelves
ſoon in the ſame neceſſity. <q rend="inline">"Yes," ſays baron Bothmar, "of ſending
thither the prince of Hannover, as they ſent the prince of Orange, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the nation and to prevent the ruin of the common cauſe."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They urged me inſtantly to ſend you the following particulars to be
added to thoſe, which I ſent you in my diſpatches of 25 and 29 of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,
and to make up a memorial of them, to be printed there firſt, as it
might then be printed here without any ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>The Queen of England upon her acceſſion to the crown, declared
the following particulars.</p>
                  <p>That trade being the ſupport of the nation, and ſhe having religion
ſo much at heart, had made no difficulty of engaging in this war,
though the nation was then in debt, being well convinced, that ſhe could
not be ſecure upon the throne, while Spain was in the poſſeſſion of the
houſe of Bourbon; and ſhe had engaged herſelf deeper in this war than
ſhe had at firſt propoſed, to the great detriment of her kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>But the meaſures of the preſent miniſtry ſufficiently ſhew, that they
were not hearty in the cauſe from the beginning, and that the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſee very well, that every thing tends to a ſeparate peace, and to
pave the way more eaſily for her brother. I told them, that appeared
very probable; but that the Penſionary would ſtart the ſame objections,
as baron Bothmar did not think proper to undertake ſuch a delicate affair
without communicating it to his maſter; and that it is now too late to
produce any great effect, as the people in England were already biaſſed
by the reſolutions of the houſe of commons; but the junto made the
following anſwer: <q rend="inline">"by this method of proceeding, we ſhall never ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
for you made the ſame objection to the loans which we had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
from the bank and from rich merchants, by engaging the revenue
of the kingdom of Hungary, and other hereditary dominions; and by
that means, the Emperor would find himſelf in a condition, jointly
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0950500102:335"/>
with the States-general, of beſieging a town, and at the ſame time, taking
the field, by which, of conſequence, he would put an end to the ceſſation
of arms, and infallibly break up the conferences at Utrecht, and diſpoſe
the people to believe all the projects that might be formed. I imagine
we have ſtill time enough to inſert this in the memorial."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwered them, that we were fooliſhly employed in building the
tower of Babel, for there are not three among you or us of the ſame
ſentiment. Sometimes you would chooſe to have the prince of Hanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and ſometimes you would not; and I ſee that the greateſt number of
you are for an ariſtocracy; and what vexes me moſt is, that you have
obliged the Emperor to make demands, from the greateſt part of which
he will be obliged to deſiſt."</p>

How far this will be conducive to Mr. Jenkins [the King's] intereſt, or

                  <p>"What is more evident than that Craſſus [Hannover], with the Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
[the Dutch] and the Tartars [Whigs], have declared againſt Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
[Queen Anne] and his lawyers [miniſtry], and that there is no means
to ward that blow but by doing juſtice to Richard [Pretender]? One
muſt want both ſenſe and manners to miſtruſt ſuch eminent perſons; and
it would be as abſurd to inſtruct them in the ways and means of manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a matter ſo neceſſary for their own ſecurity, and the advantage of
their pupil Canaan. As for inſtance, would it not be a ſtrange preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to tell them that delays are dangerous, that if Thomas [Queen
Anne] ſhould die, whom God preſerve, Craſſus [Hannover] muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
get poſſeſſion, becauſe the decrees made in his favour, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
could never in that caſe be reverſed? That Richard is a perſon of
too much ſpirit to ſubmit, but would immediately appear armed, with
equity, and ſupported by many good friends and relations, to aſſert his
right; ſo that the eſtate in debate would be utterly ruined, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
lawyers [miniſtry] could not eſcape the rage of Tartars [Whigs];
and that though Croeſus's [Marlborough's] caſe be not ſo deſperate, yet it
cannot be doubted but he wiſhes he had made better uſe of his time.</p>
                  <p>That the ſureſt way to prevent theſe miſeries, is for Thomas [Queen]
to ſend a letter of attorney [treaty] to his brother Richard [Pretender];
and when that is ſigned, to call him home immediately, when the troops
[parliament] are diſperſed in their reſpective quarters: that this merry
meeting muſt be at Sir Roger's [London], to make it more ſolemn and
ſecure, by ſurpriſing the Tartars [Whigs] in their head quarters, by a good
guard of Janiſaries [Tories]: that thoſe who never had a good
thought of Richard [Pretender] would crowd to embrace him, and tell
him, as they did his uncle, that it is the happy day they all wiſhed for:
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0950500102:339"/>
that when the troops [parliament] were aſſembled, and the brothers
ſhould appear together, they, no doubt, would not only applaud what
had been done, but would make a ſecure title to the eſtate: that it would
be dangerous to begin with the troops; for, beſides the caſe of mortality
already mentioned, they are fickle and humourſome; and even the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries
themſelves are jealous of one another.</p>
                  <p>That there is more prudence, and as much courage ſhown in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
danger, than by running into it: many great occaſions have been
loſt by too much caution; whereas, by ſtealing a march the ſecret is
kept, and the enemy found unprepared: that for that end and purpoſe,
Richard [Pretender] ſhould be as advantageouſly poſted as can be, to
prevent Craſſus [Hannover] in caſe of the worſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations, and many more, would be ſuperſluous to be

my ſilence hitherto; but if Mr. Hall's health could have permitted

corrupt. I was ſorry to find, by yours of the 19th, to Moncrief, that
the King was kept ſo much in the dark; for, though we are ſo here, I
did not doubt but Queen Anne had explained matters fully, with relation
to the King of England, to the King of France, and he to his Britannic
Majeſty. Will not you ſend me a new addreſs, and I ſhall explain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
I aſked one from Leſly, who gave it, but I durſt not uſe it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
upon account 161, or hope or hobby. But what is ſaid now is
more to try if it comes ſafe, than any thing elſe: oppoſite to 113 ſet
Abbé Gaultier, or Colſton.</p>
                  <p>If 231 is not, I am indifferent to other things: compliments are not
neceſſary, where deeds ſhall give conviction of fidelity. If the King of
France remembers 33, he will not refuſe the duke of Hamilton; and he
hopes that the King of England will intereſt himſelf for him, and the
Queen likewiſe. The duke of Hamilton has been much preſſed to go
ambaſſador to Vienna; but lately inſinuations have been made to him,
as if they would ſend him to Philip after the peace; but he did not chooſe
to engage himſelf in any thing, until he knew the King's ſentiments upon
it; he will do in that what he thinks fit.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">month </seg>July.</label> as I truly love him, and deſign him my heir, notwithſtanding
the difference of religion; but alſo from the great difficulty of giving an
opinion, where I do not well underſtand the law. Yet, that I may
leave nothing undone, I muſt ſay it is my opinion, that the chief matter
is to regain my brother's [princeſs Anne's] good liking. I ſhall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
mention ſuch ſteps as I think Harry [the King] may beſt take to
pleaſe his uncle [princeſs Anne], and, at the ſame time, get the good will
of the old ſervants and tenants, who I find in general much better
inclined to Harry [the King] than to his couſin [Hannover]. You
know the firſt diſlike my brother [princeſs Anne] took, was upon Harry's
[the King's] changing his religion; though, as I have often told him, it
was no more than he might expect from the manner of ſending him abroad;
for I did not think ſo very young a man, indeed you know he was a very
boy when he went, ſhould be truſted altogether to his own conduct, and the
event hath ſhewn my fears were not in vain. Yet my brother [princeſs
Anne] will not ſo much as own any imprudence, far leſs any fault, as I
think it, in this management; and whenever I touch upon this ſtring, I
can very ſeldom get any other anſwer, than, <q rend="inline">"You ſee he doth not make
the leaſt ſtep to oblige me. I have no reaſon to think he values me or my
eſtate, and therefore I am reſolved to give it to Dick [Hannover]."</q> Once,
indeed, I was obſerving to him, that my couſin Richard [Hannover] fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
abuſed his beſt ſervants; that he often ſhewed very little reſpect
for himſelf; that he ſeemed to me, by his behaviour, to think it not
in his power to alter the will he had made; and that, underhand, he
gave him all the obſtructions he could in the management of his eſtate,
for no other reaſon, that I could ſee, but becauſe he could not put what
ſervants he had a mind about him; that, for my part, I ſhould not think
it ſafe to have ſervants near me recommended by a perſon of Dick's
[Hannover's] temper; and that Harry [the King] never offered anything
like this. I am ſenſible this made a very great impreſſion on my brother
[princeſs Anne]; for he replied very haſtily, <q rend="inline">"What wouldſt have
me do, Jack [lord Mulgrave]; you know, as the law ſtands, a Papiſt
cannot inherit; and, therefore, ſhould I alter my will, it would be to no
purpoſe, the law would give it all to Dick [Hannovr], and therefore I
had better do that with a good grace, that I cannot help."</q> I told him
then, I believed Dick [Hannover] himſelf was no better than a Papiſt:
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0950500102:344"/>
that I had good grounds to ſuſpect him, for I never ſaw him at church
in my life, nor did I ever hear he went thither; and certainly a Papiſt
was better than one of no religion at all. I then ſaid, that I had been
told, that, by deeds of truſt, and by other devices, the lawyers often
found means to evade the act of parliament; and I do not doubt, but if
he would give good fees and good encouragement, the law would ſpeak
whatever he would have it: that the lawyers never ſuffered an act
to be made without a loop-hole to creep out at, and I believed it was
ſo in this caſe. Beſides, brother, ſaid I, you know Dick hath not the
reputation of being the beſt huſband in the world: but, added I then,
this his wife's behaviour too well excuſeth; yet, at the ſame time, give
me leave to tell you, brother, this doth not ſo much commend your ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
ſince it is plain you have no certainty that Dick's children
are his own. This made him very uneaſy, and he ſaid upon it, <q rend="inline">"you
muſt not believe all that is reported upon that ſubject. However, be
that as it may, I do not ſee how I can undo, what I myſelf have done,
and done in ſuch a manner: Harry [the King] may thank himſelf for it.
He knows I always loved him better than Dick [Hannover]."</q> I could
not think it proper to preſs further at this time, but rather choſe to leave
him to his own reflections on what had paſſed, and, in the mean time, I
will conſult ſome good lawyers what can beſt be done in ſuch a caſe. I
am convinced, that if Harry [the King] would return to the church of
England, all would be eaſy; nay, for what I know, if he would but
barely give hopes he would do ſo, my brother [princeſs Anne] would do
all he can to leave him his eſtate. I am ſatisfied he hates Dick [Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover],
and loves Harry [the King] now rather better than ever.</p>
                  <p>I was in the country about a month ſince, and could not but be pleaſed
to ſee how almoſt all the tenants careſſed me; on my conſcience, it was
for Harry's [the King's] ſake, whoſe part they know I always take. Old
Tom Simmonds [lord Mulgrave] told me a thouſand ſtories of Dick
[Hannover], and ſwore when his leaſe was up, that he would not renew
again, if Dick [Hannover] had the eſtate. Ah! Maſter, ſaid he, if
Maſter Harry [the King] was not a Papiſt, we would ſoon give Mr.
Richard [Hannover] his belly-full of law; we would all turn tenants to
Mr. Harry [the King], and ſee whether Mr. Richard's [Hannover's] an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities
would hold out againſt ſuch an eſtate; i'faith he ſhould have
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0950500102:345"/>
enough of law before he ſhould ſet a foot here. You certainly remember
old Tom [lord Mulgrave]; he is worth, at leaſt, 5000<hi>l.</hi> which he hath
got by his own induſtry; and I verily believe he ſpeaks the hearts and
minds of his fellows.</p>
                  <p>By what is above, you will pretty plainly perceive my [lord Mulgrave's]
opinion, and I would have Harry [the King] remember he is not the
firſt of his family who have thought a good eſtate worth changing an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for, and ten thouſand pounds a year is a pretty thing for a young
fellow to play withal; but if his ſcruples are ſo very ſtrong, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
go this length, let him endeavour to try to make his uncle [princeſs
Anne] believe, at leaſt, that he is in himſelf deſirous to come back,
but is aſhamed, left the world ſhould think he changes his religion for an
eſtate, which he will hardly get quietly, if at all, without it. Pray tell
him this in the ſtrongeſt terms, and that I myſelf [lord Mulgrave],
though my fondneſs makes me overlook it, would be very glad that he
was of my opinion; much more, he may well think, is expected by my
brother [princeſs Anne], who is, and ever was, very obſtinate in all his
opinions: if, therefore, Harry [the King] can prevail upon himſelf to do
as much on his ſide as I will do on mine, I by no means deſpair of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading
my brother [princeſs Anne] to conſent to let him go live on the
eſtate in Yorkſhire [Scotland] where he hath moſt friends; and when he
is once there, the reſt will ſurely follow at my brother's [princeſs Anne's]
death, who I muſt tell you by the bye, notwithſtanding his care to hide
it, I can perceive to be ſo infirm, that it well behoves Harry [the King] to
be ſpeedy in his reſolutions, left Dick [Hannover] ſhould, in that caſe,
get into poſſeſſion before him, which, by the help of God, he ſhall never
do, at leaſt without a law-ſuit; but then Harry [the King] muſt join,
or nothing effectual can be hoped for. Pray give him my kind love, and
deſire him carefully to conſider his old uncle's advice, and to take this with
him, that I find he can hardly depend upon the tenants aſſiſtance, whilſt
he continues the opinion he is of; and that whoever tells him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
deceives him; my aſſiſtance and firm friendſhip he may be moſt ſure
of at all events, and in all circumſtances. Tell him likewiſe, and I have
pretty good means to know it, that my brother [princeſs Anne] and his
beſt ſervants are now ſo angry at Dick's [Hannover's] late inſolence, that
if Harry [the King] will but put it in their power to help him, they will
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0950500102:346"/>
do all they can for him; and I do not know but my brother [princeſs
Anne] may go ſo far as try his intereſt to get an act of parliament to
ſettle the eſtate on him, which, in my conſcience, he hath friends enow to
obtain, if he will go heartily about it. Adieu. Love me as I do you."</p>

a proof of the zeal and induſtry of the perſon who collected them, and

ground viſibly, and the calumnies which they continually throw on the
Queen and miniſtry, with the utmoſt efforts of malice and impudence,
have little effect on the body of the people, who heartily long for peace

Whigs do all they can to poſſeſs the people with a notion that there are
evil deſigns on foot againſt the ſucceſſion; and they are even malicious

Chevalier de St. George; but there is nobody ſimple enough to give ear

who is dying, and poor Sanders [lord Somers] who cannot live long,
and is already dead in effect, to the great grief of Harry [Hannover]

think they will make any great venture; or if they ſhould, I hope we may
be able to turn it to ſome profit in our way; for, indeed, the ſtruggles and
endeavours they and Mr. Diederick Gould [Hannover] have hitherto made,
have been very uſeful to us, and brought our buſineſs into credit; ſo
that I have often thought we have as good ſervice from thoſe that do not
love us, as even our beſt friends. What buſineſs Mr. Stephen Coſen
[Mr. Thomas Harley] may be employed in to Mr. Diederick [Hannover]
I cannot ſay; but I am very much miſtaken if it be at all complied with,
be it what it will, ſuch is that gentleman's temper and preſent humour.
You will wonder when I tell you, that Mynheer Klaas [the King of France]
begins to come into good buſineſs, and to be mentioned in the city, as a
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0950500102:349"/>
very honeſt man, and a fair dealer. The giving up his intereſt in Mr.
Barty's houſe [Dunkirk] to accommodate his friends Mr. Ezekiel White
and partner [the high-church party] has given him great reputation, and
will ſo eſtabliſh his trade here, that our old correſpondents [the Dutch
and the reſt of the allies], will either be obliged to come into it, or we
ſhall leave them to themſelves, if not worſe. I muſt not forget to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you how great ſatisfaction Mr. Kreely's [King of England] ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
of late, has given here: friends and foes all ſpeak of it, tho
to different purpoſes; the event, however, is infinitely to his ſervice.
Thomas Harriſon [lord Somers] and Mr. Noy [lord Rivers] are both
dangerouſly ill, and their recovery much doubted; but though theſe
gentlemen were conſiderable in their way, yet I ſhall be much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for what becomes of them, than I am for the death of honeſt Mr.
Nicho's wife [captain David Floyd]: her diſtemper was the jaundice, to
which ſhe had been ſubject ſeveral years; but it increaſing of late upon
her, ſhe went down to the Bath, where ſhe died the ſecond of this month,
O. S. and was buried there the 4th. I tell you theſe circumſtances for
the ſake of their young relation with you, who it is fit ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it; but the manner of doing it I leave to your prudence
and good nature. Certain it is, ſhe was a moſt excellent woman; and
applied herſelf to every relation, and in every circumſtance of life, with
a cheerfulneſs and conduct which I know not where to equal amongſt all
my acquaintance. You will pleaſe to give my hearty ſervice to the
young gentleman, and tell him the reſt of his friends are well, though in
great grief, as is very juſt. I am, Sir, to you and the whole family, a moſt
ſincere and humble ſervant,</p>

                  <p>"I Wrote you three letters by Deſborde's addreſs; and having had no

way of Rotterdam, to let you know that young Ciprian is ſtill at the
Hague, and don't come near me, but gives out he is come on purpoſe to
ſpeak to me. I did let him know the ill conſequence of his ſtaying at
the Hague, and of his idle talk at this time. Pray ſend to him to go
back from whence he came, and by no means let him go for England;
you cannot imagine what prejudice it may be to Mr. Jenkins' [the King's]
affairs: he is not in the leaſt fit for buſineſs, and eſpecially of moment;
he is known to be ſuch in London. Henceforward you will ſee the effect
of our labour theſe two years paſt; and it will be found in a little time,
that we laid a good foundation to bring home Mr. Jenkins [the King].
If you would but recover the papers I ſent, you could eaſily gueſs how

hands in that country. It appears, by their diſcourſe, they did fall into
their hands. The Whigs in England loſe ground every day; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
it, they openly give out, they will make ſuch another attempt as
the Tories did in 88. Their friends in this country will give them all the
aſſiſtance they can; the rather, becauſe they ſeem well aſſured the fleet
and the army are not well-affected to the Queen and preſent miniſtry;
and conſequently will ſide with that of Marlborough and the Whigs on
this occaſion. This is what hinders the Dutch and the allies from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>The Tories laugh at what they can do or ſay, and ſay they do not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
the Dutch nor the reſt of the confederates. How theſe great feuds
and animoſities will end, time will ſhew. Mr. Jenkins' [the King's]
friends are for having him declare himſelf of your ſtamp, that they may
have a handle to declare for him, and exclude his competitor or rival.
I ſend two letters to my lady Litcot by Mr. Jacobs' friends [King of

upon other occaſions,<note place="margin">Nairne's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, vol. ix. 4to. p. 47.</note> ſhould be ſo very nice upon his account with ſo
honeſt and ſo fair a dealer as Pleſſington [the King], who will give them
all the ſtrongeſt aſſurances their hearts can deſire, that his inſeparable
partner Cotton [Catholic] ſhall never moleſt their friend Roſs [religion];
but, on the contrary, that he will be a truer friend to all Edward's [Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land]
family, but moſt eſpecially to Cary [church of England] than ever
Harper [Hannover] can be. It is natural enough for Cary [church of
England], to wiſh Pleſſington [the King] would marry in his family; but
it can never be thought reaſonable or friendly to preſs him to that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
For any thing of that nature, that is either done or may ſeem to
be done by force or intereſt, can never have that good effect that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of mutual union and confidence; and, therefore, I can hardly
believe that any that wiſh Pleſſington truly well, will ever preſs him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon marriage, or upon parting with his friend Cotton [Catholic R.],
who is ſo harmleſs a creature that he has neither power nor intention to
diſturb in the leaſt any of Cary's family [church of England]; for, if
Pleſſington ſhould comply with any ſuch propoſal at this juncture of
time, it would only ſerve to leſſen his credit, even with thoſe that
require it of him; for, if they will not truſt his word now, when they
ſee nothing but firmneſs, integrity, honour, and ſincerity in him, they'll
certainly have much leſs reaſon to truſt him, when they ſee him turn
away ſo ſlightly, a poor friend that he has been bred up with, for they'll
either think he is very weak or very inſincere, and in either of theſe
caſes, they'll have reaſon not only to diſtruſt him, more than they do
now, but even to deſpiſe him. But I hope Young [princeſs Anne], and
Baker [Harley], and Price [the parliament] (if they have any good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
towards their relation) will find a way to make both themſelves
and him happy, without being uneaſy to him upon this nice point."</p>

court of Hannover. The Elector ſent back a written anſwer by
him, and authorized his own miniſter, the baron de Bothmar, who had
come over with the duke of Marlborough, on the 18th of November
1711, to deliver a long memorial to the miniſtry. It was publiſhed in
the Daily Courant of the 5th of December, and gave great ſatisfaction
to the Whigs, but very great offence to the Tories; and the miniſtry
charged Bothmar with eſpouſing a party, and intermeddling very unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
in the affairs of Britain. Dr. Swift throws ſome light on this
ſubject, in his Hiſtory of the four laſt years of Queen Anne.</p>

                  <q>"It was the misfortune of his Electoral Highneſs," ſays their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and advocate, "to be very ill ſerved, by Monſ. Bothmar, his envoy
here; who aſſiſted at all the factious meetings of the diſcontented party,
and deceived his maſter, by a falſe repreſentation of the kingdom, drawn
from the opinion of thoſe, to whom he confined his converſation. There
was likewiſe at the Elector's court a little Frenchman, without merit or
conſequence, called Robithan; who, by the aſſiſtance and encouragement
of the laſt miniſtry, had inſinuated himſelf into ſome degree of that
prince's favour, which he uſed in giving his maſter the worſt impreſſions
he was able of thoſe whom the Queen employed in her ſervice, inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the preſent miniſters were not in the intereſt of his Highneſs's
family; that their views were towards the Pretender; that they were
making an inſecure and diſhonourable peace; that the weight of the
nation was againſt them; and that it was impoſſible for them to preſerve,
much longer, their credit or power."</q>

It is certain, the Elector, who had hitherto affected to be a friend to
both ſides, or, at leaſt, to be attached to neither of the parties which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the nation, diſcovered different ſentiments this year, and might be
conſidered as at the head of one of them. The miniſtry ſent over in the
beginning of the year Mr. Thomas Harley, a couſin of the earl of Oxford,
accompanied by Mr. St. John, brother to the ſecretary, in order to remove
whatever prejudices might have been infuſed into his Highneſs againſt
their proceedings, and to perſuade him to come into their meaſures. Mr.
Harley ſtaid long in Holland, and did not arrive in Hannover until the
12th of July.</p>
               <p>The Queen, in her ſpeech to both houſes on the 6th of June, expreſſed
herſelf in this manner: <q rend="inline">"The aſſuring the proteſtant ſucceſſion, as by
law eſtabliſhed, in the houſe of Hannover, to theſe kingdoms, being
what I have neareſt at heart, particular care is taken, not only to have
that acknowledged, in the ſtrongeſt terms; but to have an additional ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
by the removal of that perſon out of the dominions of France,
who has pretended to diſturb this ſettlement."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But neither Mr. Thomas Harley's declarations and remonſtrances to the
Elector, nor the Queen's aſſurances to her parliament, nor the profeſſions
of attachment contained in the prime miniſter's letters, could reconcile his
Highneſs to the meaſures which were purſued in Britain; or perſuade
him, that the miniſtry were well affected to the ſucceſſion in his family.
He was particularly alarmed, by a reſolution of the commons againſt the
Barrier treaty; whereby they declare, that, under pretext of ſecuring the
proteſtant ſucceſſion to the crown, and a barrier to the States, many articles
had been inſerted, in the treaty, deſtructive to the commerce of
Great Britain, and diſhonourable to her Majeſty. When Mr. Hampden
moved, that an addreſs ſhould be preſented to the Queen, that ſhe would
be pleaſed to give particular inſtructions to her plenipotentiaries, that,
in the concluſion of the treaty of peace, the ſeveral powers, in alliance
with her Majeſty, might be guarantees to the proteſtant ſucceſſion to the
crown of theſe realms, as ſettled by act of parliament, in the illuſtrious
houſe of Hannover, the houſe rejected his motion; and reſolved, that
they had ſuch an entire confidence in the repeated declarations her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
had been pleaſed to make, of her concern for aſſuring to theſe
kingdoms the proteſtant ſucceſſion, as by law eſtabliſhed, that they could
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0950500102:359"/>
never doubt her taking the proper meaſures for the ſecurity thereof.<label type="milestone">

reſolution of the commons increaſed the Elector's ſuſpicions of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
               <p>The baron de Bothmar had returned to be the Elector's envoy in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and his plenipotentiary at the treaty now negociating at Utrecht.
The baron de Grote was ſent in November to be his envoy extraordinary
in Great Britain. Bothmar, Grote, and Bernſdorff, preſident of the
council, and Monſieur de Robethon, ſecretary for the embaſſies, being
privy counſellors to the Elector, give one another, in their letters, the

ſtill hoping for ſomething agreeable to fill my letter, and make it
worth your reading. At laſt, I imagined the opening of the parliament
would have furniſhed me with ſomething I might have enlarged upon;
but the violence of their proceedings, on one ſide and t'other, makes a

party, not well know what to write, eſpecially ſince they write me from
London, that Monſ. Bothmar has now declared himſelf of the Whig-party;
ſo that my finding fault on that ſide, would be oppoſing the ſentiments

by an act, they ſhould have made proviſion for their ſpeedy coming after
the demiſe of the Queen, they found out, on the contrary, an expedient
to lay the foundation of a republic, by inveſting, by act of parliament, the
ſovereign power in certain places of which they were themſelves maſters,
and by their behaviour thought to have kept for life; all this inſtead of
making it high-treaſon for any one to do any act of ſovereignty between
the demiſe of the Queen and the coming over of the ſucceſſor, as was
propoſed by ſome of the Tory party, who, to my knowledge, and as I'm
an honeſt man and a Chriſtian, deſigned to have voted an allowance fit
for the preſent maintainance of a ſucceſſor, and told me when I was in
England, they were ſure of the Queen's conſent. I believe I mentioned
this before to you; but matters are ſince changed. I cannot tell what to
ſay. Is it permitted me, Madam, to remind your Royal Highnes of the
diſcourſe I have formerly had the honour to have with you on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
when you uſed to blame extremely the conduct of poor Monſ.
Shuts, for declaring ſo violently of one party? Did your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
not uſe to tell me, that a prince ſhould ſtrive to be a prince of his
people, and not by eſpouſing a faction give diſtaſte to two thirds of his
ſubjects; eſpecially a ſucceſſor, who is called in to the ſucceſſion, by both
parties, whoſe ſucceſſion both parties were to maintain, and whoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
always meets with the greateſt oppoſition from thoſe who have
now the folly to range themſelves on t'other ſide? You were pleaſed,
Madam, ſometimes, to tell me, that you ſaw the nation eſtabliſhed in
the proteſtant ſucceſſion for the good of itſelf and poſterity, and not out
of affection to your perſons, who the greateſt part of the nation knew
not; that you were ſure that very reaſon alone would ſupport your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
and to meddle in intrigues and parties could only create perſonal
and party diſtaſte, and make oppoſition to your ſucceſſion, which elſe could
never happen, as long as the reaſon and motive, which induced the nation to
ſettle the ſucceſſion on your family, ſubſiſted. But I hope theſe idle ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
the public hear of Bothmar's ſiding with the faction, are falſe like
many others; for I know inpartiality temper is the character of the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
and I muſt do Monſ. Bothmar that juſtice, that here I found him
extremely impartial and temporate. I knew upon the firſt bringing
over the general points, he objected the words The Proteſtant, had
been better than The Preſent Eſtabliſhment. I told him, that certainly
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0950500102:361"/>
the laſt expreſſion was the ſame as the firſt; for the preſent eſtabliſhment
of the ſucceſſion was that in the Elector's family. I told him, I believed
they didn't juſt hold to the old beaten words, being they would have
theſe preliminaries appear entirely general, in every point, that none
could take it amiſs, and that it might not appear as reſtrained as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
were; and, therefore, they avoided the ſame words. That, if he
had nothing elſe to aſſure him of the ſincerity of the intentions of the
miniſtry in favour of the proteſtant ſucceſſion, though all their lives and
actions have ſhewn, that is their firſt principle, yet they would not have
choſen the biſhop and me, being they knew both our principles, and
that we had both the honour to be perfectly known to your court, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
myſelf. Bothmar ſeemed ſatisfied with the diſcourſe and aſſurances
he had from me, whilſt I had the honour of ſeeing him alone; though,
after the duke of Marlborough came hither, he was ſo often taken up in
his Grace's company, I had not the ſame opportunity of converſing with
him, which I was ſorry for, being Monſ. Bothmar is one I had always a
perfect eſteem for; and ſhould have been glad of his aſſiſtance to have
advanced in my negociations the intereſt of your moſt illuſtrious family."</p>

pleaſed to make amends, by the long obliging letter, which I have
ſo much pleaſure in reading; although I was very much ſurpriſed, that
you ſay to me, that they have written to you from London, that Mr.
Bothmar has declared for the Whigs. But, as you ſay, towards the end
of your letter, that the rumour may be falſe, I ſhall have no difficulty
to convince you, that it is; and you will ſee, by the memorial, which he
has given on the part of the Elector, that neither Whigs nor Tories are
mentioned in that affair. But as the Queen did the honour to my ſon,
the Elector, to demand, by my lord Rivers, his opinion of the prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
of peace, he thought it was his duty to give it, which he would
not have done, if her Majeſty had not commanded him; and it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

by his order nor by the order of Bothmar, that the memorial has

You ſay, likewiſe, that you are of no party; yet if that party, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed

had gained ſo many battles and towns, I would be equally for him: and

certainly the ſame diſcourſe is now held, and has been ſince time held

ſo confounded, that even a native of our country can hardly diſtinguiſh
them; and how much leſs could Mr. Bothmar, who has not been, in all

                  <p>—"I Have this comfort, that, in ſpite of all inſinuations to the
contrary, I have begun, by making the French, at the very
firſt conference, declare themſelves ready to acknowledge your ſucceſſion
to the crown of England, and that they will ſend the Pretender to travel
where we pleaſe. This we did artificially enough, at the firſt conference,
in ſpite of all the intrigues were uſed to hinder us from ſpeaking till the
French had been obliged to give their ſpecifique explications; and this we
did, without that any Whig can pretend the leaſt merit in it; though I
believe, they who always ſtrive to attribute all to themſelves, will ſtrive
to attribute what has been done at home to their induſtry. However it
is, at leaſt, they muſt own it was not oppoſed by the Tories.—I am
glad, in one part of my arguments, your Royal Highneſs ſeemed to
aqueſſe, that you never loved or liked the dutcheſs of Marlborough's
character; and that you thought the duke's way of ſpeaking of the Queen
was in too ſlighting a manner. If your Royal Highneſs had known and
ſeen as much as the Queen has done, you would think much worſe of
both; really, Madam, a prince is happier that rules the hearts of all his
people, than he who is ſet up by one, and ſets himſelf at the head but of
one party. In a limited monarchy, he reigns but over half his people.
The temper and conſtitution of England is mightily miſtaken by ſome
people; this the Queen ſaw, that by reigning by one party, was but
being a ſlave to the heads of that party; and, therefore, when ſhe firſt
made her change, it was poſſitively reſolved not to ſtick to parties, but
to thoſe who ſerved her beſt. However, the other party's oppoſition and
violence may have made her change her mind for the mere neceſſity at
this conjuncture: if your Royal Highneſs was but to hear half the ſtories
I heard, when I was laſt in Britain, you would wonder how the Queen's
patience could bear ſo long what ſhe has borne; ſuch uſage no miſtreſs
of a family would have borne from their menial ſervants. But I hope
there is an end of it, and that ſhe will ſpend the reſt of her days happily,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0950500102:368"/>
as ſhe really deſerves to do for her many good qualities. We are now all
hard at work, and we ſhall put that article of your Royal Highneſs's ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
and obliging France to promiſe, that they ſhall not, neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
nor indirectly, aſſiſt the Pretender; that I hope you will have
reaſon to be ſatisfied with us. I wiſh I knew any thing you deſired
more, in theſe negociations; ſince really, beſides the honour, nothing
could be more agreeable to me, than to receive your commands and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute

acknowledging the juſt title of the Queen and the proteſtant ſucceſſion.
The King of France told me himſelf, the day that his Majeſty ſwore to

to time, hoping to have had ſomething worth ſending you, and that, at
laſt, the French would have explained themſelves; but as they keeped us
in expectations, and put us off from week to week; I likewiſe differed my
writing, and was, at laſt, ſent for ſuddenly over hither, where, though
I have been eight days, I have been in ſuch a hurry, that I have hardly
had time to ſeek or pick up any thing worth writing; however, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
your Royal Highneſs is pleaſed to allow me, is too precious for me
to neglect, even though I have little more than the repetition of the
zeal and true attachment I have for your Royal Highneſs and
your intereſt. I found the miniſtry very buſy about a bill of Reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which they had a great mind ſhould paſs the houſe of lords, and
was very nigh it, as no doubt your Royal Highneſs has heard, being the
laſt and concluſive votes, were equal; I was out of the houſe, wanting
the formality of being introduced as Earl, which I was to-day, after the
Queen was gone from the houſe, where ſhe has been to paſs a money-bill;
ſo that I was neither obliged to vote againſt the court and miniſtry, nor
againſt my late Maſter's grants, nor againſt a good one he has given me.
I thought it a very difficult point, and am glad it is ended as it is. The
whole town was in expectations the Queen would have ſaid ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
about the peace; but not doing it, the commons were very angry,
and ſome warm ſpeeches were made, which ſhewed the great uneaſineſs
there is in that houſe, to have a peace; ſo much that ſome expreſſed
themſelves, that if the Queen met with any difficulty from her Allies,
if ſhe would lay it before the parliament, they would eaſe her; but they
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0950500102:370"/>
were told by a miniſter of ſtate, they muſt be eaſy, at leaſt, till Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday
ſe'night, and by that time, the Queen would lay ſomething before
them, which was hoped would be to their ſatisfaction. This uneaſineſs
ſhows that any peace almoſt would be agreeable to the nation, and yet
I am perſuaded we ſhall have a good one, and ſuch a one that was not
expected, and muſt be reliſhed by every one who really wiſhes well to
Europe; <hi>for ſince it is thought ſo dangerous to leave Philip</hi> on the throne of

has drawn others into his errors. I can't help telling your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

                  <p>"I Arrived from Garlow, with Mr. de Bernſtorff, but an hour before
the departure of the poſt, ſo that I muſt anſwer, in great hurry, the
letter with which your Excellency honoured me. It were to be wiſhed
you had made theſe difficulties while you were here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0950500102:376"/>
I never told you that I would inſert the names of the regents in the
blanks left in the copy of the inſtrument; there is not even room for
them. I gave you the names of thoſe who were formerly, and who are
now intended to be regents (to which have been added ſince, lord Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,
lord Polwarth, and lord Annandale). There are ſeveral remarks
on the laſt, and a cypher concerning the Queen's health.—Your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
muſt avoid to diſcover to any one that theſe names are known to
you.</p>
                  <p>I come now to your remarks.</p>
                  <p>1. While lord Bolingbroke is ſecretary of ſtate, to whom ſhall your
Excellency addreſs yourſelf? and how can you avoid to pay ſome atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to him?</p>
                  <p>There will be no occaſion for this, if he is deprived of that poſt.</p>
                  <p>2. The officers which the Electreſs is to have in England, are but
very few in number. She herſelf inſiſts to offer the nomination of them
to Harley.</p>
                  <p>I added that to your inſtructions, contrary to my own opinion. But
you are to underſtand it ſo, only in caſe your Excellency ſees no proſpect
of ſucceeding in the affair without that offer; for if you can obtain the
penſion ſimply, without any limitations or conditions, it will be certainly
ſo much the better, and the Electreſs will be the more obliged to you.</p>
                  <p>3. The Elector would very much diſguſt thoſe who want now, by
way of precaution againſt a caſe which is ſcarcely poſſible, to put him
to the trouble of naming regents by ſeparate inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>The act of parliament gives that power only to the neareſt heir; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Elector has it not, and the validity of his nomination at this
time might be diſputed. It is to be hoped that the Queen and the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
will not die in the ſame week.</p>
                  <p>4. As their Electoral Highneſſes always aſſured the Queen and her
miniſters that none of the family would go to England without her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
conſent; that will be ſtill the caſe, if a penſion is granted to the
Electreſs, and being under that new obligation to the Queen, they will
be the more diſpoſed thereby, to do nothing but in concert with her.
Beſides, the more the ſucceſſion is firmly eſtabliſhed, the leſs will the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0950500102:377"/>
preſence of the ſucceſſor be neceſſary. Add to this the paſt conduct of
their Electoral Highneſſes; for each party, in their turn, incited them
to apply for an invitation to go to England, and they always rejected all
theſe intrigues, being determined to do nothing in that reſpect, unleſs the
Queen entreated them to it.</p>
                  <p>5. It is not probable that the Engliſh miniſtry will ſtipulate, on pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our arrears, that the troops will not return again to the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
If they ſhall think of any thing ſo fooliſh, your Excellency will be
ſo good as to write about it to our maſter, and to wait for his orders.</p>
                  <p>6. Monſieur de Bothmar having given ſome poor lords reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſmall penſions, our maſter would never hear of it; therefore, your
Excellency is in the right not to give a preſent of a crown without orders;
you may demand them when the opportunity offers. If the houſe will
enable you to make donations when you judge proper, or obtain the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of his Electoral Highneſs, let them do ſo. For my ſhare, I am
a mere cypher when it is neceſſary to aſk a penny; and I cannot at all
meddle in the affair. I am, &amp;c."</p>

ſucceſſion had embarraſſed the intrigues of the Jacobites, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the year 1712, the moſt fatal ſtroke to their cauſe was the death of the
duke of Hamilton. That nobleman was killed unfairly in a duel, in Hyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>park,
on the 15th of November, while he was upon the point of ſetting
out for France, in the character of ambaſſador-extraordinary. The ſecret
object of his embaſſy, the Jacobites affirmed, was to obtain the Iriſh regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the French ſervice, to be conveyed with the Pretender, in a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
manner, to Scotland. The Queen herſelf, eager for the eventual
ſucceſſion of her brother, is ſaid to have approved of this ſcheme. Her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
was to enter into a treaty with the Pretender upon his arrival; by which
ſhe was to permit him to remain, during her own life in Scotland, under
the character of preſumptive heir of the crown. His friends in parliament
were ſo numerous, that ſhe formed no doubt of being able to repeal the
act of ſettlement. Theſe meaſures were prevented by the duke's death.
But the Jacobites continued their intrigues, in Great Britain, with unabat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diligence, and entertained great hopes of ſucceſs. The nation owed
the diſappointment of their ſchemes to the timidity of their leaders, and
the enthuſiaſm of the Pretender himſelf, in adhering to the Romiſh faith,
contrary to the advice of all his friends. The following papers throw a
new and very important light on the hiſtory of the preſent year. The

which the Queen ſent laſt night to the King. I ſend here the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view

from their reflecting that King Charles had been Catholic long

before the reſtoration; yet that he temporiſed and never declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Catholic, till upon his death-bed; and that this encouraged them
to hope, that the King, ſeeing the impoſſibility of his being reſtored
without temporiſing, in the ſame manner, might be perſuaded to it. I
let him ſee the caſe was no way the ſame; for whatever inclinations King
Charles might have had to the Catholic Religion, he never was received
into the church, till his laſt illneſs; whereas the King has been educated
from his infancy in the Catholic Religion, and has all his life made open
profeſſion of it. He could not but own the difference of the caſe; but
ſeemed not to believe that King Charles had not been received Catholic
before his reſtoration, though certainly he was not. However, he repeated
again, that the King ſhould be no more teazed upon that ſubject.</p>

Mr. Gould's ſucceſſor [Harley], and ſeems confident that the latter is

Bruce doubts of Gould's good intentions. Whatever may be in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

for his knight's [Sir Thomas Hanmer] having received the letter,

that, at bottom, he muſt be our friend; though he was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that it was hard to diſcover his machinations, and when he ſpoke,
thought himſelf obliged to ſpeak in conformity to the preſent ſtanding
acts of parliament. He told me, at the ſame time, that the knight was
ſo far diſguſted with Honyton's [Oxford's] proceedings, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
not to return to England, till he ſaw what turn affairs were like to
take; that he had already taken meaſures for going to the ſouth of
France, and from thence into Italy, and waited only the arrival of my
lord Shrewſbury, from whom he expects more particular information;
and that, if that lord did not ſatisfy him as to ſome things, that he would
immediately ſet out for Montpelier. This he told me, as a very great

here, this very night. I find they are nettled at Hamden's, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Whig, being taken into favour, and now to be ſent to Hannover;
and that Honyton [Oxford] has lately put in ſome of the moſt violent
Whigs to be high ſheriffs in ſome counties, on purpoſe to influence the next

                  <p>"I Have received yours of the 25th of November, with great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and have anſwered it before, and writ to you to the ſame effect
of this; but ſince you direct me to ſend again, by the old direction, the
laſt not being found good, for fear that may not come to your hands, I
get my friend, who incloſes this to his correſpondent, to take care of it.
Mr. Rogers<note n="‡" place="bottom">Plunket.</note> told me he would write, and deſired a new patron<note n="§" place="bottom">Cypher.</note>; and
that then he would ſend what would be very acceptable, on all accounts.
It is certainly in his power to do it effectually, as you will find. What I
earneſtly deſired in my laſt, was, that you would uſe all your intereſt to
fix the remittance of Mrs. Rachel Jones's [the Queen's] money, which
will be returned from hence, by our friend [Mr. Arthur] that incloſes
this. There is none ſo proper: his known honour, and integrity, and
ſubſtance, is ſo unqueſtionable, that I think there cannot be the leaſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
but, as the thing is conſiderable, one does not know what intereſt
may be made. I did beg and do again, that you will be pleaſed to move
it heartily. Mrs. Phillips [lady Middleton] can get it determined for
him, with a word's ſpeaking; and as I told you before, Mrs. Harris
[Harley] did deſire it may be ſo. He ſpoke to Mr. Rogers's friend to
get it done; for he eſteems him it is deſired for. He ſent for him to him,
and deſired him to remit a conſiderable ſum "for him, that was of the beſt
quality, that has been laſtly with you" [Secretary St. John], on Mrs. Dian.
Mansfield's [princeſs Anne's] account; ſo that I beg you to get an anſwer
from Mrs. Rachel Jones [the Queen], if it be not already done. As I beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
before, you may, if you pleaſe; ſend yours to his correſpondent, to
ſend the ſhort way, and it will come ſafe. I cannot change my opinion of
him I have named [Mr. Harley]. On Mr. Jenkins' [the King's] account, he
would engage all; but keeps the balance in his own power, to give a turn
the way he thinks will prove moſt ſuitable to continue for his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
intereſt. He makes himſelf many enemies, and ſecures but few
friends; for thoſe that are in Mr. Jenkins' [the King's] intereſt, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inate
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0950500102:388"/>
the trimming way he takes; and he will not be able to go on
much longer, without giving ſome other demonſtration than he yet has.
Mr. Tom Smith [lord Mulgrave] is ſincere, and he will not be led in ſo
dark a path. When Mr. Medlicote [the parliament] comes, there will
be another ſtorm raiſed againſt him. Would Mr. Sandy [Hannover]
come into his meaſures, he would, we all do believe, join entirely with
him; and that is the reaſon, thoſe that are entirely for Mr. Jenkins [the
King] do ſo rail and hate him. He depends only upon the widow's
[princeſs Anne's] opinion of him, which will fail him, if Mr. Thomas
Smith [lord Mulgrave] and his friends can prevail upon her. Mrs. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips's
nephew [lord Shrewſbury] will not do any thing in favour of Mrs.
Rachel Jones's [the King's] relations. He is a very cautious man, and
hates his principles, though he may wiſh otherways well, in ſome ſenſe.
He is ſent to be out of Mr. Harris's [Harley's] way. He could wiſh,
without doubt, to get Mr. Tom [lord Mulgrave] away, on any plauſible
account; but he acts ſuch a game, that cannot hold long, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide can depend on him. The next term will ſhow a great deal
what we have to truſt to. We have very good council, that will do the
utmoſt at that hearing. You ſhall have a particular account how all
paſſes. Mrs. White would beg, that if it were poſſible, you would get
your friend, Sam Brown [Sir William Ellis], to ſend her, by ſome of
thoſe that have now a privilege to carry what they pleaſe, twenty ells of
taffeta, ſuch as they wear for mantuas, in ſummer, of a bright blue. It
will take but little room, and it would oblige a friend of hers, if it could
be done. It generally coſts a crown or ſomething more an ell. Pardon this
trouble, and believe me moſt ſincerely, Sir, your moſt humble ſervant."</p>

                  <p>"I Came here and acquitted myſelf of your lordſhip's commands near
the duke, in returning him the King's thanks for his kind offices.
He anſwered me, that his deſign to oblige the King, would induce him
to do a great deal more, if it lay in his power, and appeared glad that
the expreſſion of his Majeſty's paſſport was to his Majeſty's liking, as he
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0950500102:392"/>
deſigned it. As to the Emperor's ſafe conduct, it is ſtill the ſame with
the copy I had the honour to ſend your lordſhip ſome time ago; but the
duke had an explicatory letter, that diſpenſes him from the hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
impoſed upon him by the former, though, in effect, it meant
nothing, that could lay any eſſential obligation upon the duke, to be
reſponſible for the King's conduct, &amp;c. it being what they call Stile de
chancellerie, and intended rather as an admonition, than a binding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
to which his Royal Highneſs holds himſelf liable.—In his ſecond
letter from the Emperor, he has what ſecures and ſatisfies his nicety
upon that point; ſo that he deſigns to ſend to your lordſhip, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
and his own paſſport, as ſoon as he has his anſwer from the court
of France, which is not yet come. His Royal Highneſs expects alſo,
by the latter end of this month, an anſwer from Holland, about the ſafe
conduct of that ſtate, and does not ſee any difficulty to be made of it."</p>
                  <p>January 28, 1713. "This day, his Royal Highneſs gave me the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
copy of the Emperor's laſt letter, in order to ſend it to your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
The reaſon why he has not ſent it ſooner was, that he feared your
lordſhip might, by the tenour of this letter, apprehend ſtill that it implied
a kind of injunction to his Royal Highneſs, to obſerve the King's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
&amp;c. But, as it is, in effect, but an exhortation from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
and that the duke is very far from acting any part that might be
diſobliging to the King, or that did not become his own character; he
hopes thoſe words, of courſe, ſuch as he looks upon them to be in the
Emperor's letter, will not ſtartle your C. the main point, I think
is, that his Royal Highneſs is well enough ſatisfied, that, by that letter,
he lies under no obligation to anſwer for any of the King's actions.</p>
                  <p>He has an account from Holland, that his envoy having told the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Briſtol the Emperor's ſafe conduct was come, the latter was
curious to know, by what name or qualification the Emperor ſpecified
our King; and having read the copy of that inſtrument, appeared well
enough pleaſed, that he was not at all named in it; but deſigned by the
words <hi>exhibitor preſentium.</hi> The prelate told our envoy, that they (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Engliſh) were obliged to the duke of Lorraine, for the care he
took to facilitate the execution of one of the articles agreed upon betwixt
them and France. The ſame letter gives an account, that the envoy had
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0950500102:393"/>
writ to the penſionary, to know who he ought to addreſs himſelf to, for
to ſolicit the State's ſafe conduct. The duke believes, that that of the
Emperor's will ſerve for a model and a motive to diſpatch theirs. He
expects, in a few days, a courier, that may inform him further about it,
which I ſhall wait for.</p>
                  <p>The duke preſumes, that the ſafe conduct from England has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
a great while ago; his envoy there having writ poſitively to
him, above three months ago, that he had been told ſo by the miniſter.
Your lordſhip knows what there is of it, and may perhaps judge it proper
to inform me of it; for if it be not granted yet, and that it may require
the ceremony of being ſolicited by his Royal Highneſs, he is ready to
act in that, according to inſtructions, and to do all things elſe that may
contribute to his Majeſty's ſatisfaction and ſettlement at Bar."</p>

and to make them odious to him, though they were the people

in very good eſteeme, and thoght very capable of buſſineſſe, but that
ſince he changed his religion, they had not ſoe good an opinion of him.—After

nor ſoe advantageous, as to be the means and inſtrument of bringinge

honeſt a man as he often tould me he was, it ought not to be difficult; to

twere not for the aforeſaid raiſons.</p>
                  <p>I then aſkt him whether the great man Harle, he believed ever

he was ſo cuning and cloſe a man, that wan ſhod not deſpayre of him,
thogh he dos things that ſeeme very opoſite to our maſter's intereſt;
and that his friend, the knight, knew no more of that particular then
what he told me.—I tould him that, ſince their Queene cod not live for
ever, that my thoghts Mr. Harle wod doe very prudently to ſtrike up
with the King, to have all confirmed upon him, and continued to him
by the King, after the death of their Queene. He anſwered, that if the

and made intelligible as follows. "<hi>A Copy of the two firſt pages of Mrs. White's letter of</hi> 26 Jan./6 Feb. 1713, <hi>which
are written in a cut paper.</hi>"</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Anecdotes of the Earl of Oxford.—He has promiſed his intereſt to the Elector
of Hannover, who does not truſt him.—The King of France, by Oxford's
means, muſt guarantee the ſucceſſion.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>"MR. Harley has aſſured the D. of Hannover, by all that is ſacred,
that he intends his faithful ſervice; and ſhowed that what he has
done was to ſtem a tide, and that had he acted otherwiſe, it would have
ruined all; and that, by being in with ſome Jacobites, he is come to the
knowledge of all their deſigns, and knows their weakneſs and ſtrength;
and by his ſon in-law, he is come to a better intelligence with Hanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0950500102:397"/>
and that ſon was, and is, a great favourite at Hannover. But the
Whigs ſo poſſeſſed Hannover of the trickiſh temper of Harley, that yet
he does not entirely rely on him; but demands, for a proof of what he
proteſts, that he will give him this proof, that he will get all the ſheriffs
of each county in, that are Low Church, and a motly miniſtry, and the
King of France to be guarantee for the ſucceſſion for him, and his ſon
and grand-ſon to do the ſame; this, and all other terms which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
Harley has promiſed to do all in his power to perform. And,
on his ſide, Harley demands that it ſhall not be inſiſted on to have lord
Wharton, nor any of thoſe that were in the miniſtry, who are his perſonal
enemies, but ſuch as are for moderate ways. He would prove, that
that ſet were againſt Hannover, and aimed at doing for themſelves; but
he is content to have the late chancellor Cowper, and ſome of that ſtamp
in, and this is to reconcile him to the body of the Whigs, and promiſes
all aſſurances to him and his. This is now upon the anvil, and you may
aſſure my lord Middleton of it, for I was told it by Mr. Cowper (brother
to the late lord chancellor Cowper) as the greateſt ſecret, and I am ſure
it is moſt true; his brother told it to him."</p>
                  <p>The laſt two pages of this letter are decyphered in the original.</p>
                  <p>"The perſon I have named is a very cunning falſe man, and has
ſeveral of Mr. Jenkins's [the King's] friends frequently with him, only to
draw all he can, to do him the more eſſential wrong. My council hates
him [Harley], and uſes to repeat all his unfair practices; yet, at this
time, owns that he has ſo warded againſt a ſtorm, that few beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
could have done; and added, that it was the opinion of all of his ſort,
that if he gave the proofs which he had promiſed, and orders it ſo, to
have the family of Medlecot [parliament] to be ſuch as they had been
ſome years paſt, he will be in eſteem with thoſe that now hate him.
Here is no public news. We that are called Whigs, are in great hopes
things will go better; for all that can be done yet, to procure a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Low Church Men, is done: the ſheriffs of each county, where
there are any of that ſort of men pricked, they are choſen, though the
counties are as averſe as ever, or more; and it is ſaid, there will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the council ſeveral of the ſame ſort. The French ambaſſador
has inraged the people in bringing over ſo vaſt a quantity of wine, and
ſuffering his ſervants to ſell it, from his own houſe, by retail, at ſix and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0950500102:398"/>
ſeven ſhillings a bottle. I know ſeverals that have bought it ſo, and
drank it in his cellar, and paid down their money there; and they ſell
ſilk. The Spittle-field weavers have a deſign to pull down his houſe,
becauſe they have bought and ſold great quantities of ſilk, they report,
to the value of 200,000 <hi>l.;</hi> this breeds ill blood, and was very impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticly
done. Mr. Jacob [King of France], I am told, conſents to be
ſurety for Mr. Sandy [Hannover], and his relation [King of Spain] the
ſame. This is owing to Mr. Harris [Harley], and he, with Mr. Jacobs,
now that is lately gone to him [lord Shrewſbury]. Your friend Mr.
Bartholeme [Mr. Mathews<note n="*" place="bottom">D. of Buckingham.</note>], is zealous for his chief [the King]: but
what can they do? If they conſent to contradict Mr. Harris's [Harley's]
meaſures, they will have their congée given them, and turned away,
and now there is a way in the family to give their opinion, that the
choice before them is writ to make it ſtand ſo, though it be quite wrong;
that advantage they can have by thoſe that ſend up to them, it has been
the practice theſe late years in that family; and all that can be done will
be practiſed, notwithſtanding the general bent is otherwiſe. I have tired
you, who am, with all eſteem, &amp;c."</p>

he is very ſenſible of Cowly's [church of England] friendſhip, and truly

                  <head type="sub">This extract is in Sir William Ellis's hand, and was probably ſent by
him to the earl of Middleton. Almoſt every circumſtance is authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by the Hannover Papers of the ſame month.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>About the ſucceſſion to the crown after the death of Queen Anne, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
for ſecuring it for her brother.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>"THAT what he had ſaid, in a former letter, viz. That Mr. Harley
and his brethren would call home the King; he had it from, and
has ſince had it confirmed to him by, Mr. Netterville; which is, he ſays,
as much as if he had had it from Mr. Harley's own mouth: and that he
has had the ſame thing confirmed to him, at ſeveral times, by Mr. Pen,
the Quaker.</p>
                  <p>That lord Mulgrave, and the reſt of his opinion, would be glad to
have the King home as ſoon as poſſible, if they knew how to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
running any hazard; and that princeſs Anne is of the ſame mind,
but timorous. This, he ſays, comes from lady Fretchwel.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons he gives for not making uſe of a cypher formerly ſent to
Mr. Netterville, in order to his correſponding with my lord Middleton,
are, that the French miniſters had given him a diſadvantageous character
of my lord Middleton. That his lordſhip and lord Melfort do not agree,
and betray one another. That Mr. Netterville was deſired from thence,
(that is, from St. Germains, or from Paris) not to correſpond with any
there, for he would have been betrayed. But that Mr. Netterville tells
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0950500102:405"/>
him, that my lord Middleton and Sir William Ellis are honeſt, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and underſtand the affairs of England the beſt of any he knows,
conſequently the fitteſt to be entruſted and employed. He gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon, for not uſing the cypher ſent to Netterville, viz. Leſt Mr.
Harley ſhould know he correſponds with any about the King, and gives
meaſures different from Mr. Harley's, and ſuch as may hinder the King
from coming to the terms, which he ſays, perhaps, may be expected from
his Majeſty; that Mr. Harley would have the King kept in the dark,
believe nothing but what comes from him, or think of a reſtoration but
by his means; and that the King muſt abandon Rome, if he deſires to
come home. Mr. Netterville aſked him, why he did not ſend ſome body
to the King, to know his mind; he replied, the King of France would
know it and would raiſe diſturbances in England, which he (Harley)
would prevent all he can; which, Mr. Rogers ſays, he believes, he will
do, as long as princeſs Anne lives; and adviſes not to believe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
or rely on a civil war, as Meſſrs. Harley and Netterville ſay, they
are ſure, we are made believe, by Sheridan, Mrs. Fox, Mr. Minnis, Mr.
Ferguſon, and theſe, Mr. Rogers ſays, he calls Propaganda ſtories.
Theſe, he deſires, may not be believed, becauſe the writers are ſtrangers
to the affairs on the anvil.</p>
                  <p>He ſays, he is ſurprized that Sir William Ellis had not the papers he
ſent him from Rotterdam; and ſays, he directed one of them to Sir
Richard Cantillon.</p>
                  <p>That D. Hamilton propoſed to obtain of the King of France four
or five regiments to have gone with the King to Scotland; and then prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
Anne and the parliament would have ventured to treat with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
which they won't hazard to do otherwiſe till after the peace, and
till they have turned out all the Low Church men; which being done,
will ſend to treat with his Majeſty,, and with the King of France, who
muſt give as a ſecurity for the King's performance.</p>
                  <p>That Mr. Harley manages the Low Church and Hannover, till he
can get the peace ſettled. Believes him hearty to the King's intereſt, and
has ſeveral inſtances of it, though few of the Jacobites believe him to
be ſo.</p>
                  <p>The cabinet-council are for the King, for their own intereſt and fear;
but will hazard nothing. That Mr. Harley has ſo watchful an eye over
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0950500102:406"/>
him (Rogers), that he can't go to lord Mulgrave nor B—; but
lord Yarmouth goes between them. That Mr. Netterville knows every
thing, and Mr. Harley conſults him in every thing; and yet he (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as it is ſuppoſed, Netterville) would have the King reſtored at any
rate.</p>
                  <p>That they (Mr. Rogers and Mr. Netterville) would fain make duke
D'Aumont ſubſervient to the King's intereſt; but Rogers thinks he and
thoſe about him, are more capable of ſpoiling than doing buſineſs, for he
(duke D'Aumont) thinks he knows more than he does, won't be adviſed,
and pretends to know England, of which he knows nothing at all; but
however, thinks he may be made ſome uſe of, ſuch as to fetch and carry.
He deſires this may be read to none, but to the King.</p>
                  <p>That the cabinet-council intend to purge the army and the guards,
and make a thorough regulation in the kingdom. That he (Rogers)
will give a full account of all circumſtances, when he comes. That he
is told, he ſhall, after a little time, be ſent to Bar, to let the King know
his true friends in Scotland and England; but whether he is ſent or no,
he will endeavour to come, becauſe it will be of uſe to his Majeſty's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
though he knows Monſ. Torcy and Mr. Harley do not deſire he
ſhould go at preſent; but he ſays, he will find a good colour, when there
is occaſion.</p>
                  <p>That a great many of the Whigs have ſubſcribed a paper, and ſent it
to princeſs Sophia, ſetting forth their own ſtrength, and adviſing that
young Hannover may be ſent to England, whither he may lawfully come
(being naturalized a peer). That he (Rogers) could have got ſaid paper
ſecured; but thought it beſt to let it be ſent, in order to let Hannover
further expoſe himſelf, to no purpoſe, which will turn to the King's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
By way of poſtſcript to this letter, which is of the 14/25 February,
he ſays, he had juſt then had a letter from Holland, adviſing, that lord
Churchill and his friends are taking meaſures to ſend over young Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover;
as being the only reſort he and his party have. But Mr. Rogers
thinks, as before, the ſooner he attempts it the better. In his letters of the
20 February,/3, March, he gives an account of the meaſures lord Churchill and the
Dutch are taking, and particulars of the paper which the Whigs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
and ſent to the princeſs Sophia; viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="390" facs="tcp:0950500102:407"/>
That princeſs Anne could not live longer than March.</p>
                  <p>That ſhe (princeſs Sophia) ſhould order matters ſo, as to be ready to
come at twenty-four hours warning.</p>
                  <p>That they will get the heads of the clergy to give princeſs Anne a
memorial; ſetting forth, that the King is coming to England, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him the Roman Catholic religion. This they believe will make
the country declare for the ſucceſſion of Hannover, and give a handle
to the parliament to ſend for princeſs Sophia and her grandſon, as the
only pledges ſhe (princeſs Anne) and the kingdom can have, at preſent,
for the ſecurity of the proteſtant religion, in and out of England, for the
future.</p>
                  <p>That they will urge, in their ſaid memorial to have the Whigs ſhare
equally with the Tories in the government.</p>
                  <p>That they will get the D. of Hannover's miniſter in England to ſecond
this memorial, which Mr. Rogers ſays, he hopes he (Hannover's mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter)
will do; but believes the cabinet-council will prevent the giving of
any ſuch memorial. That Mr. Harley laughed at it, but looks on it to
be well concerted.</p>
                  <p>That Somers, Halifax, and C—r, are preſſing Netterville daily, to
uſe his intereſt with Mr. Harley, to bring them and their friends into
buſineſs; that the perſon who manages this affair with Netterville is his
(Mr. Rogers's) acquaintance; and tells him alſo, that Cowper, the late
chancellor, if he could get off handſomely from the Whigs, would join
with princeſs Anne in all her meaſures.</p>
                  <p>That he (Rogers) knows, Mr. Harley is for dividing the employments
betwixt the High and Low Church, and for having the chooſing of them
himſelf; hoping, by that means, to be maſter, whoever gets the crown.
But that the October-club will never ſuffer this, and Mr. Harley ſtands
in awe of that club, which is jealous of him already; and if he ſhould
ſhare the places, as aforeſaid, he would ſoon be diſcarded.</p>
                  <p>That Mr. Harley has ſpies among the Whigs, that diſcover all their
deſigns; and he lets them play with their plot, till he ſees his time to
break it, and then they begin another. This, Mr. Rogers ſays, he knows
to be true, as having been employed in theſe matters from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:0950500102:408"/>
That, if the papers he (Rogers) has given to the cabinet-council were
publiſhed, he doubts not, they would reconcile all the kingdom to the
King's intereſt; but that Mr. Harley, believing this would leſſen his
credit with the King, and give his Majeſty occaſion to think, what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he (Harley) might do was more out of neceſſity than duty and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
has oppoſed and prevailed with princeſs Anne to oppoſe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of ſaid papers, which lord Mulgrave and his Majeſty's true
friends were for having done. That there are two parliament-men who
would fain have him (Rogers) give them ſome of thoſe papers: that they
would improve them to advantage. But he ſays, he thinks it too nice
a thing to venture upon, without advice: ſo deſires Sir William Ellis's
opinion, by the next ordinary, and believes the October-club would
make a good buſineſs of it.</p>
                  <p>That there is an old acquaintance of his (Rogers) there (at London),
who ſends intelligence to princeſs Sophia of what the Whigs are doing.
That the ſaid perſon ſhows him (Rogers) all ſhe ſends. That ſhe is a
great confident of princeſs Sophia's; and, by this means, he (Rogers)
ſhall have a further occaſion, he ſays, of ſerving the King.</p>
                  <p>That we, he ſays (meaning, as ſeems, himſelf and the King's friends
there) muſt ſtrain a point to get the King ſoon reſtored; for lord Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
is old, and lord Shrewſbury is right, but timorous. Theſe two,
he ſuppoſes, govern the cabinet-council, and keep Mr. Harley in awe;
and that, if Mulgrave dies, Mr. Harley will ſend lord Shrewſbury to
Ireland, and then govern the cabinet-council to give the crown to whom
he pleaſes, and that this makes him (Harley) delay, and go ſo ſlow in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the government.</p>
                  <p>That, to prevent Mr. Harley's management as aforefaid, he (Rogers)
had thought fit to acquaint lord Mulgrave with ſome late advices he had
had from Holland, viz. That Heinſius is of opinion, Holland can't be
ſafe whilſt the government of England is in the hands of the Tories;
and that it ſhould be the buſineſs of the Dutch and Whigs, whether
there be war or peace, to blow up the Tories, or at least make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy.
That, ſince this advice has been communicated as aforeſaid, he
(Rogers) finds Mr. Harley is uneaſy and is afraid that the cabinet-council
will join with the Whigs, this ſeſſion of parliament, to ſend him to the
Tower; and to obviate it, he is for making five or ſix peers more, and
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0950500102:409"/>
to publiſh the peace, at leaſt with France and Spain, which he thinks
will ſo far pleaſe the two houſes, in regard of the advantages England
has by it, that they will be ſoon reconciled to him.</p>
                  <p>That, on 23 Feb./3 March, a man of note had advice from Ireland, that the
Whigs there are ready to declare for Hannover, and that the Weſt of
Scotland will join with them. That Netterville acquainted Mr. Harley
with this, and adviſed him to proceed forthwith to a thorough reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the three kingdoms; that, otherwiſe, princeſs Anne could not
be ſafe. That Mr. Harley anſwered, No danger. That the parliament
will be ſo well pleaſed with his conduct and management, that the Whigs
and their adherents will be ſoon laid on their backs. That all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
gentlemen are for princeſs Anne and her miniſters, and will not be
for Hannover. That the Whigs may make a noiſe this ſeſſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
Hannover to come to noſe princeſs Anne; yet all will not do, and
they will get no point by it; for the parliament will declare neither way.
Their buſineſs will be to ſecure the proteſtant religion, and order matters
ſo now, that it will not be in the King's power ever to hurt it. Mr.
Rogers adds, that, by this means, he (Harley) will weather the point.
And that you, he ſays, "may depend upon it, if there is truth in man,
and I, he ſays, underſtand any thing, the way is a paving for the King;
but as they are reſolved to run no riſque for a reſtoration, they'll take
their own time, and the ſafeſt way to do it; and the King of France is
in the ſecret;" and you will find all this to be true in the end.</p>
                  <p>I, he ſays, don't think the King ſafe at Barleduc, and that the allies
will ſtand at nothing to ruin him.</p>
                  <p>That he (Rogers) had, ſince his laſt, which was of the 23 February,/6 March,
introduced Netterville to D. D'Aumont, who diſcourſed with them two
hours and a half. That they ſhowed him how eaſy it would be, for his
maſter and him, to procure the King's reſtoration, if they would follow
the meaſures that ſhould be given them. That the ſaid duke anſwered,
"their deſire ſhould be ſtrictly complied with;" and that the King or
none of his houſe ſhould know any thing, till the buſineſs is done. He
(the duke) told them, he would rely on what intelligence they will give
him, and will give what money is neceſſary for carrying on his maſter's
buſineſs, which they had ſhowed him was to reſtore the King; with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0950500102:410"/>
to his own ſafety and welfare, of which he ſeemed to be ſenſible,
deſired their friendſhip and aſſiſtance, and ſaid they ſhould find their
account in it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis believed lord Nottingham will, at the meeting of the parliament,
inſiſt on Hannover's being ſent for.</p>
                  <p>That there is come for England one Widam of Camb, as he pretends
himſelf, from the King of France. That he told Mr. Netterville, that
the King is not much concerned for the crown; is nothing at all addicted
to the Roman Catholic religion; is in the hands of lord Middleton and
Sir William Ellis, both deiſts, and believes they'll make him one, and are
not at all liked or looked on in the court of France; and that lord Melfort
is the man he (Mr. Netterville) ſhould correſpond withal. This, and much
more ſuch fulſome ſtuff, it is ſaid Widam told Netterville, in order to
his acquainting Mr. Harley with it; but Mr. Netterville would not, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it would do the King harm; and, if ſaid man ſtays long, he will do
hurt. What is or has been doing for the King's intereſt hitherto may be
ſpoiled, by ſuch fooliſh management. The man means well; but Mr.
Netterville is not pleaſed with his actings, nor any that hears him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Netterville propoſed lately to Mr. Harley, to have a bill brought
in to break the triennial act, and to have the army put into truſty hands.
Mr. Harley anſwered, the breaking the triennial act would ſeem too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and there's reaſon to hope the next parliament will be as good as
this. The kingdom will be ſo well pleaſed with the peace, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
miniſters will be better ſettled than hitherto, and the late miniſters
more blaſted this ſeſſion than they were the laſt. That the country gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
will never be reconciled to the Whigs.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Rogers ſays, that moſt of the country gentlemen are for having
the King; but will hazard nothing.</p>
                  <p>That he finds, after a little while, the duke of Berwick may have a
paſſport to come for England; that he and lord Middleton and Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Ellis are not hated, but lord Melfort is. Mr. Netterville tells Mr.
Harley they are men of moderation, which is well looked on among
them in England.</p>
                  <p>That it's deſired, the King of France, or any of his, may not know,
that Mr. Rogers writes to Sir William Ellis, and what he writes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0950500102:411"/>
the King only may know it; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">month </seg>March.</label> and that Mr. Netterville tells him
they muſt ſerve the King unknown to the King of France and thoſe
about him; and that the King of France muſt make uſe of no other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
but what they in England give him."</p>

                  <p>"YOUR friend Mr. Pleſſington [the King] read your letter to me of
the 20th ult. with a great deal of ſatisfaction, finding you perſiſt
ſtill in your former opinion, that it is Baker's [Harley's] real intereſt, and
conſequently his inclination, to have Harper's [Hannover's] decree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed.
It's certain, that if Aylmer [the princeſs Anne] ſhould break
[die] before the cauſe be reheard, that Baker [Harley] is in as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of ſuffering in proportion as Manly [the King]; and, therefore, it is
reaſonable to hope he ſhould uſe all his endeavours to bring this matter
to a ſpeedy iſſue, as ſoon as poſſible he can, ſince delays are equally dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
for both.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh the late alarm he has had of Aylmer [the princeſs Anne] break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may quicken him a little for what was like to happen, when even
Berry himſelf, in ſome of his laſt letters, had no apprehenſion of Ayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's
[the princeſs Anne's] affairs being in any real danger, may happen
hereafter in effect, when leaſt feared or expected; and, in ſuch a caſe,
no wiſe merchant, who has his all at ſtake, ought to loſe a moment, to
enſure his effects and make himſelf and his partners eaſy.</p>
                  <p>I reckon Baker [Harley] is ſure of Philips [the peace] by this time;
and Young [princeſs Anne] and he may reckon upon Kemp's [King's]
friendſhip. Wanly [the Whigs] is low, at preſent, and they have it in
their power to make him [them] yet lower. Wheatly [the Engliſh] has
but one objection againſt Manly [the King], which Arnot and all Cary's
true relations [the church of England] know to be unreaſonable, ſince
all the reaſonable ſecurity Cary himſelf can deſire to remove all fears
of danger from Cotton's partnerſhip [the Roman Catholic religion],
Manly [the King] is willing to grant.</p>
                  <p>This old dying man Price [the parliament] is tractable. Baker [Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley]
has an aſcendant over him, and he cannot be ſure of having the
ſame credit with his ſucceſſor, nor that Young [princeſs Anne] himſelf
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0950500102:412"/>
will be then in being, and in a condition to ſupport him. Edward's
[England's] beſt relations ſpeak well of Manly [the King], at preſent;
and the generality of Wheatly's family [the Engliſh] are diſſatisfied with
Harper's [Hannover's] late behaviour; but theſe gentlemen being change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
their hearts may cool. All this conſidered, I confeſs, I cannot ſee
any prudent reaſon for Baker's [Harley's] dilatory proceedings: but he
being the chiefeſt lawyer, and his own intereſt ſo much concerned, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
[the King] muſt be governed by him, and comply with what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help; and, in the mean time, have patience and hope the beſt."</p>

is no key, in the whole correſpondence.</p>

will invite him to a better houſe before it be long."</p>

                  <p>"I Received, laſt poſt, the favour of two of yours together, of the 3d
and 10th March, which I had the honour to read, both to Mr.
Kennedy [the King] and Mr. Crofton [lord Middleton]. The firſt is
very ſenſible of your care of his and of Wiſely's [the Queen's] concerns;
and the latter gives you his kind ſervice, and is very glad you received
his letter. I am glad to find you ſtill ſo hearty in the hopes you have of
the recovery of the mortgage; but I find you have no hopes that old
Price [the parliament] will move any thing in the matter, ſo we muſt
truſt to his next heir. I pray God he may prove as honeſt a man as you
expect he will; and that no breaking<note n="†" place="bottom">Queen's death.</note> happens between this and the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the decree.</p>
                  <p>There is no doubt that common intereſt is the beſt ſecurity between
merchants, and therefore your argument is good; but intereſt, as well
as inclinations, change with time and other accidents. Beſides that, many
of the wiſeſt men miſtake their true intereſt every day; but, however,
we muſt be contented, in theſe uncertain times, with what certainty we
can have; and ſo Young [princeſs Anne] keep up his credit, I hope as
you do, that, ſoon or late, all will go well.</p>
                  <p>But I am ſorry you find Cary [church of England] ſo animated againſt
poor Cotton [Roman Catholic religion], who deſires only to live in peace
and quiet at home, and to give ſecurity that he never will meddle with
or diſturb Cary in the leaſt. I hope, when Cary, who is a reaſonable, juſt
man, is truly convinced that this is both Manly's [the King's] and Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's
[Catholics'] character, and their ſincere intention, he will not be ſo
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0950500102:415"/>
irreconcileable as he appears to be now that they are at a diſtance. As
for Waters, I do not wonder at his ill-nature; for he is naturally hot-headed,
and very much piqued at this time: but I hope counſellor Baker
[Harley], with the help of Mr. Philips [the peace], will bring him to
temper. I do aſſure you, Mr. Peacock's relations [the Proteſtants] re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all marks of friendship and eſteem from Pleſſington [the King], that
he can ſhew them, in the limited ſtate he is in, and will continue to do
ſo, not only becauſe it is his inclination, as well as his intereſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is naturally juſt and impartial to all his deſerving friends, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtinction of families.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, he loves old Edwards [England] ſo well, that he'll do any
thing to pleaſe him, that an honeſt man can do; and I am glad to find
Arnot gives it as the general opinion, both of friends and enemies, upon
Change, that his parting with his old friends, and eſpecially at this time,
would leſſen his character, and loſe his reputation and credit with all
ſides. He is certainly too honeſt a man to diſſemble or deceive any body,
and too wiſe, on the other hand, not to comply with any thing that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
in itſelf, in order to pleaſe and oblige his old uncle Edwards."</p>

for they find out more and more the blind ſide of Knox [King of France]

                  <p>I ſpoke to ſome honeſt men among the partners [parliament], this
day, and find by them they have but a mean opinion of Knox's [King of
France's] integrity and ability. Nothing will make him eſpouſe Mr. Ken's
[the King's] cauſe, but his Own ſafety for the future, and that of his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children,
which cannot be, if Hall [Hannover] comes hither. They
told, that it would be of vaſt ſervice to Mr. Ken [the King] if he did
but declare himſelf a Polet [Proteſtant]; the ſooner the better, eſpecially
if he does it ſpontaneouſly, and perform his quarantine; and, in the
mean time, his friends will be diſpoſing things to receive him; for, at
preſent, the temper of the men-worthy [the mob] is not for him, and it
will be work of time to bring them to it; for they have been ſerved with
venom this long time, and muſt have time to vomit it by degrees.</p>
                  <p>King Noble [Netterville] ſays, if he were the patron [Pope], he would
oblige Mr. Ken [the King] to declare himſelf a Polet [Proteſtant], be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and, when he compleats the work, appear with ſafety in his true ſhape,
and not be beholding to any body. As for thoſe that Knox [the King of
France] has here, he looks on them to be worthleſs fellows. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with none but ſycophants and men that can give them no true idea
of the affairs here, and therefore will have nothing more to do with them;
for they are in the way of ruin, and will do nothing that is for their own

there were no ſuch man as Knox [King of France] in the world.</p>

Quarington ſo much as ſpoke to him, or ſaw him, when he parted;

any thing in the world, and which would be the laſt thing in the world
he would do. The judgment you ſay Mr. Netterville made of it, viz.

                  <p>"YEſterday, dear Sir, the Queen made a ſpeech to both houſes. The
houſe of commons unanimouſly, except my lord William Pawlet,
voted an addreſs of thanks. The houſe of lords carried it by 78 againſt
43. The duke of Beaufort was the firſt that moved to thank her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:
he was ſeconded by the duke of Kent. My lord Halifax ſtood up
and ſaid, it was fit to know for what; for they ought to have had the
peace laid affore them firſt, and how the ſucceſſion is ſecured by the peace;
for the Pretender is but a day's journey further off; is ſtill within call:
that the Queen, when ſhe was laſt in the houſe, ſaid, ſhe would make
peace ſword in hand. Upon which there was ſix millions given; and,
ſoon after, the ſword was taken out of a ſucceſsful general's hand, and
a peace made when they might conquer France. He was ſeconded by
my lords Townſend, Cowper, Sunderland, Montague, who all ſpoke
with a deal of warmth and peeviſhneſs; which is flying in the face of the
Queen and miniſtry, and queſtioning her ſincerity, and not believing what
ſhe ſaid.</p>
                  <p>My lord Peterborough ſtood up and anſwered, ſeconded by my lord
[treaſurer, probably,] and a great many more of the tory lords, that it
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0950500102:419"/>
was time the ſword was taken out of the general's hands, or elſe he would
have been general for life, and continued the war, and the nation been
obliged to give many millions: that Hannover had three acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for him and the guarantee abroad, and more laws might be made
to ſecure it more, if they think fit; and if they be not ſatisfied with the
management of the miniſtry, they might appoint a committee to examine
matters, and due ſatisfaction ſhould be given them. This my lord trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
ſaid.</p>
                  <p>The Whigs ſay, the ſpeech is artfully drawn, and made popular, for
ſome ſiniſter ends; notwithſtanding, they will be as troubleſome as they
can, and ſay they will make my lord treaſurer uneaſy; but he laughs at
them, and values not what they can do. The next parliament will be
as good, if not better, than this. The Queen relies entirely on the loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of her ſubjects; which is as much as to ſay, that Hannover muſt do
the ſame, if he comes here, and be and lead by the miniſtry and
parliament.</p>
                  <p>Both are wording the addreſſes. There will be warm debates about the
wording of them. There will be new changes every day. My lord
Chomley gave up his ſtaff as comptroller of the houſehold, yeſterday,

                  <p>"APLETON [lord Athol] has got the ſtaton middle [the privy ſeal],
and is gone to Intler's houſe [Scotland] to regulate the affairs of
that houſe. Overbury [duke of Ormond] goes to Johnſon's houſe [Ireland]
to put the gold [government] of that houſe into honeſt hands. The
Allen [army] there is to be reduced from 12 to 8, that of Evelly [Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land]
will be reduced to 10 m. The Waggs [Whigs] will be blaſted, and
then diſcarded. Their management will be cenſured in Hangel's houſe
[houſe of commons] to-morrow, and then expoſed to the world. They
will fall unpitied. Did the menworthy [mob] but know the roguery of the
late mates [miniſtry], they would tear them to pieces. Overton [Harley]
will endeavour to keep them in the dark, as much as he can, and as long
as he can; the reaſon you ſhall know by word of mouth.</p>
                  <p>Arbuthnot [Argyle] begins to be obſtreperous. Overton [Harley]
thought to make him his ſmuggler [ſpy] on the Waggs [Whigs], and bully
them on occaſion; but he will do nothing for him, till he gets Hawley's
[duke Hamilton's] place. Overton [Harley] won't truſt him with it.
Arbuthnot [Argyle] is reſolved to hector him into it. Overton [Harley]
makes ſatires on him, in order to expoſe him, and thinks to ſilence him;
time will ſhew how they will end. The Waggs [Whigs] will ſpirit him
to be uneaſy to Overton [Harley] and Quaint [princeſs Anne]. They
ſay, they will move to have Mrs. Strange [princeſs Sophia] here; but I
am told, by ſome ſenſible men among the partners [parliament] they will
get no point by it; for they had enow of ſtrangers. They talk kindly
of Mr. Jenkins [the King], at leaſt to me, and begin to hate Hall
[Hannover] more and more, becauſe the Waggs [Whigs] ſtand up for
him. He has his ſeven braſs candleſticks in Hungal's houſe [houſe of
commons] which opens lightly in his favour. One of them ſaid, the
other day, that it was fitting Quaint [princeſs Anne] ſhould have no map
[money] before the portion [peace] was laid before them; if the ſtature
large [great ſeal] be put to it, ſhe ſhould not be aſhamed of letting them
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0950500102:422"/>
ſee it; but got no point by the brazen impudence. The next thing they
will do, is to object againſt every point of the portion [peace] to make
the mates [miniſters] odious; and Egleton's [the Emperor's] ſtanding
out, as he does, will give them a further handle to cavil. I muſt tell you,
by the by, if Egleton [the Emperor] would but cloſe with Knox [King
of France] the Duncans [Dutch] will be forced to vomit up what they
are to get by this pardon [general peace], and of courſe, will be glad to
give a helping hand to Mr. Kennedy [the King]. He would do well to
make a propoſal of this kind to him, by his nephew there. I knew full
well, the Waggs [Whigs] make him and Hall [Hannover] believe
Quaint [princeſs Anne] won't live long, and of courſe, he muſt come here,
and then renew the weatherhot [war] again.</p>
                  <p>I have given convincing arguments to Egleton's mates [Emperor's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters]
that he muſt not believe the Waggs [Whigs] any more. I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
him every thing that happened him hitherto. He now finds it to be
true, to his coſt. I know Overton [Harley] and his brethren would be
glad on't; for it would give them a good handle to call Mr. Kennedy
[the King] home, and run no riſque or hazard of life or fortune. It is
true, the mates [miniſters] have enough under their thumb, to juſtify
their conduct in this point; but they are coverts [cowards]; ſo you ſee
we muſt drive that nail as far as it goes. You may depend on't they will
keep the ſame conduct with Mr. Kennedy [the King] as they did in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the portion [peace], and carry things on with the ſame caution,
which you'll ſay, will be tedious; but they think it more ſure. Overton
[Harley] is a goe cart, that muſt be pricked as he goes along.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore, Rogers put a precept [paper] into his hand, the other
day, that Moulſworth [lord Churchill] careſſes Hall [Hannover] mightily,
and is putting him on coming to Evelin's houſe [England] with a good
allen [army]. This and ſeveral other precepts [papers] he has given
him, with which he ſeemed well pleaſed, and no doubt will have good
effect, which is all that offers, at preſent, from, dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>

There is a tragedy called Cato, made by the Whigs. It was acted
ſeveral times. It makes impreſſion on the people. The Whigs ſay, it
will have as good an effect on the people, as Shacheverel's ſermons and
trial. They continue to bombard the Queen and miniſtry, every day;
but will get nothing by it. They have no intereſt in or out of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>"I Had the honour of yours of the 20th inſtant, and can tell you, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
deſigns to wait on you, as ſoon as practicable, which will
hardly be before the 1ſt of June, or Midſummer. There is a lady from
Hannover, that has ſome pretentions in the French court, where ſhe
will be recommended from hence, and from princeſs Sophia. He will
put himſelf into her retinue, and may be uſeful to her in France. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
Sophia will take it kindly of any body, that will do this lady any
ſervice. Rogers conceives he may be, by her means, being under ſo
great a princeſs's protection, more uſeful to Mr. Evans [Sir William
Ellis] and his maſter [the King], becauſe he can appear barefacedly.
He muſt, therefore, wait her time.</p>
                  <p>I muſt, dear Sir, be under your direction, whether I ſhould ſee Peyton.
[Polignac] or Tradenham [Monſieur de Torcy] before I ſee you. I
conceive I muſt ſtay ſome time at Putney [Paris] before I go to your
parts; and, if I ſhould ſee any body elſe, before I ſee Tradenham [Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
de Torcy] or Peyton [Polignac] it won't be taken well. If it could
be ordered ſo, that I could ſee Mr. Benſongs [duke of Berwick] as I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at Putney [Paris], it would be of uſe; he is, I know, a favourite at
Knox houſe [King of France]. I am reſolved to talk to none but him
and Mrs. Quarnington [the Queen]. I expect, by your next, to know
your mind and will, as to this point.</p>
                  <p>I was laſt night, with the gentleman [Mr. Sheridan, I ſuppoſe]. He
has the writings I ſpoke to you of before. He tells me they are ready
for the preſs. They will ſee whether Egleton [the Emperor] comes to,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0950500102:424"/>
by the time prefixed; if he does, what relates to him, will be ſtruck out;
for they don't think ſit to expoſe him. About the cloſe of the ſummer
[ſeſſion] they will publiſh them, in order to ſower the Chammiſmen
[country gentlemen] againſt the Waggs [Whigs], and to keep up their
ſpirits, till the new partners [parliament] are choſen. I find he gutted
the precepts [papers]; for, ſhould they print them, <hi>in haec verba,</hi> the men
worthy [mob] would tear the Waggs [Whigs] in pieces. Overton
[Harley] ſays, there is a medium between Scylla and Carybdis, and will
keep it as much as he can. The partners [parliament] will carry on their
buſineſs ſmoothly and roundly, with little or no noiſe, but with caution,
and manage that of the ſape [ſucceſſion] as they did the portion [peace],
and take their own time to do it, and it will be left entirely to them.
This I know to be Overton's [Harley's] mind, and his ſcheme, which will
be put in execution, when things are ripe for it, which cannot be before
the next new partners [parliament] meets. This you will find to be true.
I find Mr. Yates [lord Yarmouth] will be provided for, and a great
many of Mr. Kennedy's [the King's] friends advanced, after a little
time, which is a good ſign.</p>
                  <p>As for news, we have little or none. The parliament took off two
ſhillings in the pound, which will make itſelf a high church parliament.
The Whigs are mad at this, and will be more, eſpecially if the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
gives the broken officers their whole ſubſiſtance, becauſe it will
ſcreen the miniſtry and them, and what they can do. To-day or to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
it will be known what will be done in it; ſo that the Whigs will have
nothing left to ſcare the vulgar with but Popery and the Pretender, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if they can't get Hannoverſent for.</p>
                  <p>They got the higher houſe of convocation not to join the lower, in an
addreſs of thanks to her Majeſty, for the peace. There are ten biſhops
againſt the addreſs, and ſix pro; ſo that it is believed, the body of the
clergy muſt addreſs alone; they got the bank and the E. I. C. in their
hands, which make them more inſolent.</p>
                  <p>It is believed my lord Peterborough will be made duke of Monmouth,
or at leaſt, marquis.</p>
                  <p>Juſt how the houſe voted half-pay to the land and ſea officers. The
Whigs oppoſed the latter. This will make the miniſtry more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0950500102:425"/>
Notwithſtanding the uſage Egleton [the Emperor] met with here,
yet he will truſt and cringe to Quaint [princeſs Anne] and mates [miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try]
ſooner than to Knox [King of France], for he ſent one to her; pray
ſhe may moderate matters between them. He does it becauſe the
Waggs [Whigs] deſire him, and make him believe Quaint [princeſs
Anne] cannot live long, and Hall [Hannover] will come here, and things
will go to his mind in a year or two. This I know to be true. I am,

This was ſent to a bitter enemy of Overton's [Harley]: 'tis therefore I

on Egleton [the Emperor] to carry on the weather [war] hot; the Waggs

Knox [King of France], being taken up and kept in play with Egleton

Mr. Ken [the King] and his friends here would have him. Knox [King
of France] is much reflected upon, for abandoning Mr. Jenkins [the King].
'Tis mean in him to own the ſape [ſucceſſion] of Hall [Hannover] in

                  <p>One of Hungat's houſe [houſe of commons] aſked me, yeſterday, if
I could give him a true account how Mr. Ken [the King] does; ſo the
Waggs [Whigs] banter the Tanners [Tories] telling them, that he can't live
long, he is conſumptive, diſpirited, melancholy, and very infirm, ſo that
they muſt not rely on his coming home. This is the language of the Waggs
[Whigs] now daily in the houſe; and that one came from Billingford

it was a waggiſh [whiggiſh] ſtory, and not to be credited. He told me,
he was glad to hear it; and that Mr. Ken [the King] will have a ſtruggle
for him, and is more and more in their eyes.</p>

                  <p>"THE Sutlers [Scots] begin to be troubleſome. They ſeem reſolved
to break off with us, unleſs they are put on a better footing. They
all join with the Waggs [Whigs] to make Overton [Harley] ſo uneaſy,
that he will be glad to reſign in time. Some of Mr. Ken's [the King's]
friends help them behind the curtain, to pin him to the wall; for they
find 'tis the beſt way to make him do honeſt and fair things.</p>
                  <p>I have no news worth your notice, only the Scots make a noiſe.
Their repreſentatives in both houſes met in a tavern, where they were not
long, when the D. of Argyle and my lord Mar went from the lords,
Lockhart and Coulcairn from the commons, to wait on the Queen, to
tell her, they could not ſee their country ruined; and aſked her leave to
bring in a bill to diſſolve the Union. She deſired them to conſider of it
firſt; upon which, they returned and met ſeveral times ſince. My lord
Seafield moved, yeſterday, in the houſe of lords, to go upon the ſtate
of both nations. The motion was adjourned till Monday. The Whigs
are indefatigably buſy to open, as they ſay, the eyes of the people, and
give out they'll let the world know, that day, how the nation has been
impoſed upon and grieved; and give out, they'll ſend my lord treaſurer
to the Tower. But you'll find all theſe heats will end in fumes and
vapours; though the Scots ſay, they'll lay a foundation for a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernie.</p>
                  <p>Arbuthnot [lord Argyle] is night and day with the Waggs [Whigs],
who will ply Overton [Harley] very warmly. The mates [miniſters]
will connive ſo far with them, as to ſend him to Tracy [the Tower].
They won't ſee him ruined. He laughs at all this. For he has Snap
[money] and Quaint's [Queen Anne's] favour to bring him off. I can

                  <p>I am told, by a good hand, Arbuth. [lord Argyle] will be turned out
of his all. Newam, alias Dan, will have the ſtature-middle [privy ſeal],
and the gold [government] put into the hands of Charles [the High
church] and his [its] friends.</p>
                  <p>The friends of Hall [Hannover] are upiſh, and think the day will be
their own. They wrote to him lately, that the mates [miniſters] and
Quaint [princeſs Anne] are on a tottering foundation, and will break
Overton's [Harley's] neck; of which I gave him an account, two days
ago, and that Strange [P. Sophia] will never ſide with the Tanners
[Tories], nor abandon the Waggs [Whigs]; this I hinted as well to
Beaumont [lord Mulgrave], who ſeemed well pleaſed with it. This ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates

I believed he didn't want any aid or aſſiſtance in any thing, ſince he has

                  <p>"SIR Thomas Hanmer was ſent over, in 1712, to the D. of Ormond
(whoſe relation and friend he was) in Flanders, and after that came
to Paris, where he was received, by the King of France's order, like a
prince. Never had a private man ſuch honours paid him.</p>
                  <p>There, he put the laſt hand to the Treaty of Commerce; which very
treaty, he afterwards, when ſpeaker, uſed his intereſt to throw out.</p>
                  <p>When that treaty was to come before the houſe, and ſeveral debates
had been held on it, juſt as the laſt debate for the final determination of
the affair came on, the earl of Oxford wrote a letter, as L. L. told me
April 23d 1724, to Mr. Bromley, telling him, that he would, by no means,
be an occaſion of a breach among friends: that he would willingly let all the
blame lie upon himſelf, and the treaty be given up, rather than make a
diviſion. Nor would there have been a diviſion in the houſe that day,
had not Sir Richard Vyvian got up and ſaid, that he had ſtudied the
point of commerce: that he found the treaty admirably calculated for
the advantage of England, and he had grounded his notion on the beſt
informations; and that he could not bear to ſee a matter given up,
out of a compliment to any body's notions, when his country was to
receive a prejudice by it; and he laid the foundation of a debate, which
laſted till 2 in the morning, being carried on purely on a country-foot,
and the treaty rejected, by only about 8 votes. Lord L. dined that day
with lord Oxford, who was ſurpriſed to hear, that the houſe was ſitting
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0950500102:438"/>
at nine o'clock, and could not imagine how it happened, nor did then
take a ſtep to carry the point; whereas, as lord L. told me, had he but
ſent a note to his brother Ned, or couſin Tom Harley, the court intereſt,
which was neuter, would have fallen in with the country, and the treaty
would have certainly been ratified: ſo that this point was left, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
prejudice of England, only out of a compliment of the earl of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
to Sir Thomas Hanmer.</p>
                  <p>A. O. told me, Sir T. Hanmer and the B. of R. were the two perſons

He ſpeaks himſelf with reſpect of Mr. Philips [lord Middleton]; but
told her of what I ſhall tell you on the other ſide of this; and the young

told him, if my lord Middleton was faithful to the King, he
was falſe to the King of France; and he that is here, I mean D. D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,
is of the ſame opinion as he ſays, or words to that effect, But it
was not lord Fingale that told me that. The duke of Powis told me, he
did not ſpeak or truſt himſelf to my lord Middleton's ſons, and repeated
only at large, that there were ſtrange reports of my lord Middleton.
When Mr. Rogers comes, he will tell you more; but be ſure not to take
notice you have heard any thing from me.</p>
                  <p>All will go well for the King, when the parliament meets again. She
[princeſs Anne] has a rupture in her belly, and is dangerouſly ill, but
goes about her chamber.</p>
                  <p>The propoſal of this perſon to the King, to come incognito, is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and fooliſh. The parliament will do it, if ſhe lives long enough
to let it ſit. But the terms will be cruel, and unfit to take; but if once
in poſſeſſion, the power of altering, in time, will of courſe follow.</p>
                  <p>The thing [the late addreſſes] that paſſed the parliament has no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.
My lord Fingale ſpoke to the Lorrain envoy. He ſaid he
was ſent to princeſs Anne, not to the parliament; ſo ſhould take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
unleſs ſhe ſpoke to him. All the reſt of the miniſters ſee it was a
trick of the Whigs, to get an advantage in the elections, and the Tories
would not have let it paſs; but, with a ſneer and a laugh, paſſed it.</p>

                  <p>"ASSURE Mr. Philips [lord Middleton] of my zealous ſervice, and
let him know I ſhall manage this affair, ſo as he ſhall have full
power to juſtify himſelf; but I beg, at preſent, he will take no notice of
what I write. Rogers is intruſted, by the perſon I have named, that told
me what Mr. Jacob's [King of France's] firſt man told him; and, to do
that perſon juſtice, he ſaid he did believe Mr. Philips [lord Middleton]
to be a man of honour. I cannot find yet, if he has told the ſame to any
other perſon than Mrs. White. Rogers has told her ſeveral times, that
he feared an ill character of Mr. Philips [lord Middleton], in regard to
Mr. Jenkins [the King]. She aſſured him it was groundleſs malice.
Then he repeated, that he was the cauſe of Mr. Hamilton's leaving Mr.
Jenkins [the King]. So ſhe concluded it was from that, that the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
report came; but now ſhe finds that it came both ways. Mr.
Rogers is an ill figure of a man, and as ill an utterance; but what he has
fallen into, by chance, is very extraordinary, and I believe that filly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
has been of great help to him, in doing what he has done. I
believe you will ſay what he has writ was well done, and like a man of a
better appearance. He will be ſerviceable when at the great town [Paris],
and Mr. Harris [Harley] will ſee what he ſends, and ſupply him in the
factory. He is honeſt. The traffick will require Mr. Philip's [lord
Middleton's] and your head to manage. He has promiſed me to have
to do with no other, in this traffick, but your friend [he means my lord
Middleton] and you. Mr. Peregrine [Ferguſon] would have him to trade
with Mr. St. [Stafford], that is, with Mrs. Rachell [the Queen]; and the
perſon I have named would have him trade with Mr. Ineſe, who he trades
with; but he aſſures me he will attend Mrs. Philips [my lady Middleton],
and by her, trade with Mrs. Racheil [the Queen], and then buy and
ſell by Mr. Philip's [lord Middleton's] and your direction. It is odd that
Peregrine [Mr. Ferguſion] ſhould have, under Mr. Jenkins's [the King's]
hand, to be one of the factors for preſent chalk [caſh], one of his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:0950500102:443"/>
for none here will deal with him in that way, he is ſo indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and other things alledged. I believe very well of him; but many
others do not. What I name of the fifty pounds given, muſt not be
named, only to know if that perſon has ever acknowledged to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that ſum of the man I have named; for he ſcorns to name it
only to know if it be approved his giving it ſo; becauſe he pretends to
have direction to be one of the factors named to receive an account of
trade for Mr. Jenkins [the King]; he would have had as much more ſince.
This perſon would have refuſed a thouſand pounds himſelf, or two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
a-year to the fund, if there had been a compliance from others of
the manufactory. What he wants in underſtanding the trade, he makes
up in zeal and bravery of ſpirit for the good of the company. What I
mean, of not knowing he has told any other than Mrs. White is, I cannot
prove he has, though I don't doubt but he has, becauſe of the report
being ſpread; though yet I cannot fix it on any particular perſon, that
has been told it by him. You will judge, when you ſee Mr. Rogers,
what is fit to let him know; ſince thoſe he will deal with here, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
Mr. Harris [Harley] with what he writes; for they are at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to all intents; and he not at all a friend, only will have it in his
power at once, if he finds it will be ſo without him, to ſeem to have had
always the intention, and waited for an opportunity; for that is the true
character of Mr. Harris [Harley]. I find that Mr. Innes, I have named,
is no friend to Mr. Philips [my lord Middleton], and I am ſure thoſe of
his character do Mr. Jenkins [the King] great injury, by being with him
at this time, and his not being in their hands, as his father was, has done
him a great ſervice; ſo that his being there is not well. I deſire Mrs.
Philips [my lady Middleton] will receive Rogers well, and not think worſe
of him for his figure. I wiſh Mr. Philips [lord Middleton] would write
himſelf a kind letter to Mr. Aſkine [lord Ayleſbury], my friend, that was
at Bruſſels, who is now at Paris, and ill of an ulcer in his bladder. He has
long taken it ill he did not anſwer his letters, which is the reaſon he does
not write there, though he is ſtill the ſame. Mr. Ford [my lord Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort]
has been once to ſee my friend [lord Ayleſbury], and he returned
it, but no more friendſhip will ever be betwixt them. I do not know if
Mr. Rogers can ſupport himſelf, or if he expects to have a conſideration
from thoſe concerned, who are to reap the benefit. I believe Mr. Harris
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:0950500102:444"/>
[Harley] will take care, under-hand: for, by what I have found out, he
is at the bottom; but I am fully perſuaded Rogers is truly zealous for
the good of the manufactory, and indeed every action has proved it; and
the uſe that can be made will be of conſequence. Adieu.</p>
                  <p>I aſſure you, you are not miſtaken in your friend Mr. Bartheleme [Mr.
Mathews<note n="†" place="bottom">Perhaps the duke of Buckingham.</note>]; he is your real, hearty ſervant, and will be what he was again.

                  <p>"I Have ſpoken to lord Fingale. He has told me three things alledged
againſt my lord Middleton. One, that when F. Plowden was ſent
on the King's buſineſs, another father of theirs was taken in Flanders;
and when they found it was not Plowden, they let him go, and that my
lord Middleton was the man that knew of this buſineſs. The ſecond
thing was, that young Sheridan told my lord, that his father was ſent to
the Elector of Cologne, who promiſed to aſſiſt the King with money: but
when Sheridan came, he ſhuffled him off, becauſe he found all deſigns
were diſcovered to thoſe here. The third was, that a letter ſent by
duke Hamilton, was ſent back to the prince of Orange, and that he
ſhewed it him, and, in a pleaſant manner, bid him do ſo no more. My
lord aſked the duke himſelf, if this was true; who anſwered, it was falſe,
and ſpoke of my lord Middleton with reſpect, and not at all ſo of my
lord Melfort. That of Monſieur Pontchartrain I find my lord Fingale
ſpoke of to the Queen: but ſhe told him he [Pontchartrain] was angry
with my lord Middleton, and was a paſſionate man; but he [lord Fingale]
did not ſpeak to her [the Queen] in the very bare terms he [Pontchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train]
ſpoke them to him [lord Fingale], which were as I writ them in my
laſt. But now this lord is convinced, that all this is occaſioned by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and deſigns, and deſires, that my lord Middleton will be pleaſed to
ſend him his inſtructions, what the King would have moved in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
this next ſeſſion: for ſeveral of the houſe, that deſire to be choſen
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0950500102:445"/>
again, deſire him to know what the King would have them do, and they
will do it. Sir John Packington has promiſed to be the leading man, and
the reſt promiſe to ſecond it, and I know ſeverals that ſay they will. Sir
William Whitlock ſays, he will, who is a leading man. If the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
of it, they will call for the box, where the names of thoſe are, whom
princeſs Sophia ſent to be commiſſioned to have the government in their
hands, till ſhe could come after the death of princeſs Anne. This was ſent
when they thought her a dying; and then the parliament, if the box be
produced, will declare againſt the choice, as men that are againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and will take the occaſion to prove, that there are a number
of Papiſts in employments in that ſtate, and that they have built them a
church; and then prove all the diſreſpectful things which that court has
done againſt princeſs Anne and the preſent miniſtry, and, by degrees, fall
on the ſucceſſion; which, if the parliament is as they expect, will be as
good as the old."</p>

                  <p>"MOST tenants are diſpoſed pretty well,<note place="margin">Original.</note> if Mr. Harris [Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley]
would once reſolve it was to be done;<note place="margin">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. iv. 4 to No. 46.</note> but he will keep in
with both. Thoſe five, [Sunderland, Somers, Halifax, Cowper, and
Ruſſel,] he met, and, as I told you in a former letter, he is in cloſe
counſel with, and does many things by their inſtigation. The book-keeper
that was with Mr. Jacob [lord Bolingbroke] he would have out of the
office, and give him a place of more profit; but he will not change, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knows what he means by it; if the laws do go for Mr. Jenkins
[the King], and that all the management cannot hinder him, then he
[Mr. Harley] will appear as a main witneſs, elſe he has taken ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
as will juſtify him, and will have thoſe five perſons to prove how he
concerted all thoſe things for the good of Mr. Sandy [Hannover], tho'
he did not believe him his friend; and this is what that perſon who is
hourly with him [lord Fingale] ſays of him. He is ſo afraid of Mr. Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecote
[the parliament], he dare not do more for Mr. Sandy [Hannover]
openly; but he renders all things of no effect, that is offered as to his
prejudice, and ſtill gives a politic reaſon for it, that every one in his
club clearly ſees what he aims at. That princeſs Anne's ſpeech, at going
away of Mr. Medlecote [the parliament], was ſo ordered, he could not
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0950500102:446"/>
help her ſaying what ſhe did; becauſe he that it belonged to ſo to order
it, had contrived to have it ſo, and argued the point to Mrs. Anne Smith
[princeſs Anne]. As ſhe conſented, ſo he could not change it, though
he attempted it. I ſpoke to you before of Mr. Rogers; he is, I do truly
believe, an honeſt man. Mr. Harris [Mr. Harley] does certainly know of
his journey, further than the great town [Paris], though it is his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
that does employ him. Mr. Rogers will clear this point to you.
The parſon [lord Fingall] I have named to have told me this, in regard
of Mr. Philips [lord Middleton], is no man of great parts, but moſt
zealouſly honeſt to his friend and relation [the King]; his wife, who is at
the great town [Paris], has ſent to him to come, and ſays that Mr. Ford's
broker [lord Melfort], that was the firſt about Mr. St. John's [the duke
of Perth], deſires him to come to him; he laughs with me at that, and
ſaid he thinks it was a great way to go to make him a viſit: he ſaid he was
intimate with his brother [lord Melfort]; but never was but three times
with him [duke of Perth]. He does not ſay his brother [lord Melfort]
did tell him any thing I have writ; it was what I could not in manners
aſk him. I find Parker was well acquainted with him, who he thinks
mad. All I could ſay I did, to undeceive thoſe that had handed thoſe
malicious reports on hearſay, to come to a juſter opinion.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laur [Sir Conſtantine Phips], that was my council, that is not
here now, I have heard from lately, by one that came from him; he is
ſincerely a friend to Mr. Jenkins [the King], and deſires he may know
he is ſo. He has gained great reputation where he is.</p>
                  <p>Pray, with my moſt faithful ſervice, aſſure Mr. Philips [lord Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton]
that none on earth more truly honours him; that I beg he will be
pleaſed, by you, to direct you to write ſuch a letter, as I may ſhow the
perſon I have named [lord Fingall]; only thus, in anſwer to my letter.
He gave me leave to deſire him to give me ſuch directions as were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
that he may deliver to thoſe of Mr. Medlecote's family [the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament],
as I have here named; what I have told, in relation to Mr.
Philips [lord Middleton] himſelf, he has not given me leave yet to tell
him; but he ſaid, after ſome time, he would give me leave to acquaint
him, for it was unjuſt that ſuch fort of reports ſhould not be cleared,
and that he was for what was juſt, and then what was moſt proper to be
done to cultivate all the family's intereſt together; for that was the way
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0950500102:447"/>
to do ſomething effectually; for this is the time before the next term, for
all depends upon it. All has been trifling till now, it is come to the
deciſion of all. If this time be loſt, there will be but an ill proſpect of
recovering the eſtate. Mr. Rogers is obliged to be where Mrs. Rachel is
[at Paris], for ſome time before he can ſee Mr. St. Johns [the King]; for
there is ſomething to be done there that will regard Mr. Harris [Harley],

have upon Everard [the Elections], either by themſelves, or by relations

to unite with Charles's [Queen's] lawyers, and be directed by them, in

                  <p>"I Am ſorry to find you lay ſo much ſtreſs upon Mr. Smith's [the
King's] living [being] or not living [being] in Forbes's [catholic]
family, as if the iſſue of his law ſuit depended upon it, when Mr. Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
[E. Mar] himſelf knows, that it would be againſt all law to caſt him
upon that account; ſince therefore, you have been ſo plain with me, upon
this ſubject, confiding in your friendſhip, I will uſe the ſame freedom
with you, in telling you my thoughts of this matter.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, if Smith's friends require this condition from him,
they do him no favour; for he could compound, at that rate, with his
greateſt enemies, and with Cramond himſelf [the Whigs].</p>
                  <p>In the next place, living or not living with Forbes, muſt be a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
act of one's own free choice, otherwiſe it cannot anſwer the ends for
which it is required. It would be but cheating and impoſing upon one
another, which is neither Smith nor Cant's [Church of England's] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                  <p>If Smith be willing, on one ſide, as certainly he is, to give Cant's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
all the marks of favour and friendſhip, that can be aſked of him,
for the benefit of the family, I think it a little hard, on the other ſide, that
Cant [church of England] ſhould not allow him the liberty that all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have, to live where he pleaſes, and to follow his own judgment, in a
thing that relates only perſonally to himſelf, and can be of no real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to Cant.</p>
                  <p>If he were to trade with a Cramond [Whiggiſh] mob, I ſhould not
wonder at any hardſhip of that kind, from ſuch people. But I hope
Cant's [church of England's] relations are men of too good principles,
to refuſe the liberty to Smith himſelf, which he is willing and ready to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to all their family, in the ſtrongeſt and moſt authentic manner that
they themſelves can deſire.</p>
                  <p>They own, that the juſtice of the cauſe in queſtion, is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant
of Mr. Talbot [religion]; therefore, to deal juſtly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0950500102:456"/>
with Smith, they ſhould begin by deciding his law ſuit; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he is in peaceable poſſeſſion of his eſtate, then he and Cant [church of
England] may talk of Talbot's concerns [religion], with more honour
and freedom, and leſs ſuſpicion of being biaſſed by views of intereſt, than
at preſent.</p>
                  <p>I muſt tell you, that I know Smith to be very nice upon that point:
for, if it were to receive a crown, he would not do a thing that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
either his honour or his ſincerity. He deſires a union of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
friendſhip, and intereſt, with Cant [church of England], above all
things, becauſe he thinks him an honeſt man, and they may be mutually
uſeful to one another. For that reaſon, he ſeeks all occaſions to oblige
him, and to make all thoſe of his relations that are with him, eaſy; and
it is for their ſatisfaction, that he has brought a perſon lately into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
who has free liberty to ſerve them, in their own way.</p>
                  <p>He had reaſon to hope, that Cant would be ſatisfied with this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his good-will towards him; and that in return, he would be as eaſy
to him, as he has been to his relations; but, inſtead of that, he has met
with more uneaſineſs, upon that ſubject, than he had before; what he
meant only for the comfort and ſatisfaction of his friends having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
beyond what he intended, which has drawn ſeveral unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
teazings upon him, on one ſide, and occaſioned raſh judgments, on
the other. He cannot help people's ſpeaking; but it were to be wiſhed,
at leaſt, that his friends had ſpoke of Talbot [religion] and him with
more caution and prudence than they have done. For their late reports
have done him no good; on the contrary, they have expoſed him to be
looked upon, as a wavering, intereſted, and diſſembling ſpirit, which is
quite the reverſe of his character.</p>
                  <p>I muſt deſire you, therefore, as you love Smith's intereſt and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to uſe your endeavours to ſilence their groundleſs reports, wherever
you perceive they may do him harm, and to prevail all you can with
Cant's [church of England's] chief relations, not to teaze upon Forbes's
[catholic] account, in ſo unſeaſonable a conjuncture as this is. Let them
aſk for themſelves whatever they pleaſe. He loves them ſo well, that
he will refuſe them nothing that can tend to make them happy and ſecure
them in their eſtates. This which he hath ſo often promiſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:0950500102:457"/>
ſtill, in due time, to perform, ſhould be ſufficient, and to aſk more,
eſpecially at this time, would neither be friendly nor juſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, having told you freely my mind, I hope you will make
your own prudent uſe of it, and employ your intereſt, when occaſion
offers, with Ord [princeſs Anne], Jones [Harley], Bambery [St. John],
and others of your friends, in caſe any of them have any good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Smith [the King], to perſuade them to be contented to trade with
him upon the foot here mentioned, which is certainly the ſureſt for both
ſides; for whatever he promiſes they may depend upon, nor will he leave
it, even in his own power to deceive them. Whereas, if he ſhould, at
this ſuſpicious time, part with his old friend Forbes [Catholic] ſo eaſily,
or be any ways moved thereto by the motives repreſented to him, by Mr.
Anderſon, it would not be prudent in any of his new friends, to truſt him
half ſo much, as they may ſafely do, remaining as he is, eſpecially when
he offers to give them all the demonſtrations of his friendſhip, firmneſs,
and ſincerity, that conſcience and honour will allow him."</p>

ſetting that aſide, it is equal to them, whether this or that perſon is put

to no purpoſe, you have heard, addreſſed, to have you removed.
This, the Tories, though they could not refuſe to join in it, being near
the time of electing a new ſenate, only laughed at them for: for when
the addreſſes were preſented to the Queen, that of the upper houſe was
attended only, by five or ſix Whig lords; that of the lower, by twenty
Whig ſenators. This I write, that you may know how well people ſeem
to be inclined; and that you may make reflections as you think fit."</p>

He tells me, the houſe of commons will let no prime miniſter govern
for the future, but manage the main point, and make the crown depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
on them. They will give money to have a ſhare of it themſelves;
by this he gives to underſtand, that if Knox [the King of France] would
but ſend his agent over ſoon with a good ſpell, Mr. Kennedy [the King]
might ſoon go home. They are hungry; a pound now will go further
than ten another time. I gave de Torcy an account of all this matter;
but I believe it will be to little or no purpoſe; for it is a maxim with
him, not to believe Mr. Kennedy [the King's] friends.</p>
                  <p>I continue to fix Mrs. Strange [princeſs Sophia] againſt Overton [Mr.
Harley] and he againſt her. I wrote him, laſt night, that I ſaw a letter
from her and her ſon, which ſays, he is a worthleſs hollow-fellow. She
complains the Engliſh do not go much near her now, of late.</p>
                  <p>Noble [Mr. Netterville] tells me, in his letters, the parliament will put
in the Queen's power to name her ſucceſſor; and if ſhe lives a little longer
Hannover will never ſee England. The duke of Berwick will be here
the next week. I am to go to De Torcy with him, and tell him what's
proper, and tell him what orders I have from England; doubtleſs, he
won't be againſt my going to ſee you there. Noble [Netterville] truly
tells me, that it is but curioſity of both ſides; therefore, is not very fond
of my going yet, till he ſees how matters go. The parliament will be
very active and ſtirring. The treaſurer and miniſtry look on the German
miniſter, reſiding in England with ſuch diſdain and contempt, and he on
them, that they are ready to fly in one anothers faces when they meet.
The Whigs call themſelves the church Tories, to deceive the people;
but they get no profit by it. Queen is now very well; but the Whigs
ſay ſhe will die next winter, and gives the Emperor hopes Hannover
will come over; for they tell them, the moment the church party goes
about to ſet aſide the ſucceſſion, or declares for the Pretender, the mob
will come over to them, as they did to the Tories in Sacheverel's time.
This they write abroad daily to their correſpondents here and elſewhere,
I am, &amp;c."</p>

                  <p>Nairne wrote, at full length, the article about religion, in this letter to
Berry, as follows.</p>
                  <p>—"I Am glad to hear that Kelly [the King's] friendſhip for all Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock's

that way, and that he will never refuſe to comply with any innocent
lawful means, to ſatisfy Edwards [the Engliſh] upon Roſs's account [re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion];
but he hopes, from all his true friends and well wiſhers, that
they will uſe all their endeavours to hinder his being preſſed to explain
himſelf perſonally upon that gentleman's ſubject, at this time, becauſe he
is convinced that even a compliance of hearing only, at this time, would
reflect upon his honour and ſincerity; upon which two points, he is nice
to the laſt degree, as all honeſt men are and ought to be; and indeed
Wanly [the Whigs] has ſufficiently publiſhed beforehand, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
the world would put upon an explanation made in this juncture
of time; ſo that, (as Arnot ſays very well) the diſcreteſt and moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
thing for Edwards [the Engliſh], is to leave that matter to time
and providence; for if Wheatly's [the Engliſh] happineſs and Cary's
[clergyman's] ſecurity be ſettled, this is all that Edwards [the Engliſh] is
properly concerned in, and what he can be infinitely ſurer of, in dealing
with a perſon, whoſe veracity is proof of the greateſt worldly temptations,
than if that perſon ſhould, by a precipitated unſeaſonable compliance,
give but too juſt a handle to ſuſpect him of diſſimulation."</p>

try what time, patience, and all good offices, on his ſide, will produce;
leaving (as you ſay very well) the event to God Almighty, and to
Charles's [princeſs Anne] and Honiton's [Harley's] conſciences. But
when Proby [the parliament] comes to town, we ſhall be better able to

occurrences: That the Emperor and Dutch ſcorned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
of late the Queen and her miniſters. He will give Oftend and
all the towns in Flanders to the Dutch, becauſe he thinks he will vex the
Engliſh. The Whigs are ſo ſowered againſt the Tories now, that they
want but ſtrength to riſe up in arms. They gave out lately, through the
three kingdoms, the Pretender was turned proteſtant, to feel the pulſe of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:0950500102:465"/>
the Tories; but, having gained no point by it, they now ſay it was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from Lorrain, and the contrary was wrote from Bar. They brag
they have a faction ſtrong enough, if not to bring over Hannover, to
keep out the Pretender at leaſt this ſeſſion; in the mean time, the Queen
may die. They'll get the Emperor to hold out another campaign. They
contrive to advance him money, as they have done already. They think
to put the miniſtry on ſome extreme, and on a neceſſity to call France
to their aſſiſtance, and conſequently bring home the Pretender, hoping
thereby to get the people of their ſide, as the Tories got them by Dr.
Sacheverel's trial.</p>
                  <p>The miniſtry, now ſeeing they can't bring the Emperor to a peace,
concluded to ſend Shrewſbury to call a parliament in Ireland, to ſit at
the ſame time with that of England; a thing not uſual. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
now to go through ſtich with the changes through the three king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
Tney muſt now ſink or ſwim with France. The Whigs know it,
and will puſh them on to it, in order to ruin the Tories; but all to no
purpoſe. They perſuade the German miniſters at London, the Emperor
may have the ſame terms after the next campaign as now. If he loſes
ground, the balance is loſt; therefore, the miniſtry muſt get him the
ſame terms that was offered at Utrecht, or elſe the people will fly in their
faces, and oblige them to renew the war, to ſecure the balance of power.
Theſe arguments, however chimerical in themſelves, make an impreſſion
on the Germans, and leave a ſting in the minds of the people.</p>
                  <p>Marlborough deſires to go and live in England this winter; but the
Queen can't as much as hear him named. Some few attempted to keep
the princeſs Sophia's birth-day; but they were affronted. There was
but one flag hung out of one ſteeple in all the town: a good ſign. The
Scots commoners half mild, half ſtale. The lords right: money will gain
them at any time. Argyle will be ſoon turned out, and his employment
given to honeſt men.</p>
                  <p>The treaſurer is mortified at the Emperor, and the Dutch proceedings.
He foreſees he can't, as he deſired, renew an alliance with them, or bring
them into his meaſures. The factions were never ſeen ſo high as now.
There will be warm doings in both houſes. How the treaſurer ſhall ſtem
the current, you ſhall know per next, from, &amp;c."</p>

only chooſe a ſpeaker, and perhaps paſs the bill of commerce. The
Scotch commons are moſt of them Whigs; but the lords have the power
of that kingdom in their hands. The parliament of Ireland moſtly
Whigs. Their friends in England will aſſiſt to thwart the meaſures of
the court and embarraſs matters. They continue to perſuade the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to offer his niece to the prince of Piedmont, in hopes to get the D.
of Savoy into the alliance again, and make him hold out two campaigns
more. By that time, they hope, either the Queen or the King of France
may drop off, and they'll get a great point by it. They are alarmed more

earneſtly deſired to get myſelf introduced to the miniſters of Savoy
and Bavaria and other Roman Catholic miniſters reſiding here; and if
they have any confidence in me, I ſhall have meaſures ſent me, from time
to time, to communicate to them, that may be uſeful to their maſters and
ſubſervient to the conſul's intereſt. I know, Sir, the men in power
would be glad thoſe of his ſtamp did contribute to reſtore him to his
conſulſhip, though they dare not appear in the matter bare-facedly, much
leſs truſt any of thoſe foreigners in the circumſtances they are now in;
but, as it is a nice thing, I ſhall not proceed in it, till I know the conſul's
ſentiments of the matter; beſides, none of theſe foreigners will truſt me,
unleſs I be introduced to them by thoſe that has intereſt with them: but
we muſt not loſe much time: for I find, by my accounts from home, the
conſul's friends begin to be more active, and deſign to bring things to
bear ſooner than it was firſt propoſed. I am deſired again to tell you,
Sir, that all thoſe at the helm are unanimouſly for the conſul, and my
friend will anſwer for it, with his blood. I have no news to ſend you;
but that I ſaw letters from Hannover, which ſay, the Elector will not
ſend his ſon to England till he is invited by the Queen and parliament;
nor will he believe what they ſay to him, unleſs they do it, or that they
mean him well. He falls in with the ſentiments of Whigs, and acts by
their directions. I gave a hint of this to my correſpondent, who will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it to the conſul's advantage. I have given ſeveral hints of the
kind of late, that did put ſome people of power on the tantrums, and
made them jealous of each other, and will ſpur them on to ſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
better than they have done hitherto; to put them out of their road, I

common one, and won't be beat out of it, but they may be ſpurred on
in it. You ſhall have timely notice what to do in it, when matters are
ripe. I am deſired to tell the conſul, that he muſt not give ear to the
many ſcribblers, that pretend to things they know nothing of, for they do
but miſlead you and impoſe on you there. I gave the papers to Mr.
Innes, and deſired him to give them into the conſul's own hands, and, if
he deſired it, to read them to him; and then that you make your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.
And I hope the conſul won't let them go out of his own
hands, or ſuffer copies to be taken of them, but after he has peruſed them
to lock them up till I ſee him: for they will be of uſe to him hereafter;
depend on it. I ſhall ſend you more in a few days, and let you know
the ſenſe of great many of them. If the right uſe was made of them,
the conſul might be at home ere now. I wrote, almoſt every poſt, to
my correſpondent there; but don't acknowledge the receipt of them. I
would not have him ſmell a rat, becauſe it might prejudice the conſul's
intereſt. I expect the key you promiſed to ſend, Sir, to your true friend

in England.</head>
                  <p>"ROGERS having, for ſome years, been educated in Gerard's houſe
[Germany], Mr. Egleton [the Emperor] recommended him to
Mrs. Strange [princeſs Sophia], who recommended him to ſome of our
friends among the Waggs [Whigs], and Egleton [the Emperor] like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
recommended him to his agent, then reſiding in Evelin's houſe
[England]. This gave the ſaid Rogers an opportunity to contract a
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:0950500102:471"/>
friendſhip and intimacy with the ſaid agent, and the men of buſineſs
among the Waggs [Whigs], whereby he had an opportunity of ſerving
Mr. Jenkins [the King], when Quaint [princeſs Anne] made the late regulation.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Rogers having, by his daily converſation with Quack [Mr.
Pen a Quaker], Noble [Netterville], and others, that were very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
with Overton [Mr. Harley] and the reſt of his brethren, found their
pulſe beat very low, and that they were at a loſs to maintain the new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation; and it was therefore they careſſed the agents of Egleton [the
Emperor], and Simon's houſe [Savoy], to bring them into their intereſt,
in order for a pardon general [a general peace] with Knox [the King of
France], excluſive of Duncan [the Dutch.]</p>
                  <p>Rogers, perceiving this would prejudice the intereſts of Jenkins [the
King], found ways and means to fruſtrate their deſign, which he brought
about in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>He being very intimate with one of the ſharpers of Egleton's agent
[ſecretary of the Emperor's ambaſſador], who was maſter of all his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry
[ſecrets], got a precept [a paper] which contained in ſubſtance,
that the Tanners [Tories] careſſed the ſaid agent [miniſter] then more
than ever, making him great offers, in caſe he would join with them as
above: but he aſſured his maſter Egleton [the Emperor] that ſuch great
offers of the Tanners [Tories] were an infallible ſign they were not in a
condition to ſtand their ground long, and aſſuring him the Waggs
[Whigs] had laid ſuch a foundation as would turn the ſtream into its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
channel; and that there was no reaſon to apprehend the Tanners
[Tories] would dare to deal ſeparately with Knox [King of France], or
run the riſque of giving any jealouſy to Anabaptiſts [the allies], or offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the men worthy [the mob].</p>
                  <p>Rogers, after having got this precept [paper] in his hand, did ſignify
to Noble, Quack, and Overton [Netterville, Quaker Pen, and Mr.
Harley] that the Waggs [the Whigs], in conjunction with the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
[the allies], were reſolved to ſupplant Quaint [princeſs Anne] and
him, and alſo that it was in his power to let him know all their ſophiſtries
[ſecrets]; telling withal, that his chief aim in this was purely to ſerve
Mr. Jenkins [the King], Whereupon Harris [Harley] anſwered, that
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:0950500102:472"/>
he did not diſlike his fidelity to his friends, aſſuring him that he ſhould
find his account in what ſervice he ſhould do for him and Quaint [the
Queen].</p>
                  <p>Hereupon Rogers gave him the aforeſaid precept [paper], and all the
precepts [papers] that the agent ſent to Egleton [the Emperor] and Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
[the Dutch], from time to time, to the number of about twenty-four;
containing, in ſubſtance, the ſchemes they had laid for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the weather hot [war] or cold. In order thereunto, the agent prepared
a memorandum to be given in Egleton's [the Emperor's] name, to
Quaint [princeſs Anne]; ſetting forth, that he could raiſe treble the allen
[army] he had hitherto. <hi>Nota bene,</hi> that the Agent, at the ſame time,
adviſed his maſter to make large promiſes, till he could gain his point in
Evelin's houſe [England]; and afterwards, that ways may be found to
evade the performance of them with credit.</p>
                  <p>Which was to be printed and publiſhed, in order to gain the men
worthy [mob], and exaſperate them againſt Quaint [the princeſs], Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
[Harley], and his brethren; and another precept [paper], giving
an account that Simon's houſe [Savoy] would ſtick no longer to Egleton's
[the Emperor's] intereſt, but would look to himſelf; and another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
[paper], ſent from Riſton [the King of Portugal] to Egleton [the
Emperor], importing that he would follow Quaint's [the princeſs Anne's]
ſteps. Another precept [paper], propoſing a method of removing
Quaint [princeſs Anne] out of truſt [the throne]; and another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
[paper], containing a method how to prolong the weather hot [war]
for two years longer. Theſe, with many other matters, too long to
mention here, being given by Rogers to Harris [Harley], made ſuch
impreſſion on Quaint [princeſs Anne], and Overton [Harley], that they
immediately reſolved upon dealing even ſeparately with Knox [King of
France].</p>
                  <p>Rogers, perceiving the agent to be dejected upon account of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſlighted on this occaſion, diſcourſed with him as uſually, and made
a bye motion to him to reconcile him to Kennedy's [the King's] intereſt;
but he being ſo much elated by the repeated aſſurances of the Waggs
[Whigs], refuſed to favour it. Whereupon Rogers attacked him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
way, and told him there was a project ſet on foot by Lewis [old
Danby], Overton [Harley], and the reſt of the ſociety, to marry Mr.
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:0950500102:473"/>
Kemp's [the King's ſiſter] to Knell [the King of Sweden]; and, by that
means, to reſtore him, excluſive of Mrs. Strange [the princeſs Sophia].</p>
                  <p>The agent communicated this to his chief confidents among the Waggs
[the Whigs], who were ſo alarmed at it, that they raiſed all the Devils
in Hell to prevent it, and ſaid, that of the two evils, they would rather
have Jenkins [the King], though a phyſician [a Roman Catholic], than
that ſuch a project ſhould take, which would knock all their meaſures
down at once, and ruin for ever them and their friends the Anabaptiſts
[the allies].</p>
                  <p>Whereupon they ſent to Hall [Hannover], that he would ſend his
agent immediately to Evelin's houſe [England], to take care of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;
who, thereupon, gave in a memorandum, which ſerved Quaint
[the princeſs Anne], Cleveland [cabinet council], and the partners [par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament]
to a great degree never to be forgotten. Beaumont [lord Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave],
Segrave [lord Shrewſbury], and the reſt of the ſociety, except
Overton [Harley], were of opinion that the agent ſhould be ſent away
with Moulins [a meſſenger], but Overton [Harley] ſaid it was not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
for ſeveral reaſons: Firſt, becauſe the pardon general [general
peace], was not ſo far advanced as to rely upon Knox [King of France]:
ſecondly, that it would give a great cauſe of jealouſy to the men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
[the mob], which may draw them away; and thirdly, becauſe it
would make the jewellers [Jacobites] inſolent, and give Kemp [the King]
greater hopes of eſtabliſhing his intereſt than otherwiſe he could expect.
Upon theſe reaſons that buſineſs dropt.</p>
                  <p>The Waggs [Whigs] finding that the memorandum had not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
propoſed by it, they ſent to Evers [prince Eugene] to come with all
ſpeed to Evelin's houſe [England], in order to lay before Quaint [prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
Anne] and partners [parliament] the neceſſity of continuing the
weather hot [war], and how Knox [King of France] bought the pardon
general [peace] for maps [money]; to retrieve which, the Waggs
[Whigs] were ſure to carry the point, by the majority they aſſured
themſelves in Holton [houſe of Lords] and Hungate [houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons],
by ſending two or three of Clevland [cabinet council] to Tracy
[the Tower of London.]</p>
                  <p>Rogers having an indenture [intelligence] of all this from Egleton's
[Emperor's] agent, then living at Hatton's houſe [the Hague], gave the

ſaid indenture to Overton [Harley], and the reſt of his brethren; upon
which, Moulſworth [lord Churchill] was laid aſide, which mightily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
Evers [prince Eugene] at his arrival. Upon this, Moulſworth
[lord Churchill] told Ivers [prince Eugene], that had he come before
the new dozen were made in Holton [houſe of lords], all would do well,
and that now more violent meaſures muſt be uſed rather than fail; which
Ivers [prince Eugene] agreed to conſult with Jonathan [the junto] and
partners. Whereupon he propoſed to gather together a great many of
the men worthy [mob] to be led by ſome of Jonathan [the junto] and
partners, (to deſtroy in the night-time, after a frolickſome manner)
Overton [Harley], Hervy [Sir Simon Harcourt], and one or two of his
principal companions: but Hall's [Hannover's] agent, did not approve
of this method, conceiving it would turn the hearts of the men worthy
[mob] againſt his maſter, but Jonathan [the junto] and partners being
divided in this:</p>
                  <p>Ivers [prince Eugene] propoſed another way, which was to ſet fire
to ſeveral houſes in Little Town [London], and eſpecially near South's
houſe [St. James's]; and, by this means, raiſe all the men worthy
[mob]; and the Waggs [Whigs] being ſure of the Gapers [Guards],
Quaint [princeſs Anne], together with the Exchange [Exchequer], and
Tracy [the Tower], were to be ſeized, and thereupon immediately
new partners [parliament] to be called; but Horn [Halifax], Sands
[Somers], and the late Collier [Chancellor], did not approve of this.</p>
                  <p>All this Rogers communicated to Overton [Harley], thinking Ivers
[prince Eugene] would be ſent to pain [priſon]; but finding that Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
[Harley] ſhewed it to Quaint [princeſs Anne] and not to Clevland [cabinet council], he, by Yates [lord Yarmouth], ſent, under hand, a
detail of the whole matter to Beaumont [lord Mulgrave] and the preſent
Collier [lord Keeper], who laid it before Clevland [cabinet council], at
which Overton [Harley] was very much ſurpriſed, and ſtarted; but told
Clevland [the cabinet council], that he had the ſame account, which he
gave to Quaint [princeſs Anne], and another mate [miniſter of ſtate],
ſaying that Quaint [princeſs Anne], finding they were divided among
themſelves, thought it more prudent to ſmother it. To which Clevland
[cabinet council] replied, that it concerned them too near not to ſift it to
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:0950500102:475"/>
the bottom; therefore, ordered that Rogers ſhould be called immediately
before them, to give a full account of the whole matter. Overton
[Harley] ſent immediately for Rogers, and ſpoke to him as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Rogers, you have been betrayed in the ſophiſtry [ſecret] and precepts
[papers] you gave me; to which Rogers replied, that he gave it by Mr.
Noble's [Netterville's] advice to Farringdon [Ferguſon], to lard a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
[paper] that he had then in hand with the heads of it for Quaint's
[princeſs Anne's] uſe; wherewith Overton [Harley] ſeeming to be ſatisfied,
aſked him what courſe was proper to take in the matter. Rogers,
knowing what would be acceptable to him, propoſed to go with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Quaint [princeſs Anne] or any of the mates [miniſters]; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he ordered Rogers to go along with him to Quaint [princeſs
[Anne]. But Beamont [lord Mulgrave], having a hint of this from
Rogers, underhand, ordered him to come before Clevland [cabinet
council], which he accordingly did, and was examined upon all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
[papers] which he (from time to time, during the ſpace of two
years before), gave Overton [Harley]; and having alſo declared the
manner of his obtaining them, Clevland [cabinet council] was ſo much
ſatisfied therewith, that Rogers was deſired to reduce his examination,
which laſted two hours and a half, with all the circumſtances, into writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and at parting returned him thanks, with a promiſe of a ſettlement
during life; and gave poſitive orders that he ſhould be forthwith ſent to
Haſſel's houſe [Holland], to bring back his friend, from whom he had
Ivers's precept [prince Eugene's paper], and to diſcover further the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of Duncan [the Dutch] and the Waggs [Whigs].</p>
                  <p>It is to be obſerved, that Beamont [lord Mulgrave] whiſpered Rogers,
that he ſhould be full and particular in his journal, becauſe it would
turn to his own and friend's [the King's] advantage. Overton [Harley]
gave the following reaſons againſt his going to Haſſel's houſe [Holland].
Firſt, that if it ſhould be found out that a phyſician [Roman Catholic]
ſhould be employed upon ſuch an occaſion, at that juncture, it would
give the Waggs [Whigs] an occaſion to clamour. Secondly, that it
would be enough to divide the Anabaptiſts [allies]; and that Evelin's
houſe [England] would never be truſted hereafter, if they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
theſe ſophiſtries [ſecrets] before the partners [parliament]: and,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:0950500102:476"/>
thirdly, that it would give Knox [King of France] an opportunity to
make what portion [peace] he pleaſed, when he found the Anabaptiſts
[allies] jealous of each other, and divided among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But, notwithſtanding all theſe reaſons, Rogers was ordered to go on
his journey; who, coming to Rymer's houſe [Rotterdam], he met his
confident, and engaged him to come back to Evelin's houſe [England],
where he ſhould be provided for during his life. He liked the offer, but
inſiſted upon having it under the ſharper's [ſecretary of ſtate's] own hand.
This Rogers communicated to Overton [Harley], but had no anſwer.
It is to be obſerved, that, notwithſtanding theſe matters did properly
belong to the ſharper's [ſecretary of ſtate's] province, yet Overton [Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley]
took it into his own management, in order to conceal it from Clev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
[privy council], and communicate it only to Quaint [princeſs
Anne], and keep Rogers out of the way as long as he could, to prevent
his being tampered with by Clevland [cabinet council].</p>
                  <p>Rogers was not long in Haſſel's houſe [Holland], when Ciprian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from Putney [Paris] at Hatton's houſe [the Hague], and gave
three memorandums, one to Harpers [penſionary Heinſius], one to
Hall's agent [Hannover agent], and a third to Egleton's agent [the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
ambaſſador], containing in ſubſtance all what he and his father
tranſacted in Evelin's houſe [England]; and that he had contracted in
Knox's [King of France's] name with Clevland [cabinet council], and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
with Overton [Harley], for a great quantity of maps [money],
in caſe he ſhould agree to give a ſeparate portion [peace]; and that
Quaint [princeſs Anne] deſired him to tell Mr. Jenkins [the King] that
ſhe would ſend for him as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>This was acceptable to the above-mentioned three perſons, who ſaid
it was the only thing they wanted; and that they had enough to undo
Quaint [princeſs Anne] and deſtroy Clevland [the cabinet council], and
prevent the pardon general [the general peace]. Rogers, being apprized
of all this matter, acquainted Overton [Harley] therewith, as he did
likewiſe Doyle, Peyton, and Mead [mariſhal D'Uxelles, Abbé Polig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,
and Mr. Menager], aſſuring them, that now they had a good game
in hand, which, if rightly managed, would turn to Knox's [the King of
France's] advantage, and forward the portion [peace] to their ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They aſked how? Rogers anſwered, that Ciprian was to be ſent

with good recommendations to Mouldſworth [lord Churchill], and to the
chief of the Waggs [Whigs] dignified with titles of honour and good
characters from Hall [Hannover] and Egleton [the Emperor]; and that
he the ſaid Rogers would go with him to Evelin's houſe [England],
and introduce him firſt to Clevland [cabinet council], to let him ſee all
the precepts [papers] he had along with him, which would be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Clevland [cabinet council], who would engage him in Quaint's
[princeſs Anne's] intereſt, in order to expoſe the ſophiſtry [ſecret] of the
Waggs [Whigs] and Duncan [Dutch], and lay the ſame before the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
[parliament], which would infallibly give them a plauſible handle
to deſtroy the ſhape of Hall [ſucceſſion of Hannover].</p>
                  <p>Mead [Monſieur Menager] replied, that it was not prudent to hazard
the breaking the meaſures ſo well concerted, wherein Rogers had a good
ſhare; and the ſaid Mead [Monſieur Menager] well underſtood that
Rogers aimed at the immediate reſtoration of Kennedy [the King] to his
truſt [throne], and ſaid Knox [the King of France] would take care of
that, after finiſhing the pardon general [the general peace]. Rogers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that now was the proper time, and that ſuch a favourable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
would never offer again; and told them, that he would ſend Ciprian
to Stapleton [lord Strafford], who went the day before to Haſſel's houſe
[Holland]; upon this, the three retiring aſide, and conſulting a while
together, they told Rogers, that Tradenham [Monſieur de Torcy] ſent
for Ciprian, in order to give him new inſtructions to take care of his affairs
in Evelin's houſe [England]; and, by that means, he might have a better
opportunity of ſerving both Knox [King of France] and Kennedy's [the
King's] intereſts.</p>
                  <p>They, finding that poor Ciprian did bite at this bait, very wiſely ſent
him away to Putney [Paris], not doubting his ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>But Rogers, having a watchful eye upon him, and diſcovering his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of going directly to the Waggs [Whigs], got him, by a ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem,
to Haſſel's houſe [Holland], and acquainted Stapleton [lord
Strafford] with the whole matter; who approved of Rogers' conduct, in
ſending him to Clevland [cabinet council]; and offered to ſend Moulins
[a meſſenger] along with him; but Ciprian ſhewing Harper [Heinſius]
the orders which Doyle [Mareſchal D'Uxelles] and his companions gave
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:0950500102:480"/>
for going firſt to Tradenham [Monſieur de Torcy] to receive his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he approved of it, and deſired him to go with ſpeed; and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him all the humour [honour] and pinimo [penſion] he could deſire<note n="*" place="bottom">N. B. Ciprian having propoſed Rogers to vouch the truth of his allegation, Harper [Heinſius] conſulted with, the agents of Hall and Egleton about ſecuring Rogers; but he being apprized of it, avoided the ſnare.</note>.
So he accordingly went to Tradenham [Monſieur de Torcy], and how
he was received the reader knows.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, Rogers told Doyles [Mareſchal D'Uxelles] and his fellows,
that a good ſcheme was ſpoiled, if this fellow ſhould be kept in pain
[priſon]; and that it was ſacrificing Kennedy's [the King's] intereſt to
theirs, at preſent. To which Doyles [Mareſchal D'Uxelles] replied, that
Quaint [princeſs Anne] and Knox [King of France] would do his [the
King's] buſineſs in due time; and ſaid, that, for his part, he would be
ſure to acquaint Knox [King of France] how active Rogers has been in
his and Kemp's [the King's] affairs, both there and in Evelin's houſe [Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land];
and that he acted like a man of honour, eſpecially in this particular.</p>
                  <p>Rogers finding that all the parleys [plots] he propoſed, for a preſent
replication [reſtoration], muſt be laid aſide for a time, he thought of
another, which he expected may turn to as good account, which is as
follows.</p>
                  <p>During his abode in Haſſel's houſe [Holland], he luckily met with a
relation of his own, who was converſant with the principal men that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
that houſe [ſtate], and found, by his friend's and his own obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
that Haſſel's houſe [Holland] was governed by Waggs [Whigs]
and Tanners [Tories], as well as Evelin's houſe [England]; and that the
Waggs [Whigs] are the perſons now in vogue; and that the Tanners
[Tories] being in obſcurity during this long reckoning [revolution] were
meditating a long time to bring about a replication [reſtoration] there,
after the ſame manner as in Evelin's houſe [England].</p>
                  <p>Rogers, being introduced by his friend to the chief of theſe Tanners
[Tories] found, by diſcourſing with them, that they wanted only a little
map [money] to compaſs their ends; wherein there was no difficulty, as
in Evelin's houſe [England]. He, upon this, propoſed to Knox's [King
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:0950500102:481"/>
of France's] agents, among them, to ſupply them; and having prevailed
with them to ſend to the ſaid perſons, who came and made out that they
could infallibly do it without noiſe or ſtir, by beſtowing a ſmall matter on
ſuch as ſhould be ſtubborn; with this the agents [ambaſſadors] ſeemed
well pleaſed, and aſſured them, that Knox [King of France] ſhould be
acquainted with their good intention; but Peyton [Abbé Polignac] told
Rogers, that he believed Knox [King of France] would hardly hear of
this propoſal, without firſt conſulting the mates [miniſters] of Evelin's
houſe [England]. Rogers replied, that he would ſend to get Clevland's
[cabinet council] conſent, but he was called away before he could have
an anſwer. He acquainted Clevland [cabinet council] therewith, which
was well approved of; but Overton [Harley] ſaid, that the portion
[peace] was far advanced, and it would be better to defer it till after the
pardon general [general peace], becauſe it would weaken the politician
[proteſtant] intereſt abroad; ſaying, that although Duncan [the Dutch]
ſhould be humbled, yet Knox [the King of France] ſhould not be
exalted.</p>
                  <p>Rogers, ſeeing that Knox [the King of France], in conjunction with
Overton [Harley], was intent upon ſecuring their own game, did reſolve
to ply Overton [Harley] warmly, by ſetting Clevland [cabinet council]
upon his back; which he did, by communicating to Beaumont [lord
Mulgrave], by Yates [lord Yarmouth], what he wrote to Overton [Harley],
from time to time, during his abode at Haſſel's houſe [Holland], viz.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that Moulſworth [lord Churchill] wrote to Harper [Henſius] and
Evers [prince Eugene] not to let the foreign allen [army] in Quaint's
[princeſs] Anne's ſervice obey Overbury [duke of Ormond], thinking
thereby to prevent Knox [King of France] giving up Dean's houſe [Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk]
to Quaint; and this would give the Waggs [Whigs] a plauſible
handle to ſend Overton [Harley] and one or two more to Tracy [the
Tower] and conſequently would be a good excuſe for Knox [King of
France] to abandon Quaint.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he diſcovered at Hatton's houſe [the Hague] the new plan
framed by Moulſworth [lord Churchill], Horn [Halifax], and Sands
[Somers], for bringing Hall [Hannover] to Evelin's houſe [England],
by publiſhing a model [a manifeſto], containing that Kennedy [the King]
was coming from Fitches' houſe [France] with a phyſician allen [a
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:0950500102:482"/>
Roman Catholic army], and arrived at Sutler's houſe [Scotland]; and that
Hall [Hannover] was arrived at Evelin's houſe [England], to ſecure the
copyhold [crown] againſt Kemp [the King], and that Moulſworth [lord
Churchill] was to have a good allen [army] of his own. By this means,
they did not doubt but the unthinking menworthy [mob] would join
them, and that Quaint [princeſs Anne], upon this occaſion, would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
eſcape, as Mr. Kemp [the late King] did at the late reckoning [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution].</p>
                  <p>This plauſible project was ſent to Mrs. Strange [princeſs Sophia], not
doubting of her approbation, and give her conſent to young Hall [Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover]
going to Evelin's houſe [England].</p>
                  <p>But the more penetrating heads among the Waggs [Whigs] adviſed
her, underhand, to be wary in ſo important an affair, and avoid all things
that would give the Tanners [Tories] a good pretence to alter the ſhape
[ſucceſſion].</p>
                  <p>Hall [Hannover] ſent his agent to know the ſtrength of the Waggs
[Whigs], and in caſe he found their intereſt to be as they repreſented it,
he was to be governed by them, and accordingly the agent keeps very
cloſe to them, who are fully reſolved to pave the way for Hall [Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover]
this ſummer of partners [ſeſſion of parliament].</p>
                  <p>By this they propoſe to gain two points; firſt, in caſe the Tanners
[Tories] oppoſe it, then it's clear they are for Kennedy [the King], which
will give umbrage to the menworthy [mob], and draw them away from
the Tanners [Tories]. Secondly, They expect to have a majority among
the next partners [parliament].</p>
                  <p>Rogers wrote to Overton [Harley], that the perſon from whom he had
all theſe ſophiſtries [ſecrets] ſhould be ſent to Evelin's houſe [England]
to prove it <hi>viva voce;</hi> but had no anſwer while he was at Haſſel's houſe
[Holland], which may fall heavy on him hereafter.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1713</label> TO throw light on the Hannover papers of the preſent year, it is
neceſſary to premiſe a few particulars. The baron de Bernſdorff
was preſident of the Elector's council, and M. de Robethon ſecretary for
embaſſies<note n="*" place="bottom">Secretaire des ambaſſades.</note>. Baron de Grote was his Electoral Highneſs's envoy at the
court of London in the beginning of the preſent year. Grote died in
the month of April, and was ſucceeded by M. de Schutz, whoſe father
had been in England ſome years before in the ſame character. Kreyenberg
was ordinary reſident, and Galke ſecretary to the embaſſy. It does not
appear that Monſieur l'Hermitage acted in any public character from the
court of Hannover: he was probably connected with the Dutch embaſſy;
at leaſt, his buſineſs obliged him to go ſometimes to Holland. The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from London, ſaid to have been ſent by a <hi>ſecret addreſs,</hi> were uſually
directed to Mr. Siffen at the Hague.</p>
               <p>The baron de Bothmar was the Elector's envoy extraordinary at the
Hague, and his miniſter plenipotentiary at the treaty of Utrecht. Klin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graff
was reſident, and Schrader ſecretary to the embaſſy. The originals
of all Bothmar's letters to Robethon are extant, and likewiſe the originals
of moſt of the letters written to him by Schutz, Kreyenberg, and Galke;
but of ſome of them we have only copies in Robethon's hand, which he
decyphered for the uſe of the Elector and his miniſters. They frequently
refer him for further particulars to their letters to Bothmar. Bothmar
ſent him copies of theſe letters, decyphered in Schrader's hand, and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
marked in his own hand at the top, the date of the letter and the
name of the writer. As theſe copies are extant, we have probably all
the letters written by the Hannoverian agents from this country, from
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:0950500102:484"/>
the beginning of April this year to the acceſſion of George I. in Auguſt,
1714.</p>
               <p>They, indeed, wrote regularly, by every poſt, to the Elector himſelf,
what they called a narrative<note n="*" place="bottom">Une relation.</note>; but in their letters to Bothmar, Bernſdorff,
and Robethon, they generally repeat in a ſummary manner what they
wrote at greater length to their maſter. As either the originals or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic
copies of all their letters are extant, we are probably acquainted
with the whole ſubject of their correſpondence, during a period, in which
the proteſtant ſucceſſion was thought to be in the utmoſt danger, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
were actually formed for bringing in the Pretender.</p>
               <p>They ſent by every poſt a very particular account of parliamentary
proceedings: but it differs in nothing from what is publickly known;
and therefore has been entirely omitted. But every thing that they wrote,
of the private characters and conduct of the great men, who flouriſhed at
this period, has been carefully extracted; and we know, at leaſt, what
the Hannoverians thought of them, and in what light they were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by others.</p>
               <p>De Grote was ſent to Great Britain to obtain a penſion for the princeſs
Sophia, and the arrears claimed by the Elector, as due to his troops which
ſerved in Flanders, and to inſiſt upon the Pretender's removal from Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain.
The court of Hannover, ignorant of that prince's attachment to
the principles imbibed in his youth, were alarmed this year with rumours
of his converſion; and directions were ſent to Grote to propoſe ſome
meaſures which they thought neceſſary to be taken in ſuch an event.</p>
               <p>The earl of Oxford made a motion in parliament, in the following
year, which, at the time, greatly ſurpriſed the nation: but now the true
cauſe of that meaſure ſufficiently appears. The Whigs had invited the
Elector of Hannover to invade Great Britain, with an army. They, at
the ſame time, endeavoured to ſhow, that Oxford meant only to amuſe
the people, by an affected zeal for the proteſtant ſucceſſion, to conceal his
real deſigns in favour of the Pretender. The motion bore, that, for the
further ſecurity of the ſucceſſion, it ſhould be made high treaſon to bring
foreign troops into the kingdom. A law againſt bringing troops into
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:0950500102:485"/>
Great Britain, to ſupport the cauſe of the Pretender, was unneceſſary;
ſince ſuch troops, if foreigners, might be treated as enemies; and as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
might be puniſhed as rebels. Therefore, the deſign of the earl of
Oxford was to allude, in his motion, to the ſcheme of the Whigs to
bring over the Elector in a hoſtile manner.</p>
               <p>The Queen, in her ſpeech to the parliament, which met on the ninth
of April in the preſent year, expreſſed great zeal for the ſucceſſion in the
houſe of Hannover. But the friends of that family conſidered the ſpeech
itſelf, and the conſequent addreſs of the two houſes, as an artful deſign of
the miniſter to deceive the nation. The agents of Hannover, convinced of
this circumſtance by the Whigs, repreſented to their court, the neceſſity of
taking ſome ſtep to bring the ſincerity of theſe profeſſions to ſuch a proof
as would convince the world, that neither friendſhip nor harmony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
between the Queen and her miniſters and the parliamentary heirs of
the crown.</p>
               <p>The following letters were written by M. de Robethon, at Hannover,
to the Baron de Grote, in London, in January and February. They are
in Robethon's hand, in French; but decyphered by an unknown hand.</p>

propoſe, in both houſes, to bring in a bill exclu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the Pretender, and

The reaſons for ſuch an act are ſo ſtrong, on account of the rumours
which circulate about the prince of Wales in this reſpect, and of the
alarms which theſe rumours give the nation, that I do not ſee they can
venture to make great oppoſition to ſuch a ſalutary ſcheme. If the act
paſſes, we gain every material point for our ſucceſſion; if the Queen's
miniſters oppoſe it, that will unmaſque them, and contribute, more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
than any tiling elſe, to open the eyes of the nation. Pleaſe write to
me what our friends ſay on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>I am likewiſe to tell your Excellency, that remarks on the project of a
Barrier Treaty, propoſed to the Dutch by lord Strafford, are ſent this
evening to the Baron de Bothmar. We have made ſeven or eight cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
ſhort indeed, but eſſential to our ſucceſſion; and lent an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Monſieur de Bothmar, to perſuade the grand penſionary to try to
prevail with the Queen's miniſters to admit theſe corrections. Your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
will receive a copy of them by the next poſt; not in order to
ſpeak of them to the Queen's miniſters, for you know that the treaty was
not communicated to us by them, but in order to make uſe of them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
when the opportunity offers, which can ſcarcely miſs: and, in the
mean time, you are deſired to communicate theſe corrections to lord
Halifax and other friends, and to write to us their opinion of them.
I am, &amp;c."</p>

                     <p>"LORD Oxford had mentioned the treaty of guarantee of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to Kreyenberg, and conſequently would probably mention
it to Grote. Robethon deſires Grote to propoſe to his lordſhip, in the
politeſt manner he could, to inſert the corrections and additions which he
had mentioned in his preceding letter, and of which he now ſends him a
copy. He complains of it, as an omiſſion very offenſive to them, that
there was no mention of the Pretender in the treaty; and deſires to
have the perſon known under the name of the Chevalier de St. George
particularly ſpecified; "if it is in earneſt they have abjured the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier;
if it is in earneſt they demand from France to remove him, and not
to aſſiſt him; they cannot refuſe to mention him in the treaty of guarantee
of our ſucceſſion. It is to be hoped the lord treaſurer will repair the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:0950500102:487"/>
omiſſion of ſuch an eſſential clauſe, and pay attention to the juſt remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances
of your Excellency on the ſubject."</p>
                     <p>Your Excellency may be aſſured, that in the act which eſtabliſhes the
ſucceſſion, and in all the acts which have been made ſince concerning it,
even at the time when the Whigs had all the power in their hands, there
never was a clauſe inſerted for excluding the Pretender in caſe he turned
Proteſtant; which, however, would be very neceſſary. It will be ſaid,
perhaps, that the popiſh lords likewiſe, who might be converted, would
be excluded thereby from the houſe of peers. But there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the ſovereign and an individual. The Pretender, on the
ſlighteſt appearance of a pretended converſion, might ruin all, the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
the liberties, the privileges of the nation, &amp;c. This is not the caſe
of a lord, and therefore it is not parallel. Beſides, when they exclude
the Pretender, in ſuch a caſe they may, if they chuſe, make an exception
in favour of the lords who would change. Your Excellency will ſpeak
of all this to perſons more capable of judging of it, than I am."</p>

pains which he takes to avoid you. You cannot be too diffident of him,
and you muſt take care that we are not duped by him. We may depend
upon it, that Oxford is too far engaged with France and the Queen, to
dare to be able to withdraw; and even though he inclined it, it would be
impoſſible for him to bring back the Queen to proper meaſures; ſo that
all he would gain, would be to meet with the ſame fate with Godolphin

                     <p>On this account, and with this precaution, the attentions which you
propoſe to ſhow to that miniſter, and the manner in which you intend to
behave to the Queen's miniſters in general, are greatly approved of here;

                     <p>With regard to the penſion, we think here, that Sunderland and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
reaſon much better on the ſubject than Halifax; for, upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
which is but too probable, of the lord treaſurer's intentions, the
great aim ſhould be to unmaſk him and the other miniſters publickly,
and to open the eyes of the nation, which cannot be done but by the
means of ſome ſuch buſineſs as this, brought before the parliament:
whereas, whatever the Queen's miniſters may be entreated to obtain from
France about the removal of the Pretender, or to add to the Barrier
Treaty, will not ſtrike the people, and will be liable to chicane; and
conſequently now, when the nation is alarmed on all ſides with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender,
is the proper time to bring an affair of this kind before the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                     <p>I refer myſelf, on this ſubject, to the reſcript which you will receive,
ſigned by our maſter, and add only that Bernſdorf, in particular, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
to you ſtrongly, what regards Argyle and his brother, and to ſee
if, by the hopes you ſhall give them both of a penſion, in caſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
by their intereſt, ſhall grant a penſion to the Electreſs, you can
obtain ſome important ſervice from them. This in reality is a capital

If Oxford continues to avoid you, as I imagine he will, and if Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke

                     <p>You will ſee, by the reſcript of our maſter, that lord Halifax's advice
concerning the Barrier Treaty, and the ſending the Pretender into Italy,

my partiality for the Whigs, and I chooſe rather to wait, until your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
having obſerved the matter yourſelf, ſhould bear teſtimony to
this inconteſtible truth.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the project of going over with a body of troops now to
England, Monſieur de Bernſdorff would have wiſhed, that all that paſſage
had been written in cyphers rather than any other; and his Excellency

                        </gap> me to tell you, that as that deſign requires abſolutely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the States General, and their men of war, it is impoſſible to
think of it at preſent; ſince the States General give their whole atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
now to haſten the peace, and to gain the good graces of the Queen
and of her miniſtry, imagining they have done enough for us, when they
ſigned the treaty guaranteeing the ſucceſſion. We muſt, therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. de Bernſdorff, give time to the States General and to the
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:0950500102:494"/>
Engliſh nation, to be ſenſible of the pernicious conſequences of the peace,
and then we may take juſter meaſures.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion is, if the King of France will not, in the mean time, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
the Pretender by force; but how can we do otherwiſe? If the
Queen dies before the Pretender arrives, all things will be eaſier, and the
States will be obliged, by their guarantee, to aſſiſt us. But it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Monſieur de Bernſtorff, that if it was neceſſary during the Queen's
life time, to take ſuch meaſures againſt her Majeſty and her miniſters, we
would meet with terrible difficulties from the party in the nation who
love the Queen; beſides, it is almoſt certain, the Elector, in that caſe,
will never bring himſelf to ſuch a reſolution. This your Excellency will
very eaſily conceive; but we have every reaſon to hope, that, in caſe of
the Queen's death, the Elector will do whatever can be expected from
him, of which your Excellency may, if you pleaſe, give aſſurances to
our friends.</p>

long then as the Queen lives and the Pretender is out of England, and

of lord Sunderland, lord Somers, lord Halifax, and lord Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
to what follows.</p>
                  <p>What are the ſteps in general which we ſhould take here, after we have

                  <p>What procurations, patents, or orders, ſhould we have ready to be ſent
then, wherever it will be neceſſary?</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bernſtorff is of opinion, that, in caſe of the Queen's death, as the
Electreſs cannot ſet out immediately, nor travel with the neceſſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
the Elector, or, on his refuſal, the Electoral Prince, ſhould ſet out
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:0950500102:497"/>
for London, without the loſs of a moment; and that, on the firſt news
of the Queen's death, ſhips ſhould be kept in readineſs in Holland, for
the ſecurity of his paſſage.</p>
                  <p>We aſk, in that caſe,</p>
                  <p>1. What kind of procuration ſhould the Elector or the Electoral
Prince have from the Electreſs? How far ſhould it extend? Should it
authorize him to diſolve the parliament and to call another; to diſpoſe
of all places; to impriſon ſuſpected perſons, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. We aſk, If the Electreſs, after the Queen's death, can eſtabliſh,
until ſhe arrives in London, a different regency from that which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in the inſtruments now in England, or at leaſt, add to it or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench

                  <p>3. In caſe the Queen dies before your Excellency has changed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
can you ſtill eſtabliſh as regents the lords named in the laſt
inſtruments, and make them valid?</p>
                  <p>4. Can the Electreſs, after the Queen's death, authoriſe the Elector to
diſmiſs this regency, and take the government into his own hands, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
his privy council of ſuch perſons as he ſhall think deſerving?</p>
                  <p>5. If it is neceſſary, that the regency ſhould ſubſiſt until the Electreſs
arrives; we aſk what ſhare of the government can the Elector or the
Electoral Prince have, jointly with the regents?</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time that the Electreſs ſets out for London, Monſieur de
Bernſtorff would have the Electoral Prince or duke Erneſt to repair to
Ghent, Bruges and Dunkirk; in order to ſecure thoſe three towns, place
good governours in them, and adminiſter oaths to the Engliſh troops
which garriſon them.</p>
                  <p>6. We aſk, how ſhould the order be drawn out which the Electreſs
will give to the prince whom we ſhall charge with this commiſſion?</p>
                  <p>M. de Bernſtorff wants that Mr. Cadogan ſhould be at hand to go
over to England upon the firſt notice of the Queen's death, furniſhed
with the neceſſary orders from the Electreſs, for taking the oaths of the
troops in England, breaking the ſuſpected officers, filling up their places,
ſecuring the tower of London, &amp;c. We would chooſe to have theſe
orders for Mr. Cadogan, with patents of the offices which will be given
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:0950500102:498"/>
to him, ready in the hands of the baron de Bothmar, in Holland. Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar

the duke of Marlborough.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall endeavour to know from the duke of Marlborough, by the
means of Cadogan, what part he would chooſe to act, in caſe of the
Queen's death. If he would go directly to London, being one of the
regents, or go along with the Elector. Robethon hath already written,
that it is deſired here, that he ſhould ſtay within reach; and that, inſtead
of going to live at Francfort, he ſhould ſettle at Wezel.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we aſk ſimilar explanations concerning the internal affairs of
the kingdom, with regard to the great offices which muſt be diſpoſed of,
in order that we might have the patents ready, and with regard to every
thing elſe which our friends will judge neceſſary. We muſt have ſome
form of the patents for great offices.</p>
                  <p>We aſk, if the Queen being dead, the Electreſs ſhould write to the

                  <p>A copy of the preceding Queries was ſent to Bothmar,<note place="margin">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Bothmar 10. No. 14.</note> at the Hague,
to be communicated to Mr. Cadogan, who was to come to Holland on
a commiſſion from the duke of Marlborough; and Bothmar, in a letter to
Robethon,<note place="margin">Ibid. No. 138.</note> on the 18th and in a poſtſcript to it on the 25th of March,
gives him Cadogan's and Marlborough's anſwer to theſe queries.</p>
                  <p>It was the duke's opinion, that the Elector ſhould go to England im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
upon the Queen's death, with full powers from the Electreſs,
as her lieutenant general. The Kings of England, he ſaid, frequently
inveſted lieutenants to govern the kingdom, in their abſence, with all the
authority and power they poſſeſſed themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Cadogan thought, that the Electoral Prince ſhould not go to take the
command of the Engliſh troops on the continent; but that Bothmar
ſhould proviſionally have powers in his hands to authorize the duke of
Marlborough and himſelf (Cadogan), to ſecure theſe troops and the
fortreſſes they garriſon. If the Electreſs did not chooſe to ſign a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of that kind, it would be ſufficient to have one ſigned by the
Elector, in her name. The troops, upon ſeeing a parchment with the
great ſeal of his Electoral Highneſs would readily obey a man ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them as the duke of Marlborough. It was not neceſſary to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:0950500102:499"/>
the form uſed in commiſſions of that kind in England, nor to write
one in Engliſh, The duke of Marlborough's commiſſion and his own
were in England, and he could not ſend copies of them; but it would be
ſufficient to ſay in the new patent, that he was now inveſted with the
ſame powers he had formerly from the Queen.</p>
                  <p>When the duke of Marlborough was ſure of the fidelity of the troops
abroad, he might follow the Elector into England, and leave the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral
Prince with Cadogan to command the troops.</p>
                  <p>Cadagon thought it was very neceſſary, that he himſelf ſhould have the
commiſſion of lieutenant general and governour of the tower, under the
duke of Marlborough or the Electoral Prince. Bothmar, however, was
not thoroughly convinced of that neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Cadogan gave Bothmar the character of ſome officers. Colonel Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomondely,
who commanded the ſecond battalion of Guards, which went
back to England, was attached to the Proteſtant ſucceſſion, and the two
battalions, officers, and men, might be depended upon. Major general
Sabin who commanded at Ghent, a timid man, but well affected at the
bottom, and might be managed. Brigadier Sutton, who commanded at
Bruges, was entirely dependent on the miniſtry; but to make amends,
colonel Hill, who commanded the regiment of royal Scots, might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on. The commandant at Dunkirk, a Scotchman, and two bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
of that nation, were thorough Jacobites; but the eight Engliſh
battalions were well affected, and would give a very good account of the
other two, and of their commandant.</p>
                  <p>Cadogan concluded, with recommending, from the duke of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,
that his Electoral Highneſs ſhould have ſome one with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender,
to ſend exact and ſpeedy intelligence of every thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.
The duke offered to find a proper perſon, if the Elector would
lay out fifty louis-d'ors a month, and in the mean time, he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to have ſome news of what was done openly at the Pretender's
court.</p>
                  <p>Bothmar writes, in his poſtſcript, that Cadogan approved of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
ſent to Marlborough and to himſelf: he gives it as his opinion,
that Cadogan ſhould be employed to command the troops abroad, that
there might be an opportunity of doing ſomething at home for Mr.
Stanhope, who was well affected, and a man of abilities.</p>

                  <p>"THE duke of Lorrain, upon frequent ſolicitations from the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and an order from the court of France, has been obliged to
write to his Imperial Majeſty for two paſſports for the Pretender, one
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:0950500102:502"/>
for going to the waters of Aix la Chapelle, in the month of Auguſt next,
and the other for going to reſide afterwards at Liege or Cologn. The
Pretender has aſked theſe paſſports, and is to go to Liege or Cologn, by the
advice of his friends, and of the very miniſtry in England. In caſe the
Emperor refuſes theſe paſſports, the Pretender will go to reſide at the
Abbacy of St. Miel, on the banks of the Maeſe, and frontiers of Lorrain.
He has very weak lungs, and will not return to Bar where the air is
too ſharp for him. He is now at Commercy, and has in his ſuite, the
earl of Middleton, lord Edward, the ſon of the duke of Perth, Mr. Strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Mr. Mac Donald, Mr. Floyd."</p>
                  <p>"They are ſo very ſilent about every thing done in England, that a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
about the Pretender, having ſaid to one of the court of Lorrain,
that their affairs went very well in London, and this diſcourſe having
been reported to lord Middleton, was diſmiſſed and ſent back to Paris."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Seldon, formerly governour to the Pretender, having quarrelled
with lord Middleton, is likewiſe ſent back to Paris. Five perſons lately
come from England, had ſecret conferences with the Pretender and my
lord Middleton. They concealed their names and the object of their
journey ſo carefully, that it was impoſſible to diſcover either the one or
the other. It was remarked, however, that they were received with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction,

was drawn up by lord chief juſtice Parker, with the advice of lord

was drawn up by theſe three perſons, with great care. There
are, beſides, two other commiſſions; one in Latin, for a lord lieutenant
of Ireland, and the other in Engliſh, for a captain general, ſuch as the
Duke of Marlborough has been. I ſhall ſend you likewiſe, in a few

neceſſary. It is to ſend over the Electoral Prince. It is true, an

the greateſt injury which their greateſt enemies could wiſh them. If the
Elector will conſent to this point, it will give ſuch ſupport to the friends
of the ſucceſſion, that the other affair of the money will not be neceſſary.
This is the unanimous opinion of all friends, and they have charged me

1. The inſtrument for nominating lords juſtices ought to be ſealed up,
and depoſited with the archbiſhop, &amp;c. during her Majeſty's life, or their
validity will be too doubtful to be depended upon: for the inſtruments
already ſealed up and depoſited are effectual appointments of lords juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
until revoked or altered; and when there is an intention to revoke
or alter them, the Act, page 227, appoints a particular method how
that is to be effected, by three writings, under hand and ſeal, requiring
them to be delivered up; and till that be done, by the expreſs words of
the Act, page 228, the inſtruments, ſealed up and depoſited as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
are thoſe which are directed to be brought before the privy council,
there to be opened and read, and afterwards to be inrolled in Chancery.
And, therefore, as often as it ſhall be thought fit to make any alteration
in the three inſtruments, it ought to be kept in mind, that the alteration
is incompleat, and that nothing is in effect done till the old inſtruments
are taken up, and the new ſealed up, and depoſited in their place; and
that during the Queen's life, in Robethon's hand.</p>
                  <p>2. In caſe of the demiſe of her Majeſty, the regency eſtabliſhed by the
act of parliament may be entirely aboliſhed, by the ſucceſſor, before her
or his arrival in Great Britain. The Kings and Queens of England have,
by the common law, a power to conſtitute a regency in their abſence, in
ſuch manner as is afore-mentioned; and this regency, eſtabliſhed by this
act, was not intended as any diminution of the royal power, but is merely
proviſional, to prevent an inter-regnum before the ſucceſſor could arrive
in perſon, or conſtitute a regency; and, when either of thoſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
the end deſigned by it is fully attained: accordingly by the expreſs
words of the Act, in the clauſe page 226, which makes the ſeven officers
lords juſtices, they are appointed lords juſtices, and impowered to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
all acts of government, (no longer than) until ſuch ſucceſſor ſhall
arrive, or otherwiſe determine their authority. And by the next clauſe,
the perſons nominated in the three inſtruments are only to be added to
the ſeven, and to act with them as lords juſtices as fully, and in the ſame
manner, as if they had been particularly named in the Act; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
their authority will be liable to be determined in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as the authority of the ſeven who are particularly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>But whether ſome of the regents may be removed from the regency,
after they have once entered upon it, without aboliſhing the whole, is
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:0950500102:506"/>
doubtful. The ſucceſſor's arrival of courſe determines the authority of
them all; and whether the power of determining their authority other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
(as the words of the act run), mean not a like determination of the
authority of them all, is not clear enough to be depended upon in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this conſequence. It is yet more doubtful, whether thoſe who are
lords juſtices by virtue of the act, either the ſeven officers, or thoſe
named in the three inſtruments, can act together, with any others to be
added anew to them by the ſucceſſor, after they ſhall have entered upon
their office.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, in caſe it ſhould be thought requiſite to remove any of the
old, or to add any new, the ſafeſt way will be, to determine the whole
regency, and conſtitute one or more perſon or perſons lord juſtice or lords
juſtices, with or without reſtraints, and with ſuch directions as ſhall be
thought fit.</p>
                  <p>3. The ſucceſſor's power to determine the authority of the lords juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
appointed by the act, before her arrival in Great Britain, ſuppoſes
the power to appoint <hi>a new one or new ones by the common law.</hi> And in
caſe of the demiſe of her Majeſty during the life of the Electreſs, it is
agreeable to law, and ſeems in itſelf proper and requiſite, that ſhe ſhould
appoint the Elector, her ſon, or the Electoral Prince, her grandſon, Lord
Juſtice of Great Britain, <hi>Cuſtos Regni et Locum tenens,</hi> with power and
directions, in caſe he ſhall ſee it fit and convenient, to diſſolve and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the privy council, and appoint a new one; to diſſolve the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and call a new one; to remove all officers, and diſpoſe of all offices
and employments in the diſpoſal of the crown (which will extend to thoſe
of the ſeven regents not for life); and to execute and do all other acts of
government in the name and ſtead of the new ſucceeding Queen, as if ſhe
were preſent in perſon. That ſhe may do this, before her arrival in
Great Britain, is plain, becauſe it is a proper regal act, often done by
the Kings of England; and the clauſe, page 231, which gives force and
effect to ſuch ſeal as the ſucceeding Queen or King ſhall make uſe of, to
affix to any inſtrument to execute and do any regal act, proves that ſuch
ſucceeding Queen or King may do regal acts before her or his arrival in
Great Britain. That the privy council may be determined, appears page
225, where it is continued ſix months, unleſs ſooner determined by the
next ſucceſſor.

That all officers, not for life, may be removed, and others put in
their places, appears by the ſame clauſe; and it is to be noted, that in
that clauſe concerning the continuance of officers of the privy council,
all the officers appointed regents, except the archbiſhop, and the chief
juſtice, are expreſly named. Therefore, it is to be obſerved, they may
be removed from their offices, though it be doubtful whether they can
be removed from the regency, while it continues; and it ſeems plain,
that the removal of them from their offices, does not of itſelf remove
them from the regency, nor will their ſucceſſors become lords juſtices,
in virtue of their ſucceeding to thoſe offices, for the regency is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to their offices to go along therewith; but, page 226, the ſeven
officers after-named, who ſhall be in poſſeſſion of their offices at the time
of ſuch demiſe of her Majeſty, are appointed lords juſtices until the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
ſhall arrive, or otherwiſe determine their authority, where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that thoſe who ſhall ſucceed to thoſe offices are not within the
words, to be lords juſtices, becauſe not in poſſeſſion of thoſe offices at
the time of the demiſe of her Majeſty; and thoſe who were in poſſeſſion
at the time of ſuch demiſe are continued until the ſucceſſor arrive, or
otherwiſe determine (not their offices, but) their authority; <hi>i. e.</hi> their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of lords juſtices.</p>
                  <p>That the parliament may be diſſolved, is certain; and may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from page 228, where the regents, conſtituted lords juſtices by
the act, are reſtrained from diſſolving the parliament, without expreſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from ſuch ſucceeding Queen or King: therefore, by ſuch direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thoſe lords juſtices may diſſolve it; and much more, therefore, may
another lord juſtice, appointed by the ſucceeding Queen or King, not
under the reſtraints laid by the act, upon the proviſional regency.</p>
                  <p>4. The prince ſo appointed lord juſtice, <hi>Cuſtos regni et locum tenens,</hi>
may, by virtue thereof, take upon him the whole government; and upon
his ſo doing, and producing his patent, the regency appointed by the act
will be determined. However, it may be proper to have an expreſs
clauſe for determining the regency inſerted in the patent, to prevent all
doubts in that caſe, and nothing more is requiſite to the aboliſhing the
regency.</p>
                  <p>5. The acts done by ſuch lord juſtice, purſuant to his authority, will,
in law, be the acts of the ſovereign, however the privy council, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:0950500102:510"/>
and officers being appointed, to continue for ſome time, unleſs
ſooner determined, diſſolved, or removed, by the next ſucceſſor. To
leave no room for doubt, it may be proper to inſert expreſs powers and
directions, for the lord juſtice to diſſolve and determine the privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
to diſſolve the parliament, and to remove officers if he ſhall ſee fit.</p>
                  <p>6. The removing of any officers in the diſpoſition of the crown, and
appointing new ones, is a regal act, which may be done abroad, taking
care to declare of what effect the ſeal whereby the inſtrument is ſealed
ſhall be. And as to offices to be executed in Great Britain, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
granting the office, or directing the regents to grant the office, may
be ſent over before the next ſucceſſor or the <hi>Cuſtos regni</hi> can arrive; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
a captain general may be abroad appointed to command the
forces abroad, and to ſecure their fidelity, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The regency will have power ſufficient as to the forces in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
but yet the ſucceſſor may appoint a captain general for them too,
if it ſhall be thought requiſite.</p>
                  <p>7. A particular power to ſeize and impriſon ſuſpected perſons, will be
neither neceſſary nor uſeful, the ordinary magiſtrates have ſufficient
powers for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>8. It is to be obſerved, once for all, that any dormant inſtrument for
any of the purpoſes aforeſaid, ſealed during her Majeſty's life, will be of
no force by the laws of Great Britain."</p>

wrote in cyphers, and ſent their letters to Hannover by a private convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
Robethon decyphered them for the uſe of the Elector, and his

to abridge them and to narrate their contents, as they all relate to the

only ſecurity of the ſucceſſion, and the moſt proper means of proving the
inſincerity of the Queen and her miniſtry in their profeſſions of friendſhip

                     <p>"THE friends of the family of Hannover in both houſes of parliamen
affirm, that the treaſurer could not have given a more fatal blow to
their influence in the nation, and to the ſecurity of the proteſtant ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

than by making the Queen declare, that a perfect friendſhip ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
between the two courts. Halifax, Townſhend, Sunderland, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
Orford, Cowper, and the lord juſtice Parker, conſulted together
for two days; but could not contrive any probable means of preventing
the conſequences of the treaſurer's deſigns. The two firſt lords came
twice to Kreyenberg, in the name of the reſt, to repreſent, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
the Elector ſhould take ſome ſtep that would undeceive the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Kreyenberg propoſed, that they themſelves ſhould make ſome
motion in parliament, which they knew the miniſtry would reject. This
would diſcover the inſincerity of their proteſtations. They anſwered,
that the miniſtry would then repreſent them as ſeditious in the eyes of
the nation, who believed implicitly the Queen's declaration, and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
to create a miſunderſtanding between the two courts; and they
gave it as their opinion, that the Electoral Prince ſhould take advantage
of the Queen's declaration, and come over to England, which would
greatly embarraſs the miniſtry."</p>

                     <p>"THE Queen's ſpeech, which you have already received, is very art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
compoſed to blind the eyes of the people; eſpecially the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
which inſinuates, that there ſubſiſts a perfect underſtanding between
her Majeſty and their Electoral Highneſſes, as if the Queen did nothing
without conſulting the Elector; when, at the ſame time, ſhe has not even
a miniſter at Hannover.</p>
                     <p>Eight of your principal friends, who dined together on Thurſday, at
my lord Halifax's, have given me in charge to tell you, that there will be
no reſource, unleſs the Electoral Prince is ſent over ſoon. All theſe fine
compliments to the Electoral family, which are contained in the Queen's
ſpeech, and in the addreſs of the two houſes, ſhould encourage your
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:0950500102:513"/>
court to approve of this journey, and they furniſh the moſt natural pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
in the world; which is, to come in perſon, to acknowledge thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſuch obliging declarations, and pretend to conſider them as very
ſincere: for it is but juſt to pay the diſſimulation of the Queen and of
the treaſurer in the ſame coin. And his Electoral Highneſs cannot but
be ſenſible of the unbecoming manner in which they treat him, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
from the throne, that they do nothing but in concert with him;
while they neglect to give the leaſt anſwer to the two memorials, preſented
by the deceaſed M. de Grote, concerning the removal of the Pretender
and the penſion of the Electreſs; and while they ſacrifice entirely, at
Utrecht, the intereſts of his electorate, and of his office as high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
of the empire.</p>
                     <p>At any rate, here is the fineſt opportunity in the world, to catch lord
Oxford in his own ſnare. It would ſeem that Providence preſents it to
you. For God's ſake, do not neglect it; for when you would chooſe to
recur to it hereafter, it may be too late.</p>
                     <p>The prince does not require an order to come here, either the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the parliament, which is not to be expected from a parliament ſo
ill compoſed as the preſent, or the permiſſion of the Queen, which moſt
aſſuredly ſhe will not grant, if it is aſked. He is entirely at liberty to
come of his own accord, being naturalized, and being duke of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
and a member in the houſe of peers, and his rank as prince of the
blood being ſettled. The Queen herſelf cannot forbid him according
to the laws, neither to come into the kingdoms, nor to take his ſeat in
parliament; and her Majeſty and her miniſters, after ſuch public and
ſolemn declarations, which the Queen and the two houſes have lately
made, cannot retract themſelves, and will be obliged to receive the prince
well, while every one will turn to him, as to the riſing ſun, ſeeing the
Queen's health is ſo broken.</p>
                     <p>My lord Halifax told me, that the friends would by no means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in parliament, that it would be neceſſary to have ſome one of the
Electoral family in this country; for that would be queſtioning a right,
which your princes have obtained, and give a handle to parliament to
take, in that reſpect, ſome improper reſolution, which might render the
coming of the prince more difficult; neither will they ſpeak of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:0950500102:514"/>
for the Electreſs; but I believe they will bring the removal of the
Pretender upon the carpet.</p>
                     <p>The friends are very deſirous, that the Elector ſhould immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to ſend over the prince, in order that he may arrive during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſeſſion of parliament, which will not continue but two months, and
may take his ſeat in the houſe of peers, not in order to vote with the
Whigs, and againſt the court, but in order to take poſſeſſion of what is
due to him; and to convince the nation of the falſehood of the rumours
they circulated, that the Elector is indifferent about the crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
For, in other reſpects, our friends agree, that the Prince ſhould
make his court to the Queen, pay attention to the miniſters, careſs every
one without diſtinction of party, and refrain from coming to the houſe
when party queſtions are debated, ſince he would be obliged, if he came
on ſuch occaſions, to vote either againſt the court, or againſt the friends
of the ſucceſſion.</p>
                     <p>That the nation is for the Electoral family, and againſt the Pretender,
is evident now to a demonſtration, ſince the court imagines they cannot
carry the enſuing elections, but by means of her Majeſty's declarations
in favour of the family; and the members of the houſe of commons,
that they may be choſen again for the next parliament, cover themſelves,
in their addreſſes, with the ſame maſk of a pretended zeal for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
ſucceſſion: an example, which will be followed, in all the
addreſſes that will be preſented, on the peace, from all parts of the
kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The lord treaſurer publiſhes every where in the counties, that his
Electoral Highneſs is in perfect concert with the Queen, and will be very
well pleaſed, that the members recommended by the court ſhould be
choſen. This artifice ſucceeds to the treaſurer's ſatisfaction in many
places; and as he has, beſides, money to lay out, and is very liberal of
it on ſuch occaſions; the Whigs are diſcouraged thereby from offering
themſelves to be choſen, from the fear of being diſappointed. So that
there is a danger of having a new parliament as devoted to the miniſters
as the preſent; after which, theſe miniſters being abſolute maſters for
three years, will eaſily accompliſh their pernicious deſigns, and eſtabliſh
the Pretender in this country.</p>

                        <pb n="492" facs="tcp:0950500102:515"/>
The preſence of the Electoral Prince in the kingdom,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">month </seg>May.</label> will be ſufficient
to defeat this plan of the miniſters. It will encourage the Whigs to get
themſelves choſen, and they will chearfully take upon themſelves all the
expence of the elections, without aſking any thing from his Electoral
Highneſs. The preſence of the prince will alone have a mighty influence
on the elections, and gain over to the well-affected party an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who follow the court only becauſe they are not ſupported by the
ſucceſſor, and are in the miſtaken notion of the Elector's neglecting the
affairs of England. All theſe fears will vaniſh. Every one will attach
himſelf to the prince, and by that means we ſhall have a good parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
after which, his Electoral Highneſs may decide in it as he chooſes,
both with regard to the affairs of the ſucceſſion and the affairs of Europe.</p>
                     <p>The ſending the Electoral Prince then is an infallible remedy againſt
preſent evils, and againſt ſuch as are dreaded hereafter. It is eaſy,
it is natural, it is unexpenſive, and without any riſk in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture;
inſomuch, that I cannot conceal from you, that if our
friends, who aſk it with ſo much earneſtneſs, ſee they are refuſed, they
will believe themſelves abſolutely abandoned, they will hope for no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reſource, they will loſe courage, and take their own meaſures.</p>
                     <p>Lord Halifax would have the prince to come poſt, with a valet de
chambre and two footmen, under another name, without his order of the
garter, and without liveries, and take his paſſage in the pacquet boat,
with a paſſport from lord Strafford, procured under a borrowed name.
The reſt of his ſervants and baggage would follow. In ſhort, the only
queſtion is, to come ſpeedily and ſecretly, and every thing will go well."</p>

                     <p>"LOrd Angleſea is determined to drive the lord Treaſurer to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and has been, for ſome time, in ſtrict connection with the
duke of Argyle. This earl is one of the greateſt Tories, and is not a
good tempered man. He is very haughty, and very ambitious. He is
one of the moſt active men in the world, and does not deviate an inch
from what he hath once undertaken: and being very clever, there is
reaſon to think that the Treaſurer will not conſider him as an indifferent
enemy, and that his hatred will give him room for ſerious reflections.</p>
                     <p>This nobleman is offended at the haughty manner in which the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
treated him; and becauſe he diſcovered that the Treaſurer deſigns
to bring over the Pretender, whom he does not favour, though he is
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:0950500102:519"/>
deep in all the other ſchemes of the Tories: but it is ſaid he has eſtates
in Ireland, which he would be in danger of loſing, if the Pretender came
over.</p>
                     <p>The treaſurer has diſcovered long ago, that he is neither loved nor
eſteemed by any party. The affront he lately received, when the treaty
of commerce was thrown out, makes him ſenſible of the danger to which
he is expoſed, and will haſten the execution of his deſign of bringing
over the Pretender, to which the Queen's ſtate of health will be a further
inducement. The King of France likewiſe is offended for loſing the
advantages he would have obtained by that treaty, and will contribute
every thing in his power to ſend over the Pretender. The preſence of
the prince, is the only remedy againſt thefe and other evils."</p>

                     <p>L'Hermitage writes, that if they fail, their want of ſucceſs will be

the emoluments of government, which will not perhaps be ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
The Treaſurer having propoſed a reconciliation with the Whigs
after their fall, they aſſured him, that they would willingly renounce all
pretenſions to offices, and ſupport his meaſures with all their force, if
he would humble France, and free them from their fears of the Pretender.

the Queen's death, he would do every thing which the nation could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

                     <p>The Elector does the greateſt ſervice to the well-affected in England,
which the ſtate of affairs in Europe in general, and his own particular
ſituation will allow, when he engages the Emperor and the Empire to
continue the war againſt France, and employs 17,000 of his own troops
againſt that kingdom. This puts it out of the King of France's power
to ſend an army with the Pretender into England, and it is not to be
ſuppoſed that he will venture to go without a French army, ſince he is
proſcribed by the laws, and has the nation againſt him. If he does, will
the friends of the ſucceſſion, who are ſo rich, and have ſo much influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

cannot ſave them againſt their will.</p>
                     <p>The Elector is at ſo much expence on the troops he employs on the
Rhine, that he cannot give the money demanded for the elections. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,

There are ſeveral objections againſt ſending the Electoral Prince.
There can be no ſecurity for a ſafe paſſage. It will be impoſſible for
him to go ſecretly. The miniſtry might put obſtacles in his way; and
they might ſubject him to mortifications after his arrival. The Elector
has been ſo often amuſed theſe two years, with falſe intelligence of the
Queen's health, that he does not know but her death may be ſtill very
diſtant; and it would be imprudent in him, upon an uncertainty, to
expoſe his only ſon and the only hope of his family."</p>

                  <p>"I Had the honour of your letter of the firſt of Auguſt. There is no
doubt but that, if the Queen happens to die before the miniſters
here have adjuſted their meaſures with France, for bringing over the
prince of Wales, the friends of the family here will have ſtrength enough
to ſupport their cauſe until the Elector arrives, and they are all of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that the preſence of the Elector would be infinitely more uſeful
than that of the Electoral Prince, not only in that caſe, but even at this
very time. But as they imagine that the Elector would not chooſe to
come before the Queen's death, they propoſed that the Electoral Prince
ſhould come, as he has ſuch a juſt pretext for this, which regards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
alone, being a peer of the realm; and they propoſe this not only in
view of the Queen's dying ſoon, for the danger is then by no means ſo
great, but in order to have a ſupport, and ſome one to counteract the
deſigns of the miniſtry, who will uſe the authority of the Queen while
ſhe lives; the adminiſtration of affairs, which the laws place in their
hands, for concerting ſuch meaſures with France, that the Pretender will
be here in an inſtant, and then it will be too late to prevent him.</p>
                  <p>All this is ſo clear to common ſenſe, and muſt be particularly ſo to
the Elector, who knows better than any one the engagements of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
with France, that it is very ſurpriſing he ſhould heſitate a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and from any jealouſy he may have of the Electoral Prince. If
he will come himſelf, as I had often the honour to tell you, all his
friends will rejoice at it more than at the coming of the Electoral Prince.
But if he will neither come himſelf nor ſend the Electoral Prince, I aſſure
you that all friends, of all ranks, will conſider themſelves as abandoned.
Perhaps this will not be reliſhed at Hannover; but I would not be a
faithful ſervant to the Elector and to the Proteſtant ſucceſſion, if I did
not acquaint you with the juſt ſtate of the affair.</p>

was propoſed, with regard to money, is rejected, and that the Elector will
neither come himſelf, nor allow his ſon to come, we ſhall become tired,

                  <p>THIS letter regards almoſt entirely his journey and arrival in London, and Kreyenberg having placed the lottery tickets belonging to the
Electreſs in the hands of Mr. Strafford, a merchant, who failed ſome time
ago, and ſome other private buſineſs. "The duke of Argyle continues
to be on very bad terms with lord Oxford. Neither the one nor the other
are now in town. It is believed that Sir Thomas Hanmer is entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
with lord Oxford. L'Hermitage aſſures me, that the miniſtry

prejudiced againſt our family, and that the impreſſions they have
given her in that way are ſo ſtrong, that it is judged impoſſible to efface
them. Lord Oxford leads her implicitly; making her believe that all
his meaſures were neceſſary to preſerve her crown, after having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
her that the Whigs had a deſign of depriving her of it. One is at a

to put him on his guard againſt ſome one, "I never truſted any one; I
am determined not to truſt any one for the future; conſequently no one
deceived me, or can deceive me." He promiſes the ſame thing to five

but they are divided in their opinion of the manner. The
moſt unreaſonable among them would chooſe that, without depending

that he ſhould come alone, after having written to the Queen, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>Such a repreſentation, in their opinion, would have ſo much the greater
influence on the Queen's mind, that it is certain ſhe attributes the loſs of
her children to the dethroning of her father; having been very ſenſibly
touched with an affecting letter which he wrote to her before his death,
and in which he recommended his family to her. It was brought to her

France, of the Pretender, and of the Queen's miniſtry, was playing a

                  <p>"I Saw lord Sunderland at Kreyenberg's the day before yeſterday. He
does not deſpair of the affairs of this country, as many others do.
He thinks the Treaty of Commerce will be rejected, although a better
one will be preſented to this parliament, than that which was rejected by
the laſt. He aſſures me the duke of Argyle, who paſſed ſome days with
him in the country, may be depended upon. He thinks him incapable
of ever reconciling himſelf with the miniſter; as he acknowledges now
that he acted formerly on wrong principles, and is diſſatisfied with his
brother for having ſhuffled, <hi>i. e.</hi> for having paid court to the lord trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
in hopes that he would have made him one of the 16 Scotch peers.
The misfortune is, that he has thereby neglected to be choſen in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the court, which the duke thinks he could not have miſſed to
be, if he had ſpoke out, and employed the intereſt of his friends in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
They ſay he is diſguſted at having been played the fool with in
this manner, and diſappointed in his hopes; and he muſt have exerted
himſelf very much and with great ſucceſs, though chiefly out of ſpite, in
order to carry the elections of the commons in Scotland againſt the court,
ſince it is certain that, of 45 members, there are 34 or 35 Whigs.</p>
                  <p>Young Mr. Murray, who is known at Hannover, has changed ſides,
and is now a ſpy of the lord treaſurer's, who detached him to me the day
before yeſterday. He had the imprudence to regret to me, that many were
choſen who were diſagreeable to the court, and who were puniſhed by the
laſt parliament."</p>

                     <p>"THE duke of Argyle, with whom I was this morning, aſſured me
ſtrongly, that the lord treaſurer could not be depended on; that
he knew him better than any one, from his own experience; and that he
was very ſure, that he exerted himſelf with all his might againſt the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
and for the Pretender. His intimate friends muſt have ſaid, that
he was too far engaged to withdraw, and that he was forced to moſt of
the things which he did. The duke of Argyle aſſured me, that very
odd queſtions were put to the officers, of whom the treaſurer was not
entirely ſure; and that he broke them, when their anſwers did not pleaſe
him. He behaves in the ſame manner to thoſe who have other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>The offer which the elder Mr. Murray made me, this morning,
of carrying me to the lord treaſurer, and which I thought proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe,
proceeded, undoubtedly, from the lord treaſurer himſelf. This

                     <p>"THE Duke of Argyle coming to ſee me, the day after I waited
on him, ſpoke to me with great openneſs; telling me among
many other particulars, that he conſtantly ſpoke to the Queen about
the ſucceſſion; but, however frequently, could never obtain any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
from her. As the duke ſometimes obſerved, that he was not well
received by her Majeſty, he aſcribed the cauſe of this, to the malicious
reports which had been made to her of his conduct, and he entreated her
to let him know what he was accuſed of, that he might exculpate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by informing her of the truth; but having never been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that favour, he conjured her to compare the freedom and the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:0950500102:535"/>
with which he always told her his opinion concerning affairs in
general, and concerning his diffidence of ſome perſons who had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of approaching her frequently, without enjoining ſecrecy, with the
manner in which they ſpoke to her, in order to judge who acted moſt
honourably to her. But ſtill he had no anſwer."</p>
                     <p>"Monſieur de Pleſſen confirmed the truth of all this to Schutz. The
duke of Argyle thought it was abſolutely neceſſary to gain lord Angleſey
and Sir Thomas Hanmer. The friends of the ſucceſſion offered to aſſiſt
Hanmer in being choſen ſpeaker; and he aſſured them, that he was
under no engagements with the court."</p>

                     <p>"LORD Halifax is very happy at the ſteps which the Queen's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
were obliged to take, at Utrecht, by the biſhop of London.
He hopes it will furniſh an opportunity, in the enſuing parliament, of
doing ſomething for the further ſecurity of the ſucceſſion, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Electoral family; as he is perſuaded, it was unwillingly
the Queen's miniſters took ſuch a ſtep. For he believes them diſpoſed,
from inclination and duty, to favour the Pretender. He flatters himſelf
that our affairs are not ſo deſperate as we imagine, and that our enemies
meet with difficulties which we are ignorant of, and which forced them
to ſuch a meaſure. In ſhort, he hopes, whether the Pretender ſtays in
Lorrain or leaves it, that means will be found in the enſuing ſeſſion of
parliament, to take advantage of this ſtep againſt them.</p>
                     <p>It was, on this occaſion, the Queen muſt have written to the Pretender
to inform him, that it was againſt her will ſhe took that ſtep, aſſuring him,
that his intereſts were always dear to her; that ſhe would take all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
care of them; that it was not yet the time to declare herſelf,
and a great deal more in the ſame ſtrain, and even treating him as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But as ſuch a letter muſt have been written very privately, it is
difficult to conceive how any notice could be got of it, and it is neceſſary
not to diſcover any diffidence of the Queen in that reſpect, as the bad
conſequence of that would fall back upon us."</p>

though high treaſon by our laws, yet this book which aſſerts them, was

following circumſtances. Firſt the matterials for it were collect'd either
out of manuſcripts in his own library, or out of ſuch publick recordes
as Mr. Lowndes was known to have been employed in the ſerch of;
Ld. T—r, library keeper, corrected the manuſcript, and the printing
of the book was publiſh'd in the Gazet, and though the printer was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up for form's ſake, the ſale of the book is openly permitted, and
great numbers of them ſent gratis all over the kingdome. Many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the ſame nature might be joyned to theſe I have mentioned;
but I think theſe more then ſufficient to demonſtrate the views of
the miniſtry, and the dainger of delaying any longer the entering into ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
meaſures for the preventing of them. But as this matter is of the
higheſt moment, and that the ſafety of our religon, property and liberty
will depend upon the reſolutions to be now taken, our friends in England
ſubmit every thing to his Electoral Highneſs's great wiſdom and
diſcretion, and will execute with zeal and pleaſure, whatever inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or orders he ſhall pleaſe to give them in this moſt important affaire.
However, they beleive themſelves oblidged, at the ſame time, both in
duty to his Electoral Highneſs and out of concern for the ſafety and good
of their country, to repreſent, in the moſt humble and ſubmiſſive maner,
that conſidering the preſent ſtate of things in England, nothing can ſo
effectually aſſure the ſucceſſion, as his Electoral Highneſs going there;
or, if that can not be hoped for, the ſending the prince, which would
animate and encorage, to the greateſt degree, all thoſe of both partys,
who wiſh well to the ſucceſſion, and break the meaſures of thoſe who

England, yet they leave and wholly ſubmit it to his Electorale Highneſs
prudence and judgement, and deſire that this their advice may be underſtood
to proceed from hearts ful of affection and unalterable attachement to his
Electoral Highneſs perſon and intereſts; for the promoting of which
they will be allways ready to venture their lives and fortunes. As I write
you this, in the laſt confidence, I deſire it may be comunicated only
to his Electoral Highneſs and Monſieur Bernſtorf, and for fear of acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,

                  <p>CADOGAN was at the Hague, and gave to Bothmar a memorial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſtate of affairs in England, and the means of retrieving
them. It was to be ſent to the Elector, and drawn up in ſuch a way, that
it might be communicated to the well affected Tories: but he mentioned
ſeveral other particulars to Bothmar, which the latter writes to his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
in this letter. The Elector ſhould aſſure the Tories, that the
Whigs would reſign to them offices and employments. If the Electoral
Prince would go to England, there were 50 or 60 great men who would
hazard their fortunes and their lives to ſerve him. If the Elector him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
would go, they would furniſh him any ſums of money that he ſhould
judge neceſſary for the execution of his deſigns. A proof of the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of this was, that eight or ten perſons were able to furniſh the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:0950500102:543"/>
with three millions. They would furniſh money much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
for the preſervation of their own country.</p>
                  <p>They again entreated his Electoral Highneſs very earneſtly to grant
the penſions they aſk for ſome poor lords, who want neceſſary ſubſiſtence;
and if they cannot engage his Electoral Highneſs to agree to any thing
they propoſe, they will endeavour to provide for themſelves as well as
they can, and yield to the times. "He told me, that the dutcheſs of
Marlborough was to return to England in ſpring, and that perhaps the
duke would do ſo likewiſe; for being now 66 years of age, it was proper
for him to think of dying in peace in his native country, if he could. If
we will do nothing ourſelves to ſecure the ſucceſſion, we cannot expect it
without a miracle. I am afraid we will not get off with the loſs of our
hopes of that ſucceſſion, and that ſo much trouble will be given to us,
and ſo many enemies raiſed againſt us elſewhere, that we will not be either
in peace or ſafety in the Electorate, until we ſhall be ſo low, that they
may be aſſured they have nothing further to apprehend from us."</p>
                  <p>"You recollect, that both the duke of Marlborough and Cadogan
have proviſional orders from the Electreſs to take the command of the
troops and of garriſons in caſe of the Queen's death. Cadogan told me,
it would be proper to have a particular one for Mr. Armſtrong quarter-maſter
general, who commands at Dunkirk, to ſeize upon that place,
and execute the orders of Marlborough or Cadogan. That order may
remain in the duke of Marlborough's hands, until it will be time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute

according to the laws ſuch orders are not valid; but he ſays, that officers
and ſoldiers, ſo very well affected as they are, will not examine the point
ſo narrowly, and will be ſatisfied with ſeeing the name and the ſeal of the
Electreſs; and when once the thing is done, reaſons will be eaſily found

                  <p>"IN anſwer to the letter, with which I have been honoured from your
Royal Highneſs, concerning the deſigns of the Chevalier de St.
George to be allied to the family of Auſtria, I ſhall tell you that I have
communicated them to the prince of Trauſton, who willingly undertook
the commiſſion to the Emperor, and even gave me reaſon to expect a
ſpeedy anſwer, which I have waited for from day to day; but your Royal
Highneſs knows, that they are not as expeditious, at this court, as one
could wiſh. Accordingly I have not been able to obtain an anſwer until
laſt night, when the prince ſent for me very late to tell me, that he had
given an account to the Emperor of what I had ſaid to him concerning
the Chevalier de St. George; that his Majeſty had appeared to reliſh the
propoſal, but found the preſent times too critical to be able to come to
a determination; adding, that he did not believe that it was the intereſt
of the Chevalier de St. George to determine any thing poſitively, in the
preſent conjuncture, and that he was diſpoſed to give the Chevalier
marks of eſteem and regard when the occaſions offered. This, in a few
words, is the anſwer that was made to me. I remarked, however, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
the converſation with the prince of Trauſton, that, far from being
averſe from this alliance, they would deſire it much; eſpecially if the
Chevalier de St. George was reſtored to his dominions, as it is not doubted
will happen in a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>This miniſter found, that there was a diſproportion of age, between
the Chevalier de St. George and the youngeſt of the archdutcheſſes, niece
to the reigning Emperor; and that they would be more inclined to ſettle
the youngeſt of the archdutcheſſes, his ſiſter, the firſt being only twelve;

wherein you informed me of the Emperor's anſwer to what I had
written to you concerning the deſigns of the Chevalier de St. George, with
regard to the alliance he would chooſe to form with the family of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.
The reaſon of my delay has been, that I could not till now find
an opportunity of giving information to the Chevalier de St. George,
who appeared to me to be very ſenſible of the marks of regard and eſteem
which the Emperor has ſhewn him; and he has given me in charge to
write to you about this, in order that by my orders you might ſhow that
he has a grateful ſenſe of the Emperor's behaviour; that he has a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

friendſhip and regard, which the Emperor has teſtified for him. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
himſelf in the moſt obliging terms. You will, therefore, execute
this commiſſion as ſoon as you receive my letter. I will even tell you,
as from myſelf, that I thought I had perceived the Chevalier de St.
George would have wiſhed that he himſelf could have written to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
to ſhew his gratitude; but that he did not believe it became him
to write for the firſt time as an incognito. I want to know, though for
no other reaſon but pure curioſity, if the Emperor would receive or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
a letter from the Chevalier de St. George, and write to him as
King.</p>
                  <p>I forgot to tell you, that I had for a long time the curioſity to aſk you,
as particular an account as you could give me of the temper, the genius,
and the education of the four archdutcheſſes, the ſiſters and the nieces;
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:0950500102:548"/>
and as I have the pictures of all the Emperors, I would chooſe likewiſe

are my ſentiments; and, had I others, or ſhould I act contrary to thoſe I

rightful heirs are there to the crown after me, who being powerful fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
may have inclinations equal to their power, and may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
never give reſt to England, till they enſlave it in good earneſt?</p>
                  <p>Will my ſubjects be always ſo blinded, as to make a monſter of what
is in effect their greateſt ſecurity; and not perceive and endeavour to
prevent the real and juſt cauſes they have of fear and apprehenſion?</p>
                  <p>My preſent ſincerity, at a time it may coſt me ſo dear, ought to be
a ſufficient earneſt to them of my religious obſervance of whatever I

                  <p>"THIS moment Mr. Strickland is arrived with the letter, which you
did me the honour to write to me. Behold then, at laſt, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
arrived which muſt decide your fortune! You have taken the only
proper courſe, by going to Paris; and I hope that you will find at the
court of France the ſuccours which are neceſſary for ſecuring the ſucceſs
of your enterpriſe. The honour which you did me, Sir, during your
ſtay in my dominions, and the liberty with which you allowed me to tell
you my ſentiments, induce me to entreat you now to remember, that by
the death of Queen Anne, France is free of all engagements with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
thoſe which had been contracted by the moſt Chriſtian King hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been only with the Queen perſonally, and not with the Engliſh
nation. This leaves France without any engagement, and in a ſituation
to ſupport you without any reproach. But, Sir, this ſupport, when too
public, may not be advantageous to you; and in my opinion, as I have
had the honour of repreſenting to you ſeveral times already, the moſt
eſſential ſuccours are, not to allow you to want money, to ſecure your
paſſage by ſome ſhips, and to permit you to take along with you the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
troops, which would not alarm any one in England; whereas
French troops certainly would.</p>
                  <p>Some arms and ammunition will be no leſs neceſſary; ammunition
may be eaſily found at Calais, and for fear of loſing time, arms may be
taken from the troops which work at the new harbour near Dunkirk; for
they may make ſome difficulties about the time which will be neceſſary
for furniſhing theſe things. If the duke of Berwick, as you believed,
was not deſirous of attending you, he has ſucceeded: but, Sir, I entreat
you to remember that a good officer, who is not a ſtranger, is neceſſary
for you. I have no doubts but you will land in Scotland; it is upon
that kingdom, it appears to me, you ought principally to depend. You
will probably find there a greater number of friends; and beſides, it is a
country in which you can better maintain your ground. The diſunion of
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:0950500102:551"/>
that kingdom is the meaſure, which will attach them moſt to you. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
me, Sir, this detail; but amidſt the great occupations, in which
you are engaged, you may not perhaps recollect this, of which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
you yourſelf are convinced. My zeal makes me take too much
liberty, which you will be pleaſed to excuſe; as well as any omiſſion I
may have been guilty of, during your ſtay in this country. I can do
nothing now, but pray God to bleſs your undertaking, and to preſerve
your health; beſeeching you, Sir, to grant me your protection, and to
be perſuaded of my zeal, which will not ceaſe but with my life.</p>

that he never believed lord Oxford ſincere in his deſigns to ſerve
the King, till one day Abbé Gaultier came to him on a very particular
occaſion.</p>
                  <p>He had had with lord Oxford a conference about the King's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
in which lord Oxford was giving him his ſentiments, in relation to
the conduct that the King ought to obſerve to carry his point. The
Abbeé ſaid, he might forget, and deſired lord Oxford to put them in
writing; he did ſo, and gave the paper to the abbé, deſiring him to
tranſcribe it and reſtore it to him, next day. When the abbé, came home,
though he underſtood Engliſh pretty well, yet it was ſo bad wrote, that
the abbé could not read it. In this difficulty, knowing none to truſt ſo
nice an affair with but L. L. he came to him, and told him the caſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to tranſcribe it for him, which he did in ſo legible a hand, that
the abbé could read it, and tranſcribed it afterwards himſelf, time enough
to reſtore it next morning to lord Oxford; (L. L. thought him always
ſincere afterwards).</p>

proclamation was ordered to be iſſued out againſt—, he was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to the cabinet council, at K—, and it being whiſpered, that it was
in order to ſuch an affair; he meeting lord Oxford, aſked him if it was:
lord Oxford ſaid, he knew nothing of it; that he did not meddle in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:0950500102:553"/>
and that he would be againſt it if propoſed. Soon after he met lord
B. and aſking him about it, and expreſſing his wonder, that they ſhould
think of ſuch a thing after it had been ſo carried in the houſe of lords;
B. denied that he knew any thing of it. Afterwards they were called
into council, where the Queen giving no body time to ſpeak, ſaid ſhe
had reſolved on a proclamation, which ſhe cauſed to be read, and then,
without ſtaying for, or aſking any body's advice, went out: ſo that it was
all her own act. Aſking lord Bolingbroke afterwards how it came to
be iſſued out, in ſuch a manner, he ſaid, lord Trevor (who was then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to him) poſitively inſiſted on it that it ſhould be done, and he was
forced to comply.</p>
                  <p>May 30, 1726, at ſupper, at L. S.'s, L. L. was giving an account of
the ſtruggle between lord B. and lord Oxford. The latter was abſolute
at firſt, and lady Maſham hated L. B. who was only kept in, becauſe the
peace was tranſacting, and nobody elſe could ſpeak French. At laſt,
lord Oxford, diſobliging lady Maſham, in the affair of Quebec, ſhe joined
L. B. and lord Oxford was turned out a little before the Queen died.
The deſign of L. B. at the time, was to bring about the Hannover ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion:
and two or three days before her death, L. L. and Sir W.
Windham going in a coach together, the firſt ſaid, Now they had got
the power entirely into their hands, they might eaſily bring about a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration;
to which Sir W. ſaid, Put that out of your head; that will
never be:—is an impracticable man (<hi>i. e.</hi> he would not change his
religion at that moment) and will never be brought in: and L. L. going
on the Saturday evening (before the Queen died) to Kenſington, met
Arthur Moore and John Drummond waiting for L. B. (who dined with
S. W. W. and a great deal of company that day, at Blackheath), who
did not come, though John was appointed to attend there for L. B. to
receive his laſt inſtructions, in order to ſet out the next day for Hannover,
to make up matters with that court. This John Drummond himſelf
told L. L.; but the Queen's death did not allow them time to execute
their ſcheme, and they could never make the court believe they had any
ſuch ſchemes.</p>

                  <p>"L. L. on the 28th of June, 1725, told me, that Mr. Harley, at the
time he was bringing about the change in the miniſtry, in 1710,
was near quarrelling with lord Harcourt and Bolingbroke. He had a
mind to fix them in their old poſts of ſecretary of war and attorney-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
But the one inſiſted on being lord chancellor, and the other ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of ſtate; which he refuſing to agree to, they came to L. L. and told
him the caſe, and that there was no doing any thing with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they determined to go, the one into Oxfordſhire and the other into
Berkſhire, next morning; and as he was to ſtay in town, they begged of
him to ſhew himſelf cool and reſerved to him. L. L. ſaid, he was ſorry
for the occaſion of their going; but he would not quarrel with an old
friend without reaſon. They ſaid, all that they deſired of him was, to
ſhew himſelf cool to Mr. Harley, which he determined to do. After they
were gone, lord L. wrote a letter to Mr. Harley, acquainting him with
Harcourt and Bolingbroke's being with him and their reſolution; and
told him very plainly, that if he went on at this rate, he would loſe all his
friends, and nobody would have any thing to do with him; repreſented
the conſequences and deſired him to conſider them. He left a copy of
this letter in England. Harley and Bolingbroke, after parting with L. L.
had gone to Mr. Harley's, and this letter was delivered to Mr. Harley,
whilſt they were with him, and they ſaw the ſuperſcription to be
lord L's hand. Bolingbroke aſked L. L. afterwards, what was in the
letter; for, he ſaid, he never ſaw a man ſo ſtruck, in his life time, as
Harley was after reading it. The iſſue was, Harcourt and Bolingbroke
were ſatisfied, and ſtaid in town.</p>
                  <p>Harley uſed often to complain to lord L. of the Tories having been
cut out of buſineſs for above twenty years, and of their unfitneſs for it;
and had, therefore, a mind to bring over a capable Whig or two. But
the leaſt motion of it put the Tories in a ſlame, and he could not do it.</p>
                  <p>Harcourt had complained often, in very feeling terms, to lord L. that
he knew no more of the meaſures of the court, though he was L. C. than
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:0950500102:555"/>
his footman. That lord Bolingbroke had not made him a viſit of a
year, and lord Oxford did not ſo much as know him. But juſt before
the Queen died, Bolingbroke brought him into his meaſures, and they
were entire confidents.</p>
                  <p>Oxford and Bolingbroke had always been puſhing one another, from
the very time of their power, and labouring to ſupplant each other.
Lord Oxford told L. L. upon aſking when he had ſeen Harry St. John,
and L. L. anſwering, that Harry was a man of buſineſs, and he had not
ſeen him of a long while, that Bolingbroke was betraying all their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
to lord Marlborough; and that he owed the finding out of the ſecret
to little Dartmouth, and Eraſmus Lewis had made the diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, lord Marlborough was very fond always of Harry St.
John; and, on the loſs of his ſon, the lord Blandford, ſaid he had no
comfort leſt, but in Harry St. John, whom he loved and conſidered as
his ſon: and, notwithſtanding the difference, on account of Party,
the duke always had a regard for him.</p>
                  <p>Bolingbroke, in the midſt of his ſtruggle with lord Oxford, was hated
mortally by lady Maſham and abominated by the Queen, for his looſe
life, and Oxford was in the height of his credit; ſo that he muſt have
fallen, if he had not been neceſſary for the ſcheme of the peace, he
being the only man about court that could ſpeak French, or tranſact any
thing with Meſnager or the other perſons ſent over by the court of
France, or to be ſent into France.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time, or a little after the firſt overtures of peace, the
Quebec expedition was ſet on foot, in which lord Oxford refuſed to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
Mrs. Maſham, in an affair relating to it, by which ſhe would have
got a good ſum of money. She, though his relation, reſented this high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Bolingbroke improved the moment, ſtruck in with her and told her,
he would get it done, in ſpite of lord Oxford. He did ſo; and ſhe ſtood
by him afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Lord Oxford, who was for ſerving the King<note n="‖" place="bottom">This ſeems to be a miſtake.</note>, fancied Bolingbroke was
engaged in that ſcheme; and therefore, thought to ſtrike in with the H.
of H. This completed his ruin; and he was miſtaken in his point: for
Bolingbroke's view was the H. of H. and the night after lord Oxford
was out, L. L. came to Kenſington, to get the Queen to ſign ſome papers,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:0950500102:556"/>
which he deferred upon the dutcheſs of Ormond, (who was then in waiting)
her telling, that the Queen was ſomething indiſpoſed; but ſhe would
acquaint her, if his lordſhip pleaſed. But, he ſaid, it was no matter of
conſequence, and he would not diſturb her. He ſaw there waiting for
lord Bolingbroke, who failed them, Charles Caeſar, John Drummond,
&amp;c. John was to part in a day's time, for Holland, to engage lord Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle
to negociate for them, with the court of Hannover; and theſe and
others then in waiting, as John Drummond himſelf told L. L. were
all in that ſcheme. The earl's death blew up this affair; that miniſtry
laſting only three days, and the houſe of Hannover not ſenſible of their
obligation to them.</p>
                  <p>Lord Marlborough landing, as it were, the moment of the Queen's
death, I was apt to fancy, he might be in that ſcheme; but L. L. ſaid,
he did not believe it; and he heard lord Bolingbroke, in company with
himſelf, lord Bath, and others, on the day of the duke's entry into Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
ſpeak with a violent reſentment upon it, and ſay, He ought to be
ſent to the Tower for it.</p>
                  <p>December the 13th, Mrs. A. O. told me, that lord Oxford oppoſed
the duke of Ormond's liſt of new officers for the army, becauſe it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of Bagnals, Mathews, and other Iriſh, and becauſe the duke of
Ormond inſiſted, that the officers turned out ſhould be paid for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
and poſts which they had purchaſed with their blood, which the
new officers propoſed were not able to do; nor could the Exchequer
then ſupply 50,000 <hi>l.</hi> which was the leaſt it amounted to. That,
upon lady Maſham's quarrel with lord Oxford, about her ſhare in the
10 per cent. reſerved out of the Aſſiento contract, which was intended to
be ſhared between her, &amp;c. She ſent for A O. to apply to the duke of
Ormond; who ſaid, ſhe could not pretend to have ſo much credit with
the duke, though perhaps her mother might. That her mother was ſent
for, and ſhe (A. O.) went to Sir John Stapleton's, where the duke was to
ſup, fetched him away to Kenſington, where lady Maſham told him how
ill the Queen was, and how uneaſy at nothing being done for her brother;
and that, if he would but ſecure her 30,000 <hi>l.</hi> of the ten per cent, which
amounted to 100,000 <hi>l.</hi> ſhe would join with him, and he ſhould have the
modelling of the army, &amp;c. as he pleaſed. He was afterwards introduced
to the Queen, who was ill, (this was the year before her death) in order
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:0950500102:557"/>
to offer his ſervice to ſerve her brother, and have the modelling of the
army, &amp;c. granted him: but inſtead of giving any aſſurances or making
any propoſals to the Queen, who was prepared to grant him every thing;
he only aſked her, if ſhe had any commands for him, and went away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſaying more.</p>
                  <p>The duke of Ormond took it ill of lord Oxford, that when he deſired
1200 <hi>l.</hi> a year penſion might be ſettled on lady Hales, lord Oxford pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to make the duke's own penſion 6000 <hi>l.</hi> inſtead of 5000 a year, and
offered to get it done, and then the duke might give her as much on his
own eſtate: but lady Hales piqued herſelf on having a penſion from the
Queen; and made the duke refuſe the offer and quarrel with lord Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
who would not grant the 1200 <hi>l.</hi> a year penſion.</p>
                  <p>When lord Oxford was turned out, Bolingbroke's ſcheme and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court's
was for the houſe of Hannover, to make the duke of Marlborough
general, and if the duke of Ormond ſubmitted to it, to allow him the poſt
of lord-lieutenant of Ireland; if not, to turn him out of all, and ſlight him."</p>

houſe of Hannover, there is no reaſon to believe, that the whole
of that party were friends to the Pretender. The bigotry of that prince,
in adhering, with ſuch obſtinacy, to the Romiſh faith, cooled the zeal of
thoſe who were moſt attached to the line of hereditary ſucceſſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
many Tory leaders, diſappointed in their own views upon office, and
offended, upon that account, with the lord treaſurer, began to cabal with
the Whigs. Among theſe was the earl of Angleſea, a man of quick
parts, but revengeful in his diſpoſition. This earl, together with Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Dawes, the ſucceſſor of arch-biſhop Sharpe, in the ſee of York, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
great influence with the Tories. On the 5th of April, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
year, they joined themſelves to the Whigs; when, upon a diviſion
in the houſe of lords, the proteſtant ſucceſſion was, by a ſmall majority,
voted out of danger. They were followed by the whole bench of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
by the earls of Abingdon and Jerſey, the lords Aſhburnham and
Carteret, and ſome other temporal peers of the High Church party.
Their principles, however, were not the ſole motives of this deſertion.
The means by which Angleſea, the arch-biſhop, and their friend Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Hanmer, were gained to the houſe of Hannover, are explained, upon
more ſolid grounds, in the following papers.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the votes in parliament, the ſecurity of laws which
had never been infringed, and the manifeſt attachment of a great majority
of the nation, the family of Hannover, miſled by the ignorance of their
agents and the violence of the Whigs, continued to think, that their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to the throne was in the utmoſt danger. The Elector himſelf,
haraſſed and fatigued, by the eagerneſs of his agents, and the vehement
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:0950500102:559"/>
remonſtrances of thoſe who called themſelves his friends, had become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
indifferent, about a throne ſo difficult to mount. He had, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole courſe of the preceding year, declined to gratify the
Whigs, in ſending over the Electoral Prince. He refuſed to ſatisfy
either their avarice or their wants with penſions. He would not give them
money to influence the general elections in their favour. He rejected
their violent propoſal of invading the kingdom with an army. Having
failed to awaken the ambition of his Highneſs, they applied themſelves
to his humanity and his fears. They repreſented, that their liberties,
their fortunes, and, perhaps, their lives were in the utmoſt danger, ſhould
the Pretender ſucceed to the throne. They inſinuated, that neither the
Elector himſelf nor his family could be ſafe, upon that event, in the
heart of Germany: that a prince, who conſidered them as rivals in the
ſucceſſion, would never ſit down contented, till he had reduced them ſo
low, as to ceaſe to be an object of terror. This laſt conſideration had,
at length, ſuch an effect upon his Highneſs, that he permitted his envoy
in London to demand a writ of ſummons to the Electoral Prince, as duke
of Cambridge; a tranſaction that made a great noiſe at the time, and is
fully explained in the following papers.</p>
               <p>The attention of the people having been gradually raiſed by this and
ſimilar circumſtances, the Queen and her ſervants found it abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

They had hitherto ſucceeded, notwithſtanding the arts of the
Whigs, in eſtabliſhing a general opinion, that a perfect harmony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
between the courts of Great Britain and Hannover. Whatever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
the Queen might have had for her brother, a great part of it was
obliterated, by his bigotted attachment to a ſyſtem of religion which ſhe
abhorred. She, however, ſecretly wiſhed that he might ſucceed her in
the throne. But her ſervants would be extremely willing to retain their
power, by gaining the good graces of the houſe of Hannover<note n="*" place="bottom">

ſecurities the Elector thought neceſſary for the ſucceſſion of his family to

This, ſhe thought, was the ſame thing as to deſcend from the throne. She
and her miniſters were much blamed by the Whigs, for refuſing to invite

               </p>
               <p>The lord treaſurer, while a commoner, and ſpeaker of the houſe, voted
for all the acts that were paſſed in different ſeſſions of parliament, for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
and ſecuring the ſucceſſion in the proteſtant line. Notwithſtanding
what has been ſuppoſed by the court of Hannover, and aſſerted, with
uniform vehemence, by the Whigs, no deciſive proofs can be advanced,
that he ever favoured the Pretender, during the four years of his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.
In the two laſt years, when he found himſelf declining in the
Queen's favour, and felt a conſequent diminution of his influence in the
cabinet, he made all advances to the court of Hannover, conſiſtent with
the aukwardneſs of his manner, the reſerve of his temper, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of ſecrecy and deſign, which he thought abſolutely neceſſary for
a miniſter, and which he probably uſed to conceal his own want of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
talents. A diſcerning reader will perceive, even through the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
and prejudices of the Hannoverian agents, that this unfortunate
man wiſhed ſincerely to ſecure a retreat for himſelf, behind the ſucceſſion
in the proteſtant line. He paid no court to the Jacobites and high Tories,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:0950500102:561"/>
that was not abſolutely neceſſary for continuing himſelf in office. Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke
was the principal adviſer of all the violent meaſures which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to increaſe the terrors of the Whigs, and to continue the ſuſpicions
of the houſe of Hannover.</p>
               <p>The apprehenſions of thoſe who were, or pretended to be, well-affected
to the ſucceſſion in the houſe of Hannover, were not entirely groundleſs.
The jealouſy of the Electoral family could not altogether have proceeded
from the inventions of faction, the miſrepreſentations of party, or the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or blind zeal of their agents in London. Though Queen Anne
was, perhaps, conveniently free from ſtrong attachments of any kind,
though ſhe was actually too dilatory and unenterpriſing in her nature, and
timid in her diſpoſition, to engage in any dangerous undertaking; though
ſhe was probably as averſe from bringing over the Pretender, during her
life, as ſhe was from ſeeing a prince of the Electoral family reſiding in
the kingdom; yet it can be now no queſtion, but towards the end of her
reign, ſhe was favourably diſpoſed towards her brother, and would have
been well pleaſed, without any trouble or danger to herſelf, to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
for him the eventual ſucceſſion of the throne. He himſelf was no
ſtranger to this circumſtance, and he formed his expectations accordingly.
In a declaration, publiſhed immediately upon her demiſe, he ſays, <q rend="inline">"Of
her good intentions towards us, we could not, for ſome time paſt, well
doubt; and this was the reaſon we then ſat ſtill, expecting the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
thereof, which were unfortunately prevented by her deplorable
death."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The court of Hannover, though the ſuſpicions of their agents were
greater than the truth, could not poſſibly be ſtrangers to the Queen's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Notwithſtanding all the kind aſſurances and proteſtations of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
received from Anne, it was natural for them to ſuſpect her ſincerity,
when they ſaw that all the avowed friends of the Pretender ſupported all
her meaſures. The character and manner of her miniſter were calculated
to increaſe the ſuſpicions of the Electoral family. With ſome abilities,
he poſſeſſed all the weakneſſes, and even ſtooped to the meanneſſes in
which the whole art of every ſhallow politician conſiſts. Regardleſs of
ſincerity, in his political conduct, he often promiſed more than he had
either power or inclination to perform. Flying perpetually from the
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:0950500102:562"/>
point, in his converſation upon buſineſs, he diſguſted mankind in general,
in proportion to the eagerneſs which men entertain concerning their own
affairs. It was only when he meant not to adhere to his word, he gave
any anſwer at all; and that was even then contrived in a way that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it ambiguous. There was an air of ſecrecy in all his manner,
and viſible in every feature of his countenance, and an affectation of myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
and deep deſign, even in trifles. This defect in his character was ſo
little calculated to gain the confidence of others, that it actually expoſed
himſelf to ſuſpicions, when in reality he might have no bad deſigns.</p>
               <p>The repeated charges brought againſt the earl of Oxford, in the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover
papers, may be juſtified by the defects of his own manner and mind.
But his colleagues in office, eſpecially the viſcount Bolingbroke, were
more ſanguine in their temper and determined in their meaſures, An
inveteracy, ariſing from mutual injuries, had ſubſiſted between them and
the Whigs for ſeveral years. It was foreſeen, that an univerſal change of
men and meaſures would take place, upon the demiſe of the Queen: that
the Electoral family would employ the Whigs in the adminiſtration of
their affairs, whenever they mould ſucceed to the crown: that the Tories
would be humbled, and thoſe at preſent in office be in danger of their
lives and fortunes. It was, therefore, natural to ſuppoſe, that men in
ſuch circumſtances had entered into ſecret meaſures to form a ſhelter for
themſelves, againſt the ſtorm which was gathering over their heads. Their
common prudence, if not their principles, might be ſuppoſed to direct
their views to the Pretender. But, notwithſtanding all theſe appearances,
there is reaſon to believe that, had the Queen lived for ſome time longer,
even Bolingbroke would have found means to reconcile himſelf to the
houſe of Hannover; having held an uninterrupted communication with
the duke of Maryborough, who was much more attached to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his own power, than to either of the rivals for the Britiſh
throne.</p>

By the accounts he brings, as well as by what has been write from thence,
it is evident the principal regents of the Republic begin to be now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced

warmly taken the alarm, and ſeem diſpoſed to enter into any meaſures
towards preventing itt, which the form of their government will alow
of; and, as they very well know, a ſtrickt frienſhip with the Emperor
and Empire is abſolutly neceſſary for attaining this great end, they are
at preſent very deſirous to reconcile themſelves to his Imperial Majeſty;
but the managements they are outwarly forced to keep with France and
the Engliſh miniſtry, obliging them to proceed in this matter with the
utmoſt ſecriſy and caution, they are reſolv'd to tranſact it privately, by
ſuch friends as both ſides have an intire confidence in; and, to ſhew how
much they are in earneſt, they appear inclin'd to recede from ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages

friends afore-mention'd, as will re-eſtabliſh the former union between
the Emperor and the Republick; which matter being explain'd in the

apprehenſive that matter may be ſo artfully manag'd by the court, as
to get the firſt part of the propoſition paſt and the other dropt, the ill
conſequences of which are ſo obvious, that it is uneceſſary to explain
them: However, if his E. H. ſhall not approve of what our friends in
England have humbly repreſent'd, they will be ready to execut, with all
the zeal and fidelity imaginable, this or any other thing his Electoral
Highneſs ſhall judge for his ſervice; and ſince the miniſters drive on

if ſomething further be not done in the next ſeſſions of parliament to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes

gave a bad reception to Argyle and Stair, the day before yeſterday, at

frequently, what we have moſt to fear; beſides, if there will be any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

of the Queen's death, but in caſe the Pretender comes during her life.
It is not the want of a leader, in caſe of her death, which embarraſſes;
but who ſhall be a leader in caſe of an enterpriſe by France againſt this
kingdom during her Majeſty's life."</p>

                     <p>"HAving ſpoke, a few days ago, to lord Townſhend and lord Cowper,
on their return from the country, before they had ſeen any of
our friends, they ſaid the very ſame things to me, which I wrote to you
already. I hope, therefore, you will maturely weigh an affair of ſo great
importance, on which depends your ſucceſſion, and the fortune and lives
of thoſe who have your intereſts at heart in this country, and who are
devoted to your ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Conſider further, that if ever the Pretender mounts the throne, (which
he will undoubtedly do, if he comes with a French army, <hi>i. e.</hi> 10 or
12,000 men, before any of the family is here) in what manner England
and France in conjunction will concur in your ruin, and in the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a family, which they will know they diſobliged ſo much, by rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
it of a crown which was deſtined for it, and of which they will not
believe themſelves to be in peaceable poſſeſſion, while that family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
on a good footing. I leave it to you to conſider, what efforts they
will make to ruin it, in one way or other.</p>
                     <p>You muſt be ſufficiently convinced, ever ſince the ſame thing has been
ſo often repeated to you, that the miniſtry of this country make great
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:0950500102:579"/>
efforts to weaken our party among the people, by making them believe,
that the oaths which they take, as well as the act of ſucceſſion, regard the
Electoral family merely becauſe they were the neareſt proteſtant ſucceſſors,
at the time when theſe acts were paſt; and that, as they were paſt merely
to prevent the danger of ſeeing the crown of theſe kingdoms fall into the
hands of a Roman Catholic, the principal deſign was to have a proteſtant
ſucceſſor. That, therefore, it was ſufficient to anſwer that deſign; and
that, to find a proteſtant ſucceſſor, who was nearer of kin than the
Electoral family, would be a thing which was juſt, and to which every
true Engliſhman ought to be naturally inclined.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reaſonings have their weak ſide, of which I wiſh the nation was
as thoroughly perſuaded as I am. But the real ſtate of this kingdom at
preſent is, that all honeſt men, without diſtinction of party, acknowledge,
that although of every ten men in the nation nine ſhould be for us, it is
certain, that of fifteen Tories there are fourteen who would not oppoſe
the Pretender, in caſe he came with a French army; but, inſtead of
making any reſiſtance to him, would be the firſt to receive and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him.</p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe very certain, that if ſome prince of the Electoral family
came now to this country, all thoſe who are at this time in office would
haſten to make their court to him, and things would be made quite ſafe
and ſolidly ſettled in our favour.</p>
                     <p>What anſwer ſhall I make to theſe facts, which I know to be certain!
How can I encourage men, whom you do not chooſe to acknowledge or
ſupport, either by money or by ſending over ſome one of the family? Or,
in ſhort, what other meaſures can I take, which will give them courage,
at a time when they know for certain, that the next ſeſſion of parliament
will not end without enfringing the acts of ſucceſſion? And what remedy
do you imagine you can then apply, which may prevent or diſconcert
their deſign? Is it Mr. Harley's embaſſy, and the manner in which the
lord treaſurer and he explain themſelves to me? Is it the proofs, which
they give you of their attachment at Utrecht? In ſhort, what is it?"</p>
                     <p>For my ſhare, Sir, I entreat you to employ all theſe reaſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
our maſter, without being reſtrained by any apprehenſions of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my fortune thereby. I had rather loſe it, by ſaving men of honour,
who are in the intereſts of his Electoral Highneſs, and by ſhowing him the
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:0950500102:580"/>
true ſtate in which his affairs are in this country, than fail to inform
him of his danger of loſing both his ſucceſſion and perhaps ſomething
elſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things muſt undoubtedly appear diſagreeable to you. Judge
then, how I muſt conſider them, and with what ſatisfaction I can hear
them repeated to me ſo often, by all thoſe who are generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to poſſeſs abilities and zeal, and who have had the conſtancy, till
now, of remaining attached to our intereſts; although, without a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
interpoſition in their favour, as well as in ours, they muſt believe
themſelves to be abſolutely loſt, ſeeing themſelves entirely abandoned by
thoſe in whoſe cauſe they run every kind of riſk."</p>

                  <p>"I Wrote to you, on the 6th of January, and then offered my opinion
of what I thought was for your ſervice. I know not if my letter
came ſafe. Since that time, and before, I have been following out the
method appeared to me the propereſt to advance that intereſt I ſhall ever
ſerve, and which are, to unite upon the main diſtinction of being friends
to the eſtabliſhment and proteſtant ſucceſſion all thoſe whom I had
ground to believe wiſhed well to them, but, by ſome unhappy incidents,
differed in minuter matters: and then to engage thoſe I know to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
friends to that ſucceſſion, and of character and intereſt, in a cloſer
friendſhip and correſpondence with you: both which I have advanced a
good dale, notwithſtanding of ſome rubs I have met with in both, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to be mentioned here, but what you may know afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Matters, ſince that time, have preſſed a little harder. The Queen,
as you muſt know, has been ill; and, upon the firſt notice of it, the
Jacobites, who have been over looked, while others were under diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
and who had provided themſelves in arms, ſeemed ready to
make a puſh for their favourite Pretender; and many of the Popiſh and
Jacobite nobility and gentry came to town, as is ſuſpected with that view.
Whereupon, friends, I can't give their names here, met and conſidered
what might be proper upon this emergency. The ſafety of this place
ſoon appeared to be of the laſt conſequence to the cauſe in general in this
country, both for its being the fate of the government here, and ſo a
right place, more obſervable and important, for the life and ſpirit it muſt
give to meaner and remote places, and becauſe of the public money's
being for the moſt part lodged here: a good morſel for their ſtomachs!</p>
                  <p>To ſecure this place, therefore, the magiſtrates, who are generally well
affected, and who have the executive part of the law in their hands, were
ſpoke to, and deſired earneſtly to augment their guard, and take care it
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:0950500102:582"/>
be in right hands; to arm the honeſt people of the town, and to have a
watchful eye upon all ſtrangers and ſuſpected perſons, to prevent a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
and ſo pary the firſt ſhock, which probably may be the worſt: all
which they radyly enugh agreed to, and I hope will obſerve. Care is
taken to encourage them, by aſſurances of ſupport and advice, which you
know people of their reach and reſolution require not a little; at the ſame
time, what arms can be got are providing for thoſe places of the country
may be truſted, and accounts are given of circumſtances to friends
elſewhere, that things may goe uniformly.</p>
                  <p>I muſt own we have more Jacobites here than in other places of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and that they are but two well provided; but ſtill I am perſuaded,
the honeſt people, with a very ſmall aſſiſtance, will be able to hold head
againſt, if they have non els to deal with; however, care would be taken
that the ſmall number of troops here be ordered and diſpoſed of to the
beſt advantage.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the meaſures were thought at preſent adviſeable, which I
could not advertiſe you of ſooner, I hope they will pleas; and as need
may require, and ther is acceſs, you will ſend advice of what is thought
proper.</p>
                  <p>I ſend you now the reſt of what I promiſed, and what I formerly writ
of; which is no eaſie matter, and which I cannot deſire you to rely upon,
ſo unſixt are the generallity of mankind. However, that I may not fail
in any thing that may poſſiblely be of uſe to you, I have ſent it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the preſent ſituation. You'll underſtand what I now write by
comparing it with what I wrot before. And as to 5, 7, 12, and 14, of
the 1ſt, they have been thought friends of the preſent eſtabliſhment and
ſucceſſion; but their behaviour of late has rendered them ſuſpect. The
reſt have left no ground to doubt them, as you already know.</p>
                  <p>The 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 28,
30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, of the ſecond, have always been
reckoned friends to that eſtabliſhment and ſucceſſion, upon good grounds:
as the 1, 5, 7, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 27, 29, 31, 35, 37, and 40,
have been ſuſpected of being friends to the Pretender.</p>
                  <p>I cannot give you particulars here, but what's write will give you a
view of what you deſired of me. I have ſent alſo a cypher incloſed, by
which I may have occaſion to write. You'll pleas to let me know if it
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:0950500102:583"/>
comes ſafe to hand: ther was a miſtake in my former. Lieut. Col.
George Douglas is a member to the commons in place of Captain Moody,
which you'll pleas to help. I could have ſent you ſome papers are handed
about here, the Highland addreſs, and the Pretender's declaration; but
I know you have them another way, and I would not give you duble
truble. Adieu.</p>

                  <p>"UPON the 'late change of the miniſtry, there was a general rumour
that the Queen was to ſend the earl of Rivers to Hannover, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Elector to ſend a prince of his family to reſide in England, which
at that time the treaſurer gave out as a thing determined upon, and even
told the lords Somers and Halifax, as in great confidence, that the Queen
intended to offer the Elector the command of the army in Flanders, and
this was told in ſuch a manner that theſe lords believed it. But it was
ſoon found that this ſtory was only to amuſe the nation, and to re eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
credit in ſome degree; and that the treaſurer might know the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the houſe, as in the infancy of his miniſtry he could not know
how every individual would allow himſelf to be managed."</p>
                  <p>"The ſame rumour was ſpread two years ago, at the meeting of the
parliament; upon which, however, I will not inſiſt, as it appears to
have been rather a direct mockery, than that the ſituation of affairs then
required it. But now things are come to a criſis; a new parliament is
choſen, and the firſt ſeſſion, which is always a delicate matter, has not the
deſired effect; trade is interrupted; France is victorious over the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and behaves with haughtineſs to her friends as well as enemies. The
lord treaſurer, by his haughtineſs and breaches of promiſe, is perſonally
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:0950500102:588"/>
hated by many people. A conſiderable party begin to make an outcry
about the ſucceſſion and other things. The bank, and conſequently the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
credit, is in a very bad ſituation; the ſtocks fall; the people are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented;
and laſtly, the Queen is in ſo bad a ſtate of health, that nobody
believes ſhe can live long.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch circumſtances, it is not to be wondered that the treaſurer falls
to his old ſhifts, and finding that the report of the duke of Kent's going
to Hannover has little effect (as every body is perſuaded that were the
court in earneſt, one would be ſent of ſome intereſt in either party) he
now gives out, that the Queen has given occaſion to an invitation, and
that ſecretary Bromley was not only to propoſe it to the lower houſe,
but was in perſon to go to Hannover, to deliver the Queen's meſſage.</p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid above of the lord treaſurer's conduct, particularly
with regard to lord Rivers's embaſſy, muſt neceſſarily raiſe doubts, as to his
ſincerity in this,—and not to ſpeak of the Queen's perſonal inclinations,
when one conſiders the lord treaſurer's behaviour, at the very time he
makes ſuch great promiſes, I do not ſee the leaſt regard can be had to
them; I muſt own that one here, on the ſpot, can judge of this better,
than can be ſhown by a letter. I ſhall, however, add one or two remarks.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then, I muſt obſerve in general, that to make ſo great and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
a change of meaſures, is very difficult, and requires near connexions
with another ſet of people, which hitherto has not happened; neither is
the firſt miniſter in ſuch a ſituation, that he can act ſo cavalierly with
France and the Jacobites here, who are not ſo contemptible a party as is
generally believed, without having made up with the other party, as hath
been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>2dly, The Jacobites are more and more encouraged, and are daily
placed in all the ſmall poſts, of which no liſts are kept; and, as to the
great employments, it is certain, that lord Stairs and the duke of Argyle
have loſt theirs.</p>
                  <p>3dly, The court is buſy, at this moment, to get out, by petitions or
otherwiſe, from the houſe of commons, all thoſe who have diſtinguiſhed
themſelves for the ſucceſſion, and particularly an inquiry is made, in a
moſt ſcandalous and inquiſition-like manner, againſt Mr. Walpole, who
has made himſelf formidable, and it is reſolved to have him <hi>per fas et
nefas</hi> voted out of the houſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="566" facs="tcp:0950500102:589"/>
4thly, There is good reaſon to believe, that the report of confirming
the act of regency, which has been ſpoken of, is not without grounds,
nay, that it appears to be really reſolved upon; and the ſucceſs of
this matter is the leſs doubted of at court, that it appears very
plauſible to the Tories. To whom they ſet forth, that in the ſealed act,
as it now ſtands, moſt of the lords of the regency are Whigs, and ſo they
muſt fall into the hands of their enemies, whereas, if the next ſucceſſor is
fixed by a new inſtrument, to be regiſtered in Chancery, decency will
require that, at leaſt, a certain number of Tories ſhould be named with
them. Others ſay, that the nomination will be leſt to the Queen and
parliament. Be that as it will, it is certain, that if the act of regency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
this change, it is in fact annulled, and ſo the ſtrongeſt wall in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the ſucceſſion, thrown down. How all theſe things agree with the
preſent offers is eaſy to judge.</p>
                  <p>I have endeavoured to flatter myſelf into a belief, that the lord trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
acts in this matter uprightly; but can find no reaſons to encourage
me to ſuch a belief. When one conſiders that man's humour and way
of acting, they may think, that perhaps the Jacobite party grows too
ſtrong for him, and that, ſuppoſing the Queen's health re-eſtabliſhed, to
keep that party in awe, and perhaps to get ſomething from France, he
will ſhow them he is not in ſo bad a ſituation, but that he can do without
them, and for ſome time continue his game without being obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
for the one or the other party. All this might be ſuppoſed of this
miniſter, if one did not reflect, that the preſent ſtep is of too much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and that he had not reaſon to be afraid of the propoſals being
really brought to a bearing. Thoſe that think he has been obliged to
this ſtep againſt his will, have a better opinion of the lower houſe than I
have, unleſs the ſtate of the Queen's health is ſo bad, that there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of her being able to come to London; allow me to add, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
that the lord treaſurer will draw, or ſeeks to draw, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
propoſals, are theſe.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, In general to amuſe the people, and to prevent the fall of credit.</p>
                  <p>2dly, To prevent ſome Tories coming into meaſures with the Whigs,
and ſo hinder theſe laſt from making ſome diſagreeable overtures in the
beginning of the ſeſſion; and</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="567" facs="tcp:0950500102:590"/>
3dly, To afford to theſe that pretend to be friends to the ſucceſſion,
yet for private intereſt will not break with the treaſurer, an excuſe for
not meddling, in any thing, in favour of the ſucceſſion; ſo that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
will by this means, gain ſome weeks, during which time he will be
able to bring his forces into order, and may then laugh at every one for
the reſt of the ſeſſion, and undertake, with ſafety, to change the act of
regency.</p>
                  <p>Lord Cowper having underſtood that there was a writ made out, at
the chancellor's office, for the hereditary prince, as duke of Cambridge,
to appear in parliament, employed the clerk who gives out the writs to
the peers, to enquire at the lord chancellor, whether he ſhould bring
the Electoral Prince's writ to the envoy of the Elector's court. The chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
received him in a very angry manner, enquired who had employed
him in that meſſage, reprimanded him ſeverely, and ordered that the
writ ſhould not be delivered out of the office, even though enquired for.
The officers ſent by Mr. Stanhope to the Boulonnoiſe and Flanders are
returned, and report that they found no troops in motion there, only that
nine Iriſh battalions and a regiment of dragoons were advanced from
Lorrain, and in quarters at Douay, Valenciennes, and Heſdin, and that
the officers ſaid openly, that they had orders to be ready to march upon
a minute's warning.</p>
                  <p>After I had ended this letter, I have learned from good authority, that
Mr. Harley's inſtructions bear, to let his Electoral Highneſs know, that a
faction of ill diſpoſed people diſturbed her Majeſty's government, by
raiſing jealouſies and alarms, particularly with regard to the ſucceſſion,
notwithſtanding the act ſettling the ſucceſſion was in full force; that her
Majeſty would however, do all ſhe could, with honour, to make his
Highneſs eaſy as to that matter; but that, if to chagrin her, an invitation
ſhould be propoſed to parliament, ſhe would look upon it as a perſonal
affront. I cannot be ſure of the truth of this information, but as I had
it from good hands, I thought it my duty to communicate it."</p>

ſervant, and to beg the continuation of the honour of your good

I muſt own, in this caſe, naming your name, my lord treaſurer was as
ready as I was to obey any command of your Royal Highneſs's. I could
not have imagined, till I was in England, the heats and animoſities there
is amongſt people even of the ſame principles; and, believe me, Madam,
all the noiſe made about the Pretender is groundleſs; and the Tories are
full as much in your intereſt, or rather more, than the Whigs, though
the latter have of late got up a way of threatening the Tories with the
proteſtant ſucceſſion, as if your Royal Highneſs, or thoſe of your illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious
houſe, who ſhould ſucceed the Queen, were not to reign over the
Tories, as well as the Whigs. I am ſatisfied that your Royal Highneſs
knows Great Britain too well, not to know who are honeſt men, and who
otherwiſe, without the diſtinguiſhing names of Whig and Tory: for I am
ſure you know, what is called Tory, are thoſe which are for the church of
England, which is all or almoſt all the clergy of England; a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority
in the parliament and nation, and almoſt all the landed men in the
kingdom; who ſhould be more deſirous than they to ſecure their religion
and liberty to their poſterity; and you may depend upon it, Madam,
they are all heartily in your intereſt? I need no better proofs, than that
famous book of Steel's, called, The Criſis, which the Whigs cry up ſo
much, and which I think is demonſtration to your Royal Highneſs, that
you have nothing to fear from the Tories. Are they not all ſworn to
your ſucceſſion? Have they not all abjured the Pretender? And is there
one man either in parliament, miniſtry, or any place of truſt, that is not
ſworn to ſupport your ſucceſſion, and to oppoſe the Pretender's? Are
not our laws made ſo ſtrong, that it is high treaſon to do any thing
againſt your ſucceſſion? Can any one pretend to ſuppoſe, that all the
clergy, all the men of the greateſt eſtates in the kingdom, would at once
venture ſoul, and body, and fortune, to be in the intereſt of one, who puts
their religion and liberties in danger? Can any honeſt man pretend to
ſay, that all theſe people would voluntarily engage to be damned, to be
hanged, and to loſe, at once, all their eſtates and liberty, from themſelves
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:0950500102:592"/>
and poſterity? All I could wiſh is, that means could be found out to
quiet people's minds, and that the proteſtant ſucceſſion ſhould not be
more the cry of one party than the other; that it ſhould be (as it is)
eſteemed the good of both parties and of all the kingdom. I flatter myſelf
I have ſome place in your good opinion, elſe I durſt not take the liberty
I do to aſſure you, that I know all the preſent miniſtry is as much, or
more ſincerely in your intereſt than the laſt were. I had a very good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to know it; for when the Queen was lately ſo ill, that people
began to make reflection, if ſhe ſhould have died, and being to be, by
my poſt, as firſt lord of the admiralty, one of the ſeven regents, or lords
juſtices, in caſe of a demiſe, I ſaw ſo entire and ſo ſtrong a reſolution
to adhere to the proteſtant ſucceſſion, that I ſhall never be more in any
doubt about it. Let me beg, Madam, that what I have writ may be
kept to yourſelf, and that you will not ſhow my letter, but burn it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I only mean what I write for your own private information, being you
have always uſed me with that goodneſs, I may ſay kindneſs, that I can't

Queen, by all our relations, is ſo perfectly recovered, that ſhe may live

                  <p>"I Receiv'd ſome time ago the favour of your letter of the 26th of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,
but defer'd anſwering it, til Mr. Cadogan returned from
the Hague with an account of the ſeitation of things and diſpoſition of
people there, ſince her Majeſty's illneſs. I am very glad to find by him,
the republick takes the alarm, and begins to wake out of the lethargy it
has fallen into, ſince the peace at Utrick. It is true, indeed, the
Queen's health growing ſo bad, as in all probability ſhe can never recover
it, and the miniſter's making ſuch open ſteps in favour of the Pretender,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:0950500102:593"/>
as to leave no doubt of their intentions to place him on the throne, has
brought things ſo near a deciſion, that unleſs the ſtates deſign to look on
and ſee us loſt, and conſequently themſelves, they could no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
inactive, or delay entering into ſuch vigorous meaſures, as are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly
neceſſary to ſave us both. The firſt and great mark of their
preſent good diſpoſition, is their ſecret reſolution to ſet out, as ſoon as
poſſible, a ſtrong ſquadron of men of war; for which they have found a
very plauſible pretext, when their preparations are ſo far advanced, as
to oblige them to own it. They have likewiſe, in caſe of her Majeſty's
death, agreed on the moſt proper means for aſſiſting his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
with their troops, and doing every thing that depends on them
for his ſervice, which I omit explaining, ſince you have been particularly
informed of it by Monſieur Bothmar. I ſhall only add, that they have
promiſed to go on with their ſea-preparations, though her Majeſty ſhou'd
continue to languiſh on for ſome weeks longer; for it has been ſhewn
them, our danger would be greateſt in that caſe, for it would give the
miniſters time to concert every thing with France, for bringing in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender,
even whielſt the Queen was alive; therefore, all meaſures to
ſupport the ſucceſſion of his Electoral Highneſs, would prove ineffectual,
unleſs a ſleet was ready to obſtruct the Pretender's paſſage, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
ſuch troops as muſt be ſent to join with the nation, in order to reſiſt
him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cadogan returns this week to the Hague, and intends, in a few
days after, for England; the meeting of the parliament obliging him to
haſten there. He hopes, before he goes, to receive the honour of his
Electoral Highneſs's commands; and our friends in England aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſuch vigorous reſolutions will ſpeedily be taken, as the greatneſs
of the danger requires. I have ſo often acquainted you with my thoughts
on this ſubject, as that makes it unneceſſary to ſay any thing more of it
now. I have received the commiſſion his Electoral Highneſs has been
pleaſed to honour me with. I muſt beg of you to make him my moſt
humble and ſincere acknowledgements, for this new mark of favour and
confidence. I ſhall make the beſt uſe I can of it, for his ſervice, in the
advancing of which I am always ready to hazard both life and fortune.
I conſtantly tranſmit whatever I receive of conſequence from England
to Monſieur Bothmar, that he may comunicat it to the penſioner, at the
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:0950500102:594"/>
ſame time he forwardes it to Hannover. As to what you deſire to know
concerning Dunkerk and the Engliſh troopes on this ſide, Mr. Cadogan
having fully explained it in the laſt paper ſent you by Mr. Bothmar, I
forbear troubling you with repeating it. I muſt deſire you will aſſure
the Electoral Prince of my moſt humble reſpects, and that you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, with truth,</p>

                     <p>"OUR friends having, for a long time, deliberated on the meaſures
they ſhould take for the enſuing parliament, have at laſt agreed,
that their beſt conduct will be to meddle in nothing, and to propoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in parliament. The reaſon they commonly and openly allege is,
to ſhow lord Angleſea, Sir Thomas Hanmer, and men of that character,
who have credit with the High Church party, and pretend to be our
friends, that it is not from a ſpirit of faction they have acted till now, and
they can be quiet, and do not deſire forcibly to aſſume to themſelves
the glory of ſecuring the ſucceſſion, but are ready to aſſign to them, the
Tories, all the honour and all the merit of it, and to promiſe to ſecond
them, at the time, and in the manner they themſelves ſhall preſcribe.</p>
                     <p>Beſides they ſaw, as they told Kreyenberg, that all their efforts would
be ineffectual, unleſs the Elector took ſome deciſive ſtep, on his ſide,
and they were not ſure but he attributed their conduct more to private
than to public views. They would wait, until they heard what Mr.
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:0950500102:595"/>
Harley did at Hannover, and what anſwer was given him, and they
would regulate themſelves accordingly. This reſolution made Kreyen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg
very uneaſy, as he was afraid it proceeded from deſpair, and from
an apprehenſion that they were blamed and abandoned by the Elector.</p>
                     <p>With regard to my lord Angleſea, I can venture to ſay, from my own
knowledge of him, that he is rather for the ſucceſſion, than for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender:
but, at the ſame time, we may depend upon it, that he will do
nothing, but in certain circumſtances, and that he will not break with the
court, unleſs the Elector or the Electoral Prince is here; and that is
the caſe of Sir Thomas Hanmer and of ſeveral others.</p>
                     <p>Lord Notingham urged Angleſea very much, to enter into meaſures
for propoſing an invitation; but he always anſwered, that it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and that it could not be done with propriety, as the Electoral
Prince, in quality of peer, could come over whenever he pleaſed, and
as all the Oxfords in the univerſe could not hinder him."</p>

                     <p>From thence Schutz draws ſeveral arguments for the coming of the

                     <p>"You have been already told, that, of ten who are for us, nine will
accommodate themſelves to the times, and embrace the intereſts of him
who will be the firſt on the ſpot, and who will undoubtedly have the beſt
game and all the hopes of ſucceſs, rather than expoſe themſelves, by
their oppoſition, to a civil war, which appears to them a real and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
evil; whereas, they flatter themſelves, that the government of
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:0950500102:596"/>
the Pretender, whom they look upon as a weak prince, will not be ſuch a
great evil, as a civil war. And we want to flatter ourſelves, when we
imagine, that thoſe who call themſelves our friends, are ſuch heroes, as
that the love of their religion, and their attachment to us, will animate
them ſufficiently to expoſe themſelves willingly to the greateſt dangers,
to maintain the rights of a family, which is diſtant from them, and which
always ſhewed great indifference for the ſucceſſion to the crown of theſe
kingdoms."</p>

                           </gap>r x. p. 303.</note> he expreſſes great impatience to
know what impreſſions his arguments have made at Hannover. "Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I ought to be at perfect eaſe, whatever turn affairs may take now,
as I did not neglect to give you all the neceſſary and ſuitable advices, I
own that I take the thing too much to heart, and find my ſituation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable,
to hear every day thoſe whom you yourſelves acknowledge to
be your beſt friends, complain that you abandon them, and wantonly
neglect our intereſts, notwithſtanding their intreaties and their clear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
to you of the danger to which you are expoſed; when, at
the ſame time, I underſtand, that in ſpite of all my importunities, there is
any heſitation to repreſent to our maſter, what concerns him ſo much to
know.</p>
                     <p>After repeating the complaints of their friends, and their reſolution to
do nothing in parliament, as mentioned in former letters from himſelf and
from Kreyenberg, he writes, for the firſt time, about an affair which
Kreyenberg had mentioned in a letter inſerted above, and which made a
great noiſe thereafter.</p>
                     <p>"Chancellor Harcourt, to whom it was propoſed to ſend to me the writ
of the duke of Cambridge, without his being able to ſuſpect that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
came from me, gave a very bad reception to the perſon who made
the motion to him, and ſtrictly forbad his clerks to bring it to me, or to
give it to thoſe who might call for it, without an expreſs order from him.
You may judge now the reaſons of this prohibition, and whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from himſelf alone. The writ is in his office, in all the forms,
with the great ſeal, and in a more authentic manner than the writ of
other peers, from whence one may judge, that the princes of the blood
uſually had them.</p>
                     <p>I imagine you eaſily conceive the embarraſſment I muſt be in, in regard
to this writ. A great many, knowing that the chancellor has not ſent it
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:0950500102:597"/>
to me, are ſurpriſed I do not aſk it. Now, how can I do ſo, having no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from you? I own however, that this alone would not hinder me,
if I could flatter myſelf, that, after I ſhall receive it and ſend it by
expreſs to Hannover, which I would have done if I had got it, the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral
Prince will immediately ſet out for this country.</p>
                     <p>Two things, he ſaid, hindered him from aſking the writ: he was afraid
that the chancellor would venture to refuſe it; and that the Electoral
Prince, though he got it, would not come over."</p>

ſaid, that ſhe hoped, he would always join her miniſters in all the affairs

lord Cowper was made a peer; but when it was propoſed to bring over

converſations; although they allow that their religion and liberty would
be more ſecure, by holding to the preſent eſtabliſhment; yet they ſlatter
themſelves, that by good laws, both the one and the other may be very
well ſecured. They are not the loweſt claſs of people who reaſon in this
manner. It is but four or five days ago, that lord Guilford, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>Kreyenberg writes, that many of the Whigs would act, and that ſome
of them argued already in the ſame manner, and maintained, that nothing
could juſtify a civil war if they could poſſibly be ſafe without it. They
ſaw, that if the Pretender was once come over, it would be very eaſy to
hinder Holland or Denmark from giving any aſſiſtance: "and, what is
ſtill worſe," continues Kreyenberg, "the Whigs do nothing new; partly
from the want of power, and partly from their chagrin, at ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
neglected and abandoned, and it will not be long before they will
file off, after the reſt; I do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ean, that they will all become Jacobites;
but one will retire to the country, another leave the kingdom perhaps,
and ſo on with the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Till now, the Whigs in general allowed themſelves to be governed by
Devonſhire, Sunderland, Somers, Halifax, Townſhend, Cowper, Oxford,
and lately by Nottingham likewiſe, merely from the opinion they have,
that theſe noblemen act in perfect concert with the Elector, and have
great credit with his Electoral Highneſs: but they begin to perceive,
that matters do not go on as they imagined; and as men ſeldom find out
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:0950500102:600"/>
the true medium in things of this kind, they carry their reaſonings far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than is juſt. The duke of Argyle, ſince he has got a little into the
ſecret of the Whigs, appears to be greatly ſurpriſed, and God knows, if
in the humour he is in now, he will not join the firſt. He dropt ſome
words to me, the other day, which convince me that his blood boils, and
that he is a man who will conſult only his own intereſt."</p>

                     <p>"LORD Halifax entreated me to inform you of what he is reſolved
to do. He has charged thoſe among the Whigs who have
moſt intercourſe with the Tories, to tell them, that for his ſhare, he
would not ſpeak about the ſucceſſion any more in parliament. That they,
the Tories, being out of queſtion, the majority might do with regard to
it, whatever they pleaſed. That he renounced for ever all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which might reſult to him, in caſe the ſucceſſion ſhould take place,
and that they might take all the merit of it to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>He made this declaration, only becauſe he ſaw no other means of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people's eyes, and he has ſome deſign of making it in parliament.
According to his opinion, unleſs the Queen or the Pretender dies ſoon,
you may look upon the ſucceſſion as loſt. The blame, he ſays, cannot
fall upon him, ſince it is certain, that if you had followed, even lately,
his advice, and the advice of all your friends, you would have prevented
that article in the Queen's ſpeech, by which the miniſtry boaſt they have
ſhut the door againſt any of the family who would chooſe to come here.</p>
                     <p>Sir Thomas Hanmer, whom I ſaw yeſterday, told me, that he did not
deſpair yet; but it is certain, that he was duped, by lord Oxford and

Angleſea will not oppoſe the miniſtry, with whom ſome of his friends
tell me he is reconciled. In ſhort, they will not contribute to bring over
any of the family, although they allow it is the only means of putting
the ſucceſſion out of all danger; and the motive of this ſhameful conduct
is an apprehenſion that the Whigs may enter into employments, and all
the protections which the Whigs inceſſantly make to ſhew they renounce
them, appear to them incredible, and not to be truſted."</p>

                     <p>"HOPING that this letter will find you ſafely arrived, I acquit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of my promiſe, to give you an account of the buſineſs of which
you ſpoke to me here. I ſhall begin with the propoſal of the Electoral
Prince's journey to England.</p>
                     <p>The Elector, having known, long ago, that the Queen was averſe
from ſeeing any of his family at her court, heſitated always for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to ſend the Prince, his ſon. However, he would have complied at
length with the importunities of his friends in England, if notice had not
been given to him, that Mr. Harley was charged by the Queen to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
to him, that the ſending the prince or any of the Electoral family,
would diſoblige her highly, and that ſhe would oppoſe their coming.
It is likewiſe eaſy to perceive, that her Majeſty's ſpeech to the parliament
referred to that. The Elector hopes therefore, his friends will conſider,
that theſe circumſtances render this journey impracticable, unleſs he has
a mind to come to an open rupture with the Queen. You and other
friends may judge, Sir, if that would be ſeaſonable; if it would be for
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:0950500102:602"/>
the advantage or diſadvantage of the ſucceſſion; and if affairs at home
and abroad are in a ſituation to juſtify ſuch an extremity.</p>
                     <p>Since it appears then, to be impracticable to bring into the kingdom,
the ſucceſſor, whom the laws deſtine to the throne, it will be the more
neceſſary to ſecure the proteſtant ſucceſſion, by removing the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
The Elector made inſtances for that purpoſe to the Queen, by the
late baron de Grote, who gave a memorial on the ſubject to the lord
treaſurer: he will continue to do ſo; when Mr. Harley arrives, he will
give it to him in writing; and baron de Schutz will have orders to ſpeak
in the ſame ſtyle at your court.</p>
                     <p>His Electoral Highneſs is of opinion likewiſe, that the regency-bill
ſhould not be changed from a pretence of amending it. He will ſhew
Mr. Harley likewiſe, that he is ſatisfied with it, and that he wiſhes it
may be preſerved entire, which baron de Schutz had orders already to
tell to the lord treaſurer and to the reſt of the Queen's miniſters. If there
is any thing elſe to be done, for the greater ſecurity and further eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of the Proteſtant Succeſſion, his Electoral Highneſs reſigns
himſelf to the opinions of his friends, who are the moſt competent judges
for deciding concerning the utility, or neceſſity, as well as practicability
of meaſures for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The Queen's ſpeech gives room to think, that the court intends to
make things, which concern the Proteſtant Succeſſion, the ſubject of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.
It is to be wiſhed, that the reſult may contribute to its firmer
eſtabliſhment, and to be hoped, that there is no intention of making a
law to forbid the Proteſtant Succeſſor to come into the kingdom, during
the life of the Queen. It would be injurious to him to be put thereby,
in ſome meaſure, on the ſame footing with the Pretender.</p>
                     <p>As to the reſt, Sir, you will inform our friends of the good diſpoſition
of this State in favour of the Proteſtant Succeſſion, and of what they
were prepared to do, in caſe the Queen had died, and of what the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
himſelf was reſolved to do. The Queen's recovery does not make
them loſe ſight of theſe things. The Emperor's peace changes a little
the ſtate of affairs; but he will continue in arms for three months yet,
at leaſt, it being impoſſible to conclude the peace finally before that
time. Endeavours will be uſed. in the mean time to bring about an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the Emperor and the States about the barrier, in order
that his Imperial Majeſty may have a good number of troops in the Low
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:0950500102:603"/>
Countries. He always aſſures the Elector, that he has the affair of the
Succeſſion much at heart<note n="†" place="bottom">Yet he liſtened, two months before, to a propoſal made by the Pretender to marry an arch-dutcheſs. He even, in ſome meaſure, recommended his own ſiſter to that prince.</note>, and the King of Pruſſia likewiſe gives the
ſtrongeſt aſſurances to the ſame purpoſe."</p>

billet, on the article of penſions, eſpecially as the anſwer, in that reſpect,
is not ſuch as I could wiſh; for they write to me, that the Elector does
not chooſe at all to enter into that affair, believing that a beginning
might lead him into an expence infinitely above his income, as he has
not ſuch a purſe for things of that kind, as the lord treaſurer. All
the repreſentations which were made to him, on the ſubject, could not

againſt me, that I think in public, and upon theſe occaſions of
conferences, to ſee what yet remains to be done in favour of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
religion. Monſieur Bothmar takes too warmly upon him to juſtify
the Emperor and Roman Catholic princes proceedings; for even count
Sinzendorf himſelf owned to us, that though the Emperor had that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
in the treaty of Riſwick impoſed upon him, yet ſince it was once
received, he would not do any thing to get it aboliſhed; and it has but a
very ill air in the world for a miniſter of the Elector to begin always with
an inſinuation in public, that the Queen had not done enough, that ſhe had
it in her power, and that ſhe ſhould have made France declare in poſitive
words, that they would aboliſh the fourth article of the treaty of Riſwick.
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:0950500102:605"/>
He was anſwered, that if the Emperor would but declare as much on his
ſide, as the French King had done, that article would be as good as aboliſhed.
Nay, Madam, I can aſſure your Royal Highneſs there was not a miniſter
of one proteſtant prince but took up the argument againſt baron Bothmar.
I told him, and repeated it, that the Queen had done, and would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to uſe her moſt preſſing offices, in concert with the States General,
to diſpoſe France to conſent to a plain abolition of that clauſe, in expreſs
words, and hoped the princes of the Empire would do the ſame thing, on
their ſide, with the Emperor, at leaſt to bring his I. M. to declare as much
as France had done. I told baron Bothmar, if we had really at heart the
proſperity and protection of the proteſtant religion, we ſhould look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and not backward (only to find out inſinuations of reproaches
one againſt another); and I muſt, under the liberty your R. H. has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
me, ſay I was extremely ſurpriſed at the diſtinction baron Bothmar
alone affected, in naming the States before the Queen; for all the other
miniſters returned the princes their maſters' thanks, firſt to the Queen,
and then to the States, for the care they expreſſed for the intereſt of the
proteſtant religion in the Empire; but M. Bothmar, which was extremely
wondered at, and taken notice of by all, returned the Elector's thanks
to the States General, as well as the Queen, for their care, &amp;c. and,
throughout his whole ſpeech, never named the Queen, in preference to
the States, but always ſaid the Maritime Powers, as if the Queen and
States were either equal in dignity or power. I could wiſh this way of
explaining himſelf was altered; for others of the Queen's ſervants might
think it neceſſary to take more notice than I ſhall; for moſt ſincerely
it ſhall be always my utmoſt endeavours to keep up a perfect good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
between the Queen's court and yours, which is the only
reaſon I venter to give this information to your R. H. who I know
wiſhes that, on all occaſions, thoſe of your court ſhewed a particular def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

                     <p>"ONE of my intimate friends, who was, about two months laſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn,
with the Chevalier de St. George, arrived here four days
ago. He ſpeaks very favourably of him. That prince ſpoke to him
with great confidence, and did not conceal from him the good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
between him and the Queen. He has news of her frequently
from the Engliſh who come and return for that purpoſe. He reckons
that all the Scots are undoubtedly in his intereſt."</p>
                     <p>His council were in doubt whether the Chevalier ſhould land in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
or in Scotland, in caſe of the Queen's death. He had a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the church of England with him, who officiated to the proteſtant
ſervants in his houſe above his own apartment; and it was thought he
himſelf would not ſcruple to change.</p>
                     <p>"He, the Chevalier," continues Martines, "he himſelf told the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in queſtion what was ſaid to him by a quaker, who was much ſpoke
of ſome time ago, and who came from England to Bar on purpoſe to
ſee him. He ſaid to him, when he entered the room, "Good-day,
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:0950500102:607"/>
James, the ſpirit deſired me to come to thee, to tell thee that thou ſhalt
reign over us, and we all wiſh it. I come to tell thee that, if thou haſt
need of money, we will give thee amongſt us from three to four millions.'
The prince wanted to make him ſome preſent; but he did not chooſe to
take any, and went back directly to England. The prince made him
eat at his own table.</p>
                     <p>The proteſtant clergyman who is with him is brother to one of the
Queen's phyſicians. This phyſician ſends to his brother, from time to
time, news of her Majeſty's health. He ſays that ſhe cannot live long."</p>

we derive our right to ſucceed to the crown. It is certain that the

                     <p>"IT was once very likely I was to have important news to ſend you
to-day, viz. that lord Oxford was without a ſtaff, abandoned by
all the miniſters, and the Queen herſelf, in ſome meaſure, prejudiced
againſt him. He aſked her permiſſion to lay down his office, when, at
the ſame time, he found ſome one to wait on the Queen, and tell her
that if ſhe gave him his diſmiſſion, the whole Tory party would be ruined,
and that ſhe would fall again into the hands of the Whigs. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
appeared ſo terrible to her, that ſhe tried all imaginable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of keeping him, and of reconciling him, two nights ago, with all
her miniſters. If he had fallen, lord Nottingham would be at the head
of the treaſury; as lord Angleſea would approve of him only, of all our
friends.</p>
                     <p>Nothing could be more uſeful to our affairs, than that this reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
ſhould not continue. There is reaſon to fear, that our enemies may
prevail on the Queen to give her conſent to the Pretender's coming here,
in her life-time. Lord Angleſea diſcovered a greater inclination to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himſelf openly for us, during the quarrels of the miniſtry. The
duke of Argyle outdid himſelf in endeavouring to influence him, while
Mr. Hill and Sir Thomas Hanmer did every thing in their power like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
The Archbiſhop of York is to have a conference with lord Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham
tomorrow, at which the duke of Argyle will be preſent. In
ſhort, our friends neglect nothing, and they deſerve that his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhould expreſs his gratitude to them.</p>
                     <p>Be very attentive to the motions of the prince of Wales. I am aſſured
he left Bar-le-Duc.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 325.</note> Lord Oxford ſays, it is in order to go to Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
but he ſaid ſo before, without its being true."</p>
                     <p>Kreyenberg wrote a long letter, of the ſame date, giving an account
of the diviſions among the miniſtry. The treaſurer himſelf told ſeveral
of his friends, that he would reſign, and for that very reaſon, Kreyen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg
did not believe him. He thought the cauſe of their diſpute was, that
they could not agree about the meaſures for bringing in the Pretender (Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingbroke
being warm and precipitate, and Oxford ſlow and dilatory in every
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:0950500102:609"/>
thing, hating to act openly); or that they were jealous who ſhould have
moſt merit with him. Pretenſions to the Queen's favour could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be the cauſe of their quarrel; as they knew ſhe could not live
long. Kreyenberg adds in a poſtſcript:</p>
                     <p>"After writing this letter, I am informed with certainty, that the
Queen, at the ſolicitation of lady Maſham, whom lord Bolingbroke
found means of gaining, had conſented to the diſmiſſion of the lord trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer;
but that, the night before the laſt, there was a reconciliation on
certain conditions. It is more than probable, that this affair will be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with a change of meaſures. The lord chancellor was for Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,
and Mr. Bromley was neuter."</p>
                     <p>Schutz wrote,<note place="margin">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Schutz fils 8. p. 331.</note> on the 30 March,/10 April, that the Whigs employed lord Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham
to tell again to Sir Thomas Hanmer and lord Angleſea, that
they entreated them to concur with them in the affair of the ſucceſſion,
and that they would renounce all their pretenſions to employments, and
do any thing the Tories could aſk of them. They thought a change ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary for the ſafety of the nation, and that the eaſieſt and
moſt acceptable to the Tories would be, to deprive lord Oxford of the
treaſurer's ſtaff, and to make Nottingham, his brother, and Mr. Hill
commiſſioners of the treaſury. Theſe propoſals of the Whigs made no
impreſſion on the Tories. They hated lord Oxford; but they were afraid
his fall would kill the Queen. "That is, in plain Engliſh," ſays Schutz,
"if ſhe chooſe the prince of Wales ſhould come and reign here, he muſt
be received, for fear of putting her out of humour."</p>
                     <p>"Hanmer aſſures me, that our acts are in no danger during this ſeſſion,
and he will not allow that the miniſtry are againſt us, nor for the prince
of Wales."</p>

the company of life-guards to the earl of Dundonald, an avowed Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,
for 10,000 <hi>l.</hi> of which the Queen gave 3000 <hi>l.</hi> The government of
the caſtle of Edinburgh was to be given to a Mr. George Hamilton, an
officer in the Dutch ſervice, who was a ſoldier of fortune, and would not
ſurrender it, from fears of a forfeiture, as the duke of Gordon did, after
the Revolution. Colonels Sydney and Egerton, of the foot guards, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the earls of Leiceſter and Bridgwater, had notice from Gwyn,
the ſecretary at war, that the Queen had no further ſervice for them, and
that a thouſand guineas ſhould be paid to each of them, for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
which they had bought for the ordinary price of 3000 <hi>l.</hi> Colonel
Paget of the guards had the ſame notice; but the price was not yet fixed;
and it was ſaid that lord Windſor and general Lumley, though both
Tories, would loſe their regiments. "The treaſurer proteſts, that he
has no hand in theſe changes, and that theſe things are done without his

others."</p>
                     <p>"Nottingham was to have a final conference, laſt night, with the
archbiſhop of York, Angleſea, and the ſpeaker, to ſee what they intend

                     <p>"I Have been honoured with your letter of the 13th inſt. and with the
letter of the Electreſs. By the advice of friends I behaved in this
manner. I made up to the chancellor, yeſterday, at court, when he
came there, at two o'clock, to preſent the addreſs of the lords, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of him to give me an hour after dinner; on which he anſwered, that
he would not go out that afternoon, and therefore left to my choice, the
hour at which I would chooſe to come.</p>
                     <p>I accordingly waited upon him after five, and told him I had orders to
thank him from the Electreſs, for the aſſurance he had given me, the firſt
time I ſaw him, that he had her intereſts ſo much at heart, and made
other compliments of the ſame kind to him; to which he anſwered as I
could wiſh, proteſting his profound reſpect and duty to her Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
of which he would be happy to give proofs on all occaſions.</p>

the Pretender's coming were but too well founded. They were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with the order which the Electreſs gave me, to demand the writ
for the Electoral Prince; and before I did any thing in that affair, I
aſked the advice of the following perſons, and they were all of the ſame
opinion: Devonſhire, Somerſet, Nottingham, Argyle, Orford, Somers,
Cowper, Halifax, Wharton, and Townſhend.</p>
                     <p>Angleſea being in the country, I could not conſult him before laſt
night, when I ſaw him at Sir Thomas Hanmer's. He ſaid, that you could
not do any thing more to the purpoſe; and that this is the laſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſaving your ſucceſſion; being very ſure, that unleſs you apply a
ſpeedy remedy, it will be too late before the end of ſix months, as every
thing will be then ruined.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, he, as well as all our other friends, conjure the Elector to
ſend over the Prince immediately, although the writ ſhould be refuſed,
as his preſence alone can re eſtabliſh every thing yet; and as every thing
will be loſt after taking ſuch a ſtep, if we go no farther. Sir Thomas
Hanmer is of the ſame opinion, and promiſed, as well as Lord Angleſea,
to employ his influence with all thoſe who depend upon him in the houſe
of commons to make them declare themſelves, aſſuring me he is fully
convinced the court will not be in a condition to hinder them."</p>

                  <p>"THIS laſt poſt, I receiv'd the honour of your letter of the 17th of
April, for which be pleaſed to accept of my moſt humble
thanks.</p>
                  <p>I ſend this letter by an expreſs meſſenger, who is going to Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
with my letters to Hannover; and if you pleaſe, he wil carry any
thing you think fit to write. But that I may anſwer that openeſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you ſo obligingly treat me, I do, in the moſt ſolemn manner, aſſure
you, that, next to the Queen, I am entirely and unalterably devoted to
the intereſts of his Electoral Highneſs of Hannover. This is not only
from the conſcience of my oaths, but out of profound reſpect to the
Elector's great virtues. I may without vanity ſay, that I had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
hand in ſettling the ſucceſſion. I have ever preſerved the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and it is owing to the declarations the Queen has ſo often made in
their favour, that the generality of the people are come to be for that
ſerene houſe.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure, that lady Maſham, the Queen's favourite, is entirely for
their ſucceſſion. I am alſo ſure, that the Queen is ſo; and you may do
me the juſtice to aſſure his Electoral Highneſs, that I am ready to give
him all the proofs of my attachment to his interes, and to ſet in a true
light the ſtate of this country; for it wil be very unfortunate for ſo great
a prince, to be only prince over a party, wich can never laſt long in
England. And let me in confidence tell you, Sir, that there is but one
thing can be any way of prejudice to the ſucceſſion in that family, and
that is the endeavour to bring them, or any of them, over without the
Queen's conſent. Two courts in this country have been ſo fatal, and the
factions are ſo high, that it muſt be very miſchievous both to the Queen
and to that ſerene houſe, to have any ſuch thing enterprized, that may create
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:0950500102:617"/>
a difference between the Queen and that family: that wil change the
diſpute to the crown and the ſucceſſor; whereas now, it is between the
houſe of Hannover and a popiſh Pretender.</p>
                  <p>I wil add but this one word, that I will aſſure you, that upon any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of kindneſs from the houſe of Hannover, I will pawn my life for
it, they ſhall receive moſt eſſential proofs of the Queen's friendſhip; and
I am ſure, that is the beſt confirmation of their ſucceſſion.</p>

copy, and alſo of the letter I wrote to him, Tueſday after ſix o'clock.
You will ſee that they ſuſpect me of having acted without orders; hoping

                  <p>" I was yeſterday morning at the chancellor's, to take the writ; but
he and all his clerks had gone out; ſo that I returned empty handed.
From thence I went to the lord treaſurer's, who drew me aſide and aſked
if I had not the writ. I told him, I had not. He inquired if the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
had not written to me, and I acquainted him how I had miſſed
him. He then ſaid to me, that the Queen was very much ſurpriſed I
had never ſaid any thing to her about it; adding, that ſhe had never been
treated in that manner. I anſwered that my orders having been addreſſed
to the lord chancellor, I went to him; that I was ſurpriſed he did not
warn me of my miſtake, if it was neceſſary to addreſs myſelf to the
Queen, which he might and ſhould have known better than I. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

                     <pb n="595" facs="tcp:0950500102:618"/>
Angleſea and all our friends think, that I have taken the only method
of obtaining the writ; and that it is for that reaſon they inſinuate, that
the Queen complains I did not addreſs myſelf to her, in which caſe they
would have endeavoured to divert the thing, with as much warmth as
they now employ to hinder the coming of the prince; and it is plain that
the embaſſy of lord Paget has no other deſign, eſpecially as he is to ſet
out immediately. There have been, however, great rejoicings over all
the city, ſince it was made public that I had aſked the writ for the prince;
and ſome have no doubts of his coming ſpeedily, as others moſt certainly
fear it. The bells were ringing for ſome days paſt, and healths drunk
to his good journey.</p>
                  <p>The report which our enemies ſpread every where, and which found
credit with a great number, that we were very indifferent about the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
will be conſidered as perfectly true, if, after having demanded
the writ, the Electoral Prince does not come over immediately.</p>
                  <p>I am come again from the chancellor's; although it was but 9 o'clock
in the morning, they aſſured me that it was an hour ſince he went out,
which I conſider as if they had a mind to amuſe me, and not to give me
the writ. The chancellor's letter, however, is poſitive.</p>
                  <p>I was this morning with Mr. Bromley, to expreſs to him my ſurpriſe
at ſeeing by the chancellor's letter, and by the lord treaſurer's diſcourſe
to me yeſterday, that the Queen thought it ſtrange, that I did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
myſelf to her; repeating to him what I had ſaid to lord Oxford,
and entreating him to inform her Majeſty of it, who, I hoped, would
approve of theſe reaſons, and not believe that there was any intention of
failing in the reſpect due to her, or of doing a thing that was diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able."</p>

which the demanding the writ had already produced, and urges with the
greateſt earneſtneſs the ſending over of the prince immediately. "The
court diſpatched, laſt night, an expreſs to Mr. Harley, who no doubt
will do all he can to intimidate our court, and particularly the Electreſs,

ſpeedily. This is the general opinion of all your friends, who deſerve,

                  <p>Lord Angleſea, who was with me for an hour yeſterday, is entirely of

opportunity of preſerving his right. All thoſe who are for him believe

                  <p>"I Am to acknowledge,<note place="margin">Engliſh copy.</note> with the greateſt thankfulneſs, your letter of
the 29th of March, which came ſafe, and has been communicated
where it was proper. All you mention with regard to the peace of Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadt,
agrees entirely with our ſentiments here, and the pains your court
is taking towards bringing the Emperor and the States to an amicable
accommodation, in relation to the Netherlands, together with the hopes
you give us of ſucceſs in that grand affair, is a great encouragement to
all that wiſh well to the houſe of Hannover. There is one paſſage in
yours, where you ſeem to think it is impoſſible for the Pretender to make
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:0950500102:620"/>
any attempt during the Queen's life. In this we are abſolutely of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opinion, for reaſons, as we think, ſo very obvious to thoſe who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
with the leaſt attention the preſent conduct here, that there is no
need of entering into particulars on this head; and this being the ſettled
notion of all your friends here, you will eaſily imagine, into how great a
degree of deſpair we were all thrown by that part of your letter, where
you mention the Elector's reſolution of not ſending the Electoral Prince
without a previous invitation. For it is but a ſmall comfort to us, to ſee
how diligent and careful you are in taking remote precautions abroad,
whilſt we are convinced that the danger is ſo imminent here, that we ſhall
in all probability be totally ruined before any of thoſe ſupports can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
come to our relief. But now I muſt congratulate with you upon
Monſ. le baron de Schutz's laſt orders for demanding the Electoral
Prince's writ of ſummons. This I can aſſure you is thought by every
body, both friends as well as enemies, to be the firſt ſtep that your court
has made, that looks as if you were in earneſt about the ſucceſſion. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more effectual, if it be ſupported by the immediate ſending
the Prince, nor more ſeaſonable than it was at this time; for the Queen
had juſt then given a moſt unkind anſwer, to give it no worſe term, to
an addreſs for the ſupport of the ſucceſſion, and when the houſe of lords
came to conſider of this anſwer, the effect of the Electoral Prince's hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demanded his writ appeared moſt plainly by the behaviour of a great
number of lords upon that occaſion, though that news was not then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
known. Monſ. Schutz will acquaint you with the conſternation
our miniſters were under, upon this occaſion, and the fright the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
was in, leſt it ſhould be thought he had denied the writ. They
are ſo ſenſible that this ſtep, if it be followed by the immediate coming
of the prince, will ſo effectually ruin their deſigns, and tend ſo directly to
the ſecuring the ſucceſſion from all future danger, that you may depend
upon their making uſe of all arts and contrivances imaginable to prevent
his coming. Neither threats nor flattery will be ſpared. They are ſo
intent and ſo bent upon prevailing with you to ſtop the prince, that they
will not rely upon Mr. Harley's dexterity, but have determined to ſend to
you my lord Pagett. You muſt, therefore, prepare to be very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
attacked by way of meſſage; they ſee the ſpirit of the people here
runs ſo high in your favour, that they have no hopes of bringing either
them or parliament up to any thing, that may diſcourage the prince's
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:0950500102:621"/>
coming. They are, therefore, forced to turn all their views towards
you, and are reduced to the miſerable neceſſity of trying whether they
can perſuade your court to betray itſelf. I ſhall trouble you no farther
than only to give you the unanimous opinion of all our friends upon this
occaſion. They are perſuaded that you muſt be convinced by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which this writ was granted, that you have opened a moſt unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
way for the coming of the prince. It is plain, the writ would not
have been granted, could they, by law, have juſtified the refuſing of it; and
the uneaſineſs they expreſſed, both when it was granted and ſince, ſhews
plainly they would not have failed to have attempted ſomething in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
in order to have diſcouraged him from coming, could they have
had the leaſt hopes of carrying it. From this we cannot think, but that
you muſt be ſatisfied that the inclinations of the people here are ſo
ſtrongly in favour of the houſe of Hannover, that the prince may come,
not only with great ſecurity as to his perſon, but alſo that he will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with all the reſpect and honour that is due to him. But if, after
you have raiſed theſe expectations through the whole kingdom to the
higheſt degree by the ſtep you have made, you ſhou'd be prevail'd upon
to abandon the thoughts of ſending the prince, or be perſuaded even to
delay it, ſuch a proceeding will be ſo fatal, that no man can be anſwerable
for the conſequences of it. I cannot conclude this without doing juſtice
to Monſ. le baron Schutz, who has upon this and all other occaſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
himſelf with ſo much zeal and prudence, that he has deſervedly
got the entire eſteem and conſideration of all, both Whigs and Tories,
who are well affected to the houſe of Hannover."</p>

diſſatisfaction; the lord treaſurer having told me yeſterday, that
he never ſaw the Queen in a greater paſſion. All the reaſon he alleges
to me for this is, that ſhe had no notice from me of the demand which I
was to make of the writ, and although he could not deny but the chancellor

                  <p>—"THE reaſon why Monſ. Dalay makes difficulty to go to the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
churches, which other miniſters before him never did,
is, ſince the paſſing the bill of occaſional uniformity, about three years
ago, which only affects thoſe that are in employments of truſt or profit;
ſo that my lord Morpeth, having none, did not lye under thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
Mr. Dalay does. I make a doubt whether that act extends out of
her Majeſty's dominions; but as it is a doubt, I would no more riſque it
than I find Dalay will; and had it not been for Mr. Cadogan, I had not
minded it. But aſking him, juſt after the act paſſed, to go with me to
the French church, to hear a famous preacher here; he told me, he did
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:0950500102:624"/>
not know what I might do,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">month </seg>May.</label> but for him, he was not ſo fond of going to
any church, as to venture the loſs of his employments, which he had not
then quitted: ſo I, having a chaplain of my own, have never thought it
worth venturing to go to a foreign church, but have conſtantly the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
prayers in my family, and ſermons every holiday."</p>
                  <p>"I am aſſured his (lord Paget) errand is, to explain matters, and ſet them
in ſo true a light before you, that no artifice of a faction, or party, for
private views and intereſt, may be able for the future to cauſe any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude
between the Queen and your illuſtrious family. I took the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
at my laſt coming hither, to ſtate that matter plainly to your Royal
Highneſs, who was ſo good as to make me the anſwer I could wiſh, both
in relation to your reſpect for the Queen, and your being of neither
party; and yet I am ſorry to find your miniſter in England has lately
acted as if at leaſt he was governed by the party that is againſt the court,
becauſe the chief amongſt them have not the chief employments at court;
and I am afraid his late behaviour is ſomething reſented, as being very
irregular, and neglectful of that reſpect due to the Queen: for though
by ſtrictneſs of law, I believe a peer may demand his writ of the lord
chancellor, though abſent, yet it is never done; but the lord chancellor
keeps it by him till ſuch time as the abſent peer returns and demands it
himſelf, to ſit in parliament. I know this better than any man, it hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been my caſe under ſeveral lord chancellors, as I have been abroad
ever ſince the firſt year her Majeſty came to the crown, and having often
had leave to take turns into England, the chancellors have always kept
my writ till I came and demanded it to ſit in parliament, which they
immediately were obliged to ſend me; and ſo it would have been with
the duke of Cambridge, whenever he ſhould come into England to ſit in
parliament. Upon his demanding it, the chancellor is obliged by law to
ſend it him immediately. This being ſo, what occaſion had Monſ. Schutz
to go, juſt at this juncture, and to demand it of the lord chancellor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having previouſly acquainted ſome of the Queen's miniſters of ſtate,
or having firſt notified his intentions or orders (if he had them) to do
it to the Queen, by the ſecretary of ſtate, for her Majeſty's approbation,
which he might have been aſſured would not have been denied him, no
more than ſhe did her leave to lord chancellor to deliver the writ, when
he aſked her if he ſhould do it? I muſt own to your Royal Highneſs, I
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:0950500102:625"/>
am very ſorry to ſee ſuch things happen. Let the partys jar as they
pleaſe; but let not any thing happen, by any miniſter of yours, that
may be interpreted as if your illuſtrious family wanted all the confidence
and conſideration imaginable for the Queen; who, I find, by Mr, Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary's
letter, is herſelf a little ſtartled at this way of proceeding of Monſ.
Schutz; and, if you will pardon the liberty I take, I believe nothing
could have a better effect than your and the Elector's diſapproving what
Monſ. Schutz has done in this matter. As I certainly wiſh well to the
proteſtant ſucceſſion in your family, and deſire heartily the peace and
tranquillity of my country, I can't but apprehend for both, if ſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
means is not immediately found out to put matters upon ſuch a
foot as to convince the world, that there is a mutual good underſtanding
between the Queen and your Royal Highneſs's illuſtrious family; and
that you act on both ſides, with the juſt conſideration and confidence
you ought to have for and in one another. Your Royal Highneſs knows
my character and opinion of partys. You know my zeal for your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and, therefore, I hope will excuſe this liberty I take, to beg of you
to conſider ſeriouſly with the Elector your ſon upon ſome expedient to
put matters upon a foot of reciprocal confidence in the Queen and
your illuſtrious houſe. A King or Queen of England muſt govern by
the bulk of their people, and muſt never be tyed to one or t'other party;
which made King William, and all the Kings his predeceſſors, change
from one to the other party, as they had the majority of the nation and
parliament; and any King or Queen who would reign with a party,
againſt the majority of the nation, would have but a moſt uneaſy life;
and God forbid I ſhould live to ſee ever the Queen and her ſucceſſors
ſtruggling to ſupport different parties."</p>
                  <p>"After all the fooliſh and malicious outcry of the danger of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender,
I have aſked the people here, to tell me one thing done in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
or one thing left undone to exclude him, and to ſecure your
ſucceſſion; nay I have deſired them to let me know what was deſired, or
if there could be any thing more done to ſecure the proteſtant ſucceſſion
in your illuſtrious houſe, and if they would tell me, I would engage it
ſhould be done. And upon diſcourſing this matter t'other day with the
penſionary, he ſeemed convinced of the truth of what I told him; and
that there was no juſt grounds for this outcry about the Pretender, and
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:0950500102:626"/>
that nothing could be of a worſe conſequence than the project talked of
by ſome Whigs, of getting the Electoral Prince over, and ſetting him
up for ſucceſſor, in prejudice to your's and the Elector's right. The
penſionary told me upon this, that he would go and talk roundly to that
man, pointing to baron Bothmar, who was then in the Treves-chamber,
when I was in this diſcourſe with the penſionary; and that he would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
tell me, if there was any thing the Baron could propoſe to be
done. He told me, after having talked to Bothmar, that all he had to
oppoſe was, that the Pretender was ſuffered to continue in Lorrain. Your
Royal Highneſs is judge whether the Queen can oblige the duke of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
to ſend him from thence if he won't, and has engaged to France not
to do it; and what we can ſay more to France, when they anſwer us,
that they have punctually executed their treaty, by ſending him out of
France; and yet that article, in our treaty, was looked upon as a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
on the French King; ſince even in the preliminaries, in 1709, they
did not oblige the French King ſo ſtrongly as we had done in our treaty;
being all was ſaid in thoſe preliminaries was, that whereas the Chevalier
St. George had a mind to travel, the French King conſented to it."</p>

                  <p>"I Entreat you to be ſo good as to offer my very humble thanks to the
Elector, for the ſhare he appears to take in my affliction for the
death of my daughter.</p>
                  <p>It is ſo evident, that the Queen's miniſters are determined to place the
Pretender on the throne, that it would be loſing one's time to produce
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:0950500102:629"/>
proofs of it. Their greateſt deſire, and their only view in Mr. Harley's
embaſſy, is to obtain ſome declaration from the Elector, which may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon the nation, and make it believe that your court is ſatisfied
with them. If you have fallen into this ſnare, it will render all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of your friends of no avail; but we rely upon the great prudence of
his Electoral Highneſs.</p>
                  <p>A more proper time for demanding the writ for the Electoral Prince
could not have been choſen; for you ſee how many of the richeſt and
moſt conſiderable among the Tories declare for you, and acknowledge
that they were deceived by the miniſtry, who loſe ſo much ground in
both houſes, that you may depend upon it, they will take care not to
call the ſecond ſeſſion of this parliament, before they have executed their
deſign in favour of the Pretender; for otherwiſe they will run a riſk of
being proſecuted, for having betrayed their country and violated the laws;
and as they cannot juſtify themſelves in that reſpect, it is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that they will expoſe themſelves to the hazard of another ſeſſion;
for if they loſe any more ground, however ſmall, their ruin is certain.</p>
                  <p>Luckily, this ſeſſion is to continue for two months longer, as no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
are yet found; ſo that the Electoral Prince will have time enough
before the end of it, to arrive and take his ſeat in parliament; in which
caſe the balance will incline entirely to your ſide, as it begins to do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
upon the mere rumour of his coming: ſo that you may judge
what effect his preſence would produce. Accordingly our friends write
to me, that, in that caſe, the parliament will not riſe before they have
ſettled a penſion of 40,000<hi>l.</hi> Sterling, for a ſubſiſtence to the prince,
who will have nothing to do but to make his court to the Queen, and
careſs the miniſters, without meddling in any thing.</p>
                  <p>By this remedy the ſucceſſion will be ſecured, without riſk, without
expence, and without war; and likewiſe it is very probable that France,
ſeeing herſelf prevented in that manner, will abandon her deſign of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
the Pretender.</p>
                  <p>In my humble opinion, it would be proper to uſe diſpatch, and that
the prince ſhould ſet out before lord Paget arrives. This journey of the
Prince, attended with the ſucceſs which there is reaſon to expect from
it, cannot fail to give the Elector new influence, and much greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
over all Europe; as he will ſecure to himſelf thereby the crown
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:0950500102:630"/>
of Great Britain, which will attach the Emperor, Holland, and the
court of Pruſſia to him, and render him the arbiter of the differences of
the North. Whereas, if this opportunity is loſt, (which, according to
appearances, will be the laſt), the contrary will happen, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his Electoral Highneſs at other courts will ſuffer conſiderably by
it, eſpecially after the great noiſe which this demand of the writ for the
Electoral Prince makes every where, which leaves no one room to doubt
of his ſetting out ſoon: ſo that if he does not ſet out at all, your friends
in England, who have expoſed themſelves ſo generouſly for your intereſts,
will be abſolutely ruined, and the ſucceſſion in the utmoſt danger, which
cannot fail to be productive of bad conſequences to your court, in all
the other courts of Europe.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſy for your court to conceive of what importance it is, that the
Prince ſhould arrive while the parliament is ſitting, as the reaſon to juſtify
his journey is the right he has to take his ſeat in parliament, and the
writ by which the Queen calls him to it. I hope you will ſend me good
news.</p>
                  <p>I believe Mr. Molineux will be now at your court. I recommend him
to you, as being a man of quality, who has very large poſſeſſions in
Ireland, but principally as a man of parts and of merit, with whoſe good
principles I am well acquainted. I flatter myſelf that he will be well
received by their Highneſſes. I am, &amp;c."</p>

ſucceſſion, and coming alone without troops, the Queen cannot be juſtly
offended."</p>

Majeſty would have a pleaſure in granting whatever they deſired in that

                  <p>It is in reliance on this, that their Electoral Highneſſes take the liberty

to remove to Italy, and the danger which may reſult from his ſtaying
longer in Lorrain, both to her Majeſty's kingdoms and to her royal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and the proteſtant ſucceſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to be more obliged to her Majeſty than their Electoral
Highneſſes are, for the inſtances which ſhe has been already pleaſed to
make for the Pretender's removal. And as the preſent parliament, as

<pb n="609" facs="tcp:0950500102:632"/>
the nation and of the ſucceſſion is connected with it, which is likewiſe
the opinion of their Electoral Highneſſes, they entreat her Majeſty to take
moſt effectual meaſures for attaining ſuch a ſalutary end; and the more
ſo, the Pretender's adherents publiſh, with the utmoſt aſſurance, that he
is preparing to make a deſcent in the North of Great Britain, while the
kingdom is unfurniſhed with a fleet and troops; which is confirmed by
different advices received from perſons who have been lately at Bar-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc,
and have a ſhare of the Pretender's confidence, and who affirm that
he will begin very ſoon to execute his enterpriſe, and that he depends upon
a powerful foreign aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>"Affairs being in ſuch a dangerous ſituation, their Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

family, who would be attentive to ſuch important concerns, and
ſhew her Majeſty, by a fidelity and an inviolable attachment to her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
how much their Electoral Highneſſes are filled with reſpect and
gratitude towards her. The time appears to be now come, when the
ſecurity of their common intereſts cannot be found any longer but in a
reciprocal confidence, and in meaſures taken with perfect concert; and
when their Electoral Highneſſes, as they do not expect the ſecurity of
their rights to the ſucceſſion, but from the continuance of her Majeſty's
goodneſs, are ready to contribute, on their ſide, as much as is in their
power, to defeat the deſigns of thoſe who would chooſe to diſturb the

to form any pretenſions in this reſpect, while the nation was burdened
with the expences of the war; but theſe expences being diſcontinued,
and as every thing ought to be put upon a ſure and ſolid footing by the

been taken. "The Queen," ſays he, "will at laſt reconcile herſelf to
it, and the miniſters, at leaſt the greateſt number of them, will pay
their court to him. Angleſea, Abington, Orrery, and Sir Thomas
Hanmer declared, without being deſired, that before the end of the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
the parliament will make ſuch a ſettlement for him as the Queen
had when ſhe was princeſs."</p>
                     <p>Kreyenberg was convinced that the Queen and miniſtry would agree
to every thing that could be aſked of them, if the prince did not come
over, and would perhaps ſacrifice Bolingbroke, and turn others out of
the miniſtry: but he thought that would be done merely to amuſe the
Elector until the parliament roſe.</p>
                     <p>"The Queen ſent for the archbiſhop of York, and made him the
greateſt proteſtations, founded on conſcience and ſentiments of religion,
that ſhe was ſincerely for the proteſtant ſucceſſion. This prelate cannot
reconcile all this with what he himſelf and every one ſees. She ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all of the coming of the Electoral Prince, but only of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging
manner in which the writ was demanded."</p>
                     <p>"It is confidently ſaid now, and it appears very probable, that lord
Oxford has carried his point with the Queen, and is become prime mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.
It is believed that the affair of the writ contributed not a little to
this; as his lordſhip inſinuated, with great addreſs, that lord Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke's
violent conduct induced the Elector to take that ſtep."</p>
                     <p>In the news which was ſent this poſt in cyphers by Galke to Bothmar,
we have the following paſſages.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Johnſton,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 404.</note> who was formerly ſecretary of ſtate in Scotland,
told l'Hermitage, that the plan was formed for bringing in the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
but that it was communicated only to four perſons. He dined that
day with lord Mar, who married his niece. He ſaid that he would go
in three weeks to Spa; and that, as he paſſed through the Hague, he
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:0950500102:636"/>
would diſcover very important ſecrets to Monſ. de Bothmar. He added,
that the coming of the Electoral Prince would remedy every thing; that
even the miniſters, at leaſt ſome of them, would pay court to him; and
that there was no other remedy for ſaving the nation and the ſucceſſion,
but that it muſt be applied without delay, and before the end of the
parliament."</p>
                     <p>"They give out at court, that it is not the affair of the writ, but the
manner of aſking it, which diſpleaſed the Queen; and for that reaſon
they affect to ſhew a thouſand civilities to Kreyenberg, who has been
two following times invited to dine with the L—d T—r, who is
more than ever in credit with the Queen, and appears diſpoſed to attach
himſelf to the prince, as ſoon as he appears, in order to gain him her
Majeſty's good graces, and to overturn Bolingbroke."</p>

when every thing is at ſtake, and when our ſafety, and the ſecurity of

"One may ſay, that the whole nation expects the prince now with
the utmoſt impatience, and that there is ſuch a general diſpoſition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him well, that the miniſters will be obliged to treat his Highneſs
with the reſpect which is due to him. But if the opportunity is loſt,
this inclination may cool; they will think themſelves neglected, and will
be capable, perhaps, of going from one extreme into another.</p>
                  <p>"Undoubtedly the reaſons for the prince's journey become every day
more ſtrong; you know them, Sir, better than any man; therefore I
ſhall only ſay, that all the Tories, excepting ſuch as are entirely devoted
to the miniſters, wiſh for the Prince's arrival with as much earneſtneſs as
the Whigs; and there is reaſon to fear, that if the reſolution of ſending
him is changed, our new allies, lord Angleſea, the archbiſhop of York,
and the ſpeaker of the houſe of commons, with their friends, will leave
us ſoon: for they declare publickly enough, that the ſucceſſion cannot
be ſecured but by the preſence of the prince; and they inſinuated, that
if he does not come, they will be obliged to take other meaſures.</p>
                  <p>"You would ſee by the Gazettes, that the ſtocks roſe very high ſince
the Prince's journey was ſpoke of; an undoubted ſign of the good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

here will give us immediately a majority in both houſes. The Tories
do not conceal their ſentiments in this reſpect, and they ſay publickly,
that they only wait to ſee the Prince for declaring, againſt the miniſters.</p>
                  <p>"The lord treaſurer and lord Bolingbroke are more exaſperated than
ever againſt one another. The lord treaſurer found means of reconciling
himſelf with lady Maſham, and boaſts that he will very ſoon turn out
lord Bolingbroke, and the lord chancellor; and the treaſurer's friends
begin, by private rumours, to charge theſe two noblemen with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of bringing in the Pretender. In a word, this is a fine opportunity
for bringing over the Prince; and the miniſters being come to an open
rupture with one another, the parliament and the people are impatient
to ſee him arrive, and the partiſans of the Pretender cannot diſguiſe their
apprehenſions of this journey, which they conſider as a mortal blow, to

family, as princes of the blood, by the act of precedency, which was
carried to them two years ago, by Mr. Harley, that court imagined theſe
were real favours, of which they might make uſe when the opportunity
offered, and that the Electoral Prince, when he made uſe of his writ of
ſummons, only made uſe of what was his right, and that, if he went to
England, it would be with an intention to continue inviolably attached
to the Queen and to her miniſters, and to your lordſhip in particular;
wherein her Britannic Majeſty would find her own ſafety and that of her
kingdoms againſt the attempts of the Pretender, who would not dare,
in that caſe, to think of an invaſion. Beſides that, the King of France
would have this reaſon to allege for diſpenſing himſelf from aſſiſting
him, that there would be no means of doing it, as the family of Hanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

their hopes.</p>

Elector's views, and I pray God, with all my heart, that the meaſures

if the Elector abandons us in this manner, and refuſes to embrace

Conſider what advantage the Pretender's friends will draw from it,

propoſed that the parliament ſhould order, the black box to be opened;

The pardon which the Queen granted to Doctor Bedford, author of
the bock on Hereditary Right, is the greateſt affront which her Majeſty
could offer to the Electoral family. I don't know if theſe things are
underſtood at your court, or if attention is paid to them.</p>
                  <p>They continue to diſmiſs all the officers, civil and military, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume

they give out, that the Queen's miniſters aſſure your court that they

the ſucceſſion is loſt. The delaying his journey has had already the bad

                  <p>"THE inexpreſſible impatience Which every one ſhows here, for news
of the Electoral Prince's departure, induces me to, take the liberty
of embracing every ſafe opportunity which offers, of repeating to you,
that every thing is irreparably loſt if the reſolution of ſending him is
changed or delayed; for the earneſt deſire of ſeeing him here, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo univerſal, and augmenting every day, his coming is ſo abſolutely
neceſſary, that I fear a longer delay may produce very diſagreeable effects.</p>
                  <p>As to the Queen, ſhe continues much indiſpoſed: the St. Anthony's
fire [<hi>l'eriſipele</hi>] which broke out in her leg and thigh, has conſiderably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed
the violence of her fever; but it is believed, on, the other hand,
that a mortification may follow. She ſleeps little and eats nothing, and
ſhe is in ſuch dreadful anxiety, that her mind ſuffers no leſs than her body.</p>

The quarrels between the treaſurer and Bolingbroke are greater than
ever. It is true, their common friends reconcile them for a day or
two, but they quarrel more violently afterwards. The partiſans of both
the one and the other give out, that their leader poſſeſſes all the favour
and confidence of the Queen; but it is impoſſible to write any thing poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
on this ſubject, this ſcene at court having lately changed as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
as the wind. The fact is, that theſe two miniſters exert themſelves
very openly, to ruin one another, and as this diviſion among the leaders
reigns alſo among their followers, it is very certain, that if the Electoral
Prince comes over, both of them will be very ſoon overturned; to which
I may add, that at bottom, the treaſurer would not be ſorry that the
Electoral Prince were here, although he is obliged to declare and to
publiſh the contrary, for fear of loſing entirely the Queen, who cannot
hear the prince's journey ſpoke of without putting herſelf in a paſſion,
and the more ſo, that ſhe perceives the nation deſires it with ardour.</p>
                  <p>What I write to you of the real ſentiments of the treaſurer, concerning
this affair, comes from his brother the auditor, who told it to general
Erle, from whom I had it. The treaſurer has likewiſe commanded ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſecret negociations with the Whigs, ſince his credit has begun to
decline at court; and they have anſwered, that in caſe he will conſent to
the coming of the Electoral Prince, and exert himſelf ſeriouſly to ſecure
the ſucceſſion, they will not only forget the paſt, but they will
endeavour to ſupport him and to maintain him in his authority and in
his office.</p>
                  <p>I imagine, Sir, that it is impoſſible to act in a more diſintereſted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than the Whigs do; and I am almoſt perſuaded, that the preſence of
the Electoral Prince will determine the treaſurer to adopt that plan.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall expect, with great impatience to hear from you, and you may
write by the uſual conveyance in the cypher which you gave me. I
make no uſe of it in this letter, becauſe I ſend it by a lady who will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <p>"IT is likely that the chevalier de St. George is preparing for ſome
great deſign which is kept very private. It was believed that he
would drink the waters of Plombiere for three weeks, as is cuſtomary,
and that he would come afterwards, to paſs 15 days at Luneville; but
he changed his meaſures: he did not continue to drink the waters, which
he drank only for 10 days, and came back to Luneville Saturday laſt.
He ſets out to-morrow very early for Bar; lord Galmoy went before
him, and ſet out this morning. Lord Talmo, who came lately from
France, is with him, and ſome ſay, that the duke of Berwick is incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito
in this neighbourhood.</p>
                  <p>The chevalier appears penſive: that, indeed, is his ordinary humour.
Mr. Floyd, who has been theſe five days at the court of his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
told a miſtreſs he has here, that when he leaves her now, he will
take his leave of her, perhaps, for the laſt time. In ſhort, it is certain,
that every thing here ſeems ſufficiently to anounce preparations for a
journey; it is ſaid likewiſe, in private, that the chevalier has had let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that the Queen is very ill.</p>
                  <p>I have done every thing I could to diſcover ſomething of his deſigns.
I ſupped laſt night with ſeveral of his attendants, thinking to learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
but they avoid to explain themſelves. They only ſay, that
the chevalier did not find himſelf the better of drinking the waters, that
he would go now to repoſe himſelf for ſome time, at Bar, until he goes,
in the beginning of next month, to the Prince de Vaudemont's, at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merci,
where their Royal Highneſſes will come likewiſe. They ſay,
they do not know yet, if they will remain in this country or not; that
they will follow the deſtiny of the chevalier; and that it is not known
yet what it ſhall be."</p>

                  <p>"YOUR letters leave me in an uncertainty whether the Electoral
Prince will come or not. Here they begin to believe the laſt. I
made no uſe of the reaſon which you give me, why the Elector has not come
to a determination, that is to ſay, the iſſue of the Queen's ſickneſs, as
they would ſay, it is only a pretence. The Queen's dangerous ſituation,
they would ſay, ought to determine you ſo much the ſooner. In ſhort,
I do not know what to ſay to all this, and I don't believe you expect from
me that I ſhould foretell what may be the conſequence. We muſt wait a
few days to ſee more clearly.</p>
                  <p>All I can ſay at preſent is, that our friends are much dejected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.
Some of them, as Sir Thomas Hanmer and others of his
party, intimate, that as this affair has ſpun out ſo long, and as the court
has had time to recollect itſelf and concert its meaſures, it would be more
proper, in ſuch a ſtate of things, to wait for the next ſeſſion of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to ſee, in the mean time, what can be done. I own I cannot
agree with them in this, and all our other friends likewiſe, as Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Townſhend, Sunderland, Halifax, &amp;c. continue in their old opinion.
But they all in general think, that if the Elector does not chooſe to ſend
the Electoral Prince, it would have been proper and will be proper ſtill
to declare ſo, in order that the Elector on the one hand, may take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of it at this court, and that our friends on the other, may conſider
of ſomething elſe, and of the conduct they are to follow, to keep up the

                     <p>1ſt, Becauſe he is a ſelfiſh and preſumptuous fool, and a fool to ſuch
a degree, that being appointed governor by the Queen in the Indies [he
was governor of Penſylvania], he thought that it was neceſſary for him,
in order to repreſent her Majeſty, to dreſs himſelf as a woman, which he
actually did.</p>
                     <p>2dly, Becauſe the changing lord Paget for this fool Clarendon, having
been brought about without lord Oxford's knowledge, ſhows that Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke
has acquired a ſuperiority, as Kreyenberg writes.</p>
                     <p>Oxford employed Kreyenberg to make me great compliments in return
to thoſe which I made to him by his couſin and by Drummond, aſſuring
me, that he will cultivate a ſincere and true friendſhip with me, if I
chooſe to return it. This is likewiſe a proof to me that he finds himſelf
falling. I ſhall make the moſt obliging anſwers to him, and will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make uſe of him, without giving my confidence to a man ſo
double; perhaps we may draw ſome advantage from him, even though
the other ſhould turn him out."</p>

                  <p>"THE Queen coveting nothing ſo much, as that you may be able to
conciliate a firm and entire friendſhip between her Majeſty and the
houſe of Hannover; I am commanded to acquaint your lordſhip, that
when you ſpeak to the Elector upon her Majeſty's good diſpoſition, you
are to let him underſtand, ſhe hopes it will meet with ſuitable returns.</p>
                  <p>Your lordſhip will endeavor to ſatisfie the Elector, the Queen has no
intention but to ſecure the ſucceſſion to her crowns, as by law eſtabliſhed,
in the houſe of Hannover, and is ready to do every thing that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to that end, conſiſtent with the ſafe and quiet poſſeſſion of them
during her own time.</p>
                  <p>Her Majeſty having been very ſincere in the public declarations ſhe
has made, and in the aſſurances ſhe has frequently given in favour of this
ſucceſſion; ſhe expects from the Elector, he will ſpeak freely on this
ſubject; and particularly, if he thinks he has reaſon to ſuſpect deſigns
are carrying on to diſappoint it, that he will declare what foundation he
has for ſuch ſuſpicion. And your lordſhip will aſſure him, he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
that no perſon ſhall be continued in her Majeſty's ſervice, he has
reaſonable ground to imagine has other views; and if that can be made
appear, her Majeſty will not fail to make examples of ſuch perſons.</p>
                  <p>Upon your lordſhip's arrival at Hannover, you will learn what reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that court has taken about the Electoral Prince (the duke of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge)
coming hither, the demanding the writ for his ſetting in parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
having given an expectation it was ſoon intended. Your lordſhip
will find ſuch reſolution is either taken or ſuſpended; or a reſolution
taken, that he will not come over without her Majeſty's conſent and
invitation.</p>
                  <p>If the reſolution for his coming is taken or ſuſpended, your lordſhip
will repreſent to the Elector, the great uneaſineſs his coming hither, at this
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:0950500102:652"/>
time, will give to the Queen; how unſeaſonable it is, and that it may
endanger the ſucceſſion itſelf.</p>
                  <p>It muſt make the Queen uneaſie, as it will be thought to confirm a
jealouſie, maliciouſly and induſtriouſly ſpread, of her Majeſty's want of
ſincerity and good inclination to the ſucceſſion; and, as it will be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
to gratify thoſe who deſire, and there is cauſe to believe, have ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
his coming over, in oppoſition to her Majeſty; it is unſeaſonable,
becauſe of the diviſions among us, which his preſence, at this juncture,
will rather foment and increaſe, than compoſe and quiet. And it may
endanger the ſucceſſion, as it will certainly cool the zeal of many now
well-affected to it, who, from their duty and regard for the Queen will
be diſguſted with every thing that ſhall have the appearance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous
treatment of her Majeſty; and who will apprehend ſuch a
ſtep to be a declaration of the faction, and entering into the heats and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances
of a party, for whom they have ſo ſtrong an averſion, that
they dread nothing more, than their returning again into power.</p>
                  <p>But if the reſolution is taken, that the duke of Cambridge ſhall not
come without the Queen's conſent and invitation, your lordſhip will let
the Elector know, that this deference and reſpect to her Majeſty will lay
ſuch an obligation on her, as will entitle him to all the good effects he
can expect from it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, your lordſhip will obſerve to the Elector, that a good
uſe may be made of this accident, of this attempt to bring over the duke
of Cambridge, in oppoſition to her Majeſty, ſince the regards he ſhall

                  <p>HE had paid ſeveral viſits, and found none of the miniſters at home
but the lord treaſurer and Mr. Bromley.—"I am juſt returned from
an audience of the Queen. She anſwered me with a very gracious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
I find her paler than formerly, but in other reſpects ſhe looks well,
and ſeems to be in health, excepting that ſhe cannot walk, nor ſtand up.</p>
                  <p>I was told here, that it is not lord Middleton himſelf, but his ſon, who
went to Vienna; and it muſt be certainly for a different purpoſe from
travelling, as he conceals himſelf there in a convent."</p>
                  <p>—6/17 July.—Bromley ſpoke to Bothmar of the publication of the
Queen's letters to the Electreſs and to the Electoral Prince.<note place="margin">Ibid. No. 128.</note>. It was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by ſome that Bothmar publiſhed them, but he convinced them
that he did not. Thoſe who were for the Prince's coming over, were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
at the publication of the letters, as it might produce bad effects
among the people, who would ſee by it, that the Queen had ſo much
averſion from a prince of the ſucceſſion. The miniſtry continued to be
on bad terms.</p>
                  <p>—9/20 July.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>—"It is true the treaſurer receives me very well;
but the queſtion is, if he is ſincere, and if he will ſtill have power to
ſerve us. He deceived the Whigs, and perhaps himſelf. It is thought
he has patched up matters with Bolingbroke. I ſhall write to you about
this by a ſecret addreſs."</p>
                  <p>The letter, which Bothmar promiſed to ſend by a ſecret addreſs, was
written in cyphers; the copy of it which follows, is in Robethon's hand.</p>
                  <p>"It was believed that the examination of the treaty of commerce with
Spain would have given an opportunity of making Bolingbroke fall,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> if
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:0950500102:657"/>
the treaſurer, with his friends, had joined thoſe who wanted to overturn
his antagoniſt. He had promiſed it by his brother, through whom aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
had been given him, that on that condition, they would ſupport
him againſt Bolingbroke. But it ſeems they dared not attack the latter
directly, ſeeing themſelves uncertain of the treaſurer and of his friends,
while Bolingbroke endeavoured to gain lord Angleſea, Lord Abington,
and ſome others to his ſide. At laſt they contented themſelves with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking
only his friend Arthur More; ſo that lord Bolingbroke will
maintain himſelf in his poſt, and may be able to turn out the treaſurer
by his credit with the Queen. The fall of the treaſurer appears to be
very near, according to the opinion of his own friends. Some of thoſe
who would have aſſiſted him to bring down his rival, ſay now, according
to the maxim which prevails much here, that he does not deſerve to be
aſſiſted, as he does not chooſe to aſſiſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons of his conduct in this ſituation of affairs are perhaps,
1. His own humour, which does not allow him to keep himſelf entirely
to one ſide. 2. The hopes of maintaining himſelf ſtill in the Queen's
good graces, by the ſame means, by which he introduced himſelf into
her favour. 3. The hopes of entering again into favour, by degrees,
although he ſhould now loſe his employment, providing he does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
openly againſt the court party. 4. That he is engaged ſo deeply in
certain projects with lord Bolingbroke, that he dares not attack him
openly, for fear of being involved in his ruin; probably, all theſe reaſons
contribute to influence his conduct.</p>
                  <p>He ſeems, however, to reckon upon the good graces of the Elector, and
to be inclined to pay attention to them, which Bolingbroke thinks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
with the ſervice of the Queen; from which one might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
what are his intentions, although they were not otherwiſe known.
We may be ſure he will proceed rapidly, if the direction of affairs falls
into his hands. It is ſaid now, that he wants to continue ſecretary of
ſtate; but that Bromley will be turned out, and Sir William Wyndham
put in his place. That the treaſury will be put in commiſſion. That
lord Angleſea will be the firſt commiſſioner of it, and have alone the
vice-treaſurerſhip of Ireland, which he ſhared till now with lord Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter;
and that Shrewſbury will continue lord lieutenant of Ireland,
from whence they would infer that he will abandon the treaſurer to
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:0950500102:658"/>
unite himſelf with Bolingbroke, although others do not believe this on
account of the irreconcileable difference in their tempers."</p>
                  <p>—July 13/24.—The letter in Bothmar's hand of this date contains
nothing material;<note place="margin">Hannover papers, vol. marked Bothmar x. No. 128.</note> but the copy in Robethon's hand, of what Bothmar
wrote to him in cyphers, contains the following particulars about the
quarrel of the miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>"It is thought that a reconciliation is made by the mediation of their
friends; but that Bolingbroke has always moſt credit with the Queen.
They ſay, that not only the favourite but the dutcheſs of Shrewſbury is
ſecretly for him, by the perſuaſions of her daughter, who is married to
Sir William Wyndham.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two miniſters have been for a long time on bad terms, from
the oppoſition of their tempers and manners. But what gave occaſion to
complete their diffidence of one another and their diſunion, is a project
which had been formed, of dividing in 16 ſhares the profits which the
Queen was to have from the trade to the South-ſea, of which five were
deſigned for the treaſurer, five for Bolingbroke, four for lady Maſham,
and two for Arthur More. The treaſurer having had his reaſons for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
the ſhare deſtined for him, was ſuſpected on that account, and at
laſt became odious to the other ſharers. He afterwards furniſhed their
enemies with means of diſcovering this myſtery, which gave them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to examine the treaty of commerce without producing the effect
which they promiſed themſelves from it, as the treaſurer did not furniſh
them with the aſſiſtance they expected from him, and as the proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the parliament put an end too ſoon to the deliberations on that
affair.</p>
                  <p>The Queen's anſwer to the addreſs of the lords, at which they are ſo
much offended, is aſcribed to Bolingbroke. Lord Angleſea is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
offended, having been the author of the addreſs, to which the Queen
gave that anſwer, and if her Majeſty had not interrupted the debates by
her preſence, matters, according to all appearances, would have been
puſhed very far in the animoſity of all the houſe of peers againſt Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke
and againſt her Majeſty's anſwer. His lordſhip, they affirm, will
be proſecuted vigorouſly in the next ſeſſion; but as he apprehends this
himſelf, it is feared he will bring over the Pretender before that time, to
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:0950500102:659"/>
ſave himſelf and to finiſh his grand ſcheme, from which he expects the
completion of the fortune which his ambition promiſes him.</p>
                  <p>They aſcribe to him likewiſe the Queen's ſpeech; others believe it was
compoſed by the chancellor Harcourt. It diſpleaſes people here in many
paſſages; they are perſuaded that the laſt article reflects on the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Succeſſion, and on the intention of having one of our princes in this
country."</p>
                  <p>—July 16/27.—Bothmar having mentioned the quarrels of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
adds:<note place="margin">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Bothmar, 10. No. 128.</note> "It is ſurpriſing, that the duke of Marlborough comes
over at ſuch a criſis, and does not rather wait until it is ſeen which of the
two competitors will carry it with the Queen; lord Sunderland himſelf
does not comprehend this. I am told he will be the day after to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
at Oſtend, in order to embark there for this country. Cadogan has
been for eight or ten days in the country. He is expected back this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He ſaid when he went away, that the duke of Marlborough
would wait for him at Antwerp. The impetuoſity of the dutcheſs has
probably precipitated this journey."</p>
                  <p>There is a copy in Robethon's hand, of what Bothmar wrote, by this
poſt, in cyphers. He ſays the reconciliation of the miniſtry could not
be durable. Their quarrels continued, and he found it very difficult to
ſpeak with them. His friends diſſuaded him from preſſing them to an
alliance with the Emperor and the King of Pruſſia for quaranteeing the
ſucceſſion, leſt they ſhould afterwards think that the parliament demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it of the Queen, at the inſtigation of the Elector. His friends like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
adviſed him not to aſk, at this time, Engliſh titles for the prince of
the Electoral family, as that might be delayed without any inconveniency
until the next ſeſſion of parliament.</p>
                  <p>"Lord Halifax," continues Bothmar, "thinks that the Elector ſhould
have the title of prince of Wales, and that very little time is neceſſary to
prepare the way for that. They are ſurpriſed that the duke of Marlborough
is in a hurry to come here at this juncture. If he adheres to his old
friends, he will run a riſk with the miniſtry; and if he wants to pleaſe
the latter, he will be abandoned by the former, without gaining much
upon the court. It is thought that the treaſurer has led him into this
ſtep, by the means of Cadogan; and that, at length, he will find himſelf
ſhifted off, as his old friends were, to whom the treaſurer had promiſed
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:0950500102:660"/>
likewiſe by Cadogan,<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> to ſecond them in the affair of the Spaniſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,

                  </p>
                  <p>—July 20/31.—"I ſee by what you tell me of the King of Sweden,
that his return from Turkey will not be ſo ſoon. It ſeems to me, that his
miniſter here flatters himſelf with a real aſſiſtance from this court. I don't
ſee, however, that things are yet diſpoſed for that. It is ſaid he has hopes
from Bolingbroke, and wiſhes the Pretender were here already."</p>
                  <p>—23 July,/3 Auguſt,—"We are ſtill in expectations here of a change in the
miniſtry.<note place="margin">Ibid. No. 130.</note> There are ſome who believe that if the duke of Ormond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
his employments, the duke of Marlborough will have the command

the one nor the other will happen. I imagine your Ker of Kerſland

                  <p>—27 July,/7 Auguſt,—"The duke of Marlborough is not arrived yet.<note place="margin">Ibid. No. 132.</note> It
is probable he wants to remain beyond the ſea, until he knows that there
is a change in the miniſtry. It is certain that the treaſurer will reſign his
employment. I imagine I can write to you this very evening, that he
has actually done ſo. It was ſaid to-day, that Mr. Boyle was to be firſt
commiſſioner of the treaſury, and Mr. Bridges one of his colleagues; but
that neither of them would accept."</p>
                  <p>—30 July,/10 Auguſt,—"I am very curious to know if there is any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for what I write in my poſtſcript to his Electoral Highneſs,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> of a good
underſtanding between the duke of Marlborough and the Pretender.
His Highneſs himſelf can give a great deal of light in this affair, as I am
aſſured, that the lord treaſurer ſhowed him, by his couſin, the originals
of the letters between the duke and the Pretender. This correſpondence
appears to me to be altogether incredible, it being inconſiſtent with all I
ever ſaw or heard of the duke. I refer myſelf to what I wrote about it to
his Electoral Highneſs, and to Mr. de Bernſdorf, entreating you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
me in what manner they conſider this affair. I don't recollect
it was to you or to his Electoral Highneſs himſelf, that I gave an account
of the communication of a letter, by an unknown perſon, to the duke of
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:0950500102:661"/>
Marlborough, of which I ſpeak in the ſame poſtſcript; perhaps, that the
perſon who wrote to him that letter, has alſo forged an anſwer to it.
That letter conſiſts in great reaſoning on the weak ſtate of the Proteſtant
Succeſſion, and on the advantages which the duke might find in embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the part of the Pretender without running any riſk.</p>
                  <p>I imagine they begin to reaſon much in the ſame manner at Vienna,
believing that our party is much weaker here, than it is in reality, and
that we will weaken it by our indifference, and that on that account, they
ought not to offend our competitor, by too much oppoſition to him, who
can the more eaſily mount the throne here, that we are indifferent about
it. I write that it would be proper to undeceive the court of Vienna of
this miſtaken opinion."</p>
                  <p>"P. S. This inſtant, at half an hour after nine, the duke of Grafton
coming from Kenſington, tells me, that all the phyſicians can do to make
the Queen throw up two vomits of antimony, produces no effect either
up or down, and that they believe ſhe will not live out the night. I
have ſo much company in the houſe, that I find it difficult to write
to you."</p>

He ſent the King a letter from the duke of Shrewſbury, who wanted to
be chamberlain, and would reſign his place in the Treaſury and the lord
lieutenancy of Ireland, which Bothmar propoſed firſt ſhould be given to
the duke of Ormond, when the duke of Marlborough got the command

recommends Dr. Hill for the biſhoprick of Ely, the duke of St. Albans
to be captain of the band of gentlemen penſioners, lord Halifax to be

King has been proclaimed very quietly at Edinburgh, and probably will
be ſo likewiſe in Ireland, where ſome propoſe to ſend general Stanhope,
while others think he will be made more uſeful in the Engliſh parliament.
He recommends to deprive lord North and Gray of the government
of Portſmouth, and to give it to general Erle, and to make this change
before the King's arrival. He hopes the houſe of commons will grant the
King for life the ſame civil liſt they gave the Queen, and that the enſuing
parliament will augment it on account of the Prince's family. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a letter to the King, from lord Mancheſter, who had been ambaſſador
in France and at Venice, and ſecretary of ſtate at home, and now
begs only to be made a gentleman of the King's bed-chamber; a favour
which Bothmar recommends to grant to him; but he propoſes that no
anſwer ſhould be given to his lady, who wants to be one of the Princeſs's
maids of honour. He recommends brigadiers Honnywood and Dormer
to be made grooms of the bed-chamber; the laſt having been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the duke of Marlborough. He thinks it will be ſufficient

by the King's acceſſion to the throne of theſe kingdoms; and that
things go on very favourably for his Majeſty. It is reported that they
are arming and preparing tranſports in France. This is not probable;
but preparations are made to guard againſt it, and 15 ſhips will be
ſoon ready. It is ſurpriſing that Mr. Prior ſends no intelligence of theſe
things from France, and that lie writes in cyphers things which he might
very ſafely write plain. Some members of the regency ſuſpect that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are concealed from them.</p>

                     <p>THE archbiſhop of York and Sir Thomas Hanmer recommended Dr.
Hill to Bothmar for the biſhoprick of Ely;<note place="margin">Ibid. No. 1.</note> but lord Townſhend
told him it would be proper to give it at the recommendation of the good
old archbiſhop of Canterbury.—Mr. Cadogan told him, that lord Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland
wanted to be ſecretary of State: in caſe the King chooſes to
gratify him, Bothmar propoſes that Townſhend ſhould be provided in
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:0950500102:667"/>
another place. Lord Wharton and ſeveral other noblemen propoſed to
him to recommend colonel Tirel to the King for one of the grooms of
his Majeſty's bed-chamber. Biſhop Burnet recommends his own ſon;
but Bothmar thinks it would be better to give him ſome employment in
the law. Mr. Santyan wants to be a commiſſioner of the cuſtoms in
England, and Ridpath deſires to be made one in Scotland.</p>
                     <p>The Prince cannot take the title of Prince of Wales, until the King
creates him. The duke of Bolton recommends his brother-in-law, Mr.
Crofts, to be a groom of the bed-chamber. Lord Wincheſter's eldeſt
ſon aſked the ſame favour for himſelf. He is well made, but irregular
in his conduct, and on that account is on bad terms with his father.
Lord Hertford, the duke of Somerſet's eldeſt ſon, wants to be a groom
of the bed-chamber to the King or to the Prince. Townſhend and other
friends recommend lord Lincoln for ſuch a place. Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
himſelf. Bothmar thinks the King ſhould give ſuch a place
to lord Dorſet, to recompenſe him for his journey, and make lord Orford
firſt lord of the Admiralty, "before lord Strafford applies to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued;
and likewiſe to recall that man ſoon from the Hague; that will
pleaſe the Dutch and a great many here. He is not only hated, but
likewiſe deſpiſed by his countrymen, as a vain man, who has not the
ſmalleſt pretenſions to be ſo."</p>
                     <p>The duke of Buckingham requeſted, that his dutcheſs might be made
a maid of honour to the princeſs. "She is handſome, and appears to
me ſit for ſuch a place; but ſhe could not obtain it from the late Queen,
although ſhe was her natural ſiſter. I don't know if it was for that
reaſon ſhe did not chooſe to have her ſo nearher, but preferred rather to
give her a penſion." The duke of Grafton, whoſe mother had married the
Speaker, Sir Thomas Hanmer, deſired likewiſe to be of the King's bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber.
Bothmar gives him a high character, and recommends him.</p>

                  <p>"I Eaſily obſerve here, that thoſe who are called the Tory-party have
very good intelligence from your court, and that you recommend
ſtrongly a proper conduct to them. Three months ago they treated us
as ſeditious on account of the zeal we ſhewed for the ſucceſſion, at a time
when we believed it to be in danger: ſince they ſee it confirmed, they
diſpute to be for us. However, they had the indiſcretion to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Saturday laſt, more than they intended, by their oppoſition to the
act for putting a price on the head of the Pretender. I can aſſure your
Excellency I do not ſay ſo from a ſpirit of party. I ſhall be the firſt to
rejoice to ſee that the King may ſucceed in annihilating parties, and in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying,
without diſtinction, thoſe who are the beſt affected and the moſt
capable. But I own I diſtruſt ſuch a ſudden change, and cannot help
remarking to you, that a great change in offices is neceſſary, in order to
be able to ſay, that you are not governed by a party: for as they are now
given, they are in the hands of the moſt violent of a party, of whom the
moſt moderate had left them.</p>
                  <p>I aſk your Excellency's pardon for the liberty I take. If what I have the
honour to write to you does not appear to you to be reaſonable, you will
have only the trouble of reading it. I own, that after what I obſerved at
Hannover with what I ſee here, I am perſuaded the miniſter who attends
you, directs the conduct which I ſee a certain ſet of men follow, and which,

the news of the Queen's death. It was the firſt, he tells him, of his

misfortune he had to fear in this world. It would have had its full effect
upon him," he ſaid, "if God had not bleſt him with conſtancy enough
to conſider, that not being there upon his own account, he was not his

His credit with the King, his prudence and great abilities will be of

them to ſo faithful a miniſter. I was mightily pleaſed with the King's
letter to the lords juſtices; it was ſo clearly and ſo judiciouſly writ as
gave univerſal ſatisfaction. I wiſh, while the King is at the Hague, he
would concert meaſures with the States to ſecure the navigation of the
Baltic. We find the reputation and intereſt of England loſt and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
in all parts of the world; the Spaniards, the Algerines, and ſeveral
other nations inſult us in the Streights; the Danes and Swedes in the
North; and if Providence had not, in this juncture, called the King to the
throne, our trade had been every where deſtroyed: if, therefore, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
can retrieve our ſinking commerce, he will gain the hearts of all his
people. The Dutch were quite wearied out with the double-dealing and
tricks of this court about their barrier: if the King, by his good offices,
could adjuſt that between the Emperor and the States, it would be a
great glory and happineſs to his Majeſty; they being the moſt uſeful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
both to the King and theſe nations. I did not doubt that the King
would approve what we had done to put a ſtop to the league which was
framing againſt the Emperor in Italy; and I thought nothing could be
more agreeable to the King than the making a ſtrict union between him
and the court of Vienna. The affair of Portugal is fully ſet out in our
letter to his Majeſty; and I will trouble you no further, but to aſſure you
that I am your moſt, &amp;c.</p>

any other expence for the court which you bring along with you,

which exclude ſtrangers from offices and emoluments in this country.
Such a pretenſion would exaſperate; and ſo far from giving any room
to hope for a mitigation of that law hereafter, would ſuggeſt to them to
make it ſtill more ſevere, when they ſaw that we pretended to elude it,
as France eludes treaties.</p>
                     <p>If the King pays out of his finances at Hannover all the court which

the opinions and affections of the nation. It will ſhow his diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
his generoſity, his rectitude and regularity in every thing. The
very propoſal of charging that expence upon the civil liſt, would not only
deprive him of that advantage, and give a quite oppoſite idea of him,
but would likewiſe create great difficulties with the enſuing parliament
about the augmentation of the civil liſt, which, without ſuch an unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable

he wiſhes his place may be given to lord Townſhend, though
Sunderland aſks it. "Lord Bolingbroke makes up Mr. Prior's diſpatch,
which may very well happen to be the laſt. He ſaid formerly, that he
would never ſerve the Elector: he did not believe then, that the time
would ever be when he would be taken at his word." Bothmar incloſed
a letter from lord Mar, and another from lord Bolingbroke, to the
King. Bolingbroke wrote about his diſmiſſion, for the regency had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
him of the ſeals. He deſired to ſpeak to Bothmar the next day,
and probably on the ſame ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Sept. 3d.—Bolingbroke had been with Bothmar.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> He attributed his
diſgrace to the inſinuations of Oxford, whom he ſuſpects of having miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented
him to the King. Oxford endeavours to perſuade the world
that, by his influence with his Majeſty, Bolingbroke was turned out, in
order to create a belief that he will have ſtill the giving away of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

in order thereby to keep lord Powlet in his office of maſter of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;

the preamble to the prince of Wales's patent, which was a very grateful
talk impoſed on me by the lords juſtices. Their Excellencies have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that the lords and others who meet his Majeſty be out of mourning
that day, as alſo their coaches; but all ſervants, except thoſe of the city
magiſtrates, to be in mourning. The ſhortneſs of the time, which
would not be ſufficient for the making of new liveries, occaſioned this
laſt order. The removal of the lord Bolingbroke has put a ſeaſonable
check to an intereſt that was making in many places for members in the
next parliament, and was very much reliſhed by the people, who aſcribed
to him in a great meaſure the decay of trade and public credit. You
will do me a very great honour, if you can find terms ſubmiſſive enough
to make the humble offers of my duty acceptable to his Majeſty. May
God Almighty preſerve his perſon, and continue him for many years the
bleſſing of theſe kingdoms!</p>

               <p>KING James the Second was born, on the fourteenth of October, 1633, about
twelve at night. He went out of London, with his father, the Queen, and
the princeſs Mary, to Dover. He was ſent back to St. James's; prince Charles
only going to York. About Eaſter, the marquis of Hertford was ordered to bring
the duke to him. The marquis had received an order from the parliament not to
carry the duke of York out of town; yet he did. He went with the Palſgrave,
and other lords and gentlemen, to Hull; the King intending to follow the next
day. Sir L. Dyves came, the next day before dinner, and told the governor, that
the King would dine with him. They were on a platform, by the water-ſide.
The governor turned pale. He deſired the duke and company to retire to their
lodgings. The gates were ſhut and the garriſon put in arms. The King came;
and, ſeeing the gates ſhut, aſked to ſpeak with the governor, who excuſed himſelf
from letting him enter, as truſted by the parliament. The King gave reaſons, in
vain. The governor had received advertiſement from York, from William Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray<note n="*" place="bottom">He was, afterwards, created earl of Dyſert.</note>,
one of the King's bed-chamber, as a friend, adviſing him not to let in the
King; who was reſolved, if maſter of the town, to ſecure him and cut off his
head. Nothing was more falſe, yet it had effect on Hotham.</p>
               <p>The King then deſired, that his ſon and the reſt might come out to him. They
were, accordingly, ſent out, one after another. He then went back to Beverly
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:0950500102:684"/>
and York. In Hull, there was a magazine of arms and amunition, for above
twenty thouſand men, and a train ſuitable. The King could not arm a hundred
men. Had he not ſent Sir L. Dyves before, he might, perhaps, have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and would then be maſter of the town, which was affectionate to him; and
the gentry attending were too numerous for Hotham to reſiſt. The ſoldiers of the
garriſon all threw down their arms, being called upon, by ſome of the King's train
without, to do ſo; nor did they take them up again, till their officers, with their
ſwords in hand, forced them. Some vigorous, bold men, that went with the duke
of York, ſhould have been truſted with the deſign, with an order on the reſt to
obey the duke. For it was in their power, ſeveral times after Hotham ordered the
gates to be ſhut, to have ſecured him, or knocked him on the head: Either would
have done the work. Hotham came into the duke's room without any officer with
him, where he had before confined the duke; yet none ſeized the opportunity.
Sir L. Dyves and William Murray, groom of the duke of York's bed-chamber,
were the only ones for ſuch a ſtep; and were reſolved to kill him. But they were
confined, before they could do it, and a guard put upon them; yet they were let
out with the reſt.</p>
               <p>The King wanted money and arms. The Queen ſent captain J. Strahan, with
arms and amunition and officers in the Providence, from Holland; elſe, the King
could not have formed an army. Captain Strahan brought them into the Humber,
where leaſt expected; ſo run a-ground at a place appointed. He went from Brill
to the Humber. The ſignal was not anſwered. He was forced to anchor, when
the tide was ſpent. The parliament ſhip of fifty-four guns came down from Hull
and anchored, with another from Grimſby, near him. They ordered him aboard.
But, commanding one of the King's Ships, he refuſed. He waited till afloat, and
then ſtood towards Hull, till near high-water. He paſſed over a ſand, then but
twelve feet water; and, when paſt it, ran a-ground. The parliament's ſhips
drawing more water, were not able to follow. The Providence drew but eleven
feet and a half water. He got into the other channel, by bearing up with all his
ſails. The parliament's ſhips, trying to follow, ſtuck faſt. Strahan landed at
Powle, ſome miles below Hull, on the ſame ſide of the Humber; and ran his ſhips
aſhore; ſo that it ſerved for a battery to defend itſelf, whilſt the arms were landed,
and the ſeamen and officers were intrenched; ſo that Hull garriſon durſt not attack
them. A convoy was ſent from York. The King would not let the ſhip be burnt,
after the guns were taken out and carried to York. The ſeamen were made
gunners.</p>
               <p>Eſſex's men were poſted in the vale near Keynton.<note place="margin">1642. Oct. 23.</note> The King marched down
the hill to fight them. Ruthen, who had ſerved as major general under the King
of Sweden, and the earl of Brentſord, being ordered to draw up the army, Lindſay
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:0950500102:685"/>
took it ill, and ſaid he would ſerve as colonel; and put himſelf at the head of his
regiment of foot poſted againſt Eſſex. The King's army was above four thouſand
horſe and eight thouſand foot. The rebels were three thouſand ſtronger in foot;
but had not many more horſe, and few cannon. It was three <hi>p. m.</hi> before the King's
army were embattled; when they marched ſlowly, but with great reſolution; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the rebels ſhot, till they came to puſh of the pike. Both ſides retiring, as
if by mutual conſent, back a few paces, ſtruck down their colours and ſtood firm,
till both drew off, when it began to grow dark. The enemy's left wing fled, as
ſoon as charged. They were purſued, without falling on the foot. The enemy's
foot made the King's retire to their cannon; which, playing with ſucceſs, ſtopt
them. Prince Rupert could not ſtop his horſe from purſuing, or make them charge
the foot. Lord Willoughby's gallant behaviour over his father's<note n="*" place="bottom">The earl of Lindſey, who died, ſoon after, of his wounds at Warwick. He was an

with his thigh broke by a muſket-ſhot, and carried him to bs dreſſed. But he was
taken, by ſome ſtraggling horſe, who came in the way. Sir Edmund Verney was
killed and his ſtandard taken. But it was recovered, by the means of Sir James
Smith. Both armies retired to their former poſts; and the King ſent, early next
morning, five hundred horſe, which brought off his own cannon, and ſix of the
enemy's. Sir Faithful Forteſcue had given notice of his intention, ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
There were not full one thouſand, on both ſides, ſlain; as the parſon, who
buried and counted them, ſaid. Lord Aubigny and lieutenant-colonel Monro
were among the number. The earl of Lindſey died of his wounds at Warwick.
About ſixty ſtandards were taken from the rebels. The King marched to Edgert
and Banbury, taking the caſtle; and ſo to Oxford. But it was of fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that he did not march to London; which, in the fright, would not have
coil him a ſtroke.</p>
               <p>Ruthen, the day after the battle, deſired the King to ſend him, with moſt of the
horſe and three thouſand foot to London, where he would get before Eſſex, ſeize
Weſtminſter, drive away the rebel part of the parliament, and maintain it, till the
King came up with the reſt of the army. But this was oppoſed, by the advice of
many of the council. They were afraid that the King ſhould return by conqueſt;
and, ſaid ſo openly. They perſuaded the King to advance ſo ſlowly to London,
that Eſſex got there before him; and the parliament, ready before to fly, took
heart. All the King's old foot were loſt in the ſiege of Glouceſter and battle of
Newbury.</p>

                  <pb n="660" facs="tcp:0950500102:686"/>
The duke of York might have eſcaped from Oxford,<note place="margin">1648. April 20.</note> if Sir George Ratcliff, his
governor, would have ſuffered it, without a poſitive order from the King. He
was carried to London, where the duke of Glouceſter and the princeſs Elizabeth
had been left, when the King went to the North. The earl of Northumberland
was made his governor. All reſpect was uſed to him. George Howard, brother
to the earl of Suffolk, and colonel Joſeph Bampfield<note n="*" place="bottom">His real name was Bamford; an Iriſhman.</note> contrived his eſcape; the
firſt carrying all the meſſages between the duke and Bampfield, which was all he
had to do.</p>
               <p>All things being prepared, the duke of York ſupped, at the uſual hour, about
ſeven, with his brother and ſiſter, and after ſupper all played at hide and ſeek, with
the reſt of the young people of the houſe; having played at it conſtantly every
night for above a fortnight before. The duke uſed to hide himſelf in a place
where they could not find him, for half an hour or more; and then he would
come out to them. To prevent ſuſpicion of his being gone, when he really was,
the duke lockt up a little dog, that uſed to follow him, into his ſiſter's chamber,
to prevent his coming after him, ſlipt down the back ſtairs, went into the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
garden, and ſo into the Park, out of a back door of the ſaid garden, of which
he had a key, where Bampfield ſtaid for him; having a footman with a cloak,
which the duke put on, with a peruke he had ready, and went through Spring-Gardens,
where one Mr. Trip ſtaid with a hackney-coach, which carried them to
Saliſbury-houſe. Here the duke and Bampfield went out of the coach, as if
going in there; and Trip went with the coach into the city, and kept it as long
as he could, at the end of the town. But as ſoon as the coach was gone, they
took boat and landed on the ſame ſide of the river, cloſe to the bridge, and went to
one Loo's, a ſurgeon, where they found Mrs. Murray, who had women's cloaths
ready for him to put on. He was dreſt preſently, and went with Bampfield to
Lion-key, where there ſtayed a four-oared barge for them. They went in it down
the river; the tyde ſerving them.</p>
               <p>But they no ſooner entered the barge than the maſter ſuſpected ſomething;
Bampfield having told him to be there with his barge, and he ſhould bring a friend
with him, not ſaying it ſhould be a woman. He thought ſomething more was
in it, and was ſo frightened, that, as they went down, he did nothing but talked
with them, how impoſſible it was for them to paſs by the Block-houſe at Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,
without being diſcovered; and that they had no other way to get on board
the ſhip that ſtaid for them at the Hope, but to land at Graveſend, and get a pair
of oars to carry them down. When they debated the diſtance, and ſhewed him the
hazard of getting a boat to carry them to the ſhip, he objected, the light of the
moon. He was ſoon ſatisfied fully, that his woman was ſome diſguiſed body of
great quality. For, peeping through a cranny of the door of the barge, where
they then had a candle burning, he ſaw the duke put his leg upon the table and
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:0950500102:687"/>
pluck up his ſtockings, in ſo indecent a manner, as made him conclude what he
had before ſuſpected. This confounded him ſo, as he told them afterwards, that
he hardly knew what he did or ſaid; which they perceiving, thought it beſt to tell
him the truth and truſt him, knowing him to be an honeſt man. So the duke told
him who he was, and aſſured him, that he would take care to provide for him; and,
if it was not ſafe to return to London, to carry him to Holland. The man's mind
was now ſettled. He reſolved to paſs by the Block-houſe, without going aſhore;
and, when they came near the town, he put out the light; let the barge drive down
with the tyde; paſſed undiſcovered by the Block-houſe, and got to the ſhip, a
Dutch pink of ſeventy tons, lying for them, at the upper end of the Hope. She
had been cleared at Graveſend, where Sir Nicholas Armourer, colonel Mayard,
Richard Johnſon, three gentlemen, with each a ſervant, expected them, whom
Bampfield had truſted and ſent before, that, by their help, he might maſter the
veſſel, if need.</p>
               <p>They ſet ſail, at break of day, with a fair wind, and anchored early next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
before Fluſhing, where they ſtaid, expecting the tyde to carry them up to
Middleburg. The maſter, with two of his four hands, went aſhore with the boat
to Fluſhing, intending to be back, by the time the water was high enough to
go to Middleburg. But before he came back, Owen, maſter of the barge, who
came along with the duke, came down, in a great fright to the ſmall cabbin,
telling them that a parliament frigate was coming in to look for them, and would
be with them preſently; and that they muſt get their anchor on board and ſail for
Middleburg. He was poſitive it was a frigate. The two ſeamen would not get
up anchor till the maſter came back. But they were forced by the gentlemen and
ſervants to do it; though they ſaid there was not water for it, and the ſhip would
be loſt. The ſhip proved only a merchantman. The veſſel ſtruck twice or thrice.
But the maſter coming on board, and the tyde ſerving, they got to Middleburg,
before the tyde was ſpent. The duke landed in women's cloaths, ſtaid all night,
went next morning to Dordrecht; and ſent Bampfield, next day, to the Hague,
to acquaint his ſiſter and the prince of Orange of his arrival, and to deſire cloaths.
He was miſſed, in an hour's time, at St. James's. When he was not ſound, on
ſearch, notice was given to Whitehall and general Fairfax.</p>

caſtles being ſurprized and ſeized, by the inſurgents, declared for the King.
Rainſborough ſeeing that they of Deal had been inſtrumental in it, went on board
a ketch to go nearer to the ſhore, the better to ſee what was doing there, and thence
ſent orders to his ſhip to get under fail, and ſtand as near as they could to the

ſhore, in order to batter the town. Accordingly, they worked to get their anchors
on board; and in doing which, in the Conſtant-Reformation, Rainſborough's ſhip,
and heaving out the capſtern, one of the boatſwain's mates, Robert Lindale,
thought it the proper time to execute the reſolution, which he had taken ſome time
before, of doing ſomething to ſerve the King. Having opened himſelf to three
more common ſeamen, whom he had found to be of his principles, he propoſed,
as all Kent had declared for the King, to get ſome of the ſhips to do ſo. They,
now, as heaving the capſtern, began to grumble at the orders received; ſaying,
they had no reaſon to batter Deal, which was full of their wives, children, and
relations, to deſtroy it and them. This working on the men, they ventured
further to ſay, that it would be better to join with them for the King. On cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
one and all, for the King, Lindale told them, he believed that the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and ſome other officers of the ſhip would be againſt it, and they muſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
poſſeſs the gun-room and arm themſelves; and then they might ſeize their
officers and thoſe that would not join them. They did ſo; ſecured their officers,
telling them they would declare for the King; and, as they would not comply,
they put them in the hold, till they let them go aſhore, and ſuch as had a mind to
go with them. The officers were forced to ſubmit. This done, he got under
fail, and, paſſing along the broad-ſide of the next ſhip, told them what they had
done, and bid them ſeize their officers, in like manner, elſe they would ſink
them; and thus, from ſhip to ſhip, till every one had declared for the King.</p>
               <p>Rainſborough, ſeeing his ſhip had got under ſail, and yet not come up to him,
as he ordered, but ſpeaking to one another, went to them with his ketch, and aſked
his own ſhip what they were doing. They told him, he muſt not put his foot in
it, they having declared for the King; but would ſend him his ſervants and ſome
of his officers. They did ſo; and, on his beginning to talk with them to return
to obedience, bid him hold his tongue or they would fire on him. So he went
away in his ketch up the river to acquaint the parliament. The other ſhips turned
out all their commanders, then came aſhore to tell the Kent gentry what they had
done; and to deſire ſome that were ſeamen to come on board and command them,
as Sir William Palmer, captain Bargrave, captain Foy, and others did, and put
in other officers. Before they got out of the Downs, the earl of Warwick came
down in a ketch from the parliament, to get them to return to their duty, and
deſired to come on board of them. They ſent to know firſt what his buſineſs
was. He offered pardon, redreſs of grievances, if they would declare for the
parliament. Their anſwer was, they valued not the promiſes of parliament:
that they had declared for the King, and would be loyal. The earl ſhewed a
letter, by which he had been invited down by ſome. All theſe were ſent to him.
He deſired one of the ſhips, for his better accommodation, to carry him up the
river; promiſing, on his honour, to ſend it back. They let him have the Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,
a ſixth rate, but he did not keep his word.</p>

They then went to Holland, where the duke of York was, to receive the
prince's commands, and arrived at Helveotſluys. The duke went and ſtaid on board
with them, till the prince came by ſea from France. He took the command and
failed for the Downs; leaving the duke in Holland, and having firſt diſcharged
Bampfield, an unquiet, intriguing head, from his brother's ſervice. His tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the ſeamen, and driving on a preſbyterian intereſt, ſo offended the duke,
that he would never take him again into his ſervice, whatever application was
made. Yet he ſupplied him with what he was able, in his condition, till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration.</p>
               <p>The prince, about the end of ſummer, came with the fleet to Helveotſluys.
The earl of Warwick, with the parliament-fleet, followed to the ſame port. The
Dutch would ſuffer no hoſtilities; and Warwick returned. Prince Rupert, who
was made commander of the King's ſhips went with prince Maurice to Ireland,
Portugal, the Streights, and the Weſt Indies, where prince Maurice and ſome
ſhips were loſt. Prince Rupert returned to Europe, in 1653, and landed at Nantz.
The duke of York went to Paris, a few days before his father's murder. The
King came thither, in his way to Ireland, where nothing conſiderable remained
in the rebels hands, but Dublin. But he ſtaid all the ſummer at St. Germains, or
in Jerſey, till the end of September, where he landed on the twenty-ſixth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,
and received an account of the rout near Rathmines. All thoughts of
Ireland were laid aſide; and the two ſhips ſent by the prince of Orange to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
him, were ſent back to Holland. Addreſſes were made there from Scotland,
by one Windram, an honeſt gentleman. The King reſolved to return to Holland
to treat with the Scots. The Queen-mother met him at Beauvois. After ſome
days ſtay, he proceeded to Holland. He agreed with the Scots commiſſioners, and
went to Scotland. The duke of York ſtaid at Jerſey, till the September of 1650.
He went to Paris, by the King's orders, on the ſeventeenth. But he left it on the
fourth of October, and came to Bruſſels on the thirteenth of the ſame month,
where he ſtaid till the middle of December. The prince of Orange died of the
ſmall pox on the ſixth of November; and the princeſs was delivered of a ſon on
the fourteenth, eight days after his death.</p>
               <p>He went to the Hague, and ſtaid till the twelfth of January, 1651, when the
Engliſh ambaſſador was there received; and then went to Breda. But, ſome
days after, he returned to the Hague. In June he was ordered, by the King, to
return to Paris, and follow the Queen-mother's advice. He arrived there in the
end of June. The King landed about the middle of October, at Feſcamp in
Normandie; and coming to Paris, cardinal de Retz brought him a vaſt ſum of
money in his coach, which the King would not receive, not knowing when he
ſhould be able to pay it. The cardinal ſhewed himſelf very affectionate to him.
He propoſed his marriage with the duke of Orleans'a daughter. The King viſited
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:0950500102:690"/>
her often. But ſhe grew cool; being put in the head of marrying the King of
France, and that the Queen-mother would be forced to conſent to it. So the match
was broke off Mademoiſelle, only daughter of the duke of Longueville, by his
firſt wife, ſiſter of the cardinal Soiſſons, was, at the ſame time, propoſed for the
duke of York; the greateſt match, next to Mademoiſelle, in France. But the
court of France would not conſent. The duke went a volunteer in the campaign
of 1652.</p>

Memoire juſtificatif du comte de Melfort,<note place="margin">23.</note> 17 <hi>Mai,</hi> 1694. This paper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of twenty-four pages. Melfort begins with obſerving that he had been in
great favour with Charles, and with James; and that neither the changing his
religion, nor his riſing ſo high in office, had procured him any enemies, "before
the prince of Orange's arrival, which he had always foretold, without being
believed: but that he had drawn upon himſelf hatred, and many enemies, for
the following reaſons, viz. for having adviſed the King to accept of the aſſiſtance
of France, to ſend the prince of Wales into a place of ſafety, and to ſeize the moſt
conſiderable of his enemies before the prince of Orange's arrival."</p>
               <p>When the earl of Sunderland was diſmiſſed, King James's buſineſs with the
court of France was committed to Melfort. He ſays he perſuaded his maſter to
accept of the aſſiſtance of France; and having, by his orders, made the propoſals
to Barillon, he received, for anſwer, that there were no troops now on the coaſt
of France, nor veſſels to tranſport them. This gave great offence to the Engliſh,
particularly to the earl of Middleton, one of the ſecretaries of ſtate. Melfort was
in danger of being aſſaſſinated; ſuch were the prejudices of the people againſt the
French. He was obliged to retire to France, and had their Majeſties orders to
meet the prince of Wales at Dieppe, where the prince would have landed, if he
had been ſent, according to their Majeſties orders, from Portſmouth. Upon
James's arrival at St. Germains, Melfort was made ſecretary of ſtate for England;
and, againſt his will, was obliged to attend his Majeſty to Ireland. He dreaded
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:0950500102:701"/>
lord Tyrconnel's temper and pride. He claims great merit to himſelf, for having
ſaved that kingdom, by his invention of copper currency, and from his other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
and fatigues. He left Ireland, and expoſed himſelf to be ſuſpected of having
been in diſgrace with his maſter; until it was ſeen, that he was employed to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
a particular commiſſion at Rome. But ſtill he ſays, Sir Theophilus Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp
and his lady, who is very intriguing and cunning, continued to do him ill
offices. They thought it impoſſible that he ſhould pardon them; and therefore,
they retained their malice againſt him.</p>
               <p>Melfort was recalled from Rome, where he acquitted himſelf to the ſatisfaction
of the French miniſtry, to act again as ſecretary of ſtate. He carried on the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with England. James's friends increaſed. The King of France was
induced to attempt an invaſion, and communicated his intentions to Melfort
alone. James, from thenceforward, never called to his council five Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
ſervants, with whom he uſed to conſult while Melfort was at Rome. This
ſtep, which Melfort oppoſed, in vain, created him many enemies.</p>
               <p>While Melfort was abſent, Montgomery, whoſe father and grandfather were
great enemies to the crown of Scotland, propoſed to the King and to the Queen,
by his emiſſaries, and particularly by one Jones, to ſeize the government. The
papers, which concern this affair, were delivered up to the miniſtry, though Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery
and Jones maintained the contrary; as Melfort had foretold from Rome,
from his knowledge of the men who were to conduct it. Montgomery, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his hatred to the prince of Orange, having gained credit with two or
three of the King's friends, began again to make propoſals to the King, and to
give him information of ſome men of quality who were in his intereſt. As theſe
men, in whoſe name Montgomery had advanced ſeveral things, were for the prince
of Orange and Whigs at bottom, the King had reaſon to diſtruſt him, and aſk an
explanation. Jones was ſent over by Montgomery; and, when he arrived at St.
Germains, inſtead of ſhewing who theſe men of quality were, the King ſaw that
he had nothing to expect from Montgomery; and the correſpondence was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
until Melfort returned from Rome, except ſome letters which Montgomery
wrote from time to time to Strafford, ſoliciting money. A perſon who was ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
to the King, that he ſuffered the torture with great firmneſs, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any diſcovery, was ſent, in the mean time, by one of the King's loyal ſubjects
from Scotland, to inform him, that Montgomery had declared, at the table of the
marquis of Montroſe, who is the King's great enemy, that he alſo would be his
enemy to his death.</p>
               <p>The correſpondence was interrupted. Jones, at the inſtance of the King's
friends in England, was thrown into the Baſtile. Abbé Renaudot complained,
that Melfort received few letters from England, and furniſhed him with no materials
for his Gazette. He went to ſee Jones in the Baſtile, Jones promiſed to renew
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:0950500102:702"/>
the correſpondence, and, by Renaudot's means, was allowed to make his eſcape.
When he arrived in England, he blamed Melfort for his impriſonment.</p>
               <p>Melfort, in the remaining part of this long memorial, enlarges upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
done to him, by the miſrepreſentations of Montgomery and Jones in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;

hand, and probably a part of one of the letters he wrote, during his embaſſy at
Rome. It is in the following terms: "I ſuppoſe you have heard of the great
doings here, with the <hi>principe Ingleſe,</hi> as they call him (Ruſſel). Here he paſſes
for duke of Bedford. The cardinals and ambaſſadors themſelves make court to
him. His defects are ſupplied by father Coſmo Clark, who is every thing to him,

To ſpeak freely, but with ſecrecy, there are great abuſes in this matter;
this father pretending to every body, by way of ſecret, that he has a ſort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from the King to treat with the Engliſh nobility, who may come hither;
and ſays, that the King has, by Mr. Carryl, writ to this lord, and given him the
title of marquis of Taviſtock. Whether all this be real or ſuppoſed, is not the
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:0950500102:703"/>
queſtion: that is not my buſineſs, &amp;c. But it ſeems very improper, that one who
has no better guard upon his tongue, ſhould be truſted in affairs of conſequence; one
whoſe glory and vanity would make him not only boaſt of what is, but invent what
is not: of the which I'll give you a conſiderable inſtance. At Torre de Specchi, very
lately, he gave himſelf out for a perſon of a great family, and related to the King.
(By the by, he is grandſon to a taylor, and his father was a contemptible advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.)
By this lie, he got a conſiderable preſent of Agnus Deis, finely wrought
and ſet into caſes, from a nun of the houſe of Maſſimi. Mrs. White told me,
this enquiring into his birth being aſked by the ſaid nun if what he ſaid was true.
His keeping company with Proteſtants does not paſs, without giving great ſcandal:
and, if he has any ſuch commiſſion, as pretended, he makes no other uſe of it,
but to ſatisfy his worldly ſatisfactions and appetites; which his habit would not
allow him to do, without this pretext of the royal countenance, he ſays he has<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If you would be informed of him, aſk—, who had, from an eye-witneſs, an

begun at St. Germains, 19th April, 1693, to 28th March, 1695." The ſecond
is, "Entrys of ſome letters of the earl of Middleton's, moſt of them writt

               <p>Theſe letters throw conſiderable light on the intrigues of the times, and every
thing has been extracted from them, that was any ways connected with the general
hiſtory, or with the private conduct and characters of individuals. They are
moſtly allegorical and in cyphers, and are often without a key: but every thing
of importance in them hath been explained by a careful attention to trace the chain
of the correſpondence, and an unwearied application in comparing them with one
another, and in diſcovering the views, connexions, &amp;c. of the ſeveral perſons
concerned. Acceſs to the letters, to which theſe volumes contain anſwers, would
have greatly abridged this labour, but perhaps have brought but few important
facts to light.</p>

which Mr. Nairne's papers extend. But as many of the papers collected by him

it is neceſſary to give a more particular account of them. He himſelf made

ought not to acknowledge the parliament of Scotland, but in a full concluſion with

opinion, that Windram is not to have a refuſal; but that his Majeſty ſhould ſend
his anſwer into Scotland, by deputies of his own, inſtructed as amply towards
their ſatisfaction as will ſtand with a good conſcience, voyd of ſcruples, and
without doing any prejudice, either to his hopes of Montroſe or to his preſent
poſſeſſion in Ireland; and, ſince the Scots have, in a manner, appeared for the
crown Swedeland, methinks it ſhould be of no ill conſequence, that his deputies,
in caſe of diſagreement in the treaty, ſhould provoke them to a deciſion, by an
arbitration of that crown. But I am not ignorant how unlikely any ſuch propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

               </p>
               <p>The following paragraph of this letter is in cyphers. "The Emperor of Ruſſia
hath, you know, baniſhed all Engliſh trade, and the merchants are making up
their packs as faſt as they can. But before they go, I intend to demand of the
Emperor of Muſcow the cuſtom unpaid for the Engliſh goods, ſince they ſubmitted
to the new authority in England; and if the Emperor will comply with the King's
deſire in any thing, it will more probably be in this demand, which is ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
grounded on his Majeſty's right, and which will not coſt the ſaid Emperor
any thing out of his own purſe. This ſhall not ſlacken my endeavours in the reſt
(literally in my inſtructions) but ſhall only be a reſerve.—The duke of Courland,
as his agent at Amſterdam told me, will lend his Majeſty three good ſhips; the
leaſt of twenty-five guns. They are now in theſe parts; but it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
if accepted, until they ſhall be at ſea, for many reaſons. M. Wicford, at
the Hague, will negotiate any thing with the agent who had orders to comply
with the King's deſire therein, that you ſhall intimate. He himſelf has a deſign
to ſend two or three good ſhips to the Eaſt Indies, with the King's commiſſion,
and likewiſe with goods to trade, if his Majeſty thinks fit; paying a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the value of the prizes to him. I only propounded for you to judge of
it as I do the raiſing of a very round ſum, upon the iſlands of Scilly, upon a
treaty to be made with theſe States. Think well of this latter, and whether the
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:0950500102:710"/>
King will be able to defend and relieve them this next ſummer. But, if he might
receive 50,000 <hi>l.</hi> and they be put into the States' hands, as caution only for the
money, whereby they ſhould be defended by them, and poſſibly they thereby inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
engaged in the King's quarrel, it might be no ill bargain."</p>

13/22 1650.</p>
               <p>The letter was ſent by Mr. Wyndram. Charles appoints commiſſioners from
Scotland to meet him at Breda. Along with it was ſent a letter to the clergy of
Scotland.<note place="margin">139.</note> Charles, in theſe letters, promiſed to ſubmit to the conditions which
were propoſed to him, and particularly to acknowledge the convention of eſtates,
then aſſembled in Scotland, to be a parliament. At the ſame time he wrote a letter
to the marquis of Montroſe, aſſuring him, that he would make no conceſſions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with the powers he had given him in his commiſſion; and declaring,
that, though he called them a committee of eſtates, he was determined not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
them to be legally ſo. This letter was intercepted, and was of infinite
prejudice to the King. Abram Cowley, on the 13th of March, writes about it to
ſecretary Long,<note place="margin">140.</note> in the following terms: "No doubt it has done the King a great
deal of hurt; but it is very happy, that it has miſſed of the chief end, for which
I conceive it was publiſhed, which was to hinder the treaty. That danger is now
over; and the only doubt remaining is, whether the treaty will produce an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and I dare ſay, all the world, beſides a few of our nation, believe it ſo
great a madneſs not to agree, that they think it impoſſible to happen."</p>

ſome attempts to trim the ſettlement of Ireland; and ſome neate-handed barbers of
the law may contrive how it muſt be done, if they are back't with force. Yet I
ſhould think there are but two ways; either by commiſſion or by parliament. That
of commiſſion has bin tried and laid aſide: but it may be reaſſumed, and this
thought to be a more favourable conjuncture for it than 1670. To ſhake the
ſettlement by parliament requires more preparation; ſheriffs to favour elections
muſt be named; and the houſe of lords muſt be filled with peers, that will concur.

Proteſtants of the church of England, and have all taken the oaths of allegiance
and ſupremacy, a little before King Charles the Second's death (ſuch being then
turned out as refuſed); and the officers have all produced certificates of their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken the ſacrament, as required by the church of England, upon an order
from the government of this kingdom, about 12 months ſince. And many of the
Iriſh gentlemen of this country openly ſpread abroad reports, and tell the Engliſh

beſt ſubjects; and that, they ſay, is the meaning of the proclamation, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
uſed therein, viz. that the captains are to keep the arms, for the uſe of
the militia, or ſuch other uſes as his Majeſty may have for them. This ſerves to
diſquiet the minds of the common people: but the officers, and all others of better
ſenſe, are ſo well ſatisfied with his Majeſty's gracious and royal opinion, declared
to the advantage of all the church of England principles, that no ſuch idle fear
enters their thoughts; but they wholly rely upon, and acquieſce in, the aſſurances

People's fears of troubles here are very great, eſpecially if the rebel Monmouth
ſhould have any ſucceſs; which diſturbance breeds a great deal of ill blood here
between the Engliſh and the Iriſh; the latter charging this rebellion on the whole
body of the Engliſh, and telling them, that now their turn is come, and that they
will make the Engliſh of this country good ſubjects: and the Engliſh, on ſuch
occaſions, juſtifying themſelves, and telling them, that though this be a rebellion
in England, yet it is only by the worſt of the King's ſubjects there; and that there
are none, but his ſubjects of England, that: appear in the King's ſervice againſt
them; with abundance of other hot diſcourſes of this kind that run about the
country; the Iriſh charging all the Engliſh univerſally, hardly three excepted in
all this country, as devoted to Monmouth, and not fit to be truſted by the King:
which language gives great offence and provocation to ſuch of the Engliſh as hear
it, and adminiſters greater occaſion of jealouſy between the Iriſh and them than
formerly; inſomuch as each ſay they are afraid the others will cut their throats.
And ſome, more fearful or diſaffected than others, ſpeak of ſermons being in many
places preached, by the friars of this country, upon the 5th, 6th, and 7th verſes
of the ninth chapter of Ezekiel; and though I cannot find any ſuch ſermon any
where, by them preached, yet it ſerves to amuſe and diſquiet the ignorant ſort of
people, and to prejudice the little trade that is going about the country; nobody
buying any thing of the countrymen: inſomuch that I have not been able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the ſixth part of my rent in money, and am fain to receive the reſt in beef or
corn, or to go without it.—The moſt apprehenſive of my friends, on this ſide

go live privately in England; and, though I ſee not ſo much cauſe to fear, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of diſturbance, as they pretend to ſee, yet, becauſe they deſired me to
move it to you, I deſire the favour, of your advice about it. It is upon the advice
