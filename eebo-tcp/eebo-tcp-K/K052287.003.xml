            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. STORY of the Hon. Mr. CLINTON.</head>
               <p>THE WORLD, my lovely Couſin, the World is to Man as his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Complexion. The Mind conſtitutes its own Proſperity and Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Winter preſents no Cloud to a chearful
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0237300103:3"/>Spirit, neither can Summer find Sunſhine for the Spirit that is in a State of Dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In my Youth every Object preſented me with Happineſs; but alas, the Time came when the Univerſe appeared as a Vault wherein Joy was entombed, and the Sun himſelf but as a Lamp that ſerved to ſhew the Gloom and the Horrors around me.</p>
               <p>As my Father and Mother died before I was taken from Nurſe, I knew none of thoſe parental Tenderneſſes and Endearments that ſerve to humanize the Soul and give it the firſt Impreſſions of ſocial Attachment; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were thoſe Sweetneſſes in any Degree ſupplied to me by the Behaviour of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Brother or of a magiſterial Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. As I was naturally, however, of a benevolent Caſt, I ſought for thoſe Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Amities among Strangers which I had not found in the Boſoms or Faces of Kin.</p>
               <p>I paſs over the immaterial Parts of my Life at School and College, and haſten to the more important Period of my Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip.</p>
               <p>Your Father bound me to Mr. <hi>Golding,</hi> a very wealthy and eminent Merchant, who lived over againſt the <hi>Exchange.</hi> He had been ſome Years a Widower, and his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0237300103:4"/>only Child, a Daughter, was then at the Boarding-ſchool.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Golding,</hi> with a plain Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was a Man of exceeding Honeſty and a ſuſceptible Heart. At firſt Sight he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a partial Affection for me, whereof he gave me very frequent and very tender Proofs; and, as he ſtood to me in the Place of a Patron and a Father, I felt for him all the Fondneſs and Attachment of a Child.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Year of my Apprenticeſhip he called me to his Cloſet, and, taking me kindly by the Hand, <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays he, I love you, your Intereſt lies near my Heart, for though you are not the begotten of my Body you are the Child of my Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons—be quiet, <hi>Harry</hi>—let me ſpeak—I have to talk to you of Matters of Conſequence.—I went Yeſterday to your Uncle <hi>Goodall</hi> to know how Accounts ſtood between ye—though he is but a cold Kinſman he is a very faithful Guardian—He has juſt married a very lovely young Woman, and I would have you go and pay your Compliments to them on the Occaſion.—Your Uncle has laid out your little Penny to good Advantage, and your 12000<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> is now nearly doubled—And now <hi>Harry,</hi> as your Father did not behave like
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0237300103:5"/>a Father toward you, in the Dividend which he made between you and your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I propoſe in ſome Meaſure to ſupply his Place, and I make you a Preſent of this Note of 12000<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> which added to your little Patrimony may enable you—O, Sir! I cried.—Be quiet, Child, I ſay again, till you find whether or no you ſhall have Reaſon to thank me.—I am growing old, my <hi>Harry,</hi> and by a long Courſe of Induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try have earned a kind of Title to ſome little Reſt; I would therefore gladly make a Compoſition between your Application and my Repoſe. I ſhall not be ſo often in the Counting-Houſe as uſual. I propoſe to take you into immediate Partnerſhip. But as I alſo propoſe that you ſhall be at three fourths of the Trouble, it is but juſt that I ſhould offer you a proportionable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.—Now as my Capital, <hi>Harry,</hi> is more than five times as much as yours of 36000<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> I offer to your Acceptance a full Moiety of all the Profits in Recompence of your extraordinary Attention and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Hear me out—I do not think that I ſhall loſe by this Bargain. The Affairs of <hi>Potiphar</hi> proſpered under the Hands of Young <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and I believe that you, alſo, are a Favourite of your God.</p>
               <p>I could not ſpeak. The good Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my Oppreſſion, and catching me in his Arms, and preſſing me to his Boſom, he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0237300103:6"/>ſhed a ſilent Tear of Satisfaction upon me, and withdrew without ſaying another Word.</p>
               <p>For ſeveral Days following Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> was employed in adviſing his Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that I was now become his Partner and equal in Trade, and I was wearied with Congratulations on my being one of the principal Merchants in <hi>London</hi> before I had attained my twentieth Year.</p>
               <p>The Obligations and Advantages which this good Man thus delighted to heap upon me, incited me to double Application and Sagacity, and all the Eyes of <hi>Argus</hi> were opened within me for ſuperintending and guarding the Intereſts of my Patron.</p>
               <p>I have often thought it ſomewhat ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic that I ſhould win both my Wives by a matter of Adventure, ſo that their Partiality in my Favour ought perhaps to be aſcribed to a Sentiment of Gratitude ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to any liking which they might take to my Perſon.</p>
               <p>On a Day in Summer I rode to <hi>Barnet</hi> to ſettle Accounts with Mr. <hi>Fradgil,</hi> a Correſpondent of my Maſter's, who was ſaid to be indiſpoſed at his Country Seat. As I approached the Town, I obſerved an elderly Gentlewoman walking leiſurely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me, attended by an orderly Train of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0237300103:7"/>young Maidens. I obſerved, at the ſame Time, two Men in gliſtering Apparel who haſtily followed, and, coming quickly up, put all the Females to a Stand, and cauſed them to gather in a Group, as for mutual Defence. One of the Men, however, no way daunted by the Oppoſition of ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous a Company, rudely caught one of the elder Miſſes in his Arms, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly kiſſing her, thruſt his Hand into her Boſom. Mean while the young Lady ſhrieked and cried aloud for Help, when, riding ſuddenly up, I ſtruck the Ruffian to the Ground, with the Heavy End of my Whip. His Companion hereupon drew his Sword and turned upon me, but, puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Horſe at him, I caſt him alſo to the Earth, then alighting, I broke their Swords, and, leaving my Gallants in a Plight not ſuddenly to be dreaded, I led my Horſe by the Bridle till I ſaw my Fair Wards all ſafe to their Dwelling.</p>
               <p>Some Months after this Incident, Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> called me aſide. <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays he, my Daughter is now drawing to Woman's Eſtate, and ſhould learn ſomething more ſubſtantial than Needle-work, and Dancing, and Harpſichords, and frenchified Phraſes. I therefore propoſe to take her Home where, by the Help of our Cook and Houſekeeper, ſhe may be taught how to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0237300103:8"/>make a <hi>Sunday</hi>'s Pudding, and to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Family.</p>
               <p>I regularly go to ſee her, once in every Month, accompanied by ſome Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Acquaintance, but never called you to be of the Party, as we could not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be both from Home.</p>
               <p>My Child, though a plain Girl, is very dutiful and good-natured. Her Fortune, as you are ſenſible, will entitle her to the firſt Lord of the Land; yet, I know not how it is, I would rather that my Girl ſhould be happy than great. I do not wiſh to have her a fine titled Dame. I would rather, I ſay, ſee her married to ſome honeſt and tender-hearted Man, whoſe Love might induce him to domeſticate with her, and to live peaceably and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly within his Family-circle, than to ſee her mated with a Prince of the Blood.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Harry,</hi> as this Affair, of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſits neareſt at my Heart, it is greatly in your Power to oblige me beyond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. On my Daughter's coming home, I conclude we ſhall be beſet by a Number of Courtiers; ſuch an <hi>Argo,</hi> when freighted with ſuch a Fleece, will unqueſtionably be held in Chace by many a Pirate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my Son, I would have you keep a ſharp and inquiſitive Eye about you, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0237300103:9"/>to take good Note, of the Manners and Diſpoſitions of ſuch Suitors as my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall appear to regard. As alſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire minutely into their Circumſtances and Characters. Your Vigilance and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration may ſave us from Ruin. Should my Child be made Unhappy, your Friend muſt be moſt miſerable. But I depend, my dear <hi>Harry,</hi> that while I live you will prove a kind Brother to her; and that you will prove a Father to her in caſe of my Mortality. Here the good Man, no longer able to reſtrain his Paſſion, put his Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief to his Eyes and quitted the Chamber.</p>
               <p>Within a few Days Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> ſet out, accompanied by a Number of his City-Friends, in order to conduct his Daughter Home. On their Arrival, I was deeply engaged in the Counting-houſe, and it was near the Time for Supper before I could attend. As I enter'd, Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to his Daughter, ſaying, this, my Dear, is Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> my Partner, my Friend, my Son, and your Brother. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Miſs <hi>Golding</hi> coloured, and drawing back as I approached to ſalute her, if I am not miſtaken, Sir, ſays ſhe, he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to us than all you have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, it would ill become me to forget that he is the Deliverer of your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—Your Deliverer, my dear <hi>Matty!</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0237300103:10"/>how, where, when?—Why pray, Papa, did Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> never tell you of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture at <hi>Barnet?</hi>—No indeed, my Dear.—It is not every one who would be ſilent, Papa, where ſo much was to be ſaid to their own Honour. I remember that your Knights in Romance, when too modeſt to boaſt of their own Achievements, uſed to permit ſome Friend or Squire to deliver down to Poſterity the Hiſtory of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and I take the Liberty to be Squire to Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> on the like Occaſion.</p>
               <p>Here Miſs <hi>Golding</hi> began to give a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the Matter already recited, but in Terms of high Phraſe and aggravated En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium. While all abaſhed and confuſed, I withdrew, ſaying, that I did not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of any Knights who ſtaid to hear their own Story.</p>
               <p>In Truth I was much ſurpriſed to hear Miſs <hi>Golding</hi> mention the Adventure of <hi>Barnet,</hi> for I did not recollect that I had ever ſeen her, and had taken much more Note of two or three other Miſſes than I had of her.</p>
               <p>Being reſummoned to Supper, Mr. <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> met me as I entered and claſping me in his Arms, O my <hi>Harry,</hi> he cried, how wonderfully gracious has God been to me in ſending my beſt Friend to the Reſcue of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0237300103:11"/>my only Child, in ſending at ſo critical and very fearful a Conjuncture, perhaps the only Perſon who had either Gallantry or Humanity enough to preſerve her. Indeed Sir, I replied, you owe me nothing; I did not even know that the Lady was your Daughter, and I could not pride myſelf, in any Degree, on an Action which I thought incumbent on every Man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>During Supper Miſs <hi>Golding</hi> was very chearful and agreeable. Her Face indeed could not be numbered among the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but her Perſon was Grace and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty though in Miniature, her Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was pleaſing, and when ſhe ſung or touched her Inſtruments, for ſhe was Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of ſeveral, her Mien and Motions were Muſic, each Note ſeemed a Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and we felt her Fingers playing on the Chordage of our Heart.</p>
               <p>For the firſt three Months after Miſs <hi>Golding</hi>'s Arrival, all was crowding and Gaiety, Aſſembly and Feſtival at our Houſe. She was as a Magnet that drew and grouped all the Peerage and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> together. But as Buſineſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be very throng at that Seaſon, I was not at Liberty to partake of their Amuſements, and I reſigned to Mr. <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Commiſſion which he had given
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0237300103:12"/>me reſpecting the Parties who declared themſelves Suitors.</p>
               <p>As thoſe Suitors, in a daily and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Succeſſion, applied to Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> for his Conſent, his general Anſwer was that his Good-liking was inſeparable from that of his only Child, that he would, if they pleaſed, conſult her on the Occaſion, and faithfully report to them her Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or Diſſent. In the like concluſive Manner, when Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> repeatedly queſtioned his Daughter, ſhe would take his Hand between her's and kiſſing it, ſay, O no, my dear Papa, this is not the Man.</p>
               <p>One Day, as I ſat alone in the Counting-Room, Miſs <hi>Golding</hi> entered and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with an Order from her Father for £250. And pray Madam, ſaid I, why this Ceremony, this Matter of Form? ſure Miſs <hi>Golding</hi> may, at any Time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand twenty Times this Sum without any Order ſave her own Intimation.—Indeed! are you ſerious Mr. <hi>Clinton?</hi> I am very proud I aſſure you to have ſo much Credit with you—But, Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> how comes it to paſs that we have ſo little of your Company?—Your Father's Buſineſs, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, deprives me of the Pleaſure I ſhould otherwiſe have in attending you.—Again, Sir, I am quite proud that it is your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to my Father, alone, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0237300103:13"/>your having any Attention for his Daughter—ſo ſaying, ſhe vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>Immediately I was ſtruck with a Glimpſe of ſome uncommon Meaning in the Words and Behaviour of Miſs <hi>Golding,</hi> but as I never had looked toward the Way of her Affections, I paſſed it lightly over as ſome Matter of Whim or Caprice in the Sex.</p>
               <p>Among the brilliant Concourſe of Suitors that frequented our Houſe there was one Mr. <hi>Spelling,</hi> a young Gentleman highly accompliſhed in his Perſon and Manners, and of a moſt amiable Countenance and Diſpoſition. His Father, like Miſs <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>'s, had been a Merchant, and like him too had amaſſed an exceſſive Fortune. As he was modeſt, as I may ſay, to a Degree of Shamefacedneſs, he did not declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Lover, till nearly the whole Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Competitors had been diſcarded. Then, with a bluſhing Diffidence, he avowed his Paſſion to Mr. <hi>Golding,</hi> and earneſtly beſought his Conſent and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in his Favour. You have not only my Conſent, replied the good old Man, you have alſo my beſt Wiſhes, and ſhall have my beſt Endeavours for your Succeſs: However I muſt warn you at the ſame Time, Mr. <hi>Spelling,</hi> that I will not do any Violence to the Inclinations of my Child,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0237300103:14"/>although there are not two in the World whom I would prefer to you.</p>
               <p>I was writing in my Cloſet when Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> came in, with an anxious Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in his Countenance, and told me what paſſed between him and Mr. <hi>Spelling,</hi> and aſked if I did not approve the Match. I do not know Sir, ſaid I, that Man in <hi>England</hi> who is ſo deſerving of your Daughter as Mr. <hi>Spelling.</hi> Then, my dear <hi>Harry,</hi> I have a Commiſſion to give you, <hi>Matilda</hi> has a great Reſpect for your Judgment, I beſeech you to make Uſe of your Influence with her, and to exert all your Oratory in Behalf of this young Man.—But, Sir, will not Miſs <hi>Matilda</hi> look on this as a Matter of high Preſumption in one who has no Manner of Right to adviſe.—No Matter, you may tell her that you did it by my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and that we are both of a Mind with Regard to this Buſineſs.—Well Sir, ſaid I, ſince you are bent upon it, I will obey you, but it is the firſt Time that ever I obeyed you with Reluctance.</p>
               <p>Soon after Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> left me his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entered, with a Countenance viſibly inquiet and confuſed. My Papa, Sir, ſaid ſhe, informs me that you have a Buſineſs of Conſequence to impart to me.—I hope,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0237300103:15"/>Madam, pray be ſeated a Moment.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, my dear Miſs <hi>Golding,</hi> this Office was not of my chuſing, and I hope, I ſay, you will be ſo good as to pardon my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, in Conſideration of my acting by your Father's Command.—You alarm me, Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> pray proceed.—Mr. <hi>Spelling,</hi> Madam, at length has had the Aſſurance to declare his Paſſion for you. Your Father highly approves of Mr. <hi>Spelling</hi> for a Son-in-law; and indeed, Miſs, might I dare to ſpeak my Judgment, I know not where you could chuſe to better Advantage.—If that is the Caſe, Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> I wiſh that I alſo could be of the ſame Opinion—And are you not, Madam? what Objection can you form, what Exception can you have to my Friend <hi>Spelling?</hi>—A very ſimple one, Sir, and no better than this, that he is not the Man who can make me happy.—I am ſorry for it, my dear Miſs <hi>Golding,</hi> I am truly ſorry for it; were I to pick from Mankind, were I to chuſe throughout the World, if any One can deſerve you, it is ſurely this ſame <hi>Spelling</hi>—And yet, Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> I remember to have ſeen the Man who, in every Grace and Merit, is infinitely preferable to your Favourite <hi>Spelling.</hi>—Where, when, my dear Miſs?—When I am brought to the Torture, I may poſſibly be under the neceſſity of confeſſing.—Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, pardon, ſweet Madam! I meant no Offence; and yet I wiſh to Heaven I knew
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0237300103:16"/>— But that you never ſhall know, Mr. <hi>Harry.</hi> — Pray then, Madam, if I may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture on one Queſtion more, has the Party ſo highly favoured any Knowledge of his own Happineſs? — I hope not, Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> but of what Advantage could his Knowledge prove to me I beſeech you? can you ſuppoſe that ſuch a Perſon as I have deſcribed could deign to look with Favour on ſuch a one as I am? — I do not believe, Madam, that the Man is in <hi>England</hi> who would not think himſelf highly honour'd, highly bleſs'd by your Hand. But then are you aſſured, Miſs, that this Man is worthy of it?—Ah, there lies my Misfortune! he is too worthy, too noble, too accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, too lovely, too much every thing for my Wiſhes to leave any thing to my Hopes. And now, Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> that I have entruſted you with my Secret, I hope you will not betray my Confidence and reveal it to my Papa. I rather truſt and requeſt that you will uſe ſome other Colour for reconciling him to my Refuſal of Mr. <hi>Spelling.</hi> And to make you ſome Amends for the Mortification I have given you, by rejecting your Advocation in Behalf of your Friend, I here engage never to marry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your Approbation, though I do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Sir, that you ſhall dictate to my Choice. There is one Thing further, Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> in which you may oblige me, it is to prevail on my Father to diſmiſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0237300103:17"/>theſe Aſſemblies and Revels that peſter our Houſe; indeed, they never were to my Taſte, though, by their Novelty, at firſt they might have helped to amuſe a little Matter of Melancholy that hung upon my Mind, but now they are grown quite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable to me. — Here her Eye began to fill, and, heaving a gentle Sigh, ſhe curt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied and withdrew.</p>
               <p>Immediately my Heart was ſoftened and affected, I ſaw the Child of my Friend and Patron, the one in whom his Hopes and Fortunes and very Life were wrapt up, I ſaw that ſhe was unhappy, that ſhe was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unhappy, at a Time that ſhe had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den me to attempt her Relief, though I would gladly have parted with Half my Fortune to have been enabled to give the Object of her Wiſhes to her Arms.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, my deareſt Madam, it was the fartheſt of all Things from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into my Imagination, that I was the very Perſon who ſat ſo near her Heart. I daily ſaw the lovelieſt Youths and titled Chiefs of the Land attendant on her Words and Smiles, and humbly ſuing for her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. I ſaw alſo that her immenſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and rare Attractions juſtly entitled her to their Homage, and I was neither vain enough nor baſe enough to attempt a Competition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0237300103:18"/>
As in myſelf I was wholly devoid of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I had neither Eyes nor Apprehenſion for the Diſcernment of hers. Though I had often ſeen, I ſeldom had any Kind of Converſe with her, and where the Head is engaged and in a Manner abſorbed by Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there is neither Leiſure nor Room for Love to enter the Heart. On the other Hand, a Perſon affected can inſtantly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the Boſom of the Party beloved, and there diſcern a vacant and inſenſible Heart as legibly as a Prieſt of <hi>Iſis</hi> could decypher Hieroglyphics.</p>
               <p>One Day, as I happened to paſs near her Antichamber, I heard the warble, as I thought, of diſtant and aetherial Muſic. I approached tow'rd the Sound, the Door was on the jar, and, gently opening it, I enter'd and ſtood behind her unperceived. She ſat and ſang to her Lute. The Words were <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s, but ſweetly ſet by her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They expreſs'd that Paſſage in his Play of Twelfth Night, where it is ſaid of <hi>Viola, She never told her Love, but let Concealment, like a Worm i'th' Bud, feed on her damaſk Cheek, &amp;c.</hi> Ah, how affectingly did her Inſtrument anſwer to her Voice, while ſhe gently tuned her Sighs to the ſoft and melancholy Cadences. My Breaſt was ſo ſwelled by a Mixture of Anguiſh and Compaſſion that I could no longer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0237300103:19"/>wholly ſuppreſs a riſing Groan. Hereat ſhe ſtarted and turned, and riſing ſuddenly, her Eyes ſhot Fire, and her Face glowed with Indignation and Reſentment. But, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tears that ſtill trickled down my Cheeks, her Countenance was as ſuddenly changed into Kindneſs, and ſhe caſt upon me a Look of inexpreſſible Complacence.</p>
               <p>Ah, Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays ſhe, I ſee, I ſee that you have a gentle and a kindred Kind of Heart, and that, if ever you happen to love, you will love with great Tenderneſs. — Have you ever loved, Mr. <hi>Harry?</hi> — Indeed, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I cannot ſay, my Commerce has been very little among the Ladies. If I met Love on my Way, or even found it in my Heart, perhaps I ſhould not rightly know what to make of it. But, my <hi>Matilda,</hi> my charming Siſter, (your Father has ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured me with the Privilege of calling you by that dear that tender Name) why will you not entruſt your beſt your trueſt Friend with the Secret of your Diſquiet? whoever the Object of your Eſteem may be, I here ſolemnly engage, at the Riſque of my Life and the Loſs of my Fortune, to bring him voluntarily to pay his Vows at your Feet. O, my Siſter, I would to Heaven that he had now been preſent, as I have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to have his Soul melted and minted as mine has been; his Heart muſt have been harder than the Stones of <hi>Thebes,</hi> if you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0237300103:20"/>did not attract it and move it, at pleaſure, by the Touch of thoſe Fingers and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchment of thoſe Accents. — Ah, you Flatterer, ſhe cried, with a Voice tuned to Harmony, and a Face form'd of Smiles, you almoſt tempt me to tell you what, for the World, I would not wiſh that any one in the World ſhould know. But, I muſt ſnatch myſelf from the Danger. — So ſaying, and caſting at me a vaniſhing Glance, ſhe was out of ſight in a twinkling.</p>
               <p>As our Suitors had now been diſmiſſed and our Aſſemblies diſcontinued, Miſs <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſeem'd quite pleas'd with our Family-abridgment; it gave us frequent Occaſions of being together; I endeavoured, by a Variety of tender Offices and little Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to diſpell or divert the Melancholy under which I thought ſhe laboured; I was greatly ſurprized at my own Succeſs on this Occaſion; her Chearfulneſs return'd; ſhe diſcovered new and ſtriking Graces in her Manners and Converſation, and in a little Time did not appear to want any Conſolation.</p>
               <p>One Day, being on the <hi>Exchange,</hi> I was accoſted by a <hi>Jew,</hi> who told me that he wanted a Sum of Money and would either ſell or pawn to me a Jewel of great Price. It was a Solitaire compoſed of Oriental Pearls, with a Diamond of the firſt Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0237300103:21"/>and Magnitude in the Centre: After ſome chaffering, we agreed for three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pieces, and I put it into my Pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book. As my Buſineſs detained me on the <hi>Exchange</hi> till it was late, I dined with two or three Acquaintance at the Chop-Houſe and did not return till the Evening was advanced.</p>
               <p>On my entering, I was told that Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> was abroad, and that Miſs <hi>Matilda</hi> had juſt ordered Coffee for ſome Ladies in her Dreſſing-room. Immediatly I ran up and opened the Door without Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but was inſtantly ſtruck with the Look which ſhe turned tow'rd me, a Look that at once intimated Dejection and Diſguſt. During Coffee, I endeavoured to behave with my uſual Unconcern, but found it impoſſible to avoid ſharing in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint under which Miſs <hi>Matilda</hi> moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently laboured; in ſhort, a gloomy Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſpread through the whole Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I believe no two Perſons in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were rightly ſatisfied with each other.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Cups were removed, the fair Viſitants got up; and, as Miſs <hi>Golding</hi> preſſed them to ſtay, in a Manner that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denoted her Deſire of their Abſence; they feigned a further Engagement, and very formally took their Leaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0237300103:22"/>
When ſhe had ſeen them to the Door, and that I had handed them into their Carriages, ſhe turned without ſpeaking to me and withdrew toward her own Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I followed, and, as ſhe was about to enter, my <hi>Matilda,</hi> my Siſter, ſaid I, with a Voice of cordial Tenderneſs, do your <hi>Harry</hi> the Favour to accept this Trifle, as an Inſtance of my Regard for the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my Friend, for the deareſt Object, upon Earth, of my Eſteem and Affection. So ſaying I preſented her with my recent Purchace; ſhe did not, however, even deign to look at it; but, ſurveying me from Head to Foot with an Eye of ſtrange Paſſions, ſhe took it and daſhed it againſt the Floor, and, ruſhing into her Chamber, ſhe ſhut to the Door upon me, without ſpeaking a Word.</p>
               <p>I ſtood in an inconceivable Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Concern. In vain I ſearched and reſearched my Memory for the Recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome Inſtance wherein I might have offended her; but, not preſuming to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon her in order to queſtion or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with her, I retreated to my Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the deepeſt Dejection of Spirits.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> did not return till it was late in the Evening. He immediatly ſent for me. <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays he, what is the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0237300103:23"/>has any Thing happened amiſs? I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw you look ſo diſcompoſed. Indeed, Sir, I am not as well as I could wiſh. Bleſs me, we had better ſend for a Doctor. No, Sir, I am in Hopes it will ſoon be over.—Where is <hi>Matilda?</hi>—In her Chamber, Sir, I believe.—He then called Mrs. <hi>Suſan,</hi> and bid her tell <hi>Matilda</hi> that he deſired to ſpeak with her, but ſhe anſwered that her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs was gone to Bed indiſpoſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that ſhe might not be diſturbed.</p>
               <p>Supper being ſerved up, we ſat down in Silence, and as neither of us offered to taſte a Bit, I roſe, wiſhed Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> a good Night, and retired to my Chamber.</p>
               <p>After a ſleepleſs Night, my Servant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a viſible Alarm, and told me that Miſs <hi>Golding</hi> was extremely ill, and that almoſt all the Phyſicians in <hi>London</hi> had been ſent for.</p>
               <p>Very unhappy were many ſucceeding Days. I ſaw my Friend, my Father, the Man I loved above the World, I ſaw him in a Depth of Diſtreſs that bordered on Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and I found my Heart wrung with inexpreſſible Anguiſh.</p>
               <p>Though I was conſtant in my Enquiries after Miſs <hi>Golding,</hi> yet I purpoſely avoided appearing in her Preſence, leſt the Sight of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0237300103:24"/>one ſo obnoxious ſhould add to her Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. At length the good old Man came to me, wringing his Hands, will you not go <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays he, will you not go and ſee <hi>Matilda</hi> before ſhe dies? The Doctors tell me they have tried all the Powers of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, but that they do not yet know what to make of her Sickneſs.</p>
               <p>My dear Sir, ſaid I, it is then no longer time to conceal from you what I know or conjecture concerning this Matter. Miſs <hi>Matilda,</hi> herſelf, entruſted me with the Secret, but under the ſtricteſt Injunctions of Silence; the Extremity of her Caſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ought to diſpenſe with all ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. Your Daughter loves, Sir, ſhe loves with Paſſion, but who the Object of her Affections is I cannot imagine. Let it be your Part to diſcover what ſhe ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly hides from the World, ſhe will refuſe nothing to the Authority or rather to the Tenderneſs of ſuch a Parent.</p>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> left me, but returned in about an Hour. His whole Frame ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to labour with ſomething extraordinary. You were right, <hi>Harry,</hi> he cried, you were right in your Conjectures; my Prayers and my Tears have at length prevailed, with difficulty I have wrung the Secret from her. O, my Son! it is greatly in your Power to befriend us. Would you not do
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0237300103:25"/>ſomething for the Relief of a Family who doat upon you as we do? would you not do ſomething for your old Friend who loves you as fondly as ever Father loved a Child? Something for you, Sir, ſaid I, yes, every thing, all things that are poſſible to be done. But, pray Sir, do I know the Party? You do, <hi>Harry,</hi> you do, he cried, for, as the Prophet ſaid unto <hi>David,</hi> thou art the Man.</p>
               <p>Me, Sir! I exclaimed, impoſſible! ſhe cannot bear my Sight, ſhe hates me, ſhe deteſts the Ground I go upon. Not ſo, ſaid he, not ſo, ſhe loves the very Duſt upon which you tread. Something ſurely is due in Mitigation of the Calamities which you have occaſioned. We lie at your Mercy, Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> my precious Daughter and myſelf, it is your's to bid us live or die at your Pleaſure, to cruſh us into nothing, or to reſtore us to Exiſtence, to Health, to Enjoyment. Will it hurt you, my Son, to do us theſe great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits? is it a Matter grievous to you to give Happineſs to thoſe, whoſe Exceſs of Love for you is their only Misfortune? A princely Fortune attends you. We and all we have are yours, Mr. <hi>Clinton.</hi> We are deſirous of depending on your Bounty alone. Let the Extremeneſs of my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Affection for you excite ſomething more kindly than Hatred in your Breaſt.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0237300103:26"/>If not for her Sake, yet for mine, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Harry,</hi> let me beſeech you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain yourſelf before her, to affect ſome little Tenderneſs, ſome Appearance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that may revive her, awhile at leaſt, from the deplorable State under which ſhe languiſhes.</p>
               <p>While he ſpoke I was agitated by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable Emotions, and he might have proceeded much further, before I ſhould have had the Power to reply. At length I caſt myſelf on my Knee, and catching his Hand to my Boſom, Ah, my Friend, my Father, my dear Father, I cried, am I then no better than a Barbarian in your Sight? To me would you impute ſuch Sentiments of Cruelty and Ingratitude? Take my Hand, Sir, take my Heart, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them as you pleaſe. All that I have, all that I am is yours and your Daughter's, without any kind of Reſerve for any other Perſon breathing.</p>
               <p>The good Man caught me in his Arms, and preſſed me to his Breaſt in a long and ſpeechleſs Ecſtaſy; then, taking me by the Hand, he led me in Silence to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Apartment.</p>
               <p>As we entered ſhe turned her Eyes toward the Door, and her pale and languid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was ſtraight ſuffuſed with a ſhort
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0237300103:27"/>lived Red. I was ſo affected by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which I beheld her, that I ſcarcely was able to reach her Bedſide, where kneeling down I gently took one of her Hands, and preſſing it between mine, I bathed it in a ſilent Shower of Tears.</p>
               <p>Ah, my Papa, ſhe faintly cried, I fear you have betray'd me, Mr. <hi>Harry</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed of my Weakneſs. I am informed, ſaid I, my lovely, my all-beloved Siſter, I am informed that I am permitted to hope for a Happineſs that is infinitely above my Merit, but it ſhall be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Buſineſs of my Life to deſerve it.</p>
               <p>My Dear, ſaid Mr. <hi>Golding,</hi> I perceive you are ſomething fluſter'd, your Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too weak for ſuch Emotions as theſe. For the preſent your Brother <hi>Harry</hi> muſt leave you. To-morrow, I truſt, you will be better able to ſupport our Company.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I took her Hand, and, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing upon it a tender and warm Kiſs, I juſt ventured to look up, and ſaw her fine Eyes ſuffuſed with a glittering Tear, and her Countenance bent upon me with a Look of indeſcribable Sweetneſs and Delight; but Mr. <hi>Golding,</hi> to prevent the Effects of too tender a Scene, inſtantly took me by the Arm and led me away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0237300103:28"/>
As he perceived that my Spirits had been much diſturbed, he ordered a Bottle to his own Chamber, and told me that he requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome further Converſe with me. As ſoon as we had taken our Seats, he looked earneſtly upon me, then ſeized me by the Hand, and looked at me again. But ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly getting up, he turned and ſtepped to the Window, and, breaking into Tears, he there wept and ſobbed for good Part of an Hour.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was ſomewhat compoſed, he reſumed his Seat. Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> ſays he, are you really ſincere in your Profeſſions with Reſpect to my Daughter? Shall I be rid of my Doubts at once? May I venture to aſk you a Queſtion, on which my own Life as well as that of my Child may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend? Should it pleaſe the Almighty to raiſe her from her preſent Bed of Sickneſs, is it actually your Intention to make her your Wife?</p>
               <p>Here, I demanded with ſome Warmth, is that a Queſtion, Sir, at this time? What Reaſon have I given you to ſuſpect my Honour or my Truth?—I do not ſuſpect you, my <hi>Harry,</hi> I do not ſuſpect you; I know you would not deceive me, but you may have deceived yourſelf. Your Nature is tender and full of Pity; and, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0237300103:29"/>Eſtate in which my Girl lies, your great Compaſſion may have eaſily been miſtaken by you for Love. Your Friendſhip for me alſo may have helped to impoſe upon you, and you may have conſtrued your Regard and Attachment to the Father into a Sentiment of Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Affection for the Child. But O, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſhould any other Woman be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable in your Eyes; or ſhould it not be in my Girl's Power to win and wear your Affections, I ſhall then have been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in making you wretched, and my Heart may as well be broken the one way as the other.—No, my Father, no. I have no foreign <hi>Dalilahs,</hi> no ſecret Amours, no Pleaſures that ſhun the Light. My Heart is a virgin Heart, and my <hi>Matilda</hi> poſſeſſes it without a Rival.</p>
               <p>From the Time that I was ſenſible of my Father's Partiality, a little Matter of Ambition, whether laudable or otherwiſe, incited me to attempt a Diſtinction that would raiſe me toward a Level with an only Brother who looked down with Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and Contempt upon me. Thence I became indefatigable in my Studies at School and College, as alſo in my Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation under you, Sir, during the firſt Years of my Apprenticeſhip, and this left me no Manner of Leiſure for female At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments. Indeed I dreaded the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0237300103:30"/>of any Advances from the Sex, and turned from them as I would from ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gins or Pit-falls purpoſely dug for my Deſtruction. My Converſation, Sir, has been very little among the Fair, and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting my natural Propenſity to the Sex, I never, till very lately, conceived a Liking for any Woman. In Truth, my dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Lady is not alive whom my Judgment or Inclinations would prefer to your <hi>Matilda.</hi> You need not fear my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wretched, I think myſelf moſt happy in her Affections.</p>
               <p>Then, ſaid he, I pronounce her the happieſt of Women. And now, my <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> I will tell you a Secret. From the firſt time that I beheld you, I wiſhed you for my Daughter, I wiſh'd that ſhe might have Charms to attract and fix your Heart; but, as I feared, and was perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that this was not the Caſe, I forbore to indulge myſelf in ſuch flattering Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. You know I never took you with me to ſee her at the Boarding-School, the true Reaſon was that I dreaded expoſing her young and inexperienced Heart to ſuch a Temptation, leſt ſhe ſhould conceive and languiſh under a hopeleſs Paſſion.</p>
               <p>On her Return to Town, my Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, on your Score, were much abated, as I imagined that the great Number of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0237300103:31"/>her gay and gliſtering Suitors would divide or at leaſt divert her Attention from you; and I purpoſely laid all the Buſineſs of our Houſe on your Shoulders, that ſhe might have as little of your Company as poſſible.</p>
               <p>I further had the Precaution to warn my Child againſt the Danger of any Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for you. <hi>Matty,</hi> ſaid I, one Day, among all this Aſſembly of fair and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Youths you are free and welcome to chuſe your Companion for Life, there is only One who ſtands excepted, One only whom you muſt not look upon with any Eye of Expectation. Who is that, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa? My young Brother and Partner in Trade, ſaid I. He looks much higher, <hi>Matty,</hi> than to the Daughter of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. His Proſpects are immenſe. He is only Brother and Heir to the Earl of <hi>Moreland</hi> who is now on his Travels, a diſſolute young Man, whoſe Vices in all likelihood will quickly carry him off, and, in ſuch a Caſe, our <hi>Harry Clinton</hi> would be conſidered as the firſt Perſon in the Land.</p>
               <p>Ah! Sir, I cried, I may bleſs your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition with regard to me, it was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the happy, the only Cauſe of my <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda</hi>'s Partiality in my Favour. The good Man ſmiled and proceeded. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what I ſaid to <hi>Matty,</hi> I had not given up all Thoughts of you myſelf.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0237300103:32"/>While ſhe talked or ſung in your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, I often turned my Eye upon you, and thought, at times, that I perceived a growing Tenderneſs in your Behaviour, which, further Acquaintance, I truſted, might ripen into Love. But when, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to try you, I propoſed your Advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Behalf of <hi>Spelling,</hi> and that you appeared to undertake it with Readineſs and Pleaſure, I at once dropped all my fond and flattering Hopes concerning you, and I heartily wiſhed that my Child had accepted that modeſt and worthy young Man. Bleſſed, however, be the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand of that Providence who, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly, hath conducted Matters to the Iſſue of this Hour, and fulfilled the capital Wiſh of my Life. But, I will no longer delay carrying to my dear Child the glad Tidings of your Affection; it will prove the beſt of Balms to her wounded Mind, and will cloſe her Eyes, for this Night, in Reſt and Peace of Heart.</p>
               <p>I was ſcarce dreſſed the next Morning, when <hi>Matilda</hi>'s favourite Maid enter'd my Chamber and bid me good Morrow. Mrs. <hi>Suſan,</hi> ſaid I, your pleaſant Countenance bids me preſume that Miſs <hi>Golding</hi> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. — O, vaſtly better, vaſtly better, Sir, I aſſure you; ſhe ſlept ſweetly all the Night, and did not want for happy Dreams either, I warrant.—Here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0237300103:33"/>for your good News—No Sir, no, I never take Money from Gentlemen; my Miſtreſs's Generoſity does not leave me to the Temptation. I love my Miſtreſs, Sir, and I think we ought all rather to join and fee you, Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> as well for Yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday's Viſit, as for another which I hope you will pay her to Day. A Fiddle for theſe old Doctors, one pretty young Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is better worth than a Score of them.—<hi>Suſan,</hi> as it ſhould ſeem, had been an Obſerver, and did not want for Penetration in ſuch Matters.—Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> ſhe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I'd give my laſt Quarter's Wages to know what Charm it is that you carry about you, to make all the pretty Ladies ſo fond of you.—In Truth, Mrs. <hi>Suſan,</hi> I am equally a Stranger to the Charm and to the Fondneſs that you talk of. — Don't tell me, Sir, don't tell me. The very Day of that Night on which my Miſtreſs fell ſick, here was a Lady in her Chariot to enquire for you, one of the lovelieſt young Creatures I ever ſet my Eyes on. I know ſhe aſked very particularly and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affectionately for you; for though it was my Miſtreſs to whom ſhe ſpoke, I ſtood within hearing.—It muſt, I cried, have been ſome Miſtake or ſome Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for I aſſure you, Mrs. <hi>Suſan,</hi> that I know of no ſuch Perſon. But pray be ſo good as to bear my Compliments to your
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0237300103:34"/>young Lady, and tell her that I wait her Permiſſion to attend her.</p>
               <p>I forgot to tell you, Madam, that, agreeable to the Advice which Mr. <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> had given me, I went to felicitate my Uncle <hi>Goodall</hi> on his Marriage with your Mother. He had already been informed of my recent Admiſſion into Partnerſhip, and thereupon received me with very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Marks of Eſteem and Affection.</p>
               <p>Your Mother, at that Time, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding lovely in her Perſon and Manners, at every Seaſon of Leiſure I frequented their Houſe, and ſhe conceived a very tender and warm Friendſhip for me, but, during Miſs <hi>Golding</hi>'s Illneſs, I had not been to viſit them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suſan</hi> was but juſt gone, when Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> came and told me that he believed his <hi>Matty</hi> would be pleaſed to ſee me. I inſtantly obeyed the Summons. As I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd I obſerved that ſhe ſat up in her Bed, a Morning Gown was wrapped about her, and <hi>Suſan</hi> with the Help of Pillows ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her behind. On my appearing her Spirits again took the Alarm. She ſcarce ventured a Glance toward me. I was greatly pained by the Abaſhment under which I ſaw ſhe laboured, and I haſtened
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0237300103:35"/>to relieve myſelf as well as her from the Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>I ſat down by the Bed-ſide, and gently taking one of her Hands, without looking in her Face, my dear Miſs <hi>Golding,</hi> ſaid I, I hope you will not be jealous of your Papa's Affection for me. He has, indeed, been too partial, too generous toward me, and has approved himſelf more than a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to me. He is not ſatisfied with allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to call you by the tender Name of Siſter, he further gives me Leave to hope that I may be united to you by the neareſt and deareſt of all Ties. Nothing but your Conſent is wanting, my Siſter, to make me the happieſt of Mankind. You are ſilent, my <hi>Matilda,</hi> may I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to call you mine? Bleſs'd be your Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, my Angel, I will dare then to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it in my own Favour?—Indeed I ſhould long ſince have made the preſent Declaration, I ſhould long ſince have avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Inclinations, my Affection, my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for you; but I did not preſume to liſten to my own Heart on the Occaſion, I did not ſuffer it to tell me how much you were beloved. Amidſt ſo many Suitors of the firſt Rank and Merit, who were juſtly called together by your numberleſs Attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I deemed it a Flight by much too high for me to aſpire at a Competition for the Happineſs of your Hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0237300103:36"/>
Here, venturing to look up, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that ſhe had put her Handkerchief to her Eyes. Ah! Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> ſhe cried with a trembling Voice, you are very delicate, you are ſweetly delicate indeed; but ought I to take the Advantage of this Delicacy? I ſee that you would ſave me from the Confuſion of an Avowal, you would ſave me from the mortifying Senſibility of my own Weakneſs. But, Sir, you ought not to eſteem that a Weakneſs in me, which I account my chiefeſt Merit and which is my chiefeſt Pride. I am proud of my Gratitude, I am proud of my Diſcernment. From the Moment that you preſerved me, againſt Arms and againſt Odds, at the great Peril of your own Life, in you, and you alone, I ſaw every thing that was amiable, every thing that was excellent. But then I dreaded leſt all Women ſhould behold you with my Eyes; and, above all, I doubly dreaded and was fearfully aſſured that you never would have any Eyes or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention for me. You have at length ſeen, or are rather informed concerning my Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. You pity me, you wiſh to relieve me, and you would love me if you could. It is enough, Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> even this perhaps is quite as much of Happineſs as I can bear.</p>
               <p>Here, again, I began to profeſs and to proteſt the Sincerity and Ardour of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0237300103:37"/>but ſhe cut me ſhort and ſaid, I know your Sincerity, Sir, you are perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that you love me, becauſe as yet you know not what Love is. True Love, Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> by its own Light, ſees into and throughout the Boſom of the Party belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I am very ſenſible of the Tenderneſs of your Friendſhip for me, and that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility conſtitutes the Whole of my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. I truſt alſo that it is all the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs I ſhall ever deſire. To ſee you, to hear you, to have you with me, to gaze upon you while you are looking another Way, to be permitted to attend, to ſerve you, to conduce to your Satisfactions, it is a Lot that will lift me above that of Mortality, that will cauſe me to account myſelf the firſt among Women.</p>
               <p>Ah, I cried, can I ſay nothing, can I do nothing to convince you how dear, how exceedingly dear you are to me? I certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved you, long before I knew what it was to be a Lover. I now feel the united Force of thoſe imperceptible Degrees by which the pleaſing Intruder daily ſtole and grew upon me. Believe me, my <hi>Matilda,</hi> when I preſumed to preſent you with this as a Token of my Affection, I held it for a Trifle altogether unworthy of you; accept it, however, I beſeech you, for the Sake of the Giver!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0237300103:38"/>
And, is this the Gem, ſays ſhe, which I caſt from me with ſuch Diſdain?—For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, my Brother, it is juſt ſo that the World caſts from them the Pearl of much mightier Price. I would to Heaven, that I could reject all the Pomps, Pleaſures and Vanities of this tranſitory World with the ſame Averſion that I ſpurned from me this eſtimable Jewel; but there is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Hope of that, Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> while you yourſelf may be partly numbered among tranſitory Things.</p>
               <p>Here I was quite overcome by the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the dear Girl, and, urged on by a ſudden Tranſport, I caught her to my Boſom with a Force that was ſomething too much for her Weakneſs. On Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, I attempted to apologize for my Indiſcretion, but ſhe ſweetly cried, Ah! Mr. <hi>Harry,</hi> never repent of ſuch Faults, may I often, may I daily tempt you to be guilty of them. But tell me, and tell me truly, Mr. <hi>Clinton;</hi> theſe Gems, when you firſt purchaſed them, were they actually intended for me? were they not rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for your <hi>Fanny,</hi> for your own <hi>Fanny,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clinton?</hi> What can you mean? I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, I know of no <hi>Fanny</hi> in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, with whom I have any Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. That is ſtrange! ſhe replied, very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0237300103:39"/>extraordinary, indeed! but, leſt you ſhould think me of a jealous or whimſical Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I will relate the Affair to you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, as it happened.</p>
               <p>On the Day, in which I took to my Bed, I was looking out at the Parlout Window, when a Chariot and ſix Horſes whirled up to our Door. I obſerved a ſingle Lady in it, whom I ſuppoſed of my Acquaintance, and inſtantly ſent <hi>Suſan</hi> to requeſt her to walk in. On her entering, I was greatly ſtruck by the Beauty of her Figure, and eyed her very inquiſitively from Head to Foot. Having curteſied gracefully to me, can you tell me, Miſs, ſays ſhe, is Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> at Home? No, indeed, Madam, ſaid I; but if you will be pleaſed to entruſt me with your Commands—It is only, Miſs, that I requeſt to ſee him as ſoon as poſſible — And, pray Madam, where ſhall he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you—O, he will know that inſtantly, when you tell him it was <hi>Fanny Goodall,</hi> his own <hi>Fanny Goodall</hi> who was here to wait upon him.—Good Heaven, I cried out, my Aunt, my Aunt <hi>Goodall,</hi> my very Aunt I aſſure you!—What do you ſay, what do you tell me, your Aunt, Sir, can it be? Ah, ſhe is too young, and too lovely to be an Aunt, Mr. <hi>Harry.</hi>—The very ſame, indeed, Madam, there is no other <hi>Fanny Goodall.</hi> I admit, as you ſay, that ſhe is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0237300103:40"/>young and exceeding lovely, but ſtill ſhe is a Wife, and likely ſoon, as I think, to be a Mother. Alas, ſays my <hi>Matilda,</hi> what a doleful Jeſt is this! a cruel Aunt ſhe has been to me I am ſure, what Days of Sighs and Nights of Tears ſhe has coſt me! Ah, that heart-breaking Term, <hi>his own, his own Fanny;</hi> I think I ſhall never be able to forgive her that Expreſſion!</p>
               <p>As Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> juſt then entered, we dropped the Subject we were upon. Why, <hi>Matty,</hi> ſays he, you are quite another Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I think I never ſaw you wear ſo happy a Face. I know you are come to chide me, ſays ſhe, for keeping your Partner from Buſineſs; but pay me down the Portion you intended for me, Papa, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſe you the Damage of every Hour of his Abſence. Yes, my Love, cries the tender Father, if Wealth might ſerve, for Wages, to a Heart like that of my <hi>Harry,</hi> he ſhall be very amply payed for every Act and Inſtance of his Affection and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to you. Every Hour of my Life, I cried, is already her Due; ſhe has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay to One who is her Debtor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Account.</p>
               <p>During ſeveral following Days, Miſs <hi>Golding</hi> recovered with amazing Rapidity. In leſs than than five Weeks ſhe looked
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0237300103:41"/>plumper and fairer than ever. Peace ſmiled in her Countenance. Joy laughed in her Eyes. Her whole Frame appeared as actuated by ſome internal Muſic. And thus, all lovely and beloved, ſhe was given up to my Arms, in the Preſence of my Uncle and Aunt and of a few City Friends.</p>

                  <p>As I wiſh that none of your Faults ſhould paſs by me unnoticed, ſo I am willing to allow you all your juſt Praiſes. Your Story of your old Friend is, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, very ſimple, natural, and domeſtic; and to a Mind, yet undebauched, exceedingly intereſting and affecting; for it opens and inveſtigates a Number of little Paſſages and Mazes in the Heart, which are quite cloſed, or imperceptible to Perſons of hard Nerves and callous Conceptions. I am free, however, to tell you that I felt myſelf offended by the Compliments which Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> pays to himſelf through the Mouth of your <hi>Matilda.</hi> It is, indeed, a very rare Matter for People to ſpeak of themſelves with due Decency and Delicacy. I wiſh you could have procured ſome other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit for conveying to us the Hiſtory of your Knight.

               <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
               <p>HERE the Counteſs, for the firſt Time, broke in upon her Couſin's Narration. Happy <hi>Matilda,</hi> ſhe cried, how diſtinguiſh'd was thy Deſtiny! were it but for a Year, were it but for a Day, for that Day thou didſt yet enjoy the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all thy Wiſhes, a Lot rarely allowed to any Daughter of <hi>Adam.</hi> I was not then born to envy her State. Sweet Girl, ſhe deſerved you, ſhe was after my own Heart, the Exceſs of her Paſſion for you made her truly worthy of you. But tell me, my Couſin, how could you be ſo long ignorant of the dear Girl's Affection for you? The Language of Love is ſo very intelligible, ſo expreſſive through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Motion and every Organ, as muſt, with ſufficient Clearneſs, have opened your Eyes to the Object. Indeed, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> ſhe herſelf led me away from any ſuch Apprehenſion, by drawing ſo many Pictures of the Man whom ſhe ſaid ſhe loved, all copied from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her own Brain, and covered and diſguiſed with ſuch imaginary Excellencies as muſt have prevented myſelf, as well as every one living, from perceiving therein the ſmalleſt Trace of my own Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. Don't tell me, cried Lady <hi>Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0237300103:44"/>ſhe was a true and a ſweet Painter, and I ſhould have known you by her Portrait in the Midſt of a Million. But proceed, I beſeech you, my whole Soul is in your Story.</p>
               <p>Within a few Months after my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, continued Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> you, my Couſin, firſt opened your fair Eyes to the Light, and my <hi>Matty</hi> and I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being your Sponſors.</p>
               <p>Within the firſt Year of my Marriage, my Girl, alſo, brought a Son into the World, and within the two Years follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was deliver'd of a Daughter.</p>
               <p>The Joy of the Grandfather, on thoſe Events, was indeſcribable. Alas, good Man! he thought that he perceived, in their infant Aſpects, a thouſand happy Promiſes and opening Proſpects. He ſaw himſelf, as it were, perpetuated in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending and widening Progeny, who, like their native <hi>Thames,</hi> ſhould roll down in a Tide of expanding Wealth and Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He wanted that all the World ſhould participate of his Happineſs, and our Houſe once more became the Houſe of Feſtivity.</p>
               <p>A Number of external Succeſſes, alſo, aſſiſted to perſuade us, in thoſe Days, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0237300103:45"/>Felicity was to be attained and aſcertained upon Earth. The Regency of <hi>Cromwel</hi> was adminiſter'd with the ſtricteſt Juſtice at Home, while, at the ſame Time, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came revered and formidable abroad, and extended its Influence to Regions the moſt remote. Under the Protection of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Flag, we ſent our Ships out to the Eaſt, and to the Weſt, and Wealth came pouring in upon us from all Quarters of the Globe.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, my Wife and I lived together in perfect Harmony. Though my Commerce and Acquaintance was greatly extended, I had yet formed no Friendſhips, from Home, that partook of heart-felt Tenderneſs, except for your Mama. All my Pleaſures and Deſires, all my World was, in a Manner, confined and abſorbed within the Compaſs of my own Walls. In the good old Man and his Daughter, and in the Pledges of their endearing Attachment to me, every Wiſh that my Soul could form was centered. Mutual Joy ſat round our Board, mutual Peace prepared our Pillows, and, during a ſwimming Period of ſix Years, I ſcarce remember to have experienced the ſmalleſt Diſcontent, ſave what aroſe from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinancy of my Wife's Affection for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0237300103:46"/>
While ſhe continued to bleſs my Arms, I thought that no one had ever loved with greater Warmth than I loved her; and yet, at Times I remarked a very ſtriking Difference between the Manner and Effects of our Feelings for each other. If Buſineſs detained me an Hour extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary abroad, the panting of her Boſom, that Eagerneſs of Look with which ſhe received me, was to me a painful Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of her Anxiety during my Abſence. One Evening I found her in fainting Fits, merely becauſe ſhe was told that a Duel had juſt happened between Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> and a Perſon who had much the Reſemblance of her <hi>Clinton.</hi> In ſhort, if my Head or my Finger ached, I found myſelf under the Neceſſity of concealing my Ailment, and of aſſuming a Chearfulneſs diſagreeable to the Occaſion, to prevent the worſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of her ready Alarms. On the other Hand, my Affection was tranquil and ſerene; it was tender and fervent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but without Tumult or Diſturbance; a Species of Love which I afterwards found to be by far the moſt eligible; for every kind of Paſſion is unqueſtionably a kind of Suffering; Love in God, therefore, muſt be wholly an Action, it acts infinitely upon Others without any Poſſibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acted upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0237300103:47"/>
Thus the Years of my Life moved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon Down, when the Small-pox, that capital Enemy to Youth and Beauty, became epidemical in the City. Our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren caught the Contagion. All poſſible Care was taken, and all poſſible Art em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. A Number of Phyſicians was kept conſtantly about them. Fifteen Days of their Illneſs were already elapſed, and the Doctors pronounced them out of Danger; when the Diſtemper took a ſudden and malignant Turn, and, in one and the ſame Minute, both my Babes expired in the Arms of their Mother.</p>
               <p>I was in the Room, at the Time, and as I knew the extreme Tenderneſs of my <hi>Matty</hi>'s Nature, all my Concern, as well as Attention, was turned upon her. I took her fondly by the Hand, and, looking up to her Face, I was inſtantly alarmed and ſhocked by that placid Serenity which appeared in her Countenance, and which I expected to be quickly changed into ſome frantic Eruption. But, firſt drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a ſmiling Tear on her Infants, and then lifting her gliſtening Eyes to Heaven, I thank thee, I thank thee, O my Maſter, ſhe cried, thou haſt made me of ſome Uſe, I have not been born in vain; thou haſt ordained me the humble Vehicle of two ſafe and certain Angels, living Attendants
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0237300103:48"/>on thy Throne, and ſweet Singers of thy Praiſes in the Kingdom of little Children, for ever and for ever. I have yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent left, more Bleſſings remaining than ſuit the Lot of Mortality; take me from them, I beſeech thee, whenever it is thy good Pleaſure, for I fear there are ſome of them, which I could not, I could not bear to have taken away from me. So prayed the dear Saint, and looking eagerly at me, no, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſhe cried out, I fear, I fear I could not bear it! So ſaying, ſhe ſuddenly caſt herſelf into my Boſom, and graſping at my Neck, and guſhing into a Flood of Anguiſh, we mingled our Sobs and our Tears together till no more were left to be ſhed.</p>
               <p>You are affected, my deareſt Couſin, I had better ſtop here. If you are moved by ſmall Matters, how would your Heart be wrung by ſome enſuing Diſtreſſes; I muſt not venture to proceed.</p>
               <p>Go on, cried the Counteſs, go on, I inſiſt upon it. I love to weep, I joy to grieve, it is my Happineſs, my Delight to have my Heart broken in Pieces.</p>
               <p>We were, both of us; much relieved by the vent of our mutual Paſſion, for, though my Wife ſtill continued to keep to me and cling about me, ſhe yet ſeemed to be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0237300103:49"/>ſweetly compoſed, and ſunk, within my Arms, as into a Bed and Depth of Peace.</p>
               <p>At length, I liſtened to a Kind of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and Buſtle in the Hall, and I heared ſome one diſtinctly cry, O my Maſter, my Maſter!</p>
               <p>We ſtarted up at the Inſtant. Mr. <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> had been from Home at the time of the deadly Criſis of my two darling little Ones, and had quieted all his Fears, and renewed all his Proſpects, in the View and full Aſſurance of their Life and quick Recovery. We had been too much engaged and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, in our own perſonal Griefs, to give to our Servants the ſeaſonable Precaution of breaking the Matter to our Father by unalarming Degrees; and a rude Fellow, at his Entrance, bluntly told him that the Children were both dead; whereupon he clapped his Hands together, and, caſting himſelf into a Chair, remained without Senſe or Motion.</p>
               <p>When we ran up, we were greatly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the Manner of his Aſpect, though his Eyes were cloſed, his Brows were gloomy and contracted, while the nether Part of his Face looked quiet and compoſed.</p>
               <p>I inſtantly ſent for a Surgeon, and recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Phyſicians who had but lately left
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0237300103:50"/>us; while my <hi>Matty</hi> ſtood motionleſs, with her Hands cloſed together and her Eyes fixed upon her Father. At length ſhe cried out, my Papa, my Papa, my dear Papa, I would I would I had died before I came to this Hour! but, bleſſed be thy Will ſince it is thy Will, O God! when all other Props are ſapped and plucked from under me I truſt to fall into thee, my Father which art in Heaven!</p>
               <p>Being put to Bed, and bled, he recovered Motion and Speech, and we got him to ſwallow a compoſing Draught, though he did not yet recollect any Perſon or Thing about him.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding our late Fatigues, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and I ſat up with him moſt of the Night; and then, ordering a Pallet to be brought into the Room, we lay down to take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reſt toward Morning. Alas, ſaid I to myſelf, how rich was I Yeſterday, how is my World abridged! theſe narrow Walls now contain all that is left me of all the Poſſeſſions that I value upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Poor Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> was but ill qualified to bear Calamity. His Life had been a Life of ſound Health and Succeſſes; and he never had been acquainted with Sickneſs, or with Affliction, ſave on the Death of his Wife whom he had married for Money,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0237300103:51"/>and on the Illneſs of his Daughter as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready related.</p>
               <p>As he had taken an Opiate, he did not awaken till it was late in the Day. Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Head toward me, is it you, <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays he? How do you find yourſelf, Sir, ſaid I? — Why, has any thing been the Matter with me? Indeed I don't feel myſelf right; but, ſend my Children to me; ſend my <hi>Jacky</hi> and my little <hi>Harriet;</hi> the Sight of them will be a Reſtorative beyond all the Cordials in the World. — You are ſilent, <hi>Harry</hi> — What is the meaning? — O, now I begin to remember — my ſweet Babies, my little Play-fellows, I ſhall never ſee you any more!</p>
               <p>Here, he burſt into the moſt violent Guſh of Paſſion. He groaned, he wept, he cried aloud with heart-piercing Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while I caught up <hi>Matty</hi> in my Arms, and, running with her to a diſtant Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, catched a Kiſs and locked her in.</p>
               <p>I returned, but found him in the ſame Violence of Agitation. I ſpoke to him, I would have comforted him; but he cried, be quiet, <hi>Harry,</hi> I will not be comforted. I will go to my Children, they ſhall not be torn from me, we will die, we will be buried, we will lie in the ſame Grave to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0237300103:52"/>
As I found myſelf ſick, and ready to faint under the Oppreſſion of his Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, I withdrew to the next Chamber, and there plentifully vented the contagious Shower.</p>
               <p>After ſome time I liſtened and perceived that all was quiet, and returning, I found him in a kind of troubled Doze, from whence he fell into a deep and peaceful Sleep. Thus he continued, for three Days, wailing and ſlumbring by Fits, without taſting any Matter of Nouriſhment, though his Daughter and I implored him, on our Knees, and with Tears. No Reaſonings, no Entreaties could avail for appeaſing him, it was from the Aſſociation of our Sorrows alone that he appeared to admit of any Conſolation.</p>
               <p>At length his Paſſion ſubſided into a ſullen and ſilent Calm; he would ſpeak to no body, he would anſwer none of us except by Monoſyllables.</p>
               <p>Within a few following Weeks, News was brought me that our Ship the Phoenix was arrived in the <hi>Downs,</hi> ſafe and richly laden from the Eaſt Indies.</p>
               <p>Immediately I carried the Tidings to the old Man, in the pleaſing Expectation that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0237300103:53"/>they would ſerve to divert, or, at leaſt, to amuſe his Melancholy. But, fixing his Look upon me, wherefore, <hi>Harry,</hi> doſt thou tell me of Ships and Indies, he cried; both Indies are poor to me, they have nothing that they can ſend me. I have no Road to go upon Earth, no Way upon Sea to navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, I am already become a wild and waſted <hi>Babylon,</hi> wherein the Voice of Muſic ſhall never more be heared. O ye old and unbleſs'd Knees, where are now your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Babies, who were wont to play about ye, and to cling and climb upon ye? gone, gone, gone, gone, never, never to return.</p>
               <p>Here, breaking into Tears, I cried, we are both young yet, my Father, we may yet have many Children to be the Comfort of your Age. No, my <hi>Harry,</hi> no, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, you may, indeed, have many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren but you never will have any Children like my darling Children.</p>
               <p>Love, as it ſhould ſeem, my Couſin, like Bodies, has its Weight, and gains additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Velocity in the Deſcent. It deſcends from God to his Creatures, and ſo from Creature to Creature, but rarely knows a due Return of Affection or Gratitude. It is therefore incomparably more intenſe in the Parent than in the Child, and ſtill acquires encreaſing Fondneſs toward the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child and ſo downward. Nay, you may,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0237300103:54"/>almoſt univerſally, obſerve it more warm in Patrons toward their Dependents, than in thoſe who are benefitted toward their Benefactors.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Golding,</hi> from this Time, no more entered his Counting-houſe, nor paid nor received Viſits, nor kept up any Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence. Even my Company and that of his Daughter appeared to oppreſs him, and he rarely left his Apartment, where an old folio Bible was his only Companion.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I began to withdraw our Effects from Trade, and having called in the beſt Part of them, I lodged near Half a Million in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Funds. When I went to adviſe with my Father on the Occaſion, what, my Child, ſaid he, what have I to ſay to the World, or to the Things of the World? Do juſt as you pleaſe with the one and with the other; and never conſult a Perſon on any Affair wherein the Party conſulted has no Intereſt or Concern.</p>
               <p>One Morning, as I lay in Bed, <hi>Matty</hi> threw her Arms about me, and hiding her bluſhing Face in my Boſom, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays ſhe, if you could handſomely bring it about to my poor Papa, perhaps it would be ſome Matter of Conſolation to him to know that I am with Child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0237300103:55"/>
When I broke the Matter to him, he did not, at firſt, appear to be ſenſibly affected; in time, however, the Weight of his Affliction ſeemed conſiderably light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and, as my Wife advanced in her Pregnancy, he began to look us in the Face, he ſat with us at one Table, and became converſable as formerly.</p>
               <p>One Day I went to dine with Mr. <hi>Settle,</hi> a Hardware Merchant, who had appointed to pay me a large Sum of Money. On my Return in the Evening, through <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> attended only by my favourite <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> a very faithful and active Fellow, though it was yet fair Day, I was ſuddenly ſet upon by a Poſſe of Robbers, who ruſhed on me from behind a Cover. The firſt of them, running up, fired directly in my Face, but did me no further Damage than by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away a ſmall Piece of the upper Part of my left Ear. Had the Fools demanded my Money, I would have given it to them at a Word; but, finding them bent on Murder, I reſolved that they ſhould have my Life at as dear a Rate as poſſible. I inſtantly drew my Sword, and run the firſt through the Body; and then, ruſhing on the ſecond Aſſailant, I laid him alſo on the Ground, before he had Time to take his Aim, ſo that his Piſtol went harmleſly off in his Fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0237300103:56"/>
In the mean while, my brave and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Companion was not idle; with two Strokes of his oaken Cudgel he had levelled two more of them with the Earth. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Remainder halted, retreated into a Group, and then ſtood and fired upon us altogether; but, obſerving that we did not drop, they caſt their Arms to the Ground, and run off ſeveral Ways as faſt as they could. My good Friend, <hi>Tirlah O'Donnoh,</hi> then turned affectionately to me; are you hurt, my dear Maſter, ſays he? I believe I am, <hi>Tirlah,</hi> let us make Home the beſt we can. O, cried the noble Creature, if no body was hurt but <hi>Tirlah, Tirlah</hi> would'nt be hurt at all.</p>
               <p>Here, taking me under the Arm, we walked ſlowly to the City, till coming to a hackney Coach he put me, tenderly, into, it, and ſitting beſide me, ſupported me, as I began to grow weak through much Effuſion of Blood.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as we got Home, the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as is their Practice, thundered at the Door, and my <hi>Matty,</hi> according to Cuſtom whenever I was abroad, was the readieſt of all our Domeſtics to open.</p>
               <p>By this Time I had fainted, and was quite inſenſible, but when my tender and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0237300103:57"/>true Mate ſaw me borne by two Men into her Preſence, all pale and bloody, ſhe, who thought ſhe had Fortitude to ſupport the Wreck of the World, gave a Shriek that was enough to alarm the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and inſtantly falling backward, got a violent Contuſion in the hinder Part of her Head.</p>
               <p>Immediately we were conveyed to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Beds, and all requiſite Help was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. It was found that I had received ſix or ſeven fleſh Wounds, but none of them proved dangerous, as they were given at a Diſtance and by Piſtol Shot. But, alas, my <hi>Matty</hi>'s Caſe was very different, ſhe fell into ſudden and premature Labour, and, having ſuffered extreme Anguiſh all the Night, during which ſhe ceaſed not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after me, ſhe was with Difficulty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of a male Infant, who was ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the Birth.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the good and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted old Gentleman hurried about, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, from One of us to the Other, wringing his Hands, and ſcarcely retaining his Senſes.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as my Wounds were dreſſed, and I had recovered my Memory, I looked about, and haſtily enquired for my Wife; but they cautiouſly anſwer'd me, that ſhe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0237300103:58"/>was ſomething indiſpoſed with the Fright which ſhe got at ſeeing me bloody, and that her Father had inſiſted on her going to Bed.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond Dreſſing of my Wounds, I was pronounced out of Danger, and then they ventured to tell me of my <hi>Matty</hi>'s Miſcarriage, and of the Bruiſe which ſhe had got in her Fall when ſhe fainted. On hearing this my Heart was cleft, as it were, in twain; I accuſed myſelf of the Murder of my Wife and Infant; and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed All, without Exception, of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion in not concealing my Diſaſter from her.</p>
               <p>At Times I began to fear that my Wife was either dead, or much worſe than they repreſented. On my third Dreſſing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I peremptorily inſiſted on my being carried into her Chamber. I ſent her Notice of my Viſit, and, on entering the Room, he lives then, ſhe cried, my Huſband, my <hi>Harry</hi> lives, it is enough, I ſhall die hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, I ſhall now depart in Peace.</p>
               <p>Here I ordered myſelf to be laid by her Side, when taking a Hand, which ſhe had feebly reached out, and preſſing it to my Lips, you would forſake me then, my <hi>Matty,</hi> you die, you ſay, and you die happy in leaving me the moſt wretched, the moſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0237300103:59"/>deſolate of Men. You die, my Love, you die; and I, who would have foſtered you and your Babe with my Vitals, 'tis I who have dug a Grave for the One and for the Other. But, you muſt not forſake me, my <hi>Matty,</hi> I will not be forſaken by you. Since we cannot live aſunder, let us die, let us die together!</p>
               <p>Here, a paſſionate Silence enſued on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part. But, my Wounds growing painful and beginning to bleed afreſh, I was obliged to be carried back to my own Apartment.</p>
               <p>Within a few Days more, I was ſo well recovered as to be able to walk about, from which time I was a conſtant Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on my Beloved, and became her moſt tender and aſſiduous Nurſekeeper.</p>
               <p>You muſt have heard, my Couſin, that the Cuſtoms and Manners of thoſe Times were altogether the Reverſe of what they are at preſent. Hypocriſy is no longer a Fault among Men, all now is avowed Libertiniſm and open Profaneneſs; and Children ſcoff at the Name and Profeſſion of that Religion which their Fathers rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. On the contrary, in thoſe Days, all Men were either real or pretended Zealots; every Mechanic profeſſed, like <hi>Aaron,</hi> to carry a <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> about him;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0237300103:60"/>and no Man would engage in any Buſineſs or Bargain, though with an Intent to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach his Neighbour, without going apart, as he ſaid, to conſult the Lord.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Matty,</hi> at the ſame Time, was the holieſt of all Saints, without any Parade of Sanctification. Her's was a Religion, of whoſe Value ſhe had the daily and hourly Experience; it was indeed a Religion of Power. It held her, as on a Rock, in the Midſt of a turbulent and fluctuating World. It gave her a Peace of Spirit that ſmiled at Provocation. It gave her Comfort in Affliction, Patience in Anguiſh, Exaltation in Humiliation, and Triumph in Death.</p>
               <p>In about five Weeks after her unhappy Miſcarriage, ſhe appeared on the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though by very ſlow Degrees, and with Aſſiſtance, at Times, ſat up in her Bed; when her oldeſt Phyſician, one Morning, called me apart, I am loath, Sir, ſaid he, very loath to acquaint you with my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. I wiſh I may be miſtaken, but I fear greatly for you, I fear that your dear Lady cannot recover. By the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms I conjecture that an Abſceſs, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume, is forming within her; but a few Days will aſcertain Matters either for us or againſt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0237300103:61"/>
Had all Sorts of evil Tidings come crowding One upon Other, I ſhould not have been affected as I then was affected. I could not riſe from my Seat to bid the Doctor adieu. My Knees trembled under me; a Swimming came before my Eyes; and a ſudden Sickneſs relaxed and reverſed my whole Frame. Alas, I had not, at that Time, the Reſource of my <hi>Matty;</hi> I had not on the Armour with which ſhe was armed to all Iſſues and Events. I, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, raiſed my Thoughts to Heaven, in a kind of helpleſs Acquieſcence rather than confident Reſignation. I ſtruggled, not to appear weaker than became my Manhood; and I ſaid to myſelf, Doctors have often been miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Having recollected my Strength and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the beſt I could, I adventured to enter my Wife's Apartment. She was juſt raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her Bed, from whence her pale and emaciated Countenance looked forth as the Sun, toward his Setting, looks through a ſickly Atmoſphere, in Confidence of his ariſing in the Fulneſs of Morning Glory.</p>
               <p>Having cautiouſly and dejectedly ſeated myſelf beſide her, ſhe reached out both her Hands, and, preſſing one of mine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, I love you no longer, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſhe cried; I love you no longer.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0237300103:62"/>Your Rival, at length, has conquered. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

O, my dear, my ſweet, mine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enemy, as I may ſay! Riches were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto me, Pleaſures were nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, the World was nothing unto me; You, and you only, <hi>Harry,</hi> ſtood between me and my Heaven, between me and my God. Long, and often, and vainly, have I ſtrove and ſtruggled againſt you; but my Bridegroom, at length, is become jealous of you; my true Owner calls me from you, and takes me all to himſelf! Be not alarmed then, my <hi>Harry,</hi> when I tell you that I muſt leave you. You will grieve for me, you will grieve greatly for me, my Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! but, give way to the kindly Shower that your Lord ſhed for his <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and let the Tears of Humanity alleviate and lighten the Weight of your Affliction.—Ah, my <hi>Harry,</hi> I tremble for you; what a Courſe you have to run!—what Perils! what Temptations! deliver him from them, my Maſter, deliver him from them all:—Again what bliſsful Proſpects—they are gone, they are vaniſhed!—I ſink, I die under the Weight and Length of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Miſery!—Again it opens, all is cleared, and his End, like that of <hi>Job,</hi> is more bleſſed than his Beginning.—Ah,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0237300103:63"/>my <hi>Harry,</hi> my <hi>Harry,</hi> your Heart muſt be wrung by many Engines, it ſhall be tried in many Fires, but I truſt it is a golden Heart, and will come forth with all its Weight.</p>
               <p>You have been dreaming, my Love, I ſaid, you have been dreaming; and the Impreſſion ſtill lies heavy and melancholy on your Memory.</p>
               <p>Yes, ſhe replied, I have been dreaming indeed; but then my Dreams are much more real then my waking Viſions. When all Things ſenſible are ſhut out, it is then that the Spirit enlarges, grows conſcious of its own Activity, its own Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſees by a Light whoſe Evidence is beyond that of the Sun. I will tell you a Secret, my <hi>Harry,</hi> there is nothing in the Univerſe but <hi>Littleneſs,</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> the <hi>Littleneſs</hi> of the Creature and the <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> of God, and in the Senſe of this lies the Eſſence of all Philoſophy and of all Religion. Be content, then, with your Lot, my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, be content to be little, if you wiſh to be great. Become a Nothingneſs, an Emptineſs, and then your God will bring the Fulneſs of his own Immenſity upon you, and will open a World in your Spirit more expanded and more glorious than this ſurrounding World with all its Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries.</p>

O, my Angel, I cried, ſhould any thing happen to you, I ſhould then be little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. But, I dare not look that Way, for I know, I find, I feel that I could not ſurvive you.</p>
               <p>You muſt ſurvive me, my <hi>Harry,</hi> nay you will once more be married. I beheld your Bride laſt Night. Even now ſhe ſtands before me, the Siſter of my Spirit, and one of the lovelieſt Compoſitions of Sin and Death that ever was framed for Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Her, alſo, you will loſe; and you will think, nay, you will aſſure yourſelf that no Powers in Heaven or Earth can avail for a Ray of Comfort. In this Life, however, you will finally, unexpectedly, and moſt wonderfully be bleſſed; and, ſoon after, we ſhall all meet and be more intimately and more endearingly wedded than ever, where yet there is neither marrying nor giving in Marriage.</p>
               <p>While ſhe yet ſpoke, her Pains, as the Pains of Labour, again came upon her, and went off, and again returned, after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted Swoonings.</p>
               <p>O, my Couſin, what a ſolemn, what a fearful Thing is Death! all our Inlets of Knowledge and Senſation cloſed at once! the Sound of Chear and the Voice of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

               <p>Where, at that Time, are your Scoffers, your Defiers of Futurity? where your merry Companions, who turn their own Eternity into Matter of Laugh and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule? dejected and aghaſt, their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance wholly fallen, and their Heart ſunk within them, they all tremble and wiſh to believe, in this the Hour of Diſſolution.

               <p>Far different was the State of my little and lowly <hi>Matty,</hi> my Saint of Saints, at that tremendous Period; where all Others would have ſunk, there ſhe ſoared aloft; and ſhe dropped the World and its Wealth, with her Body and all the ſenſible Affections thereof, with the ſame Satisfaction that a

               <p>Oh, my Beloved! ſhe would cry in the Midſt of her Pains, I have been weakly through Life, I have been Weakneſs it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore not able to take up thy Croſs; but be thou Strong in my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhew thy Mightineſs in me, and then lay it upon me with all its Weight!</p>
               <p>Again, after a Swoon, and when her Pangs became exceſſive, I refuſe not thy Proceſs, my Maſter, ſhe cried. Thy Croſs and thorny Crown they are all my Ambition. Point thy Thorns, twiſt them harder, let them pierce into my Soul, ſo thou ſuffer me not to fail or fall from thee, I care not.</p>
               <p>Think, my Couſin, what I endured upon that Occaſion, my rending Heart ſhared her Sufferings, and felt Pang for Pang. Nay, I was not far from murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and queſtioning with my God on his putting to ſuch Tortures the moſt guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of his Creatures. If the Lambs of thy Flock, I ſecretly ſaid, if thy Lambs are appointed to ſuch excruciating Senſations, what muſt be the Portion of ſuch Sinners as I am?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0237300103:67"/>
When ſhe drew near the Goal of her bleſſed Courſe upon Earth, O my almighty <hi>Samſon!</hi> ſhe faintly cried, thou ſhakeſt the two Pillars of my frail and ſinful Fabric; finiſh then thy Conqueſt in me; down, down with the whole Building ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ruin! let no one, O Lord, of mine Enemies or of thine Enemies eſcape thy victorious Arm! but ſlay all thoſe by my Death, with whom I have been vainly combating during my Life-time! So ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, her Pains in an Inſtant forſook her. The Form of her Countenance was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly changed from the Expreſſion of Agony into that of Ecſtaſy. She raiſed her Hands on high, and exerting herſelf to follow them, ſhe cried, I come, I come! then ſighed and dropped over.—The Muſcles of her Face ſtill retained the Stamp of the laſt Sentiment of her Soul, and while the Body haſtened to be mingled with Earth, it ſeemed to partake of that Heaven to which its Spirit had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</p>
               <p>You may think it odd, deareſt Madam, that, for ſome time paſt, I have taken no Note of the Man to whom I was tied by every poſſible Band of Duty, Gratitude and Affection. The Fact is, that, during the latter Part of my Wife's Illneſs, and for ſome Weeks after her Death, Mr. <hi>Golding</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0237300103:68"/>was confined to his Chamber by a ſevere Fit of the Gout, and the Acuteneſs of his Pains ſcarce permitted him to attend to any other Concern. While my <hi>Matty</hi> lived, therefore, I divided my Time and Aſſiduities as equally as I could between the Daughter and Father, and, at any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of Eaſe, I uſed to read to him his favourite Paſſages in the Bible.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as my Saint had expired, I charged the Servants not to give any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of her Death to their Maſter, but alas, our Silence and our Looks were too ſure Indicators of the fatal Tidings; for, from the higheſt to the leaſt, my <hi>Matty</hi> had been the Idol of the whole Houſe, and her Death appeared to them as the Loſs of every earthly Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Having looked, ſeveral times, intently and inquiſitively in my Face, well, <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Golding,</hi> all is over then, I ſee, we muſt go to her, but my Child ſhall no more return to us.—You are ſilent, my <hi>Harry.</hi>—O thou fell Glutton, Death! I had but one Morſel left for the whole of my Suſtenance, and that too thou haſt devoured. Here he gave a deep Groan, and ſunk into a State of Inſenſibility, from which, however, he was ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the Return of an anguiſhing Fit of the Gout.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0237300103:69"/>
When I look back, my fair Couſin, on the Paſſages of my Life; it is a Matter of Amazement to me, that a Creature ſo frail, ſo feebly and ſo delicately conſtituted as Man, with Nerves ſo apt to be racked, and a Heart to be wrung with Anguiſh, can poſſibly endure under the Weights of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that, at times, are laid upon him.</p>
               <p>I had not yet dropped a Tear. I was in a State of half ſtupid and half flighty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility; as One who, having loſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, had nothing further to look for, and therefore nothing to regard. But, when I ſaw my dear old Man, my beſt Friend, my Father, whelmed under ſuch a Depth of Affliction, all the Sluices of my Soul and inmoſt Affections were laid open, and I broke into an avowed Paſſion of Tears and Exclamations, till, like <hi>David</hi> in his Strife of Love with <hi>Jonathan,</hi> I exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I accuſed myſelf of all the Evils that had happened to his Houſe; and I devoted the Day to Darkneſs and the Night to Deſolation, wherein, by my Preſence and Connections, I had brought thoſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs upon him. The good Man was greatly ſtruck, and, I think, partly conſoled by the Exceſs of my Sorrows, and, all deſolate as he was, he attempted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter that Comfort to me which he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0237300103:70"/>himſelf wanted more than Any who had Life.</p>
               <p>Break not your Heart, my <hi>Harry,</hi> break not your Heart, my Child, he cried! de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me not of the only Conſolation that is left me; you are now my only Truſt, my only Stay, upon Earth. A wretched Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant I am, whoſe whole Wealth is caſt away, ſave thee, thou precious Caſket, thou only Remnant of all my Poſſeſſions! My Girl, indeed, was thy true Lover, the tendereſt of all Mates; her Love to thee, my Son, was paſſing the Love of Woman; but we have loſt her, we have loſt her, and Wailing is all the Portion that is left us below.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Family heard the Voice of our Mourning, they too gave a Looſe to the Impatience of their Griefs, and all the Houſe was filled with the Sound of Lamentation.</p>
               <p>On the following Day I ſummoned the chief medical Artiſts, and got the precious Remains of my Angel embalmed. She was laid under a ſumptuous Canopy with a Silver Coffin at her Bed's Foot, and, every Night when the Houſe was at Reſt, I ſtole ſecretly from my Bed and ſtretched myſelf beſide her. I preſſed her cold Lips to mine. I claſp'd her Corſe to my warm
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0237300103:71"/>Boſom, as though I expected to reſtore it to Life by transfuſing my Soul into it. I ſpoke to her, as when living, I reminded her of the ſeveral tender and endearing Paſſages of our Loves; and I reminded her alſo of the Loſs of our little Ones, by whom we became eſſentially One, inſeparably unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Soul and Body for ever.</p>
               <p>There is ſurely, my Couſin, a Species of Pleaſure in Grief; a Kind of ſoothing and deep Delight that ariſes with the Tears which are puſhed from the Fountain of God in the Soul, from the Charities and Senſibilities of the human Heart divine.</p>
               <p>True, true, my precious Couſin, replied the Counteſs, giving a freſh Looſe to her Tears; O <hi>Matilda,</hi> I would I were with thee! true, my Couſin, I ſay, even now I ſink, I die under the Pleaſure of your Narration.</p>
               <p>Upon the ninth Night, continued Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> as I lay by the Side of all that remained of my <hi>Matty,</hi> overtoiled and overwatched, I fell into a deep Sleep. My Mind notwithſtanding, at the Time, ſeemed more awake and more alive to Objects than ever. In an Inſtant ſhe ſtood viſible and confeſſed before me. I ſaw her clearer than at noon Day, by the Light which ſhe caſt with Profuſion abroad. Every Feature
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0237300103:72"/>and former Trace ſeemed heightened into a Luſtre without a Loſs of the leaſt Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. She ſmiled ineffable Sweetneſs and Bleſſedneſs upon me. And ſtooping down, I felt her Embrace about my Heart and about my Spirit, while, at the ſame Time, I ſaw her bent in Complacence before me. After a Length of ecſtatic Pleaſure, which I felt from her Communion and Infuſion into my Soul; my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays ſhe, grieve not for me; all the Delights that your World could ſum up, in an Age, would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to my Bliſs, no, not for an Hour; it is a Weight of Enjoyment that, in an Inſtant, would cruſh to nothing the whole Frame of your Mortality. Grieve not then for me, my <hi>Harry,</hi> but reſign my beggarly Spoils to their beggarly Parent, Aſhes to Aſhes and Duſt to Duſt! In my inordinate Fondneſs for you, I have at length obtained a Promiſe that my Maſter and your Maſter, my Beloved and your Lover ſhall, finally, bear you triumphant through all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that are ſet in fearful Array againſt you. Having ſo ſaid, I felt myſelf as it were compreſſed within an Engine of Love; and again, loſing the Remembrance of all that had paſſed, I ſunk, as into a State of utter Oblivion.</p>
               <p>Toward the Dawning, I was awakened by the clapping of Hands and the Cries of Lamentation. Starting up, I perceived
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0237300103:73"/>Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> at the Bedſide, ſuſpended over his <hi>Matty</hi> and me, and pouring forth his Complaints.</p>
               <p>There was a favoured Domeſtic of his, a little old Man, who had always kept a careful and inquiſitive Eye over every Thing that was in or concerned our Houſehold, This <hi>Argus,</hi> it ſeems, at length ſuſpected my nightly Viſits to the Dead, and, lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Corner, ſaw me open and enter the Chamber where the Corps was depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As he lay in his Maſter's Apartment, he took the firſt Opportunity of his being awake to impart what he thought a Matter of extraordinary Intelligence to him. Sir, ſays he, if I am not greatly deceived, my young Maſter is this Moment in Bed with his dead Lady. What is this you tell me? cried Mr. <hi>Golding.</hi> No, <hi>John,</hi> no, what you ſay is impoſſible. All who live love that which is living alone; whatever ſavours of Death is deteſtable to all Men. As I am here, replied <hi>John,</hi> I am almoſt aſſured that what I tell you is Fact. Peace, Peace, you old Fool, ſaid Mr. <hi>Golding,</hi> think you that our <hi>Harry</hi> is more loving than Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> deſired to bury his Dead out of his Sight. I know not how that may be, ſaid truſty <hi>John,</hi> but, if you are able to ſtir, I will help you to go and ſee, I am ſure the Thought of it melts the very Heart within me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0237300103:74"/>
Accordingly, Mr. <hi>Golding,</hi> like old <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſtrengthened himſelf and aroſe, and, pained as he was, he came with the Help of his <hi>John</hi> to the Place where I lay.</p>
               <p>Having for ſome Time looked upon me, as I ſlept with his <hi>Matty</hi> faſt folded in my Arms; he could no longer contain his Emotions, but he and <hi>John</hi> broke forth into Tears and Exclamations. O, my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, my Children, my deareſt Children, he cried, why did ye exalt me to ſuch a Pitch of Bleſſedneſs? was it only to caſt me down into the deeper Gulph of Miſery, a Gulph that has neither Bank nor Bottom?</p>
               <p>As I aroſe, all aſhamed to be detected in that Manner, the good Man caught me in his Arms. My <hi>Harry,</hi> my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays he, what ſhall I pay you, my Son, for your ſuperabundant Love to me and to mine? could my Wretchedneſs give you Bliſs, I ſhould almoſt think myſelf bleſs'd in being wretched, my <hi>Harry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I now prepared to execute the late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of my Angel, and to conſign to Earth the little that was earthly in her. But, when our Domeſtics underſtood that all that was left of their loved Miſtreſs was now going to be taken away from them
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0237300103:75"/>for ever, they broke into Tears anew, and ſet no Bounds to their Lamentations.</p>
               <p>Her deſolate Father was deſirous of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Funeral, but, on my Knees, I diſſuaded him from it, as I was aſſured it would burſt in twain the already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched Thread of his Age and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He then inſiſted on having the Lid of the Coffin removed, and bending over, he caſt his old Body on the Corſe; again he roſe and gazed upon it, and clapping his Hands with a Shout, Is this my World, he cried, the Whole of my Poſſeſſions? Are you the one that was once my little prattling <hi>Matty,</hi> the Playfellow of my Knees, the Laugher away of Care, who brought Chear to my Heart and Warmth to my Boſom? Are you the one for whom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, I ſpent my Nights in Thought and my Days in Application? Is this all that is left, then, of my Length of Labours? O, my Spark of Life is quenched; in thee, my <hi>Matty,</hi> my <hi>Matty,</hi> the flowing Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of my Exiſtence is dried up for ever.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething exceedingly ſolemn and affecting, my Couſin, in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Apparatus of our Funerals; they are oppreſſive even to Minds that are no way concerned or intereſted in the Death of the Party lamented. Though I grieved
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0237300103:76"/>no more for my <hi>Matty,</hi> though I was as aſſured of her Bliſs as I was of my own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet, when the Gloom of the Proceſſion was gathered around me, when I heard the Wailings of the many Families whom her Charity had ſuſtained; when I heard the bitter Sobbings of the Servants, whom her Sweetneſs had ſo endearingly attached to her Perſon; when all joined to bewail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as loſt in her Loſs; my Heart died, as it were, within me, and I ſhould have been ſuffocated on the Spot, had I not given inſtant Way to the Swell of my Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</p>
               <p>The Tempeſt of the Soul, Madam, like that of the Elements, can endure but for a Seaſon. The Paſſion of Mr. <hi>Golding,</hi> on the Interment of every Joy and of every Hope that he could look for upon Earth, within a few Weeks ſubſided, or rather ſunk into a ſolid but ſullen Peace, a Kind of Peace that ſeemed to ſay there is nothing in this Univerſe that can diſturb me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harry,</hi> ſaid he, one Evening, I have been thinking of the Viſion that I have had. Viſion, Sir, ſaid I, has my <hi>Matty</hi> then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to you? Yes, he anſwered, ſhe was the principal Part of my Viſion for theſe twenty Years paſt. The Viſion that I mean, my <hi>Harry,</hi> is the Dream of a very
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0237300103:77"/>long and laborious Life. Here have I, by the Toil of fifty Years Application, ſcrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together and accumulated as much as, in theſe Times, would ſet Kings at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and be accounted a worthy Cauſe for ſpilling the Blood of Thouſands; and yet what are theſe Things to me, or of what Value in themſelves, more than the Stones and Rubbiſh that make our Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the Door? I have been hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thirſting after the Goods of this World, I have acquired all that it could give me, and now my Soul, like a ſick Stomach, diſgorges the Whole. I then took one of his Hands, and preſſing it tenderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween mine, O, my Father, I cried, my dear, dear Father, O, that I might be made Sons and Daughters and every Sort of Kindred to you! all that I am and have ſhould gladly be ſpent in bringing any Kind of Comfort to you, my Father!</p>
               <p>In about a Fortnight after, as I enter'd his Apartment to bid him good Morrow, I obſerved that his Countenance had much altered from what it was the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he looked deeply dejected and ſeemed to breathe with difficulty.</p>
               <p>Are not you well, Sir? No, ſays he, my Spirits are greatly oppreſſed. I find that I muſt leave you ſhortly; I believe that I muſt go ſuddenly, but where to? that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0237300103:78"/>is the Queſtion, the very terrible Queſtion; the only Queſtion of any Importance in Heaven or on Earth. Sure, Sir, ſaid I, that can be no Queſtion to you, whoſe whole Life has been a continued Courſe of Righteouſneſs, of daily Worſhip to God, and good Will to all Men. If you have any Sins to account for, they muſt be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered tenfold by the Multitude of your Charities.</p>
               <p>Talk not, <hi>Harry,</hi> ſaid he, of the filthy Rags of my own Righteouſneſs. I am far from the Confidence of the boaſtful Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee; alas, I have not even that of the poor and humbled Publican, for I dare not look up to ſay, <hi>Lord, be merciful to me a Sinner!</hi> wherefore then do you ſpeak of having finiſhed my Courſe toward God and toward Man? It is but lately, very lately that I ſet out upon it, and I am cut ſhort before I I have got within Sight of the Goal. Yes, <hi>Harry,</hi> I fear, I know, I feel that there is no Salvation for me.</p>
               <p>You amaze me, Sir, ſaid I, you terrify me to Death. If there is not Salvation for ſuch as you, what a Depth of Perdition opens for the reſt of Mankind.</p>
               <p>I would you could convince me, he cried, I want to be comforted, I deſire Comfort, any Kind of Conſolation. But
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0237300103:79"/>I feel my Condemnation within myſelf; moreover, I ſee every Text of the Goſpel of the Words of Life terribly marſhalled and ſet in broad Array againſt me. What Text, Sir? ſaid I; I am ſure I know of no Texts that bring Terror or Condemnation to the Juſt. Ah, <hi>Harry,</hi> he replied, Juſtice is of the Law and the Circumciſion, and has nothing to do with the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or the new Man. For, what ſays the great Apoſtle? <hi>Circumciſion availeth nothing, neither Uncircumciſion, but a new Creature.</hi> For Chriſt himſelf had ſaid, <hi>Except a Man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> Again, the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Law of God after the inward Man.</hi> And again, <hi>my little Children of whom I travel in Birth again, until Chriſt be formed in you.</hi> Now, if all theſe correſponding Expreſſions of being <hi>born again,</hi> a <hi>new Creature,</hi> a <hi>new Man,</hi> an <hi>inward Man, Chriſt formed in us,</hi> &amp;c. are to be gloſſed and explained away, as meaning little more than a State of moral Sentiments and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Behaviour, there can be nothing of real Import in the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, hear what the Redeemer ſaith. <hi>Except ye be converted and become as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Again, <hi>If any Man will come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, let him deny himſelf and take up his Croſs and follow me.</hi> Again, <hi>Whoſoever he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0237300103:80"/>be of you that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If theſe Things, I cried, are to be taken according to the apparent Senſe and Import of the Letter, neither the Teachers of the Goſpel, nor thoſe who are taught, can be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Therefore, replied he, it is ſaid that, <hi>Many be called but few choſen.</hi> And again, <hi>Enter ye in at the Strait Gate, for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, and many they be which go in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at: Becauſe ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi> O, my <hi>Harry,</hi> my <hi>Harry,</hi> our Lives have been employed in ſeeking and <hi>loving the World and the Things of the World,</hi> therefore <hi>the Love of the Father could not be in us.</hi> O, that I had never been born! O thou God, whoſe Tribunal, at this Hour, is ſet up ſo tremendouſly againſt me; at length I feel the Propriety of thy Precepts, in rejecting the World and all that is therein, for what can they yield, ſave a little Food and Raiment to bodily Corruption, or Incitements to that Pride which caſt <hi>Lucifer</hi> into a Gulph that now opens before me without a Bottom.</p>
               <p>As I trembled and had nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I propoſed to bring ſome of our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0237300103:81"/>Clergy to him. No, <hi>Harry,</hi> no, ſays he, I will have none of their wordy Comforts, I will not caſt my Soul upon bladder'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. Can they perſuade me that I am one of the Few who are choſen; can they tell me wherein I have ſtriven to enter at the ſtrait Gate, where many ſhall ſeek to enter but ſhall not be able?</p>
               <p>Here he ſunk into a a Fit of agonizing Deſperation, ſo that a cold Dew broke forth from all Parts of his Body, and fell, Drop after Drop, down his ghaſtly and fearful Countenance. Never, Madam, never did I feel ſuch a Kind of anguiſhing Horror as I then felt, I was affrighted and all frozen to my inmoſt Soul. Haſte, my dear Sir, exclaimed Lady <hi>Maitland,</hi> make haſte through this Part of your Narration, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you! I alſo feel for myſelf, I am ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified to the laſt Degree.</p>
               <p>At length, continued Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected myſelf a little. My Maſter, I cried, my Father, my deareſt Father, ſince you will not take Comfort in your own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, take Comfort in that of Him who was made Righteouſneſs for you. Do you not now reject the World, do you not now deny yourſelf? I do, I do, he ſaid, I deteſt the one and the other. And do you not feel that you're wholly a Compound
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0237300103:82"/>of Sin and of Death? Ay, he cried, there is the Weight, there's the Mountain under which I ſink for ever. Come then to Chriſt, my Father, heavy laden as you are, and he will, queſtionleſs, embrace you and be Reſt to you, my Father! I would come, <hi>Harry,</hi> he cried, but I dare not, I am not able. Strive, my Father; do but turn to him, and he will more than meet you. Cry out, with ſinking Peter, <hi>Save, Lord, or I periſh!</hi> and he will catch you with the Hand of his ever ready Salvation.</p>
               <p>Here, his Countenance began to ſettle into an earneſt Compoſure; and his Eyes were turned and fixed upward; while his old and enfeebled Body continued to labour under the Symptoms of near Diſſolution. At length he ſtarted, and, ſeizing my Hand with a dying Preſſure, there is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>Harry,</hi> there is Comfort! he cried, and expired.</p>
               <p>I WAS now caſt, once more, upon a ſtrange and friendleſs World. All the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of my Heart were buried with this Family; and I ſeemed to myſelf, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Kindred or Connections in the Midſt of Mankind. Your dear Mama, indeed, ſometimes called to condole with me, and water my Loſſes with her Tears; and in her, and you, my Couſin, young as you
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0237300103:83"/>then were, was locked up and center'd the whole Stock that I had left of endearing Senſations.</p>
               <p>As the Scenes of my former Happineſs ſerved, daily and nightly, to render me more wretched by a ſad Recollection; I determined to quit my Houſe and to take private Lodgings. For this Purpoſe I ſummoned Mr. <hi>Golding</hi>'s Domeſties, and, as he had made no Will, I firſt paid them their Wages, and then gave them ſuch pretended Legacies as brought their Tears and their Bleſſings in a Shower upon me.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I had diſcharged all, except the two favourite Servants of my Maſter and my <hi>Matty,</hi> I deſired that <hi>John,</hi> our little old Man, ſhould be ſent to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John,</hi> ſaid I, as he enter'd, here is a Bill for five hundred Pounds, which our good old Maſter has left you, in Token of his Acknowledgment of your true and loving Services, and to help, with what you have ſaved, to ſoften and make eaſy the Bed of Death in your old Age. Do you mean to part with me, Sir, ſaid <hi>John,</hi> ſeemingly thankleſs and unconcerned about the Gift which I had offer'd him; Indeed, <hi>John,</hi> ſaid I, in my preſent State of Dejection, Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any Kind would but be an Encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to me. Then, Sir, you may keep
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0237300103:84"/>your Bounty to yourſelf, for I ſhall break my Heart before five and twenty Hours are over. Nay, <hi>John,</hi> ſaid I, I am far from turning you from me; ſtay with me as my Friend and welcome, but not as my Servant, and I ſhall ſee the Comfort of old Times in always ſeeing you about me. Thank you, thank you, Sir, he cried, I will not diſturb you with my Tears; but, I ſhould die unbleſs'd, I ſhould die unbleſs'd, if I died out of your Preſence, ſo ſaying, he ruſhed from me in a Fit of reſtrained Paſſion.</p>
               <p>I then ſent for my Wife's Maid, whom I formerly mentioned. She had juſt heard of my diſcharging the other Servants, and enter'd with a ſad and alarmed Countenance. Come near, Mrs. <hi>Suſan,</hi> I am going to part with you, ſaid I, come to me and give me a farewel Kiſs. She approached with down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt Looks, when, taking her in my Arms, I preſs'd and kiſſed her repeatedly, and ſcarce witheld my Tears. O, my Girl, my <hi>Matty</hi>'s precious Girl, I cried, I am not forgetful of your Love, your Honour, and your Diſintereſtedneſs toward us. Here, my <hi>Suſy,</hi> your darling Miſtreſs preſents you with this Bill of a thouſand Pounds, and, if you chooſe, I will give you Caſh for it within a Quarter of an Hour. This, however, does not diſcharge me from my Regard and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0237300103:85"/>to you; you are of a helpleſs Sex, my <hi>Suſy,</hi> that is ſubject to many Impoſitions and Calamities; wherefore, when this Sum ſhall fail you, come to me again, come to me as to your Friend, as to your Debtor, <hi>Suſy,</hi> and I will repeat my Remembrance, and repeat it again, as you may happen to have Occaſion; for, while I have Sixpence left, the favourite Friend of my <hi>Matty</hi> ſhall not want her Proportion.</p>
               <p>Here, the grateful and amazed Creature threw herſelf on the Floor. She cried aloud, while the Family heard and echoed to her Lamentations. She claſped my Knees, ſhe kiſſed my Feet again and again. I could not diſengage myſelf, I could not force her from me. O, my Maſter, ſhe cried, my all that is left to me of my adored my Angel Miſtreſs, muſt I then be torn from you, muſt you live without the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Hands and Heart of your <hi>Suſy?</hi> But, I underſtand your Regard and Care for me, my Maſter! it is a cruel and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty World, and muſt be complied with.</p>
               <p>Here I compelled her to riſe, and kiſſing her again, I turned haſtily to the Chamber where my <hi>Matty</hi>'s Corps had been laid; and bolting the Door, and caſting myſelf on the Bed, I broke into Tears, and at length wept myſelf to ſleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0237300103:86"/>
While I was preparing to leave the once loved Manſion, I found, in Mr. <hi>Golding</hi>'s Cabinet, a Parchment that much ſurprized me. On my Marriage, he had propoſed to make a Settlement of his Fortune upon me, which, however, I obſtinately refuſed to accept; whereupon, without my Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he got this Deed perfected, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an abſolute Conveyance to me of all his worldly Effects and Poſſeſſions; and this again renewed in me the tender and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Remembrance of each of thoſe Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Benefits which he had formerly conferred upon me.</p>
               <p>I now found myſelf in poſſeſſion of near a Million of Money, which, however, in my Diſpoſition of Mind at the time, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no worthier than ſo much Lumber in a waſte Room. And I know not how it was that through the ſubſequent Courſe of my Life, although I was by no Means of an oeconomical Turn, though I never ſued for a Debt, nor gave a Denial to the Wants of thoſe who aſked, nor turned away from him who deſired to borrow of me, yet uncoveted Wealth came pouring in upon me.</p>
               <p>It was not without ſome Sighs and a plentiful Shower, that I departed from the Seat of all my paſt Enjoyments. I took
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0237300103:87"/>Lodgings within a few Doors of your Father; and my little Houſehold conſiſted of my favourite <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> my little old Man, two Footmen, and an elderly Woman who uſed daily to dreſs a plain Diſh of Meat for us.</p>
               <p>It was then, my faireſt Couſin, that your opening Graces and early Attractions drew me daily to your Houſe; my Heart was ſoothed and my Griefs cheared by the Sweetneſs of your Prattle; and I was melted down and minted anew, as it were, by the unaffected Warmth and Innocence of your Careſſes.</p>
               <p>As I had no Faith in Dreams, not even in that of my <hi>Matty,</hi> I thought it impoſſible that I ſhould ever marry again. I therefore reſolved, in my own Mind, to make you my Heir, and to endow you, in Marriage, with the beſt Part of my Fortune—But, you are a little pale, Madam, you look dejected and fatigued. If you pleaſe, I will ſuſpend my Narration for the preſent; and in the Morning, if you chooſe it, as early as you will, I ſhall renew and proceed in my inſignificant Hiſtory.—Here he preſſed her Hand to his Lips. She withdrew with a tearful Eye and a heaving Heart; and, the next Day, he reſumed his Narration, as followeth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
               <p>THOUGH you, my Couſin, at that Time, were a great Conſolation to me, and a ſweet Lightner of my Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet the Griefs of Heart which I had ſuffered were not without their Effect; at length they fell on my Conſtitution, and affected my Nerves or Spirits; I think our Doctors pretty much confound the One with the Other. Accordingly, I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to travel for Change of Air and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; and I was preparing for my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, when there happened in my Family the moſt extraordinary Inſtance of an ever watchful Providence that occurs to my Memory.</p>
               <p>My little old Man <hi>John</hi> began to decline apace, and at length took to his Bed; and, having a tender Friendſhip for him, I went to ſit beſide him, and to comfort him the beſt I could. <hi>John,</hi> ſaid I, are you afraid to die? No, Sir, not at all, not in the leaſt. I long to be diſſolved and to be with our loving Lord. Indeed, <hi>John,</hi> ſaid I, I am inclined to think you have been a very good Liver. A Dog, Sir, a mere Dog, deſperately wicked, the vileſt of Sinners! I am a Murderer too, my Maſter, there's Blood upon my Head. Blood? ſaid I, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0237300103:89"/>ſtarted. Yes, Sir, replied <hi>John,</hi> but then the Blood that was ſhed for me is ſtronger and more precious than the Blood that was ſhed by me. Blood, however, <hi>John,</hi> is a very terrible Thing; are you not afraid to appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt? By no Means, my dear Maſter, I have long ſince laid the Burden of my Sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, for I had nothing elſe to bring to him, nothing elſe to offer him, and he has accepted them and me, and my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is at Reſt in him. Then, <hi>John,</hi> there may yet be Room for Hope. There is Aſſurance, my Maſter, for I have laid hold upon the Rock, and cannot be ſhaken.</p>
               <p>But how do you intend to diſpoſe of your worldly Subſtance? All that I have, Sir, I got with you and my old Maſter, and, where I found it, even there I reſolve to leave it. Indeed, <hi>John,</hi> I will not finger a Penny of your Money. How much may it amount to? Eight Hundred and Thirty Seven Pounds, Sir, or thereabout. And have you no Relations of your own? Not one living that I know of. Then think of ſome one elſe, for no Part of it ſhall lie on my Conſcience, I aſſure you.</p>
               <p>I have read ſomewhere or other, Sir, of a great King who was adviſed of God, in a Dream, to take the very firſt Man, whom he ſhould meet the next Morning,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0237300103:90"/>to be his Partner in the Government. Now, if it pleaſes you, my Maſter, I will follow the like Counſel, and whoſoever ſhall be firſt found before our Door, let that Perſon be the Owner and Inheritor of my Subſtance! It ſhall be even as you ſay, I will go and ſee whom God ſhall be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſend to us.</p>
               <p>Accordingly I went and opened our Door, when a Woman, who had nearly paſſed, turned about at the Noiſe, and perceiving me, came up and ſaid, a little Charity, Sir, for the ſake of him who had not where to lay his Head!</p>
               <p>I was ſtrongly affected by the Manner in which ſhe addreſſed me, and, eyeing her attentively, I obſerved that ſhe was clean though meanly apparelled; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to make a further Trial whether our Adventure was likely to prove proſperous or not, I ſlipt a Guinea into her Hand, and deſired her to go about her Buſineſs. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſhe courteſied and went from me a few Steps, when, looking into her Hand, ſhe turned ſuddenly back; Sir, Sir, ſays ſhe, here had like to have been a ſad Miſtake, you meant to give me a Shilling, and you have given me a whole Guinea; it was, ſays I, a very great Miſtake, indeed; but, be pleaſed to come in, and we will try to rectify our Errors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0237300103:91"/>
Here, I took her into the Chamber where <hi>John</hi> lay, and, having conſtrained her to ſit down, I put my Hand in my Pocket. Here, good Woman, ſaid I, here are Ten Guineas for you, to make you ſome Amends for the Miſtake I was guilty of in giving you but One. The poor Creature could ſcarcely credit her Senſes, but, raiſing her Eyes in Ecſtacy, and dropping from the Chair upon her Knees, ſhe was proceeding to bleſs me; but I peremptorily inſiſted on her retaking her Seat. Miſtreſs, ſaid I, be pleaſed to ſtay your Prayers for the preſent; what I want from you is the Story of your Life; tell me who and what you are, without ſuppreſſing any Circumſtances, or conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faults of which you have been guilty, and I will make you the Miſtreſs of twenty Guineas, that ſhall be added to what you have already received.</p>
               <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe, you frighten me; my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a very unhappy and a very fooliſh Story, and cannot be of the ſmalleſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to you. Sure, you are too much of the Gentleman to deſire to enſnare me; and, indeed, I know not of any Thing whereby I may be enſnared. Wherefore, bountiful Sir, unto you, as unto Heaven, I will open my whole Soul, without ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0237300103:92"/>to know why you look into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of ſuch a Worm as I am.</p>
               <p>I was the Daughter of a Farmer in Eſſex, my Maiden Name was <hi>Elenor Damer.</hi> I was married, early in Life, to a Man who kept a Chandler's Shop in a little Lane that led to <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> his Name was <hi>Barnaby Tirrell. Barnaby Tirrell?</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>John,</hi> are you very ſure that his Name was <hi>Barnaby Tirrell?</hi> Peace, <hi>John,</hi> I cried, whatever you may know of this Man, or of any other Matter, I command you not to interrupt the Woman till ſhe has finiſhed her Story.—She then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
               <p>I had neither Brother nor Siſter, Sir, but one Brother, a Twin Brother, and we loved one another, as though there was no Body elſe in the World to be loved.</p>
               <p>About three Years before my Marriage, my Brother <hi>Tommy,</hi> then a ſweet pretty Lad, took to a ſeafaring Life, and went from me, I knew not where, upon a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age that I was told was a very great Way off, and ſo I cried, Day and Night, as many Tears after him as would have ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to ſwim in.</p>
               <p>My Huſband was very fond of me, and, when he uſed to ſee me cry, while I ſpoke
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0237300103:93"/>of my <hi>Tommy,</hi> he would kiſs me and try to comfort me, and ſay, that he wiſhed for nothing more than his Return to <hi>Old England,</hi> that he might welcome him and love him as much as I did.</p>
               <p>One Night, on the ninth Month of my Marriage, as I ſat moping and alone, my Huſband being abroad upon ſome Buſineſs, I heard a knocking at the Door, which was opened by our little Servant Girl. And then, before you could ſay this, in leaped my Brother, and catched me faſt in his dear Arms.</p>
               <p>I gave a great Shout for Joy, you may be ſure; and puſhing my <hi>Tommy</hi> from me, and pulling him to me again and again, we embraced, and cried, and kiſſed; and embraced and kiſſed again, as though we never could be tired.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the Door being open, my cruel <hi>Barnaby</hi> entered, unperceived by either of us; and ſeeing a ſtrange Man ſo fond and familiar with me, he opened a long haſped Knife which he had in his Pocket, and ruſhing up, he gave my dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Brother three Stabs in the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could ſpeak a Word or turn about to defend himſelf. Then, caſting down the Knife, in a Minute he was out of the Houſe, and I never ſaw him more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0237300103:94"/>
For a Time, I ſtood like a Stone, and then giving a great Shriek, I fainted and fell on my Brother as he lay weltring in his Blood.</p>
               <p>Our little <hi>Mary,</hi> in the while, being frighted almoſt to Death, ran about like a wild Thing, and alarmed the Street. Our Neighbours crowded in, and ſent for the next Surgeon. My Brother's Wounds were probed and dreſſed, and he was laid in our ſpare Bed.</p>
               <p>Mean time, being forward with Child, I fell into ſtrong and untimely Labour, and after very grievous Travail, was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a Boy, who was chriſtened and called <hi>James,</hi> after my dear and lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Father.</p>
               <p>No Pains of my own, however, kept me from enquiring after that dear and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Brother who had been killed, as I ſuppoſed, for his Love to me. But his Youth and natural Strength carried him through all Dangers. In three Months he was up and about as well as ever. And, in leſs than three more, he ſet out on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Voyage, from whence he never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, O never returned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0237300103:95"/>
Before he went abroad, my dear and ſweet Fellow had left me a Note of Hand for the Receipt of his Wages. But, in five Years after, I heard that he was caſt away, or killed by the Barbary People; and, though I went and went again, in the middle of my Wants, and in the the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of my Sorrows, to aſk and to petition for his Pay from the Admiralty, I never could get an Anſwer of any Profit or any Comfort.</p>
               <p>My little <hi>Jemmy,</hi> however, grew and throve and prated apace, and was my only Prop under all my Afflictions. My Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, indeed, had left me in pretty Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and, had he but ſtayed with me, we ſhould have proſpered above our Fellows. But, what can a Woman do, ſingle, weak, and unprotected? I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by ſome; by others I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Payment for the Goods that I had given, and at length I was reduced to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and obliged to ſhut up Shop.</p>
               <p>Mean time I had ſpared no Coſt on the bringing up of my <hi>Jemmy.</hi> I had given him School Learning, and he now was grown a very towardly and clever Boy. And, having taken to Meſſages, my ſweet Fellow, over Night, uſed to bring to me whatever he had earned in the Day Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0237300103:96"/>
In the Loſs of my Huſband and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in the Loſs of my <hi>Barnaby,</hi> and in the Loſs of my <hi>Tommy,</hi> to be ſure I had Grief upon Grief; ſo that my Health went from me, and next my Strength went from me, and I was not able to work at the waſhing Buſineſs as before. But this didn't ſignify much, while my Child had his Health; for he had now got a Porter's Place in the Cuſtom-houſe, and, young as he was, he willingly carried heavy Burdens to have the Pleaſure of bringing Home his hard Earnings to his Mammy. But, about ſix Weeks ago, may it pleaſe your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, my dear Boy fell ill of a Quartan Ague, as they call it, under which he, and his Mother's Heart ſtill continue to Labour.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſhe had ended her ſhort Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, well, <hi>John,</hi> ſaid I, methinks this Buſineſs will do; in my Opinion you have got a very worthy Inheritor of your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; what ſay you to it, <hi>John?</hi> Firſt, Sir, let me aſk her a Queſtion or two, if you pleaſe. Honeſt Woman, draw your Chair a little nearer to me, I pray you. And now, tell me the Truth; did you ever Love your Huſband? Yes, dearly, indeed, very dearly did I love him; for he had loved me very dearly, till that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Night. But when, as I thought,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0237300103:97"/>he had killed my Brother, I hated him as much as I had ever loved him before. But then again, when my <hi>Tommy</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of his Wounds, I ſent far and near to enquire after him and find him out; and when I could learn no Tidings of him, I put it into all the printed Papers, that <hi>Thomas Damer</hi> was well recovered, and that <hi>Barnabas Tirrel,</hi> who had wounded him, might return, without Danger, to his Wife and Infant.</p>
               <p>And he is returned, ſhouted <hi>John,</hi> he is returned, my <hi>Nelly;</hi> your barbarous and bloody Huſband, who ſtabbed your Brother, and left you and your Infant to famiſh, he is returned to you, my <hi>Nelly!</hi> and, in his Death, he ſhall make you Amends for all the Sufferings which he brought upon you, during his Lifetime. But, my Maſter, my deareſt Maſter, ſend immediately for my Child, my <hi>Jemmy,</hi> I beſeech you, that, bad as I am myſelf, I may give him a Father's Bleſſing before I die!</p>
               <p>I was ſurpriſed and affected, Madam, beyond Expreſſion, by Incidents that were at once ſo wonderful and ſo tender; and I directly ſent Servants and a Sedan-Chair for <hi>James,</hi> with Orders to have him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and warmly wrapt up; for, what his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0237300103:98"/>Mother told me of him had, already, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me a very ſtrong Prejudice in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>Mean while, Mrs. <hi>Tirrel</hi> had ſunk on her Knees by her Huſband's Bed-ſide, and was plentifully pouring forth her Tears upon him; partly for Joy of having found him, and partly for Grief of having found him in that Condition.</p>
               <p>O, my <hi>Nelly,</hi> my <hi>Nelly,</hi> cried <hi>Barnabas,</hi> had I known who the Perſon was whoſe Blood I drew that terrible Night, I would ſooner have thruſt my Knife into my own Heart, than into any Part of the Body of that dear Brother of yours. But I was old and ugly, you know; and you were young and handſome; and Jealouſy is a mad Devil that rages in the Breaſt like Hell-fire; it never knew how to ſpare, but tears and conſumes every thing that comes within its Reach.</p>
               <p>At length <hi>James</hi> was brought to us, and, as we were in his Father's Apartment, a Chamber no way adorned, <hi>James</hi> entered without any Reſpect to Perſons. He was a tall and comely Youth, but very pale and lean, and, as it was one of his well Days, he walked in without Help. He had barely been told that his Mother ſent
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0237300103:99"/>for him in a Hurry; ſo that he enter'd with a viſible Alarm in his Countenance.</p>
               <p>What is the Matter, my dear Mother? ſays he; alas, I am little able to help you at preſent. I hope nothing has happened that is ſuddenly diſtreſsful. Nothing amiſs, my Child, more than that your dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for whom I have ſought and been ſighing this many a Year, your Father lies dangerouſly ill in this very Bed, my <hi>Jemmy.</hi> Am I then ſo bleſs'd, cried the Boy, as to ſee and embrace a Father? O my Child, exclaim'd the old Man, and eagerly ſtretched his Arms toward him, come to my Boſom, thou only Offspring of my Bowels! I may now ſay, with bleſſed <hi>Jacob,</hi> let me die, let me die, ſince I have ſeen thy Face, and thou art alive, my Son!</p>
               <p>I would at any Time give a thouſand Pounds, my Couſin, for a Tenth of the Enjoyment that I then had, in the Feelings which God poured into the Hearts of this little Family, on their ſo very unexpected and marvellous a Meeting. It appeared to me, however, that young <hi>James</hi> even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Parents in Love; and this gave me ſuch a cordial Attachment to him, that from that Hour to this we have never been ſundered. He never failed nor forſook me; and, at this very Day, he is my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0237300103:100"/>Friend, and the Superintendant of my Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Barnabas,</hi> continued to linger, for about a Fortnight longer, and then departed quite happy, and without a Groan. During the ſame Space alſo, <hi>James</hi> was daily attended by my own Phyſician, and was nearly reeſtabliſhed in his Health.</p>
               <p>Being then intent on my Departure, I ſent for Mrs. <hi>Tirrel.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Tirrel,</hi> ſays I, I ſhould be much inclined to take your <hi>James</hi> along with me, if I did not think you would grieve overmuch in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. No, no, Sir, ſaid ſhe, I would to Heaven I were, myſelf, a young Man for your ſake. I deſire no better either of him or for him, than that he ſhould live and die faithfully and lovingly in your Service.</p>
               <p>The next Day I went down the <hi>Thames</hi> in a Barge, partly for Recreation, and partly to ſpeak to the Captain of the Veſſel in which I propoſed to embark. As I drew near to the Cuſtom-houſe Wharf, I obſerved a Wherry, crowded with Men whom ſhe was about to land at the Stairs; and, on Enquiry, I was informed that they were Slaves, whom our Conſul at <hi>Algiers,</hi> by his Interceſſion or Bounty, had ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſent Home.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0237300103:101"/>
Immediately, Compaſſion roſe powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my Boſom. Alas, ſaid I, to myſelf, I ſee that I am not without Companions in Affliction. I, indeed, have now, neither Wife nor Children; nor Father nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor Brother, as I may ſay, nor Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nor any Connection with the World in which I live. I am ſhut out, as it were, from every Enjoyment upon Earth. Let me not however be envious; let me rather wiſh, and give, and diſpenſe Enjoyment to others; ſince, to give Joy to others is all the Joy, in this World, that is left to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Here, I ordered my People to land, and, coming up to the late Captives, My Friends, ſaid I, you are welcome once more to <hi>Old England!</hi> I am fond of hearing Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; You, alſo, may have got your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; and, if you will favour me with your Company, I will order a Dinner for us at yonder Tavern.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you, Madam, that the Parties were ſoon agreed. While a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Dinner was providing, I met Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Bicker,</hi> a City Magiſtrate and an old Acquaintance of mine. Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſaid I, I inſiſt on your dining with me, to Day, at the <hi>Phaenix</hi> there. Perhaps your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions will not appear to you of the moſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0237300103:102"/>honourable Sort. They are, however, good Goſpel Gueſts, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and conſiſt of the Halt, the Lame, the Maim'd, and the Beggar. In ſhort, I have invited all yonder ragged Regiment, being about five and thirty Slaves from <hi>Barbary,</hi> to Dinner; and, after I have filled their Bellies, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give them a hundred Pounds, <hi>per</hi> Man, to help them to begin the World again, and to keep them from being an Incumbrance on their Country.</p>
               <p>Five and thirty hundred Pounds! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Sir <hi>Thomas Bicker,</hi> five and thirty hundred times twenty Shillings of Sterling <hi>Engliſh!</hi> Its well for you, <hi>Harry Clinton,</hi> that old <hi>Golding</hi> was born before you; but nothing can hold you long at this Rate. To whom, again, do you propoſe to give this unmeaſurable Bounty? to the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Public, to Nuiſances and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences againſt Society; to Wretches whom <hi>England</hi> has ſpewed forth from a ſick and debauched Stomach. But, I ſuppoſe you expect to purchaſe extraordinary Glories in Heaven, as the Reward of theſe very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Charities on Earth. No, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſaid I, I ſhall never crave nor look for any Thing, at the Hands of the Son of <hi>David,</hi> ſave only Mercy from him, and Juſtification in him. However, my good Friend, if you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge me with your Company, you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0237300103:103"/>ſhall be Judge of the Merit of the Parties, and I will wholly be guided by your Advice. Then, ſays he, do you ſaunter here a few Minutes; while, in order to open the Hearts of your Gueſts, I go and give them a Priming before Dinner.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had executed his Purpoſe, he came forth, and, beckoning me to him, put his Mouth to my Ear. Don't be offended, ſays he, at ſome free Expreſſions that I may happen to let looſe, in order to encourage theſe Fellows to the like Liberty, and ſhew you what Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal your Companions are made of.</p>
               <p>Dinner was now ſerved up on a Range of joined Tables, and Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> with an eaſy and chearful Familiarity, deſired that they would ſeat themſelves without Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. This many of them did with a Freedom not far from Impudence, while others drew back abaſhed, and begged Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſtand.</p>
               <p>At the Head of the firſt Sort was ſeated a Fellow whoſe firſt Sight gave my Nerves a Thrill of Horror. His Countenance was of that Caſt in which any one would place an implicit Confidence who wanted an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate for any dark, traiterous, or bloody Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0237300103:104"/>
When the Cloth was removed, my Friend puſhed the Bottles about very jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and began to talk as an utter Latitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarian in Morals, whereby he gained the Confidence of every Rogue in Company.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as moſt of them were well warmed, for ſome drank but ſparingly, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> took out his Purſe, and, toſſing a Guinea to each of them, Now, my brave Friends, ſays he, if you deſire any more Favours, you muſt tell me openly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly the jolly Uſe you intend to make of your Money to Night. Why, Maſter, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ill looking Villain, as for me and my ſix Companions here, we have had a long Lent, and a Wench is the Word! That's gallantly ſpoken, cried out Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> here are three Guineas more, apiece, for you Seven. And now, my brave Friends, I ſhall not be backward of another Bounty, if you will give me a ſhort Hiſtory of your Adventures.</p>
               <p>That is ſoon done, my Maſter, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spokeſman. We ſeven were taken Priſoners by an <hi>Algerine Corſair,</hi> after an Engagement in which ſeven and twenty more of us lay in Blood upon Deck. We were ſold to one <hi>Pedro Paolo,</hi> a <hi>Renegade,</hi> who, having been of all Religions in Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom, had at length turned <hi>Turk.</hi> We
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0237300103:105"/>were uſed very ſeverely, and, after ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Day, were made to ſweat Blood at Night with the Stripes which they gave us. However, we were hardy Dogs, and did not matter this very much; when one of their Prieſts came privately to us, and promiſed that, if we would forſake <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and turn to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he would enſure us Liberty and Riches here, and Paradiſe hereafter. Theſe, Sir, as you well know, were very tempting Things. But, as ſoon as our Maſter underſtood that we had complied with the Terms; he hurried us, by Night, into one of his Gallies, where we were chained to the Oar, our Ears were lopped as you ſee, and, at every Meal of Bread and Water, we received ten Laſhes. At length his Honour, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, I forget how they call him, found us out and redeemed us, and ſo you ſee us here.</p>
               <p>Pray, my Friend, ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> are there any more in this Company whom you could recommend to me, as being of the ſame Gallantry of Spirit with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Yes, ſaid he, there are the two <hi>Johns,</hi> and the two <hi>Andrews</hi> yonder, who are none of the Saint <hi>Johns</hi> or Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> I promiſe you. But yonder ſits our Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> a canting Son of a Bitch; he wanted, truly, to preach to us, during our Voyage; and, in the laſt Storm, he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0237300103:106"/>would have perſuaded us, forſooth, to join with him in Prayer. Here then, cried Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> you two no Saint <hi>Johns,</hi> and you two no Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> here are three Pieces a Man for you alſo; and that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I hope, Gentlemen, will be ſufficient to maintain you in Gaol, till we can hear a better Account of you. Ho, Drawer! are the People I ſent for in Waiting? They are, pleaſe your Honour. Deſire them to ſtep in.</p>
               <p>Here entered a Serjeant at Mace with a great Poſſe of Conſtables. Serjeant, ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> take theſe ſeven and theſe four into your Cuſtody, and keep them in cloſe Durance till you hear further from me; I would rather open the Tower Cages, and let all the wild Beaſts abroad through the Streets, than looſe ſuch Reprobates as theſe among Mankind.</p>
               <p>At this Inſtant, as a Conſtable was lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on our gallant Spokeſman, he ſuddenly drew an Inſtrument that was half Knife and half Dagger, and leaping acroſs me, he caught Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> by the Throat, and raiſing his Arm, would have plunged the Steel into his Boſom; but, at the ſame Moment, I ſeized his Hand, and throwing up his Heels, I caſt him on his Back, and wrenched the Weapon from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0237300103:107"/>
As ſoon as we were thus rid of eleven of our Gueſts, a young Man came earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to us: Gentlemen, ſays he, till thoſe ſeven Hell-hounds were ſecured, I did not dare to open my Mouth. I know them all right well, and, had they known me, there is not one of them but would have thruſt his Knife into my Heart.</p>
               <p>About eleven Years ago, I was taken as cabbin Boy, when they, with many more, were taken as Sailors on Board the good Ship <hi>Saint Catharine,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Tomſon,</hi> Maſter, bound for the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> As ſoon as we came along ſide the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> this big Villain, <hi>Patrick Mc. Douel,</hi> prevailed on moſt of the Crew to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Conſpiracy, whereupon they barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and ſportingly murdered the Maſter, the Officers, and all who were not of their own Gang, except myſelf, being then about ten Years of Age. But they did not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per long, for, the very next Morning, we were held in Chaſe, and then they wiſhed for the Help of thoſe Hands whom they had cut off. So, as <hi>Mc. Douel</hi> told you, after a very bloody Battle, we were board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken, and thoſe ſeven Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were ſold to one Maſter; and, well as it happened for me, I was ſold to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and all this and more, I am ready to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0237300103:108"/>witneſs in any Court, provided I am kept ſafe from the Clutches of thoſe Devils.</p>
               <p>Ay, exclaimed Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> theſe are your Charities, Mr. <hi>Clinton;</hi> and ſuch the Objects of whom your Judgment has made Choice. Ah, my Friend, I replied, that Charity muſt be very tardy, which waits to be aſſured of the Merit of its Object. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf cured ten Lepers, while he knew that nine of them were unworthy of his Graciouſneſs.</p>
               <p>On the Entrance of the Conſtables, I had caſt my Eye round the Room, and remarked that moſt of our Meſs-mates ſeemed much alarmed, and turned pale on the Caption of their late Comrades, which rendered their Characters, alſo, ſomewhat ſuſpected to me. Wherefore, leſt I ſhould caſt my Seed on a wholly barren Soil, I wiſhed to get ſome further Intelligence concerning them. Where, ſaid I, is the Perſon whom they call Saint <hi>Thomas?</hi> I deſire a few Words with him.</p>
               <p>Here a Man approached, reſpectfully, from the farther End of the Table, to which, through Modeſty, he had retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his few Companions. Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſaid I, looking earneſtly at him, have I not ſeen your Face before? No, pleaſe your Honour, I think that muſt be impoſſible.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0237300103:109"/>It is now upon eighteen Years ſince I ſet a Foot in this Kingdom, and your Honour, muſt then have been but as a Child. Do you know any Thing, Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> of theſe People or their Affairs? Nothing of their Affairs, Sir, and little more of their Perſons, than that they are, all, Men of very profane Lips; except the Lad who ſpoke to you laſt, and my five Meſs-mates yonder, the only People who, during our long and dangerous Voyage, would return Thanks to God for any of his Mercies, or pray him to avert his juſt Judgments from them.</p>
               <p>Then, ſaid I, we will proceed between Extremes. On the one Side, we will not miniſter Fewel to the Luſts of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Creatures: neither will we leave them to periſh; or tempt them, through Want, to Robbery, on the other Side. Here, Landlady, take this Bill. Give twenty Pounds to each of theſe ſeventeen Fellows, and, if any of them, within a Month, ſhall bring you a Certificate of his good Behaviour, give him twenty Pounds more. Now, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> I may hope, that I do not exceed your good Pleaſure. Not much, <hi>Harry,</hi> not much, in Time you may be tractable.</p>
               <p>Here the poor Wretches looked amazed, and ſcarce crediting the Reality of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0237300103:110"/>Bounty that was ordered for them, they cried, thank your Honours, thank your Honours! and withdrew. One of them, however, ſeemed to linger after the reſt, and, going out laſt, he returned again quickly, and threw himſelf at my Feet. I am a Reprobate, Sir, a mere Reprobate, he cried, and am not worthy of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Does your Conſcience condemn you then, ſaid I? It does, Sir, it does. Then I condemn you not; riſe, riſe, and give me your Hand, my Brother!</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> now that I have kept you from caſting ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on the Quickſands, you can afford to be the more generous to theſe worthy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. You will allow me then, ſaid I, to order our Landlady to pay them a hundred Pounds apiece. With all my Heart, ſays he, and if you will be ſo honeſt as to reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe me the ſixty or ſeventy Pieces, which I threw away, for your Uſe, upon the other Villains, I will add ſomething to that, alſo, and divide it among them.</p>
               <p>Then, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> if you will indulge me with your Company for an Hour or two longer, let us ſend for an Undertaker to put our Friends here in decent Apparel; while we liſten to what they ſhall be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tell us of their Fortunes. Agreed,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0237300103:111"/>
                  <hi>Harry,</hi> agreed. So, let us reſume our Seats, and have the other Bottle.</p>
               <p>Miſter <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſaid I, pray what may be your Sirname? <hi>Damer,</hi> Sir. <hi>Damer, Damer!</hi> have you any Relations in this Kingdom? Alas, Sir, I fear not; my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Chriſtopher Damer</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> died a little before I ſet out on my laſt Voyage. And had you no Relation beſide? O, Sir, that is it, which brought the Tears ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into my Eyes! I had a Siſter, an only Siſter, a Siſter that I loved dearer than Health or Safety. But — I fear — I fear — here his Speech was ſtopped by his Emotion; while I was ready to leap up and catch him in my Arms; but I ſuppreſs'd my Inclinations, for the preſent, that I might heighten the Surprize and Pleaſure which I foreſaw there would be at the Meeting of the Twins.</p>
               <p>While all Materials were providing, from the ſeveral Ware Houſes, for the Cloathing and Accommodation of our Gueſts; they, ſucceſſively, gave us an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of their reſpective Lives and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherein were many Incidents ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely intereſting and entertaining. Let us have them, let us have them, by all Means! cried Lady <hi>Maitland.</hi> My dear Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> were I to relate to you the ſeveral affecting Stories that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0237300103:112"/>occurred to me, throughout my Travels, from Priſons, from the Depth of Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; from Captives, and from Perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from Captivity; from Wretches wrecked at Sea, or wrecked by Fortune; from thoſe who ſurvived the Calamities of Warfare and Famine, I ſhould never make an End.</p>
               <p>But then, ſaid the Counteſs, the poor Creature who felt ſo ſudden and affecting a Compunction; I have a Friendſhip for that Fellow, and I am deeply intereſted in all the Concerns of my Friend, I muſt tell you. Well, Madam, you ſhall have his Story, then, as nearly as I can recollect at this Diſtance of Time.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. The HISTORY of a REPROBATE.</head>
               <p>I Know not, Gentlemen, ſaid he, who my Parents were. I was found, when an Infant, wrapped in Rags on a Cobler's Bulk, in <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The Wardens ſent me to the Pariſh Nurſery for Foundlings; and, when I was capable of Inſtruction, they ſent me to the Charity-School.</p>
               <p>When I had learned to read and write, I was bound, a Servant Apprentice, to Mr. <hi>Skinner,</hi> a neighbouring Attorney. My Miſtreſs grew fond of me; ſhe was a very holy Woman; ſhe taught me my Prayers and Catechiſe, and made me read to her every Night, and repeat Chapters and Pſalms, till I had nearly got Half the Bible by rote.</p>
               <p>As my Maſter uſed to ſend me on many Errands and Meſſages, and to entruſt me with little Matters of Money on ſuch Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, on finding me always punctual and honeſt to him, he began to love me almoſt as much as my good Miſtreſs did.</p>
               <p>But now came on my firſt falling away from all Goodneſs. I was about twelve
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0237300103:114"/>Years old, when, in a curſed Hour, my Maſter ſent me to a diſtant Part of the Town, with a Bill to pay ſome Money, and to bring him back the Change. The Change amounted to about four Pounds in glittering Silver. It appeared a Mint of Money. I had never been in Poſſeſſion of ſo large a Heap; and I ſighed, and ſaid to myſelf, how bleſſed muſt they be who are become the rich Owners of ſo much Money. Then, ſome one ſeemed to whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per me that I was the Owner; and again ſome one ſeemed to whiſper me that I was not the Owner. Then, I would go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward my Maſter; and again I would ſtop and go aſide. Then, I would thruſt my Hand into my Pocket, and feel the Greatneſs of my Treaſure, then turn to the Wall, and lay the Brightneſs of it before my Eyes. Then I would run a Piece off, as hurried away by the Force of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and again, I would delay, and ſtop, and turn, and ſtrive to force myſelf home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Till, what with doubting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying, and ſtruggling off and on, and going backward and forward, I conſidered that, if I went home, I ſhould now get nothing but Blame and Beating, and ſo I took a head, and ran into the Country as faſt as my Feet could carry me.</p>
               <p>As I ran myſelf out of Breath, from time to time, I would look back and look
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0237300103:115"/>back, and run on and run on, in the Thought that my Maſter, or ſome one from him, was at my Heels. But, often ſince, I have reflected and was perſuaded in my Mind, that my kind Maſter and Miſtreſs had not the leaſt Suſpicion of me, but rather enquired and ſorrowed after me, as being murdered or kidnapped from them, and this alſo was, at times, a great Grief of Heart to me.</p>
               <p>When I was quite tired and jaded, and Night came on, I turned up to a Carrier's Inn, where was written <hi>dry Lodgings</hi> over the Door. But, as I feared every thing, I had the Cunning to conceal my Treaſure, and taking a Penny from my Pocket, I begged the Woman of the Houſe, for that and Charity's Sake, to give me a little Bread and Milk, and ſome Hole to lie in.</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed my Supper, I was ſhewn to a kind of Hovel that lay under the Stairs, where, throwing myſelf on ſome Straw, with a Piece of a Blanket over me, I fell faſt as a Rock. Awakening, however, about Midnight, or ſomewhat after, and ſeeing all dark about me, and no Creature near Hand; I began to tremble greatly; and then I wiſhed to ſay my Prayers, but I did not dare to pray; and ſo I lay ſweating and trembling, and trembling and ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0237300103:116"/>till the Dawning of the Day brought ſome Relief to my Spirits.</p>
               <p>Having breakfaſted at the Coſt of a ſecond Penny, I ſet out, though not with my former Speed; for, reflecting that I had not my Livery on, but a ſmall Frock Coat, I was under the leſs Fear of being known. However, I puſhed on as well as I was able, wanting ſtill to get as far from Danger as poſſible. And, indeed, I hoped, by going on ſtill further and further, to get away from my own Fears and from my own Conſcience.</p>
               <p>O Gentlemen, what Miſery did I not endure, at that Seaſon! the Truſt I had in my Treaſure began now to abate, the Dread of loſing it alſo brought new Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles upon me; Peace was baniſhed from within me; and without, there was no Place whereto I might fly for Reſt.</p>
               <p>On the fifth Morning of my Travels, having expended what Halfpence and ſmall Silver I had; I took out Half a Crown, and offered it to the Man of the Houſe, deſiring him to return what was over the Reckoning. As he took it, he gave me a Look that I thought went through me, and continuing to ſtare me in the Face, he ſhamed me ſo, that I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to turn aſide. He gave me the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0237300103:117"/>Change, however, and I ſet forward on my Journey, all trembling and apprehending I knew not what.</p>
               <p>I had not gone above a Mile, when, meeting a dirty Road, I turned over a Stile that led to a Path through the Fields. Here I walked on a Piece, when, turning, I ſaw my Landlord making long Strides after me, whereupon my Heart beat, and my Knees grew ſo weak under me that I ſtood as ſtill as a Stone.</p>
               <p>He came quickly up with me, and, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me by the Neck, he caſt me on my Back. Ha! you young Rogue, ſays he, let us ſee what Money you have got. Then, diving into my Pockets, he pulled out the whole Stock in which I truſted for Happineſs. O, you little Dog of a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, from whom have you ſtollen all this Treaſure? but, I muſt go and return it to the right Owner. O, good Sir, good Sir, I roared out, will you not leave me a little? ever ſo little, dear Sir, to keep me from ſtarving? but he was deaf to my Cries and Prayers, and away he went.</p>
               <p>Hope, the laſt Comfort of the Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, now forſook me. I curſed, at my Heart, the Day in which I was born; and I lay a long Time, as one who had no Uſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0237300103:118"/>for Limbs, nor any further Way to travel upon Earth. At length I broke into Shouts and a great Guſh of Tears; and having got ſome Eaſe by venting my Sorrows, I roſe, by a Kind of Inſtinct, and went on I knew not whither.</p>
               <p>Growing hungry after Noon, I would willingly have begged the Charity of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, but this I did not dare to do, for fear they ſhould aſk me whence I came, and who I was, and whereto I was going, Queſtions to which I could give no very honeſt Anſwer. So, I bore my Hunger as well as I could, till coming over Night to a Hovel where a Farmer kept his Pigs, I made way for myſelf among them, and ſlept in the Straw till Morning.</p>
               <p>The Day following, as I paſſed ſlowly and half famiſhed through a ſmall Village, my Eye catched at a Penny Loaf that lay on a little Shop Window which jutted into the Street. I looked here and there, and peered into the Shop, and was juſt going to ſeize the ready and tempting Spoil; when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whiſpered, at my Heart, don't touch it for your Life, ſtarve, ſtarve, rather than offer to ſteal any more, and ſo I tore my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf away, and, running as faſt as I could, for fear of turning back, I at laſt got clear off from the Reach of this Temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0237300103:119"/>
When I had travelled ſomething fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I got into an encloſed Country, where there were Hedges on every Side, with Plenty of Haws and Bramble Berries on every Buſh. And here I filled my Belly with Berries to ſerve me for Dinner; and I ſtuffed my Pockets with Haws againſt I ſhould want. Upon this I grew wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful glad that I had not taken the Loaf; and Peace again began to come upon my Mind; and, about Night-fall, having reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Copſe on one Side of the Road, I crept, like a Hare, under the Shelter of the Buſhes; I then ſupped upon my Haws, after which I kneeled down and half ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured at a Prayer to God; and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in my Form, I ſlept happily till Morning.</p>
               <p>Having lived thus for ſome Days, I came into an open Country, where there was ſcarce any Path, nor any Haw or Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry within many a Mile. I now began to grow ſick and faint with Hunger; and again my Sickneſs went off, and I became ſo greedy and ravenous that I was ready to eat my own Fleſh from the Bones. Soon after, I ſpied, at a Diſtance, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Heap of ſomething at the Root of a great Tree that grew in the open Fields. I made up to it in Expectation of I knew not what, and found an old Beggarman
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0237300103:120"/>faſt aſleep in his patched Cloak, with a Bundle of ſomewhat lying beſide him.</p>
               <p>Inſtantly I opened his little Baggage, when, to my inexpreſſible Tranſport, a large Luncheon of brown Bread, with ſome Half-pence, ſtruck my Eyes. I did not heſitate a Moment about ſeizing the Bread, for I could no more withſtand the Cravings of my Appetite, at the time, than I could withſtand a Torrent ruſhing down a Hill. Having appeaſed my Stomach, I began to demur about what I ſhould do with the Remainder of the Bread, and felt a Motion or two inclining me to leave it behind me. But, no, ſaid I to myſelf, this is all the Bread that I have, or may ever have during Life, and I know not where to get a Bit in the whole World; beſide, I do this Man no Harm in taking it away, ſince I leave him Money enough wherewith to buy more. So I put the Bread in my Pocket, and went on my Way, leaving behind me about four or five Pence in the Wrapper.</p>
               <p>I had not gone far, however, before I ſaid to myſelf again, this Man is a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar by Trade, and gets Halfpence from every Paſſenger that goes the Road. But alas, no one living has any Pity upon me, and ſo, to ſtarve alive, or take the Money, is all the Queſtion. So ſaying or ſo think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0237300103:121"/>I went back on Tiptoes, and ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſeizing my Prey, I flew away like Lightening.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I had got out of the Reach and Sight of the poor Man, the firſt Motion I felt was the Joy of having ſuch a Prize; but I had not gone far till this Joy was much abated, my Sighs began to heave, and my Tears to flow apace.</p>
               <p>That Night, I took up my Lodging in a little waſte Cabin that lay a Piece off the Road. But though, as I thought, I had Plenty of Bread, and Money enough about me, yet I found myſelf exceeding heavy, and I was not able to pray, as I did the foregoing Nights.</p>
               <p>During all this time, I neither knew where I was, nor whereto I was going, nor any thing more of my Travels than that I came from <hi>London.</hi> When I had ſpent to my laſt Penny, and was walking, ſlow and melancholy, on a By-path that led through ſome woody Lawns, I heard the Voice of Merriment, and, quickly after, perceived a Group of Gipſies that came from behind ſome Trees.</p>
               <p>As I ſaw that I could not eſcape them, I gather'd Courage and went forward, when coming up, they ſtopped and eyed me
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0237300103:122"/>with much Attention, and made a Ring about me. Where are you going, my Child, ſays a Man with a broad Girdle and a very formidable Beard? Indeed, Sir, ſaid I, I cannot tell. And where did you come from then? From <hi>London,</hi> Sir, ſo pleaſe you. From <hi>London,</hi> Child? why that is a very great Way off. And pray what made you leave <hi>London?</hi> To get away from my Maſter. But, I hope you did not come away empty, you brought ſomething from him, didn't you? Some little Matter, good Sir, but I was robbed of it on the Way. Hereupon, this venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Regent ſmiled, and turning to his Dependents, as far as I ſee, ſaid he, this Chap will anſwer our Purpoſes to a Hair.</p>
               <p>Here, one of the Females aſked if I was hungry, and, on my Anſwer in the affirmative, they all invited me with a jovial Air to Dinner. We then turned a Diſtance off from the Path wherein we had met, and gradually deſcended into one of the pleaſanteſt Spots in the World. It was a Dell ſurrounded with Hills, ſome of which were ſlanting, ſome headlong and impending, and all cover'd or ſpotted with Groups of Trees, of different Heights, Sorts, and Colours; through which there deſcended a gurgling Rivulet, which, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rolled over Stones and Pebbles, grew
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0237300103:123"/>ſilent in a ſmall Lake, that reflected the circling Objects from the Vale below.</p>
               <p>Immediately, Nature's Carpet was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a large Cloth of fine damaſked Linen. The Baggage was taken from the Shoulders of the Bearers; and, before I could take note of what they were about, there was ſpread, as by Art magic, before my Eyes, the moſt various and ſumptuous Banquet I had ever beheld. Down, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, ſunk the Gueſts; ſome ſitting, like the <hi>Turks,</hi> croſslegg'd; while others lolled, like the <hi>Romans,</hi> along ſide of each other.</p>
               <p>As they had travelled far that Day, they all eat in Silence; and, in a ſhort Space, the Burden of the Luggage-carriers was pretty much lightened. In the mean time, ſome aroſe, and unladed two Aſſes of the Creels which they carried. The Cloth then was quickly emptied of the cold Fowls and baked Meats, with the Loins of Beef and Mutton; and leathern Jacks, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Plenty of the beſt Wines and other Liquors, were ſet before us. Theſe, again, were decanted into clean japanned Pitchers; and a japanned Cup, of equal Meaſure, was given into every Hand.</p>
               <p>Then began Mirth and Jollity to flow round with the Cups; never did I ſee
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0237300103:124"/>ſo pleaſant, ſo gleeful a Company. Joke and Banter, without Offence, were bandied from every Side; and Burſts of Laughter were echoed from the anſwering Hills.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I was warmed and my Heart opened by what I drank, they all expreſſed a Liking and Kindneſs for me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that I would tell them my Story, without Diſguiſe. Accordingly, I made an ingenuous Confeſſion of all the Matters related. But, inſtead of meeting thoſe Reproofs which I expected for my Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, they jointly began to ridicule my Scruples, and put to ſhame the little Shame that I had of my evil Deeds.</p>
               <p>My Child, ſaid their ancient Governor, when you have been a ſufficient time with us, you will then learn what it is to be wiſe and to be happy. You will then know that Religion is nothing but Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy or Faſhion. There are Thouſands and ten Thouſands of Religions upon Earth, all contrary, and fighting the one againſt the other. People pretend to fear God, when it is the Fear of the Laws, alone, that is before their Eyes. God is not to be feared but to be loved, my Son, for he is a very gracious and a bountiful God: He gave the Heavens, in common, to the Birds of the Air. He gave the Seas and Rivers, alſo, in common to the Fiſhes.

                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0237300103:127"/>And he gave this whole Earth in common to Mankind. But, great People and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Power have ſeized it all to themſelves, and they have made to themſelves Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Properties by Fences and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures; and they have again encloſed thoſe Encloſures by Laws of their own making, whereby the Poor are to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they attempt to reclaim any Part of the natural Rights with which God had gifted them. But, when the Poor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear of the Laws, can gain any thing from the Rich and the Mighty who have robbed them of their Rights, they may ſurely do it with a ſafe and an honeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And now, know, my Child, that you are come among thoſe who, of all People can beſt defend you and make you happy. We are of that Sort of the Poor who are above the Rich and the Mighty, by being above the Laws; for they can frame no Laws which are of any more Force to us than the Web of a Spider.</p>
               <p>So ſpoke this formidable Sage; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Gentlemen, however ſtrange it may ſeem, I ſaw the latter Part of his Aſſertion fully verified by Practice. I continued among this very ſingular and wonderful People, near the Space of three Years; during which time they initiated me into all the Arts and Myſteries of their manifold Iniquities. No Fetters could hold them;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0237300103:128"/>no Priſons could contain them; no Bolts or Locks could ſecure the Treaſures of the Wealthy from them. By the means of Spells or certain Odours, as it were by Enchantment, all Beaſts became ſubject to them; the wildeſt Horſe would ſtand for them; the fierceſt Maſtiffs did not dare to bay or growl at them; ſo that all Bleach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens, Yards, and Gardens were as open to their Invaſion as the Highway. They aſſumed all Sorts of Shapes, and almoſt all Sorts of Sizes. They became viſible and inviſible, known or unknown at Pleaſure; for every different Dreſs they had a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Countenance and Set of Features; ſo that their daily Intimates could not know them, except by appointed Words or Tokens. And thus, without Violence or apparent Fraud, without Buſtle, Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Accuſation on any Side, they over-ruled the Government, and held, as it were, the Purſes of the whole Nation in their Hands.</p>
               <p>You will wonder, Gentlemen, by what Policy theſe People could maintain their Influence and Depredations, undetected, throughout the Kingdom. I will account for this Matter as clearly and as briefly as I can.</p>
               <p>Though they never appeared, by Day, except ſingle or in ſmall Parties of ten or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0237300103:129"/>fifteen at moſt, yet they kept their State entire, by quick and conſtant Intelligence. Beſide, their Prince or principal Potentate, who was the Perſon that firſt accoſted me, they had a deputy Governor for every Shire; and, in every Pariſh, they had a Houſe of common Uſe and common Reſort to the Fraternity. Here their Victuals were dreſſed and their Proviſions laid in; and here alſo were depoſited the Spoils of the Public, which, when converted into Money, was locked in a ſtrong Box, one tenth for the uſe of the Society on any Emergence, and the other nine for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Spoilers, in Proportion to their reſpective Ranks and Merits.</p>
               <p>Before we roſe from our late mentioned Feſtival, an ancient female Fortune-teller chucked me under the Chin and ſaid, do you know, my Dear, where this ſame kind Landlord lives who robbed you of your Money? All I know, ſaid I, is that he lives in a little Town at the Sign of a white Croſs, and near to a great Windmill. What, cried one of the Men, my old Hoſt <hi>Jerry Gruff?</hi> he hates that any, except him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhould proſper by their Ingenuity. I owe that Fellow a Fling, cried another, for once attempting to circumvent me in his own Houſe. Well, my Lad, ſays <hi>Geoffry,</hi> the old Governor, his Houſe lies directly in the Way of our Circuit, and, for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0237300103:130"/>your Encouragement, I promiſe you that he ſhall refund you every Penny of the Money he took from you.</p>
               <p>The Luggage being now up, we ſet back on the Field Path by which I came; and, coming to a great Road, we divided into ſmall Parties, who were appointed to meet at the Pariſh-houſe, where we ſupped merrily and ſlept ſoundly for that Night.</p>
               <p>We ſet out, the next Morning, by Dawn of Day, and entering ſoon after upon a Common, we ſaw a Parcel of Horſes feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a Keeper. Immediately, three of the likelieſt were taken from the reſt. Out came Sciſſars and other Implements, with Phials of colouring Eſſences, and to work went many Hands, when, in leſs than five Minutes, had the Owners come up, they could not have found a ſingle Mark of their own Property upon them. And, indeed, I have frequently known ſome of thoſe, my ingenious Brotherhood, ſo very audacious as to ſell, in public Marker, the Cattle, which they had ſtolen, to the very Perſons from whom they were taken.</p>
               <p>As theſe People were never unprovided of their Conveniences, the Horſes were quickly bridled and diſpatched, by ſeveral Emiſſaries, ſeveral Ways, to ſummon the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0237300103:131"/>neighbouring Brotherhood, on the third Night, to meet near the white Croſs with their appointed Apparatus.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, on the Evening of the Night required, we arrived on a little Hill that ſtood oppoſite to the Houſe of my conſcientious Landlord; and, ſoon after, we were joined by ſeveral Parties, from ſeveral Sides, amounting to about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Perſons, with Parcels of I knew not what upon Aſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Packs were quickly opened, and from thence were produced black and flame coloured Gowns, Flambeaux, Hoofs, and Horns, and Vizards of horrid Aſpect and terrific Dimenſion. In a Hurry, we were all fitted with our reſpective Dreſſes and Characters. A large paſteboard Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin was covered with a white Sheet, and exalted upon the Shoulders of four fiery Devils; and, as Night began to fall dark and heavy upon us, a Light was ſtruck, the Flams were lighted, one was put into every right Hand; ſpeaking Trumpets, with other Inſtruments of heart-ſinking Sounds, were put to many a Mouth, and we directly ſet out on our diabolical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Some roared like Bulls, others houled and bayed like Dogs at a midnight Moon, while others yelled articulately in the catterwawling Gibberiſh; in ſhort, the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0237300103:132"/>Sounds made ſuch a Complication of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors as no mortal Ears could abide, nor mortal Courage ſupport.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Town took the Alarm and began to be in Commotion. Old and young quitted their Houſes, and hurried hither and thither through the Street. But, as we advanced, they made back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and running, or climbing, or ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling up Hill, they gathered all in a Body before the Windmill. In the Interim, we puſhed forward, and entered the Inn, where neither Cat nor Dog, nor living Creature was left, ſave Goodman <hi>Gruff,</hi> who lay impotent, of the Gout, in an upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>While moſt of the Company ſtaid, rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſearching the Houſe below, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Geoffry</hi> led a few of us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up Stairs. He repreſented the Perſon of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> whoſe Name was impreſſed in flaming Characters on his Cap. On entering the Room where Landlord <hi>Gruff</hi> lay, Hark ye, <hi>Jerry,</hi> ſays <hi>Lucifer,</hi> you ſneaking Thief, you mean petty-larceny Villain! how came you to rob a Child, the other Day, of the Money which he gained under my Influence and Encouragement? I have a mind, you Scoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel, to ſtrike you out of my Liſt of Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers. O, my good Lord <hi>Lucifer,</hi> cries <hi>Gruff,</hi> with a trembling Voice, in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0237300103:133"/>now, I did not think that any kind of Robbery would be an Offence to your Honour. You lie, you Raſcal, you lie, cries <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the Devil is a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he loves thoſe who rob the Great, who have robbed the Little; but he hates your low ſpirited Scoundrels, who rob the Widow, and the Fatherleſs, and take from the little Ones the little that they have. Why, pray, my Lord <hi>Lucifer,</hi> are you a Chriſtian, cries <hi>Gruff?</hi> A better one, Raſcal, than you or any of your Tribe; for, though I tremble, yet I believe. And I tell thee, <hi>Jerry,</hi> that I will make this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to tremble; but, as I think, the Devil himſelf cannot bring them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p>During this Confabulation, the whole Houſe, Drawers and all, was gutted as clean as a Fowl for Supper. So, without entering into any other Habitation, away we marched as in our former tremendous Proceſſion; till, coming to ſome ſtanding Water, we halted, and, at a given Word, we altogether plunged our Torches in the Pool, and inſtant Night fell upon all the World.</p>
               <p>Thus, from Day to Day, and Year to Year, while I continued with this People, I was witneſs to a Variety of Slights, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, Impoſtures, Metamorphoſes, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0237300103:134"/>Depredations, without any Inſtance of their being brought to condign Puniſhment. One of them, however, within my Time, was detected, taken, impriſoned, brought to the Bar, tried, and brought in guilty; and yet found Means to evade Juſtice by the moſt marvellous Piece of Stratagem that ever was.</p>
               <p>He was ſpied in the Act of ſtealing a bay Horſe. Freſh Suit was made. He was ſeized and loaded with Irons in the Dungeon of the County Gaol. On the Day of Trial the Fact was proved by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable Witneſſes; and the Jury, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quitting the Box, pronounced the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Word, <hi>Guilty.</hi> Have you any thing to ſay, cried the Judge, why Sentence of Death ſhould not be pronounced againſt you? I can truly affirm, exclaimed the Culprit, that I am as clear as the Light, of this Matter; that the Beaſt which I took, then was, and, to this Hour, is my own Property; and that there muſt be ſome wonderful Miſtake in this Buſineſs; wherefore, my Lord, as I am upon Life and Death, I truſt that your charitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence will order this ſame Horſe to be brought into Court. The Horſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly was brought, and the Culprit continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Now, my Lord, be pleaſed to order the Witneſſes to ſay whether this be the ſame Horſe that I ſtole or not? The ſame, the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0237300103:135"/>ſame, cried the Witneſſes, by Virtue of our Oaths. Be ſo good then, my Lord, to aſk them of what Age this Horſe was, at the Time that I ſtole him? By Virtue of the ſame Oath, four Years old riſing five. Now, my Lord, if you will continue your gracious Indulgence, be pleaſed to order his Mouth to be examined by ſome People ſkilled in ſuch Matters. This alſo was done by two or three Jockeys, of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Judgment, who inſtantly cried out, why, my Lord, this Horſe is quite paſſed Mark of Mouth.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, every Perſon that was preſent looked aſtoniſhed, and Silence was in Court for ſome Minutes; till the Culprit reſumed. There is but one Requeſt more with which I ſhall trouble your Lordſhip; it is, that you would be pleaſed to ſend and examine whether this ſame Horſe be a Horſe or a Mare. This laſtly was done, when the Examiners cried out, a Mare, my Lord, a Mare, without any Queſtion!</p>
               <p>Here, the Surprize and Amazement of the Court was redoubled. The Jury look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down abaſhed; the Witneſſes ſlunk away in utter Shame and Confuſion; and his Lordſhip inſtantly ordered that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſhould be diſmiſſed without Fees, and that the Mare ſhould be reſtored to him as his proper Goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0237300103:136"/>
Now, the whole Myſtery of the Affair was merely this, that ſome of the Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the very Night before the Trial, had picked the Lock of the Stable, and, in the Place of the Horſe, had ſubſtituted this Mare, whom they found or formed to ſo perfect a Reſemblance of him, that no Eye could diſcern the ſmalleſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction.</p>
               <p>During my Sojourn with theſe Wretches, may it pleaſe your Honours, I found by dear Experience, that, between the Birth and the Grave, there are but two Sorts of Happineſs, of which Man is capable. The one is, that of a <hi>Conſcience void of giving Offence;</hi> the other is, that of a <hi>Conſcience that cannot be offended.</hi> I was therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually miſerable, becauſe neither the one nor the other was my State; for, on the one Hand, I was conſcious that I gave daily Offence to God and Man; and, on the other Hand, my Conſcience was daily offended thereby. I was merry, indeed, though not happy, when in Company, but ever dejected when left alone; ſo that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my three Years Incorporation with this Fraternity, I never once lifted my Heart in any Appeal to God, nor ventured to petition for any Kind of Favour from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0237300103:137"/>
Though theſe Reprobates, as I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, continued to perpetrate, and to glory, with a merry and ſatisfied Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in their daily Iniquities; yet, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they had not proceeded to Blood.</p>
               <p>On the Night, wherein I left them, we we were overtaken, and cut ſhort of our intended Reſt, by a ſudden and violent Tempeſt of Wind and Hail, whereupon we took Shelter in a waſte Barn that had belonged to the late Farmer of the Place.</p>
               <p>When we had ſtruck on our Tinder and lighted a Candle, we ſet together what Straw and Combuſtibles we could find in the Houſe, and had juſt kindled a Fire, when one of the Company came and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered that there was a Man aſleep in the far Corner. Hereupon, they took the Candle, and, with ſoftly and cautious Steps, found a Pedlar ſtretched along, with his Head on a Wiſp of Straw, and his Box cloſe beſide him. They immediately lifted the Box, and brought it away, in Silence, to the Place where I was ſitting. On opening it, with as little Noiſe as poſſible, they found therein a large Quantity of Silks, Linens, and Laces, with a rich Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of hard Wares; and, at the Bottom, a little padlocked Cheſt, full of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pieces of Gold; in all Likelihood
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0237300103:138"/>the whole Amount of the Labours of his Life.</p>
               <p>This was a Prize not to be thrown down the Stream. Immediately all was in a kind of underbreathing Buſtle, and whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commotion. The great Queſtion was, how to poſſeſs themſelves of ſuch a Prey, with Safety to their Perſons. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that the Man might waken; they were unluckily ſeen coming that way, and, it may be, entering into that Houſe; the Country might be alarmed and riſe upon them; they might be overtaken; they might be ſeized in the very Fact.</p>
               <p>At length, a bold Villain propoſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to cut his Throat, and that, then, there could be no witneſs to teſtify againſt them; but to this it was again objected, that the Blood itſelf would be the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt and ſureſt of all Witneſſes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, another propoſed to ſuffocate or ſtrangle him and bury his Corps on the Spot; to which Scheme, though many were ſilent, yet no one expreſsly excepted.</p>
               <p>During this deadly Conſultation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my long Courſe of evil Habit, and evil Example, my Blood curdled throughout my Body, and Fear, Horror, and Deteſtation aroſe in my Boſom. But, when they went, as I ſuppoſed, to put the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0237300103:139"/>deed of Death into inſtant Execution, I crouched and ſhrunk inward; and creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at the Door, the Dread of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, alſo, ſeized and murdered, gave me Strength to get on my Feet, and, feeling along by the Wall, I got away from the Houſe, and made off I neither knew nor cared where or whereto.</p>
               <p>The Tempeſt ſtill continued; the driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Clouds added to the natural Horrors of Night; I could ſcarcely diſcern that I had a Road under my Foot. But, though I could not ſee my Purſuers, I yet feared that their Eyes were better than mine; and I ſtill turned and liſtened, to try if the Foot of the Murderer was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me.</p>
               <p>Having travelled all Night as faſt and far as I could from the Scene of my Terrors; on the Riſing of the Day I ſaw a large Town before me, and, for the firſt time of three Years, I lifted up my Eyes, and inwardly bleſſed God for his Mercy in my Eſcape from ſo great a Wickedneſs. Thereupon I felt a Pleaſure that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt before; and I ſaid in my Heart, if you will once more be my God, I will be your true Servant, and will never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or tranſgreſs any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0237300103:140"/>
I then walked on leiſurely, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue went from me, and I ſeemed quite lightſome to myſelf. On entering the Suburbs I met a Gentleman taking his Morning's Walk out of Town. I ſtopped and looked him wiſtfully in the Face, whereupon he alſo ſtopped and eyed me with much Attention. Who are you, my pretty Lad? ſays he. An unhappy Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Sir, who wants a Service, or any Means of earning a little honeſt Bread. And pray what Service can you do? Not much, Sir, I fear, but my Good-will ſhall ſtrive hard to make up my Lack of Ability. Then, cried he, you ſhall be my Servant. All the Servants I ever had promiſed every thing, but did little; I will now try what may be done by one who promiſes nothing. What is your Name, my Boy? <hi>David Doubtful,</hi> Sir; for that was my true Name, though I had gone by ſeveral others. And what Wages muſt I give you, <hi>David?</hi> Juſt as much, Sir, or as little as you ſhall pleaſe to think I deſerve.</p>
               <p>Here he took me to a handſome Houſe, where he kept a Mercer's Shop in <hi>Plymouth.</hi> His Name was <hi>Felton;</hi> he had been a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower, of ſome Years; and had an only Son who was then at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> School in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0237300103:141"/>
My Maſter, at firſt, ſet me to the moſt ſervile and vile Offices, ſuch as cleaning his and the Servants Shoes; ſweeping the Street before his Door, and carrying out the Dirt of the Houſe; but all this I did with Willingneſs, and even with Pleaſure, as ſome little Matter of Penance for my long Courſe of evil Deeds.</p>
               <p>On my ſeparating from my Brethren in Iniquity, as I have told you, I was the Proprietor of one hundred and ſeventy odd Pounds, which was locked up in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Cheſt, being my allotted Dividend of the Fruits of our common Knavery, for three ſucceſſive Years; but, in my preſent Turn of Mind, I would no more have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted any Part thereof, than I would have taken a Bar of red hot Iron into my Hand. I had alſo, in my Pocket a few Crowns with ſome ſmaller Silver, but theſe I ſecretly diſtributed among the Poor, that no Part, as it were, of <hi>Achan</hi>'s accurſed Thing might remain about me.</p>
               <p>In about three Weeks, my Maſter again changed the whole Manner of my Service, and ſet me to bruſh his Clothes, dreſs his Wigs, whet the Knives, lay the Cloth, and attend at Table; but theſe were Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in which I was quite expert, as I had
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0237300103:142"/>not yet forgotten my Employment with my firſt Maſter.</p>
               <p>In ſome Time after, Mr. <hi>Felton</hi> aſked me if I could read; a little in the Bible, Sir, ſaid I. And, can you write too, <hi>David?</hi> If you pleaſe I will try, Sir. Why, <hi>David!</hi> this beats the Hand of my Clerk; where in the World did you come by all this Learning? From a very good Maſter to a very bad Servant; but, pray Sir, do not enquire the Particulars of my Naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs; for, indeed, you could not deſire a ſeverer Monitor than my own Conſcience is to me. Well, my Child, ſaid the good Man, I will not put you to Pain; and ſo, giving me a Squeeze by the Hand, he went out with a gliſtening Eye.</p>
               <p>From this Time my Maſter ſhewed an uncommon Reſpect and Attention to me. He diſcharged me from all the menial Offices of his Houſehold; he gave me his Burdens of Silks, and other Wares to carry to his ſeveral Cuſtomers; and he deſired me to take particular Notice of the Nature and Values of what I carried.</p>
               <p>On this Encouragement I became vaſtly more apprehenſive and aſſiduous than he looked for. I attended the Shop cloſely, and took Notice and private Notes of all that was eſtimated or tranſacted therein.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0237300103:143"/>My Maſter looked quite amazed, on aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſome Queſtions with reſpect to his Affairs. His eldeſt Prentice, ſoon after, ſet up for himſelf. He then placed me behind the Counter, over his younger Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, and in joint Authority with his Journeyman. And, ſoon after, he gave me the Key of his Till, and the Truſt of all his. Treaſure. I now dined with him at the ſame Table, and conſulted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with him as his Friend and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. He gave me frequent Pocketmoney, which, he told me, he would not charge to the Account of my Wages. I walked with him every Evening, went to Church with him every Sunday, and read to him, in the Bible, every Night. I was now wholly reconciled to my God, and felt him in my Soul as a Friend and Benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Pleaſure play'd about my Heart, Peace lay under my Pillow; and my Happineſs ſeemed as a Ship that, after a long and deſperate Voyage, had anchored in a calm and ſecure Haven.</p>
               <p>I had now been ſomething upward of a Year in the Service of Mr. <hi>Felton,</hi> when, one Day, I heard a buſtling Noiſe in the Street, and ſaw People running hither and thither acroſs the Window. I ſtepped to the Door, and, looking to the Left, ſaw a great Crowd about a Cart, wherein were five Criminals going to Execution. I ſtaid
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0237300103:144"/>till they came juſt oppoſite to me, when, to my utter Aſtoniſhment and Terror, I I ſaw five of my old Acquaintance, and, in the Front of them, the bloody Villain who had propoſed cutting the Throat of the unfortunate Pedlar. Inſtantly I turned all pale as my Shirt, and, dreading that they would know and claim Acquaintance with me, I ſhrunk in, and, running back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, threw myſelf half fainting into a Chair.</p>
               <p>I now reflected that it was happy for me that no one was in the Shop to take Note of my Confuſion; and endeavouring to aſſume ſome Courage, on the Enterance of our Journeyman, I put on the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned Appearance that I could.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Felton</hi> happened to dine abroad that Day, and did not return till the Cloth was laid for Supper. He took his Chair at Table, and deſired me to ſit beſide him. <hi>David,</hi> ſaid he, is it not wonderful that People ſhould continue ſo incredulous, notwithſtanding the frequent and daily Proofs of an all-ſeeing and an all-detecting Providence? If a Sparrow falls not to the Ground without the Notice of our God, how much more will he take Account of the Life of him whom he formed in his own Image. The Villain truſts to hide his Villany, and dares to affirm (with the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0237300103:145"/>firſt Murderer) in the Face of God and of Man, <hi>I know not where is my Brother.</hi> But Blood has a Voice, a crying Voice, <hi>David;</hi> it cries aloud to Heaven, from the very Bowels of the Earth. No Depth can cover it, no Darkneſs can conceal it, for the Light that ſhineth in Darkneſs will bring it forth to the Day.</p>
               <p>About twelve Months ago, a Pedlar, or itinerant Merchant, was murdered in a waſte Houſe, called <hi>Fielding</hi>'s Barn. The Murderers were of the People whom they call Gipſies, the moſt ſubtile and evaſive of all Sorts of Reprobates, ſo that the Fact lay a long Time in Silence. This Pedlar, as it ſeems, had an only Brother, to whom the Reverſion of his Subſtance belonged; and this Brother, not ſeeing or hearing from him of a long Time, went through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Country, and through many Parts of the Kingdom, enquiring after him. At length he arrived, over Night, at an Inn ſome Miles from hence, where he found, in the Kitchen, ſeven Men jovially ſeated over a Bowl of Punch; he quickly accepted their Invitation, and having ſpent the Time pleaſantly, and the Houſe being throng, he and one of the Company were ſhewn to the ſame Bed.</p>
               <p>About Midnight, his Companion began to moan moſt piteouſly, when, jogging,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0237300103:146"/>and aſking him why he groaned? O, <hi>Fielding</hi>'s Barn, he cried, <hi>Fielding</hi>'s Barn, <hi>Fielding</hi>'s Barn! Again, lying ſtill awhile, he ſtarted, and cried, you cannot ſay it, you cannot ſay that my Hand was in the Murder. Again he would mutter, with a half ſmother'd Voice, ſee, ſee, how he ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, ſee how he kicks; put, put him out of Pain, O, put him out of Pain!</p>
               <p>Hereupon, the Brother roſe and dreſſed as quietly as poſſible, and, making way to the next Magiſtrate, he returned and ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and carried off his Bedfellow before any of his Comrades were apprized of the Matter.</p>
               <p>What have you done, you Villain, ſaid the Magiſtrate without Preface, what have you done with the Body of the Pedlar whom you murdered in <hi>Fielding</hi>'s Barn? On this Queſtion, the Wretch, thinking that all was detected, inſtantly fell on his Knees. I had neither Hand nor Heart in the Murder, Sir, he cried; and, if you will get me a Pardon, I will faithfully tell you the whole Affair. On his Confeſſion, the five principal Rogues were arreſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were out of Bed. And, on his Evidence, and that of their ſeventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, they were ſentenced, and this Day executed, and are to be gibbeted in the Morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0237300103:147"/>
During this Narration, I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from expreſſing, by my Countenance and Geſture, the ſtrong Compunction I felt on recollecting my long Aſſociation with thoſe Reprobates; but my good Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I ſuppoſe, aſcribed my Emotions merely to the Deteſtation which I had of their Deeds.</p>
               <p>I had been cloſe upon two Years in the Service of Mr. <hi>Felton,</hi> and he had lately agreed with me at 25<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> yearly, whereof he paid me the laſt Year's Wages in Hand; when, one Evening, as I ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Counter, a young Woman came in and deſired to ſee ſuch and ſuch Goods. While ſhe was cheapening on the one Hand, and I ſetting forth the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Value on the other, ſeveral intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Glances were exchanged between us. Whenever her Eyes met mine, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly caſt them down with a bluſhing Modeſty; and, yet, whenever I looked at her, I ſaw that her Eyes had been fixed upon me. At length, having bought ſome little Matters, ſhe made me a baſhful Courteſy, and going out at the Door, ſhe turned upon me with a ſignificant Glance and departed.</p>
               <p>All that Night I felt myſelf as I had never felt before; I turned, and turned
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0237300103:148"/>again from the Image of this Girl, and yet ſhe ſeemed to ſtand before me, and to look, and to look upon me, as ſhe had done the Day before.</p>
               <p>For five tedious Days ſhe witheld her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from my Sight, and I feared that I ſhould never behold her any more. At length ſhe came, and I ſtrove in vain to conceal my Joy on her Appearance. After cheapening and paying for ſome little Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhe caſt her Eye on a Piece of Silk, which, ſhe ſaid, ſhe fancied greatly, but feared that her Pocket would not reach ſo far. O Miſs, ſaid I, we ſhall not quarrel for ſuch a Matter, provided I know where to call for the Money. On <hi>Sarah Simper,</hi> Sir, ſaid ſhe, at ſuch a Sign in ſuch a Row.</p>
               <p>As I had three or four ſpare Hours from Buſineſs every Evening, I gladly laid hold of the Occaſion I had gotten for ſpending that Time in Viſits to my Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I went, indeed, without forming any Purpoſe or Intention, ſave the Pleaſure of ſeeing her. Her Fondneſs ſeemed, at leaſt, to equal my own; and, tho' we proceeded, at Times, to Toying, and Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying, yet, for three Weeks we kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in warrantable Limits. But this was not always the Caſe. Our firſt Tranſgreſſion was ſucceeded, on her Part, by Tears and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0237300103:149"/>Reproaches, and, on mine, by a Depth of Sorrow and Remorſe.</p>
               <p>As this was my firſt Fault, with reſpect to Woman, my Conſcience was yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeled. I ſpent the Night in Sighs and Tears of Contrition; and I repeated a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Promiſes and Vows to my God that I never would be guilty of the like again.</p>
               <p>For five entire Days I kept from going to her. At length I conſidered, that, as I had injured her, I ought to make her ſuch Recompence, as was in my Power. I put about twelve Pounds into my Pocket, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that I had left of my laſt Year's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, and went and told her that I was come to take my leave of her; then, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Money into her I ap, I promiſed to give her what I ſhould earn from Time to Time, and to marry her whenever I ſhould be enabled to maintain a Family. Here we both fell into Tears, and, from Tears we proceeded to Careſſes, and ſo forth, till, at laſt, we became as guilty as we had been before.</p>
               <p>In like Manner, for the ſix enſuing Weeks, I kept on in a Courſe of repenting and ſinning, and of ſinning, and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting. Every Night, I formed Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I imagined would be ſtronger than any I had made before, but, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0237300103:150"/>Force I put on myſelf, whatever Strength I exerted, I never was able to perſevere for three Days together. When I felt myſelf drawn to her, as by ſome ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable Chordage, I vowed, and flattered myſelf, on the Way, that I would return without tranſgreſſing; but when I came to her, I found it quite as impoſſible to keep from ſinning with her as it was to keep from her. Thus, by frail, and falſified Vows, I daily continued to add to the Heap of my Guilt; till, at length, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hopeleſs of any Ability to reſiſt Temptation, and ſinned on with my Eyes open, and yet with leſs Remorſe than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>As I was ſitting with her one Evening, a Bailiff enter'd ſuddenly, and laid an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon her for fifteen Pounds, which, he ſaid, ſhe promiſed to pay for her Mother, in her laſt Illneſs. Whether the Debt was feigned, and the Caption preconcerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, I know not; but I, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, recollected that ſhe did not ſeem to be ſo alarmed, as one would have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch an Occaſion. On the other Hand, my Soul was filled with bitter and diſtracting Thoughts. I could not think of ſuffering my Love to be confined, among Fellows, in a common Priſon; and yet, how to come by the Money I knew not.</p>
               <p>offered the Man my Note payable when
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0237300103:151"/>my Salary ſhould be due; but he refuſed to depart without inſtant Payment. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I hurried Home, and taking out 15<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> of my Maſter's Money, I returned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the Action.</p>
               <p>From this Time, my fair one began to extend her Appetites, and to riſe in her Paſſions. Under Colour of being with Child, her Longings and Fits came fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon her; and I was in a Manner conſtrained to indulge her, till I had taken of my Maſter's Money to the amount of fiſty Pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> ſaid ſhe, one Day, it is Time to tell you, that I muſt ſoon quit my Mantuamaking Buſineſs, for I am grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too big to appear with Decency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my Cuſtomers. So you muſt take other Lodgings for me, and provide a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Fund to defray the many neceſſary Expences of Child-birth. And where, my deareſt <hi>Sally,</hi> may ſuch a Fund be provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? I have already gone Lengths for you that may bring me to the Gallows. If you had not been a poor ſpirited Fellow, ſays ſhe, you could not bear to live in the Fears that haunt you ſo; you would long ſince have made away with that old Scoundrel your Maſter. Here, throw this little Duſt into his Broth, or his Poſſet, and then you
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0237300103:152"/>may wallow in Money without Fear of Account.</p>
               <p>Here, I looked her full in the Face, when, every Beauty, that had once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted me, ſuddenly vaniſhed from my Sight, and I ſaw nothing, but the dire Head of a ſneaky Meduſa. However, I ſuppreſſed my Horror as well as I could; and, putting back the Paper, No, no, no no, <hi>Sally,</hi> ſaid I, I would rather die the worſt of Deaths, myſelf, than have a Hand in making away with my kind old Maſter. And die you ſhall then, ſhe cried, for I. will not periſh alone. She then dropped on her Knees and vowed, with fearful Imprecations, that ſhe would go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to Mr. <hi>Felton</hi> and make a Diſcovery of my Robberies; that ſhe would alſo go to the next Magiſtrate and ſwear a Rape againſt me; and that ſhe would poiſon herſelf and the Baſtard within her, that ſhe might not bring into the World any Part of ſuch a Villain.</p>
               <p>While ſhe ſpoke, her Aſpect looked livid and deadly, and Wrath and Deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flaſhed in Fire from her Eyes.</p>
               <p>My dear <hi>Sally,</hi> ſaid I, lower your Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a little, give me that Paper again; we ſhall ſee what may be done. And here I leave you my Watch, as a Pledge of my
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0237300103:153"/>Return by to morrow at Noon. This I did, however, not with the ſmalleſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of keeping my Promiſe; for I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined never more to look her in the Face. But I bequeathed to her, as it were, the only Stake of Value which remained to me, that the Wretch whom I had ruined might not be left, altogether, without Means of Life.</p>
               <p>When I got into the Street, I haſtened homeward, without deliberating a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on what I was about, or on the Conſequences that might enſue. My Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was in a back Chamber, looking over ſome Letters, when I ruſhed in precipitate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſhut the Door behind me. What is the Matter, Child, ſays he, are you not well? you look pale and affrighted, what is the Matter, <hi>David?</hi> O Sir, O Sir! and I ſunk upon my Knees, I bring to you a Villain, a Reprobate, a Thief, a Robber, a Betrayer of Truſts, alſo, the vileſt Sinner that ever ſinned againſt God and againſt Man. I got in League with a bad Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who ſeduced me, by her Beauty, and then prevailed upon me to defraud and rob you, and would have perſuaded me to murder you, but there I ſtopt ſhort; I could not be prevailed upon to murder you, my Maſter. Pray then, ſaid he, ſomewhat ſternly, to what Intent are you come? to demand Juſtice, Sir, I cried, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0237300103:154"/>to appeaſe my own Conſcience by ſuffering for my Faults. Tell me then, ſaid he, mildly, and tell me truly, of how much Money have you defrauded me? Of fifty Pounds, Sir, I anſwer'd, a few Shillings under or over. Riſe then, pray riſe, my <hi>David,</hi> he cried; I would not bring you to Shame, and much leſs to Puniſhment, for five times the Value of fifty Pounds. I owe you, for your Services, very nearly that Sum, and I forgive you the Remainder with all my Heart. No, Sir, I cried aloud, and burſt into Tears, you do not forgive me, you cannot forgive me, for this your Goodneſs does but heap the heavier Guilt upon my Soul.</p>
               <p>He then got up, and came to me, and raiſing me to his Boſom, he embraced me and cried, I rejoice over thee, my <hi>David,</hi> I rejoice over thee, my Child, as Heaven rejoiceth over the one Sinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, more than over the ninety and nine that have no need of Repentance. You now know your own Frailties, you are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your Lapſes, you will be cautious of future Falls, and you ſtand upon firmer Ground than ever.</p>
               <p>You know me not, I exclaimed, you know me not, my good Maſter. I am wholly irreclaimable. The Devil has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Poſſeſſion of me, and reigns through
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0237300103:155"/>all my Members. I find it quite in vain to ſtrive or ſtruggle againſt him. I have no more Strength than a Midge againſt Temptation; no more Power than a weak and fainting Man againſt a Torrent that, already, has borne him far away.</p>
               <p>I will pray for you, my Son, ſaid the good Man vehemently, I will wreſtle with my God for you, and his Grace ſhall be ſufficient. No, Sir, I replied, after that which has happened, I never ſhall be able to look you in the Face, I will not truſt myſelf. I know that I ſhould fall on the firſt Trial. Will you leave me then, he cried, will you leave me, my Son <hi>David?</hi> and he took out his Handkerchief and wiped away the falling Tear. I muſt, I anſwered, I muſt leave you, my deareſt Maſter, I ſhould be miſerable if I ſtaid. I will go directly to Sea, I will confine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſome Ship, where I ſhall be ſhut from any Commerce or Communication with Mankind, and not have it within my Reach to wrong or damage any Perſon. And, indeed, I could not bear to ſtay in one Town, or even in one Kingdom with that bad Woman. Where may ſhe be found, <hi>David?</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Felton.</hi> Ah, Sir! I exclaimed, leave her to God, and to her own evil Conſcience, I beſeech you. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhe is with Child by me. Do not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0237300103:156"/>deſire, my Maſter, to hurt a little Innocent that has not yet ſeen the Light! No, my <hi>David,</hi> no; I mean nothing but Comfort to her. I mean to ſupply her Wants and to ſoften her Diſtreſſes. She will not then be tempted to wiſh Hurt to her Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and I will take Care of the little Wretch which ſhe carries in her Body, for your ſake, my <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was ſomething ſo affecting, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, in ſuch a Proof of wonderful Goodneſs, as muſt have ſtruck to the Heart of the moſt abandoned Reprobate. I was quite overcome thereby. I fell ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly at his Feet, and I wiſhed to pour out my very Soul, in the ſame Manner as I poured my Tears upon them.</p>
               <p>As he now found that I was bent and determined on departing, <hi>David,</hi> ſays he, ſince you will go, you muſt not go unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. A Sailor ought to have with him his Cheſt, and Cheques, and Jackets, with his Books and Inſtruments of Navigation, and ſo forth; and, if you will give me your Company for three or four Days longer, I will look out to procure you ſome little Matter of Station, and get you a good Birth in ſome Ship or other. Mean time, I would adviſe you to ſet about your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, for which Purpoſe you muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe fifty Guineas, which you may
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0237300103:157"/>pleaſe to return me, when ſome happy Adventure ſhall furniſh you with Means. No, no, Sir, I cried, putting his Purſe back with my Hand, your Plan is not the Plan of your reprobate Servant; your good Stations and good Births are not at all for my Purpoſe. I will go as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sailor; the meaneſt Offices and the greateſt Drudgery will be a Penance, too little, much too little, for my Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And, ſo ſaying, I turned, and went haſtily out.</p>
               <p>I made directly to the Quay, where I ſaw a Crowd of Citizens intermixed with Sailors. On going up, I found that they were enliſting Volunteers, to whom they offered from one to three Guineas <hi>per</hi> Man. And what will you give me, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if I go with you? He then looked earneſtly at me, and, having eyed me, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, from Head to Foot, I will give you my Lad, ſaid he, five Guineas in your Fiſt, the beſt Meſs of Pottage, the ſnuggeſt Hammoc to lie in, and here is my Hand for a hearty Welcome into the Bargain. If your Honour then will be pleaſed to order thoſe five Pieces to be laid out for me, in Cheques and Trowſers, and ſuch Neceſſaries as you think fitting; I live at ſuch a Place, and ſhall be ready at a Call. Enough, ſaid the Captain, our Ship is a thirty Gun, called the <hi>Centurion,</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0237300103:158"/>and your Friend <hi>David Jenkins,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of her. We ſet out by Morning's Tide, between ten and eleven; and if you come without a Call you will be the more welcome. So ſaying, he gave me a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Shake by the Hand, and we parted.</p>
               <p>I then went directly home, and, calling Mr. <hi>Pelton</hi> aſide, I told him of my Succeſs and Engagement in the <hi>Centurion,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing only the Time of my early Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for I felt that I could not ſtand the parting with him, and I thought it beſt to make it as little painful to him and myſelf, as might be.</p>
               <p>During Supper, I endeavoured to chat, but I could not. And, as Mr. <hi>Felton,</hi> at Times, looked affectionately upon me, I turned my Head aſide, and a ſilent Tear ſtole down my Cheek.</p>
               <p>I ſpent the Night in Sighs and Tears, and, getting up before Day, I took my Shoes in my Hand, and, ſtepping ſoftly down Stairs, would have ſtolen out at the Street Door; but, in that Inſtant, the Door of a ſide Parlour was opened, and, before I could look about, my Maſter had me in his Arms. Will you leave me, then, <hi>David,</hi> will you indeed leave me? he cried. O, <hi>David, David,</hi> I love you next to my
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0237300103:159"/>only Child. Stay with me yet, my Son, O, ſtay with me, my <hi>David,</hi> and I will do every thing, I will do all things that may be done for you.</p>
               <p>Here I ſunk, and was juſt fainting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Preſſure of his Goodneſs. Do not kill me, my Maſter, do not kill me out-right, I cried. You muſt no longer be burdened by my Body of Sin and Death; as God has forſaken me, I muſt leave you, my Maſter! let him do with me as he will, and if I periſh, I periſh. So ſaying, I broke from him, and away I ruſhed; weeping and ſobbing all the Way, as tho' my Heart would cleave in ſunder.</p>
               <p>The Captain received me with great Cordiality, and, at times, called me his Nameſake, and was very familiar with me. The Sailors alſo, after his Example, began to affect me without any Appearance of Envy; for, though I had not been exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Profeſſion, yet I was ſtrong and hale and active, and ready to aſſiſt them at every Turn.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, pleaſe your Honours, it may appear very extraordinary, that, though I felt daily Compunction, and night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wept many Tears for having offended my God throughout the Courſe of my Life; yet, I neither prayed to him, nor beſought
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0237300103:160"/>Pardon from him, nor applied to him for any kind of Support or Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>I was now incorporated with a Fraternity whoſe Wickedneſs was of a Species quite different from that of my former Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Our Sailors were ſo far from cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or defrauding, that they ſcarce ſeemed to have any Regard for Property; and they were as brave a Set of Fellows as ever trod a Deck. But then, they were as hardened to any Senſe of Religion or Piety as the nether Mill-ſtone; and the ſacred and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous names of God, and his Chriſt, were of no other Import to them than as the Balls of a Billiard Table, to be toſſed, and ſtricken, and bandied about for Sport.</p>
               <p>At firſt, this was a Matter of great Offence and Horror to me. Can there be a God, I would ſay to myſelf, and can he ſuffer his tremendous Name to be inſulted and blaſpherned, as it is by theſe Wretches? But, alas! I was not as one of the three Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives at <hi>Babylon;</hi> I could not be caſt into the Furnace and come forth without a Singe. In time, this Profaneneſs became leſs irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to my Ears; and, by Degrees, I began to reliſh, and to catch the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.</p>
               <p>At times, however, ſome Thoughts of God and a Saviour would come into my
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0237300103:161"/>Mind, and the pious Impreſſions of my Infancy would return upon me; but I did my beſt to baniſh them, as they ſerved but to torment me.</p>
               <p>At times, again, I would ſilently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate, as it were, with God. It is true, I would ſay to him, I have been wicked, deſperately wicked, through a long Courſe of ſinning; but, did I not long ſtrive, and ſtruggle, and fight againſt Temptation? If you meant me for yourſelf, why did you not make me with leſs Proneneſs to Evil; or why did you not give me greater Strength to reſiſt?</p>
               <p>Again, ſhocking and blaſphemous Thoughts would enter into my gloomy Soul: As though the Goſpel were all a Fable, and Religion nothing but Prieſtcraft. That all Events were of Chance. That Men were good or evil, merely according to Conſtitution; and that, either there was no God, or he was too great, or too diſtant to concern himſelf with the inſignificant Affairs of Mortals. But theſe Infuſions of the Tempter were never of long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; and again I would return to <hi>believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>trembling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Ship had been deſtinated to protect the Trade in the <hi>Levant.</hi> Within the Space of five Months, we had reſcued, from their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0237300103:162"/>Captors, ſix Veſſels of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Built and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Property; and we had made prize from time to time of three ſtout Frigates, of thoſe <hi>African</hi> Pirates who war upon the World; when the Boy from the Maſt Head cried out a Sail! We immediatly made chaſe, and found, by Evening, that we had gained conſiderably upon her; but, as the Night came on thick and hazy, we ſlacken'd our Courſe, and, in a manner, lay by till Morning, but hung out no Lights.</p>
               <p>At Dawn of Day, we renewed the chaſe, though no Sail was then in ſight; but we had not continued our Courſe above four or five Leagues, when we clearly diſcerned the ſaid Veſſel, and perceived that ſhe had tacked about and was bearing down toward us.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, we ſlacked our Sails and waited for her. But, we had not waited long, till we perceived a ſecond Veſſel that ſeemed in chaſe of the Firſt; and, ſome time after, ſaw a Third that ſeemed in chaſe of the two former.</p>
               <p>On this, the Mate, an old and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Sailor looked ſomewhat blank, and deſired that the Captain would inſtantly call a Council of War. Gentlemen, ſays he, the many Captures we have lately made
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0237300103:163"/>could not fail of informing our Enemies that we are in theſe Seas; and I apprehend, with great Reaſon, that they have made choice of their beſt Means to overreach and overmatch us, and to fall with their united Forces upon us. And, indeed, ye may already perceive that the Ship which we had in chaſe, has ſlackened her Sails, and waits to be joined by her two Conſorts, whom ſhe ſeemed ſo lately to fear. I think, as the Jockeys ſay, that we have more than Foot for them; and all the Queſtion is, whether old <hi>England</hi> ſhall make uſe of her Feet to fly, while ſhe has any Hands left wherewith ſhe may fight. At this, they cried, with one Voice, no flying, no flying! let them come on, the circumciſed Dogs, as many as may be of them; we will neither take nor give Quarter, they or we muſt to the Bottom! To work then, my brave Lads, cries Captain <hi>Jenkins,</hi> for we are likely to have as warm a Bout on't as we could wiſh.</p>
               <p>To buſtle went all Hands. Every Sail was fitted, the Ropes and Pullies were made pliable; and, for the firſt Time, we inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced and bedded our Nettings. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then ordered all the ſmall Arms to be gathered, and cleaned, and loaded, and laid upon Deck; and chooſing, from the Company, a Dozen of the beſt Markſmen, he diſpoſed them round the Ship, under
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0237300103:164"/>the Shelter of the Gunnel, with Orders to bring down every Enemy, who mounted any Shrowd within the Reach of a Muſket Ball.</p>
               <p>Our Ship, at this time, was full manned with about two Hundred and ſeventy Spirits, all as ready and deſirous to go and meet Death, as a Beau to go to a Ball, or an Alderman to a Feſtival.</p>
               <p>The three Conſorts were now joined, as our Mate had foreſeen, and came down in full Sail and a ſweeping Courſe upon us; and then it was that my Sins came crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into my Mind, and I believe I was the only Perſon of the Ship's Company who trembled.</p>
               <p>They all came up with a deſperate Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, while one attacked us in Front, the others run, along ſide, almoſt cloſe to our Gunnel, and, expecting inſtantly to ſink us, poured the Thunder of their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, on either Side, upon our Timber: While we raked the Ship, aſtern, with our chaſe Guns, and ſhower'd upon them, on either Side, the burning Hail of our ſmall Arms. This put them into ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and they ſheered off a little Space; when, in our Turn, we ſaluted them with a Broadſide, on either Hand, which went over the Heads of their Men, but much
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0237300103:165"/>damaged their Rigging. To repair this, they ran up the Shrowds, as thick as Bees upon a Branch, but our Markſmen brought them down in a Shower upon their Decks, and, as we plentifully ſupplied them with new-loaded Arms, in a ſhort time there was not a Man to be ſeen among their Sails.</p>
               <p>Our Ship was of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Oak, and ſtood their Shot to a wonder; our Mettal was alſo much weightier than theirs; but then they outnumber'd us three to one, in Men and in Guns.</p>
               <p>Having got out of the Reach of our ſmall Shot, they moved off, as intending to make their Eſcape; but, having repaired their Tackle, as well as time would allow, they returned upon us with twofold Reſolution and Fury.</p>
               <p>Then it was, Gentlemen, that ſuch a Scene was opened, as was ſufficient to ſtrike Hell itſelf with Horror.</p>
               <p>They now entertained us with a new Kind of Warfare. For, getting up within Piſtol ſhot, they toſſed their Grenadoes or Hand Shells among us, that were filled with broken Bottles, and with ruſty and ragged Pieces of old Iron. Theſe did fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Execution, and our Deck was quickly covered with Blood, and Brains, and Pieces
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0237300103:166"/>of human Fleſh, while the Noiſe of the Cannon could ſcarcely drown the Screams of the wounded and the Groans of the dying.</p>
               <p>All enraged and deſperate, we now tore away the Beds and Netting, that confined their Shells to our Deck, and, heaving them over-board, we lower'd the Level of our Cannon, and poured our Grape-ſhot into the Midſt of their Ships on either Side, which made horrible Havock and Uproar among them; whereupon, two of them ſheered away as faſt as their tatter'd Cordage would permit, while the third kept playing upon us at a Diſtance.</p>
               <p>We now had Leiſure to clear our Deck, and, with ſorrowful Hearts threw our dead and our dying Companions overboard, as alſo all whom we judged to be paſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. Among, our wounded was one <hi>Daniel Mc. Daniel,</hi> who had loſt his right Hand by the burſting of a Shell; and, while we meant to ſpare him, heave me over, heave me over, my Lads, he gallantly cried, ſince I no longer can help you, let me not be your Hindrance! No, <hi>Daniel,</hi> no, I cried, you ſhall not be heaved off. Such a Heart, with a left Hand, may be better to us, one Day, than the two Hands of a <hi>Goliah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0237300103:167"/>
Having, once more, ſet all to Rights, we moved toward the Veſſel that continued to annoy us, whereupon ſhe veered away and joined her Conſorts. We then bore down on all three, but they gave way before us and maintained a running Fight; and as they levelled their Shot almoſt wholly at our Rigging, by Evening we were inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of further Purſuit, for we had ſcarce a Yard of entire Shrowding left, and our Sails fluttered in the Wind and fell along by their Maſts.</p>
               <p>Mean while, we had plied them with our Cannon as faſt as we could load; and, as it began to wax duſkiſh, we perceived the Crew of the hindmoſt in much Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and they repeated the Signals of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs to their Conſorts. Soon after, we ſaw them heave out their Boat, and they had ſcarce crowded in and moved off a Piece, when their Ship ſunk outright and went plum to the Bottom. Hereon, we gave a great Shout, which we repeated on ſeeing their Boat overſet. But, as the <hi>Moors</hi> are excellent Swimmers, I ſuppoſe moſt of them got ſafe, and were taken in by their Companions. In the mean Space, our brave <hi>Daniel Mc Daniel</hi> was put out of Pain by a Grape-ſhot in the Temple; and our moſt gallant Captain <hi>Jenkins</hi> had his right Leg carried off half way up his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0237300103:168"/>Thigh, by a Cannon Bullet; I think it was the laſt Shot the Enemy fired.</p>
               <p>As I ſtood by my Captain's Side, I catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in my Arms before he fell to the Board, and cried out for the Surgeons; but the Effuſion of Blood was ſo great, and ſo impoſſible to be ſtanched, that we quickly deſpaired of any Life for him.</p>
               <p>As I ſupported him on Deck with my right Arm, he found himſelf growing faint, and turned his Face to me. <hi>David,</hi> ſaid he, I am not afraid to die, for I am a Chriſtian. I believe, as ſurely as I am here, that Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners, of whom I am chief; and he is ſo great and ſo gracious, that he will not ſuffer Hell or the Grave to diſappoint him of an End for which he paid ſo dear a Price. Here, my <hi>David,</hi> here is my Purſe and my Watch, which I bequeath to your Love as my laſt Legacy; and here is my Diamond Ring with which I entruſt you, as a Token to my dear Daughter, if ever it ſhall be your Fortune to reviſit old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And, if you ſhould go to <hi>London,</hi> my dear <hi>David,</hi> enquire out my good old Friend, Alderman <hi>Bicker;</hi> tell him of my Behaviour during your Service with me, and that I beſeech him to uſe his Intereſt with our Protector in procuring my Pay for my poor ſweet Child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0237300103:169"/>
And that I will, right heartily, cried out Sir <hi>Thomas.</hi> I will alſo ſpeak a Word for yourſelf, my Lad; the Protector cannot refuſe his Favour to one who has had the Honour of ſerving in the Action of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> whoſe Fame our very Enemies have ſpread through <hi>Europe.</hi> But, pray, proceed in your Narration; I long to hear of the Event, and of your future Succeſſes.</p>
               <p>Though we greatly grieved for our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, we were ſtill more concerned for the Honour of <hi>England,</hi> leſt our good Ship ſhould fall into the Hands of the Barbarians. For ſhe now lay like a Hulk on the Face of the Water. She could neither purſue nor avoid an Enemy; and, though ſhe had been in Plight, we had not Hands left ſufficient to work her.</p>
               <p>Night came on apace, Hoſtilities ceaſed on both Sides; the Pirates hung out Lights to prevent, as we ſuppoſed, their parting from each other; and we mournfully called a Muſter of our Men, in the dark; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we found that, of two hundred and ſeventy odd Men, we had but fifty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, twenty of whom were wounded, though not diſabled.</p>
               <p>Come, my Lads, cried the old Mate, it is as good to be merry as ſad. We have
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0237300103:170"/>wrought enough to Day to give us an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. Let us have a Piece of Pork and a Bowl of Punch; and, if we die by Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let us not die with cold Hearts and empty Stomachs. Moreover, for your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, I take upon me to promiſe that, if you will be guided, I will make you the Maſters of one of yonder Veſſels before Sunriſe.</p>
               <p>We engaged Compliance to a tittle; and, after Supper and a plentiful Draught, he ordered our Boats to be heaved over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board and let drive with the Wind. We then ſet our Watch, and went down to take a few Hours Repoſe.</p>
               <p>Two Hours before Day we were rouſed by our Mate, and, the firſt thing we did was to bore a large Hole in the Side of our Ship, about a Foot below Water, for which we had an occaſional Plug prepared.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Day dawned, we ſet Watches at the Cabin Windows, to give us timely Notice of the Enemy's Approach; and we lay down on our ſmall Arms, withinſide the Gunnel, quite out of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>The Pirates, as we preſumed, held up their Glaſſes, but, ſeeing neither Men nor Boats in our Ship, they concluded that we
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0237300103:171"/>had made an Elopement by Night, and came on without Precaution or Preparation.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they had arrived within about Half a League, our Watchmen, according to Order, drew forth the Plug, and, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Stairs, crouched down, and joined us.</p>
               <p>The Conſorts had agreed to board our Ship on each Side, in Confidence of a rich and unreſiſting Prize. But, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we heard the firſt of them ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling along-ſide, and perceived that they were beginning to aſcend our Gunnel, we jumped up, as one Man, and ſetting up a great Shout, and, overturning all we met, leaped into their Veſſel.</p>
               <p>Never was Amazement like that of the Enemy, they ſcarce made any Reſiſtance, and, in leſs than a Minute, not a Moor was left upon Deck.</p>
               <p>Mean time, the other Pirate had boarded our late Veſſel, and nearly all the Crew had now got upon Deck. They had heared, indeed, the Shout, with the Clamour and Groans of their Fellows, but did not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what to make of it; till, moving cloſe round the Head of our former Ship, we ſhot the few who were left in the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0237300103:172"/>ſecond Frigate; then, throwing out our Grapplings, we towed her a Piece off, and then bored and ſunk her in the Face of her Owners.</p>
               <p>They, thereupon, ſet up ſuch a Yell of Deſpair and Horror as was affecting, even to the Hearts of their Enemies. At length they turned the Cannon of the Centurion upon us; but, every Moment, we got further and further from their Shot; till, having reached to a Diſtance of about three Leagues, we ſaw our good Centurion go to the Bottom, the glorious Tomb of her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Captain who had fought her to the laſt.</p>
               <p>We now thought that, of about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Aſſailants, there was not one left to carry Tidings to their native Country of their Defeat. But, going down to the State-Cabin, I ſaw a young Man richly dreſſed, and of a noble Aſpect, leaning wounded upon a Couch, with three Attendants about him.</p>
               <p>As I enter'd, he gave me a Look that ſeem'd compounded of Apprehenſion and Courage, and accoſted me in mixed <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> for he had travelled much, and reſided for a Seaſon in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know, ſaid he, that I am your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; I alſo know what I am to expect.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0237300103:173"/>Draw your Cutlaſs then, and let me join my Countrymen! No, Sir, I replied, you have nothing to fear from me. A Man, who deſerves that Name, owes nothing but Love to Man, except when he is aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Brave ſee no Enemy in the Feeble or the Conquered.</p>
               <p>Where have you learned, he cried, the Sentiments of my own Soul? but, your Generoſity ſhall loſe you nothing; demand what Ranſom you pleaſe and it ſhall be paid you. I am not Commander in chief, I anſwered, but, as far as my Influence reaches, you are free as Air, and ſhall be bound to us by nothing but your Affections. Then, ſtretching forth his Arm, your Hand, my Brother! he cried, and giving me a kind Squeeze, the Tear came into his Eye.</p>
               <p>I went directly on Deck and informed our little Crew, now reduced to thirty three, of what had paſſed between the noble Moor and myſelf, and told them, I hoped they would be ſo generous as to make my Promiſe good. To this the greater Number gladly aſſented, but ſome of them murmured. Hereupon, I remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that we were already rich enough, for we had taken all the Plate and Money, with what was moſt valuable and portable, out of our own Ship, beſide the Treaſure in the pirate Frigate which we had not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0237300103:174"/>yet divided. I further repreſented, that we knew not what the Events of War or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune might be; and that it would not be imprudent to make a Friend on the <hi>African</hi> Coaſt, who, in all Appearance, was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of high Conſideration; and, with theſe Reaſons, at length, all appeared to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
               <p>I then carried the pleaſing Tidings to my new Friend, and took with me our only ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Surgeon, who dreſſed the Wound in his Thigh, which had been made by a Muſket Ball.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Surgeon had withdrawn, the noble <hi>Oſmyn</hi> of <hi>Petra,</hi> for ſo he was called, preſented me with his Purſe, and a Carbuncle Ring of extraordinary Value, and preſſed them earneſtly upon me; but I as peremptorily refuſed them, and this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal appeared to diſtreſs him greatly.</p>
               <p>During the five Days in which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued together, I had him as tenderly and as honourably attended as our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would admit; and I ſpent with him all the Time I could ſpare from my Duties and great Fatigues upon Deck, as all the Hands we had were kept buſily employed in ſplicing the Ropes, refitting the mangled Sails and Rigging, and in repairing the Breaches of the Veſſel; for our Cannon had
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0237300103:175"/>bored her Sides quite through in ſeveral Places.</p>
               <p>On theſe Accounts we ſailed but heavily, ſtill making toward the Straits, and daily wiſhing to meet or be overtaken by ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship of Force, to which we might ſafely confide ourſelves and our Treaſures.</p>
               <p>On the ſixth Morning, having arrived within twenty Leagues of the Mouth, the Day diſcovered to us that we were almoſt within Shot of a Ship of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Built, and that carried <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours. Hereat we rejoiced with exceeding great Joy, and ſlackening our Sail, and heaving out a ſmall Boat, ten of us ſlipt into it, and away we rowed with all our might. As we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, we ſaw Numbers, in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dreſſes, walking to and again on Deck; and, getting alongſide, they threw Ropes over to us, and we mounted with great Alacrity.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we were ſo intoxicated with Joy, that we had not the Precaution to hail them, till we found ourſelves in the very thick of our Enemies. I looked round, and, ſeeing none but tawny and hoſtile Faces about me, I civilly demanded who, and of what Country they were; when a Ruffian, gathering his Spittle, ſpirted it full in my Face, and, at the ſame time,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0237300103:176"/>gave me a Buffet on the Side of my Cheek. Then, I did not once reflect either where or among whom I was, but, with one Stroke of my Fiſt, I ſtretched him ſtiff along the Deck: Then, throwing up the Heels of another, who had raiſed his Arm againſt me, he fell with his Head foremoſt acroſs his Fellow; and twiſting round on a third, who had ſeized me behind by the Shoulder, I dragged him under me, and we fell together upon the Board. Here a Crowd of them gather'd over me, and, each helping to hold a Leg or an Arm, I was bound with Cords that cruſhed my Fleſh to the very Bone, and then tumbled with Kicks, like a Dog, along the Deck.</p>
               <p>Mean time, my nine Companions, who had offered to interpoſe, were alſo ſeized and bound, and caſt into the Hold.</p>
               <p>For about three Hours I lay in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Anguiſh, though, through a Sort of ſtubborn Pride, I endeavoured to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my Groans. In the Interim I felt the Ship begin to move, and, ſoon after, I perceived all in Buſtle about me, for I could ſee nothing that happened without<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Gunnel. Again I heared, from within and without, ſeveral Diſcharges of ſmall Arms, and, as I ſaw ſeveral <hi>Moors</hi> fall lifeleſs or convulſed and biting the Deck around me, I rightly concluded that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0237300103:177"/>the Ships were engaged. I gave a long and deep Groan, and I cried aloud, O, my Countrymen, my brave Countrymen! why am I not with you, why have I not the Happineſs of dying with you and for you? and my Heart was ſo wrung that I fainted quite away.</p>
               <p>I afterward learned that my true and valiant Fellows had refuſed to ſubmit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Summons. That the Pirate, ſeeing them ſo few, and being deſirous of ſaving the Frigate for their own Uſe, had attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with ſmall Arms, which were warmly anſwered, on our Part; when, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dropped or diſabled above Half of our brave <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with two of <hi>Oſmyn</hi>'s At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants who happened to be upon Deck, they enter'd and mercileſsly butcher'd the Remainder, among whom was our old Mate and Surgeon.</p>
               <p>Mean ſpace, I lay inſenſible to all that paſſed, till a Ruffian, ſeeing me pale and lifeleſs, in all Appearance, gave me a Wring by the Noſe. Hereupon I awaked to the bittereſt Senſations. I remember'd me of my gallant Meſſmates, who had ſo loved and careſſed me above my Merits; and my Tears, without Sigh or Groan, went in a River down my Cheeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0237300103:178"/>
At length, I heared a Voice, a known Voice as I thought, crying, where is my Friend, where is my Brother <hi>David?</hi> and, turning my Head a little, I ſaw my noble <hi>Oſmyn</hi> juſt entering the Ship.</p>
               <p>O, Gentlemen! be not apt to judge hardly of all who have not learned <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the Form and by the Letter. <hi>Oſmyn,</hi> my <hi>Oſmyn</hi> proves that he may be in the Heart of thoſe who never acknowledged his Name, altho' they have felt his Power. And, indeed, as the Apoſtle writes, thoſe, who never learned his Law, yet, having his Law, or rather Himſelf, in their Hearts, ſhall be juſtified.</p>
               <p>Having inſtantly caſt an Eye of ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love around, he ſpied where I lay, and coming, and throwing himſelf beſide me, he put one Arm about me, and cried, O, my Brother, my Brother <hi>David,</hi> is it thus that my People uſe you? I grieve that you, Chriſtians, ſhould beat us, all to nothing, in Honour and Humanity. He then took out his Knife, and having tenderly cut my Cords, he ſtrained his own Ability, to help me to riſe.</p>
               <p>He then called for the Captain who came, bowing to him with great Reſpect. Their Diſcourſe was long and earneſt. At
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0237300103:179"/>length <hi>Oſmyn</hi> roſe high in Paſſion, and gave the Captain a back Stroke with his Hand acroſs the Face. I obſerved his Choler ſwelling, almoſt to Suffocation, but he ſuppreſs'd his Indignation, and retired in Silence. I heard <hi>Oſmyn</hi> then giving ſome Orders to the Men, but, as I was a Stranger to their Language, I knew not the Purport of any thing that paſſed. Soon after, however, I ſaw my nine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions brought from the Hold, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. And <hi>Oſmyn,</hi> turning to me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to tell my People that they were all free, and that, as ſoon as we landed in <hi>Barbary,</hi> he would take the firſt Means of ſending them with Honour to their native Country. Ah, my Lord, I cried, I am ſorry that you ſtruck the Captain, he has many Adherents here, and will certainly ſeek ſome Method of Revenge. He dare not, he dare not, replied my Friend; the Villain would have diſputed with me the Property of my own Frigate, which I manned, and fitted out, at my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. But, if I hear or ſee any more of his Inſolence, as ſoon as we land I will complain to the <hi>Dey</hi> my Uncle, and have the Rogue impaled alive.</p>
               <p>He then ordered out the long Boat, and turning to me, ſaid, I am going, <hi>David,</hi> to take an Account of what Effects are left in my Ship; and, I would take you with
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0237300103:180"/>me, if you were in a Condition to go; but I will ſoon return, and, in the mean Time, order the Surgeon to do his beſt for allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Swelling in your Limbs.</p>
               <p>During his Abſence, the Ship's Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and even the Captain, whoſe Name was <hi>Barbar,</hi> behaved themſelves toward me and my Fellows with great, though ſilent, Civility; and a plentiful Meſs was ſerved up to us for Dinner. But, during our Repaſt, I obſerved that the Captain called ſuch and ſuch of his Men to the Quarter-deck, where he held with them a long and whiſpering kind of Converſation.</p>
               <p>Theſe Fellows, as it ſeems, were the moſt barbarous and bloody of all their barbarous and bloody Countrymen. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken the Ship wherein we then were, a Merchantman, carrying about twenty Guns, they had maſſacred every Creature on board, and then dreſſed themſelves in the Clothes of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in order to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigle others into the like Calamity; while they diſpatched their own Frigate back to <hi>Tunis</hi> to get Recruits.</p>
               <p>My noble Friend did not return till late in the Evening. He then order'd Supper to be got ready, and the State-Cabin to be prepared for him and I to lie in; but I whiſpered and beſought him to excuſe me
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0237300103:181"/>for declining that Honour, as I perceived that the Favours which he did me, had, already, given much Umbrage and Offence to his Countrymen.</p>
               <p>I know not whence, or for what Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Forebodings may come; but, all that Night, my Spirits were exceedingly ſad and depreſſed; and, though my Fellows and I were put to lie in a Part of the Ship, the moſt remote from my Friend; yet, I imagined that I heard ſecret Treadings and Mutterings; and again, at dead of Night, that I heard the diſtant Sound of trampling and ſtruggling, as of People in doing and receiving Violence.</p>
               <p>I was ſtill ſore, from the Tyings and the Bruiſes which I had received; when, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the End of a ſleepleſs Night, a Gang of armed Ruffians enter'd the Place where we lay, and loaded us with Irons. They then took away all our Clothes and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and threw to each of us, a Canvas Shirt and Drawers, as Slaves prepared for the Market.</p>
               <p>The Moment they laid their Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, it occured that they would not have dared to do it, if they had not firſt made away with my dear Friend and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron; at which Thought, my Soul grew
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0237300103:182"/>inſtantly ſick, and a dark Cloud of Sorrow fell heavily upon it.</p>
               <p>Sore and ſhackled as I was, I got im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on Deck, and looked wiſtfully out to Sea, but could diſcover no Frigate. I then ſhuffled along, as faſt as I could, to the Cabin where I had parted the Night before with my <hi>Oſmyn,</hi> and, looking in at the Door, I cried aloud, where are you Lord <hi>Oſmyn,</hi> where are you, my Maſter, my Friend, my dear <hi>Oſmyn,</hi> where are you, where are you?</p>
               <p>When no Anſwer could be had, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, wild with Rage and Grief, and notwithſtanding my Chains, had I not been diſabled by my Contuſions, I ſhould have done my beſt to throttle every Man I met. But all I could do was, to wring my Hands, and roar aloud to all around, yet Butchers, ye Cut-throats, ye Villains of all Villains! what have ye done with your Lord, what have ye done with your Maſter, what have ye done with my Friend, with my <hi>Oſmyn,</hi> my <hi>Oſmyn?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For two Nights and two Days, I taſted nothing but Water, which I drank in large Quantities, as my Soul, as well as Body, was in a Ferment and a Fever. On the third Day, the Captain, fearing that I would die of Grief, and that he ſhould loſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0237300103:183"/>what he propoſed to get by my Sale, ſent a kind of Interpreter to me, to let me know, that, on the Night in which I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Oſymn,</hi> he and the Captain, ſoon after, had ſome warm Words concerning their Rights in the Frigate, and in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> now on board; whereupon <hi>Oſmyn</hi> ſwore that he would not remain any longer in his Ship; and that, taking with him a Number of Hands, he reimbarked in the Frigate, and directly ſet Sail.</p>
               <p>As this Tale carried with it ſome Face of a Fact, I grew eaſier in my Mind; and, on the very Day following, having anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Bay of <hi>Algiers,</hi> my Fellows and I were taken into the Town, and ſold at public Market.</p>
               <p>I happened to be bought by one of the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Factors, who immediately ſent me to the Work at his Country Palace.</p>
               <p>This Work was a moſt ſtupendous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. Above five hundred Men had been daily employed in it for two Years paſt, and yet a third of it was not done when I arrived.</p>
               <p>A large Lawn extended itſelf in the Front of the Palace, and here the <hi>Dey</hi> had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a great Canal to be dug, and, from its Excavation a Mount to be raiſed, whoſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0237300103:184"/>Baſe meaſured three hundred Yards in Circumference. The Aſcent was eaſy and ſpiral, much reſembling the Prints you have ſeen of the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> The Border of this Aſcent was adorned, all the way, with lofty Cedars interlaced with all Sorts of aromatic and flowering Shrubs; and, from the top, before I left it, was to be ſeen the Bay, the Shipping, the City, and Country all around, while diſtant Mountains, on the one Hand, and an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Ocean, on the other, alone bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Proſpect.</p>
               <p>You will think it very extraordinary, Gentlemen, when I aſſure you, that, till I was in a State of Slavery, my Mind never was free. Hitherto I had been the Slave of Sin, and of Appetite, of Paſſions, and of Fears. But, here I counted to ſet up my Reſt for Life. I had no Parents, no wealthy Kindred, no Friend upon Earth, to whom I might look for a Pennyworth of Ranſom. There was, therefore, no further Proſpect for me, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further left to excite my Deſire, or to excite my Concern; and I ſunk gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as it were, down into the Peace of my own nothingneſs.</p>
               <p>I had been lately the Poſſeſſor of the Value of ſome Thouſands, and, now, I had not wherewithal to purchaſe a Morſel of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0237300103:185"/>Bread. But, I looked back on the many Scenes of my very many Wickedneſſes, and I did not look up, but looked down to my God, and cried, Not enough, it is not yet enough, O Lord! ſomething ſharper, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heavier! ſome Puniſhment that may expiate, and reconcile me to my God!</p>
               <p>One Night, as I lay on my Bed of Stubble, I looked up to God, through the Cloud of my own Iniquities, and ſaid, In Life, O my Lord, lay what thou pleaſeſt upon me, but, in the Hour of Death, ſave, ſave me from the Judgment! whereupon, ſomething within me, ſaid, Fear not, thou vile Wretch, fear not thou Worm <hi>David,</hi> for nothing ſhall be able to pluck thee out of my Hands. This gave me great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and Conſolation was followed by Peace, and Peace was followed by Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; inſomuch, that I poſſeſſed more of the Sweetneſs of Heart-felt Enjoyment, than came to the Share of twenty Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</p>
               <p>The Dey or Regent, then being, was called <hi>Ali Eben Buchar.</hi> He was a great Warrior, and yet a Man of an amiable Character, which is rarely the Caſe with Mooriſh Governors. He had been at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> when I was enſlaved; and, on his Return, he was ſo ſolicitouſly engaged
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0237300103:186"/>in Matters of State, that he was not at leiſure to come and ſee our Works. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the End of the ſecond Year of my Servitude, he arrived with a pompous Train, and in a Chariot drawn by Tygers. He was a portly and comely Perſonage, though his Complexion was a deep olive. He expreſſed high Delight, on ſurveying what we had done; and he ordered a Feſtival, of three Days, to be proclaimed for his Labourers, with Sports, and martial Exerciſes, and Prizes for the Victors.</p>
               <p>Great Preparations were made for this Entertainment. In a Plain, on the left of the Palace, a Square of half a Mile Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter was encloſed with Pales; within which none were permitted to enter, ſave the Dey and his Train, with thoſe who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in his ſeveral Works, amounting to about a thouſand Men. On one Side, within the Pales, a Throne was erected with two Seats, and lower Benches were placed on either Hand.</p>
               <p>Early on the Morning of the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Day, the Feſtival was opened by the Sound of Trumpets and Horns, and other martial Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>It had been a Cuſtom, among us of the Labourers who were young and active, when the Day's Work was over, to divert
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0237300103:187"/>our Fellows with various Exerciſes and Feats, ſuch as Wreſtling, Running, Leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and toſſing or trundling Leaden Balls, and ſo forth; I was, therefore, up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſooneſt, in hopes of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf on the Occaſion.</p>
               <p>By the Dawning, the City was emptied of its Inhabitants, and Crowds came on, after Crowds, from all Parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſo that the Pales were ſoon circled by an innumerable Concourſe.</p>
               <p>Then came <hi>Ali,</hi> with his Attendants, and, entering the Pale, aſcended his Throne. His favourite Sultana was placed on his left, and his Concubines took their Places on either Side, and his Courtiers and Guards arranged themſelves behind.</p>
               <p>Then were exalted, on Poles, the Prizes that were to be given to ſuch of the Slaves or Labourers as excelled in toſſing the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin, or in hitting a diſtant Mark with the Bow or with the Sling. But, as I had not been practiſed in theſe Matters, I content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf, for this Day, with being a Spectator. Some of the Candidates, on this Occaſion, were extremely expert, and would ſend an Arrow or ſling a Stone more directly to the Mark, than any <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> could ſhoot a Muſket Bullet; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the generous <hi>Ali</hi> added Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0237300103:188"/>to the Prizes which they had won, and immediately preferred them among his Troops.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Ali,</hi> to entertain his People, ordered a Dozen of his Courtiers to run at the Ring. Immediately a Number of neighing Steeds, richly capariſon'd, were led by Lackeys into the Liſts. The young Nobles, without Stirrup or Saddle, vaulted lightly into their Seats, and turning, and winding their fiery Horſes, with wonderful Command and Addreſs, gave high Delight to the Spectators. Each of them then caught a Javelin which was toſſed to him by an Attendant; and, ſetting out, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, almoſt at their Speed, three of them, in mid Courſe, bore off a ſmall Ring of Braſs, from the Thread by which it hung, on the Point of his Lance.</p>
               <p>After this, again, a great Number of burleſque Comedians enter'd the Pales, in order to act one of their <hi>African</hi> Drolls or Pantomimes; ſome of them repreſented Men, ſome Tygers, Hogs, and Bears; others Ghoſts, and others Goblins. But I could make nothing of ſuch a Jumblement of Intention, although it gave great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the Populace. And thus ended the Sports of the preſent Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0237300103:189"/>
While the People retired homeward, ſeveral Waggons were drawn in, heavy laden with Victuals and Liquors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the Slaves and Labourers were plentifully regaled.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Day was uſher'd in with the like Pomp, as the former; and Prizes were ſet up for lifting the Weight, for toſſing the Colt, and for pitching the Bar.</p>
               <p>At a little Diſtance from the Front of the Throne, a Ring was faſtened to a leaden Maſs, that weighed about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds, and above fifty Adventurers ſucceſſively attempted to lift, but, not a Man of them could move it. I then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, bowing lowly toward the Throne, and putting my right Hand in the Ring, and exerting my Powers, I raiſed it fairly from the Ground, whereupon a great Shout was ſuddenly given by all my Companions who wrought with me at the Mount. Hereupon a Black came up, of Herculean Bulk and Brawn, and, deſiring that fifty Pounds more ſhould be added to the Lead, he lifted and ſwung them in the Air with apparent Eaſe, and the Prize was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly adjudged to him.</p>
               <p>A large Iron Coit was then given to the Competitors, and, about a Dozen of them
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0237300103:190"/>toſſed it to a Diſtance that was thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. I then took it up, and threw it three Foot beyond the furtheſt. But again, the black Slave came up, who was not of our Company, and toſſed it two Foot beyond my Caſt, and conſequently atchieved the ſecond Prize.</p>
               <p>A long and maſſive Bar was then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, but all refuſed to take it in Hand, till the ſame Black ſeized it, and, putting one End to his Foot, pitched it off to a Diſtance that raiſed a Cry of Admiration. I then took my Turn, and giving my whole Strength and Action to this ſingle Caſt, I pitched it ſome Inches beyond the Throw of my Rival, whereupon another Shout was given and repeated. The Black, then, was wholly enflamed by Envy and Reſentment, and reclaiming the Bar, and exerting all his Force, he threw it to a Length, that, on Admeaſurement, was judged to exceed my Caſt, and he proudly laid hold on the third Prize.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Ali</hi> then ordered me to be brought before him. I went, and, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my Knee, laid my Head to the Earth. Riſe, ſaid he; I obeyed, and he ſurveyed me with long and earneſt Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Young Man, he cried, you have been this Day ſomething unfortunate, but you have not the leſs Merit; put this Ring
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0237300103:191"/>on your Finger, it diſcharges you, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, from all Kind of Labour; but it does not enfranchiſe you, becauſe, for the preſent, I do not chooſe to part with you. I reſpectfully took the Ring, and, again bowing to the Ground, retired in Silence.</p>
               <p>A Tournament of the young Nobles then enſued, wherein great Feats of Action and Proweſs was ſhewn. And the Day ended with another Droll to which I gave no heed.</p>
               <p>The Morning of the third Day was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened as uſual, and Prizes were exhibited for Wreſtling, for Running, and for Leaping.</p>
               <p>Immediately the black Champion ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped formidably forth, and challenged any to approach, who deſired to be cruſhed to Death, but not a Man accepted this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Invitation. Unwilling, then, that this Boaſter ſhould carry off the Prize, without a Conteſt, I ſtepped from my Rank, depending more upon Action than Force to cope with him. We both ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to our Canvas Drawers, and his Looks and Geſtures menaced me with inſtant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. I advanced, however, to eſſay him, and he ſtretched his Arms toward me, as a Vulture would reach his Pounces to ſeize upon a Chicken; when, ſpringing inſtantly up to him, I put a Hand upon
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0237300103:192"/>each of his Shoulders, and, vaulting lightly over his Head, I turned nimbly upon him, threw up his Heels, and laid him ſidelong on the Earth.</p>
               <p>As the Contraſt of our Colours had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd us remarkable to all the Spectators, a Shout was ſet up that rent the very Elements. But the Black roſe, and roared aloud, with his Lion-like Voice, for Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and the Judges, on weighing the Matter, appointed me to another Trial, forbidding further Fraud.</p>
               <p>Again we prepared to engage, and again my black Adverſary ſtretched forth his Arms, with Eyes flaſhing Fire, and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures diſtorted with Rage; when, retiring from him, as if diſmayed, I ſhot forward like Lightening, and, ſpringing from the Ground, I pitched the whole Weight of my Body into his Boſom. This ſtagger'd him ſome Steps backward, when, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to preſs upon him, I put one Foot behind, and he fell under me, with a horrible Squelch, upon the Sand; and, daſhing my Hand againſt his Forehead, I ſprung up lightly on my Feet.</p>
               <p>Here, the People repeated their Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which were echoed for a long Space from Side to Side; while I propoſed to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0237300103:193"/>the Judges that, if my Rival was not yet ſatisfied, I would give him the other Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But the Black was ſo far from being in Plight for a third Engagement, that he could not riſe without Help on either Hand; and the Prize, being a fine Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban with a Diamond Button, was put upon my Head.</p>
               <p>The Competitors for the Race then came from among the Crowd, being fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen in Number, lightly equipt for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and I alſo put on a thin Canvas Waiſtcoat that came cloſe to my Body.</p>
               <p>In the Front of the Throne, a long Pole was ſet up, from whence we were to ſtart; and another Pole was erected on the further Side, round which we were to run, and ſo return to the Poſt from whence we ſet out.</p>
               <p>We were all arranged in a Line, and <hi>Ali</hi> himſelf was to give the Word, when one of our Fellows, either thinking or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to think that the Word was given, ſtarted away, the reſt followed, and I was left alone, quietly ſtanding by the Poſt. Why don't you ſet out? ſaid <hi>Ali;</hi> when your Highneſs ſhall be pleaſed to give the Word. Away then! he cried, and away I ſprung.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0237300103:194"/>
As I found that I was gathering them up very faſt, I ſuſpended my Speed, and linger'd behind the hindmoſt, till they had all turned the Poſt, and extended in a long Line before me. I then ſtarted away, and paſſed one, and then another, till, having paſſed them all, I left the ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at a Diſtance behind me, and ſeized the Goal; whereon <hi>Ali</hi> himſelf gave a Cry of Admiration, which was anſwered, from all Sides, by all his People.</p>
               <p>I was then preſented with a Velvet Tunic, embroider'd with Gold; and ſome ſmaller Matters were given to the two who came next to me in Speed.</p>
               <p>The Candidates for the third Prize then roſe from the Ground where they had ſat to repoſe themſelves; for they were the ſame Perſons who had been Competitors in the Race. A ſcarlet Girdle was ſtretched along the Graſs, as a Mark from whence the Rivals were to ſet off on their Leap. And each of them took a Run, till they came to the appointed Limit, and then ſprung forward with their utmoſt Agility.</p>
               <p>As this, of all others, was the Article of bodily Exerciſe wherein I excelled, I ſtood by, as an unconcerned Spectator,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0237300103:195"/>till the Conteſt was over. I then meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my Eye the Length they had paſſed. Then, taking two Men, I ſet them in Mid-ſpace, and, placing a Pole upon their Heads, I took a run, and, throwing myſelf Head foremoſt over the Pole, I turned in the Air, and alighted ſix Inches beyond the furtheſt Leap; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I was preſented with a Collar adorned with Gems of great Luſtre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ali</hi> then ordered two Troops of his lighteſt Horſe to come forward. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they enter'd the Pale, and dividing, they retired to oppoſite Sides of the Liſts. The Populace then fell back and cleared the mean Space, and the young Officers ſet forward, on a half Gallop, at the Head of their Troops.</p>
               <p>Never did I ſee ſuch Action, ſuch Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. The Officers, as they rode ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forward, would toſs their Lances aloft and then catch them in mid Air; and again they would caſt them to a Diſtance before them, and ſtooping, take them from the Ground in the Midſt of their Speed.</p>
               <p>The Troops then met, as ſhould ſeem, in mortal Oppoſition; and, breaking their frail Lances againſt each other, they drew their Wooden Sabres, and each, paſſing his Adverſary, gave a back Stroke to his
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0237300103:196"/>Neck, with ſuch Force and Agility as was truly alarming. Their Ranks then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be broken on either Part. And, inſtantly, forming themſelves into little Rhombs, or Squares, or Wedges, they fought and mixed together, as in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Dance, with the moſt regular Confuſion that ever was beheld.</p>
               <p>This was juſtly delightful to all the Spectators; and I regretted their Departure, with the ridiculous Entrance of a third Pantomime.</p>
               <p>While this Droll was preparing, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Order from <hi>Ali,</hi> to dreſs myſelf in the Prizes which I had won, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him.</p>
               <p>I obeyed, and preſented myſelf before him. What is your Name, young Man? <hi>David,</hi> ſo pleaſe your Highneſs. Are you of Chriſt or of <hi>Mahomet, David?</hi> My Will is with Chriſt, ſo pleaſe you, but, while I confeſs him with my Lips, my whole Life has denied him. Then, <hi>David,</hi> if you will but forſake Chriſt, and turn to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> you ſhall be the Friend of <hi>Ali,</hi> and he will heap Treaſures, and Titles, and great Honours upon you. Ah, my Lord! I cried out, though I hold my Chriſt but by a frail and feeble Thread, yet I would not quit that Thread for a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0237300103:197"/>Chain of golden Links that ſhould bind the whole Wealth of the World to my Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And, why would your Highneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Service of a Traitor? He, who proves a Traitor to his God, ſo pleaſe you, can never prove true to any Maſter.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>David,</hi> ſaid he mildly, we may talk of theſe Matters hereafter. In the mean Space, before I do you any Grace, I ought at leaſt to do you Juſtice. You have already received the Rewards of your Valour and your Action, but you have not yet received the Reward of your Obedience. You were the only one, brave <hi>David,</hi> who, at the Riſque of your own Honour, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my Word, and here I give you an Earneſt of the Recompence that I intend you.</p>
               <p>So ſaying, he preſented me with a large and maſſive Sabre, whoſe Handle was ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Gems of great Value. I received it on my Knee, and he then continued, Aſk me now, <hi>David,</hi> what further Gift you demand, except your Diſmiſſion, and it ſhall be granted you, to a Tenth of the Treaſure in my Coffers.</p>
               <p>When he had ſpoken, my Eye was caught by one of his Retinue, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly I recollected the Features of the Pirate <hi>Barbar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0237300103:198"/>
I, inſtantly, caſt myſelf proſtrate before his Throne, and cried aloud, Ah, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Ali!</hi> may God multiply to you Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Bleſſings a thouſand fold! I aſk none of your Treaſures or Poſſeſſions, O <hi>Ali!</hi> I only aſk the Head of that Traitor, the Head of <hi>Barbar;</hi> I aſk but Blood for Blood: Let him reſtore to me my Friend, my Brother, my Lord <hi>Oſmyn;</hi> he is a Murderer, a Traitor, and ſuch I will prove him, by Night or by Day, by Sea or by Land, at any Weapons, againſt any Odds, I will prove him a Traitor.</p>
               <p>While I ſpoke, thus impaſſioned, all about appeared under the utmoſt Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and <hi>Barbar</hi> trembled and turned pale, but did not dare to quit his Station.</p>
               <p>Riſe, <hi>David,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ali,</hi> and tell me what Friend, what <hi>Oſmyn</hi> thou doſt mean? All I know of him, my Lord, is that his Name was <hi>Oſmyn</hi> of <hi>Petra,</hi> and that he was Nephew to ſome great Prince in this Part of the World.</p>
               <p>Why, you dream ſurely, <hi>David,</hi> replied the Regent, <hi>Oſmyn</hi> of <hi>Petra</hi> was my own Nephew; and he periſhed, with all his Crew, by the Hands of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0237300103:199"/>
He did not periſh by the Hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I cried; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers, his Friends, his Attendants, and he periſhed by the Hands of his own Countrymen, and more eſpecially by the Hands of this Traitor <hi>Barbar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, ſaid <hi>Ali,</hi> we have not Leiſure, at preſent, to examine into the Truth of theſe Allegations; Guards, take that <hi>Barbar</hi> into ſafe and cloſe Cuſtody till we are better informed, touching the Facts with which he is charged. Mean time, do you, <hi>David,</hi> follow in my Train, for you muſt take up your Lodging with me, this Night.</p>
               <p>The Place, though it appeared one uniform Edifice, was divided into two by an impaſſable Barrier. The one was the occaſional Habitation of <hi>Ali</hi> and his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants: And his Wives, with their Eunuchs, were lodged in the other, where it was Impalement for any Man, ſave <hi>Ali</hi> himſelf, to enter.</p>
               <p>The generous <hi>Ali</hi> was not of a jealous Temper. He gave his Women uncommon Liberties, as you have ſeen; for tho' they were kept, by their Veils, from the Eyes of the Vulgar; yet thoſe Veils were of ſo very thin a Gauze, that they could clearly diſcern every Object about them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0237300103:200"/>
For three Days and Nights, after I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd his Palace, though I was treated with an Attention that gave me much Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet I had not the Honour of being called to his Preſence.</p>
               <p>At length I was conducted by a private Door to his Cabinet. My Friend <hi>David,</hi> ſaid he, what haſt thou to tell me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my dear and brave Nephew <hi>Oſmyn?</hi> I then minutely, and at large, recited to him the Particulars above related And we ſhed many Tears, that were mutually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the Tears of each other.</p>
               <p>Having cloſed my Narration, he caſt his Eyes down, awhile, as in deep Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and raiſing them again, he ſaid, the Preſumptions are ſtrong, very ſtrong againſt this Man, and yet there is a Poſſibility that he may be guiltleſs. And though <hi>Oſmyn</hi> is my Nephew, my Blood, and almoſt my Bowels, yet Honour, Humanity demands of us, <hi>David,</hi> that nine Criminals ſhould eſcape the Puniſhment they deſerve, rather than one innocent Perſon ſhould periſh in his Righteouſneſs. But, the great <hi>Alla</hi> may give us further Lights in this Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>In about five Days after, a Convict was to be gaunched for the Rape and Murder of a free Woman. He was to be thrown
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0237300103:201"/>from the Top of a high Tower, from whoſe Walls projected ſeveral ſharp and ſhagged Inſtruments, reſembling Hooks, Scythes, Tenters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at certain Diſtances, ſome below others.</p>
               <p>He fainted ſeveral times as he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to Execution; and then, being in an Agony, he ſaid he had a Matter of the higheſt Conſequence to impart to the great <hi>Ali,</hi> and prayed to be brought directly into his Preſence.</p>
               <p>I was on the Spot when he was led in, and, looking earneſtly at him, recollected that he was the Ruffian who had ſpit in my Face and given me a Buffet when I enter'd <hi>Barbar</hi>'s Ship.</p>
               <p>Wretch, cried the Dey, what haſt thou to ſay to <hi>Ali?</hi> That I am guilty, anſwered the Convict, of Crimes more heinous and capital than that for which I am to ſuffer, of Crimes that nearly concern yourſelf, O <hi>Ali,</hi> but which you ſhall never know, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you ſwear to me, by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Manner of my Death. I do ſwear it, ſaid the Regent, provided the Diſcovery which you make ſhall be found of due Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               <p>He then depoſed that, on the Night, in which <hi>Oſmyn</hi> diſappeared, the Captain,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0237300103:202"/>with ten confederated Ruffians, of whom he was one, enter'd the Prince's Cabin, and, having muffled the Faces of him and his Attendant, to prevent their crying out, bound them Hand and Foot and heaved them, through the Window, into a Boat that waited for them. That then, getting into the Frigate, they maſſacred the ſeven <hi>Moors</hi> to whoſe Care ſhe had been left, and rifling her of all the Money and Plate and Valuables that they could find, they got into their Boat, and, ſinking the Frigate, with <hi>Oſmyn</hi> and his Attendant in her, they made Way, with Oar and Sail, to the neareſt Shore, where they divided their Plunder, and, ſtaving the Boat, made ſeparately off to different Regions.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Barbar</hi> was ſent for, and came in Chains, and attended by Guards, into the Preſence. But, as ſoon as he ſaw the Face of the Convict, without waiting to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted by his Evidence, he ruſhed violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with his Head foremoſt, toward the oppoſite Marble, and, if a Man, who was at Hand, had not caught him by the Chain, he would inſtantly have daſhed his Skull to Shivers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ali,</hi> hereupon, without further Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ordered the Head of the Convict to be ſtruck off in the Morning, and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> to be impaled in the Face of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0237300103:203"/>
Never was Joy like mine, on hearing this Sentence pronounced againſt <hi>Barbar;</hi> and I roſe early the next Morning in order to have the Pleaſure of being at his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He was ſo enfeebled by his Panicks, that they were obliged to draw him on a Sled to the Stake; and the muſcling of his Countenance had all the Impreſſions of Death, Deſpair and Hell repreſented upon it.</p>
               <p>This, however, did not affect me with any other Senſation than of that Delight which is naturally felt on the Gratification of Revenge, till the Executioners, with unfeeling Hearts and merry Tauntings, began to take the Wretch in Hand. But, when I ſaw them, with Difficulty and great Violence, thruſting the Stake through his Body, which they run up withinſide the ſpinal Bone and ſo out at the Back of his Neck, in order to avoid his Bowels and keep him the longer in Anguiſh; when I ſaw him writhing in Agony, and heared his horrible Roars and Groanings, all my Revenge was quickly turned into Terror and Compaſſion; his Pangs and Sufferings, as it ſeemed, were transferred to my own Perſon, and, had I not turned away, I ſhould have fainted on the Spot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0237300103:204"/>
The Dey, from this time, became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fond of me and familiar with me. He allotted me an affluent Penſion, with Slaves, Horſes and Attendants. He ſaid I ſhould be to him in the Place of a Nephew and of a Son, and he called me by the Name of <hi>David-Oſmyn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some time after, Tidings were brought that <hi>Caled Amurath</hi> of <hi>Fez</hi> was making mighty Preparations to invade his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. We will more than meet him Half way, cried the gallant <hi>Ali;</hi> perhaps we may even prevent his threatened Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He then ſummoned his Forces from all Quarters. I was preſent when he made a general Muſter of them. His Foot were more formidable for their Numbers than their Diſcipline; but his Horſe were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly trained, and made a moſt brilliant Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
               <p>The Day before he ſet out, I threw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his Feet. I will go with you, my Maſter, I will go with you, I cried. I will not have any Command or Poſt of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or Honour; I only deſire Permiſſion to fight by your Side, that you may witneſs how greatly I ſhall dare in your Cauſe; how ready I ſhall be to take, to my own Boſom, all the Weapons that ſhall be aimed at your Boſom, my Father!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0237300103:205"/>
No, <hi>David,</hi> he replied, my People know you are ſtill a Chriſtian. I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from ſhewing the Love I have for you; and that might be Matter of Jealouſy and Diſcontent to my Captains. I will leave you here a Band of Soldiers, with whom you are to encamp within Sight of my Palace, and to keep theſe Walls from Violence, and my Women from Pollution. But, while you are their Guardian, beware that you do not turn an Invader, <hi>David!</hi> I would pardon you any thing but this; I would not pardon you the Invaſion of my Bed, <hi>David-Oſmyn!</hi> No, my Lord, I cried aloud, I cannot prove ungrateful. Though your Women were as obvious to my Walks as yonder Pavement, and though adorned with more Graces than their firſt Mother in Paradiſe, they ſhould have no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for me, my Maſter!</p>
               <p>The next Morning <hi>Ali</hi> began his March; and having eſcorted him a Piece on his Way, I returned to my Charge.</p>
               <p>That Night, as I lay in my Tent, I began to call myſelf to Account. <hi>David,</hi> ſaid I to my Soul, thou haſt now gotten Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, and Riches, and Honours; thou art, as it were, the ſecond Man in the Realm, and all this People have thee in high Eſtimation: But, art thou the better
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0237300103:206"/>or the happier Man for all this, <hi>David?</hi> Far otherwiſe, far otherwiſe. O frail and vain Heart! theſe Gauds and theſe Glories have taken hold upon thee, and they have drawn a painted Veil between me and my God. To my Chain, and my Straw, and my Nakedneſs, return me to them, O Lord! return me to my Slavery, return me to my Labours! I was not then, indeed, gaining Conqueſts and winning Prizes; but I was near to obtaining <hi>the Prize of the High Calling.</hi> My Body was not then adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gold and Pearl; but my Spirit rejoiced in <hi>the Pearl of mighty Price!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In about five Weeks after, as I was taking, by Moonlight, my Evening's Walk of Meditation, on the Marble that chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the Pavement before the Palace, <hi>Muley,</hi> an old Black, and Chief of the Eunuchs of the Seraglio, came up and accoſted me. <hi>Oſmyn,</hi> ſaid he, taking a Bundle from under his Arm, I have here a Preſent for you, that would make proud the greateſt Emperor upon Earth. It is a compleat Suit wrought, purpoſely, for you by the Fingers of the Sultana, as alſo by the Fingers of her fair and princely Siſters. They ſaw your great Atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments during the Feſtival, and they ſend you this in Return for the Pleaſure which you gave them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0237300103:207"/>
So ſaying, he unfolded the Robes to the Moon. They were flower'd with needled Gold, and inlaid with Pearl and Gems of ſuch a vivid Luſtre as reflected her Beams with tenfold Brightneſs.</p>
               <p>And what is required of me, <hi>Muley,</hi> I demanded, in Return for this ineſtimable Honour and Bounty? Nothing, ſaid <hi>Muley,</hi> but a ſingle Hour's Attendance, to give them a ſhort Sketch of your Life and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Take back your Preſents, I cried, there is Poiſon and Death in them; I will not betray the Truſt that our Maſter has repoſed in me. Nay, ſaid <hi>Muley,</hi> I affirm to you that there is no ſuch Intention. Our Ladies are all Women of the ſevereſt Chaſtity. I will undertake to conduct and reconduct you back in ſafety. Neither can our Maſter be betrayed in any Degree. They all live together, they love like Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and no one keeps a Secret from the other. However, they deſired me to tell you that, if you are of a fearful Temper, they will not inſiſt on the Favour ſo much expected.</p>
               <p>Here, I felt myſelf piqued: No, <hi>Muley,</hi> I cried, I am no Coward. I can dare all honeſt Dangers. I will attend you. But, I will not ſtay, <hi>Muley.</hi> I will let your Ladies know, that, in the Cauſe of Honour and Virtue, I can reſiſt all Temptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0237300103:208"/>
I then called a diſtant Slave, who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Orders, and, giving him the Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, deſired him to lay it within my Tent. Where now, <hi>Muley?</hi> ſaid I. I will ſhew you, ſaid <hi>Muley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He then led me to a large Bucket, wherein Water was accuſtomed to be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by Pullies, to the Balcony, and there to be emptied into Veſſels that ſtood upon the Leads.</p>
               <p>You muſt not enter any Door of the lower Story, ſaid <hi>Muley;</hi> for there our Domeſtics inhabit, and might, probably, obſerve you. But, if you get into this Bucket, in a Minute or two after, I will raiſe you by the Pullies, and take you gently in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muley</hi> then went from me, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, on ſtriking at a diſtant Door; while I ſtood by the Bucket, and, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its firſt Motion, jumped in and was conveyed to the Top of the Palace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muley</hi> there received me in Darkneſs and Silence, and, taking me by the Hand, led me down by a few Steps, into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Apartment that was ſcarcely enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a glimmering Lamp. He there left me again, giving me only a whiſpering
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0237300103:209"/>Promiſe that he would quickly return. I waited for him long, however, under great Impatience of getting ſpeedily back again. At length he came, and, taking me by the Hand, without ſpeaking a Word, he led me through a long and dark Entry, till, coming to a folding Door, he touched a Spring, whereupon the Door flew open on either Side, and threw a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Blaze upon my dazzled Eyes.</p>
               <p>The Saloon, upon which it opened, was profuſely illuminated, and moſt ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly furniſhed; but my Attention was quickly called from ſuch inferior Objects. In the Midſt, a Board was cover'd with an elegant Collation of little Matters. Around it were placed a great Number of ſmall Sofas; and, behind each Sofa, ſtood a Lady richly adorned, but veiled from the Head to the Waiſt.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Muley</hi> led me to the further End, while I made low Obeyſance as I paſſed the Company. He then compelled me to ſit, where, by a ſmall Turn of my Head, I could have a full Proſpect of each Fair-one at Table. Then, as by one Motion, they were all inſtantly ſeated; and again, as by one Motion, they all, inſtantly, threw up their Veils, and I had like to have fallen backward with the Suddenneſs of the Luſtre that flaſhed upon my Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0237300103:210"/>
All the Ladies ſmiled, and ſeemed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted at my Aſtoniſhment. The Sultana <hi>Adelaide,</hi> ſat neareſt to me, on the Right; and was no way diſtinguiſhed from her Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but by a ſmall Coronet of feathered Diamonds that was inſerted in her lovely Locks. <hi>Oſmyn,</hi> ſaid ſhe, you ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſurprized; were you never in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio before? Have you no Seraglios in your Country, <hi>Oſmyn?</hi> No, Madam, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, we have no Seraglio in our Country; but ſure, no Seraglio, upon Earth, ever produced ſuch and ſo many Beauties as now ſtrike my Eyes. Heaven, alone, can exhibit ſuch a Conſtellation of Luminaries.</p>
               <p>Would you not wiſh then, ſaid <hi>Adelaide,</hi> to have ſuch a Seraglio of your own? No, Madam, I anſwered; without Love, in my Judgment, there can be no true Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if ever I love, it can be but the one Object, and her I ſhall love with my whole Heart; true Love will admit of no Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here, ſhe looked at me, with a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs that ſunk into my Soul, and, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out her Handkerchief, ſhe wiped away a ſwelling Tear.</p>
               <p>Another Lady then demanded if we had not a Woman Market, and if they were not Slaves in my Country as they were here? No, Madam, I replied, our Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0237300103:211"/>ones there, are not the Subjects of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, but the Objects of Admiration. No Woman in <hi>England</hi> can be bound to any Lover, ſave by her own Affections. There, it is Death for any Man to have more than one Wife, and that after a Suit, perhaps of ſeveral Years. A Lady there of equal Beauties to the leaſt excellent in Company, would be followed by Hundreds of humble and ſighing Adorers. In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> our Actions are as free as our Hearts; and the Senſibilities of mutual Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe of the Sexes, who feel the tender and enchanting Paſſion, conſtitute the principal Happineſs of which Life is capable.</p>
               <p>Happy Engliſhwomen, happy Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women! was echoed all around.</p>
               <p>Alas, cried the lovely <hi>Adelaide,</hi> how very different is our Fate! we are ſold, like ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Brutes, to any Brute of a Maſter. We neither love nor are beloved; as you now have convinced me, <hi>Oſmyn.</hi> We are ſubjected to vile Deſires, which we at once deteſt and ſuffer; and, when thoſe Deſires are gratified, we are caſt away as common Lumber, to make Room for ſome new Comer. Even high as I ſit here, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd Sultana of my Lord, I may To-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be appointed to the meaneſt Offices of his Houſhold. This, ſurely, cannot be a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0237300103:212"/>Marriage; for, as you have intimated, <hi>Oſmyn,</hi> and as I feel in my own Soul, Marriage can only conſiſt in an Union of Hearts. Love cannot be bought or ſold; it is of too precious a Nature; nothing can purchaſe, nothing compenſate, ſave its Value in Love alone.</p>
               <p>Here they preſs'd me to tell them my Story; and here I confeſs, to my Shame, that, however vile I appeared in my own Eyes, I was ambitious of appearing as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and deſerving as poſſible in the Eyes of the fair <hi>Adelaide.</hi> I, therefore, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed what was black, gloſſed over what was offenſive, and enlarged on every thing that I deemed advantageous in my own Character.</p>
               <p>The Night was far ſpent, by the Time I concluded; and the Sultana, ariſing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſhew me the Curioſities of an adjoining Cabinet. I accordingly attended her, and was aſtoniſhed at the Luſtre, the Richneſs, and Profuſion of the Jewels, as well as at the Miracles of Art that ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played before my Eyes.</p>
               <p>On our Return, we perceived that our Company had abſconded. <hi>Adelaide</hi> grew all Crimſon, and caſt down her Eyes. I, alſo, was confuſed, my Heart began to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0237300103:213"/>throb, and I looked about for ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to make a quick Eſcape. But—but—In ſhort, Gentlemen, neither my Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, nor Religion, nor Honour, nor Gratitude were of any avail againſt ſuch a Temptation; they fell together, an eaſy Victim to the all-conquering <hi>Adelaide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adelaide</hi> was the firſt to preſs my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. It was not yet Day. I found <hi>Muley</hi> in Waiting. We came by the Way we went, I ſtepped into the Bucket, and he let me gently down.</p>
               <p>As I approached the Pavement, I felt a Hand, behind, that ſeized me violently by the Shoulder. I ſprung out, and, ſeizing the Wretch by the Throat, would inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have plunged my Poniard into his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; but ſome Power as ſuddenly arreſted my Arm, and ſaid to my Heart, beware that thou add not Murder to Adultery, <hi>David!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While I heſitated, a Number ruſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me unaware, they griped me by each Arm, and, wreſting the Poniard from me, they bound my Hands behind, and led me to the Cells of the <hi>Imams</hi> that ſtood ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing aloof from one End of the Palace.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they had brought Lights, what, <hi>Oſmyn!</hi> exclaimed their Chief, can
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0237300103:214"/>this be our renowned <hi>Oſmyn?</hi> Is it thus that you repay the Favours of your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and kind Maſter? You are a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, cried another; has your <hi>Chriſt</hi> then taught you to betray the Confidence and Truſt that is repoſed in you? This was a home Stab; it went through my Heart; but I ſtood in a ſhamefaced Sullenneſs, and opened not my Lips.</p>
               <p>Here they went apart, and, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted awhile, returned. <hi>Oſmyn,</hi> ſaid their Chief, you are a brave and a wonderful Man, and it is a pity to loſe you. Your Secret is yet with us; and, we ſwear to you, by our holy Prophet, and by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>Alha,</hi> that if you perform the ſingle Condition we enjoin, we will bury what we know, in a Depth below the Grave, and we will recommend you to the Love of <hi>Ali,</hi> and the Acclamations of all the People, and we will have you loaded with Preferments, and Riches, and Honours. Name it quickly, I cried, whatever it may be, at the Riſque, at the Loſs of my Life, I will perform it. It is, ſaid he, no more than to abjure <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to confeſs <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> whoſe Prieſts we are, and all the Bleſſings of his Paradiſe ſhall be ſhower'd down upon you.</p>
               <p>Here I gave a deep Groan; and caſting down my Head, and ſhedding a ſilent
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0237300103:215"/>Tear, without daring to lift my Thoughts to Heaven; No, no, I cried, though <hi>Chriſt</hi> is nothing to me, though I have no Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him; though he ſpurns and has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected me, for Time, and for Eternity; though I have daily denied him by every Action of my Life; yet my Tongue ſhall never deny him. In Poverty and Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in Dangers and in Dungeons, in Death here, and in Hell hereafter, my Mouth ſhall confeſs him.</p>
               <p>Here, they went apart again, and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, told me, that I ſhould have two Days to deliberate on their Propoſal; but that, if I did not comply, I ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled alive on the third Morning, with all the additional Tortures that Art could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
               <p>They then put me into a cover'd kind of a Waggon and conveyed me to —, where I was caſt into a noiſome Dungeon, bolted down to the Ground with Irons, ſuſtained with coarſe Bread and Water, and not allowed a Ray of Light to divert my Thoughts from the Darkneſs and Horrors of my Situation.</p>
               <p>Mean time, I endeavoured to reinforce my Reſolution, by repeating to myſelf the ſacred Promiſe, where <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays, <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will confeſs me upon Earth, him will I
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0237300103:216"/>confeſs before my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Mine, indeed, ſaid I, is but a verbal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; but, even that, with what I am about to ſuffer for his Sake, may ſerve to make me leſs criminal, if not acceptable in his Sight.</p>
               <p>I then longed to be brought to the Teſt, while I ſhuddered at the Thoughts of it. At length the Day arrived. The <hi>Imams</hi> came, and once more repeated the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but I ſtill perſiſted, though in Terms that were ſcarcely intelligible, for my Tongue cleaved, with Terror, to the Roof of my Mouth.</p>
               <p>They then ſtripped me to theſe Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, out of which, alſo, they took my Money with other Valuables, and every thing except this inſignificant Walnut, and, having tied me to a Sled, I was dragged to the Place of Execution.</p>
               <p>The chief <hi>Imam</hi> once more aſked if I would renounce the Son of <hi>David?</hi> but I made him no Anſwer, for I was unable to ſpeak. I had ſeen the Preparations; the Stake in the Hands of the Executioners; the Fires kindled about me, with horrid Inſtruments ready to be put therein, for the tearing of my frying and quivering Fleſh from the Bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0237300103:217"/>
Could I then have had the Confidence to have turned my Soul to God, and to have beſought his Aſſiſtance in that trying and terrible Hour, I make no Queſtion but he would have given me Strength from on high, to defy all that Man or Devils could do unto me; and, I might now, in the Regions of his Bounty and his Bleſſedneſs, have been pouring forth my Exiſtence, in the grateful and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Senſe of his Mercy to ſuch a Sinner.</p>
               <p>But, when I reflected on the Wrythings of <hi>Barbar,</hi> the bare Sight of which my Spirit was not able to ſupport; when I ſaw ſuch an Apparatus of additional Torments; and when they took me in Hand, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Execution, I utterly loſt my Senſes; I ſhrunk inward with Fear, my Hairs ſtood on End with Horror; my Tongue found ſudden Utterance, and, I cried, Stay, ſtay, I will ſay, I will do whatever you enjoin.</p>
               <p>The Imam then began to pronounce a Form of Renunciation, which he ordered me to repeat after him; but, I was ſo panting and breathleſs, that they were obliged to get a Cordial for me to keep me from ſwooning.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as my Spirits were ſomething reſtored, the Imam again began his impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0237300103:218"/>Ceremony, and I make no Queſtion but I ſhould have gone through it, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abhorrent to my Soul; but, in that Inſtant, we hear'd diſtant Shouts and Cries, as of many People; the Sound of the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours drew nearer and nearer; and, ſoon after, we ſaw Numbers hurrying to and hurrying from the City. Their Words became, now, as diſtinct as they were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; <hi>Ali</hi> is ſlain. <hi>Ali</hi> is ſlain! was all the Cry; and <hi>Amurath</hi> comes in full March up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
               <p>Here, all turned ſuddenly from me, and, flying ſeveral Ways, left me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound and alone, ſitting cloſe by the Stake. Seeing this, I began to recover from the fearful and faint Condition in which I was; and, riſing, I made the beſt of my way to the Port. There I ſaw a long Boat juſt about to ſet off with a Number of Fellows, much in my own Plight, and, taking a Run, I ſprung from the Beach into the midſt of them.</p>
               <p>A Man then demanded, in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if I was one of the Ranſomed? Yes, ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ranſomed, I cried, wonderfully ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed indeed; whereupon, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtion, they ſet up their Sail, and, in about two Hours, we reached the Ship which the Conſul had appointed to take them in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0237300103:219"/>
For the Remainder of that Day, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a State that is hard to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. My Head and Stomach, at times, were diſordered by ſick Fits; and my Soul hovered in an aſtoniſhed and fearful Kind of Doze; as one not rightly awaked from a Dream of Horror.</p>
               <p>Toward Evening I threw myſelf down in the Hold, and ſunk into a State of utter Oblivion, as I had not ſlept for the three foregoing Nights and Days.</p>
               <p>The Day following I found my Body ſomething refreſhed, but the Situation of my Mind was like that of a diſturbed and tumbling Sea after a raging Storm. I looked around for Comfort, but no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort was near; I looked afar off for Hope, but no Hope came in Proſpect. The Senſe of Exiſtence became a Miſery under which I was not able to bear up; and, could I have had my Wiſh, Creation would again have been uncreated.</p>
               <p>During the Whole of our Voyage, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, very nearly, in this Diſtemper of Spirit. For, though, at Times, I would enter into the Frolics and jovial Humours of the Crew; yet my Merriment, at ſuch Seaſons, was a Merriment to Madneſs; and I would again ſink, precipitately, into
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0237300103:220"/>a Depth of Deſpondence, whoſe Darkneſs would admit no Ray of Conſolation.</p>
               <p>The Tempter would then urge me, by Dagger, or by Drowning, or by any Means, to get rid of a Being that only ſerved to torment me: But again, the Dread that I might not get rid of that Being, and that Death might plunge me into a Perpetuity of thoſe Pangs in which I ſaw the wretched <hi>Barbar</hi> agonizing, this deterred me from haſtening the Day of my horrid Doom, and ſo I waited in a gloomy and <hi>fearful looking out for Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would then call myſelf, at Dead of Night, before that terrible Judgment. Thou Fiend <hi>David,</hi> I would ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art thou ſunk in Guilt above all that ever were guilty? It was thy Fortune to get three good and kind Maſters, good and kind above thy Wants, and even up to thy Wiſhes; and all theſe thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, thou haſt ſpoiled and betrayed them. Even the Maſter of all Maſters, the Maſter who was my Freedom in the Midſt of my Captivity, I was on the Brink of denying the <hi>Jeſus</hi> alſo; nay, I did reject, I did deny him, I promiſed, I engaged, to reject and deny him; and he will reject thee; through Time, and through Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he will deny thee, <hi>David!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0237300103:221"/>
One Evening a fearful Tempeſt aroſe; and, while moſt of the Crew gave ſome of their little Matters to the Providore for Liquors, and ſat, drowning the Senſe of Danger, and profanely carouſing, at one End of the Ship; my Companions, who are preſent, were praying or ſinging Glory to God, in the other. Both Parties invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to join them, but I refuſed to be Partaker with either; for I could not abet, in others, that Wickedneſs which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and deteſted in myſelf; and I could not think of taking, into my execrable Mouth, the ſacred Name of that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to whom I had ſo lately turned a falſe Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. In the mean time, I held myſelf as the Refugee <hi>Jonas,</hi> whoſe Crimes had brought Perdition on all in the Veſſel; and I was on the Point of adviſing the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to caſt me out.</p>
               <p>At length the Tempeſt abated, but my Perturbations did not abate. I wiſhed to repent, but I deemed myſelf paſt the Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Repentance; and thus I continued in a State of Diſſatisfaction and Enmity againſt myſelf, againſt my God, againſt Man, and Woman kind.</p>
               <p>When the Conſtables entered, and, by the Order of Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> laid hold on ſuch a Number of my late Aſſociates; though
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0237300103:222"/>I thought that I did not care what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of me, yet Nature began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſert her Rights; I trembled and turned exceeding pale, as I ſuppoſe; all my Crimes came ruſhing together into my Memory; I imagined that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed before your Eyes alſo; and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, each Moment, to be ſeized, like my fellow Culprits, and thrown into a Dungeon. But, when I found that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Puniſhment, you propoſed to load me with your Bounties; all my Sins ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me the more exceedingly ſinful; your Goodneſs came, in a Heap, upon the Heap of my own Guilt; and I fell proſtrate at your Feet, as under the Weight of a Mountain.</p>
               <p>AS SOON as he had cloſed his Story; take Courage and Comfort to you, <hi>David,</hi> I cried. Your Caſe is not near ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as your conſcientious Fears have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Your Error lay in truſting to your own Senſe of Duty, and to the Strength of your own Powers for reſiſting Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, the beſt Man that ever breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with no better a Dependance, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably have fallen, as you did, <hi>David.</hi> You now know your own Weakneſs; you are taught, by repeated Experience, that, in or of yourſelf, you no more can ſtand againſt the Enemies of your Soul, when they aſſail you, than a Tree ſevered from
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0237300103:223"/>its Root, and barely ſet on End, can ſtand the Aſſaults of a coming Tempeſt. Keep therefore to your Root, <hi>David.</hi> Never dare, in your own Strength, to oppoſe yourſelf to a Reed. Apply to the Rock, my Friend, from whence you were hewn. Cling to him, repoſe upon him, put your whole Confidence in him; and then your Weakneſs ſhall become ſtronger than an Army with Banners; and neither Life nor Death, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things preſent, nor Things to come, ſhall be able to ſeparate you from the Love of God which is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While I ſpoke, his Eyes began to gliſten, the Cloud of his Countenance cleared, his Aſpect aſſumed a chearful Serenity, he could ſcarce have been known for the ſame Perſon; and he cried, I will, I will, once more ſeek to my God; do you, my Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pray him to permit my Approach; and in Life, or in Death, I never will let go my Hold of him any more. He then would, again, have caſt himſelf at my Feet, but I haſtened to prevent him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> ſaid I, I am going for <hi>France,</hi> and before I ſet out, I ſhould be greatly pleaſed to ſee you in ſome decent Way of Livelihood, Now, inſtead of the twenty Pounds, of which you held yourſelf ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0237300103:224"/>here are two hundred to make a kind of Beginning for you, and I ſhould be glad to know the Uſe you propoſe to make of this Money.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place, Sir, ſaid he, I will refund, to my two Maſters, all the Money of which I defrauded them, with full or double Intereſt, amounting, as I ſuppoſe, to ſeventy or eighty Pounds. And, in the next Place, I will return, to your Honour, every Penny of the Remainder; for indeed you ſhall not perſuade me to truſt myſelf with it. In my preſent Way of thinking, it would be of no more uſe to me than the Stones or Dirt of the Street. My State of Slavery and Labour was the only State of Happineſs that I have known ſince my Birth; and I dread, I ſhudder at the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Affluence. I am already but too rich, in having my Liberty. I am now in a free Country, and, therefore, Lord of my own Earnings. Matter of Labour is but Matter of Play to me. The Pay of a Porter, on the Spot where I am, will be too much of Opulence; it will give me a further Sufficiency to ſupply the Wants of the Needy, and the Cravings of the Beggar.</p>
               <p>My good <hi>David,</hi> my beloved Penitent, ſaid the worthy Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ſo ſaying
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0237300103:225"/>he took him moſt cordially by the Hand, how came you by that ſame Walnut, the only Remnant of all your Treaſures, which you called inſignificant, and have yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this Day? You are as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to his chief Butler, Sir, ſaid <hi>David,</hi> you bring my Faults fully into the Remembrance of your Servant.</p>
               <p>While the Sultana, as I told you, was ſhewing and diſplaying to me the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of her Cabinet, ſhe deſired me to take, thereout, whatever I held moſt rare or moſt eſtimable. But, as my covetous Fit was not then upon me, I turned my Eye on a few Walnuts that I ſaw in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and, taking one of them, ſaid, that I would keep it for her Sake. Swear to me then, ſhe cried, that you will never break or open it, till you get into your own Country. This was an eaſy Condition, and I inſtantly complied with it.</p>
               <p>Did you love the Sultana, <hi>David?</hi> Yes, Sir, to exceſs, as I am alſo perſuaded that ſhe loved me; and we vowed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marry, if ever it ſhould be our Fortune to regain our Liberty; and, bound or free, never to marry another.</p>
               <p>Let me look at your Walnut, <hi>David,</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> you are now under no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Injunction concerning it. Do not
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0237300103:226"/>break it, I beſeech you, then, Sir, ſaid <hi>David,</hi> becauſe I intend never to part with it. I will not break it, <hi>David,</hi> I will only open it with my Knife, and a little Matter of Iſinglaſs may ſoon repair the Breach.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> then took the Walnut, and having poiſed it, for ſome Time, in his Hand; I will give you a hundred Guineas, <hi>David,</hi> ſaid he, for your Hazard of what this Shell contains. I would take a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pence, Sir, ſaid <hi>David,</hi> if I was inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take your Money without giving Value. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> then took his Knife, and, dividing the Shell with the utmoſt Caution, I have a ſtrong Fancy, <hi>David,</hi> ſaid he, that I muſt ſoon raiſe the Market; and inſtantly produced a Diamond of the firſt Water and Magnitude.</p>
               <p>We all ſtarted back and looked aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>David</hi> was the only Perſon in Company who, neither by Word or Look, expreſſed the ſmalleſt Joy or Satisfaction on the Occaſion.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was a Jeweller, having inſpected the Stone awhile with much De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Admiration, Mr. <hi>David,</hi> ſaid he, I would offer you ſeventeen hundred Pieces for this Diamond, if I did not think my Offer conſiderably under the Value, but I
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0237300103:227"/>ſhall be a better Judge when I have put it in the Scales. Keep it, keep it, Sir, cried <hi>David,</hi> and heartily welcome, return me only the Shell, it is all I will accept of. Then, turning to me a pale and alarmed Aſpect, Ah! Sir, ſaid he, this is queſtionleſs another Device of the Tempter, I fear that I am not to get quit of my old Aſſociate ſo ſoon as I looked for. I do not think with you, <hi>David,</hi> in this Matter, I replied. I rather conceive that Providence hath ſent you this Treaſure at a Time that he ſees you will make a worthy Uſe of it. Oh, Sir, he cried, if it ſhall ever, again, be my Caſe to fall off from my God, I ſhall certainly run mad, or make away with myſelf. Why ſo, <hi>David?</hi> ſaid I. You muſt not expect, all on a ſudden, to jump into a ſinleſs State. Such a State is only for thoſe who have already <hi>fought the good Fight,</hi> who have <hi>finiſhed their Courſe,</hi> who have <hi>kept the Faith.</hi> Such a State is only for thoſe, in whom the Babe of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> is not only conceived, but grown up and become mature: Theſe, indeed, cannot ſin, but run, with a joyful and free Will, into all Sorts of Goodneſs, as a Stream is prone to run to its kindred and parent Ocean. But, as for ſuch as you and I, Brother <hi>David,</hi> we muſt be content to ſtruggle on, and to fall and riſe by Turns. And, though we ſhould fall an hundred times a Day, yea, and be ſore wounded
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0237300103:228"/>alſo, my <hi>David,</hi> yet we ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond, but turn as often to our Helper, in total Diffidence of ourſelves, and full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his Mightineſs. For he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to lift us up whenever he thinks good, and the Balm of <hi>Calvary</hi> is better than the Balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> to heal all our woundings.</p>
               <p>I will tell you another Secret, <hi>David,</hi> which I learned from a Saint who is now deceaſed. That the humbling State of frequent and conſcious Lapſes is more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and tending to higher Bleſſedneſs for Man, than the Firmneſs and Rectitude of an unfallen Angel, becauſe it ſaps Self-confidence and creaturely Dependance, and throws one wholly on the Baſe that pillars up Eternity.</p>
               <p>Here he catched at my Hand, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Lips upon it, what ſhall I render you, my Maſter, what ſhall I render you, he cried, for the Peace and Comfort which you have ſhed abroad through my Boſom? I may now draw near to the Throne of Compaſſion, heavy laden with all my Sins, that is to ſay, with all myſelf; and I will truſt to free Mercy for removing the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and to free Grace alone for any good that ſhall ever be in me.</p>

As it now grew late, we agreed that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould take <hi>David</hi> home in his own Coach, and that I ſhould take <hi>Thomas</hi> with me in a Hackney; and I gave their remaining Comrades an Order for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Guineas <hi>per</hi> Man.</p>
               <p>When we were juſt upon ſeparating, <hi>Thomas</hi> caught <hi>David</hi> about the Neck. O my dear <hi>David,</hi> ſaid he, I ſhall ſurely never dare to judge any Man again; for I held you to be a very Reprobate, when you were, fifty times over, a better Man than myſelf. Hereupon I wiſhed Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>David</hi> a good Night, and, making <hi>Tirlah</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> go into the Coach before me, my two Servants light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us Home with, each, a Torch in his Hand.</p>
               <p>As I entered the Houſe, Mrs. <hi>Tirrel</hi> met me with a ſudden Joy in her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. My dear Sir, ſhe cried, I began to be in Trouble about you; I have kept Supper back this long Time. Then, ſaid I, let us have it as ſoon as you pleaſe; for I have here brought a dear Friend home with me.</p>
               <p>I placed the Twins directly oppoſite to each other at Table, and I made <hi>Tirlah</hi> and young <hi>James</hi> ſit down along with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0237300103:230"/>
While I was pleaſingly employed in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the mutual Emotions of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Siſter; they looked eagerly at each other, they both changed Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and neither of them offer'd to taſte a Bit. Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſaid I, why don't you eat? <hi>Thomas! Thomas!</hi> cried the Siſter, in a quick and paſſionate Accent; it may be—it may be—O!—my Brother!</p>
               <p>So ſaying, ſhe gave a Jump which, for the World, ſhe could not have done at any other Time. Over tumbled the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Meat, Diſhes, and Plates; while ſhe catched and clung about her Brother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out caſting a Thought away upon the Ruins that ſhe had wrought. O my <hi>Tommy,</hi> O my <hi>Nelly!</hi> my <hi>Tommy,</hi> my <hi>Nelly!</hi> was all that was uttered in the Midſt of their Careſſes. They ſaw no one but each other; they heard no one but each other; and I would gladly loſe or give a thouſand Suppers, to be feaſted as I was at that Seaſon.</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> came to this Part of his Story, a Meſſenger entered in fearful Haſte, and delivered a Letter to Lady <hi>Maitland.</hi> As ſoon as ſhe had run it over, my deareſt Sir, ſhe cried, I muſt leave you this Inſtant. I lately made you an
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0237300103:231"/>Offer of a hundred thouſand Pounds, and now I know not that I have ſo many Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings upon Earth. I am here informed that the Truſtee of all my Affairs has abſconded and made his Eſcape to <hi>France;</hi> but I muſt hurry to Town, and enquire into this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So ſaying, ſhe courteſied and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrew, without giving her Couſin Time to make a Tender of his Services.</p>
               <p>The next Morning, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> order'd his Chariot to the Door, and haſten'd to attend her Ladyſhip at her Houſe in <hi>London;</hi> but, there he was told that ſhe had ſet out for <hi>Dover</hi> about an Hour before, and he returned, much dejected and grieved on her Account.</p>
               <p>In about three Weeks after, Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> with his young Pupil, came home, quite lightened of the Money they had taken abroad. Mr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> for ſo we ſhall call him again, gave <hi>Clement</hi> a friendly Embrace, and took <hi>Harry</hi> to his Careſſes as though he had returned from a long and dangerous Voyage.</p>
               <p>Well <hi>Clement,</hi> ſaid Mr, <hi>Fenton,</hi> what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count have you to give us of your Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? An Account, Sir, that would be extremely diſpleaſing to any Man living ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yourſelf, in ſhort our young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, here, has plunged you above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0237300103:232"/>Pounds in Debt, over the large Sums that we carried with us. I hope the Objects were worthy, ſaid Mr. <hi>Fenton;</hi> wonderfully worthy, indeed, Sir; I never ſaw ſuch ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and affecting Scenes. Then I ſhall be overpaid and enriched by the Narration.</p>
               <p>Here, <hi>Harry</hi> enquired impatiently for Mrs. <hi>Clement</hi> and his Friend <hi>Ned,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told that they were on a Viſit to the Widow <hi>Neighbourly,</hi> he took a haſty Leave for the preſent, and away he flew to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was gone, Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> I cannot think that there is, in the World, ſuch another Boy as yours. I will leave to himſelf the Detail of our Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the ſeveral Priſons; they had ſuch an Effect on his Heart, that they cannot but have made a deep Impreſſion on his Memory; ſo I ſhall only tell you of what happened in our Way to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we were chatting and walking leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly along the Road, a poor Man before us happen'd to drop in a Fit of the Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When <hi>Harry</hi> ſaw the Writhings and Convulſions in which he lay, he turned pale and looked vaſtly frightened, and, ſeizing me under the Arm, he cried, come, come away! and hurried me off as faſt as he could. But we had not gone far, till
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0237300103:233"/>his Pace began to abate, and ſtopping, and heſitating, let us turn, let us turn, Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> he cried, let us go back again and help the poor Man! We then returned haſtily, and, raiſing his Head, we kept him from bruiſing it againſt the Ground. I then forced open his clenched Hands, and, having chafed the Palms awhile, he began to recover, and ſoon came to himſelf. Meanwhile <hi>Harry</hi>'s Fright was not yet quite over. He ſeemed willing to get away from the Object of his Terror, and, putting his Hand in his Pocket, and giving him all the Silver he had, he wiſhed him better Health, and away we went.</p>
               <p>We had not gone above Half a Mile further, when I ſaw a little Girl, in a Field on the right Hand, endeavouring to drive a Cow through a ſmall Gate into the Road, in Order to be milked, as I ſuppoſe, by her Mother; but the Cow kicked up her Heels and proved wanton and refractory, and ran hither and thither, and would not be guided. The poor Child then ſet up a Cry of as bitter Diſtreſs, as if all that was valuable in the World was going to ruin. <hi>Harry</hi> gave a ready Ear to the Sound of Lamentation, and ſeeing the Plight that the poor Thing was in, he ſuddenly croſſed the Road, above Ankle deep in Dirt, and, leaping the Ditch, he proved nimbler than the Cow, and, driving her through
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0237300103:234"/>the Paſs, he turned her into the Way that the Child would have her go.</p>
               <p>That Morning, indeed, was to <hi>Harry</hi> a Morning of petty Adventures. By the time that we approached the Suburbs, we had nearly overtaken a grown Girl who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Baſket of Eggs on her Head. A great lubberly Boy, juſt then, paſſed us by at a ſmart Pace, and, tripping up to the Girl, gave the Baſket a Tip with his Hand, and daſhed all the Eggs into Maſh againſt a ſtoney Part of the Road, and, again taking to his Heels, run on as before. Immediatly <hi>Harry</hi>'s Indignation was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and, ſetting out at top Speed, he ſoon overtook him, and gave him ſeveral ſmart Strokes with his little Cane, acroſs the Shoulders. The Fellow then turned upon <hi>Harry</hi> and gave him a furious Blow with his Fiſt over the Head, while I haſten'd to his Relief, as I perceived that the other was quite an Overmatch for him. But, before I arrived, our Hero had put a quick End to the Combat, for, ſpringing from the Ground, he darted his Head full into the Noſe and Mouth of his Adverſary, who inſtantly roared out, and, ſeeing his own Blood come pouring down, he once more took to Flight, while <hi>Harry</hi> continued to preſs upon him, and belaboured him at Pleaſure, till he judged that he had beaten him to the full Value of the Eggs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0237300103:235"/>
Meanwhile the poor Girl, wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of what paſſed, remained wailing and wringing her Hands over the Wreck of her Merchandiſe. The Voice of a Syren could not ſo powerfully have attracted and recalled <hi>Harry</hi> from the Length he had gone; he returned with Speed to her, and I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. My poor Girl, ſays he, where were you going with thoſe Eggs? To Market, Maſter, ſays ſhe: And what did you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to get for them? About five Shillings, Sir, and I had promiſed my Daddy and Mammy to lay it out in Shoes and Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for my little Brothers and Siſters; and ſo, I muſt now hear all the Blame of the poor Things going barefoot. Here, ſhe again ſet up her Wailings, and her Tears poured down afreſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harry</hi> then deſired me to lend him ten Shillings, and turning to the Mourner, hold out your two Hands, my poor Girl, he cried. Then, putting five Shillings into each Hand, here is the Payment for your Eggs, ſaid he; and here are five Shillings more, though I fear it is too little, to pay you for all the Tears they coſt you.</p>
               <p>Never did I ſee ſo ſudden, ſo great a Change in any Countenance. Surprize, Gratitude, Ecſtaſy flaſhed from her Eyes, and gave a joyous Fluſh to the muſcling
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0237300103:236"/>of her Aſpect. She hurried her Money into her Boſom, and dropping on her Knees in the Dirt, and ſeizing hold of <hi>Harry</hi>'s Hand, ſhe ſqueezed and kiſſed it repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without being able to utter a Word. While <hi>Harry</hi>'s Eyes began to fill, and, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to diſengage himſelf, he made off as faſt as he could, from ſuch Thanks as he thought he had no Way deſerved.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, was the laſt of our Adventures going to <hi>London.</hi> But, had you ſeen us, on our Return, about two Hours ago, you would have wonder'd at the mirey Plight into which we were put, by helping Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fengers up with their Bundles, that had tumbled into the Dirt; or by aſſiſting to raiſe Cattle that had fallen under their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; for Maſter <hi>Harry</hi> would compell me to be as buſy and active, in Matters of Charity, as himſelf.</p>
               <p>However, Sir, I am to tell you, that Maſter <hi>Harry,</hi> with all his Excellencies of Perſon, Heart, and Underſtanding, will be accounted a mere Ideot, among People of Diſtinction, if he is not permitted to enter into ſome of the faſhionable Foibles and faſhionable Vices of the Age.</p>
               <p>We were taking a Walk in the Mall, when we were met by the Earl of <hi>Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> who expreſſed great Joy at ſeeing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0237300103:237"/>Maſter <hi>Harry,</hi> his old Acquaintance, as he called him, and he preſſed us ſo earneſtly to Dinner that we could not, in Manners, refuſe him.</p>
               <p>There was a vaſt Concourſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, more eſpecially of the little Quality of both Sexes, who came to pay their Reſpects to young Lord <hi>Bottom</hi> and his Siſter the Lady <hi>Louiſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harry</hi> was received and ſaluted by Lady <hi>Mansfield</hi> and the young Lord, without any Appearance of the old Animoſity. Some time after Dinner, a large Pacquet of Letters was brought into the Earl, and, making his Excuſe to <hi>Harry</hi> alone, he roſe from the Table and retired to his Cloſet.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Bottom</hi> and his Siſter then led the young Males and Females to an adjoining Apartment, where ſeveral Card-tables were laid; and I began to tremble for the Credit of my Pupil, on the Occaſion, as I knew him to be a Novice in ſuch Matters.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the remaining Ladies and Gentlemen divided into two or three Parties at Ombre; and I ſaunter'd about the Room, admiring the Prints of the <hi>Ariadne,</hi> and the <hi>Aurora</hi> that were taken from <hi>Guido,</hi> as alſo ſome capital Paintings that the Earl had brought from <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0237300103:238"/>
I had ſpent above an Hour in this pleaſing Amuſement, and had nearly made the Tour of the whole Dining-Room; when, as I ſtood, at a little Diſtance behind my Lady's Chair, ſeemingly inattentive to any thing that paſſed, Lord <hi>Bottom</hi> enter'd on Tiptoe, and, tripping up to his Mother and tittering and whiſpering in her Ear; what do you think, Mamma, ſaid he; ſure, Maſter <hi>Fenton</hi> is a Fool, a downright Fool, upon my Honour. He does not know a ſingle Card in the whole Pack, he does not know the Difference between the Ace of Hearts and the Nine of Clubs. I don't think either that he knows any thing of the Difference or Value of Coin; for, as we paſſed through the Hall to Day, a Beggar aſked for a Halfpenny, and I ſaw him ſlip a Shilling into his Hand. Indeed, Mamma, he is the greateſt Fool that ever I knew; and yet, poor Fellow, he does not ſeem to know any thing of the Matter himſelf.</p>
               <p>During this Oration of Lord <hi>Bottom,</hi> on the Virtues of his new Friend, I felt my whole Body glow and tingle with Concern; and, ſoon after, <hi>Harry</hi> enter'd with the reſt of the ſmall Quality. Maſter <hi>Fenton,</hi> cries my Lady, I beg to ſpeak with you. Don't you know the Cards, my Dear? No, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Madam. Can't you play at Dice? No, Madam. Can you play Draughts, or
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0237300103:239"/>Poliſh, or Cheſs? Not at all, Madam. Why then, my Dear, I muſt tell you, that all your Father's Fortune will never intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you among People of any Breeding or of any Faſhion. Can you play at no Kind of Game, Maſter <hi>Harry?</hi> A little at Fox and Geeſe, Madam: And pray, my Dear, ſaid my Lady ſmiling, which of the Parties do you eſpouſe? The Part of the Geeſe, Madam. I thought as much, pertly cried out my Lord <hi>Bottom,</hi> whereupon a loud Laugh was echoed through the Room.</p>
               <p>Here, my Lady chid the Company, and calling <hi>Harry</hi> to her again, for he had gone ſomething aloof, Tell me, I pray you, ſaid ſhe, why you eſpouſe the Part of the Geeſe? Becauſe, Madam, I always wiſh that Simplicity ſhould get the better of Fraud and Cunning.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs here looked aſtoniſhed, and having gazed awhile at him, and caught and kiſſed him eagerly; You are a noble Fellow, ſhe cried, and all muſt be Fools or mad that ever ſhall take you for the one or the other.</p>
               <p>The elder Gentry, here, laid their Cards aſide, and deſired the young Ones to ſet about ſome Play. Lady <hi>Louiſa</hi> propoſed Draw-Gloves, or Queſtions and Commands, and to it they went.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0237300103:240"/>
Among the Females was one Miſs <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh,</hi> ſole Heireſs to a vaſt Fortune. Though her Perſon was deformed, her Face was the very Picture of confident Diſdain; and ſcarce any one could ſpeak to her, or look at her, without being told of the Contempt ſhe had for them, by the Side-Glance of her Eye, the Writhing of her Neck, and toſſing up of her Head.</p>
               <p>In the Courſe of the Play, our <hi>Harry</hi> was commanded to put the Candle into the Hand of Miſs <hi>Uppiſh,</hi> and then to kiſs the Candleſtick, which Command he obeyed literally, by giving her the Candle and kiſſing the Candleſtick which he held in his own Hand.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, a great Shout was ſet up in the young Aſſembly, and, O the Fool, the ſenſeleſs Creature, the Fool, the Fool, the Fool, was repeated throughout; while Lord <hi>Bottom</hi> laughed, and danced about in the Impatience of his Joy.</p>
               <p>I was amazed that <hi>Harry</hi>'s Countenance ſeemed no Way diſconcerted by all this Ridicule. At length Lady <hi>Mansfield</hi> called him to her. How, my Dear, could you be guilty of ſuch an Error, ſhe ſaid; did not you know that, when you gave the Candle into the Hand of the young Lady,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0237300103:241"/>ſhe became the Candleſtick, and it was her you ſhould have kiſſed. <hi>Harry</hi> then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to her Ladyſhip's Ear, and, in a pretty loud Whiſper, ſaid, I did not like the Metal, Madam, that the Candleſtick was made of. Again Lady <hi>Mansfield</hi> looked ſurprized, and ſaid, you are a ſly Rogue, a very ſly Rogue, upon my Honour, and have Senſe enough to dupe the wiſeſt of us all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jemmy Bottom,</hi> cried my Lady aloud, come here! I can't but tell you, <hi>Jemmy,</hi> that you have behaved yourſelf extremely ill to your young Friend here, who might have improved you by his Example as much as he has honour'd you by his Viſit. I muſt further tell you, <hi>Jemmy Bottom,</hi> that, whenever you pique yourſelf on degrading Maſter <hi>Fenton,</hi> you only pride in your own Abaſement, and glory in your Shame. Hereupon, I got up and, leaving our Compliments for the Earl, I carried off my young Charge, for fear of our falling into any further Diſgrace.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Harry</hi> is abroad, ſaid Mr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> be pleaſed to give me a general Sketch of the Manner in which you diſpoſed of your Money. In the firſt Place, Sir, anſwered <hi>Clement,</hi> you will find, by this Liſt, that, for little more than the five hundred Pounds allotted, we releaſed ninety five Priſoners,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0237300103:242"/>whoſe Debts amounted from forty Shillings to about twelve Pounds <hi>per</hi> Man. Theſe, in the general, had been Journeymen Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors or Weavers, or Profeſſors of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Crafts; and, as they wanted Means or Encouragement for exerciſing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Occupations in Gaol, they ſubſiſted on the Pence which they got by begging at the Grates, or on their Dividends of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Sums, which were ſent for their Relief by charitable Individuals. Nearly all of them were thin in Fleſh, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſhabby in Clothing, and yet they could hardly be ſaid to excite Compaſſion, as they appeared ſo chearful, and unfeeling of their own Wretchedneſs. Neither was there one of them, that I could learn, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Circumſtance of whoſe Story was worth reciting.</p>
               <p>Some, however, were of a Quality much ſuperior to this Claſs. Among others, there was a <hi>French</hi> Marquis and a <hi>German</hi> Prince; the Prince had been put under Arreſt by his Caterer, and the Marquis by his Taylor; ſo that, ſomething leſs than fifty Pounds ſet them both at Liberty.</p>
               <p>While the Keeper of the Fleet Priſon was making out a Liſt, for us, of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Debtors, <hi>Harry</hi> and I took a Turn about the Court, and obſerved two Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, in Liveries, bearing ſeveral ſmoaking
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0237300103:243"/>Covers, up the Stone Stairs, to a front Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room. This ſurprized me, and gave me the Curioſity to enquire what Priſoner it could be who lived in ſo expenſive and ſuperb a Manner. Sir, ſaid the under Keeper, there are few Men, now at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, near ſo wealthy as this Gentleman, who has done us the Honour to ſet up his Staff of Reſt in our Houſe. His Name is <hi>Sink.</hi> He is an Attorney and an old Bachelor, turned of ſixty Years of Age. He is in for ſeveral Sums, amounting to upward of nine thouſand Pounds, and he is reputed to be worth above double that Money.</p>
               <p>During the laſt twenty Years, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf with the ſtricteſt Probity toward all Men, and with the ſtricteſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Piety toward God. In the dark, in Froſt and Snow and all Inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Weather, he never miſſed attending Morning Service at Church. He was equally ſolicitous to be at Evening Prayer; and, whatever Company he chanced to have with him, or, how important ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Buſineſs in which he was engaged, the Moment he hear'd the Bell ring, he would huddle up his Papers and break away without Ceremony. He was eager in his Enquiries to know where the Sacrament was ſooneſt to be adminiſtered, and he never miſſed Receiving at leaſt once in the Week. Whenever he hear'd any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0237300103:244"/>or Obſcenity in the Streets, he would ſtop to reprove and expoſtulate with the Offender. In ſhort, he ſo perfectly counterfeited or took off, as they call it, the real Chriſtian, that many looked to ſee him, like <hi>Enoch</hi> or <hi>Elijah,</hi> taken alive into Heaven.</p>
               <p>This perpetual Parade of Sanctity gave him ſuch an Eclat and unmeaſurable Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, that he was left Truſtee and Executor in a Multitude of Wills; and Numbers alſo depoſited their Subſtance in his Hands, in order to be laid out at Intereſt on Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſo forth.</p>
               <p>Three Months ſince, about the Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as his Butcher happen'd to paſs by his Door, he hear'd it open, and turning, ſaw a Number of Porters come out heavy laden. This gave him a Kind of Suſpicion. He let them all paſs, and, walking ſoftly after, he ſtepped up to the hindmoſt and offered him Half a Crown, on Condition of his telling him where they were carrying thoſe Parcels. That I will, ſaid the Porter, for the Secret, if ſuch it is, is nothing to me you know. In ſhort we are carrying them to the Wharf to be put on board a Boat that waits to take them in.</p>
               <p>The Butcher ſaid no more, but hurried away to the Baker, and, as they both run
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0237300103:245"/>to the Office, they met the Brewer by the Way. They took out their reſpective Actions, and, taking a Conſtable with them, they ſeized on good Mr. <hi>Sink,</hi> as he was ſtepping into a Coach and Six to make the beſt of his Way to <hi>Dover.</hi> He would have paid them their Money and diſcharged their Actions on the Spot; but here the Maſter, in whom he truſted, happened to leave him in the lurch. As he had turned all his Effects into Money, and his Money into Paper, he had not at Hand wherewith to pay his inſtant Creditors. So they hurried him to Gaol, and, before the Banks were open, the Matter was blown, and Action after Action came pouring faſt upon him.</p>
               <p>When he found himſelf thus at Bay, he caſt aſide his Diſguiſe and ſet them all at Defiance. His Creditors have ſince offered to accept ten Shillings, and ſome of them to accept five Shillings in the Pound; but he ſwears that he will never pay them a Groat; for he is now as liberal of his Oaths and impious Execrations, as he was lately of his more impious Profanation of Goſpel Phraſes. And thus he daily revels in the ſenſual Conſumption of thoſe Wretches whom he hath ſo inhumanly defrauded, while Hundreds of Orphans and Widows, and other Miſerables periſh for want of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0237300103:246"/>the Suſtenance, which one infernal Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite devours without Remorſe. Nay, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Creditors are, at this very time, famiſhing in this Priſon, while they ſee him feaſting ſo laviſhly upon their Spoils.</p>
               <p>The Gorge of my Soul, cried Mr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the very Gorge of my Soul riſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this <hi>Daemon.</hi> Can nothing be done to bring him to Puniſhment? Our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſurely interfere in ſuch a calling Exigence; they will ſend to the ſeveral Banks, and take up all the Depoſits that have been made in his Name. Alas, Sir, ſaid <hi>Clement,</hi> he was already aware of ſuch Poſſibilities, and has enter'd all his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in feigned Names, and to Bearer upon Demand.</p>
               <p>Indeed, continued <hi>Clement,</hi> I heartily wiſhed, at the time, that the Laws of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> had been in Force among us, where the Debtor was given up to be ſet to Labour, whipped or tortured at the Pleaſure of the Creditor.</p>
               <p>God forbid, God forbid, exclaimed Mr. <hi>Fenton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we ſee Mankind divided into the <hi>Rich</hi> and the <hi>Poor,</hi> the <hi>Strong</hi> and the <hi>Weak,</hi> the <hi>Sound</hi> and the <hi>Sickly,</hi> we are
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0237300103:247"/>apt to imagine, that <hi>Health, Strength,</hi> or <hi>Opulence,</hi> was given to Thoſe; and <hi>Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Want,</hi> or <hi>Weakneſs</hi> appointed to Theſe, as Marks of the peculiar Favour or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour of Providence.</p>
               <p>GOD, however, knows that there is nothing permanently good, or evil, in any of theſe Things. He ſees that nothing is a Good but Virtue, and that nothing is a Virtue, ſave ſome Quality of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. On Benevolence, therefore, he builds the Happineſs of all his intelligent Creatures; and, in this our mortal State, (our ſhort Apparatus for a long Futurity) He has ordained the relative Differences of <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Poor, Strong</hi> and <hi>Weak, Sound</hi> and <hi>Sickly,</hi> &amp;c. to exerciſe us in the Offices of that Charity, and thoſe Affections, which, reflecting and reflected like mutual Light and Warmth, can alone make our Good to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>BENEVOLENCE produces and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the Heaven, or Beatitude of GOD himſelf: He is no other than an infinite and eternal GOOD WILL: Benevolence muſt, therefore, conſtitute the Beatitude or Heaven of all dependent Beings, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever infinitely diverſified through ſeveral Departments and Subordinations, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſeveral Natures and Capacities of Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0237300103:248"/>
GOD has appointed human <hi>Power</hi> and human <hi>Wealth,</hi> as a ready and ſufficient Fund for human <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs;</hi> to which Fund, therefore, they have as good a Right to reſort, as any other Creditors have to reſpective Truſt or Depoſits; for, though Poverty and Weakneſs are not Creditors, by the Laws of Man, they are Creditors by the eternal Laws of Nature and Equity; and muſt, here, or hereafter, bring their Debtors to account.</p>
               <p>Every Man, when he becomes a Member of this or that Society, makes a Depoſit of three ſeveral Sorts of Truſts, That of his LIFE, that of his LIBERTY, and that of his PROPERTY.</p>
               <p>Now as every Man, in his ſeparate or independent State, has by Nature the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Diſpoſal of his Property, he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Diſpoſal thereof, to Society, as amply and abſolutely as he was, in his ſeparate Right, entitled thereto.</p>
               <p>This, however, cannot be ſaid of his Life, or of his Liberty. He has no Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Right to take away his own Life; neither to depart from his own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: He cannot therefore convey to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, a Right and Authority which he hath not in himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0237300103:249"/>
The Queſtion then occurs, by what Right it is, that the Legiſlative and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive Powers of Community, appoint ſome Perſons to Death, and others to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment? My Anſwer is ſhort, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
               <p>It is the Right, perhaps the Duty, of every Man, to defend his Life, Liberty, and Property, and to kill or bind the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempters. This Right he can, therefore, convey; and, on ſuch Conveyance, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Right and Duty of the Truſtees of Society, to put to Death, or impriſon all who take away, or attempt the Life, Liberty, or Property of any of its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>This Right, however, extends to <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Matters,</hi> only; and it does not, yet appear to me, upon what Reaſon, or right Rule, founded in Nature or Policy, the ſeveral Societies of Mankind have agreed to deliver up their Members, to Slavery, to Stripes, Tortures, or Impriſonment, for Matters <hi>merely Civil,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Debts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several of the States of <hi>Greece,</hi> though accounting the reſt of the World as Barbarians; and even the <hi>Roman Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,</hi> during the Times of its moſt boaſted Policy and Freedom, gave up Inſolvent
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0237300103:250"/>Debtors (without enquiring into the Cauſes or Occaſions of ſuch Inſolvency) as Slaves, or abſolute Property, into the Hands of their Creditors, to be ſold at Will, or put to Labour, or ſtarved, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated or tortured, in order to give Value, in Vengeance, which they could not give in Coin, or other equivalent Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſufficiently, as <hi>CHRIST</hi> ſays, for <hi>the Hardneſs of that People's Hearts,</hi> yet gave perfect Enlargement to all <hi>Jews</hi> who were Bondmen, and perfect Remiſſion to all <hi>Jews</hi> who were perſonal Debtors, on every ſeventh or ſabbatical Year: And on every ſeventh ſabbatical Year, or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee, all Priſons were thrown open; all Slaves, though Foreigners or Aliens, ſet at Liberty; and even the Lands were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed, however mortgaged, or labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Debt and Execution; that all Things, animate or inanimate, might have an Earneſt of that Immunity, and perfect Freedom, which God originally intended, and keeps in Store for his Creatures.</p>
               <p>The Laws of <hi>Egypt</hi> permitted no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to deprive the Public of the Life, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, or Labour, of any other Member, except he were a Criminal, not fitting to live, or to be ſuffered to walk at large. In
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0237300103:251"/>all Caſes of Debtor and Creditor, they equitably appointed Value for Value, as far as the Subſtance of the Debtor could reach; and, in Caſe of Inſufficiency, the inſolvent Party was obliged to leave, in Pledge, the <hi>Mummies,</hi> or preſerved Bodies of his deceaſed Anceſtors, till, by Induſtry or good Fortune, either He, or his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſhould be enabled to redeem them. A Matter of refined, as well as charitable Policy; as nothing was held more infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> than their Inability to produce the Mummies of their Forefathers.</p>
               <p>The Laws of <hi>Holland,</hi> by their late Qualifications, ſeem to acknowledge the Iniquity, or Inadequateneſs, of depriving a Man of the <hi>Poſſibility of earning,</hi> merely becauſe he has not an <hi>immediate Ability to pay.</hi> Senſible, therefore, that all Men are Debtors to GOD, and reciprocally Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Creditors to each other, they have ordained, that He, who impriſons an inſolvent Debtor, ſhall pay the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Penalty, of his Malevolence or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, by maintaining the Party, from whom he takes the Ability of maintaining himſelf.</p>
               <p>It muſt be admitted, that, were our Laws leſs ſevere with Reſpect to Debtors; were People leſs afraid of a Jail on failure
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0237300103:252"/>of Payment; there would be leſs Credit, and, conſequently, leſs Dealing, in this, ſo wonderouſly wealthy, and trading a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if our Credit were leſs, ſhould not our Extravagance leſſen alſo? Should we ſee ſuch princely Tables among People of the lower Claſs; ſhould ſo much Claret, Spirits, and Ale, intoxicate a Kingdom; ſhould we ſee the Value of a <hi>German</hi> Prince's Ranſom gorgeouſly attiring each of our Belle Dames, if neither Merchant, Butcher, Brewer, Laceman, Mercer, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liner, nor Taylor would truſt?</p>
               <p>Many of our poor City Dealers are yearly undone, with their Families, by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting Perſons, who are <hi>privileged not to pay,</hi> or whoſe Remoteneſs, or Power, places them beyond the Reach of the Law. For, by the Return of <hi>non invent.</hi> generally made upon Writs, one would be apt to imagine, that no ſingle Sub-Sheriff knew of any ſuch Thing, as a Man of Fortune, within his reſpective County, throughout the Kingdom of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I was laſt at <hi>Paris,</hi> I had the Honour to be introduced to Meſſieurs <hi>Thimble</hi> and <hi>Gooſe,</hi> two Taylors of Quality. In the Courſe of Converſation, it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to turn, as uſual, on the Dulneſs of the Times, the Deadneſs of Trade, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of Payment. Says Monſieur <hi>Thimble,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0237300103:253"/>I had the Misfortune to make Intereſt for the new Cloathing of the laſt Regiments that were tranſported to <hi>Canada.</hi> But In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt was, again, to be made for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, before that could be done, the Officers were ſhipped off, with greater Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of my Gold and Silver on their Backs, than, I am ſure, they carried of their own in their Pockets. Ambition, cried Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>le Gooſe,</hi> Ambition has brought me to the very Brink of Ruin: I ſcorned to work for any thing under the Degree of Nobility, and be pox'd to me! and the Nobility are a Sort of People, whom we can never ſet our Eyes on, except at the Time we are fitting on their Clothes.</p>
               <p>Before Money became the Medium of Commerce, the ſimple Buſineſs of the World was carried on by Truck, or the Commutation of one Commodity for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But, when Men conſented to fix certain rateable Values upon Money, as a ready and portable Equivalent for all Sorts of Effects, Credit was conſequently intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by the Engagements of ſome, to pay ſo much Money in lieu of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, or to deliver ſuch or ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities on the Advance of ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and States found it their Intereſt to ſupport ſuch public Credit, by enforcing the Performance of ſaid Engagements.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0237300103:254"/>
By the Common-Law of <hi>England,</hi> no Perſon, except the King, could take the Body of another in Execution for Debt; neither was this Prerogative of the Crown extended to the Subject till the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge,</hi> ch. 23. in the Reign of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> III.</p>
               <p>Many contract Debts, through Vanity, or Intemperance; or borrow Money, or take up Goods, with the Intention of Thieves and Robbers, never to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. When ſuch ſuffer, they ſuffer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, in Expiation of their Guilt. But there are unavoidable Damages by Water, by Fire, the Cruſh of Power, oppreſſive Landlords, and more oppreſſive Lawſuits, Death of Cattle, Failure of Crop, Failure of Payment in others; with thouſands of ſuch like Caſualties, whereby Men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bankrupt, and yet continue blameleſs. And, in all ſuch Caſes, one would think that the preſent Ruin was ſufficient Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, without the Exertion of Law to make that Ruin irreparable.</p>
               <p>As all the Members of a Community are intereſted in the Life, Liberty, and Labours of each other; He, who puts the Rigour of our Laws in Execution, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an inſolvent Brother in Gaol, is guilty of a fourfold Injury; firſt, he robs
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0237300103:255"/>the Community of the Labours of their Brother; ſecondly, he robs his Brother of all Means of retrieving his ſhatter'd For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; thirdly, he deprives himſelf of the Poſſibility of Payment; and, laſtly, he lays an unneceſſary Burden on the Public, who, in Charity, muſt maintain the Member whom he, in his Cruelty, confines.</p>
               <p>However, ſince the Severity of Law is ſuch, that He, whoſe Misfortunes have render'd him inſolvent, muſt make <hi>Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, (for ſo the Savages eſteem it)</hi> by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering his Body to Durance for Life; it is ſurely incumbent on our Legiſlators and Governors to make the Condition of the unhappy Sufferers as little grievous as may be.</p>
               <p>But this moſt Chriſtian Duty, this moſt humane of all Cares, is yet to come. When a Debtor is delivered up into the Phangs of his Gaoler, he is conſigned to abſolute and arbitrary Slavery; and Woe be to the Wretch whoſe Poverty may not have left him a <hi>Sop</hi> for <hi>Cerberus.</hi> How more than miſerable muſt be the State of thoſe unhappy Men who are ſhut in from all poſſible Redreſs or Appeal againſt the deſpotic Treatment of their ſavage Keepers, whoſe Hearts are habitually hardened to all Senſe of Remorſe, and whoſe Ears are render'd callous by inceſſant Groans.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0237300103:256"/>
We are credibly informed, that it is uſual, with ſuch Keepers, to amaſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Fortunes from the Wrecks of the Wretched; to ſqueeze them by exorbitant Charges and illicit Demands, as Grapes are ſqueezed in a Vine Preſs, while one Drop remains; and then to huddle them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into naked Walls and windowleſs Rooms; having got all they can, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further to regard, ſave the Return of their lifeleſs Bodies to their Creditors.</p>
               <p>How many of theſe Keepers exact, from their diſtreſſed Priſoners, ſeven and eight Shillings per Week, for Rooms that would not rent, at a Third of that Sum, in any other Part of this City. At times, Nine of thoſe wretched Priſoners are driven to kennel together in a Hovel fit only to ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Pair of Horſes, while many unoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied Apartments are locked up from uſe. Even a Sufficiency of the common Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Water is refuſed to their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, an Advantage which the Felons in Newgate enjoy. Public and private Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions are diſſipated or diſpoſed of, at the Pleaſure of the Keepers, regardleſs of the Intention or Order of the Donors. And the Apartments, appointed to theſe miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men, are generally damp or ſhattered in the Flooring, and expoſed, by Breach
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0237300103:257"/>or Want of Windows, to the Inclemency of Night Air, and all the Rigour of the Seaſons.</p>
               <p>But what avail their Complaints, if the Legiſlature have not authorized, or made it the Duty of ſome eſpecial Magiſtrates to examine into and redreſs theſe crying Abuſes?</p>
               <p>But, tell me, continued Mr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> were there any Priſoners of Conſideration among the confined Debtors? A few, Sir, of Note, and many who had been well to paſs in the World. Among theſe, indeed, it was, that every Scene and Species of Miſery was diſplayed. There you might ſee, as you have ſaid, numerous Families of Wretches, whoſe thin and tatter'd Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but ill defended their ſhivering Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from the Inclemency of Elements, that blew through ſhattered Windows, or came pouring from unſtaunched Roofs.</p>
               <p>Theſe People fared incomparably worſe than thoſe of the vulgar Herd; for, being aſhamed to beg at the Grates, they had nothing to ſubſiſt on, ſave their ſcanty Portion of ſuch Charities as happen'd to be ſent in, from Time to Time, and this ſcarcely ſupplied them with a ſufficiency of Water, black Bread, and Offal; while the Recollection of their former Affluence add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0237300103:258"/>ſharp and bitter Poignancy to the Senſe of their preſent Wants.—But, here comes my Pupil, he will be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, on Scenes with which his Heart was ſo meltingly affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harry</hi> then entered, with Mrs. <hi>Clement</hi> careſſing him on the one Side, and his old Dependant <hi>Ned</hi> hanging about him on the other.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Clement</hi> and his <hi>Arabella</hi> had embraced, and that all were ſettled and ſeated. Well, <hi>Harry,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> will you favour us with ſome Account of your Expedition? Have you e'er a pretty Story for me, my <hi>Harry?</hi> Several Stories, Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> that were ſweet pretty Stories, when I heard them; but, Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> had better tell them; they would be ſadly bungled if they came through my Hands, Dada. The Company will make Allowances, replied Mr. <hi>Fenton;</hi> let us have theſe Stories in your own Way, <hi>Harry,</hi> juſt as your Memory may happen to ſerve you.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond Day, Dada, as my Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and I were walking in the Court Yard of the Fleet Priſon, who ſhould I ſpy but my old Maſter, Mr. <hi>Vindex,</hi> walking, very ſad, to and again by the Wall. He was ſo pale and ſhabby, and ſo fallen away,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0237300103:259"/>that I did not rightly know him, till I looked at him very earneſtly. My Heart then began to ſoften and warm toward the poor Man; for it told me, that ſomething very ſorrowful muſt have happened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could have been brought to that Condition. So, I went up to him, with a Face, I believe, as melancholy as his own.</p>
               <p>How do you do, good Mr. <hi>Vindex?</hi> ſaid I. I ſhould be glad to ſee you, if I did not ſee you look ſo ſad. He then ſtared at me for ſome Time, and, at length, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring me, he looked concerned, and turned away to ſhun me; but I took him lovingly by the Hand, and ſaid, you muſt not leave me, Mr. <hi>Vindex;</hi> won't you know your old Scholar, <hi>Harry Fenton?</hi> Yes, ſays he, caſting down his mournful Eyes, I know you now, Maſter; I know I uſed you baſely, and I know why you are come; but, reproach me, and inſult me, as much as you pleaſe, all is welcome now, ſince I cannot lie lower, till I am laid in the Earth.</p>
               <p>I do not mean to inſult you, this Tear will witneſs for me, that I do not mean to inſult you, my dear Mr. <hi>Vindex,</hi> and ſo I wiped my Eye. Here are twenty Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, to put warm Clothes upon you in this cold Weather. Little and low as I am myſelf, I will try to do ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0237300103:260"/>for you, and ſo give me one Kiſs in Token that we are Friends.</p>
               <p>The poor dear Man then opened his broad Eyes, in a wild Stare upon me, with a Look that was made up, Half of Joy, and Half of Shame. He then kneeled down, as I ſuppoſed, that I might reach to kiſs him, and taking me into his Arms, you are not born of Woman, you are an Angel, an Angel, he cried; and ſo he fell a crying, and cry'd ſo ſadly, that I could not, for my Heart, but keep him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>I did all I could to pacify and make him chearful, and getting him up at laſt, you muſt not part with me Mr. <hi>Vindex,</hi> ſaid I, we muſt dine and ſpend the Day together. Here is Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> my Tutor, you and he too muſt be Friends.</p>
               <p>I then led him, by the Hand, into a large ground Room that Mr. <hi>Cloſe,</hi> the chief Keeper, had appointed for us; and I ordered Dinner to be haſtened and brought up. As ſoon as we were all ſeated, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to laugh and joke, after my fooliſh Way, in order to make poor Mr. <hi>Vindex</hi> merry. When I found that it would not do, Mr. <hi>Vindex,</hi> ſaid I, be ſo kind to let me know what the Money may come to for which you are confined? A terrible
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0237300103:261"/>Sum, indeed, my Darling, ſaid he, no leſs than a hundred and fifty two Pounds. I then put my Hand in my Pocket, and, taking out two Bills and a little Matter of Money that made up the Sum, I put it into his Hand, ſaying, my Friend ſhall never lie in Gaol for ſuch a Trifle as this.</p>
               <p>Having looked for ſome Time at the Bills, with Amazement, he turned to my Tutor with a doubtful and ſhamed Face; is this young Gentleman, Sir, ſaid he, duely authorized to diſpoſe of ſuch vaſt Matters as theſe? He is, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> he is the Carver and Diſpoſer of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Fortune at Pleaſure; and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that his Father will think himſelf doubly paid in the Uſe that his noble Son has made of his Privilege this Day.</p>
               <p>A Gleam then, like that of Sunſhine, broke through his ſad Countenance, as through the Clouds of a dark Day; and, are you the one, he cried, are you the one, Maſter <hi>Harry,</hi> whom I treated ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly? You may forgive me, my little Cherubim, you, indeed, may forgive me, but, I never, I never ſhall forgive myſelf. O, Mr. <hi>Vindex,</hi> ſaid I, I would very nearly undergo the ſame Whipping again, to do you twice the Kindneſs, and make you love me twice as much as you now love me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0237300103:262"/>
Dinner was now ſerved, and, calling for Wine, I filled him a Bumper, in a large Glaſs, which he drank to the Health of my glorious Dada, as he called you, Sir. Upon this, we grew very merry and friendly among one another, and, when Dinner was over, I begged him to tell me how he came to be put into Confinement.</p>
               <p>O, Maſter <hi>Harry,</hi> he cried, I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd all that I have ſuffer'd, very juſtly, very juſtly for my harſh and cruel Uſage of you, Maſter <hi>Harry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Affair of the Hobgoblins, as you know, the Shame to which I was put by my Fright and by my Scourging, began to be whiſper'd, and then to be noiſed about the Town. The Boys, at length, catched the Rumour, and began to hoot at me; and the more I chaſtiſed them, the more they gathered about me, and ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after me, a Rod for the Flogger, a Rod for the Flogger!</p>
               <p>No Diſeaſe is ſo deadly, no Blaſting ſo baneful, as Contempt to a Man, in the Way of his Profeſſion. My Boys grew diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and behaved themſelves, in School, without Reſpect to my Perſon, or Regard to my Government. Even my Intimates
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0237300103:263"/>ſhunned me, and would caſt at me a ſide Glance of ſmiling Scorn as they paſſed. My School then melted from me like Snow in a Fog. Even my Boarders for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook me. I ſtood at a high Rent; my Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects were ſeized by the Landlord. It was in vain that I ſollicited Payment from the Parents of my Scholars. No one who was indebted to me, would give me a Penny; while all that I owed came like a tumbling Houſe upon me; and ſo I was caſt into this Priſon, from whence your Bounty has ſet me free.</p>
               <p>My poor broken hearted Wife would have accompanied me to Gaol; but, as I had not wherewithal to give her a Morſel of Bread, I ſent her to an old Aunt who had the Humanity to take her in.</p>
               <p>Alas, alas, poor Mr. <hi>Vindex,</hi> ſaid I, had I gueſſed any Part of the Miſchiefs that our unlucky Pranks have brought upon you, I would have put both my Hands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Furnace of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> rather than have Act or Part in ſuch a Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For, herein we acted the Fable of the Frogs and the Boys, that which was <hi>Play</hi> to us, was <hi>Death</hi> to you, Mr. <hi>Vindex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Conſcience, now, we are indebted to you for every Misfortune we cauſed you;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0237300103:264"/>and, as you are not yet paid for the Half of your Sufferings, I here give you my Hand and Word to make up a hundred and fifty Pounds more for you; and, for this, I will not accept the ſmalleſt Thanks, as I think it is no more than an Act of common Honeſty. And I, cried Mr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> I hold myſelf indebted to you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, my noble <hi>Harry,</hi> for that ſingle Sentiment. That's well, that's well, Dada, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> (leaping up and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his Hands) I ſhall now be clear in the World with all my poor Creditors.</p>
               <p>Thus, Dada, continued he, it rejoiced my Heart, greatly, to ſend poor Mr. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> away, in ſuch Triumph; while my Tutor and I went two or three Doors off, to ſee a mighty pretty young Creature who was ſaid to be confined with her ancient Father. And I will tell you their Story, with two or three other Stories, more on account of the Incidents that happened while we were there, than of any Thing elſe that was wonderful or uncommon in them.</p>
               <p>On tapping at the Door, we were deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to walk in, and ſaw a Female, with her Back to us, waving Bone Lace on a Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; while an elderly Man, with Spectacles on, read to her in <hi>Thomas a Kempis.</hi> They both roſe to ſalute us. Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> then
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0237300103:265"/>ſtepped up, and, ſeeing what they were about, cried, God cannot but proſper your Work, good People, ſince you employ your Time to his Purpoſes, both on Earth and in Heaven. As an Earneſt of his Kindneſs to you, he ſends you, by us, a conſiderable Charity, which you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as ſoon as you inform us who, and what you are, and how you came here? Bleſſed be the Meſſengers of my God, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the Father, whether they come with happy or with heavy Tidings, I ſay with old <hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Dada, I was quite charmed, when the Daughter turned to me. There was ſuch a Sweetneſs, ſuch a heavenly Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs in her Face, that I could have kiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and kiſſed her, again and again.</p>
               <p>As I had brought a Glaſs and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of our Bottle with me, we all got about a Board that was Half Stool and Half Table, and, after a Round or two, the good Man began his Story.</p>
               <p>My Father's Name was <hi>Samuel Stern.</hi> He had a clear Eſtate of nine hundred and fifty Pounds a Year in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and had, by my Mother, three Daughters and four Sons, of whom I was the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0237300103:266"/>
My Father, unhappily, was a Loyaliſt, and when the Troubles broke out between King <hi>Charles</hi> and the Parliament, he took up all the Money he could, at any Intereſt, and raiſed a Company, at his own Coſt, which he headed on the Part of his Royal Maſter.</p>
               <p>After ſome ſucceſsful Skirmiſhes, his Head was ſplit in two by the Broad-ſword of a Trooper, at the Battle of <hi>Naiſby.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, all our Servants forſook us, each carrying away with them whatever came to Hand; and, quickly after, the Soldiers of the Commonwealth came, carried off all the Cattle, and left nothing of our Houſe, except the bare Walls.</p>
               <p>In the mean time we, poor Children, huddled together into the Garden, and, there ſeparating, ran and crept under Buſhes and Hedges, as ſo many Chickens endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to gain Shelter from the Kite.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Noiſe of the Tumult was over, we roſe and looked about fearfully, and, getting together again, we helped one another through the Garden Hedge, and made, as faſt as we could, to the Cottage of a neighbouring Farmer who had been our Father's Tenant. Here we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived coldly, and fared but very hardly for
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0237300103:267"/>that Night. On the next Day however, in order to get quit of us, as I ſuppoſe, the Man went among our Relations, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on one to take a Son, and on another to take a Daughter, till we were all divided among them; and ſo we enter'd on a kind of Service to our Kindred, a Service, as I believe, that is found, on Experience, to be much harder and more inſulting than any Service to a Stranger.</p>
               <p>I forgot to tell you, Gentlemen, that our Mother deceaſed before our Father en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Arms, inſomuch that we became Orphans in all Reſpects. I fell to the Share of an Uncle by my Mother's Side. He had a ſmall Eſtate of about a hundred and twenty Pounds yearly Income, with one Son, and a Daughter whom I thought very lovely.</p>
               <p>My Uncle appointed me Overſeer of his Labourers, as alſo his occaſional Clerk, for caſting Accounts, and inditing his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but, when it was intimated to him that there was a ſecret Liking between his Daughter and me, he called me aſide, and, taking up a Book of profane Poems, he kiſſed it and ſwore, by the Contents thereof, that, if ever I married his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he would not give us a Groat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0237300103:268"/>
If you ever knew what Love was, ſaid he to Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> you muſt know that it breaks over ſtronger Fences than theſe. In ſhort, we were wedded and turned out of the Houſe, without any thing to live upon, except about the Value of twenty Pounds, in ſmall Matters, which had been given to my Wife, from Time to Time, by lady <hi>Goodly,</hi> her God-mother.</p>
               <p>We made the beſt of our Way to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> My Wife underſtood Needlework, and, as I knew that my Father-in-law was quite irreconcileable, I joined myſelf to a Houſe Painter, to whom I gave my Time for nothing, on Condition of his giving me a Sight into his Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>In the third Year, my dear Wife brought this poor Creature into the World; but, happily, ſhe did not encumber Mankind with any more of our wretched and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Progeny.</p>
               <p>All our Care and Delight was fixed on this our little Daughter, and we thought nothing of any Pains or Labours that might ſerve to introduce her, like herſelf, into the World.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Charles</hi> the IId. had aſcended the Throne, our Relations were fully aſſured
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0237300103:269"/>that we ſhould be reſtored to our ancient Rights and Poſſeſſions; and they contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it were for their own Credit, to ſet us forth in a ſuitable Manner for appearing at Court. There accordingly we attended, from time to time, for the Space of twelve Months, and got a Number of woful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials preſented to his Majeſty; but his Majeſty was ſo deeply engaged in his Pleaſures, or ſo fearful of offending the Enemies of his Houſe, that he gave no Attention to our Wrongs. There may alſo be ſomething in the Breaſts of the Great that excites them to Acts of Bounty, rather than Acts of Juſtice; for theſe, as they apprehend, might be accepted as Matter of Debt and not as Matter of Favour.</p>
               <p>Being tired of a fruitleſs Suit, I returned to my former Employment, and, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Frugality, I lived with my little Family quite happy and contented.</p>
               <p>About ten Months ago, two Men came to our Lodgings. The one was in a rich Livery, and, having enquired for my Daughter, preſented her with a Note to this effect,—<q>Lady <hi>Diana Templar</hi> ſends <hi>Diana Stern</hi> the encloſed Bill of twenty five Pounds, in order to put her into ſome little Way of Livelihood.</q>—As my poor dear Child had no Cauſe to ſuſpect
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0237300103:270"/>any Fraud or evil Intention in the Caſe, ſhe deſired the Men to return her moſt humble Thanks and Duty to her Ladyſhip, and away they went.</p>
               <p>As this Lady was a diſtant Relation of my Wife's Father, my Daughter, in a few Days, dreſſed herſelf in her beſt, and went to return Thanks to her Ladyſhip in Perſon, but was told that ſhe was gone to her Seat in the Country.</p>
               <p>In the mean time ſhe laid out her ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Bounty in furniſhing a little front Shop with ſome millinary Wares, and was already beginning to get ſome Cuſtom, when, one Evening, two Bailiffs enter'd laid an Action upon her, and, taking her up in their Arms, hurried her into a Coach that drove up to the Door.</p>
               <p>My Wife and I had ruſhed out, on hearing our Child ſhriek, and ſeeing a Coach ſet off with her at a great Rate, we ran after as faſt as we could, ſhouting and ſcreaming, and crying, ſtop the Coach, ſtop the Coach, a Rape, a Rape! At length a bold Fellow, who was paſſing, caught one of the Horſes by the Bridle, and, while the Coachman laſhed at him, he took out his Knife and cut the Reins in two. A Mob then began to gather, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a well dreſs'd Man, who was in the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0237300103:271"/>Coach, leaped out and made his Eſcape; but the Coachman was not ſo lucky, the People pulled him from the Box, and having beaten and kicked him, they dragged him through the Kennel.</p>
               <p>Mean while we got our Child out, and then the Mob overturned the Coach, and, jumping upon it, broke and daſhed it all to Pieces. We then thought that we had nothing further to apprehend, and, taking our Child between us, we turned back and walked homeward; but alas, we were not permitted to enter; the two Bailiffs met us, and, producing their Writ, again arreſted our Daughter at the Suit, as they ſaid, of <hi>Jonathan Delvil,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for the Sum of twenty five Pounds which he had lent her on ſuch a Day. So they conducted her here, while my Wife and I accompanied her, weeping and ſobbing all the Way.</p>
               <p>I then took theſe poor Apartments to cover us from the Weather, and as my Wife grew ſuddenly ſick and faint, I haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened back to our Lodgings, and had our Bedding brought hither.</p>
               <p>It was now evident that the pretended Gift of Lady <hi>Templar</hi> was no other than a diabolical Scheme of the Villain <hi>Delvil,</hi> to get the Perſon of my Darling within his Fangs; and I curſed my own Stupidity for
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0237300103:272"/>not perceiving it at firſt; but bleſſed be my God however, in all Events, that my Lamb was ſtill innocent, was ſtill unſullied.</p>
               <p>What with Grief and the Fright toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my dear Wife took to her Bed, from whence ſhe never roſe, but expired on the fifth Day, bleſſing and preſſing her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her Boſom. My poor Infant then fell as dead beſide her Mother, and could not be recovered from her Fit in many Hours; and, indeed, it was then the Wiſh and the Prayer of my Soul, that we might all be laid and forgotten in one Grave toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as my Darling was recovered however, I again wiſhed to live for her ſake, that I might not leave her without a Comforter or Protector, in the midſt of a mercileſs and wicked World.</p>
               <p>In order to pay the Nurſekeeper, the Doctor, and Apothecary, as alſo to defray the funeral Expences, I left my Child with the Nurſekeeper, and, going to our former Lodgings, I ſold all her millinary Matters at ſomething under a third of prime Coſt; and having diſcharged the Lodgings and pay'd my Gaol Debts, I prepared to lay my precious Depoſit in the Womb of that Earth which is one Day to render her back, incorruptible to Eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0237300103:273"/>
When the Corps was carrying out at the Door, my Child fell once more into Fits, and I was divided and quite diſtracted about what I ſhould do, whether to ſtay with the Living, or pay my Duty to the Dead. But I will no longer detain you with melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Matters, ſince all worldly Griefs, with all worldly Joys alſo, muſt ſhortly be done away.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I underſtood that Lady <hi>Templar</hi> was returnned to Town, I waited upon her, and giving her an Abridgment of our manifold Misfortunes, I produced the Note that had been written in her Name; but ſhe coldly replied, that it was not her Hand, and that ſhe was not anſwerable for the Frauds or Villanies of others.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, my dear Girl accuſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the Cauſe of all our Calamities, and pined away, on that Account, as pale as the Sheets ſhe lay in. She was alſo ſo enfeeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by her faintiſh and ſick Fits, that ſhe was not able to make a third of her uſual Earnings; and as I, on my Part, was alſo diſqualified from labouring in my Profeſſion, ſince I did not dare to leave my Child alone and unſheltered, we were reduced to a State of the greateſt Extremity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0237300103:274"/>
One Day, Word was brought me that a Gentleman, a few Doors off, deſired to ſpeak with me; and as they, who are ſinking, catch at any thing for their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, my Heart flutter'd in the Hope of ſome happy Reverſe. Accordingly I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Meſſenger. His Appearance, in Dreſs and Perſon, was altogether that of the Gentleman.</p>
               <p>He ordered all others out of the Room, and requeſting me to ſit beſide him, in a half whiſpering Voice he began: I am come, Mr. <hi>Stern,</hi> from one whom you have great Reaſon to account your greateſt Enemy, I come from Mr. <hi>Delvil,</hi> at whoſe Suit your Daughter now lies in Priſon. I ſtarted—Be patient, Sir, he ſaid. He knows your Diſtreſſes, he knows all your Wants, he knows alſo that he is the Author of them; yet I tell you that he feels them, as if they were his own, and that it was not his Enmity, but his Love that occaſioned them.</p>
               <p>He depends on his old Uncle <hi>Dimmock</hi> for a vaſt Fortune in Expectation. He ſaw your Daughter and loved her; he ſaw her again and loved her to Madneſs. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired her Family, her Character, and found that he had nothing to expect from any licentious Propoſal. He feared, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0237300103:275"/>that all muſt love her, as he did, and, to prevent other Pirates, he made uſe of the Stratagem which, contrary to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, has brought you here. He never meant any thing diſhonourable by your Daughter. Had he carried her clear off, you might all have been happy together at this Day; and, if you conſent, he will marry her here, in the Preſence of a few Witneſſes, who ſhall be ſworn to Secrecy till his Uncle's Death; and he will inſtantly pay you down three hundred Pounds, in Recompence for your Sufferings, and will ſettle one hundred Pounds Annuity on your Child for Life.</p>
               <p>I muſt own that, to one in my Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, this Propoſal had ſomething very tempting in it. But who is this Mr. <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> ſaid I, I know him not, I never ſaw him? — I am the Man, Sir, ſaid he. I would have diſcharged my Action as I came to this Place; but I dare not permit your Daughter to get out of my Cuſtody; for, at the Loſs of my Fortune, at the Loſs of my Life, I am determined that no other Man living ſhall poſſeſs her. I then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him that I would make a faithful Narration to my Child of all that had paſſed, but told him, at the ſame time, that I would wholly ſubſcribe to her Pleaſure; and ſo we parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0237300103:276"/>
As ſoon as I repreſented this Matter to my <hi>Diana,</hi> O no, my Papa, ſhe cried, it is impoſſible, it never can be, I would do any thing, ſuffer any thing, but this, for your Relief. Would you act the Marriage of the Lamb and the Wolf in the Fable? If ſuch have been the Conſequences of this Gentleman's Affection for us, what have we not to expect from the Effects of his Averſion? I would prefer any Kind of Death to a Life with ſuch a Man. And then, my Mother, ſhe cried, and burſt into Tears) my dear Mother whom he has murdered! tho' he were worth Half the World, and would marry me publickly in the Face of the other Half; it will not be, it cannot be, indeed, my Papa!</p>
               <p>Hereupon I writ Mr. <hi>Delvil</hi> almoſt a literal Account of my Daughter's Anſwer. It is nearly five Weeks ſince this happened, and we have not hear'd any thing further from him.</p>
               <p>In this time, however, we got acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Family at the next Door, whoſe Converſe has been a great Conſolation to us. There is a Father and Mother with ſeven ſmall Children, Boys and Girls; they are very worthy People, and of noble Deſcent, but how they contrive to live at all I can't conceive, for they have no
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0237300103:277"/>viſible Means of making a Penny. Had we not known them, we ſhould have thought ourſelves the pooreſt of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We muſt own them more deſerving of your Charity than we are.</p>
               <p>Here poor Mr. <hi>Stern</hi> ended; and you can't think, Dada, how my Heart leapt with Love toward him, on his recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others as more deſerving than himſelf. So I reſolved, at once, what to do, and taking two 50<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> Notes from my Pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, you ſhall not be under the Neceſſity, Mr. <hi>Stern,</hi> ſays I, of marrying your pretty Lamb here to the ugly Wolf, ſo here is fifty Pounds to pay your Action, and Fees, and other ſmall Debts.</p>
               <p>On taking the Note, Dada, he looked at it very earneſtly, and when he ſaw it was a true Note, he opened his Eyes and his Mouth ſo wide, and ſtood ſo ſtiff, without ſtirring Hand or Foot, that he put me in mind of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife who was turned into a Pillar of Salt. However, I did not ſeem to mind him, but turning to his Daughter, and ſhewing her the other Note, Miſs <hi>Diana,</hi> ſays I, here is fifty Pounds for you alſo, in order to ſet you up in your little Shop again, but you ſhall not have it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a certain Condition; what Condition, Maſter, ſaid ſhe ſmiling; the Condition,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0237300103:278"/>ſays I, of putting your Arms about my Neck, and giving me one or two ſweet Kiſſes. She then looked earneſtly at me, with Eyes ſwimming in Pleaſure, and ſtarting ſuddenly to me, and catching me to her Boſom, ſhe kiſſed my Lips, and my Forehead, and my Head, again and again, and then ſet up as lamentable and loud a Cry, as if her Father had lain a Corpſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Stern,</hi> then, lifted up his Eyes, and dropping on his Knees, O my God, he cried, how bountiful art thou to a Wretch who is not worthy the leaſt of all thy Mercies! hereupon, the Daughter turned, and, ſeeing the Poſture of her Father, ſhe fell on her Knees before him, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Arms about him, he folded her in his alſo, and they wept plentifully upon each other.</p>
               <p>How comes it, Dada, that Crying ſhould be ſo catching? However it be, Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> and I could not contain, and I ſhall love him the better during Life, for the Tears that he ſhed on that Occaſion.</p>
               <p>On hearing a ſmart Rapping, Mr. <hi>Stern</hi> roſe and opened the Door, where a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, almoſt breathleſs, delivered him a Letter. The Letter was to the Purpoſe that Mr. <hi>Delvil</hi> was ill of a Quinſy, that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0237300103:279"/>he had but a few Hours to live, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted Mr. <hi>Stern</hi> to bring his Daughter to him, that, by Marriage, he might give her a lawful Title to his Fortune. No, Papa, cried <hi>Diana,</hi> living or dead, nothing ſhall ever bribe me to give my Hand to a Man who has had a Hand in the Death of my deareſt Mother.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> however, thought it adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that Mr. <hi>Stern</hi> ſhould attend the Meſſenger, to ſee if Mr. <hi>Delvil</hi> was really ill, or whether this might not be ſome new contrived Treachery.</p>
               <p>This was a Day of Succeſſes to poor Mr. <hi>Stern.</hi> We had promiſed to ſtay with his <hi>Diana</hi> till his Return; and he had not been long gone till ſome one tapped at the Door. I opened it, and ſaw an exceeding old and reverend Man; he was dreſſed all in black, and his white Head looked like Snow on the Feathers of the Raven. Is <hi>Tom Stern</hi> here? ſaid he. No, Sir, ſaid I, he is gone into Town. I thought he was a Priſoner; no, Sir, it is not he, but his Daughter, who is under Confinement. Will you give a feeble old Man leave to ſit with you, Gentlemen? and ſo down he ſat. Come here to me, Child, ſays he to <hi>Diana,</hi> are you a Daughter of <hi>Tom Stern?</hi> I am, Sir, ſo pleaſe you. And what was your Mother's Name? <hi>Anne Roche,</hi> Sir;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0237300103:280"/>but, alas! ſhe is not living, I was the Cauſe of her Death; ſhe broke her Heart, good Sir, on my being put to Gaol. I hope, Child, ſaid the old Gentleman, that you were not impriſoned for any thing that was naughty. No, Sir, no, cried Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> it was her Honeſty alone that brought and kept her here; had ſhe been leſs virtuous, ſhe might have been at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and flaunting about in her Coach.</p>
               <p>The old Man then put on his Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and ordering her to draw nearer, he took a Hand in each of his, and looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently in her Face, what is your Name, my Dear? ſaid he; <hi>Diana,</hi> honoured Sir. That is a pretty and chaſte Name, for an unchriſtian Name. Indeed, <hi>Diana,</hi> you are a ſweet Babe, and the prettieſt little Priſoner that ever I ſaw. I will pay all your Debts, and give you a thouſand Pounds over, if you will come along with me, and be my Priſoner, <hi>Diana.</hi> Ah, Sir, cried the Girl, it is too much to have broken the Heart of one Parent already; I would not leave my dear Father for any Man with all the Money in all the World. You do not leave your Father, he cried, by going with me, <hi>Diana.</hi> I am your true Father, the Father of <hi>Nanny Roche,</hi> the Father of her who bore you, your own Grandfather, my <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0237300103:281"/>
Here ſhe ſunk on her Knees, between his Knees, begging and beſeeching his Bleſſing; while his Hands and Eyes were lifted in Prayer over her. He then raiſed her, and placing her gently on his Knee, claſped her in his aged Arms; while ſhe threw hers about his Neck, and joining her Cheek to his, ſobbed aloud and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Tears into his Boſom. The old Gentleman, however, did not expreſs his Concern by Word, or Sob, or even any Change of his Countenance, and yet his Tears fell faſt, down his reverend and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted Features, upon his Grandchild.</p>
               <p>This, Dada, was a very pleaſing, though a very affecting Sight. As ſoon as the Height of their Paſſion was ſomething abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Miſs <hi>Diana</hi> turned her Eye toward me, and ſaid, You were pleaſed, my Grand-Papa, to promiſe that you would pay my Debts; but that is done already. This Angel here was ſent to prevent all others, and he further preſented me with this Bill of 50<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to ſet me up in a better Shop than I kept before.</p>
               <p>I rejoice, cried the old Man, I rejoice to find that ſo much of Heaven is ſtill left upon Earth. But you, my <hi>Diana,</hi> are now in a Condition, rather to give Charity than receive it from any. Your dear
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0237300103:282"/>Uncle <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who traded to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> lately died of the Smallpox on his Paſſage homeward. You are the Heir of his Fortunes, and the Heir of my Fortune; you are the whole and ſole Lady of all our Poſſeſſions. But, tell me, how much did this young Gentleman advance in your Favour? A hundred Pounds, Sir.</p>
               <p>He then took out a Bank Note of a hundred Pounds, and having offered it to me, I did not dare to refuſe it, for fear of offending the Honour of the reſpectable old Gentleman; ſo I held it in my Hand after a doubting Manner. My dear Miſs <hi>Diana,</hi> ſays I, I will not be put to the Pain of taking this back again, but on the Condition of your telling me to whom I ſhall give it? O, ſhe cried out inſtantly, to the Babies, to the ſweet Babies at the next Door; I wiſh to Heaven I had as much more to add to it for their Sakes.</p>
               <p>I then enquired the Name of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Family at the next Door, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told that it was <hi>Ruth,</hi> I looked over my Liſt, and found that Mr. <hi>Ruth</hi> was in for above ſeven hundred Pounds. This grieved me very much, as ſuch a Sum nearly amounted to the Half of our whole Stock. However, I comforted myſelf with the Hope that God would ſend ſome
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0237300103:283"/>one elſe, to make up to this poor Family what ſhould be wanting on my Part.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Stern</hi> juſt then returned. I beg Pardon, ſaid he, Gentlemen, for detaining you ſo long, but I could not avoid it. The unhappy Man is actually dying, a very terrible Death, indeed, in his full Strength, and almoſt in his full Health, ſtifling and gaſping for Air, which the ſwelling of his Glands will not ſuffer to paſs.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I enter'd, he beckoned to me, and put this Paper, ſealed, into my Hand. And again, obſerving that I was agitated and deeply concerned for the State under which he laboured, he reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his Hand to me, and, graſping my right Hand, put this Ring upon my Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.—This Paper contains, under his Hand and Seal, a Diſcharge of the Action which he laid upon my Daughter, as alſo a Conveyance to us, of the Caſh Notes encloſed, amounting to three hundred Pounds, in Conſideration, as he recites, of our Loſſes and unjuſt Sufferings. And ſo, my dear Maſter <hi>Fenton,</hi> I here return you your 100<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> with all poſſible Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and a Senſe of the Obligation that will never leave me, during Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0237300103:284"/>
Sir, ſaid I, you muſt excuſe me, I am already payed. That Gentleman, yonder, compell'd me to accept of the very Sum you offer.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Stern</hi> then ſtarted, and, turning, he ſaw his Uncle; and, eying him inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, at length recollected who he was. He then ſtepped up and, falling on his Knees before him, O, Sir, he cried, your Pardon, your Pardon! 'Tis all I preſume to aſk, I dare not hope for your Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tom,</hi> ſaid the old Gentleman, I wanted to be even with you, I wanted to ſeduce your Daughter, as you ſeduced mine. But your Daughter, <hi>Tom,</hi> though come of very rebellious Parents, would not be ſeduced. Howſomever, as I have taken a liking to her, ſhe muſt come along with me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe will or no. And, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joſeph</hi> concerning <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> ſhe ſhall be mine and not thine, <hi>Tom;</hi> and my Name and the Name of my Fathers ſhall be named upon her, according to her Inheritance. But, if you have any Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this my Child, <hi>Tom,</hi> and are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with her, you may follow her, and welcome.</p>
               <p>Soon after, we got up, and, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated this happy Family on the Bleſſing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0237300103:285"/>of their Meeting and Reconciliation, I ſtepped to the old Gentleman, and, catching him about the Neck, tenderly took my Leave of him, as I did alſo of Mr. <hi>Stern.</hi> But, when I went to take leave of the fair <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhe drew ſome Steps backward, and, her Eyes and ſweet Features beginning to ſwell, ſhe again run forward, and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in her dear Arms, O, my Darling, my Darling, my Darling, ſhe cried, am I then going to loſe you, it may be never to ſee you more! were it but once in a Week, in a Month, in a Year to behold you, even that would keep me alive for all the Remainder. O my beſt, my moſt generous, my firſt Preſerver, it is you who might be the Seducer, who might make me and others to run after you bare-foot. But if we muſt part, my little Angel, do but promiſe to know me in Heaven, and there your poor <hi>Diana</hi> will meet you, never to part any more.</p>
               <p>What could I ſay or do, Dada, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the dear Girl? my Heart ſwelled, almoſt to burſting, while ſhe careſſed and wept over me. At length, with Words, as well as my Tears would give me leave to pronounce them, I demanded the Name of the Place to which ſhe was going, and promiſed to pay her a Viſit as ſoon as poſſibly I could. We then parted very melancholy, notwithſtanding all our Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0237300103:286"/>and, going out, I wiped my Eyes, and begged Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> to order Tea and Coffee, with a comfortable Entertainment for the Family, at the next Door, while I ſhould go in and introduce myſelf as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Having tapped gently at the Door, it was opened by a little ragged Boy of about five Years old. Mrs. <hi>Ruth</hi> ſat full in my view, and her three little Daughters ſtood before her, while ſhe examined them in the Old Teſtament Queſtions of who was the firſt Man, and the wiſeſt Man, and the ſtrongeſt Man, and the oldeſt Man, and above all, the Man after God's own Heart?</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Ruth</hi> was a fine Woman, and had a great deal of humbled Dignity about her. I bowed to her as I enter'd, and, going familiarly up, I took her by the Hand and kiſſed it. Allow me, Madam, ſaid I, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a little Neighbour to you; I lodge within a few Doors, and ſhall think myſelf happy in being acquainted in your Family. Alas, my Dear, ſays ſhe, there are very few who ſeek acquaintance with Calamity. They, who wiſh to relieve it, ſeek acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with it, Madam.</p>
               <p>Having eyed me all over, with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Kind of Surprize, you look, my Love,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0237300103:287"/>ſaid ſhe, to be very Good-natured, and I dare ſay will be very charitable when you come to have the Ability. The little A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility I have, Madam, ſhall be ſtrained for your Service. In the mean Time, pray pardon the Freedom I have taken in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tea and Coffee into your Room, with ſome Cakes and Sweetmeats for theſe pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miſſes. I will only trouble you, Madam, with one Gueſt more, it is Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> my Tutor, who, good Man, has been no Stranger to Poverty or Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe called Mr. <hi>Ruth</hi> from an inner Room, give me leave, my Dear, ſays ſhe, to introduce a young Stranger to you, from what World he comes I know not, but I am ſure that he is not wholly of the World that we have lived in.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ruth</hi>'s Countenance ſpoke at once the Meekneſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Patience of <hi>Job.</hi> Having ſaluted, we both ſat down. Mr. <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſaid I, I have a Meſſage to you and your Lady from your ſweet pretty Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Miſs <hi>Diana Stern.</hi> In Token of her Reſpect and Affection for you, ſhe preſents you with this Caſh Note of a hundred Pounds. <hi>Diana Stern!</hi> cried out Mr. <hi>Ruth,</hi> why, Maſter, ſhe is nearly as poor as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. By no Means, Sir, I aſſure you; her Grandfather is come to Town, ſhe is worth ſeveral Thouſands, beſides a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0237300103:288"/>Eſtate to which ſhe is Heireſs. O, the dear Creature, the dear Angel, cried Mrs. <hi>Ruth,</hi> I will inſtantly go and pay her my Acknowledgments; ſo up ſhe got and out ſhe run, before I could prevent her.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſhe was gone, Mr. <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſays I, my Dada is much fonder of me than I deſerve. He has given me a little Money to diſpoſe of, at pleaſure, among the confined Debtors, and though I may not have enough to anſwer your Occaſions, yet my Dada is ſo very good and ſo very generous, that if you give me the Sum of your Debts, with the Story of your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, his Heart, I am ſure, will melt, and he will ſet you clear in the World.</p>
               <p>He made no Anſwer, however, to this my Offer, but, lifting up his Eyes, he cried, well mighteſt thou ſay, great Saviour of the Simple, <hi>ſuffer little Children to come unto me, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> O, thou Babe of the Manger, <hi>thou firſt born of many Brethren,</hi> here, indeed, is a dear and true little Brother of thine, but he ſpeaks in his Simplicity, and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Knowledge. Then, turning toward me, can you gueſs, my Darling, ſaid he, what you undertake to do for me? I queſtion if the Charities of all this Nation would be ſufficient, when united, to effect my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0237300103:289"/>Nothing, nothing but the Arm of the Almighty can do it. He will do it, indeed, in Death; but what then ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my Wife and ſeven Infants, that truly is terrible, is worſe than Death to think of.</p>
               <p>While we were ſpeaking, two ſweet little Fellows came in, the eldeſt very nearly of my Size, but both clad in very thin and poor-looking Apparel. Having kneeled for their Father's Bleſſing, they ſlipt behind us, and, turning my Head to obſerve them, I was quite aſhamed, and drew it back again, on perceiving that the poor Things were unlading their Pockets of old Cruſts and broken Meats, which I ſuppoſed they had begged for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Ruth</hi> juſt then returned, and her Countenance looked ſomething dejected. She took her Seat by her Huſband, and, continuing a while ſilent, ſhe put her Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief before her Eyes, and began in broken Words, Can you gueſs, my Dear, ſaid ſhe, what Sort of a Creature this is whom we have got among us? This little heavenly Impoſtor, to lighten our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would have perſuaded us that the hundred Pounds was the Gift of another, but it is all his own Bounty, it is all his own Graciouſneſs. Come, my Daughters,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0237300103:290"/>come, my Children, kneel down and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn your Thanks to this your Patron, your Benefactor, your little Father here!</p>
               <p>O Dada, you would have pitied me ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, had you ſeen me at that Time. The poor dear Things came, all in a Cluſter, preſſing, and catching, and claſping, and clinging about me; while my Love, and my very Heart was torn, as it were to Fritters among them. So I took them, one by one, in my Arms, and kiſſed and embraced them, very cordially, calling them my Brothers and Siſters. I then took out another hundred Pound Note, and, giving it to the eldeſt of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, here, my Dear, ſaid I, I always loved the little Miſſes better than the little Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; here is for yourſelf and your Siſters to clothe you in a way more becoming your Family. And then taking a Note, of equal Value, I gave it to the eldeſt Son, for himſelf and his Brothers, as I ſaid, to help to educate them in a Manner, more agreeable to the Houſe from whence they came.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Ruth</hi> looked ſo aſtoniſhed at me, and at each other, that, for a while, they were not able to utter a Syllable. And, juſt as they began to make their Acknowledgments, I cried, huſh, huſh! here comes my Tutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0237300103:291"/>
Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> juſt then entered, followed by ſeveral Servants, who carried a Tea Equipage, cold Fowl, baked Meats, with other Paſtries, and ſome Wine.</p>
               <p>Having introduced Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> we all got round the Table, and, after Tea and a further Regale, I beſought Mr. <hi>Ruth</hi> to give us the Story of his Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>My Father, ſaid he, was Baron of <hi>Frankford.</hi> He left my Brother, with the Title, four thouſand five hundred Pounds a Year, entailed however upon me, in caſe of his dying without Male Iſſue. And he left me a ſmall Inheritance of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds yearly, to ſupport, in ſome Meaſure, the Appearance of a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>As my Concern bordered on my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Eſtate, we ſaw one another every Day, and continued, for ſeveral Years, in ſtrait and tender Amity.</p>
               <p>Being both invited, one Day, to dine with other Company, at the Houſe of a Neighbour called Mr. <hi>Heartleſs,</hi> a Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happen'd to be ſtarted over the Bottle, whether the Method of ſetting an Egg on End was originally the Invention of <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> or whether it was communicated to him by ſome other; and I unhappily eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0237300103:292"/>the Opinion that was oppoſite to that of my Brother.</p>
               <p>Now, though the Queſtion was not worth the very Shell of the Egg about which we debated, yet we enter'd as warmly into it as though a Province had lain at Stake; for it is not Truth or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that Diſputants ſeek after; it is Victory alone, that is the Object of their Contention.</p>
               <p>After ſome warm Words, and perſonal Retorts had paſſed between my Brother and me, he ſtarted into ſudden Paſſion and gave me the Lie; whereupon, reaching acroſs the Table, I gave him a Tap on the Cheek with the flat of my Fingers: Then, riſing furiouſly from his Seat, he ſwore a fearful Oath, and cried, I will ruin you, <hi>Harry;</hi> though it coſt me my Eſtate, I will ruin you, <hi>Harry Ruth,</hi> with all who are yours.</p>
               <p>The very next Day he muſter'd his Tenants and Labourers, and coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me with a little Army, he laid moſt of my Fences level with the Earth.</p>
               <p>When I complained of this Violence to my next Neighbours, Mr. <hi>Heartleſs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollow,</hi> they proteſted they would ſtand by me againſt ſuch outrageous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0237300103:293"/>to the laſt of their Fortunes. They then advanced me, between them, five hundred Pounds for the Purpoſe. I immediately commenced Suit againſt my Lord's Tenants. But, though I caſt them all with Coſts, I unhappily found that nearly all my Money was ſunk in the Conteſt.</p>
               <p>Meantime, ſcarce a Day paſſed wherein I was not ſerved with a Subpoena from Chancery, to anſwer ſuch or ſuch a Bill, to which my Brother had procured me to be made a Party. And he alſo enter'd a Suit againſt me, himſelf, in order to inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate my Father's Will, whereby I claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my little Patrimony.</p>
               <p>When I told this to my Friend Mr. <hi>Hollow,</hi> he broke into a loud Laugh. Your Title? cried he; the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not invalidate your Title, Mr. <hi>Ruth;</hi> I will let you have a thouſand Pounds upon it To morrow; and this I was under the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of accepting ſoon after.</p>
               <p>Contention ſerves, with mutual Hands, to ſhut every Door againſt Reconciliation. The more I had loved my Brother, the more I now deteſted him. Inſtead of any Submiſſion or Overture to appeaſe him, my Lips uttered, in daily Invectives, the Overflowings of my Heart; as I alſo was
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0237300103:294"/>aſſured that, on his Part, he wiſhed me nothing leſs than eternal Perdition. Thus we burned, on both Sides, with unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fire, and the Kingdom of <hi>Satan</hi> was fully opened within us.</p>
               <p>At length, my Body was impriſoned, at the Suit of my Neighbour <hi>Heartleſs,</hi> for 750<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and my Lands were taken under Execution, at the Suit of my Neighbour <hi>Hollow,</hi> for the Sum of 2000<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> But, I ſoon was informed that all this Money was my Brother's, who had advanced it, from Time to Time, to thoſe his clandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Correſpondents, in order to haſten and deepen my Deſtruction. When I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this, I raged, I was all on Fire; and I took a horrid Pleaſure in the Notion of having the Fangs of a Tyger, that I might tear my Brother Piecemeal, and my falſe Friends, Limb from Limb, and feaſt my Spirit on their Pangs, and mine Eyes on their Carnage.</p>
               <p>But when I turned a Look on my Wife and ſeven Infants, Grief joined with Rage to tear me by a double Diſtraction. I curſed the Lot to which I was appointed upon Earth; and I ſhould have ſought ſome deſperate Means of putting an End to my Torments and Exiſtence together, but that I dreaded, by my Death, to give
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0237300103:295"/>Pleaſure to my Brother, ten times more than I dreaded the Pain of Death itſelf.</p>
               <p>O, my Friends, had all that ever were ſainted come and preached to me, the Peace of our Lord Chriſt, at that Seaſon, it would have been no more than beating the Air, or ſtriving with ſo many Spunges, to make an Impreſſion on a Block of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is Diſtreſs alone that, by Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, makes Impreſſion; that preaches the internal Doctrine of ſenſible Mortification, and humbles a proud Spirit, by plucking away all its Props.</p>
               <p>At firſt, I was as a Worm under the Foot of my God. I turned, and ſtruggled, and writhed, and fought with all my Force againſt the Cruſher. But, alas! all was in vain; he was too mighty for me; and Oppoſition ſerved only to add to my Anguiſh.</p>
               <p>At length, I was compelled to acquieſce, rather through the want of Power than the want of Will to reſiſt. And I lay, as it were, without Motion, under his Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; at the ſame Time that my Heart reproached him, in ſecret.</p>
               <p>Having ſold all our Moveables, and even our wearing Apparel for Suſtenance, we were reduced to the Neceſſity of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0237300103:296"/>our eldeſt Boys to beg Fragments of Victuals at Kitchen Windows, to keep us from utterly famiſhing. This I held to be ſuch a further Shame and Diſgrace as ſtung my Soul to the quick; I therefore began to kick againſt theſe Pricks alſo; but finding that, the more I ſpurned, the ſtronger I was held and preſſed into the Duſt, I gave up all Reſiſtance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented myſelf with grieving and weeping under the Hand of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>From hence I gradually ſunk into a State of reſigned Serenity which, although without Sunſhine, was yet without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance. My Fury ſmoothed its Creſt, my Paſſions ſubſided, and I felt nothing more of Rancour againſt my Brother, or Reſiſtance againſt my God.</p>
               <p>The Activity of the Soul will find itſelf Employment. As I had now no further Proſpect or Concern upon Earth, I began to turn my Thoughts and Attention to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Heaven. I locked myſelf into yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Cloſet. I threw myſelf into the Duſt. I have ſinned, I cried, I have greatly ſinned, O God! I am nothing, I am cruſhed even lower than the nothing that I am; ſpare, ſpare me from a deeper Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I beſeech thee!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0237300103:297"/>
I felt that my Prayer was heard; Peace deſcended upon me like Dew upon the Night. The-Day Star began gradually to dawn to my Soul. The dark Kingdom of <hi>Satan</hi> gave way before the Kingdom of the Son of Light and Love; and I would no more have entertained any one of my former Paſſions, than I would have taken burning Coals and have buttoned them up in my Boſom.</p>
               <p>I was greatly delighted, Dada, with this Part and ſome more of Mr. <hi>Ruth</hi>'s Story, and I got him to repeat it over and over, that I might remember it the better.</p>
               <p>I now, continued he, I now pitied my Brother as much as ever I had hated him. I grieved for having cauſed the Loſs of his Peace. I wiſhed to reſtore it to him. I wrote a penitential Acknowledgment of my Faults. I beſought his Pardon, in the humbleſt Manner, for the unfortunate Blow. I ſubſcribed to the Juſtice of my conſequent Sufferings; and I ſent my Son, here, to attend his Lordſhip with my lowly Addreſs.</p>
               <p>The Triumph, which this Humiliation gave to my Brother, ſupplied him with Patience to go through my Memorial. But then conceiving, as I ſuppoſe, that it
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0237300103:298"/>was dictated by mercenary Meanneſs and Hypocriſy, he tore it to Pieces and daſhed it into the Fire. Then, returning to my Child the Box which had ſo enflamed the Soul of his Lordſhip, he kicked my poor little Fellow out of his Houſe.</p>
               <p>My Child came home to me, weeping ſadly; but I conſoled him the beſt I could, and mingled my Tears with his; not in any Reſentment for the Treatment receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but through Grief for the Inveteracy of my unhappy Brother. O my God, I cried, I no longer repine at my Abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the Weight of my Sufferings and Mortifications; I bleſs thee for them, O God; they have proved my beſt Friends, my moſt ſalutary Phyſicians. Cruel and ſtern, indeed, is the Porter who ſtands at the Iron Gate of Pain; but O, it opens upon Regions of inward Delight; for he who clothed himſelf with the Croſs is all glorious within.</p>
               <p>My happy Experience of this Truth opened, for me, a new Proſpect into the Myſtery of God's Diſpenſation to Mortals; and threw a Number of ſhining Lights on thoſe very Articles of Goſpel-Redemption, which had formerly appeared to me ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable and gloomy. If God, ſaid I to myſelf, hath ſuffered Man to fall, he
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0237300103:299"/>hath alſo provided for him every poſſible Means of Recovery and Reſtoration.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when Sin came into the World, God alſo ſent Suffering, its inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Attendant, to be a Cure and an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote to the Poiſon thereof. If Sin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hath thruſt the Kingdom of Heaven from within us, Suffering comes, as God's Forerunner; it relaxes and unfolds the brazen Gates of our polluted Temple, that Chriſt our Righteouſneſs may enter, the very Hem of whoſe Garment is Salvation to every Soul that lays hold upon it.</p>
               <p>Here I took Mr. <hi>Ruth</hi> about the Neck, and, kiſſing him, ſaid, that I was ſure my Dada would be willing to pay his whole Debt in Return for the ſweet Inſtructions which he had given to his <hi>Harry.</hi> You ſpeak of your Dada, my Dear, ſaid he, as though he were the Repreſentative of God, in the Goſpel, who forgave to his Servant ten thouſand Talents. What you have given me already, Maſter, is beyond any human Bounty that ever I hear'd of. I ſhall therefore lay by two of theſe Notes, till I am better informed how far your good Father may be ſatisfied with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Soon after, we took leave, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, of this honourable Family. We
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0237300103:300"/>then went among the other principal Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, whoſe Diſtreſſes indeed were great, though their Stories, except one, had little ſingular in them. In order to make our Money go as far as we could, we hurried here and there, through the Town, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding with the ſeveral Creditors, from eight to ten and twelve and fifteen Shillings in the Pound; ſo that, for about ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds, we diſcharged a Number who were indebted to the amount of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> about Noon, in the laſt Week, I ſtepped to Mr. <hi>Ruth</hi>'s to ſee if the Family had been decently clad, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my Requeſt. There I found him and his four Sons clothed in warm and clean, though very coarſe Apparel; and he told me, that his Wife had gone abroad with her three Daughters, in order to put them alſo into a ſuitable Condition.</p>
               <p>While I ſat with him, a young Woman came in, of a very genteel Appearance, though in a plain Dreſs. Don't you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Girl, Sir, ſaid ſhe, to Mr. <hi>Ruth,</hi> who uſed to come to you, over Night, in a green Kerchief and a little red Mantle. I ſhould be very ungrateful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſaid he, if any Change of Dreſs could conceal from my Remembrance that ſweet and charitable Countenance. O Sir,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0237300103:301"/>ſhe cried, the few Shillings that I brought you, from Time to Time, came from a very affectionate Hand, though from a Hand you would little ſuſpect of any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection toward you; they came from your loving Niece <hi>Belinda Ruth,</hi> who has ſhed many a Shower of Tears on your Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. May Heaven be her Portion, cried out the good Man, ſince Earth has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing equal to ſo much Goodneſs. Indeed, Sir, continued the Girl, the little that your Niece ſent you was procured with much Difficulty and Danger to herſelf; for, from the Time that, on her Knees and with a Deluge of Tears, ſhe petitioned her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in your behalf, he kept a watchful Eye over her, and took from her all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Truſts; ſo that ſhe had nothing wherewith to ſupply you, except the Price of ſome caſt Gowns, and of other little Matters that ſhe feigned to have loſt. Moreover, my Lord ſwore vehemently that, if ever ſhe furniſhed you with the Value of a Farthing, or kept any kind of Correſpondence with you or with yours, he would diſown and turn her into the public Streets.</p>
               <p>You alarm me greatly, cried out Mr. <hi>Ruth.</hi> Is any thing amiſs, has any thing happened to my dear Child? She was a lovely little Lamb, a little Angel from her Cradle; though I ſhould not know her,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0237300103:302"/>now, if ſhe ſtood erect before me. I hope, I ſay—tell me—proceed, I beſeech you!</p>
               <p>There was a Servant, Sir, a Man whom your Niece thought very faithful, and therefore entruſted with the Secret of my coming to you, that he might attend and ſee me ſafe back again. This Fellow, preſuming on the Confidence that was placed in him, would, this Morning, have taken indecent Liberties with his young Miſtreſs. This ſhe reſented in a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Manner, and threatened to complain of his Inſolence to her Father. The revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Villain inſtantly ran, and told the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to his Lord with many Aggravations, as though his Daughter was robbing him of all his Subſtance. Thereupon ſhe was haſtily called, and, having in Part confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Charge, my Lord drew his Sword in his Fury, whereupon, giving a Shriek and a ſudden Spring, ſhe got out of his Preſence, and has ſent me to know, Sir, if you will be pleaſed to receive her?</p>
               <p>Yes, cried Mr. <hi>Ruth,</hi> to my Boſom, to my Heart; with the ſame Pleaſure and Welcome that a Convict receives Pardon on the Hour of Execution.</p>
               <p>Juſt then Mrs. <hi>Ruth</hi> enter'd, with her three Daughters, who, running up to their
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0237300103:303"/>Father, dropped together on their Knees before him for a Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>While his Hands and Eyes were raiſed in Prayer over them, the young Stranger ſtepped earneſtly up, and, falling on her Knees beſide the Daughters, ſhe broke into Tears, and cried aloud, bleſs me, bleſs me alſo, O my Father! I am your Niece, your <hi>Belinda,</hi> my Father is no more! Yours, my Lord, is the Title, yours all the Poſſeſſion; I now, in my Turn, depend on your Bounty for a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Bread. My Brother, my Brother dead! exclaimed Mr. <hi>Ruth.</hi> He is, my Lord, ſhe replied; he was ſuffocated by his riſing Choler, and expired on the Spot.</p>
               <p>While the young Lady ſpoke, Mrs. <hi>Ruth</hi> looked, as quite terrified by the Tidings of ſuch a ſudden Elevation; and clapping her Hands together, and lifting her Eyes, ſhe cried, it cannot be, it is impoſſible! Ours the Title, ours the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune!—O my God!—O my Huſband!—O my Children!—and down ſhe dropped.</p>
