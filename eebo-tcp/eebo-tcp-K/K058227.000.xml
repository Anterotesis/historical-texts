            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>To plead a brother's cauſe, who trembling ſtands behind,</l>

                  <l>"The bud muſt open, ere the flower appears."</l>

                  <l>Let but your gen'rous plaudits diſſipate his fear,</l>
                  <l>To bolder heigths hereafter he may wing his flight,</l>

                  <l>Without it in vain is our ſtudy and labour.</l>
                  <l>To each critic I ſue—on each fair one rely,</l>
                  <l>Many looks of indulgence methinks I eſpy.</l>

                  <l>The nice Fop of the age, and the Libertine too,</l>
                  <l>Their vices and follies hold up to deriſion,</l>
                  <l>That feeling its force they may ſhew their contrition.</l>
                  <l>Virtue and beauty's charms he likewiſe ſets to view,</l>
                  <l>All-powerful charms, ſuch as ſhou'd ev'ry heart ſubdue.</l>
                  <l>From nature's wide and ample field his plan he draws,</l>
                  <l>And hopes to pleaſe you all by her unerring laws.</l>
                  <l>Then with candour attend—let no prejudice riſe,</l>
                  <l>But ſhew yourſelves pleas'd both with hands and with eyes,</l>

                  <p>Oh, that's eaſily accounted for—It is becauſe you left that dear, ſweet, ſighing ſwain of yours, Mr. Wilville, behind—Tho' Sir Harry Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was with him, yet I was not ſad—Our journey, to me, ſeem'd enchantingly pleaſant—Oh, Lud!—The ſwiftneſs of our expedition—the variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects—the uncommon politeneſs we were treated with on the road—the amazing noiſe, hurry, and buſtle we ſaw in coming hither, has filled my mind with images I never had the leaſt Idea of before—Oh! happy, happy creatures, who continually enjoy ſuch bleſſings without interruption.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps, not ſo happy as you imagine, ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—There may be real enjoyments here as well as in retirement, but I am apt to think true content is eaſier to be found in the moſs-grown cot, than the cloud-aſpiring dome.</p>

                  <speaker>Miſs Lamb.</speaker>
                  <p>There again we differ—I am heartily weary of ſolitude, and leave to you the undiſturbed enjoyment of going to reſt with the ſun, that, like him, you may be the harbinger of morn—treading the cowſlip bending green, to viſit your lowing herds, who conſtantly welcome and reward you with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing bowls of nectar—at noon, feaſting on pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal luxuries—towards eve—but let that ſuffice. Contraſt it with what Lord Promiſe told us of a ſine lady's life—Riſing at noon—paying morning viſits—
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0341600300:26"/>dining at ſix—dreſſing—then whirling away to routs, balls, aſſemblies, maſquerades, where brilliant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, muſic, dancing, and card parties make the time glide inſenſibly away, till bluſhing morn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds the fringed curtains of the gilded eaſt, and tears them unwillingly from their half enjoyed pleaſures—If ſuch a deſcription be true, who, in their ſenſes, wou'd have a doubt which to prefer?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                  <p>Siſter, we had better not entirely depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Lord Promiſe told us—A little time, I am afraid, will diſpel the miſt which overſhadows your reaſon?</p>

                  <speaker>Miſs Lamb.</speaker>
                  <p>Then if it be a miſt, ſiſter, I never deſire it to be removed—Adieu, I hope for ever, to thoſe purling rills, deep embower'd ſhades, and fleecy nibblers of the plain, that hitherto have been our companions; a brighter ſcene now opens to my view, and if Sir Harry Temple knew but where to trace us, my joys then wou'd be compleat.</p>

                  <p>Flatter not yourſelf ſo much, Charlotte, as to imagine we have ſuch power over them—To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident only are we indebted for their acquaintance—nor have we a right to expect it to continue—'Tis true, they did us a ſignal piece of ſervice in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing us from ſuch a crew of gypſies, who, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us where they did, wou'd probably have robb'd, perhaps murder'd us.</p>

                  <p>The adventure was ſo much to my taſte, that I enjoyed it—My champion, I thought, received my acknowledgments with ſurprize—Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,

                  <p>How, Sir? I hope not—I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fulſil the will of him who placed me in ſuch a ſituation, and that I thought the principal end of my creation—If I have erred, I truſt he will forgive me.</p>

                  <p>I am glad to find it ſo, Sir—tho' 'tis more than I can ſay for myſelf <stage>(aſide)</stage>—But Lord Promiſe wiſhes to reward ſuch goodneſs in this world—He has many relations of great dignity in the world—They have heard your character from the Earl, and you may depend upon being ſpeedily provided for.</p>

                  <p>I believe not, Sir—On the contrary, the long heart-felt ſerenity I've enjoy'd, has expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every grateful and noble thought within me.</p>

                  <p>Nay, I ſhou'd not wonder at it—Perſons long buried in ſolitude, are apt to look with a gloomy aſpect on the harmleſs amuſements of the world—And thoſe things, in their nature perfectly innocent, they, with a cynic ſeverity, condemn as abſolutely criminal.</p>

                  <p>Ay, ſo did I—We drove jehu like for it—and yet the curſed poſt-boys cou'd not get on faſt enough to ſatisfy my impatience—Zounds! I wou'd have outſtript the wind, and ſurpaſs'd all the fables of antiquity to have caught them—the laſt ſtage I was almoſt ſure of it—they were not above half an hour before—Such a diſappointment is enough to turn the brain of a philoſopher!</p>

                  <p>MY dear Wilville, I am very much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to you for this viſit, I intended call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on you in a few days.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wil.</speaker>
                  <p>On me; for what, pray?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Epi.</speaker>
                  <p>Pſha! a triſle—There's a ſubſcription amongſt a few of us men of taſte to raiſe ten thouſand pounds, to divide between three Italian ſingers and two capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal French dancers, to be invited over for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe next winter. That ſum, with what the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers can give, benefits, and a few triſting preſents, will enable them to live tolerably genteel, and oblige foreigners to confeſs that no nation out-does us in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity to ſtrangers—Will you make one?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wil.</speaker>
                  <p>I can't ſay that I have the leaſt inclination, and muſt think half that ſum beſtow'd on natives of merit and character, wou'd be infinitely more laudable.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Epi.</speaker>
                  <p>May I renounce every thing that's foreign if I think ſo—for in my opinion, a man cannot give a greater proof of the remains of old Engliſh barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, than by encouraging natives, let their merit be ever ſo deſerving—'tis as great a vulgariſm, and as much out of faſhion, as relieving the poor of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh one lives in.</p>
