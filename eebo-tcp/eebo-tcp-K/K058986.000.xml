            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE following Piece is founded on the Iſola Diſabitata of the celebrated ABBE METASTASIO: In reading the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that great Genius, the preſent Writer received ſo exquiſite a Pleaſure, that he contracted a Paſſion for the Subject, and could not refrain from exerciſing his Pen upon it. In the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Plan, he knew enough of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Theatre, to perceive that it was thin of what our Play-followers call Buſineſs; and he was aware that on the Stage it might prove (to uſe <hi>Milton</hi>'s Words) <hi>very different from what among us paſſes for Beſt.</hi> The ſame Remark was made by a Friend of the Author's, who thought it hazardous to offer to a popular Aſſembly a Piece, in which there were none of thoſe Strokes that generally ſucceed with the Multitude. "Can't you," ſaid he, <q>throw in ſomething here and there to ſeaſon it more to the public Appetite?—Suppoſe you were to change the Title, and fix the Scene among the <hi>Anthropophagi,</hi> or among the <hi>Men, whoſe Heads do grow beneath their Shoulders</hi>—a few of thoſe extraordinary Perſonages exhibited on the Stage, will prove very acceptable:—What think you of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Servant in it?—That certainly will inſure Succeſs, the more eſpecially if you add ſome aerial Beings, and conclude the Whole with a drunken Song by the Tars of <hi>Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </q>—The Author was ſenſible of the Force of theſe Obſervations; but the GREAT MILTON (mentioned above) ſtared him in the Face, with his Reflections on <q>the Error of introducing tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial and vulgar Perſons, which, by all Judicious, hath been counted abſurd, and brought in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſcretion, CORRUPTLY to gratify the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide,</hi> Preface to <hi>Samſon Agoniſtes.</hi>
               </note>—He therefore determined to preſerve the
<pb facs="tcp:0055200700:4"/>
Integrity of his original Deſign, and to try what would be the Effect of a ſimple Fable, with, but few Incidents, ſupported entirely by the Spirit of Poetry, Sentiment, and Paſſion. To combine theſe there Qualities is indeed an arduous Taſk; and the Author, therefore, does not flatter himſelf that he has entirely ſucceeded in ſo difficult an Attempt.</p>
            <p>In Juſtice to METASTASIO, he thinks proper to inform the mere <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader, that he hath not been a Tranſlator on this Occaſion, but has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Impulſe of his own Imagination, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting in a few Paſſages. The ITALIAN POET gave the Fable; the preſent Writer made his own Uſe of it; or in other Words, the Ground-work, or <hi>Canevas,</hi> (as the <hi>French</hi> call it) is METASTASIO'S; for the Colouring Mr. <hi>Murphy</hi> is anſwerable.</p>
            <p>He could not but be ſurprized to find that, on the firſt Night, the Scene in the third Act, between <hi>Sylvia</hi> and <hi>Henrico,</hi> was deemed equivocal. There is always a ſufficient Number ready to aſcribe to an Author various Meanings, which he never had, "and ſee at Cannon's what was never there."—To theſe Gentlemen he returns his Thanks; but the Species of Wit, which they are willing to allow him, he begs leave publickly to diſclaim. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Girl, who has never ſeen a Man, and who has been taught to think of ſuch a Being with Horror, is merely imaginary; but the poſſible, or Poetical Exiſtence of ſuch a Girl being once eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, it is to be wiſhed that the Critics would agree what Queſtions it is natural for her to aſk on her firſt Interview with a Man, METASTASIO makes her ſay,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Che vuoi da me?</l>
               <l>Un Uom Sei dunque!</l>
               <l>Andiamo Inſieme.</l>
               <l>Ah! troppo ron trattenerli, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0055200700:5"/>And theſe little Touches, (ſo differently do we judge in <hi>England</hi>) were thought abroad to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Strokes of the moſt elegant Simplicity.</p>
            <p>He could wiſh it had been univerſally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that it was not a TRAGEDY he offered to the Public, but a DRAMATIC POEM; that is to ſay, a Piece with ſome intereſting Situations to engage the Affections, but which affords more Room for a Pictureſque Imagination to diſplay itſelf, than is generally allowed to the more important Concerns of real Tragedy, where the Diſtreſs ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways encreaſing, where the Paſſions ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways riſing to fuller and ſtronger Emotions, and where of Courſe the Poet ought not to find Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for Imagery and Deſcription. Had this been felt and acknowledged, no Body would have looked for another Kind of Entertainment than was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and the Smiles ariſing from SYLVIA'S Dread of a Man (on the firſt Diſcovery of him), and her gradual Attachment to him in Compliance with natural Inſtinct, would never have been judged inconſiſtent with the Colour of the Whole. But if the Author of the <hi>Deſert Iſland</hi> has erred in this, he has the Conſolation of having erred with the greateſt Poet now in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As many of the malevolent Writers of the Age have heretofore honoured the Author with their Abuſe, and as he was apprehenſive that they ſtill remained under the Oppreſſion of their Dullneſs and Obſcurity, it was deemed proper to call them forth into Daylight, by exhibiting one general Repreſentative of them all on the Stage. For this he returns his Thanks to the Author of the Prologue; and if any needy Bookſellers, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Authors, can find their Account in taking further Liberties with him, he hereby declares, he ſhould be ſorry not to have Merit enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke ſome of them, and for their Encouragement,
<pb facs="tcp:0055200700:6"/>
he adds in the Words of the noble Author of the <hi>Characteriſtics,</hi> that <q>He will never reply, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſhould hear of them or their Works in any good Company a Twelve-month after.</q>
