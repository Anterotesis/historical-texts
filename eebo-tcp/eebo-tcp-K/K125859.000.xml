            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

THE CITY OF CARLISLE.</head>
               <p>THE traveller approaching from the ſouth, has the beſt view of the city, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a fine eminence, gradually emerging from an extenſive plain of rich cultivated land. The waters of the Frith are ſeen on the one hand, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent levells; the back ground of the landſcape is beautifully variegated by the irregular ſwells of the whole Scotch promontory, extending towards the Iriſh ſea. The walls ſtrengthened with an arrangement of buttreſſes at irregular diſtances, lies upon one angle to the view; in part, concealing the houſes of the city, and boldly overtoped by the ſquare tower of the caſtle, and the auguſt and ſolemn ſtructure of the cathedral. This view of Carliſle is the more ſtriking, as there is no adjacent eminence; from which cauſe the city looks more majeſtic, as it crowns ſo beautiful a plain.</p>
               <p>The city is walled round, the fortifications towards Scotland appearing the moſt modern; they are formed of better ſquared ſtones than ſeveral other parts of the works. The eaſt and ſouth ſides are ſupported by a multitude of buttreſſes, which, we preſume, have been built up occaſionally, to ſtrengthen the decaying parts of the wall. It is watered by three fine rivers, the Eden on the north, the Peterill on the eaſt, and Caude on the weſt. There are three gates to the city, which, from their different aſpects, are called the Engliſh, Iriſh, and Scotch Gates. On
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0873500300:6"/>the approach from Penrith, on the ſouth, you enter the Engliſh Gates; on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach from Wigton, on the ſouth-weſt, is the Iriſh Gate; and the Scotch Gate, to the north, opens upon the bridges. The walls are embrazured, but without any earth-work. The Engliſh Gate is guarded by a very ſtrong machicolated gate, flanked by circular towers of great ſtrength; the guns mounted therein in ſeveral tiers, would effectually ſweep every approach. This gateway, with its towers and other works, is commonly called the Citadel,
<note n="†" place="bottom">"An oblong with three round baſtions."—PENNANT.—The ancient entrance into the city was through the citadel.</note> and was erected by the order of King Henry VIII. The caſtle conſiſts of various works, but being kept up as a garriſoned place, we conceive it imprudent to deſcribe them minutely.
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>There were ſeveral officers appointed to this fortreſs, viz. a governor, deputy governor, town-major, engineer, barrack-maſter, ſtore-keeper, head gunner, three quarter gunners, and a perſon to buy in and deliver out coals and candles to the garriſon. For many years, prior to 1761, the governor of this city was choſen from one of the repreſentatives in parliament; and moſt of the ſubordinate places in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon were given to the freemen of the city, and generally members of the corporation, ſo that frequently the chief magiſtrate was a quarter gunner.—L. [For a liſt of the governors ſee page 595.</p>
                  </note> The donjon, or great tower, more properly deſerves the title of the citadel, being ſurrounded by the other works; it is ſquare and very lofty, and the walls of vaſt ſtrength and thickneſs, being conſtructed agreeably to the old modes of defence, before the uſe of cannon: it was ſtrengthened by a draw bridge over a wide ditch, and defended by modern works; a half-moon battery mounted with cannon, and a very large platform alſo mounted with cannon, under cover of the outward wall. The top of the tower being embrazured and lined with turf, and mounted with large cannon, this part of the fortreſs could make a good defence, and ſuſtain a formidable attack. By a well of vaſt depth conſtructed within the great tower, and ſaid to be of Roman work, the ſupply of water for the garriſon could not be cut off by an enemy. This well is not unlike that in Bambrough Caſtle in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, and has been conſtructed at the ſame time the great tower was built.
<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>In the gates of the caſtle, is ſtill remaining the old Portcullis: and here are ſhewn the apartments of Mary, Queen of Scots, where ſhe was lodged ſome time after her landing at Workington; and after being, for a little ſpace, entertained with flattering reſpect, found herſelf priſoner to her jealous rival.</p>
                  </note> In the outer caſtle is a fine graſs plot, a garden and governor's houſe.</p>
               <p>But it will be expected by our readers, that we give a more particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this city, and collect the hiſtorical facts relative to it.</p>
               <p>The name of Carliſle has been deduced by ſeveral authors, from different ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies. The Britiſh chronicle informs us, this city was built by a Britiſh potentate, called Luel. Leland ſays, <q>the Iriſhmen call <hi>bale</hi> a town, and ſo peradventure did the old Scottes: thus might be ſaid that <hi>lugabalia</hi> ſoundeth <hi>Luel's-town.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <p>Lel. Itin. v. vii. p. 48.—In Leland's Collectaniae, vol. ii. p. 19. Extract from the 14th chapter, of the 1ſt book of Galfridus, <q>Qui ut properitate regni uſus eſt, in Aquilonari parte Britanniae civitatem aedificavit, quam de nomine ejus Caer-leil vocant.</q> Leil alias Luel, filius Bruti. cog. viridis ſcuti, condidit Caerliel.</p>
                  </note> The Romans called it <hi>Lugovallium,</hi> or <hi>Luguballum,</hi> from its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation on Severus' wall, and from the troops and people garriſoned there. <hi>Ptolemy</hi> calls it <hi>Leucopibi, Nennius Caer Lualid.</hi> The Saxons retained the old name <hi>Luel;</hi> the Welſh writers give it the name of the city of <hi>Duballus.</hi> Some derive the name
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0873500300:7"/>from the ancient Britiſh <hi>Llu-gyda-gwal,</hi> which implies <hi>an army by the wall;</hi> from whence it is aſſerted the Romans framed their appellation of <hi>Lugovallium;</hi> others from <hi>Lagus,</hi> or <hi>Lucus,</hi> which, in the language of the <hi>Celtae</hi> and Britains, ſignified a tower; and which, with the Roman compound, expreſſed <hi>a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum:</hi> to the Saxon name was added, the word <hi>caer,</hi> or city; and from theſe, <hi>Caer Leuel,</hi> the preſent name of <hi>Car-liſle,</hi> ſeems to come by an eaſy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is reaſonable to apprehend, that in ſo fine a ſituation, on the confluence of three rivers, and the grand eſtuarie of the Frith, this place was of ſome ſtrength and diſtinction before the coming of the Romans: it will naturally follow, that the name was given antecedent to the building of Severus' wall, or the vallum of Hadrian; and we conceive that Leland points out the moſt probable etymology. <hi>Camden</hi> and his editors have taken great pains on this ſubject, <q>The Romans and Britains called it <hi>Luguvallum</hi> and <hi>Luguballium,</hi> or <hi>Luguballia;</hi> the Saxons, as <hi>Bede</hi> writeth, <hi>Luel; Ptolemy,</hi> as ſome think, <hi>Lucopibia,</hi> (which ſeems rather to be a corruption of <gap reason="foreign">

But as to the etymology, what pains has our countryman, <hi>Leland,</hi> taken about it, and at laſt he is driven upon this ſhift, that <hi>Ituna</hi> might be called <hi>Lugas,</hi> and that <hi>Ballum</hi> came from <hi>Vallis,</hi> a valley, and ſo make <hi>Lugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallum,</hi> as much as a <hi>valley</hi> upon the <hi>Luge.</hi> But to give my conjectures alſo, I dare affirm, that the <hi>vallum</hi> and <hi>valia</hi> were derived from that famous military <hi>vallum</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which runs hard by the city. For <hi>Antoninus</hi> calls <hi>Lugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallum ad vallum;</hi> and the Picts wall, which was afterwards built on the wall of <hi>Severus,</hi> is to be ſeen at Stanwicks, a ſmall village a little beyond the Eden. It paſſed the river over againſt the caſtle; where, in the very channel, the remains of it, namely, great ſtones appear to this day. Alſo, <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> has told us, that <hi>lugus</hi> or <hi>lucus</hi> ſignified a <hi>tower</hi> among the old <hi>Celtae,</hi> who ſpoke the ſame language with the Britains; for what <hi>Antoninus</hi> calls <hi>lugo auguſti,</hi> is in him <hi>turris auguſti;</hi> ſo that <hi>luguvallum,</hi> both really is, and ſignifies <hi>a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum.</hi> Upon this foundation, if the French had made their <hi>lugdunum</hi> ſignify a tower upon a hill, and their <hi>lucotetia</hi> (ſo the ancients called what we call <hi>lutetia</hi>) a beautiful tower; for the words import ſo much in the Britiſh, they might poſſibly have been more in the right, than by deriving the latter from <hi>lutum,</hi> dirt; and the former from one <hi>Lugdus,</hi> a fabulous king. As to the preſent name, <hi>Carliſle,</hi> the original of this is plain enough, from the Britiſh, <hi>caer,</hi> a city; and <hi>Lual, Luel, Lugubal, Leil,</hi> or <hi>Luil,</hi> according to the ſeveral appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, antient or modern, importing as much as <hi>the town or city of Luul,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0873500300:8"/>It has been the opinion of ſeveral judicious viſitants, that the river Eden has ſhifted its courſe and channel ſince the time of the Romans, and that formerly it paſſed nearer to the caſtle; for it ſhould ſeem an inconſiſtent taſk for that wiſe people, to make their work traverſe a rapid and broad river, otherwiſe than in a direct line. Both Mr. Horſley, and Mr. Warburton join in this opinion.</p>
               <p>It may ſafely be determined, that the Romans found this a place of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; but that it was, in their time, rather a place of receſs after the toils of warfare were over, than a place of chief ſtrength, appears from the vicinity of Stanwix, the ſtation in courſe upon the wall. It is not to be doubted, but Caer-Luel was fortified, as it lay too near the borders not to be ſubject to perils and alarms; but we have no Roman authorities, to denominate it a regular Roman city or ſtation; as we find thoſe neareſt to the wall, on the ſouth, were Olenacum, now called Old Carlifle, near Wigton; and Bremetenracum, called old Perith. The words of Camden and his editors are, <q>That this city flouriſhed in the time of the Romans, appears plainly enough from the ſeveral evidences of antiquity, which they now and then dig up; and from the frequent mention made of it, by the writers of thoſe times. And even after the ravages of the Picts and Scots, it retained ſomething of its ancient ſplendor, and was accounted a city.</q>

                        <q>That it was a place of ſtrength in the time of the Romans, is evident; not only from the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in the accounts they took of Britain, when they had made it a province of the empire but alſo from Roman mounments, and inſcriptions that have been ſome time dug up here; one whereof is mentioned by Malmſbury, p. 258. to have been diſcovered in the time of William Rufus.</q>

It would even be a conſiderable time after their introduction, before they could extend their arms to theſe weſtern parts. During this period, and in the darkneſs in which the hiſtory of thoſe ages is involved, we are left to conjecture, that this now flouriſhing city lay in aſhes and ruin, till ******* Egfrid poſſeſſing the diadem of Northumbria, carried his conqueſt to the weſtern ocean. The Britons in this mountainous country, long retained their natural ferocity, and ſupported their uncivilized liberty and independance. Egfrid had Cumberland as a tributary province of his kingdom; and from that period we gain ſome degree of certainty in the hiſtory of this place.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0873500300:15"/>as it is ſaid, was erected in the reign of King Henry VIII.; and it is ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the whole caſtle and fortifications ſhould ſo ſoon fall into ſuch decay, as to be in the ſtate repreſented by that report, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It appears thereby, that the works conſiſted of a donjon, whoſe walls are twelve feet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0873500300:16"/>in thickneſs, an inward and outward ward; the walls of the outward ward, nine feet in thickneſs, and eighteen feet in height; and the walls of the inner ward, twelve feet, having a half-moon baſtion. A tower, called the Captain's Tower. Two gates, one to each ward. In the caſtle a great chamber and a hall, but no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0873500300:17"/>ſtorehouſe for amunition. In the walls of the town, three gate-way towers, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircular baſtion, called Springold Tower: and add to theſe, the citadel. But beſides thoſe mentioned in the report, the walls were garniſhed with ſeveral ſquare towers, particularly a tower at the weſtern ſally port, and a tower called the Tile Tower, of particular ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Before we quit the ſubject of the caſtle, we muſt remark the beautiful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive proſpect which you command from the great tower. The foreground is formed of level meads, waſhed by Eden; in one part, inſulated by a ſeparation of the river. This plot is ornamented by two fine ſtone bridges, one of four, the other of nine arches, the great paſſage towards Scotland. The hanging banks are crowded with the village and church of Stanwix, and the diſtant ground filled with the mountains of Bewcaſtle. To the ſouth, you command the plains to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Penrith, ſhut in on either hand by a vaſt chain of mountains; over which Croſs-fell and Skiddaw are diſtinctly ſeen, greatly eminent. To the eaſt, a varied tract of cultivated country, ſcattered over with villages and hamlets, mingling beautifully with woodlands on the extenſive landſcape: the diſtant horizon form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the heights of Northumberland. To the weſt, the Frith ſpreads out its

               <p>The parts of the CATHEDRAL now remaining, ſhew, that the old ſtructure when it was intire, was a noble and ſolemn ediſice. <q>The body of the cathedral chyrch ys of an older building than the quyer; and yt ys as a filial derived from St. Oſwald's faſt by Pontfret.</q> Lel. Itin. vol. VII. page. 48.—but ſince his days, it has undergone great change, as will be ſhewn in the ſequel. The preſent edifice conſiſts of the eaſt limb of the croſs, being the chancel, and the croſs aile or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſept, with the tower: the greateſt part of the weſt limb of the croſs, having been pulled down in the civil wars, 1641: with the materials they erected a guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe at every gate of the city, and one in the market-place; and two batteries in the caſtle. The circular arches and maſſive round columns, <q>whoſe ſhafts are only fourteen feet two inches high, and circumference full ſeven and a half,</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pennant.</note> which remain of the weſt limb and tranſept, are of the heavieſt order of the Saxon architecture; and at the firſt ſight, teſtify the different ages in which this part and the chancel were erected: indeed the architecture denotes an earlier aera than the time of William Rufus, and probably here is a part of the work of the age of St. Cuthbert: but there is no corroborating evidence to attend the mode of building, which might prove ſo ancient a date. The weſt end is ſaid to have been, in length, 135 feet from the croſs aile, of which 43 feet remains, it being diſmembered of 92 feet. It is not in our power to determine how often this church was reſtored; it is evident that the Danes laid this city in aſhes, and that King William Rufus, under his truſty nominee Walter,
<note n="‡" place="bottom">The Magna Bait. has it, that D. King of Scotland, built a great part of this cathedral.</note> reſtored the city and the public buildings: but ſo early as the reign of King Henry H. the city was laid waſte by the Scots, and the public records were burnt, which moſt probably, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the cuſtom of thoſe days, were depoſited in the archieves of the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics: conceiving this to be the fact, then we muſt admit of ſome conſiderable change in this ſacred edifice; for in 1292, we are told, an accidental fire conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the church, with half of the city, to the number of 1300 houſes, as far as the north gate. In the reign of King Edward III. it was rebuilt by contributions. The editor of Camden's words are, <q>Almoſt in the middle of the city, ſtands the cathedral church; <hi>the upper part,</hi> whereof (being newer) is a curious piece of workmanſhip, <hi>built by King Henry VIII.</hi> but the lower is much more ancient.— The lower weſt part is the parochial church, and as old as St. Cuthbert; or as Walter, who came in with the Conqueror, was a commander in his army, rebuilt the city, founded a priory, and turning religious, became, himſelf, the firſt prior of it. The chancel was built by contributions, about the year 1350, and the belfrey was raiſed, and the bells placed in it, at the charge of William de Strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, biſhop in the year 1401.</q> The expreſſion uſed by this learned editor, is ſo indefinite, that we own we are not able to determine, whether he meant to imply that King Henry VIII, built the preſent chancel. By a writer in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0873500300:20"/>Gentleman's Magazine 1745, p. 674, it is ſaid, <q>on the 14th Richard II. near 1500 houſes were deſtroyed, with the cathedral, and ſuburbs,</q> by an accidental fire; and he adds, this account is taken from the Magna Britannia Antiqua et Nova. If this account has any foundation, the laſt conflagration happened forty

Theſe contradictions and ambiguities, we are at preſent obliged to leave unſolved.</p>
               <p>The choir is 137 feet in length, and, with the ſide ailes, 71 feet broad: the croſs aile or tranſept is 28 feet broad, ſo that the length of the church, when entire, was exactly 300 feet within. The choir is of fine Gothic architecture, with light columns, remarkably beautiful. The ſtalls are garniſhed with taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle work; (the organ is placed at the croſs ſcreen, which contains but a narrow and low entrance, and is a great injury to this fine edifice.) By late repairs it is greatly embelliſhed, being wainſcotted with oak, from the ſtalls round the whole eaſt end of the choir, in a ſimple ſtile, after the old order. The open gates leading into the ſide ailes, are old and much broken, but ſhew excellent light Tracery work, finely ornamented. The biſhop's throne is not magnificent, but yet elegant and ſtately. The breadth of the choir and ailes being 71 feet, correſponds well with the height, which to the center of the ceiling is 75 feet. The roof was originally lined or vaulted with wood, painted and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with arms and devices of the ſeveral patrons and contributors to the work; with the arms of France and England, were thoſe of the Piercys, Lucys, Warrens, and Mowbrays. The old wood lining remains in the croſs aile, and ſhews what was the former figure, and the ornaments of the choir: but the outward roof and wood ceiling of the choir having gone greatly to decay, when repairs were made, in 1764 the ceiling was ſtuccoed, in the form of a groined vault, which is a great advantage to its appearance.
<note n="*" place="bottom">The whole expence amounted to 1300l. towards which, Dean Bolton contributed 50l.; Biſhop Lyttleton 100l. and the Counteſs Dowager Gower, 200l.; the reſt was made up by the Dean and Chapter.</note> The eaſt window is large, being 48 feet in height, and 30 in breadth, ornamented with fine pilaſters: but it has no caſt of ſolemnity, by means of a border of coloured glaſs thrown round it, of yellow, red, and green, which looks gaudy.

On the burial of any of the members of the choir, the corps is carried into that part of the church. The cathedral and pariſh church are both under one roof. It has a ſtately ſteeple with a ring of eight bells, which are rung on all public occaſions. The conſiſtory or ſpiritual court is kept in part of the church. In the abbey, contiguous to the church, and in which properly the church ſtands, are ſeveral venerable buildings, ſuch as the deanry, ſratery, head ſchool, cloiſters, porter's lodge, &amp;c.—L.</p>

               <p>The pillars of the choir are cluſtered, and in excellent proportion; the arches are pointed; in the inner mouldings of the capitals, are figures and flowers in pierced work, of light carving, and the inſide of the arches are prettily ornamented. Two galleries run above the ſide ailes, but with windows only in the upper: that in the eaſt end has a magnificent ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>When the choir was rebuilt in the reign of King Edward III. indulgences were iſſued, the common and moſt effectual claim of aſſiſtance; which were of forty days penance to ſuch laity, as ſhould, by money, materials, or labour, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to this pious work: and the biſhop's regiſter abounds with letters patent, and orders for the purpoſe.</p>

               <p>Prior Senhouſe, who occurs in 1507, repaired the ſquare tower within this priory; and on the beams of the middle room are inſcribed many ſentences, with a moral maxim often uſed by him, <hi>Loth to offend.</hi>

               <p>The door with its ornaments, on the ſouth ſide of the choir, near the biſhop's throne; and alſo the throne was the work of Prior Haythwaite, about the year 1480, his name having been on the backſide of it: and the oppoſite door with its ornaments, is ſuppoſed to have been erected by Prior Senhouſe, about the year 1500, by the ſentence inſcribed thereon, <hi>"Vulnera quinque dei ſint medicina mei,"</hi> which was that prior's common adage. The tabernacle work in the quire was done at the expence of Biſhop Strickland, who came to the ſee, A. D. 1400.</p>
               <p>There were two chapels, and two chantries, founded within this church; the chapel of St. Catharine was founded by John de Capella, a citizen of Carliſle, which he endowed with certain burgage houſes, ſome lands and rents. In 1366, there being an unjuſt detention of the rights of this chapel, Biſhop Appleby gave notice for reſtitution in ten days, under pain of excommunication by bell, book, and candle. This chapel was on the ſouth ſide of the church.</p>
               <p>The chapel of St. Alban in 1356, was on inquiry, found not to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, and thenceforth divine offices and ſepulture were prohibited to be longer performed therein: this appears by an entry in Biſhop Welton's regiſter. On the diſſolution, King Edward VI. granted the lands and tenements appertaining to this chantry, unto Thomas Dalſton and William Denton.</p>
               <p>Biſhop Whelpdale founded a chantry, and endowed it with 200l. for holy offices, for the ſouls of Sir Thomas Skelton, Knt. and Mr. John Glaſton.</p>
               <p>There was a chantry of the holy croſs, but who was the founder, and when it was endowed, is not known; King Edward VI. granted the lands and tenements thereto belonging, in Carliſle and Kirklinton, to Hen. Tanner and Tho. Bucher.

In taking down the old hangings and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the high altar to make the late repairs, at the north corner was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a braſs plate finely engraven, which had been put up to his memory.

King Henry I. founded a college of ſecular prieſts in the ſecond year of his reign, and made Athwald his confeſſor or chaplain, (prior of St. Botophs) firſt prior of Carliſle, dedicating the church to the honour of the Bleſſed Virgin Mary, and endowed them with the tithes of the churches then founded in the Foreſt of Englewood; but being hindred by the tumults and troubles of his time, he could not perfect all things before the 33d year of his reign, and then ſtrucken with grief for the loſs of his children, that were drowned coming from Normandy, by the counſel of the Prior Athelwold; and to appeaſe God for his ſins, as he thought, he erected a biſhop's ſee at Carliſle, and made the ſaid Athelwald, firſt biſhop thereof, whom the Archbiſhop of York named Thurſtan, did conſecrate in the year 1133: and in his ſtead, another chaplain of the ſaid King Henry, named Walter, was made the ſecond prior of that houſe, who, a little before his election, had taken upon him, by the king's licenſe, a religious habit, viz. of a regular canon there, which order of canons the king and biſhop Athelwold had placed in that houſe, baniſhing the ſecular prieſts immediately upon his conſecration. The ſaid Walter gave to the church of Carliſle for ever in pure alms, his lands in Lynſtock, Richardby, Croſby, Little Croſby, Walby, Brunſkeugh, Carleton, Little Carleton, and the wood; and the churches or rectories of St. Cuthbert in Carliſle and Staynwings, which the king had given him; and the ſame gift was confirmed unto them both by the king and biſhop Athelwold.</q>

At the firſt foundation of the church every citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen offered a piece of money, which was a coin of braſs then current, which they buried under the foundation of the church ſteeple there as was found to be true at the late re-edifying of St. Cuthbert's ſteeple, A.

               <p>Mr. Denton's account of the money found in rebuilding the ſleeple of St. Cuthbert's church, is rendered uncertain by ſome late diſcoveries; and it is moſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0873500300:31"/>probable it was a concealed treaſure, intended to be ſecured againſt the Danes, or ſome other ravagers: for when the foundations were making for the preſent new edifice, and the workmen had gone below the foundations of the old church, they diſcovered the remains of a ſtill more ancient erection, and took up ſeveral pieces of broken ſculpture; among the reſt the figure of a nun with her veil or hood, well cut and in good preſervation, which we ſaw in the garden of George Mounſey, Eſq. of Carliſle; ſo that it ſhould ſeem the old nunnery ſtood there.
<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <p>This ſculpture is now loſt.—In Mr. Mounſey's, and other gardens adjoining, many foundations of houſes, fragments of pottery, quantities of oak-wood, human bones, &amp;c. have been dug up at various times. This ground is upon the eaſt ſide of Engliſh ſtreet, and called the Grey-Friars; and up the weſt ſide, adjoining the walls, from St. Cuthbert's church to the jail, is called the Black-Friars; and ſimilar things have been dug up here alſo: a few years ago, in making a drain from a houſe here towards the walls, the top of an arch was diſcerned; ſome of the ſtones being removed, we diſcovered a ſpacious arched room, one ſide of which reſted upon the walls, in height 15 feet, in breadth 12 feet, and in length about 30 feet; the end was narrower and lower, and ſuppoſed to have been connected with other ſimilar rooms, but the partitions built up. There were four funnels went upright to the foot-path of the walls, but covered at the top with ſlags, and iron grates in the funnels. On the oppoſite ſide, between two of the arches, a horizontal funnel, about two feet wide and three feet high, went towards the city: this was ſearched a conſiderable way, till the perſon was entangled with rubbiſh which choaked it up: beneath this paſſage, the floor was flagged and walled in about 18 inches high on each ſide, and a conduit went through the city walls on the oppoſite ſide of the vault; this was opened by removing the earth on the out ſide, about four feet deep, and let out a great quantity of water which was lodged in the vault. Proceeding to remove the wet rubbiſh which was collected, the workmen were interrupted by the gunner of the caſtle, who aſſumed a higher power than Mr. Mead, the ſtore keeper, at whoſe inſtance the ſearch was making; and the place was immediately ſhut up and never ſince opened.

Notwithſtanding Denton's account, we are convinced there was a ſucceſſion of thirty priors after Athelwald, before the time of the diſſolution. Athelwald afterwards being made biſhop of this dioceſe, was ſucceeded in the priory by Walter, another chaplain of the kings', who had taken upon him the regular habit; and being a rigorous diſciplinarian, he baniſhed all

               <p>was inſtituted and founded by King Henry I. in the year 1133, two and thirty years after the foundation of the priory. By the gift of Egfrid, Carliſle became
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0873500300:36"/>a member of the ſee of Lindisfarne, and followed the tranſlation of that biſhoprick to Cheſter, and finally to Durham. The cauſe alledged for diſmembering Carliſle, and conſtituting there a ſeparate ſee, was on account of the diſtance from Durham,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0873500300:37"/>then the ſeat of the epiſcopacy, and the conſequential delays of epiſcopal duties there. According to Camden, the monks of Durham looked upon this act of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0873500300:38"/>ſovereign, as a grievous infringement of their ancient rights and privileges; but from the abject diſpoſition of mind, peculiar to that age, they avoided pointing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0873500300:39"/>the accuſation where it was due, and alledged that <q>when Ralph, biſhop of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was baniſhed, and the church had none to protect it, certain biſhops joined

                  <p>IN the diſtant age in which the firſt Biſhop of Carliſle aroſe, little can be gathered of the virtues of memorable actions of men, though even thus eminent: this obſcurity is greateſt in a country which was almoſt a conſtant ſcene of military exploits, depredations, and bloodſhed. Carliſle, though a chief barrier againſt the Scots, ſuffered many changes of fortune, and the life of its biſhop was frequently diſturbed and full of trouble. From ſuch cauſes, there is but little hiſtoric matter handed down to us, perſonally rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0873500300:43"/>to this prelate, and ſeveral of his immediate ſucceſſors. We find him indeed buſy in one eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal matter, in which he was immediately adverſary to the will of his ſovereign. He was one of the electors of Henry Murdac, abbot of Fountanis to be archbiſhop of York. The king's diſpleaſure was ſuch at this tranſaction, that he denounced vengeance againſt all thoſe who were concerned in it: but ſuch was this prelate's contempt of the ſovereign's menaces and ſelf-confidence, that he received Murdac as his metropolitan, when he came to viſit David King of Scotland, then reſident in this city.

He remained biſhop of Carliſle to the time of his death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, A. D. 1186. From the long continued vacancy of the ſee, it appears evidently, that it was in a ſad unſettled ſtate, and full of diſcord and troubles, as well as meanly revenued; for, by the regiſter of Wetheral, it is ſhewn that King Henry II. being preſent at Carliſle, tendered the biſhoprick to Paulinus de Leedes, and (as ſuch was even an early influence in the eccleſiaſtical affairs) offered to augment the income with 300 marks out of the churches of Bambrough and Scarbrough, with the chapel of Tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, and two manors adjacent to Carliſle: but even with ſuch augmentations Paulinus refuſed it.

In 1203, the Pope intermeddled with the income of the ſee, granting it to the archbiſhop of Regula, who was obliged to abandon his own, and was deſtitute of ſupport. This act of the papal authority was confirmed by the king. The continued vacancy let in a flood of enormities among the religious here. The canons publickly announced their contempt of the papal authority, and the cenſures of his legate: in defiance of all the interdicts and ſentences denounced to the contrary, they perſiſted in celebrating divine ſervices, and all holy offices of the ſacraments: but their arrogance and impropieties did not ceaſe there; they ſwore fealty to the king of Scots, an avowed enemy to the crown of England, and one in open oppoſition to the authority of the holy ſee. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe licentious acts, they ſet up an interdicted and excommunicated clerk for their biſhop, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of their lawful ſovereign, and the pope's legate; and ſeizing the revenues of the biſhoprick, applied them according to their own will. Enormities like theſe were to be corrected with the ſevereſt meaſures. The council of King Henry III. applied to Pope Honorius III. totally to remove theſe offenſive canons, and place prebends in their room; to augment the revenues of the ſee, which were ſo ſmall that no able and loyal perſon would accept of the biſhoprick, and to diſplace the perſon who had
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0873500300:44"/>been thus obtruded, to the epiſcopacy.

But Walter held this diſtinguiſhed office but a very ſhort time, though his charter contained an appointment for life; he was diſcharged in a diſgraceful manner without any cauſe aſſigned; his grants, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his office, were ordered to be cancelled, and he was fined 100l the king appointing Peter de Rival his ſucceſſor; and commanded S. de Segrave, his juſticiar, to put him in poſſeſſion of the treaſury, in caſe Walter refuſed to deliver the keys, and all things belonging thereto, by inventory and view, and teſtimony of true men.

Walter would have repaired to Rome for redreſs, but having got on board a veſſel at Dover, he was arreſted by the officers of the crown, and brought on ſhore. The Biſhop of London was a ſpectator of this outrage, and immediately pronounced a ſentence of excommunication againſt thoſe concerned in this arreſt: and ſo earneſtly did he engage in this buſineſs, that he haſted to Hereford where the king held his court, and with the aſſiſtance of ſeveral biſhops there preſent, renewed his ſentence.

                        <p>"The Cornu Eburneum they have yet in the cathedral of Carliſle, a ſymbol, very probably, of ſome of King Henry I's grants to the priory; but in none of thoſe grants, of which any copy is now extant, do thoſe tythes appear. The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of inveſtiture with a horn, or other like ſymbol, is very ancient, and was in uſe before there were any written charters. We read of Ulf a Daniſh prince, who gave all his lands to the church of York, and the form of the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was this; he brought the horn out of which he uſually drank, and before the high altar, kneeling devoutly, drank the wine, and by that ceremony enfeoſſed the church with all his lands and revenues.</p>
                        <p>King Canute, another Dane, gave lands at Puſey in Berkſhire, to the family of that name there, with a horn ſolemnly delivered as a confirmation of the grant; which horn, it is ſaid, is ſtill there to be ſeen.</p>
                        <p>So King Edward the confeſſor, granted to Nigel the huntſman, an hide of land, called Derehide; and a wood, called Halewood, with the cuſtody of the foreſt of Bernewood, to hold of the king, to him and his heirs, by one horn, which is the charter of the ſaid foreſt.</p>
                        <p>So that, not the Danes only, but the Engliſh Saxons alſo, were acquainted with this ancient cuſtom. Thus Ingulphus, abbot of Crowland, who lived in the time of William the Conqueror, acquaints us that it continued down to his time. He tells us that many eſtates were granted by word only, without writing, as by delivery of a ſword, an helmet, a horn or cup, or ſuch like; but this mode, he ſays, in after times was changed.</p>
                        <p>Ulf's horn at York, when the reformation began in King Edward the VI's. time, was ſwept away amongſt other coſtly ornaments, and ſold to a goldſmith, who took away from it the tippings of gold wherewith it was adorned, and the gold chain which was affixed to it. fAfter which time the horn itſelf, out in ivory, of an Octagon form, came into the hands of General Fairfax; who being a lover of antiquities, preſerved it during the confuſions of the civil wars; whoſe memory is deſervedly honoured for other generous actions of this nature; ſuch as allowing Mr. Dodſworth, the antiquarian, a yearly ſalary to preſerve the inſcriptions in churches, the giving his valuable manuſcripts to the univerſity of Oxford, and his preſerving the public library there, as he did the cathedral at York from being ſpoiled and defaced after the ſurrender of the city. And he dying in 1671, this horn came into the poſſeſſion of his next kinſman, Lord Fairfax, who ornamented it anew, and reſtored it to its ancient repoſitory, where it now remains a noble monument of modern as well as ancient piety.—ARCUAEOLOGIA, 168.</p>
                     </note> but the grants given in evidence not extending to ſuch tythes, either expreſsly or by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, the right was adjudged to the king, and he afterwards granted the ſame to the prior and convent, as before-mentioned.</p>

The hiſtory of that particular aera is not wanted to ſhew the reader from what principles he ſtood an advocate in parliament for the depoſed king: his attachment was ſo warm, and his temper ſo regardleſs of every thing but truth, that in the firſt ſeſſions under King Henry IV. he pronounced the ſevereſt condemnations on the meaſures and the men, by which the revolution had been effected; and even treated the reigning prince with that derogation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that he was committed for high treaſon, and deprived of his biſhoprick.

                  <p>ROBERT ALDRIDGE ſucceeded to the ſee, A. D. 1537. As he lived in a buſy age, and was preſent to many great changes in church and ſtate, one ſhould expect from a man of ſo great a character, as to his learning, one whom Eraſmus called in his early years, "blanda eloquentiae Juvenis," a poet and ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of more than ordinary note, that he would have been a ſhining figure in the multiform buſineſs of this part of Henry's reign: but we may judge from his conſtantly holding the appointments he had, that he temporized with the vereing meaſures of the prince; and like the notorious, though perhaps, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary character of the vicar of Bray, ſtill keeping the ſaddle, let the object of the purſuit be what it might. The ſervility that ſtrikes the idea, when one conceives ſuch a character, in the time of this monarch, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſpires averſion. It may be a harſh ſentence, but it proceeds from a fact, that produces large and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inferences. Let us attend to his progreſs in life. Buckinghamſhire was the place of his birth, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0873500300:53"/>he received his education at Eaton, till the year 1507, when he was appointed a ſcholar of King's col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, Cambridge. He was once proctor of that univerſity; and from thence he became maſter, fellow, and provoſt of Eaton. About the year 1529, he was made bachelor of divinity at Oxford, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year took up his doctor's degree. Soon after, he was appointed archdeacon of Colcheſter; and in the year 1537, was inſtalled a canon at Windſor, and made regiſter of the order of the garter. He was an oppoſer of Cranmer, and adhered to the Romiſh profeſſion of faith; indeed, in the work called the Biſhop's Book, containing the godly and pious inſtitution of a chriſtian, it is ſaid he joined with that archbiſhop; but touching the doctrine of the ſeven ſacraments, his opinion was immediately oppoſite: and he promoted the act of 31ſt King Henry VIII. touching the ſix articles, contrary to every effort of Cranmer.—He departed this life, 1555, and was ſucceeded by</p>

                  <p>OWEN OGLETHORP; who, by the inconſiſtencies in his public actions, ſeems to have been a very weak man. He received the temporalties of this biſhoprick in the month of October, in the year 1556; but the pope's confirmatory bull did not arrive till the month of January following. He was born at a ſmall village, near Tadcaſter, in the county of York, of inferior parents, and had his education in Magdalene College, Oxford. In the year 1531, he was proctor of the univerſity, and ſoon after was entered bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of divinity. In the year 1535, he was choſen preſident of the college; and in 1551, had the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed office of vice chancellor. He was made a canon, and ſoon after dean, of the royal chapel at Windſor; and in the firſt year of Queen Mary's reign, he was appointed ſecretary to the order of the garter: this was a year of great honour to him, for in it he held the preſidency of Magdalene College, the rectories of Newington and Haſſely, in Oxfordſhire; together with the deanry of Windſor. In 1554, he was one of the appointed diſputants in the controverſy with Cranmer, Latimer, and Rydley; and ſhewed himſelf a moſt inveterate adverſary to the principles of reformation, and even to that humane rule, toleration. In 1558, we ſee him acting in the inconſiſtent character I intimated; for, during the vacancy of the ſee of Canterbury, when all the biſhops had refuſed to officiate in the coronation of Queen Elizabeth: he only, the loweſt of the tribe, the bittereſt in the meaſures againſt reformiſts, and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the proteſtant church; he only could be found to place the crown on the head of that illuſtrious princeſs: the lords of the council, willing that the ceremony ſhould have every outward dignity, ſent for all the pontifical robes, and enſigns of high office, uſed by the archbiſhop on that ſolemn occaſion, that our prelate might be duely habited for the occaſion. It is not to be reconciled, how Oglethorpe could be influenced to this office; the character of the princeſs, and her ſentiments in religious matter, were no ſecrets; and the biſhop's faith and ſentiments were publicly avouched: the inconſiſtency is not to be reconciled, but by the diſcovery of thoſe influences and private ſprings of the ſtate, which are long ſince locked up in the impenetrable regions of oblivion. How muſt he have been ſhocked and confounded, whilſt the ceremony was performing, by the command of the queen not to elevate the conſecrated hoſt, in the celebration of maſs, uſual in this ſolemnity, "<hi>becauſe ſhe liked it not.</hi> Wood, with a voice of commiſeration, would palliate the error with his pity: <q>For the fact, when he ſaw the iſſue of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and both himſelf and the whole tribe of his ſecret order deprived, the churches holy laws, and faith againſt the conditions of her conſecration, and acception into that royal office violated, he fore repented him all the days of his life, which were, for that ſpecial cauſe, both ſhort and weariſome.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt parliament he gave his vote againſt the bills for reſtitution of firſt fruits, for reſtoring the ſupremacy, exchange of biſhops lands, and uniformity of the common prayer. He would willingly, by his adherence to his old partizans, have recovered a reputation he had loſt, by being a tool to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing party; and, by his unſteadineſs, he dropt to the ground between the two. The council fined him 250l. for non-attendance at Sewel's challenge in diſputation, A. D. 1559, as her majeſty had commanded; and ſhortly after he was deprived of his biſhoprick, worth 268l.</p>
                  <p>His death was ſudden, but the cauſe uncertain; the popular report was, that it happened in an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy. He was privately buried at St. Dunſtan's in the weſt. By his will, he ordered the foundation of a ſchool and hoſpital, at Tadcaſter, with an ample endowment.</p>

                  <p>JOHN BEST who ſucceeded to the biſhoprick, was a man of a different caſt, of the true reformiſts principles; and one who had lived obſcurely during the reign of Quen Mary, to conceal himſelf from
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0873500300:54"/>the rage and intemperate zeal that diſtinguiſhed that ſhort, but unhappy period. He was born in the northern parts of Yorkſhire, of parents of a low ſtation, and had his education in the univerſity of Oxford. He was conſecrated, A. D. 1560, when he was 48 years of age. The unſettled and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent eſtate of the north was ſuch, that he was obliged to have a commiſſion to arm himſelf and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants within his biſhoprick, againſt the tumultuous and enraged populace. He was one of thoſe who was created doctor in divinity by Doctor Humphreys, the queen's profeſſor at Oxford, at a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention in London; and he ſubſcribed the Saxon homilies.

                  <p>RICHARD BARNES was his ſucceſſor. From this period of time, the buſineſs and importance of biſhops in ſecular affairs declined: in their ſpiritual powers they were ſo reduced, that only within their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive biſhopricks, they held the authorities conſiſtent with the ancient rules of the common law, without the ſuperlative aid of the ſee of Rome; ſo that, from this aera the hiſtory of our prelates becomes little more than perſonal. Biſhop Barnes was born in the county of Lancaſter, and educated in Brazen Noſe College, Oxford, where he took a degree of maſter of arts, and was elected a fellow. He had a degree of bachelor of divinity at Cambridge, was chancellor of the cathedral at York, and reſidentiary canon there for the prebendary of Loughton. In 1567, he was eonſecrated ſuffragan biſhop of Nottingham; and in 1570, was conſecrated biſhop of Carliſle.

From the ruins of the ancient church, aroſe innumerable ſectaries; the great ſtock was hewn down, and from the roots iſſued a multitude of ungrafted ſhoots, bearing unprofitable fruit; among others, the Arminian principles were introduced: this biſhop even taught them on the ſolemn feſtival of Chriſtmas, in the chapel-royal, in the hearing of his ſovereign, and ſoon after was tranſlated to the ſee of Norwich: ſo formidable was the growth of innovations in religion, and arminianiſm in particular, that they occaſioned a parliamentary inquiry. From his fervour againſt the papiſts, he was employed by the king, as a ſpy upon the conduct of the counteſs of Denbeigh, who was much inclined to liſten to the rules of that faith; to reward him for his aſſiduity in that duty, he firſt was made dean of Carliſle, and then appointed to the biſhoprick.

He held the revenues of this biſhoprick, in commendam, by the grant of King Charles I. as a compenſation for his great ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in his archbiſhoprick of Armagh in Ireland, by the commotions in that kingdom. He was, by birth, an Iriſhman, and had his education in the univerſity of Dublin. He was promoted to the biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Meath in 1620, and four years afterwards was advanced to the archbiſhoprick. With difficulty, and a parſimonious hand, he ſubſiſted on the revenues of our ſee, diminiſhed and exhauſted as they were by the armies of England and Scotland, alternately quartering in this county; at length the ſeizure which was made by parliament on all the lands of biſhops, brought him to great diſtreſs. In conſideration of his eminent character, his learning and virtuous zeal, he had a penſion of 400l. a-year granted to him, by parliamentary order, but it was paid very ill, inſomuch that he never received it above once or twice.</p>

Cromwell gave-directions that the biſhop's library ſhould not be ſold without his conſent; but it was plundered of many of the valuable manuſcripts; the ſoldiers took many choice books at a price of their own making, and in the confuſion which then diſtracted the ſtate, the collection was mutilated and greatly prejudiced.

                  <p>RICHARD STERN was elected, a perſon of little note by birth. He had his education in Cambridge, was maſter of Jeſus College, and took the degree of doctor in divinity. He was domeſtic chaplain to archbiſhop Laud, and attended on the ſcaffold at his execution. He was a priſoner in the tower with ſeveral others, upon a complaint made by Cromwell, who was then one of the burgeſſes of Cambridge, that they had conveyed the college plate for the king's relief at York: from this cauſe he was diſpoſſeſſed of his ſeveral appointments, and lived in obſcurity till the reſtoration. In 1664 he was tranſlated to York, and died there in 1683. The character given of him by biſhop Burnet, we think ought to receive great credit from the known integrity of the writer; and he intimates that <q>
                        <hi>he was a ſour, ill-tempered man, and was chiefly ſtudious of meaſures to enrich his family: he was particularly attached to the court and ſervile in adopting the meaſures then moved in; that he was zealous in the affairs of the duke of York, and was ſtrongly ſuſpected of popery.</hi>
                     </q> Nicholſon and Burn have attempted to reſcue his character by the publication of a letter which they ſay was written from York to his ſucceſſor at Carliſle; but is anonymous, and if it is from the hand of any perſon of note, it was as eaſy to ſubſcribe the name, to give it weight and authority, as to publiſh the ſentences to give him a ſuperficial character. <q>He was greatly reſpected, and generally lamented. All the clergy commemorate his ſweet condeſcenſions, his free communications, faithful counſels, exemplary temperance, chearful hoſpitality, and bountiful charity</q>; ſuch is this epiſtolary panegyric; and which is only equalled by his monumental inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Biſhop Burnet muſt have been baſely inveterate or deceived.

                  <p>EDWARD RAINBOW came to the ſee in 1664. He was born at Bilton in the county of Lincoln, 1608, being the ſon of the pariſh prieſt there. He was educated at Weſtminſter ſchool, and was a ſtudent in Corpus Chriſti College Oxford. He obtained a fellowſhip in Magdalen College Cambridge, where he was tutor to ſeveral eminent pupils, among whom were the ſons of lords, Suffolk and Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court. In the year 1642, he was elected maſter of Magdalen, and took his degree of doctor of divinity: but he was ſoon after deprived of his maſterſhip for refuſing to ſign a proteſtation againſt the king. In 1652, he obtained the living of Cheſterfield in Eſſex; and in 1659, the Earl of Warwick preſented him to the valuable living of Benefield, in the county of Northampton. He was reſtored to his maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and made dean of Peterborough ſoon after K.

                  <p>THOMAS SMITH born at Whitewall, in Weſtmorland. He had his education at Appleby free ſchool, and was a ſtudent in Queen's College Oxford. He was a man, though deeply read in the learning of his age, of conſummate modeſty, and humble expectations. In the early part of life, in the univerſity he had the degree of maſter of arts and held a fellowſhip. He was a well reputed tutor, and had many eminent pupils. Whilſt the king was reſident at Oxford, he was appointed preacher at Chriſt-church; and at St. Mary's, he preached before the Parliament. In the ſucceeding confuſions in church and ſtate, he retired to the north and lived in great privacy. On the reſtoration he was created bachelor of divinity, and ſoon after, by diploma, had a doctor's degree given him by the univerſity of Oxford.</p>
                  <p>He was one of thoſe who were fortunate enough to be in the ſovereign's remembrance, for (multitudes were neglected) and was made one of his chaplains in ordinary: in November, 1660, he was nominated to a prebend in this church. A prebend in the cathedral of Durham, in a few months, was offered to him by biſhop Coſins, and there he had conceived his preferments in the church were to reſt; for at a conſiderable expence he repaired the houſe in the college at Durham, in a manner conſiſtent with an idea that it would be the place of his reſidence for life.</p>
                  <p>In 1671, he was appointed dean of Carliſle, and in 1684, on the recommendation of K. Charles, he was elected to this ſee. He died at Roſe-Caſtle, on the 12th of April, 1702, and was buried in this cathedral.

                  <p>WILLIAM NICHOLSON, his ſucceſſor, was born at Orton near Carliſle, being the ſon of the rector of that pariſh. He was a ſtudent in Queen's college Oxford, where in 1678, having taken the degree of maſter of arts, he was elected to a fellowſhip. In 1681, he was made a prebendary of this church by biſhop Rainbow, and had the vicarage of Torpenhow: and in the year following he was made arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of Carliſle. In the year 1702, he was conſecrated, at Lambeth, biſhop of this ſee; a promotion ſaid to be obtained by the intereſt of the Muſgraves of Edenhall: an aſſertion injurious to his great learning, his high merit, and connections in life, from whence his promotion was derived.</p>
                  <p>He found ſome difficulties from the imperfection of the inſtruments, in granting inſtitution to doctor Francis Atterbury, to the deanry of Carliſle; which by the queen's ſpecial command were obviated: but it is probable this imbittered their minds againſt each other, for on the biſhop's interpoſition as viſitor under the ſtatute of K. Henry VIII, for appeaſing certain conteſts which had ariſen between the dean and the chapter; at the dean's inſtigation, doctor Todd proteſted againſt his right of viſitation, inſiſting on the invalidity of that ſtatute, and that in the crown only was veſted that privilege:

Henry VIII. In the year 1715, he was made Lord Almoner; in 1718, was tranſlated to Londonderry, in Ireland, and died ſuddenly, 1726, before his removal to the archbiſhoprick of Caſhell, for which tranſlation the inſtruments were made out.</p>
                  <p>He was a celebrated writer, in his works diſcovering an excellent and almoſt univerſal genius. In the year 1678, the ſecretary of ſtate, Sir Joſeph Williamſon, ſent him to Leipſic to acquire a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Dutch and other continental languages. At the inſtance of the profeſſor there, he tranſlated out of the Engliſh into Latin, Hook's Eſſay on the Motion of the Earth from the Sun's Parallax. In the year 1680, he publiſhed the three firſt volumes of the Engliſh Atlas, comprehending an account of Poland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Germany. In the year 1685, he wrote two ſhort accounts of the inſcriptions on the Bewcaſtle monument, and font at Bridekirk in this county; publiſhed in the philoſophical tranſactions. In 1696 he publiſhed the firſt part of his Engliſh hiſtorical library, the ſecond part appearing the next year; and in 1699 it was completed in the third part. In 1702 he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0873500300:59"/>publiſhed one for Scotland, and in 1724 one alſo for Ireland. In 1705 he publiſhed the Border Laws. In 1713 he wrote a preface to doctor Chamberlain's book on the Lord's prayer. In 1717 were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in octavo, a collection of papers which had appeared in the Daily Courant, and other periodical prints. In 1719 he wrote a preface to the third edition of doctor Wilkin's Leges Anglo-Saxonicae. He was the author of many ſermons which appeared from the preſs, and left ſeveral manuſcripts to the dean and chapter of Carliſle, touching this dioceſe.

He had the rectory of Alve church, Worceſterſhire, in 1742. He was one of the chaplains in ordinary to King George II. and in the year 1748, he was made dean of Exeter. He enioyed this biſhoprick but ſix years, dying A. D. 1768, at his houſe in London.—He was interred at Hagley.

                  <p>EDMUND LAW, D. D. ſucceeded to the ſee in 1768.—He was born in the pariſh of Cartmel in Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, in the year 1703. His father, who was a clergyman, held a ſmall chapel in that neighbourhood; but the family had been ſituated at Aſkham, in the county of Weſtmorland. He was educated for ſome time at Cartmel ſchool, afterwards at the free grammar-ſchool at Kendal; from which he went, very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the learning of grammar ſchools, to St. John's College in Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>Soon after taking his firſt degree, he was elected fellow of Chriſt's College in that univerſity. During his reſidence in which college, he became known to the public by a tranſlation of Archbiſhop King's Eſſay upon the Origin of Evil, with copious notes; in which many metaphyſical ſubjects, curious and intereſting in their own nature, are treated of with great ingenuity, learning, and novelty. To this work was prefixed, under the name of a Preliminary Diſſertation, a very valuable piece, written by the Rev. Mr. Gay of Sidney College. Our biſhop always ſpoke of this gentleman in terms of the greateſt reſpect. In the Bible, and in the writings of Mr. Locke, no man, he uſed to ſay, was ſo well verſed.</p>
                  <p>He alſo, whilſt at Chriſt-College, undertook and went through a very laborious part, in preparing for the preſs, an edition of Stephen's Theſaurus. His acquaintance, during his firſt reſidence in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, was principally with Dr. Waterland, the learned maſter of Magdalen College; Dr. Jortin, a name known to every ſcholar; and Dr. Taylor, the editor of Demoſthenes.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1737, he was preſented by the univerſity to the living of Grayſtock, in the county of Cumberland, a rectory of about 300l. a year. The advowſon of this benefice belonged to the family of Howards of Grayſtock, but devolved to the univerſity for this turn, by virtue of an act of parliament, which transfers to theſe two bodies the nomination to ſuch benefices as appertain, at the time of the vacancy, to the patronage of a Roman Catholic. The right, however, of the univerſity was conteſted; and it was not till after a law-ſuit of two years continuance, that Mr. Law was ſettled in his living. Soon after this, he married Mary, the daughter of John Chriſtian, Eſq. of Unerigg, in the county of Cumberland; a lady, whoſe character is remembered with tenderneſs and eſteem by all who knew her.</p>
                  <p>In 1743, he was promoted by Sir George Fleming, biſhop of Carliſle, to the archdeaconry of that dioceſe; and in 1746, went from Grayſtock to reſide at Salkeld, a pleaſant village upon the banks of the river Eden, the rectory of which is annexed to the archdeaconry. Mr. Law was not one of thoſe who loſe and forget themſelves in the country. During his reſidence at Salkeld, he publiſhed Conſiderations on the Theory of Religion: to which were ſubjoined, Reflections on the Life and Character of Chriſt; and an appendix concerning the uſe of the words Soul and Spirit in holy Scripture, and the ſtate of the dead there deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Keene held at this time, with the biſhoprick of Cheſter, the maſterſhip of Peterhouſe in Cambridge. Deſiring to leave the univerſity, he procured Dr. Law to be elected to ſucceed him in that ſtation. This took place in the year 1756; in which year Dr. Law reſigned his archdeaconry in favour of Mr. Eyre, a brother-in-law of Dr. Keene. Two years before this, he had proceeded to his degree of doctor in divinity; in his public exerciſe for which, he defended the doctrine of what is uſually called the "ſleep of the ſoul."</p>
                  <p>About the year 1760, he was appointed head librarian of the univerſity; a ſituation which, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an eaſy and quick acceſs to books, was peculiarly agreeable to his taſte and habits. Some time
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0873500300:61"/>after this, he was alſo appointed caſuiſtical profeſſor. In the year 1762, he ſuffered an irreparable loſs by the death of his wife; a loſs in itſelf every way afflicting, and rendered more ſo by the ſituation of his family, which then conſiſted of eleven children, many of them very young. Some years afterwards, he received ſeveral preferments, which were rather honourable expreſſions of regard from his friends, than of much advantage to his fortune.</p>
                  <p>By Dr. Cornwallis, then biſhop of Litchfield, afterwards archbiſhop of Canterbury, who had been his pupil at Chriſt College, he was appointed to the archdeaconry of Staffordſhire, and to a prebend in the church of Litchfield. By his old acquaintance, Dr. Green, biſhop of Lincoln, he was made a prebendary of that church. But in the year 1767, by the intervention of the duke of Newcaſtle, to whoſe intereſt, in the memorable conteſt for the high ſtewardſhip of the univerſity, he had adhered in oppoſition to ſome temptations, he obtained a ſtall in the church of Durham. The year after this, the duke of Grafton, who had a ſhort time before been elected chancellor of the univerſity, recommended the maſter of Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to his majeſty for the biſhoprick of Carliſle. This recommendation was made, not only without ſolicitation on his part or that of his friends, but without his knowledge, until the duke's intention in his favour was ſignified to him by the archbiſhop.</p>
                  <p>In or about the year 1777, our biſhop gave to the public a handſome edition, in three volumes quarto, of the Works of Mr. Locke, with a Life of the Author, and a preface. Mr. Locke's writings and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he held in the higheſt eſteem, and ſeems to have drawn from them many of his own principles: he was a diſciple of that ſchool. About the ſame time he publiſhed a tract, which engaged ſome atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the controverſy concerning ſubſcription; and he publiſhed new editions of his two principal works, with conſiderable additions, and ſome alterations. Beſides the works already mentioned, he publiſhed, in 1734, or 1735, a very ingenious <hi>Inquiry into the Ideas of Space, Time,</hi> &amp;c. in which he combats the opinions of Dr. Clarke and his adherents on theſe ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Law held the ſee of Carliſle almoſt nineteen years; during which time he twice, only, omitted ſpending the ſummer months in his dioceſe at the biſhop's reſidence at Roſe Caſtle; a ſituation with which he was much pleaſed, not only on account of the natural beauty of the place, but becauſe it reſtored him to the country, in which he had ſpent the beſt part of his life. In the year 1787, he paid this viſit in a ſtate of great weakneſs and exhauſtion; and died at Roſe about a month after his arrival there, on the 14th day of Auguſt, and in the 84th year of his age.</p>
                  <p>The life of Dr. Law was a life of inceſſant reading, and thought, almoſt entirely directed to meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical and religious inquires; but the tenet by which his name and writings are principally diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, is "that Jeſus Chriſt, at his ſecond coming, will, by an act of his power, reſtore to life and conſciouſneſs the dead of the human ſpecies, who, by their own nature, and without this interpoſition, would remain in the ſtate of inſenſibility, to which the death brought upon mankind by the ſin of Adam had reduced them." He interpreted literally that ſaying of St. Paul, 1 Cor. XV. 21. <q>As by man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead.</q> This opinion had no other effect upon his own mind than to increaſe his reverence for Chriſtianity, and for its divine Founder. He retained it, as he did his other ſpeculative opinions, without laying, as many are wont to do, an extravagant ſtreſs upon their importance, and without pretending to more certainty than the ſubject allowed of. No man formed his own concluſions with more freedom, or treated thoſe of others with greater candour and equity. He never quarrelled with any perſon for differing from him, or conſidered that difference as a ſufficient reaſon for queſtioning any man's ſincerity, or judging meanly of his underſtanding. He was zealouſly attached to religious liberty, becauſe he thought that it leads to truth; yet from his heart he loved peace. But he did not perceive any repugnancy in theſe two things. There was nothing in his elevation to his biſhoprick which he ſpoke of with more pleaſure, than its being a proof that decent freedom of inquiry was not diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of great ſoftneſs of manners, and of the mildeſt and moſt tranquil diſpoſition. His voice was never raiſed above its ordinary pitch. His countenance ſeemed never to have been ruffled; it preſerved the ſame kind and compoſed aſpect, truly indicating the calmneſs and benignity of his temper. He had an utter diſlike of large and mixed companies. Next to his books his chief ſatisfaction was in the ſerious converſation of a literary companion, or in the company of a few friends. In this ſort of ſociety he would open his mind with great unreſervedneſs, and with a peculiar turn and ſprightlineſs of expreſſion. His perſon was low, but well formed; his complexion fair and delicate. Except occaſional interruptions by the gout, he had for the greateſt part of his life enjoyed good health; and when not confined by that diſtemper, was full of motion and activity. About nine years before his death, he was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0873500300:62"/>greatly enfeebled by a ſevere attack of the gout in his ſtomach; and a ſhort time after that, loſt the uſe of one of his legs. Notwithſtanding his fondneſs for exerciſe, he reſigned himſelf to this change, not only without complaint, but without any ſenſible diminution of his chearfulneſs and good humour. His fault (for we are not writing a panegyric) was the general fault of retired and ſtudious characters, too great a degree of inaction and facility in his public ſtation. The modeſty, or rather baſhfulneſs of his nature, together with an extreme unwillingneſs to give pain, rendered him ſometimes leſs firm and efficient in the adminiſtration of authority than was requiſite. But it is the condition of human mortality. There is an oppoſition between ſome virtues which ſeldom permits them to ſubſiſt together in perfection

Mr. William Loſh, ſenior, <hi>Taberder</hi> of Queen's College Oxford, and chaplain to her grace the ducheſs of Gordon. He was a gentleman of the brighteſt parts, and had made great advances in all the branches of polite and ſolid learning that could well be expected at his years. He was bleſt with ſo ſweet and humane a diſpoſition, that the common accidents of life gave him no laſting diſquiet, nor interrupted that univerſal benevolence, which, with him, diffuſed itſelf in a proportionable ſcale of duty from the whole body of mankind to the meaneſt ſtranger. This benign diſpoſition made him the conſtant advocate of the rights and priviledges of the human ſpecies, in oppoſition to tyranny and oppreſſion; theſe he maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon all occaſions, with a warmth and ſpirit which well became a Britiſh ſubject. He had many good qualities, but was eminent for piety; and as he drew from religion an unbroken peace of mind, a ſolid ſatisfaction, and an unſurmountable courage; in return, he cultivated religion in the province aſſigned to him with indefatigable induſtry, and a zeal undaunted, but ſuch as was founded on ſcripture, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by reaſon.</p>

                     <p>"He died in the very ſpring of his age, and but in the bloſſom of his virtues, yet he diſcovered enough to make it evident, that had he lived to ſhew himſelf in the riſing ſtages of life, his great and uncommon endowments would have rendered him dear to the polite, the learned, and the religious; and his death would have been as juſtly regretted by the public, as it is at preſent by thoſe who had the happineſs of knowing him."</p>

               <p>
                  <q>Botchardby, villa Bochardi, was the inheritance of one Bocharda Fleming, one of thoſe that firſt peopled Carliſle; he had a grange there for the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his houſe at Carliſle; and when the Flemings went to Angleſea in Wales, he left that patrimony to Guy the foreſter, with his daughter Iſold. To this Guy the hunter, King Henry I. confirmed Bochardby, to hold the ſame by cornage, paying yearly 6s. 2d. cornage ſilver to the king. It is gildable and vicontiel, and gives aid with Combquinton to the ſheriff, yearly 4s. 4d. torn ſilver. It lineally deſcended in the iſſue male unto William, the ſon of Otho or Odan, ſon of Ralph, ſon of Guido the hunter, de Bochardby. This William lived in the time of King John, and held then the manor of him. Then Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de Bochardby, and Adam de Bochardby, deſcended of younger brothers, held parts of the ſame. In the 12th year of King Henry III. Radulph, the ſon of William de Bochardby entered to the ſeigniory; his ſiſters, Alice, Pavy, and Agnes, were his heirs: Alice and Agnes gave their parts to Jacoline le Blond of Carliſle, and Pavy her part to Adam Leges her ſon, and to William, ſon of Irco. The five daughters of Jacoline did inherit, viz. Sunimote, Johan, Matild, Juhan, and Marriotte.—Bochard.—Guido Venator, and I ſold his wife.—Ralph, ſon of Guy.—Odo, ſon of Ralph.—William, ſon of Odo.—Ralph, ſon of William.— Walter.—Adam.—Robert Parving.—Adam Parving, 3d Richard II.—Robert Parving.—William Stapleton.—William Stapleton.—Margaret Stapleton.— Muſgrave.—Tho.

               <p>
                  <q>Blackhall or Blackhill, commonly called Blackhell, is the name of the town and manor, ſo called of old, before it was inhabited; being a black heathy ground, part of the ancient foreſt of Englewood, and given by Henry I. to Odard de Logis, baron of Wigton, and citizen of Carliſle, after the Flemings were thence tranſlated: Odard firſt builded there and planted habitations, holding part in demeſne, and the reſidue in ſervice; ſome free, which he granted forth to be holden freely; others in bondage and villanage, ſome both perſons and land, ſome land only let to free men, perſons, in that age, called Drenges; and the tenure, in law, is called, "Drengagium notandum eſt eos omnes eorum anteceſſores, qui Drengorum claſſe erant, vel per Drengagium tenure, ſua in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coluiſſe patrimonia ante adventum Normanorum.</q>—SPELMAN.</p>

                  <q>Blackhill, thus made a manor by Odardus and his poſterity, deſcended by his iſſue male, according to the pedigree of Wigton, until the time of Edward III. when Margaret de Wigton, ſole daughter and heir of Sir John de Wigton, Knt. (laſt iſſue male of the eldeſt ſon of that houſe) to defend her birth-right, was glad to divide away the manors of Blackhill, Melmerby, and Stainton, to Robert Parving, the king's ſerjeant at law, for her ſtrength at the common law; the rectory of Wigton to the Abbey Holme, for the civil law; and Wigton itſelf to the Lord Anthony Lucy, for his help in the country, becauſe her mother, Idyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſa Lovelot, was bitterly taxed of incontinency, at the inſtance of Sir Richard Kirkbride, next heir male apparent to the land. But Margaret de Wigton re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved an eſtate, in all things but the rectory, to the heirs of her body, and died without iſſue. Therefore Blackhill fell to Sir Robert Parving, who married dame Catharine, the ſiſter of the ſaid Kirkbride, to Adam Parving, alias Peacock, the ſon of John Peacock, who married Johan, one of the daughters and coheirs of the ſaid Sir Robert Parving. After Adam, it deſcended in the blood of the Parvings ſome few deſcents, until Margaret, the wife of Thomas Boyt, and William Boyt his ſon, deſcended of the ſaid Johan, and Matild Walker, the daughter of Alice Atwood and Thomas Whitlockman, ſon and heir of Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Pape, daughters and heirs of Eme, wife of John Scaleby, the other daughter and heir of the ſaid Robert Parving, ſold the ſame to William Stapleton, and Marriotte his wife, of whom the Lord Dacre purchaſed it.</q>—DENTON's MS.</p>
               <p>By the deſcendants of Lord Dacre, it was ſold to Sir Chriſtopher Muſgrave, Bart. grandfather of the preſent owner, Sir John C. Muſgrave, Bart.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the pariſh of St. Mary is the manor of Caldcoates, alias Harrington Houſe. It was Gilbert Camterelles, A. D. 1371, who left it to Julian his wife: ſhe convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to John Semen, and Iſabel his wife, whoſe ſon, Thomas Semen, 26th Henry VI. ſold it to Richard Coldale of Carliſle, merchant, from whom it deſcended as followeth; and from this Coldale, has got the name of Coldale-Hall:—John Coldale, ſon of Richard.—Richard, ſon of John.—John, ſon of Richard.—John —Richard, ſon of John.—Elianor, daughter and heir of Richard, carried the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, by marriage, to Robert Briſcoe, ſon and heir of Leo.

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0873500300:68"/>This city had many royal grants, and great privileges: the firſt that is pointed out, is that of King Henry II. which was burnt by the devaſtations made by the Scots, and is recited and confirmed by the charter of King Henry III. It doth not appear when the firſt incorporation of the burgeſſes took place, or what was the original conſtitution. In the charter of King Henry III. we have theſe words, <q>Et quod ſimiliter habent Gildain mercatoriam liberam, ita quod nihil inde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeant aliquibus; etc. Nos omnes libertates illas et conſuetudinos praefatis civibus noſtris concedimus et hac carta noſtra confirmanus pro nobis et haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus noſtris; volentes, quod omnibus praedictis libertatibus et conſuetudinibus de caetera gaudeant et utantur, libere, quiete, bene et in pace; et integre, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum, cum omnibus aliis libertatibus et liberis conſuetudinibus ad praedictam villam Carlioli pertinentibus.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this charter the citizens were exempted from the payment of toll, paſſage, pontage, and all cuſtoms belonging to the king; with the privilege of having wood for fuel, and for their erections within the foreſt of Carliſle.</p>
               <p>Great part of the city having again ſuffered by accidental fire, the records were a ſecond time deſtroyed. King Edward I. in the 21ſt year of his reign, by charter, dated the 23d day of June, recites the grant of King Henry III. from the inroll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it in his chancery, and ſtating that it had been loſt by fire, confirmed it verbatim. In conſequence of his Scotch expeditions, he reſided frequently at Carliſle, and ſeems to have entertained a particular regard for the place, by his honouring the city with the aſſembly of his parliament in the 35th year of his reign; who made their reſidence there, from the 20th day of January to Palm Sunday following. The memorable acts of this parliament give no ſmall luſtre to our annals.</p>
               <p>King Edward III. alſo ſeems to have entertained a ſpecial affection and favour towards the citizens; and in order to ſecure to the burgeſſes their privileges, he cauſed an inquiſition to be taken, whereon he ſhould found his charter of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which bears date the 7th of February, in the 22d year of his reign of England, and 13th of France. Therein it is recited, that it having been found by inquiſition taken by his commiſſioners, Richard de Denton and John de Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and returned into his chancery, that the citizens, <q>habuerunt et habere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueverunt a tempore quo non exiſtit memoria,</q> had, and were uſed to have, the privileges therein ſet forth, for time immemorial, on the petition of the citizens; <q>ac etiam cives civitatis praedicta nobis ſupplicaverunt, ut ſibi dictas libertates, quietantias, conſuetudines et proficua per chartam noſtram confirmare velimus.</q> And in conſideration of its being in the frontier of Scotland, and well ſituated for the refuge and deſence of the inhabitants of the adjacent territories, againſt the frequent incurſions of the Scots: and alſo, in commiſeration of the late dreadful mortality of the plague, and the frequent devaſtations made by the northern ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

               <p>By the recitals of this grant it ſeems, that preceding it, and even for time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial, the city had been governed by a mayor, bailiffs, and coroners; but when this body politic had its commencement, there is no evidence that we have yet met with.</p>
               <p>King Richard II. in the 5th year of his reign, granted them a confirmatory charter.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of the ſpoil and devaſtation, made by the armies of Margaret, Queen of England, and Henry Duke of Exeter her adherent, the city obtained from King Edward IV. a relaxation of one half of the fee-farm rent of eighty pounds yearly, paid to the crown; and alſo gained a grant of the king's fiſheries of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle, in ſome records called the Sheriff's Net; in others, under the denomination of the fiſhery of Frith Net, in the water of Eden.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0873500300:72"/>There was an ancient hoſpital without the gates of the city, dedicated to St. Nicholas, and ſaid to be of royal foundation, though by what ſovereign is not known; it was inſtituted for the reception of thirteen lepers, of both ſexes. In the year 1180, it was endowed with a moiety of the tithes of Little Bampton, by Adam, ſon of Robert, on condition that it ſhould conſtantly receive two almſmen from thence. In the year 1336, the maſter brought a prohibition againſt the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0873500300:73"/>biſhop to prevent his viſitation, on an allegation of the hoſpital being a royal foundation. In 1371, the maſter, brethren, and ſiſters, lodged a complaint, that the houſe was defrauded of a great part of its revenues, on which the biſhop iſſued a monition, with the terrors of the greater excommunication, againſt all perſons who detained the corn, or other dues appertaining to this hoſpital. <q>It was granted to the prior and convent of the cathedral church here, 17th K. Edward IV. and afterwards 33d Henry VIII. made part of the endowment of the dean and chapter,</q> under whom the ſite of the hoſpital is now held by leaſe.

                  <q>The figure of a creſcent I here ſend you, is ſufficient to let you ſee what it is. It is of copper, found in digging a cellar oppoſite to the Buſh-Inn here. It lay about nine feet deep: as I looked upon it to be a choice piece of antiquity, I have procured the original for you: I take it to be a ſymbol of Iſis, and alſo wore by other gods. The ſhank or ſtem, by which it was ſtuck into the figure or ſtandard is very ſtrong, and has a hole for a pin to faſten it; from which ſhank, ariſes a ring on the backſide, which is alſo very ſtrong, and will take in a man's finger. I preſume it might be to faſten ſome parts of the garb or for what other uſe, I beg your thoughts.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>As for the braſs plate you ſent me, it ſeems to be nothing but an ornament belonging to the trappings of a horſe, and might have hung before his breaſt, by the ring on the backſide of it. The hole through the ſhank has been for faſtening a drop or pendant to it, as a further ornament.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>In opening a gravel pitt lately, on the ſide of a hill, in the pariſh of Stanwix, juſt without the ſuburbs of Carliſle, a ſtratum of bones were diſcovered, at about a yard below the ſurface, lying about a foot thick in moſt parts, and ſtretching the whole length of the pit, which I apprehend to be near twenty feet. I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the ſpot, and found divers fragments of Roman pottery ware,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Elegant ſpecimens, and ſome of the bones were exhibited.</note> intermixed with the bones. They are, I think, the bones of horſes, and might, perhaps,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0873500300:76"/>have been buried after an engagement between the Romans and Picts; but it is not ſo eaſy to account for the fragments of pottery, &amp;c. which were found in great numbers intermixed with them.</q>

               <p>In the Archaeologia, is publiſhed accounts of ſtone hatchets found at Carliſle, with a learned treatiſe thereon; and to which we refer the curious reader.</p>
               <p>If we may preſume to offer our ſentiments on theſe ſubjects, after the learned antiquaries have ſo elaborately expatiated thereon, without the appearance of arrogance and preſumption, we would ſuggeſt, that the bones mentioned by the biſhop, mixed with the fragments of the patarae, were the remains of ſacrifice: when the ordinary receptacle was cleaned out, this has been the general repoſitory. If theſe were the remains of animals ſlain in battle, the mixture is not to be reconciled; and it was more than ſuch occaſion would have required to clear them from the bones of men ſlain at the ſame time. The learned inquirer did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any remains of broken trapping, ſtudings, or ornaments of horſes, or men accoutrements. The hammers, or ſtone hatchets, ſeem very unfit for weapons of warfare, unweildy, and uncouth: if they had been in uſe in battle, ſome teſtimony would have been given of them; and they would not have been totally diſuſed, one might preſume, at the coming of the Romans, but would have been exhibited as trophies, or otherwiſe as teſtimonies of the valour of Britiſh heroes, the ancſtors of thoſe who appeared armed againſt the invaders, in the moſt ſacred cauſe of war, the defence of liberty, and their country; and the maintenance of the eſtabliſhed religion. We have received no account of ſuch weapons then in uſe. As domeſtic utenſils, it is not probable they would have been ſecreted with ſuch care, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited with ſuch ſolemnity, as even to ſupport the head of the deceaſed owner in the ſepulchre. Could we imagine the friends of any perſonage, who was to be interred with the funeral pomp of a tumulus, would buſy themſelves with giving the deceaſed labourer his beetle with him, for the regions of death We humbly conceive this was a ſacred implement in the poſſeſſion of the heathen prieſt, with which he prepared the ſacrifice: we have innumerable relations, of the abhorrence the ancients had, of their ſacred things and places being polluted by ſtrangers; and thence we trace the cauſe of theſe flints being concealed. All degrees of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, in remote ages, took great precaution to bury, with the conſecrated miniſter, the inſtruments of his office, and that was followed in the practice of the ancient Romiſh church. The ſacred <hi>ſecuris</hi> of the Britiſh prieſt, was the firſt emblem of his function, and the propereſt ornament to be placed with his remains in the tomb. The remnants of Britiſh prieſts were driven into Scotland by the arms of Rome; there they longeſt retained their ancient rites and religion, and there thoſe inſtruments of the ancient prieſthood have been moſt frequently found.

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0873500300:77"/>Carliſle, from its ſituation, was continually ſubject to the diſtreſs of warſare, in the ſeveral irruptions of the Scots; and frequently was taken from the Engliſh. The border wars were proſecuted with a degree of ferocity and ſavage barbarity, diſgraceful to humanity, and horrid in hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Among the various incidents in the hiſtory of Carliſle, the following are the moſt material.</p>
               <p>So ſoon, after the fortifications were conſtructed, as the beginning of the reign of King Stephen, David King of Scotland, in the firſt year of his reign, entered into England, and took poſſeſſion of this city. Stephen, on receiving the news, is ſaid to have exclaimed, "Quae doloſe cepit victorioſe recipiam;" but this weak prince, ſo far from performing what he boaſted, made a ceſſion of the whole county to the Scots.

               <p>In the year 1138, King David of Scotland, made this city the place of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, after his dreadful overthrow at the battle of the Standard. And here he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Alberic the pope's legate, by whoſe influence, all the women captives were brought to Carliſle and ſet at liberty. He obtained from the Scotch leaders, a ſolemn promiſe, that in future incurſions, they would ſpare the churches, and with hold their ſwords from the aged, from women and infants: an injunction which humanity dictated, but which the ſavage cuſtoms of the contending nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had not admitted into the modes of warfare.</p>
               <p>Henry, eldeſt ſon of the empreſs Maud, came to David at Carliſle, attended by the great barons of the weſtern parts of England, and received the order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0873500300:78"/>with much pomp and ceremony; the young prince then taking an oath, that on his acceſſion to the crown of England, he would confirm to David and his ſon, their Engliſh poſſeſſions: but ſuch are the oaths of princes! Henry no ſooner graſped the ſceptre, than he demanded of the Scotch regency, reſtitution of Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland: and in 1158, the two monarchs had an interview in this city; but much diſſention aroſe, and the claim of the Engliſh monarch was not complied with.

               <p>By an entry in the old regiſter book of the abbey, it appears that on the 4th June, 32d King Edward I. half the city was burnt down, as far as the gate of Richardby.</p>

Robert Brus, King of Scotland, on his incurſion laid waſte the country as far as Allerdale and Coupland in this county: he beſieged Carliſle in a regular form, by engines and other warlike modes, for ten days, and at length was obliged to withdraw his troops in great precipitation, leaving behind them moſt of their inſtruments of war. They were hotly purſued by the Engliſh; and two of the Scottiſh leaders, John de Moravia and Sir Robert Bardolph, were taken priſoners, and afterwards ranſomed.</p>
               <p>In the 15th year of King Edward II. Andrew Harcla, Earl of Carliſle, was ſeized in the caſtle, and ſuffered as a traitor. This action was ſo gallant, that it appears worth repeating here: the earl was publicly proclaimed a traitor, by the king's command, Anthony, Lord Lucy, was ſent to apprehend him. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſperſed his party in the city to prevent ſuſpicion, Lord Lucy, with a few attendants, entered the caſtle, as having buſineſs with the earl: his principal aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates in this enterprize, were Sir Hugh de Louther, Sir Richard de Denton, and Sir Hugh de Morriceby, with four eſquires in arms: the party, to whom the deſign was communicated, had ſignals appointed to them for their conduct in the buſineſs; and as the knights paſſed each gate, a number of men halted, as if care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly loitering for want of immediate employment; but with an intention to guard the paſs, prevent eſcapes, and to be at hand to lend their aid if occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. The four chiefs, with their eſquires, paſſed into the innermoſt, and moſt ſecure parts of the caſtle, even through the great hall, to the earl's private apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where, finding him ſitting in an unſuſpicious manner, Lord Lucy accoſted him, requiring him to ſurrender or defend himſelf; a cry of treaſon immediately echoed through the caſtle, and the keeper of the inner gate prepared to ſhut it, but was inſtantly ſlain by Sir Richard Denton. The watch-word being given, the parties formed into bodies, took poſſeſſion of the gates and avenues, and the earl, with the whole garriſon, ſurrendered without further bloodſhed.

               <p>Sir William Douglas of Lochmaben was kept in irons in the caſtle; (an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon act of ſeverity towards a priſoner of war) but he was eſteemed ſo enterpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dangerous an enemy by King Edward III. that this was done at his ſpecial command.</p>
               <p>In the year 1345, Penrith and Carliſle were burnt by the Scots, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir William Douglas. A body of the Scotch forces, headed by Sir Alexander Strachan, detached for foraging, were intercepted; and Sir Alexander was ſlain by Sir Robert Ogle, who ran him through the body with his lance. Biſhop Kirby, the eleventh biſhop of this dioceſe, ſignalized himſelf in this rencounter; for being diſmounted, and in imminent danger of being made a priſoner; he fought with uncommon bravery, recovered his horſe, and by his valour and animating exhortations, he ſpirited up his party, rallied them frequently, and brought them again to the ſight, to which the victory was deſervedly attributed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0873500300:80"/>In the ſixth year of the reign of King Richard II. the Scots ſent forth a plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering band, who ravaged the foreſt of Inglewood, ſacked Penrith at the time of the fair, and returned with a vaſt booty; having gained, as Hollingſhead ſays, a drove of 40,000 head of cattle.</p>
               <p>In the 29th year of King Henry VIII's reign, during Aſke's rebellion, Carliſle was beſieged by 8000 men, under the command of Muſgrave and Tilby, partizans in that affair, but they were repulſed by the garriſon; and as they were retiring, were intercepted by the Duke of Norfolk and his troops, who took all the leaders priſoners, except Muſgrave; thoſe, with about ſeventy others, he ordered to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate execution, and hung them on the city walls.</p>
               <p>In the 40th and 41ſt years of Queen Eilzabeth's reign, this place ſuffered a dreadful viſitation by the plague, in which their died 1196 perſons, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be one third of the whole inhabitants. It alſo raged in the adjacent country with a great mortality, as was mentioned when we ſpoke of Salkeld and Penrith: for the relief of the diſeaſed poor, contributions were raiſed for the city, to the amount of 209l. 9s. 10d.</p>
               <p>In the twentieth year of the reign of King Charles I. A. D. 1644, this place was ſurrendered to the parliament forces commanded by Leſley, having ſuſtained a ſiege and blockade from the 9th of October to June following; during which, the diſtreſs of the garriſon and inhabitants was ſo great, that the fleſh of horſes, dogs, and rats were eaten. Bread was ſo totally exhauſted, that hemp-ſeed was ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, ſo long as any was found in the place. Great aſſiſtance was given by the country, when proviſions could be thrown in, to the amount in value of 463l. 10s. procured by private ſubſcriptions. On ſurrender, honourable terms of capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were obtained, both for the military with honours of war, as alſo for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants their liberties and properties.</p>
               <p>A coinage of ſilver pieces of three ſhillings value took place in the caſtle during the ſiege, from the plate of the inhabitants, ſent in for that purpoſe. They are become very ſcarce, and bear a conſiderable price with the curious.</p>
               <p>The laſt hoſtile acts, of which Carliſle was the ſcene, were thoſe in the Scotch rebellion, 1745. It ſurrendered to the chevalier on the 14th of November, who lay before it with his whole army. The gazette account of this event, ſaid that for ſeven days before, neither the officers nor the common men of the garriſon got ſcarce an hour's reſt, being perpetually under alarms; that many were ſo ſick through their great fatigue, that being out of all hopes of ſpeedy relief, they abſolutely refuſed to hold out any longer, and multitudes went off every hour over the walls; ſome of whom fell into the hands of the rebels, till the officers of ſeveral companies were at laſt left with three or four men; ſo that the mayor and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration determined to hang out a white flag (though contrary to the opinion and proteſtation of Colonel Durand) and made the beſt terms they could get for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: that the colonel was thereupon obliged to abandon the caſtle, not having above ſeventy invalids in his whole corps, and moſt of them unfit for ſervice: the rebels threatening, in caſe of refuſal, to ſack and deſtroy the whole town with fire and ſword."

               <head>THE MODERN STATE OF THE CITY OF CARLISLE.
<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>We confeſs our obligations to Mr. R. Longrigg, a native of this city, for this account of the modern ſtate of Carliſle.</p>
                     <bibl>THE EDITORS.</bibl>

               </head>
               <p>The city of Carliſle (the origin of which is loſt in the uncertainties of antiquity) ſtands upon a pleaſing eminence, which having every way a gradual deſcent, the town is eaſily kept clean, without the aid of a common ſhore. Being a frontier town towards Scotland, it is fortified with a wall and citadel now in ruins, and a caſtle kept ſtill in ſome ſort of repair. Whilſt South and North Britain had each their reſpective king, and the inhabitants of the two kingdoms lived in habits of enmity with each other, Carliſle, expoſed to the calamities of war, was often ſacked, and its citizens plundered and murdered. Diſmal times to live in! The acceſſion of the Stuart family to the crown of England ſomewhat abated national animoſities and miſeries; and the union, by conferring reciprocal privileges, and opening a free intercourſe between the two countries, has obliterated invidious diſtinctions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the people on both ſides the Tweed, that their vicinity to each other ſhould have induced their anceſtors, always to cultivate habits of amity and friendſhip with their neighbours.</p>
               <p>From the wall, which may be aſcended in different parts by flights of ſteps, the eye is entertained with a beautiful and extenſive landſcape, and imperceptibly led into ſeveral diſtant counties, whilſt Scotland and Solway-Frith
<note n="*" place="bottom">And the adjacent mountains, ſome of whoſe ſummits touch the clouds.</note> do not a little contribute to enliven the enchanting ſcene. The city is ſurrounded with three rivers, Petteril on the ſouth, Eden on the eaſt and north, and Caude on the weſt, whoſe meandering ſtreams are ſeen in many places at a great diſtance.—A garriſon was formerly kept here; but there has been none for the laſt thirty years. The military who may be ſtationed in the town for a time, are quartered upon the public houſes in the city and ſuburbs. Carliſle has ſtill a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and deputy governor, whoſe places are only <hi>ſine cures.</hi> A town major, engineer, barrack maſter, ſtore-keeper, head-gunner, three quarter-gunners, &amp;c. When the governor of this city happened to be one of its repreſentatives in parliament, the ſubordinate places in the garriſon were given to freemen, (but generally to ſuch as were in the corporation) ſo that frequently the <hi>chief magiſtrate</hi> was a quarter-gunner at the ſame time. Thus was the invalid, worn out in the ſervice of his king and country, too frequently overlooked in the diſpoſition of this appointment.</p>
               <p>Carliſle being a biſhop's ſee, has a cathedral, in which are performed the cathedral ſervice; in the ſame edifice is performed the parochial ſervice of St. Mary's: and in a part of it the chancellor of the dioceſe holds the conſiſtory court. As this religious edifice is the chief ornament of the city, a ſhort deſcription of it may, perhaps, not be deemed improper.</p>
               <p>The choir of this venerable pile is the moſt magnificent part of the building. It has a ſtately ſteeple, with a ring of eight bells, the roof is covered with lead, and being conſiderably higher than the other buildings in the city, has a very ſine effect when viewed as a diſtant object. This noble edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice being partly of Gothic and partly of Saxon architecture, offers what is worthy the inſpection of the architect and antiquarian. Contiguous to the cathedral is an extenſive church-yard, (the principal bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground) ſurrounded with a wall ſeven feet high, in the inſide of which is a row of lofty plane trees, whoſe branches overhang a part of the adjacent ſtreet and form a ſhade, under which is a fine paved walk much reſorted to. Within the precincts of the abbey, beſides the cathedral, there are ſeveral ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable buildings, which (except the prebends' houſes) ſhew marks of antiquity.</p>
               <p>St. Cuthbert's, the other pariſh church in Carliſle, is a modern edifice, rebuilt in the year 1778, upon the ſite of the old church, but without any kind of external or internal ornament. It has a ſquare ſteeple or tower, but ſo confined as not to admit of a ring of bells; ſo that the pariſhioners are called together to their devotion by the weak tinklings of the old bell, which was not exchanged for one of a louder tone. The ſteeple is decorated with a dome covered with lead; from which a fane projects, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the year in which the church was rebuilt cut in it.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe two churches, there are in Carliſle, three Proteſtant diſſenting meeting-houſes,
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dr. Robert Henry was called and ordained to preach to the Preſbyterian congregation in Fiſher-ſtreet, Carliſle, in November 1748, and continued with them 12 years; and on the 13th of Auguſt, he became paſtor of a diſſenting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in Berwick upon Tweed.</note> one Quaker, and one Methodiſt meeting-houſe; Weſley's connection.</p>
               <p>The public buildings are, the Town-hall, Moot hall, and Council-chamber, conſpicuouſly ſituated in the centre of the city; and to which you aſcend by a ſlight of broad ſteps from the promenade. Above the entrance are placed the arms of the corporation. Here are held the criminal and Niſi Prius courts
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0873500300:84"/>of Aſſize for the county; the Quarter Seſſions, the Mayor's Court, the election for members to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the city in parliament, &amp;c. The records and writings belonging to the corporation, the freemen's admiſſions, &amp;c. are kept in detached offices belonging to the ſame building.
<note n="‖" place="bottom">It is to be lamented that the houſes under the Moot-hall are the private property of different perſons: to purchaſe theſe would require a deal of money. The funds of the corporation are not competent for this; therefore, there are little hopes of ever ſeeing this edifice become an ornament to the city, by being rebuilt upon a more uſeful and elegant plan.</note> The council-chamber is ornamented with a cupola and clock. The Guild-hall, in which the free trades hold their meetings, is ſituate at the head of Fiſher-ſtreet; and though it has the appearance of antiquity, is but a very mean ſtructure

It ſeems to be a modern edifice, has a neat appearance, but without any cover: it has the corporation arms cut upon it; underneath which was ſculptured, but of late years defaced, a lion with its paw upon a large folio, alluding either to magna charta or the city charter. The guard-houſe, contiguous to the butcher-market, is a very great nuiſance, and hurts the view of the principal ſtreets; and what renders it ſtill more ſo is, the corporation have granted leaſes, and built houſes adjoining to it, perhaps, upon the royal property. Near the Engliſh-gate are charity houſes, built by the corporation, in which decayed freemen, or the widows of thoſe deceaſed, are allowed to live gratis. In Carliſle there is one endowed ſchool.

               </p>
               <p>The corporation of this city conſiſts of a recorder, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four common council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<note n="¶" place="bottom">Preſent recorder, T. Garforth, Eſq.—John Barnes, attorney at law, deputy town-clerk.</note> One of the aldermen is annually choſen mayor, and the other annual place-men are choſen out of the common council. The ſubordinate officers are three ſerjeants at mace, five bedals, or town ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers. The ſerjeants and bedals wear the corporation livery, and their places are generally for life. The ſerjeants act as bailiffs in proceſſes before the mayor's court, and to them is committed the execution of ſummons and writs of arreſt for debt iſſued by it. The office of the bedals is to keep the ſtreets clean, and to put in execution the puniſhment awarded to offenders within the mayor's juriſdiction. The liberties of the corporation extend a few yards without the city walls, and are aſcertained by what is called the Freelidge ſtone, with their arms ſculptured upon it. It may alſo be proper to obſerve, that the public and private buildings belonging to the body corporate, have the name of the mayor by whom, and the year in which each edifice was erected, ſculptured on ſome conſpicuous part, ſo that the traveller's eye often catches theſe words, <hi>"Erected by — Eſq. Mayor,"</hi> even upon a mean edifice.</p>
               <p>Carliſle, about the beginning of the preſent century, exhibited no marks of modern convenience and elegance. The buildings, moſtly of wood, clay, and laths, beſpoke the poverty and bad taſte of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. The gabels fronted the ſtreets, the doors were generally in the centre, and many of the houſes had porches which projected two or three yards into the ſtreet, <hi>doubtleſs for warmneſs.</hi> The front door was arched, or Gothic, formed to correſpond with the gabel; and the diminutive windows, which gave light to the inner apartments, were very improperly placed, but of the ſame order.
<note n="§" place="bottom">The moſt of the houſes did not exceed the height of one ſtory, and were chiefly covered with thatch. Thoſe of two ſtories had the upper rooms inlaid with ſtrong oak, and unceiled below. The lanes and avenues, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ven the church road, were not paved: and in many places entirely covered with weeds and underwood. The ſtreets, not often trode upon, were, in many parts of them, green with graſs.</note> The doors were of oak, very ſtrong and clumſy, put together with large wood pins, a part of which projected an inch or two from the door. Theſe pins were many in number, and ſometimes placed in figures romanticly irregular. Houſes were not then painted either within or without; this being only a modern improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſtreets, though ſpacious, were paved with large ſtones, and the centre part or cauſeway, roſe to a conſiderable height. The fronts from the houſes were paved in the ſame manner, the conſequence of which was, that the kennels or gutters were deep trenches, and ſtone bridges were placed in many different parts, for the convenience of paſſing from one ſide of the ſtreet to the other. Theſe gutters were the reſervoirs of all kinds of filth, which when a ſudden heavy rain happened, by ſtopping the conduit of the bridges, inundated the ſtreets ſo, as to render them impaſſable on foot.</p>
               <p>The ſhambles, which ſtood in the market place, were private property, and being built entirely of wood and covered with different kinds of ſlate, gave them a very groteſque and antique appearance. At the north end of the ſhambles was a well, over which was a building placed upon pillars, called Carnaby's
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0873500300:85"/>Folly. On the front of each ſide of this building was the fiſh market: the Folly and the ſhambles have been lately taken down, the latter having been purchaſed, at a great price, by the corporation. The former was their own property. For this the corporation deſerve the thanks of the inhabitants of Carliſle, as the ſhambles, by occupying a great part of one of the principal ſtreets of the city, were a public nuiſance.</p>
               <p>Little more than half a century ago, the inhabitants of Carliſle carried on no foreign commerce.— Their trade conſiſted in that of a good weekly market, two annual fairs, and two extraordinary well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſtatutes, for hiring ſervants. The annual fairs in this city, formerly drew together numbers of people from many parts of England and Scotland. The buſineſs for the whole year was ſettled at theſe meetings; as in many places the intercourſe between town and town, or man and man, was not yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by way of port carriers, and other public conveyances. The aſſize and public diverſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed greatly to draw together the neighbouring gentry. Though there was very little trade and commerce in this city, yet the inhabitants did not ſeem to know the want of it. The neceſſaries of life were uncommonly cheap, and the chief part of their wearing apparel was of their own ſpinning.— Pride and luxury in eating, drinking, furniture and dreſs, had not yet made their entrance within the city walls; induſtry and hoſpitality were the prominent features of the people. The victuallers brewed their own ale, of a good quality, and ſold it for threepence a quart, full meaſure. And (ſuch was the cuſtom of the place) ſeldom did a company call for the ſecond pot, without the landlord or landlady preſenting them with the fare of the houſe to reliſh their liquor. Spirituous liquors were very ſeldom made uſe of: though the inhabitants were not opulent, yet many of them had conſiderable property, and for the moſt part under a good tenure.
<note n="*" place="bottom">The principal part of the houſes in Carliſle are freehold; a few are leaſehold under the dean and chapter, and the corporation; and a ſew under the king.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The town, at the time we are ſpeaking of, was not very populous, and therefore the office of mayor, or chief magiſtrate, was conſidered to be of great conſequence. He ſeldom appeared in public without the rod of juſtice, and had always one of the ſerjeants to attend him. The baleful ſeeds of party were not then ſown among the inhabitants, a friendly and neighbourly intercourſe pervaded the whole city. All the ancient cuſtoms were kept up with harmony and feſtivity, and man united to man by love and good fellowſhip, circumſtanced as the inhabitants were, living in the centre of a rich and well cultivated country, it is no wonder if their minds were free. In ages prior to this aera, they had been expoſed to one continued ſcene of warfare. Under this hazardous ſituation, it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed that, their contentions could not lead them to dive much into the myſteries and fluctuations attendant upon a trading intercourſe. And ſuppoſe they had been in affluent circumſtances, it cannot be imagined they would have expended their money in building. Having been ſo long accuſtomed to the calamities inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to war, they wiſhed for nothing more than to enjoy that tranquility, they and their anceſtors had been ſo long ſtrangers to.</p>
               <p>This city continued in the ſituation above-mentioned, without any material alteration either in reſpect to trade or improvement in building, till the rebellion in 1745. Soon after this period, a company of Hamburgh merchants fixed upon Carliſle as a proper place to carry on an extenſive woolen manufactory.
<note n="‖" place="bottom">This manufactory was carried on to a very great extent in broad and plain cloths. All the diſſerent branches of the buſineſs, from the ſheep ſhearing to the finiſhing the pieces, were performed. And as moſt of the work was done in various parts of the country, the pariſhes were little affected by an increaſe of paupers; the purvey then ſeldom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding twenty or thirty in a year. This was the mode of collecting the poor rate at that time, and for long after.</note> The diſtance from Lincolnſhire, Yorkſhire, Scotland, and thoſe parts of the two kingdoms enriched with the ſtaple commodity, was a very inconſiderable object to this company of adventurers. To faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate this undertaking, two gentlemen (brothers) of the name of Dewlicher, were ſent over from the continent to ſuperintend the work. This manufactory was of great importance to the inhabitants of Carliſle and the country around. It brought from various parts of the three kingdoms many workmen in the different branches of the woolen trade. People, to the diſtance of twenty miles from the city were employed, and every loom that could be got was engaged. The moſt ſanguine hopes were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that the undertaking would anſwer the end propoſed: and never were two men engaged in any buſineſs more carreſſed by all ranks of people, than the Dewlichers were. A few years after this manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory was eſtabliſhed, the elder brother died, who had taken the moſt active part of the buſineſs upon himſelf; and who, from its flouriſhing ſtate during his life, ſeemed to be every way competent to ſo great a truſt.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0873500300:86"/>her was the ruin of this once flouriſhing manufactory brought about. Having the aſcendancy over her credulous huſband, ſhe perſuaded him to diſmiſs moſt of the old workmen, who were overſeers, from their employment: theſe men having been bred to the buſineſs, were capable of conduting the different bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of it. In their places, the relations and acquaintances of the new miſtreſs were ſubſtituted, people that knew nothing of the matter. Things ſoon began to wear a different aſpect; the workmen were much diſſatisfied with their new maſters; quarrels and complaints daily increaſed, and a very little time put a finiſhing hand to the whole undertaking: for, by miſmanagement on the part of the new foremen, and by the negligence and extravagance of the ſuperintendant and his wife, the company was declared inſolvent: and as no perſon or company would come forward as ſucceſſors, Carliſle, in a very little time, was reduced to the ſtate it was in at the commencement of this manufactory.
<note n="†" place="bottom">All the ſtock in trade, as wool, yarn, cloth, &amp;c. and all the implements of the work, were ſold by auction, at ſcarcely a fourth part of the value.</note> The failure of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was ſeverely felt by many in Carliſle and the neighbourhood; for, as nothing was carried forward as a ſubſtitute to employ the induſtrious poor, thoſe who had been employed in the work were driven to travel with their families to different parts to ſeek for employment; and for many months nothing but diſtreſs appeared around Carliſle for ſeveral miles.

Very little improvement had taken place in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the ſtreets continued in the ſame ſituation. Manure was at this time of ſo little value, that the corporation gave a man forty ſhillings a-year, and a new cart occaſionally, to take it away once a-week. All the goods which came to this place from Newcaſtle, were conveyed chiefly upon pack-horſes; the roads were impaſſable the greateſt part of the ſeaſon for any other conveyance. No public works were carried on, except a ſmall manufactory for linen by an Alderman Cook, and a whip manufactory, under the firm of Brown and company, which employed a few paupers. Whips and fiſh-hooks were the two chief articles in trade Carliſle was noted for.
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Brown's whips.—Ford's fiſh-hooks.</note> Great quantit es of coarſe linen yarn were weekly expoſed in this market for ſale, chiefly from the borders and Scotland, where the people grew their own flax, and ſpun it. This yarn was principally purchaſed by country weavers, or by people commiſſioned to buy and ſend it to manufacturing towns.
<note n="§" place="bottom">Thoſe who did not grow their own flax, bought it undreſſed of the ſhopkeepers in the city, and ſlax dreſſers went about the country, from village to village, and houſe to houſe, to dreſs it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Little increaſe in population had hitherto taken place. A few foot ſoldiers and artillery men kept garriſon, and theſe were quartered chiefly upon the public. Carliſle, at this time, kept up the appearance of a formidable place: centries were ſtationed at every gate, at the commanding-officer's houſe, the caſtle, &amp;c. and the gates were ſhut, and locked every night with much military parade; morning and evening guns were fired as a ſignal when to open and ſhut the garriſon gates, and pieces of ordnance were placed upon the turrets, ſituated in different parts of the fortification.</p>
               <p>The publicans ſtill continued to brew their own ale, and moſt of them made their own malt.
<note n="¶" place="bottom">Britiſh ſpirits, viz. Brandy, Gin, Cinnamon, and Anniſeed Waters, were now ſo plenty and cheap, that there was ſcarcely a gingerbread ſtall but ſold them.</note> It had been a cuſtom for many years backward, for the corporation to demand multure, by compelling the victuallers to grind the malt at their mills. This began to be felt as an oppreſſion; and to remove the grievance, and ſave the multure, many of them provided ſmall hand mills of their own. The corporation, irritated at this breach of what they deemed their right, refuſed to grant licences to the refractory inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers. The public, however, would not comply, but brought an action at law, to compel them to ſhew upon what grounds ſo intolerable and arbitrary a cuſtom reſted. The action was determined in favour of the victuallers; and this became a heavy ſtroke to the corporation revenue.
<note n="**" place="bottom">This action, which was tried at York, beſides the loſs of their mulcture, was attended with a heavy expence to the body corporate.

                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0873500300:87"/>About the year 1750, the trade of Carliſle began to have a different appearance. A manufactory of coarſe linen cloth, called Oſnaburghs was eſtabliſhed:
<note n="†" place="bottom">The late aldermen, Richard and William Hodgſon, were the proprietors of this Oſnaburgh manufactory.</note> this kind of work can be wrought by women and boys at the loom. About the ſame time, there aroſe a new woolen manufactory, chiefly womens' wear, the proprietor of which was a George Blamire. From the time of the Dewlichers, the woolen buſineſs had been almoſt entirely neglected in Carliſle; the little which was done this way, was by three brothers of the name of Machrell, from Yorkſhire. Blamire's manufactory was of ſhort duration; and after his time, except what was done by the Machrells, and by one Thorpe, and this to no great amount, the buſineſs was no more purſued by any other adventurer.</p>
               <p>At the period we are ſpeaking of, the military road between Carliſle and Newcaſtle was begun. Prior to this date, this road from the city was by the Engliſh gate, and Warwick bridge; but now the route was changed, and travellers go by the Scotch-gate. The new road was planned near four miles more to the north than the old one. The badneſs of the road had hitherto been a great hindrance to the conveyance of merchant goods from Newcaſtle to this place and Whitehaven: and Dumfries, from this circumſtance only, had greatly the advantage: but when this turnpike was completed, then the caſe was much altered for the better. Large carts and waggons were ſoon introduced, and nothing was now wanting but a ſufficient loading from Carliſle: this want was in ſome ſort ſupplied by people buying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commiſſion, and others upon their own account, and ſending off large quantities of butter and bacon for the London market. It was now that proviſions began to riſe in price, the butchers to ſell their meat by weight, and the country frugal houſe-wiſe to throw aſide her old pound ſtone, ſubſtituting in its place, the ſtandard of ſixteen ounces for weighing her butter. Every article of life increaſed in value: in the mean time the face of the country began to wear a more cultivated aſpect. John Holmes, Eſq. who had eſtates in different parts of the county,
<note n="*" place="bottom">This gentleman kept in his own hand, and improved, the following valuable eſtates: Braken, or Brakenhill, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rockſide, Barrockfield, Barronling, Durdar, Ragmire, Brackenhow, Holmhill, all in the neighbourhood of Carliſle; beſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Butter, before this time, was generally 20 or 22 ounces to the pound.</note> was a gentleman of a perſevering ſpirit, in making trial of the ſeveral modes of agriculture: no part of huſbandry was loſt in him for the ſake of expence, or procuring men uſed to agricultural improvements. Mr. Holmes' laudable ſpirit opened the eyes of the country in general, and every ſucceeding year added ſomething to the former, to the advantage of the induſtrious huſbandman. It has already been obſerved, that manure was of little value; that what the ſtreets of Carliſle aſſorded was conveyed away by a perſon who had an annual ſalary: it now became an article of value, and the produce of the ſtreets was generally put up to lett along with the corporation lands.
<note n="§" place="bottom">This article now conſtitutes a part of the corporation revenue, being let, <hi>communibus annis,</hi> for upwards of 50l.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The county and city tolls were a part of the corporation revenue. The number of black cattle which came into England from Ireland and Scotland, by the way of Cumberland, and moſtly by Carliſle, greatly increaſed the value of the toll; but as the collecting of it was attended with trouble and danger, the drovers endeavouring to evade this toll as an impoſition, it alſo underwent a trial at law, in which the drovers were defeated, on the grounds that the barrier fortreſs was ſtill maintained: but as the collecting of this toll from theſe refractory people, is ſtill attended with difficulty; the perſon who undertakes the whole farm from the corporation, generally lets it out in parcells to different people, who live moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the places where the droves take their departure out of the county.</p>
               <p>At this period, manufactories of linen and cotton began rapidly to encreaſe in Carliſle; and this increaſe in the branches of ſpinning and weaving brought many Scotch and Iriſh weavers, with their families, to reſide in the city and its environs. The population of the city had encreaſed very little for forty or fifty years prior to the eſtabliſhment of theſe manufactories. The bleaching of yarn was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of theſe manufactories, and it went on very proſperouſly. Carliſle is a place very well adapted for carrying on the linen and cotton manufactories to a very great extent. The progreſs of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment advanced with rapid ſteps. Every year houſes were rebuilt upon a more elegant plan, and alſo many new ones. The graſs which disfigured the ſtreets, lanes, and avenues, began daily to diſappear.</p>
               <p>In the year 1756, a brewery commenced in the ſuburbs of the city, without the Iriſh Gates, under the firm of Atkinſon and Co. But the inhabitants of Carliſle and the neighbourhood, having been long accuſtomed to home brewed ale, did not reliſh this factory drink, ſo that it was ſometime before this public brewery met with much encouragement: though after a few years' trial the prejudice was entirely removed, and the ſucceſs of the undertaking has ſufficiently proved its utility, and fully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the end the company had in view. The many new manufactories now begun, and the increaſe of population attendant on them raiſed the purvey. But as this did not then ſeem grievous to the ancient
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0873500300:88"/>inhabitants, I only mention it as a prelude to what afterwards became a ſevere burthen. Not long after, the ſtreets of the city, and that part of the liberties without the walls, were paved upon a new plan. This alteration for the better (to the great credit of the corporation) removed many intolerable nuiſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And the inhabitants of the ſuburbs, and that part of the ſuburbs which came under the direction of the ſurveyor of the highways, were alſo put under a proper regulation. Richardgate felt the good effects of this alteration; being expoſed to inundations from the overflowing of the river Eden, it now felt only in part what formerly was almoſt general.</p>
               <p>In the year 1758, were brought here a number of French priſoners from Edinburgh caſtle. Theſe were ſoon followed by the regular troops of Thurot's ſquadron, captured by the brave captain Elliot; and about three or four hundred more were ſent to Carliſle, from Launceſton in Cornwall. All theſe priſoners, except Thurot's regulars, were upon their parole of honour. As each of theſe priſoners had ſeven ſhillings a week regularly paid them, this cauſed a deal of money to be expended. The French priſoners were ſoon after followed by the Weſtmorland militia; and as the inhabitants of that county were much prejudiced againſt a military life, they entered into a voluntary ſubſcription to allow their balloted men, or ſubſtitutes, an additional ſum to the king's pay, ſo that many of the privates had from one to three ſhillings per day. Two companies of invalids kept garriſon in the caſtle;
<note n="§" place="bottom">The militia kept an officer's guard at Cromwell's Green-houſe.</note> and did alſo duty as centinels at the ſeveral gates. Such a number of men in the city, and ſo well circumſtanced as to money, greatly benefited the place. The conſequence of this influx of wealth was, the introduction of more expenſive modes of living. Now four wheeled carriages began to run from the different inns.
<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Waugh, Dean of Worceſter, a coach and four horſes; Major Farrer kept a ſingle horſe chaiſe; Mr. Dobinſon a ſingle horſe chaiſe; General Stanwix, a coach and ſour horſes, when the family was in town, which was but ſeldom. Theſe were all the private carriages kept in the city at this time.</note> To this period, 1759, there had not been any public conveyance for travellers in poſt chaiſe from this city. Hitherto balls and aſſemblies had been kept in a room at the caſtle; and when any gave a ball it was chiefly at the Buſh Inn: but now an aſſembly room is built, and finiſhed for that purpoſe, in a plain and neat manner.</p>
               <p>The year 1761 ſaw new works eſtabliſhed. A company from Newcaſtle begun the calico printing buſineſs, which has been progreſſively carried on ever ſince, and affords employment to many hundreds of men, women, and children. This was followed by an extenſive manufactory, carried on by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Bernard Barton, whoſe premature death deprived the public of the abilities of an able and enterpriſing tradeſman. Theſe public works employed a great deal of good land about the city, ſo that the value of ground, either in the ſelling price or in letting, roſe conſiderably: and the increaſe of population, owing to theſe cauſes, may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to occaſion an equal riſe in every other article bought and ſold.</p>
               <p>As the year 1761 was an aera of real advantage to Carliſle, both with reſpect to the proſpect of an increaſing commerce and the further progreſs of politics; the reader, we hope, will not deem it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that we are a little more particular. The printing or ſtamping of Calico was introduced here about this period. Gentlemen from Newcaſtle and its vicinity, under the firm of Scot, Lamb, and Co. were the firſt eſtabliſhers of this branch of trade, in the environs of Carliſle. And as the Calico buſineſs has been the principal means of increaſing the population of the city, it is ſufficient to remark that the flouriſhing advances of this manufactory induced others to form themſelves into companies to begin and carry on the ſame buſineſs. Some of them were men unacquainted with commerce; for in former times a country Eſq. would have thought it a degradation of his rank, to have his name entered with any company in a manufacturing or mercantile line. Time has removed this prejudice, and men are convinced that trade enriches, in particular, thoſe engaged in it, and the public in general. Common day labour for men not bred to any mechanic trade, and lint or two ſpinning for women in indigent circumſtances, was all the employment that could be obtained. Eight pence or ten pence a day, without victuals, was as much as a labourer could earn, and a woman muſt have worked very hard at her wheel to make a ſhilling a week, The employment for children was winding pirns for weavers or twiſting whips, for which they had only about eight pence per week, and generally worked ſixteen hours out of the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four.</p>
               <p>The eſtabliſhment of the calico manufactory greatly altered the caſe. The work in the green or bleach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard found employment for men and ſtout boys. Apprentices were taken to the ſeveral branches of the work, viz. Drawers, Cutters, and Calico printers, at a genteel weekly allowance, and their wages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed as they advanced in their ſervitude. Little boys were employed as tearing boys to the printers.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0873500300:89"/>Women had tables ſet out for them to pencil the colours into the pieces. Every table employed three or four female children; and even the youngeſt boys and girls could make near two ſhillings per week. Such encouragement brought numbers of families out of the country into the city and ſuburbs, and ſo great was the change, that a common labourer, who probably, with his wife's aſſiſtance, did not make above eight ſhillings weekly, could, by having his family fixed in the manner repreſented, eaſily earn twenty or thirty ſhillings a week. Nay, ſuch was the infatuation of the young men, or deſire of great wages, that many who had ſerved an apprenticeſhip to a mechanic trade, bound themſelves a new to the ſtampery; and even thoſe that were married followed the ſame ſteps, perſuaded that this manufactory would give the whole family bread. People of property reaped their advantage from this increaſe of population, as land and houſes increaſed in value.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral manufactories began to thrive much beyond the moſt ſanguine expectation. People in trade, with little to begin with, acquired fortunes which enabled them to live in a much more ſplendid ſtyle than formerly. The town rapidly improved, and the land around increaſed in value, far beyond what could have been foreſeen. The advantages, however, were balanced by ſome inconveniences: people of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, who taſted not the ſweets of a thriving trade, began to feel the diſadvantages which aroſe from the increaſe of population. Before the year 1761, the poor rates were not felt by thoſe who paid them: forty purveys in a year was the annual collection. This was the mode purſued, and the inhabitants acted in the office of collecting by rotation. But the increaſe of manufactories invited numbers of ſtrangers here for bread. The town was ſoon filled with Scotch and Iriſh families; and as theſe people had no place to return to, in caſe of indigence and ſickneſs, they became a great burthen upon the ancient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. This was not the only grievance; the mode of collection was very irregular, being ſtill by the old rate. New improvements did not pay any kind of proportion, nor did the manufacturers, though thoſe were the only people that throve by this increaſe of trade, and the cauſe which brought theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the city, pay any kind of rate for their valuable ſtocks in trade. This cauſed a general murmur amongſt the ancient inhabitants, and a redreſs was loudly called for. A pound rate was thought to be the moſt equitable mode, and after many veſtry meetings it was finally agreed to. All this time, neither the pariſh of St. Mary, or St. Cuthbert, had a common workhouſe: the poor were either let out, or paid out, in their own houſes. The pariſh of St. Mary ſeeing the diſadvantage which aroſe from this mode of providing for the poor, entered into a ſubſcription to build a workhouſe; the good effects of which have been felt by the inhabitants, as well as by the poor that receive the benefit.</p>
               <p>The chief part of the manufactoring buſineſs before the year 1761, conſiſted of a few check and Oſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg looms, and about a dozen of looms employed in weaving very fine linen. But after the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the manufactory of printed or ſtamped calicoes, cotton looms were ſet up. The ſtamperies had before this, been ſupplied with cottons from Lancaſhire, at an extraordinary expence in carriage; but now machinery for carding, roving, and ſpinning of cotton, is erected in different places in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the city, and they purchaſe their cottons at a cheaper rate. This machinery employs a great number of men and women, of old and young. Buildings, particularly in the environs, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazingly increaſed, and ſo has every trade in proportion.—We ſhall now only paticularize the different employments:—</p>
               <p>At preſent there are four printfields which employ about one thouſand people, and pay above 20,000l. annually to the revenue. Their firms are Meſſrs. Lamb, Scot, Forſter, and Co.—Meſſrs. Loſh and Co. Meſſrs. Mitchell, Ellwood, and Co —Meſſrs. Donald, Carrick, Shaw, and Co.—Meſſrs. Wood and Co. who employs above two hundred people in ſpinning of cotton.—Meſſrs. Forſters have the moſt extenſive manufactory in the north of England, in all the branches from the raw materials to the finiſhing of checks, calicoes, muſlins, and all kinds of fancy work.—Meſſrs. Ferguſons are next in extent in ſimilar articles.—Meſſrs. Langcake, M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>William, and Co. manufacturers in ſimilar articles.—Meſſrs. Stoddards, ditto—Mr. Thomas Pearſon, ditto.—Mr. Nixon, ditto.—Meſſrs. Wilſon and Co. muſlins. —Beſides the brewery previouſly mentioned, a few years after another was eſtabliſhed near it, now under the firm of Meſſrs. Pattrickſon and Co. and lately Mr. Daniel Pattinſon erected another; theſe three breweries pay above 6000l. duty annually; and juſt now there is another erected by Mr. Haugh.— There is a ſoapry under the firm of Meſſrs. Barker and Langcake, which pays about 1500l. duty annually; when thereto is added the duties upon candles, leather, licences, and other things under the exciſe, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle pays above 100,000l. annual revenue.—Beſides theſe public works, there are many others on a ſmaller ſcale; and all the common trades are carried on to great perfection.</p>
               <p>The late Mr. Forſter and ſons eſtabliſhed a bank here, and Mr. Wilſon another, which is of great ſervice to trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0873500300:90"/>WAGES, within theſe twelve months, have roſe, much owing to the advance in all the neceſſaries of life.—Calico printers make from one and a half, to two guineas per week; carpenters, joiners, maſons, and bricklayers here 2s. 6d. per day; labourers, from 1s. to 1s. 8d.; weavers earn from 10s. to 1l. 1s. per week, according to their abilities; and the ſame with all the other trades.—For the former rate of wages, proviſions, &amp;c. ſee our account of Brampton, being nearly the ſame, vol. I. page 131.</p>
               <p>FRIENDLY SOCIETIES were eſtabliſhed here about twenty years ago, and are now ſeven for men and three for women; conſiſting of about twelve hundred members. A number of gentlemen are joined to theſe ſocieties, which add much to their reſpectability, and ſtrengthens their funds: their allowance to ſick and old members is in proportion to their funds; and members or their relatives are genteely buried at the ſociety's expence.—There are two maſonic ſocieties conſiſting of a number of reſpectable people.</p>

                  <head>Further Particulars reſpecting Carliſle Market.</head>
                  <p>LAMB, in the early part of the ſeaſon, ſells for 1s. 3d. per lb. but continues lowering in value as it becomes leſs rare, till it may be bought for 3d halpenny, and 3d. per lb. From Chriſtmas till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Lady-Day, ten to twelve carcaſes of beef are weekly diſpoſed of in the market: from that time till Martinmas, ſixteen to eighteen may be ſold per week; and from Martinmas to Chriſtmas, thirty-five to forty per week. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the number increaſes ſo much in the latter period, is a prevalent cuſtom among the people in the neighbouring country, of buying a quantity of beef at that ſeaſon to ſalt and dry for the winter's uſe.—Salmon is caught in large quantities in the Eden, near Carliſle: it becomes in ſeaſon the beginning of December, but as it brings a high price in London, Mancheſter, &amp;c. few purchaſers are found here while it continues at about 2s. per lb. but as the ſeaſon advances, the prices drop; becauſe, in warm weather, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſent to a diſtance, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſold in the neighbourhood at about 3d. per pound. In the autumn ſalmon is generally cheapeſt, when ſeveral of the middling and lower claſſes of people ſalt and dry it: in that ſtate, we preſume, it affords a very unwholſome food, tending to occaſion ſcurvies and other impurities of the blood.</p>
                  <p>FUEL, is coal from Blenkinſop,
<note n="†" place="bottom">Blenkinſop is the property of a Mr. Coulſon.</note> Talkin, and Tindale-Fells, diſtant twenty, twelve, and fifteen miles to the eaſt, and are the property of the Earl of Carliſle. Coal from the firſt mentioned place has the preference. That article is brought from the pits to market in ſingle horſe carts,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0873500300:91"/>and diſpoſed of, neither by weight or meaſure, but by the cart load; conſequently a very diſcriminating eye is neceſſary to prevent being impoſed on.—Coals that are ſold by dealers, are commonly 5d. the Carliſle peck —Peats from Scaleby and Roweliff moſſes, diſtant five miles, ten for a penny.</p>
                  <p>PUBLIC INNS here have good accommodation, both in rooms and ſtabling.—The Buſh-Inn, Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, and Crown and Mitre, Caſtle ſtreet, are the houſes the mail-coaches put up at: the King's Arms, Grapes, Blue Bell, and Duke's Head, are alſo much reſorted to by travellers: there are ſeveral other good inns, both in the city and ſuburbs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Mail-Coaches and other public Carriages are numerous here.</hi>—Two mail-coaches ſet out every morning for London, one by Mancheſter and the other by Borrowbridge: a heavy coach is alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to the metropolis every Monday, Wedneſday, and Friday.—A mail-coach every afternoon to Glaſgow, and a mail diligence at the ſame time to Dumfries.—A diligence goes from this to Edinburgh every Monday, Wedneſday, and Friday; and to Newcaſtle on Sundays, Tueſdays, Wedneſdays, and Fridays; and one to Whitchaven on Saturdays—The arrivals are in proportion to their ſeveral diſtances.</p>
                  <p>WAGGONS AND CARTS for the conveyance of goods are exceeding numerous here, being the great thorough-fair between England and Scotland: in this branch of commerce there are above two hundred horſes employed: and as moſt of the goodsſtood in the public ſtreets during the market, great inconvenience was felt; now each are getting private warehouſes; and it is much to be wiſhed that a proper market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place was provided for the butchers, as their ſhambles greatly incommode the ſtreets.</p>
                  <p>LITERATURE.] In this department, Carliſle can boaſt of many literary productions; and, perhaps, there are few towns in this kingdom where literature has flouriſhed more than it has done here of late years.—We ſhall mention only the names of the authors and their works.</p>
                  <p>The Rev. W. Paley, D. D. Archdeacon of this dioceſe, publiſhed, while he reſided in this city, Moral and Political Philoſophy; Horae Paulinae; Reaſons for Contentment; a View of the Evidence of Chriſtianity, and Occaſional Sermons; all which works, as they poſſeſs a high degree of celebrity, ſo have been well received by a diſcerning public.—The Rev B. Griſdale, D. D. two occaſional ſermons. —The Rev. J. D. Carlyle, B. D. Chancellor of this dioceſe, Proſe and Poetical Tranſlations from the Arabic.—The Rev. R. Miln, A. M. diſſenting miniſter, Lectures upon the Antedeluvian World, and Occaſional Sermons.—The Rev. G. Thomſon, ditto, the Spirit of Modern Hiſtory, and Occaſional Sermons.—R. Harrington, M. D. ſeveral Treatiſes upon Air, Phlogiſton, &amp;c.—J. Heyſham, M. D. a Treatiſe upon the Jail Fever, Bills of Mortality, &amp;c.—Mark Lonſdale, poems, and pieces adapted for the theatre.</p>
                  <p>ARTS, SCIENCES, &amp;c.] Theſe have kept pace with the other improvements of this city.—Guy Head, an ingenious artiſt; who, from the years of infancy, manifeſted a ſtrong genius in painting and drawing; and to a fancy bold and vigorous, joined aſſiduity, rarely concentrated in one perſon. The talents of this gentleman are now likely to reflect honour on his native city, as he has been for ſome years reſident in Italy, for the purpoſe of ſtudying the excellent remains of the Italian maſters.—Robert Smirke, Eſq. R. A. hiſtorical painter, is a native of this county, and paſſed many of his juvenile years at Carliſle, where his father then reſided, he gave ſome proofs of that genius which has ſince placed him at the head of one of the moſt exalted departments of his profeſſion—Robert Carlyle excells in drawing antiquities and copying: his drawing of the cathedral of Carliſle, and other antiquities, are ſpecimens of his abilities this way, and do him credit, as they gained him the ſilver medal from the ſociety for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the arts, &amp;c.—James Lowes, a ſelf-taught draughts-man and engraver, whoſe firſt attempts as an artiſt, are coeval with the commencement of this hiſtory, and his improvement is to be traced in the work: we can always vouch for the accuracy, if not the elegance, of all his works.—John Howard, a native of this city, at preſent a teacher of Mathematics in Newcaſtle, is well known to all the lovers of that ſcience. He has the moſt extenſive knowledge of all the parts of mathematical learning, and is a ſelf-taught genius. Robert Bowman, a pupil of his, (blind from his infancy) is alſo a rare inſtance of genius: he is a perfect maſter of the higher branches of the mathematics.—Joſeph Strong, blind from his infancy, is a muſician and an artiſt: in the latter capacity he conſtructed a tolerable well toned organ, and is a great proficient in fancy-weaving. So true it is, that with a ſound judgment, a ready apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſtrong imagination, great progreſs may be made without ſight in the arts and ſciences.—Edward Foſter, clock-maker, has conſtructed a clock and planetarium, upon an extenſive and variegated ſcale. It is the production of twenty years' ſtudy and labour: its dimenſions are nine feet high, five feet broad, three feet deep; and conſiſts of four principal parts: 1ſt, It ſhews the ſeconds, minutes, and hours of the day; the faſts and feſtivals; the equation of time; the perpetual day of the month; the place of the moon's nodes, or the part of the ecliptic interſected by her orbit. 2d, The Copernic, or true ſolar ſyſtem

                  <p>1779. THE advantages which may be derived from accurate regiſters of mortality, are thus illuſtrated by an ingenious philoſopher and phyſician. <q>The eſtabliſhment of a judicious and accurate regiſter of the births and burials, in every town and pariſh, would be attended with the moſt important advantages, medical, political, and moral. By ſuch an inſtitution, the increaſe or decreaſe of certain diſeaſes; the comparative healthineſs of different ſituations, climates, and ſeaſons; the influence of particular trades and manufactures on longevity; with many other curious circumſtances, not more intereſting to phyſicians than beneficial to mankind, would be aſcertained with tolerable preciſion. In a political view, exact regiſters of human mortality are of ſtill greater conſequence, as the number of people, and progreſs of population in the kingdom, may, in the moſt eaſy and unexceptionable manner, be deduced from them. They are the foundation, likewiſe, of all calculations concerning the values of aſſurances on lives, reverſionary payments, and of every ſcheme for providing annuities for widows, and perſons in old age. In a moral light alſo, ſuch <hi>Tables</hi> are of evident utility, as the increaſe of vice or virtue may be determined, by obſerving the proportion which the diſeaſes ariſing from luxury, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and other ſimilar cauſes bear to the reſt; and in what particular places diſtempers of this claſs are found to be moſt fatal.</q>—<hi>Percival's Eſſays, vol.

                  <p>CARLISLE is ſituated in latitude 54, 55 north, and is ſurrounded by a wall about a mile and a quarter in circumference. The ſituation is rendered exceedingly pleaſant by its vicinity to three beautiful rivers, with which it is almoſt ſurrounded, viz. the Eden on the north eaſt ſide, Petteral on the ſouth eaſt, and Caldew on the north-weſt. The air about Carliſle is pure and dry, the ſoil chiefly ſand and clay. No marſhes or ſtagnant waters corrupt the atmoſphere; its neighbourhood to a branch of the ſea, and its due diſtance from the mountains on all ſides, render the air temperate and moderate.</p>
                  <p>In July 1763, at the requeſt of Dr. Littleton. Lord Biſhop of Carliſle, the inhabitants were numbered with great care and attention by the Rev. Mr. Richardſon, the Rev. Mr. Simpſon, and Mr. Alderman Hodgſon. There were at that time in the city and ſuburbs, 1059 families, and 4158 inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>In January 1780, a very careful and accurate ſurvey was made by Mr. Stanger and Mr. Howard, under my own inſpection. When there were in the diſtrict, before ſurveyed, 891 houſes, 1605 families, and 6299 inhabitants—For a more particular account of the ſurvey.—See Tables I. II. III.</p>
                  <p>This aſtoniſhing increaſe of 2141 inhabitants, which is above half of the original number, in the ſmall ſpace of ſeventeen years, may, in ſome meaſure, be attributed to the eſtabliſhment of manufactories.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0873500300:97"/>This increaſe of population too has taken place, during that very period in which Dr. Price aſſerts the depopulation of Great Britain to have been rapid and progreſſive: and what makes this increaſe more remarkable, Carliſle has, during the whole period alluded to, been conſtantly ſupplying the army, the navy, the metropolis, and even the diſtant regions of India, with her hardy, active, and enterprizing ſons.</p>
                  <p>From tables, number IV. V. and VI. we can with pleaſure demonſtrate the extreme ſalubrity of Carliſle, even in a very unhealthy year; a year in which no leſs than 129 perſons were cut off by two epidemic diſorders, viz. the ſmall pox and ſcarlet fever. By the bills of mortality publiſhed in different towns in England, as well as the continent, it appears on an average, that in Vienna about 1 in 19 and a half of the inhabitants die annually; in London, 1 in 20 and three quarters; in Edinburgh, 1 in 20 and four fifths; in Leeds, 1 in 21 and three fiſths; in Dublin, 1 in 22; in Rome, 1 in 23; in Amſterdam, 1 in 24; in Breſlaw, 1 in 25; in Berlin, 1 in 26 and a half, in Northampton and Shrewſbury, 1 in 26 and a half; in Liverpool, 1 in 27 and a half; in Mancheſter, 1 in 28; in Cheſter, 1 in 40; but in the year 1774, when the ſmall pox were very general and fatal, 1 in 27; and in the pariſh of Sedburgh, in the county of York, 1 in 37 and a half; and in Blandford Forum in Dorſet, 1 in 39; in Carliſle, this year, 1 in 30 and three ninths—See Table VII.</p>
                  <p>Tables, number III. V. and VI. are of the utmoſt importance to the phyſician, the politician, and the calculator of annuities, and to every one who has the health and happineſs of himſelf and family at heart. They clearly demonſtrate, as far as one year's obſervation can have weight, what periods of life are the moſt healthy, what are the moſt obnoxious to diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>As no particular epidemic diſeaſe occurred laſt year, which had any conſiderable effect on the lives of adult perſons, it is apprehended theſe calculations for the periods above ten years old, will not be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much variation in other years.</p>
                  <p>That women in general live longer than men, is almoſt univerſally agreed, and the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tend much to confirm the truth of this opinion. During the laſt year twelve perſons died between eighty and ninety years old, eight of theſe were females, and between ninety and a hundred, two died, both females.—See table VI. In table III. we ſee two people are above 100 years old, and theſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are females.</p>
                  <p>Table II. which contains the number of huſbands, wives, &amp;c. ſhews how inferior in number widowers are to widows. There are above four widows to one widower: an aſtoniſhing diſproportion; in what manner is it to be accounted for? The following cauſes are conceived to operate conſiderably:</p>
                  <p>1ſt, Men are, in general, more intemperate than women. 2d, They are expoſed to greater hardſhips and dangers. 3d, Widowers, perhaps, in general, have greater opportunities of getting wives, than wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows have of getting huſbands. 4th, Widows have a greater propenſity to live in towns than widowers.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Women, in general, and more eſpecially among the middle ranks of life, marry earlier than men.</note> 5th and laſtly, The conſtitutions of males, as fitted for more violent and laborious exertions, are firmer and more robuſt than thoſe of females: their muſcular and nervous fibres, may therefore be ſuppoſed to become ſtiff, rigid, and incapable of performing the functions neceſſary to health and life ſooner than thoſe of females, both on account of their original texture, and the friction which muſt neceſſarily occur from laborious exerciſe. But from whatever cauſes the difference of longevity betwixt males and females may ariſe, the fact itſelf is ſufficiently aſcertained by table VI. where we find, that between the ages of ſixty and ſeventy, although there are a greater number of wives than huſbands, yet eleven huſbands and only four wives have died, and of all different ages twenty-nine huſbands and ſixteen wives.</p>
                  <p>During this year two epidemics raged with uncommon violence, and ſwept off a great number of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, viz. the ſmall pox, and a ſpecies of the ſcarlet fever.</p>
                  <p>As the perſons affected with the ſmall pox were chiefly of the lower claſs, who ſeldom called in medical aſſiſtance, it is impoſſible to aſcertain the preciſe number: from the information, however, which I have had, it appears, that about 300 were, during the laſt ſix months of the year, ſeized with the ſmall pox in the natural way: of theſe no leſs than ninety fell victims to its virulence. Hence, near one in three died of all that were affected with the natural ſmall pox; which, while at the ſame time, it ſerves as a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly proof of its fatal effects, points out the great and ſalutary advantages which are derived from ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. During the ſame period ſeveral hundreds were inoculated in the neighbourhood of Carliſle, and it is a pleaſing truth, that not one of them died. Had thoſe 300 been inoculated, it is more than probable, that of the ninety not above ſix would have died; and even theſe not of inoculation, but of other diſorders. Hence we ſee eighty-four perſons might have been ſaved to their parents and the public. Yet ſo great is the prejudice againſt the ſalutary practice of inoculation amongſt the vulgar, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0873500300:98"/>few, very few, can be prevailed upon, either by promiſes, rewards, or intreaties, to ſubmit to the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No wonder, that in rude, ignorant, and barbarous times, ſuperſtition hurried men into the groſſeſt abſurdities; when in a poliſhed and enlightened age, in an age too, when the experience of full twenty years has clearly demonſtrated the utility of inoculation, we ſee the bulk of mankind ready to ſacrifice their children, and all that is dear to them, to a fooliſh prejudice.</p>
                  <p>FOR THE YEAR 1780.] The population of Great Britain muſt ever be a ſubject deſerving the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every lover of his country, and eſpecially ſince the commencement of the preſent war, it has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come highly intereſting.</p>
                  <p>Within theſe few years, ſome very able writers have publiſhed their thoughts and calculations on this ſubject. Thoſe who are willing to depreciate the reſources of this country, and to magnify thoſe of our enemies, have endeavoured to perſuade us, that our ſituation is truly lamentable, and that population has rapidly and progreſſively decreaſed for this twenty or thirty years paſt.</p>
                  <p>The data from which theſe calculations and inferences have been made, are principally the returns of the window ſurveyors, and the books of the cuſtoms and exciſe.</p>
                  <p>Others, who from different ſources of information, have attempted to confute ſuch ſentiments, have preſented us with a more favourable picture; they, with much appearance of truth, have endeavoured to prove, that the number of inhabitants in Great Britain, inſtead of decreaſing, has conſiderably increaſed, during the period above alluded to. In ſupport of the latter hypotheſis, I think it may not be improper to mention the following facts:—</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the year 1780, I made an actual, and I believe an accurate, ſurvey of the two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's, and found they contained 1148 houſes, 1872 families, and 7677 inhabitants
<note n="†" place="bottom">See laſt year's obſervations on the bills of mortality for Carliſle.</note> A few months afterwards, another actual ſurvey was made of the two pariſhes, by Mr. Coulſon, general ſurveyor of the four northern counties for the window-tax, and Mr. William Monkhouſe, ſurveyor of Cumberland, Leith, and Eſkdale wards; and though I have every reaſon to apprehend, that their ſurvey was much more accurate, than ſurveys for the window-tax heretofore have been, yet they only returned 815 houſes; the difference therefore between the real number of houſes, and the number returned to the window-tax is 333. Now, to ſhew how fallacious all calculations are, with reſpect to the number of inhabitants in any particular place, founded on the returns of the ſurveyors of the window-tax, even when they make the moſt accurate ſurvey. Let us ſuppoſe I had wanted to aſcertain the number of inhabitants in Carliſle and the adjoining villages, and had been ignorant of the real number of houſes which they contained, I ſhould have multiplied 815 by 6 and two thirds, which is nearly the number of people in each houſe, the product will be 5433 nearly, which is 2244 leſs than the real number or two ſevenths nearly of the whole. And if I had been ignorant of the number of inhabitants in each houſe, I ſhould moſt probably have multiplied 815 by 6, which would have made the difference ſtill more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
                  <p>The ſalubrity of Carliſle was proved by the bills of mortality publiſhed laſt year; and it appears ſtill more evident from the preſent, for only 1 in 34 and a half nearly, of all the inhabitants have died this year, in conſequence of diſeaſes—See Table VII.</p>
                  <p>Table VI. coroborates the obſervations made in the laſt year's bills, viz. that women live longer than men; for between 100 and 103 years old, two perſons died, who were both females; 26 huſbands, and only 15 wives have died, although there are a greater number of wives than huſbands in Carliſle.</p>
                  <p>FOR THE YEAR 1781.] People of all ranks, ages, and conditions of life, enjoyed an uncommon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of health during the firſt three months of this year; for, within that period, no more than twenty-three perſons died; and of theſe, fifteen were either very young children, or old and infirm. But about the beginning of April, a very epidemic fever, evidently the <hi>Typhus Carcerum,</hi> began to make its appearance. It broke out in a houſe in Rickergate, which contains about half a dozen very poor families; the rooms are exceeding ſmall, and in order to diminiſh the window-tax, every window, that even poverty could diſpenſe with, was ſhut up: hence ſtagnation of air, which was rendered ſtill more noxious by the filth and uncleanlineſs of the people. The ſurgeon who attended ſome of thoſe poor wretches, told me, the ſmell was ſo offenſive and diſagreeable, that it was with difficulty he could ſtay in the houſe, while he inquired into the ſituation of his patient. One of the perſons affected with the fever in this houſe was a weaver, who, on his recovary, went to his uſual employment at a large work-ſhop, where he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the diſorder to his fellow-weavers, and from thence the fever ſpread all over the town. It, however, chiefly. I may almoſt ſay entirely, raged amongſt the common and lower ranks of people, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt thoſe who lived in narrow, cloſe, confined lanes, and in ſmall, crowded apartments. It
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0873500300:99"/>affected adults more frequently than children; the infirm, than the robuſt; women than men; and the married were more ſubject to it than the ſingle. Three or four perſons in a family were frequently ſeized with it, one after another. It was almoſt altogether confined to this place, none being ſeized with it ever in the neighbouring villages, except in a very few inſtances, where the feeds of it were evidently carried by ſome perſons who had laboured under the diſeaſe. In the ſhort ſpace of about eight months, near five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons were affected with this fever, forty-eight of whom died; of theſe, one was under five years o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſmall pox were conſtantly in town all this year, but made little or no progreſs till towards th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> as an epidemic: nineteen only died. No other epidemic appeared, and indeed, excepting the jail fever this year was by no means unhealthy. Great numbers were inoculated both in the town and country villages.</p>
                  <p>During the preſent year, 1 in 38 and 3 fifths of all the inhabitants have died in conſequence of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes—See Table VII.</p>
                  <p>The difference of the number of deaths of huſbands and wives, is not near ſo great as it was in the years 1779 and 1780; yet ſtill the deaths of the former exceed thoſe of the latter by two; for thirty three huſbands and only thirty-one wives have died, which difference is not the leſs extraordinary than i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the two preceding years, when we conſider, in the firſt place, that the conſtitutions of women are more prediſpoſed to be acted upon by the contagion of the Jail Fever than thoſe of men; and in the ſecond that they are, from their habits and ſituations in life, infinitely more expoſed to that contagion. Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and four females, and between ninety and an hundred, three females have died.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>FOR THE YEAR 1782.] Upon the whole, this year, notwithſtanding it was ſo extremely cold and wet cannot be conſidered as an unhealthy one. The <hi>Typhus Carcerum,</hi> or <hi>Jail Fever,</hi> which raged with ſo much violence laſt year, gradually declined, and was ſcarcely to be met with after May. Sixteen perſons died of it.</p>
                  <p>And although the ſmall pox were conſtantly in town, yet they were neither general nor very fatal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thirty perſons only died of that diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of June, the <hi>Catarrhus Contagioſus</hi> or <hi>Influenza</hi> became general; very few families either in the town or country, eſcaping its influence. It is, perhaps, the moſt contagious of all diſorders to which the human body is ſubject; and were it as fatal as it is infectious, it would ſoon depopulate the world. When it once breaks out, it does not, like the ſmall pox, the plague, or the jail fever, confine itſelf to a city, a province, or a kingdom; but traverſes whole continents, and is ſometimes wafted acroſs the Atlantic Ocean. It has raged no leſs than eleven or twelve times as an epidemic in Europe, within the preſent century, and pretty generally exhibits the ſame phoenomena; yet no barrier has hitherto been diſcovered to arreſt its progreſs; nor have the cauſes which firſt produced it at each period, been yet aſcertained. Fortunately, however, it is a very mild diſeaſe, differing little from the common catarrh or cold, except that the febrile ſymptoms are more conſtant and rather more ſevere. The Influenza attacked every age, ſex, and apparently people of every habit; yet it is evident, a prediſpoſition was required, as ſeveral, and among the reſt myſelf, who were frequently expoſed to the contagion, eſcaped the diſeaſe. In what that prediſpoſition conſiſts, remains yet to be diſcovered. It finiſhed its courſe in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Carliſle, in about the ſpace of three weeks or a month; and its ſymptoms were here ſo mild, that medical advice was ſeldom ſought for. One perſon only is ſuppoſed to have died of it in Carliſle, viz. a woman ſixty-five years of age. During this year 1 in 38 of all the inhabitants have died in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of diſeaſes.—See Table VII.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto the number of deaths of huſbands, has conſiderably exceeded thoſe of wives, each year: but during the preſent year, the deaths of wives ſomewhat exceed; for twenty-two wives, and only twenty huſbands have died.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and nine females; and between ninety and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, one male and two females have died; between a hundred and one, and a hundred and two years of age, one female, viz a widow, died during the preſent year.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>In the month of Auguſt not one perſon died in the pariſh of St. Cuthbert, a circumſtance which has not occurred theſe twenty years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0873500300:100"/>FOR THE YEAR 1783.] The preſent year has been much more healthy, than any of the preceding years; on which, obſervations on the bills of mortality in Carliſle have been made: for, notwithſtanding the number of inhabitants has conſiderably increaſed, yet the number of deaths is by no means ſo great, one hundred and eighty one perſons only have died.</p>
                  <p>No dangerous or fatal epidemic, except the ſmall pox, raged with any degree of violence.—The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, during the latter end of June, the whole of July, and part of Auguſt, was extremely hot and ſultry; the atmoſphere was replete with the electric fluid; and there was more thunder and lightening than ever was remembered, even by the oldeſt perſon. This ſtate of the atmoſphere was by no means peculiar to the neighbourhood of Carliſle, but was pretty univerſal throughout Europe.</p>
                  <p>In September and October, the ſmall pox became ſo general, and were of ſo fatal a kind, that the monthly committee of the diſpenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry were of opinion, that a general inoculation of the poor and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent inhabitants, would be attended with very beneficial effects. Early in the month of November, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral inoculation accordingly took place. Great numbers were inoculated, not only by the ſurgeon to the diſpenſary, but alſo by moſt of the other ſurgeons in the town. By this ſalutary meaſure the city of Carliſle was, in the ſpace of two months, totally freed from a moſt dangerous and fatal diſorder which has been raging in different parts of the county with the utmoſt violence. The number of perſons affected with the natural ſmall pox in Whitehaven, within the laſt ſix months, have been almoſt incredible, and it is a melancholy truth, that ſcarcely one in three ſurvived. In Wigton and its neighbourhood they have been alſo extremely general and fatal.</p>
                  <p>Twenty nine huſbands and twenty three wives have died this year.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>Between eighty and ninety years of age, four males and ſeven females, ſix of whom were widows; and between ninety and an hundred, one male and one female have died.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>Nineteen only fell victims to the ſmall pox, and ſeventeen of theſe were children under five years of age.</p>
                  <p>A poplexies were remarkably frequent this year; no leſs than nine perſons having died of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper.—The number of deaths were remarkably equal during all the ſeaſons; forty-ſeven died in winter, forty-two in the ſpring, forty five in the ſummer, and forty-ſeven in autumn.—See Table IV.</p>
                  <p>During the preſent year, 1 in 43 and 1-7th of all the inhabitants have died in conſequence of diſeaſes. —See Table VII.</p>
                  <p>FOR THE YEAR 1784.] In the obſervations on the bills of mortality for laſt year, I took notice of the extreme healthineſs of that ſeaſon; it is, however, with peculiar ſatisfaction I am able to inform the public, that it has been far exceeded in ſalubrity by the preſent.</p>
                  <p>One hundred and fifty-four perſons only have died, which are fewer by twenty-ſeven than died laſt year; and in the year 1779, the number ſwept off by two diſeaſes only, viz. the ſmall pox and ſcarlet fever was nearly equal to the whole number of deaths this year, whether occaſioned by diſeaſes or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                  <p>This remarkable degree of healthineſs may be accounted for, from the abſence of almoſt all epidemical diſorders; for not one made its appearance except the ſmall pox, which were of a very mild kind, and proved fatal to no more than ten perſons, nine of whom were under five years of age. How to account for the abſence of all other epidemic and contagious diſeaſes, is not ſo eaſy.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the weather, I ſhall only remark that the preſent year commenced and ended with the ſevereſt and longeſt continued froſts ever remembered ſince the year 1740. The ſummer too was uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cold and wet, and yet was the healthieſt ſeaſon, as may be ſeen by examining table IV.</p>
                  <p>Whether the ſeverity of the froſt had any effect in purifying the air, and hence rendering it unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the propagation, &amp;c. &amp;c. of epidemical diſorders, perhaps, may be doubted; but it certainly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated moſt powerfully in the production of an obſtinate cutaneous diſeaſe, by phyſicians denominated, Herpes; but by the common people and empiries, called Scurvy, though it is eſſentially different from that diſorder.</p>
                  <p>This cutaneous complaint, viz. Herpes, has been extremely prevalent, and remarkably obſtinate theſe two laſt winters, and has appeared under a variety of forms.</p>
                  <p>The number of deaths of huſbands ſtill continues to exceed that of wives, and this year in a very great proportion, for twenty nine huſbands have died, but only twenty wives.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>Four widowers, and twenty-four widows have died.</p>
                  <p>Between eighty and ninety years of age, four males and nine females, eight of whom were widows; and between ninety and an hundred, one male and three females have died.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto the number of males born has exceeded the number of females; but this year it is the reverſe, for 121 males and 153 females have been chriſtened.—See Table VIII.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0873500300:101"/>During this year, 1 in 50 and 1-6th nearly, of all the inhabitants have died in conſequence of diſeaſes. —See Table VII.</p>
                  <p>FOR THE YEAR 1785.] The preſent year, like the laſt, was uſhered in by a very ſevere and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued froſt. There was alſo a conſiderable fall of ſnow; and a complete thaw, which was ſlow, gradual, and without rain, did not take place till near the middle of April. The thaw was ſucceeded by cold eaſterly winds, which continued a long time; and a greater degree of drought was ſcarcely ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered. The fields were parched, the ſprings and rivers were almoſt dried up, circumſtances not to be wondered at, when we conſider that there was no rain, a very few ſlight ſhowers excepted, from the month of October, 1784, till the 29th of July. On that day we had, in the neighbourhood of Carliſle, a great deal of thunder and lightning, accompanied by a moſt violent and heavy rain; and from that time, till near the end of the year, the weather became moiſt and warm.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this long continued drought, the weather was never exceedingly hot or ſultry; which may probably be the reaſon why dangerous diſorders were not more prevalent. For this year was far from being unhealthy, no epidemic diſeaſes occurring, but ſuch as had ariſen before the dry and warm ſeaſon came on; which, therefore, could have no effect in producing them.</p>
                  <p>Very early in the month of January, the jail fever, which I believe firſt originated among the felons confined in the jail, began to make its appearance in the city, and continued to rage almoſt the whole of the year. As the pooreſt claſs of inhabitants chiefly ſuffered from it: its progreſs, &amp;c. will be beſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained by examining the books of the diſpenſary, where I find four patients, labouring under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, were admitted in the month of January; four in February; four in March; three in April; eight in May; eight in June; ten in July: fifteen in Auguſt; nineteen in September; eleven in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and eleven in November. In December it ſeems to have almoſt entirely ceaſed, for not one was admitted during that month. Ninety-ſeven patients, affected with this fever, were therefore admitted into the diſpenſary in the ſpace of eleven months.</p>
                  <p>The preſent epidemic was of the ſame nature as that which appeared at Carliſle in the year 1781, and of which I publiſhed an account. It, however, differed in ſome few particulars, which difference I ſhall briefly relate. 1. It did not rage ſo univerſally, the contagion, probably, not being ſo virulent. 2. The ſymptoms, in general, were more mild. 3. Petechiae and haemorrhages were ſeldom obſerved. 4. A greater proportion of children were affected. 5. Relapſes were much more frequent. In the fever of 1781, I did not ſee one inſtance of a relapſe; whereas in the preſent, it was a very common circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſeveral patients having even two relapſes.</p>
                  <p>Of the ninety-ſeven patients labouring under this fever, and which were admitted into the diſpenſary, only four have died, who were all in extreme danger at the time of their admiſſion, and two of them ſo much exhauſted, as not to be able almoſt to take any medicine: viz. Margaret Storey, of Rickergate, a married woman, aged forty-two years, who died on the third day after admiſſion; and Mary Wilſon, of Nanſon's lane, a child, aged three years, who died two days after admiſſion. If we, therefore, omit theſe two, as caſes already deſperate, ninety-five will remain, of which only two died, which is exactly one in forty-ſeven and one half. A circumſtance which ſtrongly marks the efficacy of the practice, and more eſpecially when it is conſidered, that almoſt the whole of theſe patients were confined, during their illneſs, in ſmall, cloſe, dirty rooms, where, in ſome caſes, ſix perſons were ill at the ſame time; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even three of them in one bed.</p>
                  <p>In the whole city nine perſons died of this fever.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude this part of my ſubject, I cannot omit obſerving that the diſpenſary has expended upwards of thirty pounds for wine, all of which was conſumed by perſons affected with this diſouſe.</p>
                  <p>Early in the month of December, 1784, the ſmall pox were introduced by ſome vagrants, into the Damſide, Iriſh Gates, to the neighbourhood of which they were confined ſome time, but afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came general, and continued till the latter end of July, or beginning of Auguſt, when they entirely ceaſed. Eight patients affected with the natural ſmall pox were admitted into the diſpenſary in the month of January; eight in February; two in March; twenty-one in April; nine in May; and four in July; in all fifty-two; twelve of whom died. Total of deaths of this diſeaſe, thirty-nine, who were all under five years of age.</p>
                  <p>As one in four and one third died of all thoſe who were admitted into the diſpenſary, it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that of the whole number who laboured under the natural ſmall pox, many of whom had not the leaſt advice or aſſiſtance, one in four would die, which makes the number affected, one hundred and fifty-ſix. As ſoon as the diſeaſe made its appearance within the walls of the city, the monthly committee of the diſpenſary reſolved, that a general inoculation of the poor inhabitants, agreeable to the plan which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0873500300:102"/>I had propoſed in the year 1783,
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>The ſmall pox, both natural and from inoculation, being now pretty general in Carliſle, and likely to ſpread ſtill further, the monthly committee of the Carliſle Diſpenſary are of opinion, that a general inoculation of the poor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent inhabitants will be attended with very beneficial effects.</p>
                        <p n="1">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> ſhould take place at the diſpenſary, and it was with great pleaſure I obſerved the prejudices of the vulgar againſt that moſt ſalutary invention, were greatly diminiſhed. For as ſoon as the reſolution of the committee was made public by the common crier, great numbers from all quarters of the town flocked to the diſpenſary, to reap the benefits which it held out to them. No leſs than ninety one were inoculated at the expence of the charity, and rather more than that number by the different practitioners. So that upon a moderate calculation, the whole number inoculated this year, amounted to two hundred; every one of whom not only recovered, but had the diſeaſe in a very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner. As we have ſtated it as probable, that one in four died of the natural ſmall pox, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore probable that fifty lives were ſaved by this general inoculation; and if all thoſe affected in the natural way had been alſo inoculated, no leſs than eighty-nine lives would have been preſerved.</p>
                  <p>During this year, 1 in 37 and 1-7th nearly, of all the inhabitants have died—See Table VII.</p>
                  <p>Apoplexies and paralytic ſtrokes were very frequent: no leſs than eight ſuffered from the apoplexy.</p>
                  <p>As uſual the number of deaths of huſbands continues to exceed that of wives; twenty-nine huſbands have died, and only twenty-five wives.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>Nine widowers, and twenty-one widows have died this year.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>Perſons between the ages of ten and fifteen, and fifteen and twenty years, have been aſtoniſhingly healthy, When I made the ſurvey of Carliſle in the beginning of the year 1780, there were between ten and fifteen, ſeven hundred and fifteen; and between fifteen and twenty years of age, ſix hundred and ſeventy-five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: in all, one thouſand three hundred and ninety. Since that period the inhabitants have unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably increaſed much: it is therefore very probable, that at preſent there are not leſs than one thouſand four hundred and fifty perſons between the age of ten and twenty years, and yet of this number only two have died.—See Table V.</p>
                  <p>The preſent year, however, ſeems to have been fatal to old people, between eighty and ninety years of age, eight males and ſix females, five of whom were widows; and between ninety and an hundred, two males and four females have died.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>The number of males born greatly exceed the number of females; for, 148 males, and 119 females have been chriſtened.—See Table VIII.</p>
                  <p>FOR THE YEAR 1786.] Although we had not nearly ſo much froſt this year as the laſt, yet in other reſpects, the weather, during the preſent ſpring and ſummer, greatly reſembled that of the year 1785. The winds, which were dry and cold, came chiefly from the eaſt during the whole of the months of March, April, and a part of May, which made the ſpring late: and although the drought which ſucceeded was not of equal duration, yet it was much more intenſe, and conſequently the fields exhibited the ſame parched and arid appearance they had done the laſt ſummer. Refreſhing rains fell towards the middle of July: the autumn was fine; and a more mild and open winter was ſeldom or ever remembered.</p>
                  <p>There was ſcarcely any difference in the ſalubrity of the two years, two hundred and four perſons dying the laſt, and two hundred and five in the preſent year. June, July, and Auguſt, which were the hotteſt months, were by far the moſt healthy, for only twenty-four perſons died during that period.—See Table IV.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, October, November, and December, were the moſt unhealthy, during which eighty-three deaths occurred: See Table IV.—This difference, however, did not ſeem to proceed from any alteration of the atmoſphere, but from the meaſles, which were introduced into the town ſome time in Auguſt, and raged, during theſe three months, with the greateſt violence.</p>
                  <p>About two o'clock on Friday morning, Auguſt 11th, a ſlight ſhock of an earthquake was very ſenſibly felt by many perſons in Carliſle and the neighbourhood. Thoſe who were perfectly awake, or who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be out of doors, report that the concuſſion continued about four or five ſeconds; and that it was immediately preceded by a hollow tremulous ſound. Many were awakened out of their ſleep, by the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0873500300:103"/>ſhaking of their houſes, beds, doors, and window ſhutters. Birds in cages were likewiſe ſenſible of its influence, and fluttered as if greatly agitated and alarmed. Very providentially, however, little or no damage was ſuſtained; a few chimneys and old walls were here and there thrown down, and three people in Whitehaven were thrown off their feet. But in other reſpects, a momentary fright and alarm were the only inconveniences which were ſuffered from it. The concuſſion ſeemed to take its direction from the eaſt to the weſt, and extended quite acroſs the iſland, being felt both at Neweaſtle and Whitehaven. And from the north towards the ſouth, it extended from Glaſgow to the northern parts of Lancaſhire. The atmoſphere on Wedneſday and Thurſday preceding, was moiſt, gloomy, and ſultry; and ſo much ſo, on Thurſday night, that a lady, who was on a viſit at Dalſton, actually foretold when ſhe went to bed, that an earthquake would take place before morning. Friday was a very clear, hot, calm, ſultry, day.</p>
                  <p>Early in the ſpring, the meaſles made their appearance in the ſouth-weſt parts of Northumberland, where, I am informed, they proved very fatal. From thence they gradually advanced farther ſouth, and the infection began to operate in Carliſle about the beginning of Auguſt: and as this epidemic had not viſited us ſince the year 1780, there muſt conſequently have been a great number of children who were liable to be affected by the contagious matter generated by this diſorder. Hence the infection ſpread rapidly, and the diſeaſe ſoon became general, and continued to rage till the latter end of December, or beginning of January, 1787, when it altogether diſappeared.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, however, the diſorder was ſo very general, yet its ſymptoms were extremely mild and favourable: for, of the great number who were affected, I ſhould ſuppoſe not leſs than ſix or ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, only twenty-eight died, and the greater part of theſe were the children of the very pooreſt and loweſt claſs of inhabitants, who were either too ignorant, or too obſtinate to call in medical aſſiſtance. Of the twenty-eight who died, twenty-ſix were under five years of age, and two were between five and ten years old.</p>
                  <p>Another epidemic, viz. the chincough, occurred pretty early in the year, but this diſeaſe made little progreſs, until October, and even then did not become very general. Only nine children, who were all under five years of age, died of it, and ſome of thoſe were affected with the chincough and meaſles at the ſame time, and therefore probably ſuffered from the joint effects of both.</p>
                  <p>During the preſent year, 1 in 37 and 5-6ths nearly, of all the inhabitants died in conſequence of diſeaſes.—See Table VII.</p>
                  <p>The number of deaths of huſbands ſtill continues to exceed that of wives; twenty-four huſbands have died, and only twenty-one wives.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>Between eighty and ninety years of age, one male and five females, who were all widows; and between ninety and an hundred, two widows have died.</p>
                  <p>A man who had long been a ſoldier, and who muſt conſequently have been ſubject to many varieties and viciſſitudes of life, died at the advanced age of 105.</p>
                  <p>FOR THE YEAR 1787.] In the beginning of January, 1780, the inhabitants of the two pariſhes of St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's, Carliſle, were very accurately numbered by Mr. Stanger, Mr. Howard, and myſelf. At that period theſe pariſhes contained 3491 males, and 4186 females, in all 7677.</p>
                  <p>Sometime in the year 1787, an order was iſſued from the court of Quarter Seſſions, to the different conſtables in the county of Cumberland, to make an actual ſurvey of all the inhabitants of the county. The ſurvey was accordingly made at Carliſle in the latter end of December; but, as the motives which induced the magiſtrates to iſſue this order were not generally known, many gentlemen refuſed to give an account of their families. The abbey, as being extraparochial, and the townſhip of Wreay, through ſome miſtake, were altogether omitted in this ſurvey: hence it is evident, the liſts delivered in to the Quarter Seſſions are very erroneous.</p>
                  <p>I, however, had an opportunity of examining all the returns of the above pariſhes very minutely, and as the conſtables marked down the names of all thoſe perſons who refuſed to give them information, I was enabled to make up the deficiency, by procuring the numbers in each of their families, and I am perſuaded the enumeration is now pretty exact; but if there be any error, it will be on the ſide of defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, rather than of exceſs.</p>
                  <p>From this ſurvey, thus corrected, it appears that the two pariſhes of St. Mary's and St. Cutbbert's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contain at preſent 3864 males, 4813 females, and conſequently 8677 inhabitants.—For a more particular account ſee Table III.</p>
                  <p>There has therefore been an increaſe, in the ſpace of eight years, of a thouſand inhabitants; which is a circumſtance, that muſt give great pleaſure to all thoſe who are well-wiſhers to the proſperity of the city of Carliſle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0873500300:104"/>From what cauſes, it may be aſked, has this rapid increaſe ariſen? It affords me conſiderable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to be able to inform the public, that it has principally been owing to two general cauſes, viz. <hi>The ſalubrity of the place, and the increaſe of trade and manufactures.</hi> The former is clearly proved by the great exceſs of births above deaths; for, during the laſt eight years, the period in queſtion, 2071 children have been baptized, and only 1582 perſons have been buried. The births, therefore, exceed the deaths 489. The latter, viz. <hi>the increaſe of trade and manufactures,</hi> is proved by an ingreſs of inhabitants into Carliſle, exceeding the emigration out of it, during the ſame period, 511; which numbers together make up the increaſe of 1000.</p>
                  <p>Inoculation, I am perſuaded, has alſo greatly contributed to the increaſe of population, not only in Carliſle, but likewiſe in the whole county of Cumberland. In the year 1779, when the lower claſs of inhabitants were extremely averſe to this ſalutary diſcovery, no fewer than ninety perſons died of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſmall pox; whereas only 151 have died during the eight ſucceeding years; which is, upon an ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, not quite nineteen in each year; and yet that diſorder prevailed in every one of theſe years. (See all the bills of mortality which have been publiſhed.) Since that period, viz. 1779, the prejudices of the vulgar againſt inoculation, have greatly diminiſhed, and will ſoon, I doubt not, be totally eradicated. And ſince the inſtitution of the diſpenſary, the poor have enjoyed the privilege of having their children inoculated gratis; an advantage which they have, in general, with great readineſs embraced.</p>
                  <p>The firſt four months of the preſent year, greatly reſembled the beginning of the year 1779. The weather in both was remarkably mild and temperate, for there was ſcarce any froſt in either. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon daiſy was in full flower on new-year's-day, and continued in bloſſom almoſt the whole year: the Primroſe began to blow on the 1ſt of February: and the Colt's-foot and Barren Strawberry very early in the ſame month: in ſhort, all the early flowering plants were in full blow five or ſix weeks before their uſual time. The ſtate of the weather, however, throughout the year, was the reverſe of 1785 and 1786; theſe years were remarkably hot and dry; this was cold, gloomy, and uncommonly wet, inſomuch that there never was a year in which, probably, more rain fell than in the preſent.</p>
                  <p>The late Dr. Carlyle kept an accurate account of the quantity of rain which fell at Carliſle during a period of twenty years, viz. from the year 1757 to 1776 incluſive, which his ſon, the Rev. Mr. Chancellor Carlyle, has been kind enough to communicate to me. During this period, the greateſt quantity which fell in any one year, was thirty-one inches and a few lines; and the medium depth of theſe years was only twenty four inches, eight lines and a half. Unfortunately, ſince 1776, no regular meaſure has been taken at Carliſle; but Dr. Campbell, a very ingenious phyſician at Lancaſter, has ſent me a table of the quantity which fell at that place during the preſent year; and from which it appears, that it amounted to the almoſt incredible quantity of fifty-one inches and one line. The rain, therefore, which fell this year, is conſiderably above double the quantity which has fallen in any one year, on an average of twenty year's calculation, and exceeds, in quantity, twenty inches what fell in the weteſt of the above years. It muſt, however, be obſerved, that Lancaſter is ſituated ſomewhat nearer the weſtern ocean than Carliſle; and that the hills to the eaſt and north-eaſt of that place, are nearer it than the hills about Carliſle, which, in all probability, will make ſome difference in the quantity of rain which falls at each place.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the very great moiſture of the atmoſphere, above related, yet the preſent year was a healthy one, and the laſt ſix months were remarkably ſo; ſeventy-three perſons only died during that period.—See Table IV.</p>
                  <p>The ſmall pox made their appearance in January, and were in Carliſle the greateſt part of the year; but inoculation ſoon became general, which prevented the diſorder from raging with any great degree of violence Thirty only died, twenty-eight of whom were under five years of age, and two between five and ten years. Eighty-four were inoculated at the diſpenſary, all of whom not only ſurvived, but had the diſorder very favourably; and conſiderable numbers were likewiſe inoculated by ſeveral ſurgeons in the town.</p>
                  <p>The putrid or jail fever alſo prevailed almoſt the whole year; but as it neither became general, nor malignant, till the beginning of 1788, I ſhall at preſent only obſerve, that fourteen perſons fell victims to it.</p>
                  <p>The difference in the number of deaths of huſbands and wives is this year very conſiderable; for thirty-four huſbands have died, and only twenty two wives.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and five females, (the latter were widows;) and between ninety and one hundred, one male and two females have died.—See Table VI.</p>
                  <p>During the preſent year, only 1 in 44 nearly, of all the inhabitants have died in conſequence of diſeaſes;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0873500300:105"/>and upon an average of the laſt nine years 1 in 39 and 1-4th has died.—See Table VII. It muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked in the firſt place, that every infectious and epidemic diſeaſe, to which the human body is ſubject, (the plague excepted) prevailed during this period at Carliſle; and in the ſecond place, that the calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made for the firſt eight years: from the number of inhabitants which exiſted in the beginning of the year 1780, the great increaſe (of one thouſand) not being aſcertained till the preſent year 1787. Therefore, although the deaths from accidents were not taken into the account for ſeveral of the firſt years; yet, upon the whole, the mortality is ſtated to be greater than it actually is.—See Table VII.</p>
                  <p>The deaths which occurred from accidents, were, in 1779, four; in 1780, three; in 1781, five; in 1782, four; in 1783, three; in 1784, five; in 1785, four; in 1786, two; and in 1787, two.</p>
                  <p>From table VII. it appears that the moſt healthy period of human life is from ten to fifteen years of age, and that health declines in the following order, viz. between 20 and 30,—15 and 20,— 5 and 10,—30 and 40,—40 and 50,—50 and 60,—60 and 70,—under 5,—70 and 80,—80 and 90,—90 and 100. —See Table VII.</p>
                  <p>Table VIII. gives a connected view of all the chriſtenings and burials from 1779 to 1796, incluſive.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Heyſham's tables of deaths and diſeaſes of perſons of different ages are omitted, as wholly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to medical ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude the obſervations on the bills of mortality, with an account of a very curious and important circumſtance in phyſiology, which occurred at Carliſle during the preſent year. A child was born, apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the full time, not only alive, but which lived and took nouriſhment ſeveral days, without the ſmalleſt veſtige of a brain. In all my reading I do not recollect to have met with ſo extraordinary a phenomenon; nor does it appear that Profeſſor Monro, who has ſpent the greateſt part of his time in anatomical and phyſiological purſuits, has either ſeen or read of any thing exactly ſimilar. He has indeed, in his inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious obſervations on the ſtructure and functions of the nervous ſyſtem, publiſhed in 1783, favoured the world with ſome plates, which repreſent the heads of two children, born at the full time, in which the bones which generally form the top of the cranium are wanting, and in which the brain, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſmall, projects like an excreſcence. In theſe two inſtances, however, there was a ſmall portion of brain in each, and though both the children are ſtated to have been born at the full time, yet it does not appear that they were even born alive, much leſs that they lived any time after birth; for, if either had been the caſe, we cannot ſuppoſe that a gentleman of Dr. Monro's great accuracy, would have omitted circumſtances ſo remarkable; but I think we may, on the contrary, infer from his ſilence, and from the following concluſions, which he himſelf draws from the above-mentioned monſtrous productions, and which I ſhall take the liberty of quoting, as the work is not in every perſon's hands, that they were really born dead:—</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Nay we may, perhaps, go a ſtep farther, and doubt whether, inſtead of conſidering the brain as the origin of the nerves, we ought not to conſider it merely as connected with the nerves: or whether there are better reaſons for ſuppoſing the brain to produce the nerves, than for ſuppoſing the nerves to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the brain. Some facts, at leaſt, may be here obſerved, which ſeem to ſhew that the nerves may exiſt, independent of the brain.</q>

                     <q>I. In children delivered at the full time, plump and well formed in their trunk and limbs, I have obſerved the ſubſtance which ſupplied the place of the brain, not more bulky than a ſmall nut; and, inſtead of containing a white medullary ſubſtance, it was of a red colour, reſembling a clot of blood: and ſmall cords, occupying the place of the optic nerves, were likewiſe of a red colour. Yet the ſpinal marrow, and all the nerves from it, had the ordinary ſize and appearance.</q>

                  <p>At eight o'clock on Monday morning, May 26, 1788, Mary Clarke, aged 26 years, and the mother of ſix children, ſome of whom are healthy and others unhealthy, was delivered of a living female child, at the expence of the Carliſle diſpenſary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0873500300:106"/>The midwife, ſhocked at the ſtrange and unuſual appearance of the child's head, ſent for me immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. I got there about an hour after the delivery, and at firſt ſight, it appeared evident that the bones which form the upper part of the ſcull were wanting, and that the brain was only covered by its proper membranes, the <hi>pia</hi> and <hi>dura mater,</hi> and reſembled a large excreſcence which projected a little over the common integuments, eſpecially towards the forehead, where it extended over the root of the noſe. The colour of this ſubſtance was a dark reddiſh brown, and upon examining it more particularly, I thought I could perceive the diviſion of the two hemiſpheres of the brain, and likewiſe the diviſion of the cerebrum from the cerebellum. I gently raiſed with my fingers, a part of it which projected over the integuments, which made the child cry, and produced a conſiderable ſtarting, ſimilar to what is occaſioned by an electric ſhock. The child was full grown, and ſeemed in perfect health, her limbs were plump, firm, and well proportioned, and ſhe moved them with apparent agility. The external organs of ſenſe were alſo perfect. She ſwallowed well, and took a ſufficient quantity of nouriſhment for ſeveral days, but ſometimes during the action of ſwallowing ſtarted a little. She lived till five o'clock on Sunday morning, June the 1ſt, when ſhe expired Some time before her death ſhe was affected with flight convulſions. During the three or four days preceding her death, there was a conſtant diſcharge of a thin watery fluid, ſomewhat tinged with blood, from the excreſcence, which greatly diminiſhed its bulk; for at her death, it was only about half the ſize of what it had been when ſhe was born, and the ſurface was, in ſome places, beginning to put on an appearance of mortification.</p>
                  <p>A few hours after her death, Dr. Blamire, and Mr. Charles Fariſh, accompanied me to the houſe, where Dr. Blamire very cautiouſly diſſected, away from the bones, the whole of the ſubſtance; when we found the greateſt part of the frontal, the temporal, the occipital, and the whole of the parietal bones wanting. The ſubſtance removed was then carefully examined, and what was our aſtoniſhment to find it entirely to conſiſt of membranes, blood-veſſels, but principally of ſeveral bags; one of which was as large as a nut-meg, the reſt of different ſizes, but much ſmaller. They were all filled with a browniſh coloured fluid; which, when the cyſts were punctured, guſhed out with ſome violence.</p>
                  <p>There was not the leaſt appearance of cerebrum, cerebellum, or any medullary ſubſtance whatever. The ſpinal marrow had a natural appearance, but did not ſeem to have been connected with the parts above deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Having accurately related the facts as they appeared to Dr. Blamire and myſelf, which for their ſingularity deſerve to be recorded; I think the few following obvious inferences may be drawn from them 1. That the fluid diſcharged from the excreſcence during the life of the infant, and which produced the great dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of its bulk, was occaſioned by the rupture, or eroſion of cyſts, ſimilar to thoſe which remained ſound and full of water after death. 2d, That the living principle, the nerves of the trunk, and extremities, ſenſation and motion, may exiſt independent of, and that the natural, vital, and animal functions, may be performed without the brain. And as the external organs of ſenſe, viz. the eyes, the noſe, the tongue, and the ears, all ſeemed perfect; may we not, therefore, ſuppoſe, that the optic, the olfactory, the guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and the auditory nerves, may exiſt independent of, and unconnected with either the brain or ſpinal marrow?</p>
                  <p>I content myſelf with little more than deſcribing this extraordinary caſe, and leave to others to deduce from it, ſuch concluſions as the appearances obſerved may be thought to warrant.</p>
                  <p>FOR THE YEAR 1796.] In the month of April, this year, a ſurvey, under the direction of the editors, was made by Mr. Johnſton, a perſon of accuracy and attention, who found that the two pariſhes of St. Mary and St. Cuthbert contained 1587 houſes, 2616 families, and 10,289 inhabitants. It therefore appears that the increaſe ſince 1780 has been 2612; and ſince 1787, 1612.—For a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the different ſurveys which have been made, ſee Tables I. and III.</p>

                  <p>EXTBNT.] North and ſouth about five miles and a half; eaſt and weſt about three miles.</p>
                  <p>SOIL AND PRODUCE.] The ſoil is very different in quality and fertility: a ſandy or gravelly loam prevails in the vicinage of Carliſle and Carleton: a loam, in which clay predominates, is found in moſt other parts of theſe pariſhes, particularly about Botchardby Harraby, Uprightby, Blackhall, and moſt parts of the chapel of Wreay. About Cumerſdale, a greyiſh ſoil covers a ſtratum of clay. Towards the ſouthern and weſtern extremities, are conſiderable tracts of mooriſh ſoils, which, not many years ago, were very barren commons; but which, by incloſure and proper management, are now generally in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive ſtate of improvement.</p>
                  <p>Land near Carliſle is chiefly applied to the purpoſes of dairying, breeding and feeding ſheep, growing hay for horſes, &amp;c. Wheat is the principal grain cultivated upon the beſt ſtrong ſoils; a fallow gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally precedes. On ſoils having a conſiderable portion of land, turnips, barley, and clover, or other artificial graſſes, are beginning to be much ſown, which is found to be a very profitable ſyſtem. Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes form a conſiderable article of cultivation in theſe pariſhes. On the late incloſed commons, oats is the moſt prevailing crop: that grain alſo has its turn in the courſe of huſbandry in more fertile diſtricts, as have peaſe and beans. I am ſorry to add, that the barbarous and unprofitable ſyſtem of taking two or more white crops in ſucceſſion, though yearly loſing ground, has yet its advocates here The great quantity of manure made at Carliſle, fertilizes the ſoil in the neighbourhood; and the crops are generally abundant. Graſs ground increaſe, while that in tillage diminiſhes.</p>
                  <p>RENT.] Within half a mile of Carliſle, is from 3l. to 5l. 10s. per acre. In old incloſures, and pretty good ſoils at a greater diſtance, from 1l. to about 2l. 10s. There are, however, ſome farms, where the ſoil is unfertile, that do not fetch above 10s. per acre.</p>
                  <p>So great is the improvement of land in theſe pariſhes that, I was told, ground which did not bring more than 8s. per acre, forty years ago, is now let from 2l. to 3l. 10s. per acre. It was at that period in common field.</p>
                  <p>SHEEP AND CATTLE.] About five hundred or ſix hundred ſheep may be kept here, which are moſtly of the ſhort legged, long wooled breed. The ſtanding ſtocks are improving in fineneſs of bone and wool, and inclination to feed, by tups of the improved breed from the ſtocks of Mr. Culley, and other eminent ſheep-breeders in Northumberland.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Porter of Carliſle ranks among the firſt who introduced that profitable breed into Cumberland, and is now in poſſeſſion of a valuable ſtock, which depaſture upon the Swifts. Cattle are generally of the beſt Cumberland breeds; but the cow keepers about Carliſle ſeem to prefer the ſhort horned, or Dutch ſort; ſome of which, when properly fed, afford a very great quantity of milk. There are inſtances of ſome giving forty quarts per day (wine meaſure) for a few weeks after calving; thirty quarts is not very uncommon, and twenty-four frequent. She is, however, eſteemed a good cow, that affords from ſixteen to twenty quarts of milk per day for great part of the ſummer. Theſe cows are fed with the moſt luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant graſs in ſummer, hay in winter, and generally grains or potatoes every day in the year. The expence
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0873500300:108"/>of feeding is heavy: but the moſt experienced cow keepers have found that the great ſecret of profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by cows, is to ſelect the beſt milkers, either of the Dutch, Lancaſhire, or Galloway breeds, and to feed them with ſufficient quantities of the beſt food. That however, it muſt be acknowledged, is a practice not much followed in moſt other parts of this county.</p>
                  <p>RIVERS AND FISH.] The Eden, Caldew, and Petterel, water theſe pariſhes. Theſe rivers abound with trout, eel, and other ſorts of ſmall fiſh, common in the country. In the Eden large quantities of ſalmon are caught. The waters of Caldew and Petterel, and particularly the former, are remarkable for the quality of bleaching white. It is rather an unpleaſant reflection, that theſe rapid ſtreams, ſo peculiarly adapted to the purpoſe of turning machinery for miles above Carliſle, more particularly the Caldew: and by a proper application of which, that city might be rendered almoſt the Birmingham of the north, ſhould only be employed in giving motion to three or four ſolitary corn mills, and a few cotton works.</p>
                  <p>THE KING-GARTH FISHERY.] A little below Cargo, is the King-Garth fiſhery, which the corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Carliſle, held under the charter of Edward III. and having given riſe to a ſubject of ſome notoriety in this part of the county, a few years ago, it may not be amiſs here to give a ſhort account of it.</p>
                  <p>An eye draught of the <hi>Stell Fiſheries</hi> at King-garth.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>A. The main river of Eden, formerly a ſmall ſtream, called the <hi>Gut</hi> or <hi>Goat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>B. Where the ſtells croſſed the river.</p>
                  <p>C. The ancient main courſe of the river, where the ſtells were formerly placed, now dried up, called King-Garth.</p>
                  <p>D. King-Garth fiſhhouſe.</p>
                  <p>E. Carbed.</p>
                  <p>F. Cargo-Holm.</p>
                  <p>This fiſhery of the corporation (being a <hi>ſeveral fiſhery</hi>) extended only acroſs the ſtream, between Cargo-holm and Carbed, and ſo hath been loſt, by the river altering its courſe many years ago. The fiſhery in that part of the river where the ſtell was lately placed, belonged to Lord Lonſdale; and was, till lately, under leaſe to the corporation. The device for catching fiſh, called a <hi>Stell,</hi> uſed by the leſſees of the corporation, was a net acroſs the water, tied to ſtakes drove in for that purpoſe, which caught or ſtopped moſt of the ſalmon; it being only in high floods that any could get paſt it: by thoſe means the other fiſheries higher up the river, were become of trifling value.</p>
                  <p>For remedy whereof, an action was commenced, in the year 1783, by the owners of thoſe other fiſheries, againſt the leſſees of the corporation upon the ſtatute 2d. Hen. VI. chap. 15th. (which ſtatute expreſsly prohibits the ſtanding of nets faſtened to poſts, continually day and night, overthwart the river Thames, and other rivers of the realm: under the penalty of 100 ſhillings for every offence).—This action came to a hearing at the aſſizes at Carliſle, the ſame year, before judge Buller; when a verdict was given for the plaintiff: and which, on a new trial the year following, was confirmed. Since which, that fiſhery hath been occupied by Lord Lonſdale's agents, in the uſual way of nets drawn by hands.</p>
                  <p>It may be obſerved, that, this matter was about being brought to a legal deciſion, about fifty years ago, when the double paſſage in the river occaſioned the difficulty of obtaining redreſs, in regard the nets not being entirely <hi>overthwart</hi> the ſame, within the deſcription and meaning of the act.</p>
                  <p>The corporation are alſo entitled to a <hi>free fiſhery</hi> (generally called a <hi>boat fiſhery</hi>) in this river, which was granted by the charter of Edward IV.</p>
                  <p>There are from this part of the river up to Carliſle, about ſeventeen other boat fiſhings, belonging to at leaſt, as many different proprietors; the annual value of which are various, between 6l. and 40l. each, and upwards.</p>
                  <p>ROADS.] Are tolerably good. Two old faſhioned narrow ſtone bridges, over two branches of the Eden connect Carliſle with Stanwix. Caldewgate is alſo connected with Carliſle by two ſtone bridges over as many branches of the Caldew. Two roads, the one from the ſouth and the other from the eaſt, croſs the Petterel; and at each place there is a ſtone bridge. The road from London to Edinburgh, and that from Whitehaven to Newcaſtle, interſect theſe pariſhes in different directions.</p>
                  <p>FUEL.] Is chiefly coal from Tindale-fell.</p>
                  <note place="bottom">
                     <hi>* Since the laſt page was printed off, we were credibly informed the number of ſheep kept in theſe two pariſhes, is about</hi> 1600.</note>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0873500300:109"/>GAME.] Are hares and partridges.</p>
                  <p>QUARRIES AND BUILDINGS.] In theſe pariſhes are excellent freeſtone quarries in different places. Thoſe of moſt note are on the Petterel near Newbiggin, and thoſe near Durdare and Burnthwaite.—No limeſtone. Near Quarrygate is a vein or quarry of alabaſter, or gypſum. Buildings are generally pretty good, and covered with blue or red ſtate: a few houſes are yet thatched, and ſome are even built with clay walls.</p>
                  <p>TITHES.] A conſiderable part of theſe pariſhes pay tithes in kind; and a portion pay a modus in lieu thereof.</p>
                  <p>SCHOOL.] At Blackhall, a donation amounting annually to 5l. 8s. was left by the late Thomas Lowry, Eſq. of Blackhall, for the education of ſeven poor children.</p>
                  <p>WOODS AND PLANTATIONS.] The banks of Caldew are cloathed with wood, principally oak; ſome ſmall plots of woodland appear in other parts, and a few trees grow on hedge-rows. Several hundred acres of the moſt barren parts of the common, when they were incloſed, were planted with foreſt trees, and chiefly Scotch fir: they have ſucceeded beyond the expectation of every one, and now not only beautify the country, and ſhelter the farms in the neighbourhood, but will ultimately prove very profitable to the proprietors. Rearing of wood is the moſt profitable way of applying moſt barren ſoils.</p>
                  <p>ASPECT AND GENERAL APPEARANCE.] Though this diſtrict contains many irregular, but gentle ſwells; it is as level, and perhaps more ſo, than moſt parts of the county: the general inclination is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north, but ſmall.</p>
                  <p>The extenſive vales, formed by the Eden, the Caldew and Petterel, are level, fertile, and beautiful; they incircle Carliſle, which riſes on a gentle eminence in the centre, and commands a pleaſant proſpect of the adjacent country. Among other delightful views which appear from that city, the neat houſe, gardens, &amp;c. of William Richardſon, Eſq. at Rickerby, are ſeen beyond the verdant fields through which the Eden winds its way, and forms an excellent object.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Loſh of Woodſide is making every thing ſmile round him: his houſe, his garden, his farms, are almoſt daily under his improving hands: land too barren for tillage he plants with wood. Between Woodſide and Durdare is a tract of very poor ground, divided, but not incloſed, nor cultivated: Mr. Loſh has lately purchaſed a ſmall part thereof for 2l. 10s. per acre, incloſed and planted it with foreſt trees: the other proprietors, it appears, have not yet diſcovered how much it would be to their advantage, either to diſpoſe of their ſhares to Mr. Loſh; or follow his example in turning them to profit.</p>
                  <p>COUNTY GAOL AT CARLISLE.] Is old, much out of repair, and without the regular means of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the different rooms with freſh air, ſo neceſſary in theſe wretched receptacles of guilt and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The celebrated Mr. Howard deſcribes it as follows:—</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The court ſpacious, 85 yards by 36: it was common to all priſoners; but now a part is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the felons, and ſeparated by iron paliſades. In the court is a chapel, built as appears by the date, in 1734. Five rooms for maſter ſide debtors: and as many on the common ſide. Moſt of the latter are large, but have windows to the ſtreet. Where there are ſo many rooms, not to ſeparate the men and women is certainly inexcuſable.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The wards for felons are two rooms, down a ſtep or two; dark and dirty. One of them, the day room, had a window to the ſtreet; through which ſpirituous liquors, and tools for miſchief, might be eaſily conveyed: but it is now bricked up: the night room is only 11 feet by 9. At my laſt viſit, <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women</hi> were lodged together in it.
<note n="†" place="bottom">The men and women felons are now confined in ſeparate apartments.</note> Two rooms over the felons' wards, which have been uſed as tap rooms, ſeem to be intended for the <hi>women</hi> only,
<note n="‡" place="bottom">They are now appropriated to that purpoſe.</note> but in <hi>one</hi> of theſe I alſo found <hi>three men,</hi> and four <hi>women,</hi> lodged together. No infirmary. Tranſports had not the allowance of two ſhillings and ſixpence a week. Clauſes againſt ſpirituous liquors, and act for preſerving the health of priſoners, not hung up. Gaol delivery <hi>once</hi> a year. Few gaols have ſo many convenient rooms for common ſide debtors. It is the more remarkable here, becauſe there is <hi>no table</hi> ſigned by the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, to particularize the free wards. Some gaolers avail themſelves of ſuch a circumſtance, and demand rent for rooms which were undoubtedly deſigned for common ſide priſoners.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The furniture is provided by the priſoners, and is generally wretched in the extreme. Mr. Mullinder, the preſent gaoler, ſeems, however, to keep the different apartments as clean and comfortable as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admit. The rooms and paſſages are whitewaſhed once a year; and the felons' rooms (wholly compoſed of ſtone) cleaned of all noxious matter, by burning a large quantity of ſtraw upon the floor, ſo that diſorders rarely prevail there. We would, however, recommend a more frequent uſe of lime as a waſh: being convinced, that, nothing is more conducive to the prevention, or eradication of infections.—The priſoners have an opportunity of purchaſing milk and vegetables, every day, in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0873500300:110"/>great plenty. No ale nor ſpirits are now ſold in the gaol: and it is much to be wiſhed that intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting liquors were very ſparingly allowed to be brought therein.</p>
                  <p>The magiſtrates for the county have had it in contemplation, theſe ſeveral years, to build a new goal, in the caſtle-green: and have prepared a large quantity of ſtones for the purpoſe: a ſituation we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not too much recommend: but from what reaſon the deſign is not forwarded, we are not informed.</p>
                  <p>IMPORTATIONS AND EXPORTATIONS AT CARLISLE PORT.] Extracted from the cuſtom houſe books.—The importations principally conſiſt of deals, tar, ſtaves, rum, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grain, potatoes, oak bark, oat meal, flour, timber, lead, freeſtone, herrings, alabaſter, Britiſh barrel ſtaves, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
