            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, but liſten to reaſon, Mrs. Dimity,— has not your maſter, Mr. Drugget, invited me down to his country-ſeat, in order to give me his daughter Nancy in marriage; and with what pretence can he now break off?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dim.</speaker>
                  <p>What pretence!—you put a body out of all patience—But go on your own way, Sir; my advice is all loſt upon you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
                  <p>You do me injuſtice, Mrs. Dimity—your advice has governed my whole conduct—Have not I ſixed an intereſt in the young lady's heart?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dim.</speaker>
                  <p>An intereſt in a fiddleſtick!—you ought to have made love to the father and mother—what, do you think the way to get a wife, at this time of day, is by ſpeaking ſine things to the lady you have a fancy for? —That was the practice, indeed; but things are alter'd now—you muſt addreſs the old people, Sir; and never trouble your head about your miſtreſs—None of your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1256001100:4"/>letters, and verſes, and ſoft looks, and fine ſpeeches, — <q>Have compaſſion, thou angelic creature, on a poor dying</q>—Pſhaw! ſtuff! nonſenſe! all out of faſhion, —Go your ways to the old curmudgeon, humour his whims— <q>I ſhall eſteem it an honour, Sir, to be allied to a gentleman of your rank and taſte.</q> 
                     <q>Upon my word, he's a pretty young gentleman.</q>—Then wheel about to the mother: <q>Your daughter, Ma'am, is the very model of you, and I ſhall adore her for your ſake.</q> 
                     <q>Here, come hither, Nancy, take this gentleman for better for worſe.</q> 
                     <q>La, mama, I can never conſent.</q>— <q>I ſhould not have thought of your conſent—the conſent of your relations is enough: why, how now, huſſey!</q> So away you go to church, the knot is tied, an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able honey-moon follows, the charm is then diſſolv'd; you go to all the clubs in St. James's Street; your lady goes to the Coterie; and, in a little time you both go to Doctor's Commons; and, if faults on both ſides prevent a divorce, you'll quarrel like contrary elements all the reſt of your lives: that's the way of the world now.</p>

                  <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
                  <p>But you know, my dear Dimity, the old couple have received every mark of attention from me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dim.</speaker>
                  <p>Attention! to be ſure you did not fall aſleep in their company; but what then?—You ſhould have entered into their characters, play'd with their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and ſacrificed to their abſurdities.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Dim.</speaker>
                  <p>Frank, indeed! yes, you have been frank enough to ruin yourſelf.—Have not you to do with a rich old ſhop-keeper, retired from buſineſs with an hundred thouſand pounds in his pocket, to enjoy the duſt of the London road, which he calls living in the country—and yet you muſt find fault with his ſituation! —What if he has made a ridiculous gimcrack of his houſe and gardens, you know his heart is ſet upon it; and could not you have commended his taſte? But you muſt be too frank!— <q>Thoſe walks and alleys are too regular—thoſe evergreens ſhould not be cut
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1256001100:5"/>into ſuch fantaſtic ſhapes.</q>—And thus you adviſe a poor old mechanic, who delights in every thing that's monſtrous, to follow nature—Oh, you're likely to be a ſucceſsful lover!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
                  <p>But why ſhould I not ſave a father-in-law from being a laughing-ſtock?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dim.</speaker>
                  <p>Make him your father-in-law firſt—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, he can't open his windows for the duſt —he ſtands all day looking through a pane of glaſs at the carts and ſtage-coaches as they paſs by, and he calls that living in the freſh air, and enjoying his own thoughts.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dim.</speaker>
                  <p>And could not you let him go on his own way? You have ruin'd yourſelf by talking ſenſe to him; and all your nonſenſe to the daughter won't make amends for it.—And then the mother; how have you play'd your cards in that quarter?—She wants a tinſel man of faſhion for her ſecond daughter—"Don't you ſee (ſays ſhe) how happy my eldeſt girl is made by marrying Sir Charles Rackett. She has been married three entire weeks, and not ſo much as one angry word has paſs'd between them—Nancy ſhall have a man of quality too."</p>

                  <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
                  <p>And yet I know Sir Charles Rackett per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dim.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, ſo do I; and I know he'll make his lady wretched at laſt—But what then? You ſhould have humour'd the old folks,—you ſhould have been a talking empty fop, to the good old lady, and to the old gentleman, an admirer of his taſte in gardening. But you have loſt him—he is grown fond of this beau Lovelace, who is here in the houſe with him; the coxcomb ingratiates himſelf by flattery, and you're undone by frankneſs.</p>

                  <speaker>Dim.</speaker>
                  <p>And yet you have reaſon to deſpair; a million of reaſons—To-morrow is fix'd for the wedding-day; Sir Charles and his lady are to be here this very night— they are engag'd, indeed, at a great rout in town, but they take a bed here, notwithſtanding.—The family is ſitting up for them; Mr. Drugget will keep you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1256001100:6"/>all up in the next room there, till they arrive—and to-morrow the buſineſs is over—and yet you don't deſpair!—huſh!—hold your tongue; here comes Lovelace.—Step in, and I'll deviſe ſomething, I warrant you. <stage>(<hi>Exit</hi> Woodley)</stage> The old folks ſhall not have their own way—'tis enough to vex a body, to ſee an old father and mother marrying their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as they pleaſe, in ſpite of all I can do.</p>

                  <p>Oh! perfectly, Sir; they gratify my taſte of all things. One ſees villas where nature reigns in a wild kind of ſimplicity; but then they have no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of art, no art at all.</p>
