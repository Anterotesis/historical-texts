            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <l>FROM Stratford arriv'd—piping hot—gentle folks,</l>
            <l>From the rareſt fine ſhows and moſt wonderful jokes,</l>
            <l>Your ſimple acquaintance, Scrub, comes to declare</l>
            <l>'Twas fuller by far than our Litchfield great fair,</l>
            <l>Such crouds of fine ladies, ſerenading and ſinging</l>
            <l>Such firing of loud pateraroes and ringing,</l>
            <l>To tell it in London muſt ſeem all a fable</l>
            <l>And yet I will tell it as well as I'm able:</l>
            <l>Firſt ſomething in linguo of ſchools call'd an ode;</l>
            <l>All critics they told me allow'd very good,</l>
            <l>One ſaid—you may take it for truth I aſſure ye</l>
            <l>'Twas made by the little great man of old Drury,</l>
            <l>By my brother Martin—for whoſe ſake d'ye hear,</l>
            <l>This night I'd a mind for a touch at Shakeſpeare<note n="*" place="bottom">This alludes to Mr. Weſton's intention of playing Richard.</note>.</l>
            <l>But honeſtly ſpeaking I take more delight in</l>
            <l>A bit of good fun, than drums, trumpets and fighting.</l>
            <l>The Proceſſion, 'twas ſaid, would have been a fine train;</l>
            <l>But could not move forwards—oh la, for the rain.</l>
            <l>Such tragical, comical folks and ſo fine—</l>
            <l>What pity it was that the ſun did not ſhine,</l>
            <l>Since ladies and baronets, aldermen, ſquires,</l>
            <l>All went to this Jubilee full of deſires,</l>
            <l>In crouds as they go for to ſee a new play</l>
            <l>And when it was done—why they all came away.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:0057600500:4"/>Don't let me forget—a main part of the ſhow</l>
            <l>Was long tailed fine comets by fam'd Angelo,</l>
            <l>Some turtle I got which they call'd paſhapee—</l>
            <l>But honeſt roaſt beef's the beſt turtle for me.</l>
            <l>I hate all ragouts, and, like a bold Briton,</l>
            <l>Prefer good plumb pudding to ought I e'er bit on.</l>
            <l>I drank too—and now I a poet may be—</l>
            <l>From a charming fine cup of the mulberry tree.</l>
            <l>To bed I muſt go—for which like a ninny</l>
            <l>I paid—like my betters—no leſs than a guinea.</l>
            <l>For rolling—not ſleeping—in linen ſo damp</l>
            <l>As ſtruck my great toe ever ſince with the cramp,</l>
            <l>Thus fleec'd—in my pocket I felt a great ſmarting</l>
            <l>Yet griev'd not when I and the ſplinters were parting,</l>
            <l>'Twas worth ten times more to hear ſweet brother Martin.</l>
            <l>He ſpoke till poor Scrub was juſt fit, with one eye</l>
            <l>To laugh, while the other was ready to cry:</l>
            <l>Which makes me now tell you without any brag</l>
            <l>He's ſecond to none but the Warwickſhire wag.</l>
            <l>The Jubilee over, I come to this place</l>
            <l>To tell you my ſtory and ſue for your grace.</l>
            <l>You never refus'd it—yet never before</l>
            <l>With granting ſuch kindneſs bound gratitude more.</l>

            <l>Your favours have ever out-run my ſlight merit.<note n="*⁎*" place="bottom">The reader will eaſily perceive that this Prologue is merely occaſional</note>

                     <p>Lard, madam! there is ſuch a variety, that it is almoſt impoſſible to adviſe. When I lived with lady Bab. Rattle, ſhe employed ſix hours a day for three months, and could ſcarce fix upon any thing at laſt;—one day ſhe would be a Turk; the next a Chriſtian; the third a Chineſe; the fourth a Dutch woman; next a Heathen, Goddeſs; then a Savoyard; ſoon after a gipſy, a witch, and twenty others:—at laſt ſhe thought of transforming herſelf into a moving bee-hive, intimating that beauty is pregnant with the ſtings of love—but, alas! upon entering the ball<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, ſhe ſaw two other bee-hives dancing a cotilion with the ſun, the moon, a bear, an oſtrich, Hamlet's ghoſt, and an animated butter-caſk.—This had ſuch an effect upon her, that ſhe retired immediately, and almoſt fretted herſelf into a conſumption.</p>
