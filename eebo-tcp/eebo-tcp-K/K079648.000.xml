            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE following eſſays, and poem, I beg leave to inſcribe to you. Indeed I do little more, than return your own: for the beſt remarks, and obſervations in them, are yours. Such as may be cavilled at, I am perſuaded, muſt be mine.</p>
            <p>A publiſhed work is certainly a fair object of criticiſm: but I think, my dear ſir, we pictureſque people are a little miſunderſtood with regard to our <hi>general intention.</hi> I have
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0566001100:3"/>
ſeveral times been ſurprized at finding us repreſented, as ſuppoſing, <hi>all beauty</hi> to conſiſt in <hi>pictureſque beauty</hi>—and the face of nature to be examined <hi>only by the rules of painting.</hi> Whereas, in fact, we always ſpeak a different language. We ſpeak of the grand ſcenes of nature, tho unintereſting in a <hi>pictureſque light,</hi> as having a ſtrong effect on the imagination— often a ſtronger, than when they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly diſpoſed for the pencil. We every where make a diſtinction between ſcenes, that are <hi>beautiful,</hi> and <hi>amuſing;</hi> and ſcenes that are <hi>pictureſque.</hi> We examine, and admire both. Even artificial objects we admire, whether in a grand, or in a humble ſtile, tho unconnected with pictureſque beauty—the palace, and the cottage—the improved garden-ſcene, and the neat homeſtall. Works of tillage alſo afford us equal delight—the plough, the mower, the reaper, the hay-field, and the harveſt-wane. In a word, we reverence, and admire the works of God; and look with benevolence, and pleaſure, on the works of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0566001100:4"/>In what then do we offend? At the expence of no other ſpecies of beauty, we merely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to illuſtrate, and recommend <hi>one</hi> ſpecies more; which, tho among the moſt intereſting, hath never yet, ſo far as I know, been made the ſet object of inveſtigation. From ſcenes indeed of the <hi>pictureſque kind</hi> we exclude the appendages of tillage, and in general the works of men; which too often introduce preciſeneſs, and formality. But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding artificial objects from one ſpecies of beauty, is not degrading them from all. We leave then the general admirer of the beauties of nature to his own purſuits; nay we admire them with him: all we deſire, is, that he would leave us as quietly in the poſſeſſion of our amuſements.</p>
            <p>Under this apology, my dear ſir, I have ventured, in the following eſſays, to inlarge a little both on our theory, and practice. In the firſt eſſay (that we may be fairly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) the <hi>diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic</hi> is marked,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0566001100:5"/>
of <hi>ſuch beautiful objects,</hi> as are ſuited to the pencil. In the ſecond, the mode of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is pointed out, that may ariſe from viewing the ſcenes of nature in a pictureſque light: and in the third, a few rules are given for ſketching landſcape after nature. I have practiſed drawing as an amuſement, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, for many years; and here offer the reſult of my experience. Some readineſs in <hi>execution</hi> indeed, it is ſuppoſed, is neceſſary, before theſe rules can be of much ſervice. They mean to take the young artiſt up, where the drawing-maſter leaves him.—I have only to add farther, that as ſeveral of the rules, and principles here laid down, have been touched in different pictureſque works, which I have given the public, I have endeavoured not to repeat myſelf: and where I could not throw new light on a ſubject, I have haſtened over it:—only in a work of this kind, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to bring all my principles together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0566001100:6"/>With regard to the poem, annexed to theſe eſſays, ſomething more ſhould be ſaid. As that ſmall part of the public, who perſonally know me; and that ſtill ſmaller part, whom I have the honour to call my friends, may think me guilty of preſumption in attempting a work of this kind, I beg leave to give the following hiſtory of it.</p>
            <p>Several years ago, I amuſed myſelf with writing a few lines in verſe on landſcape-painting; and afterwards ſent them, as a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for they were not finiſhed) to amuſe a friend.<note n="*" place="bottom">Edward Forſter <abbr>eſq</abbr> of Walthamſtow.</note> I had no other purpoſe. My friend told me, he could not ſay much for my <hi>poetry;</hi> but as my <hi>rules,</hi> he thought, were good, he wiſhed me to finiſh my frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if I ſhould not like it as a <hi>poem,</hi> I might turn it into an <hi>eſſay in proſe.</hi>—As this was only what I expected, I was not diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; tho not encouraged to proceed. So
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0566001100:7"/>
I troubled my head no farther with my verſes.</p>
            <p>Some time after, another friend,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. Mr. Maſon.</note> finding fault with my mode of deſcribing the lakes, and mountains of Cumberland, and Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as too poetical, I told him the fate of my fragment; lamenting the hardſhip of my caſe—when I wrote verſe, one friend called it proſe; and when I wrote proſe, another friend called it verſe. In his next letter he deſired to ſee my verſes; and being pleaſed with the ſubject, he offered, if I would finiſh my poem (however careleſsly as to metrical exactneſs) he would adjuſt the verſification. But he found, he had engaged in a more arduous affair, than he expected. My rules, and tecnical terms were ſtubborn, and would not eaſily glide into verſe; and I was as ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, as they, and would not relinquiſh the ſcientific part for the poetry. My friend's
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0566001100:8"/>
good-nature therefore generally gave way, and ſuffered many lines to ſtand, and many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made, which his own good taſte could not approve.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Extract of a letter from Mr. Maſon.</p>
                  <q>—I have inſerted conſcientiouſly every word, and phraſe, you have altered; except the awkward word <hi>clump,</hi> which I have uniformly diſcarded, whenever it offered itſelf to me in my Engliſh garden, which you may imagine it did frequently: in it's ſtead I have always uſed <hi>tuft.</hi> I have ventured therefore to inſert it adjectively; and I hope, I ſhall be forgiven. Except in this ſingle inſtance, I know not that I have deviated in the leaſt from the alterations, you ſent.—I now quit all that relates to the poem, not without ſome ſelf-ſatisfaction in thinking it is over: for, to own the truth, had I thought you would have expected ſuch almoſt mathematical <hi>exactitude of terms,</hi> as I find you do; and in conſequence turned lines tolerably poetical, into proſaic, for the ſake of preciſion, I ſhould never have ventured to give you my aſſiſtance.</q>
               </note> I am afraid therefore I muſt appear to the world, as having ſpoiled a good poem; and muſt ſhelter myſelf, and it under thoſe learned reaſons, which have been given for putting <hi>Propria quae maribus,</hi> and <hi>As in praeſenti,</hi> into verſe. If the rules have injured the poetry; as <hi>rules</hi> at leaſt, I
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0566001100:9"/>
hope, they will meet your approbation. I am, dear ſir, with the greateſt eſteem, and regard,</p>

            <head>EXPLANATION OF THE <hi>PRINTS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TWO facing page 19. It is the intention of theſe two prints to illuſtrate how very adverſe the idea of <hi>ſmoothneſs</hi> is to the <hi>compoſition</hi> of landſcape. In the ſecond of them the <hi>great lines</hi> of the landſcape are exactly the ſame as in the firſt; only they are <hi>more broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two facing p. 75. The firſt of theſe prints is meant to illuſtrate the idea of <hi>ſimple illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> The light falls ſtrongly on <hi>various</hi> parts; as indeed it often does in nature. But, as it is the painter's buſineſs to take nature in her moſt beautiful form, he chuſes to throw his light more into a <hi>maſs,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the ſecond print, which exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits the <hi>ſame landſcape,</hi> only better inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. When we merely take the <hi>lines</hi> of a landſcape from nature; and <hi>inlighten</hi> it
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0566001100:11"/>
(as we muſt often do) from our own taſte, and judgment, the maſſing of the light muſt be well attended to, as one of the great ſources of beauty. It muſt not be ſcattered in ſpots; but muſt be brought more together, as on the rocky ſide of the hill in the ſecond print: and yet it muſt graduate alſo in different parts; ſo as not to appear affected.</p>
            <p>One print facing p. 77. The idea of <hi>gradation</hi> is here farther illuſtrated; according to the explanation in p. 76. — The inſcription is that admired one of Caecilia Metella, the daughter of Metellus, and the wife of Craſſus; in which, with ſo much elegant, and tender ſimplicity, her name is divided between her father, and her huſband.</p>
            <p>One facing p. 79. This print exemplifies a <hi>ſimple mode</hi> of <hi>tinting</hi> a drawing, as explained in the text. The colouring of this print (which is done by hand) has added a little to the expence of the book: but it was thought neceſſary to compleat the ſcheme. —It was coloured by a relation of mine; Mr. Gilpin, drawing-maſter at Paddington-green; who in all the copies I have ſeen, has illuſtrated my ideas very ſatisfactorily; and who, as far as the recommendation of a partial kinſman may go, deſerves mine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0566001100:12"/>One facing p. 85. This print is an explanation of a few rules in perſpective; juſt ſufficient for the uſe of common landſcape.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:0566001100:14"/>ESSAY I.</head>
                  <p>DISPUTES about beauty might perhaps be involved in leſs confuſion, if a diſtinction were eſtabliſhed, which certainly exiſts, between ſuch objects as are <hi>beautiful,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>pictureſque</hi>—between thoſe, which pleaſe the eye in their <hi>natural ſtate;</hi> and thoſe, which pleaſe from ſome quality, capable of being <hi>illuſtrated in painting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ideas of beauty vary with the object, and with the eye of the ſpectator. Thoſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial forms appear generally the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, with which we have been the moſt converſant. Thus the ſtone-maſon ſees beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in a well-jointed wall, which eſcape the architect, who ſurveys the building under a different idea. And thus the painter, who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0566001100:15"/>
compares his object with the rules of his art, ſees it in a different light from the man of general taſte, who ſurveys it only as ſimply beautiful.</p>
                  <p>As this difference therefore between the <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,</hi> and the <hi>pictureſque</hi> appears really to exiſt, and muſt depend on ſome peculiar conſtruction of the object; it may be worth while to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, what that peculiar conſtruction is. We inquire not into the <hi>general ſources of beauty,</hi> either in nature, or in repreſentation. This would lead into a nice, and ſcientific diſcuſſion, in which it is not our purpoſe to engage. The queſtion ſimply is, <hi>What is that quality in objects, which particularly marks them as pictureſque?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In examining the <hi>real object,</hi> we ſhall find, one ſource of beauty ariſes from that ſpecies of elegance, which we call <hi>ſmoothneſs,</hi> or <hi>neatneſs;</hi> for the terms are nearly ſynonymous. The higher the marble is poliſhed, the brighter the ſilver is rubbed, and the more the maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gany ſhines, the more each is conſidered as an object of beauty: as if the eye delighted in gliding ſmoothly over a ſurface.</p>
                  <p>In the claſs of larger objects the ſame idea prevails. In a pile of building we wiſh to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0566001100:16"/>
ſee neatneſs in every part added to the elegance of the architecture. And if we examine a piece of improved pleaſure-ground, every thing rough, and ſlovenly offends.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Burke, enumerating the properties of beauty, conſiders <hi>ſmoothneſs</hi> as one of the moſt eſſential. "A very conſiderable part of the effect of beauty, ſays he, is owing to this quality: indeed the moſt conſiderable: for take any beautiful object, and give it a broken, and rugged ſurface, and however well-formed it may be in other reſpects, it pleaſes no longer. Whereas, let it want ever ſo many of the other conſtituents, if it want not this, it becomes more pleaſing, than almoſt all the others without it."<note n="*" place="bottom">Upon the ſublime and beautiful, p. 213.</note>— How far Mr. Burke may be right in making ſmoothneſs the <hi>moſt conſiderable</hi> ſource of beauty, I rather doubt<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>Mr. Burke is probably not very accurate in what he farther ſays on the connection between <hi>beauty,</hi> and <hi>diminutives.</hi> —Beauty excites love; and a loved object is generally characterized by diminutives. But it does not follow, that all objects characterized by diminutives, tho they may be ſo

Beauty, no doubt, awakens love; but it alſo excites admiration, and reſpect. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination forms the ſentiment, which prevails, when we look at the Apollo of Belvidere, and the Niobe. No man of nice diſcernment would characterize theſe ſtatues by diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. —There is then a beauty, between which and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutives there is no relation; but which, on the contrary, excludes them: and in the deſcription of figures, poſſeſſed of that ſpecies of beauty, we ſeek for terms, which recommend them more to our <hi>admiration,</hi> than our <hi>love.</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0566001100:18"/>
the ſurfaces of bodies: when we ſpeak of their delineation, we uſe the word <hi>ruggedneſs.</hi> Both ideas however equally enter into the pictureſque; and both are obſervable in the ſmaller, as well as in the larger parts of nature—in the outline, and bark of a tree, as in the rude ſummit, and craggy ſides of a mountain.</p>
                  <p>Let us then examine our theory by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to experience; and try how far theſe qualities enter into the idea of <hi>pictureſque beauty;</hi> and how far they mark that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference among objects, which is the ground of our inquiry.</p>
                  <p>A piece of Palladian architecture may be elegant in the laſt degree. The proportion of it's parts—the propriety of it's ornaments—and the ſymmetry of the whole, may be highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. But if we introduce it in a picture, it immediately becomes a formal object, and ceaſes to pleaſe. Should we wiſh to give it pictureſque beauty, we muſt uſe the mallet, inſtead of the chiſſel: we muſt beat down one half of it, deface the other, and throw the mutilated members around in heaps. In ſhort, from a <hi>ſmooth</hi> building we muſt turn it into a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0566001100:19"/>
                     <hi>rough</hi> ruin. No painter, who had the choice of the two objects, would heſitate a moment.</p>
                  <p>Again, why does an elegant piece of garden-ground make no figure on canvas? The ſhape is pleaſing; the combination of the objects, harmonious; and the winding of the walk in the very line of beauty. All this is true; but the <hi>ſmoothneſs</hi> of the whole, tho right, and as it ſhould be in nature, offends in picture. Turn the lawn into a piece of broken ground: plant rugged oaks inſtead of flowering ſhrubs: break the edges of the walk: give it the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a road: mark it with wheel-tracks; and ſcatter around a few ſtones, and bruſh-wood; in a word, inſtead of making the whole <hi>ſmooth,</hi> make it <hi>rough;</hi> and you make it alſo <hi>pictureſque.</hi> All the other ingredients of beauty it already poſſeſſed.</p>
                  <p>You ſit for your picture. The maſter, at your deſire, paints your head combed ſmooth, and powdered from the barber's hand. This may give it a more ſtriking likeneſs, as it is more the reſemblance of the real object. But is it therefore a more pleaſing picture? I fear not. Leave Reynolds to himſelf, and he will make it pictureſque: he will throw the hair diſhevelled about your ſhoulders. Virgil would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0566001100:20"/>
have done the ſame. It was his uſual practice in all his portraits. In his figure of Aſcanius, we have the <hi>fuſos crines;</hi> and in his portrait of Venus, which is highly finiſhed in every part, the artiſt has given her hair, <q>— diffundere ventis.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>The roughneſs, which Virgil gives the hair of Venus, and Aſcanius, we may ſuppoſe to be of a different kind from the ſqualid roughneſs, which he attributes to Charon:
<q>
                                 <l>Portitor has horrendus aquas, et flumina ſervat</l>
                                 <l>Terribili ſqualore Charon, cui plurima mento</l>
                                 <l>Canities inculta jacet. —</l>
                              </q>
Charon's roughneſs is, in it's kind, pictureſque alſo; but the roughneſs here intended, and which can only be introduced in elegant figures, is of that kind, which is merely oppoſed to hair in nice order. In deſcribing Venus, Virgil probably thought hair, when <hi>ſtreaming in the wind,</hi> both beautiful, and pictureſque, from it's undulating form, and varied tints; and from a kind of life, which it aſſumes in motion; tho perhaps it's chief recommendation to him, at the moment, was, that it was a feature of the character, which Venus was then aſſuming.</p>

                  <p>That lovely face of youth ſmiling with all it's ſweet, dimpling charms, how attractive is it in life! how beautiful in repreſentation! It is one of thoſe objects, that pleaſe, as many do, both in nature, and on canvas. But
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0566001100:21"/>
would you ſee the human face in it's higheſt form of <hi>pictureſque beauty,</hi> examine that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal head. What is it, which gives that dignity of character; that force of expreſſion; thoſe lines of wiſdom, and experience; that energetic meaning, ſo far beyond the roſy hue, or even the bewitching ſmile of youth? What is it, but the forehead furrowed with wrinkles? the prominent cheek-bone, catching the light? the muſcles of the cheek ſtrongly marked, and loſing themſelves in the ſhaggy beard? and, above all, the auſtere brow, projecting over the eye—that feature which particularly ſtruck Homer in his idea of Jupiter<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>It is much more probable, that the poet copied <hi>forms</hi> from the ſculptor, who muſt be ſuppoſed to underſtand them better, from having ſtudied them more; than that the ſculptor ſhould copy them from the poet. Artiſts however have taken advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the pre-poſſeſſion of the world for Homer to ſecure approbation to their works by acknowledging them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected images of his conceptions. So Phidias aſſured his countrymen, that he had taken his Jupiter from the deſcription of that god in the firſt book of Homer. The fact is, none of the features contained in that image, except the brow, can be rendered by ſculpture. But he knew what advantage ſuch ideas, as his art could expreſs, would receive from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected in the mind of the ſpectator with thoſe furniſhed by poetry; and from the juſt partiality of men for ſuch a

                     </note>, and which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0566001100:22"/>
he had probably ſeen finely repreſented in ſome ſtatue? in a word, what is it, but the <hi>rough</hi> touches of age?</p>
                  <p>As an object of the mixed kind, partaking both of the <hi>beautiful,</hi> and the <hi>pictureſque,</hi> we admire the human figure alſo. The lines, and ſurface of a beautiful human form are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely varied; the lights and ſhades, which it receives, are ſo exquiſitely tender in ſome parts, and yet ſo round, and bold in others; it's proportions are ſo juſt; and it's limbs ſo fitted to receive all the beauties of grace, and contraſt; that even the face, in which the charms of intelligence, and ſenſibility reſide, is almoſt loſt in the compariſon. But altho the human form, in a quieſcent ſtate, is thus
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0566001100:23"/>
beautiful; yet the more it's <hi>ſmooth ſurface is ruffled,</hi> if I may ſo ſpeak, the more pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque it appears. When it is agitated by paſſion, and it's muſcles ſwoln by ſtrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, the whole frame is ſhewn to the moſt advantage.—But when we ſpeak of muſcles ſwoln by exertion, we mean only natural exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not an affected diſplay of anatomy, in which the muſcles, tho juſtly placed, may ſtill be overcharged.</p>
                  <p>It is true, we are better pleaſed with the uſual repreſentations we meet with of the human form in a quieſcent ſtate, than in an agitated one: but this is merely owing to our ſeldom ſeeing it naturally repreſented in ſtrong action. Even among the beſt maſters we ſee little knowledge of anatomy. One will inflate the muſcles violently to produce ſome trifling effect: another will ſcarce ſwell them in the production of a laboured one. The eye ſoon learns to ſee a defect, tho unable to remedy it. But when the anatomy is perfectly juſt, the human body will always be more pictureſque in action, than at reſt. The great difficulty indeed of repreſenting ſtrong muſcular motion, ſeems to have ſtruck the ancient maſters of ſculpture: for it is certainly much harder to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0566001100:24"/>
model from a figure in ſtrong, momentary action, which muſt, as it were, be ſhot flying; than from one, ſitting, or ſtanding, which the artiſt may copy at leiſure. Amidſt the variety of ſtatues tranſmitted from their hands, we have only three, or four in very ſpirited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Tho there are only perhaps two or three of the firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique ſtatues in <hi>very ſpirited</hi> action—the Laocoon, the fighting gladiator, and the boxers—yet there are ſeveral others, which are <hi>in action</hi>—the Apollo Belvidere—Michael Angelo's Torſo— Arria and Paetus—the Pietas militaris, ſometimes called the Ajax, of which the Paſquin at Rome is a part, and of which there is a repetition more intire, tho ſtill much mutilated, at Florence—the Alexander, and Bucephalus; and perhaps ſome others, which occur not to my memory. The paucity however of them, even if a longer catalogue could be produced, I think, ſhews that the ancient ſculptors conſidered the repreſentation of <hi>ſpirited action</hi> as an atchievement. The moderns have been leſs daring in attempting it. But I believe connoiſſeurs univerſally give the preference to thoſe ſtatues, in which the great maſters have ſo ſucceſsfully exhibited animated action.</p>
                     </note>
Yet when we ſee an effect of this kind well executed, our admiration is greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. Who does not admire the Laocoon more than the Antinous?</p>
                  <p>Animal life, as well as human, is, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, beautiful both in nature, and on canvas. We admire the horſe, as a <hi>real object;</hi> the elegance of his form; the ſtatelineſs of his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0566001100:25"/>
tread; the ſpirit of all his motions; and the gloſſineſs of his coat. We admire him alſo in <hi>repreſentation.</hi> But as an object of pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque beauty, we admire more the worn-out cart-horſe, the cow, the goat, or the aſs; whoſe harder lines, and rougher coats, exhibit more the graces of the pencil. For the truth of this we may examine Berghem's pictures: we may examine the ſmart touch of Roſa of Tivoli. The lion with his rough mane; the briſtly boar; and the ruffled plumage of the eagle<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>The idea of the <hi>ruffled plumage of the eagle</hi> is taken from the celebrated eagle of Pindar, in his firſt Pythian ode; which has exerciſed the pens of ſeveral poets; and is equally poetical, and pictureſque. He is introduced as an inſtance of the power of muſic. In Gray's ode on the progreſs of poeſy we have the following picture of him.
<q>
                              <l>Perching on the ſceptered hand</l>
                              <l>Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feathered king</l>
                              <l>With ruffled plumes, and flagging wing:</l>
                              <l>Quenched in dark clouds of ſlumber lie</l>
                              <l>The terror of his beak, and lightening of his eye.</l>
                           </q>
Akenſide's picture of him, in his hymn to the Naiads, is rather a little ſtiffly painted.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0566001100:26"/>
animals could not produce ſo pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque an effect.</p>
                  <p>But when the painter thus prefers the cart-horſe, the cow, or the aſs to other objects <hi>more beautiful in themſelves,</hi> he does not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly recommend his art to thoſe, whoſe love of beauty makes them anxiouſly ſeek, by what means it's fleeting forms may be fixed.</p>
                  <p>Suggeſtions of this kind are ungrateful. The art of painting allows you all you wiſh. You deſire to have a beautiful object painted— your horſe, for inſtance, led out of the ſtable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0566001100:27"/>
in all his pampered beauty. The art of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ready to accommodate you. You have the beautiful form you admired in nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly transferred to canvas. Be then ſatisfied. The art of painting has given you what you wanted. It is no injury to the beauty of your Arabian, if the painter think he could have given the graces of his art more forcibly to your cart-horſe.</p>
                  <p>But does it not depreciate his art, if he give up a beautiful form, for one leſs beautiful, merely becauſe he could have given it <hi>the graces of his art more forcibly</hi>—becauſe it's ſharp lines afford him a greater facility of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Is the ſmart touch of a pencil the grand deſideratum of painting? Does he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover nothing in <hi>pictureſque objects,</hi> but qualities, which admit of being <hi>rendered with ſpirit?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould not vindicate him, if he did. At the ſame time, a free execution is ſo very faſcinating a part of painting, that we need not wonder, if the artiſt lay a great ſtreſs upon it.—It is not however intirely owing, as ſome imagine, to the difficulty of maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an elegant line, that he prefers a rough one. In part indeed this may be the caſe;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0566001100:28"/>
for if an elegant line be not delicately hit off, it is the moſt inſipid of all lines: whereas in the deſcription of a rough object, an error in delineation is not eaſily ſeen. However this is not the whole of the matter. A free, bold touch is in itſelf pleaſing.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>A ſtroke may be called <hi>free,</hi> when there is no appearance of conſtraint. It is <hi>bold,</hi> when a part is given for the whole, which it cannot fail of ſuggeſting. This is the laconiſm of genius. But ſometimes it may be free, and yet ſuggeſt only how eaſily a line, which means nothing, may be executed. Such a ſtroke is not <hi>bold,</hi> but <hi>impudent.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note> In elegant figures indeed there muſt be a delicate outline—at leaſt a line true to nature: yet the ſurfaces even of ſuch figures may be touched with freedom; and in the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages of the compoſition there muſt be a mixture of rougher objects, or there will be a want of contraſt. In landſcape univerſally the rougher objects are admired; which give the freeſt ſcope to execution. If the pencil be timid, or heſitating, little beauty reſults. The execution then only is pleaſing, when the hand firm, and yet deciſive, freely touches the characteriſtic parts of each object.</p>

                  <p>It is not however merely for the ſake of his <hi>execution,</hi> that the artiſt values a rough object. He finds it in many other reſpects accommodated to his art. In the firſt place, his <hi>compoſition</hi> requires it. If the hiſtory-painter threw all his draperies ſmooth over his figures, his groups, and combinations would be very awkward. And in <hi>landſcape-painting</hi> ſmooth objects would produce no compoſition at all. In a mountain-ſcene what compoſition could ariſe from the corner of a ſmooth knoll coming forward on one ſide, interſected by a ſmooth knoll on the other; with a ſmooth plain perhaps in the middle, and a ſmooth mountain in the diſtance. The very idea is diſguſting. Pictureſque compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition conſiſts in uniting in one whole a variety of parts; and theſe parts can only be obtained from rough objects. If the ſmooth moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and plains were broken by different objects, the compoſition might be good, on a ſuppoſition the great lines of it were ſo before.</p>

                  <p>From <hi>rough</hi> objects alſo he ſeeks the <hi>effect of light and ſhade,</hi> which they are as well diſpoſed to produce, as they are the beauty of compoſition. One uniform light, or one uniform ſhade produces no effect. It is the various ſurfaces of objects, ſometimes turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the light in one way, and ſometimes in another, that give the painter his choice of opportunities in maſſing, and graduating both his lights, and ſhades.—The <hi>richneſs</hi> alſo of the light depends on the breaks, and little receſſes, which it finds on the ſurfaces of bodies. What the painter calls <hi>richneſs</hi> on a ſurface, is only a variety of little parts; on which the light ſhining, ſhews all it's ſmall inequalities, and roughneſſes; and in the painter's language, <hi>inriches</hi> it.—The beauty alſo of <hi>catching lights</hi> ariſes from the roughneſs of objects. What the painter calls a <hi>catching light</hi> is a ſtrong touch of light
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0566001100:34"/>
on ſome prominent part of a ſurface, while the reſt is in ſhadow. A ſmooth ſurface has no ſuch prominences.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>colouring</hi> alſo, <hi>rough</hi> objects give the painter another advantage. Smooth bodies are commonly as uniform in their colour, as they are in their ſurface. In gloſſy objects, tho ſmooth, the colouring may ſometimes vary. In general however it is otherwiſe; in the objects of landſcape, particularly. The ſmooth ſide of a hill is generally of one uniform colour; while the fractured rock preſents it's grey ſurface, adorned with patches of greenſward running down it's guttered ſides; and the broken ground is every where varied with an okery tint, a grey gravel, or a leaden-coloured clay: ſo that in fact the rich colours of the ground ariſe generally from it's broken ſurface.</p>
                  <p>From ſuch reaſoning then we infer, that it is not merely for the ſake of his <hi>execution,</hi> that the painter prefers <hi>rough</hi> objects to <hi>ſmooth.</hi> The very eſſence of his art requires it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0566001100:35"/>As pictureſque beauty therefore ſo greatly depends on <hi>rough</hi> objects, are we to exclude every idea of <hi>ſmoothneſs</hi> from mixing with it? Are we ſtruck with no pleaſing image, when the lake is ſpread upon the canvas; the <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreum aequor,</hi> pure, limpid, ſmooth, as the poliſhed mirror?</p>
                  <p>We acknowledge it to be pictureſque: but we muſt at the ſame time recollect, that, in fact, the ſmoothneſs of the lake is more in <hi>reality,</hi> than in <hi>appearance.</hi> Were it ſpread upon the canvas in one ſimple hue, it would certainly be a dull, fatiguing object. But to the eye it appears broken by ſhades of various kinds; by the undulations of the water; or by reflections from all the rough objects in it's neighbourhood.</p>
                  <p>It is thus too in other gloſſy bodies. Tho the horſe, in a <hi>rough</hi> ſtate, as we have juſt obſerved, or worn down with labour, is more adapted to the pencil, than when his ſides ſhine with bruſhing, and high-feeding; yet in this latter ſtate alſo he is certainly a pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque object. But it is not his ſmooth, and ſhining coat, that makes him ſo. It is the apparent interruption of that ſmoothneſs by a variety of ſhades, and colours, which produces
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0566001100:36"/>
the effect. Such a play of muſcles appears, every where, through the fineneſs of his ſkin, gently ſwelling, and ſinking into each other— he is all over ſo <hi>lubricus aſpici,</hi> the reflections of light are ſo continually ſhifting upon him, and playing into each other, that the eye never conſiders the ſmoothneſs of the ſurface; but is amuſed with gliding up, and down, among theſe endleſs tranſitions, which in ſome degree, ſupply the room of <hi>roughneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is thus too in the plumage of birds. Nothing can be ſofter, nothing ſmoother to the touch; and yet it is certainly pictureſque. But it is not the ſmoothneſs of the ſurface, which produces the effect—it is not this we admire: it is the breaking of the colours: it is the bright green, or purple, changing perhaps into a rich azure, or velvet black; from thence taking a ſemitint; and ſo on through all the varieties of colour. Or if the colour be not changeable, it is the harmony we admire in theſe elegant little touches of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's pencil. The ſmoothneſs of the ſurface is only the ground of the colours. In itſelf we admire it no more, than we do the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the canvas, which receives the colours of the picture. Even the plumage of the ſwan,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0566001100:37"/>
which to the inaccurate obſerver appears only of one ſimple hue, is in fact varied with a thouſand ſoft ſhadows, and brilliant touches, at once diſcoverable to the pictureſque eye.</p>
                  <p>Thus too a piece of poliſhed marble may be pictureſque; but it is only, when the poliſh brings out beautiful veins, which in <hi>appearance</hi> break the ſurface by a variety of lines, and colours. Let the marble be perfectly white, and the effect vaniſhes. Thus alſo a mirror may have pictureſque beauty; but it is only from it's reflections. In an unreflecting ſtate, it is inſipid.</p>
                  <p>In ſtatuary we ſometimes ſee an inferior artiſt give his marble a gloſs, thinking to atone for his bad workmanſhip by his excellent poliſh. The effect ſhews in how ſmall a degree ſmoothneſs enters into the idea of the pictureſque. When the light plays on the ſhining coat of a pampered horſe, it plays among the lines, and muſcles of nature; and is therefore founded in truth. But the poliſh of marble-fleſh is unnatural<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>On all human fleſh held between the eye and the light, there is a degree of poliſh. I ſpeak not here of ſuch a poliſh
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0566001100:38"/>as this, which wrought marble always, in a degree, poſſeſſes, as well as human fleſh; but of the higheſt poliſh, which can be given to marble; and which has always a very bad effect. If I wanted an example, the buſt of arch-biſhop Boulter in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-abbey would afford a very glaring one.</p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0566001100:37"/>
                     </note>. The lights
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0566001100:38"/>
therefore are falſe; and ſmoothneſs being here one of the chief qualities to admire, we are diſguſted; and ſay, it makes bad, worſe.</p>
                  <p>After all, we mean not to aſſert, that even a ſimple ſmooth ſurface is in no ſituation pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque. In <hi>contraſt</hi> it certainly may be: nay in contraſt it is often neceſſary. The beauty of an old head is greatly improved by the ſmoothneſs of the bald pate; and the rougher parts of the rock muſt neceſſarily be ſet off with the ſmoother. But the point lies here: to make an object in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pictureſque, there <hi>muſt be</hi> a proportion of <hi>roughneſs;</hi> ſo much at leaſt, as to make an oppoſition; which in an object ſimply beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, is unneceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Some quibbling opponent may throw out, that wherever there is ſmoothneſs, there muſt alſo be roughneſs. The ſmootheſt plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of many rougher parts; and the rougheſt rock of many ſmoother; and there is ſuch a variety of degrees in both, that it is hard to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0566001100:39"/>
ſay, where you have the preciſe ideas of <hi>rough,</hi> and <hi>ſmooth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this it is enough, that the province of the pictureſque eye is to <hi>ſurvey nature;</hi> not to <hi>anatomize matter.</hi> It throws it's glances around in the broad-caſt ſtile. It comprehends an extenſive tract at each ſweep. It examines <hi>parts,</hi> but never deſcends to <hi>particles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus from a variety of examples en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſhew, that <hi>roughneſs</hi> either <hi>real,</hi> or <hi>apparent,</hi> forms an eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>beautiful,</hi> and the <hi>pictureſque;</hi> it may be expected, that we ſhould point out the reaſon of this difference. It is obvious enough, why the painter prefers <hi>rough</hi> objects to <hi>ſmooth</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See page 19, &amp;c.</note>: but it is not ſo obvious, why the quality of <hi>roughneſs</hi> ſhould make an <hi>eſſential difference</hi> between the objects of <hi>nature,</hi> and the objects of <hi>artificial repreſentation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this queſtion, we might anſwer, that the pictureſque eye abhors art; and delights ſolely in nature: and that as art abounds with <hi>regularity,</hi> which is only another name
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0566001100:40"/>
for <hi>ſmoothneſs;</hi> and the images of nature with <hi>irregularity,</hi> which is only another name for <hi>roughneſs,</hi> we have here a ſolution of our queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But is this ſolution ſatisfactory? I fear not. Tho art often abounds with regularity, it does not follow, that all art muſt neceſſarily do ſo. The pictureſque eye, it is true, finds it's <hi>chief</hi> objects in nature; but it delights alſo in the images of art, if they are marked with the characteriſtics, which it requires. <hi>A painter's nature</hi> is whatever he <hi>imitates;</hi> whether the object be what is commonly called natural, or artificial. Is there a greater ornament of landſcape, than the ruins of a caſtle? What painter rejects it, becauſe it is artificial?—What beautiful effects does Vandervelt produce from ſhipping? In the hands of ſuch a maſter it furniſhes almoſt as beautiful forms, as any in the whole circle of pictureſque objects?—And what could the hiſtory-painter do, without his draperies to combine, contraſt, and harmonize his figures? Uncloathed, they could never be grouped. How could he tell his ſtory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arms; religious utenſils; and the rich furniture of banquets? Many of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0566001100:41"/>
greatly to embelliſh his pictures with pleaſing ſhapes.</p>
                  <p>Shall we then ſeek the ſolution of our queſtion in the great foundation of pictureſque beauty? in the <hi>happy union of ſimplicity and variety;</hi> to which the <hi>rough</hi> ideas eſſentially contribute. An extended plain is a ſimple object. It is the continuation only of one uniform idea. But the mere <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of a plain produces no beauty. Break the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of it, as you did your pleaſure-ground; add trees, rocks, and declivities; that is, give it <hi>roughneſs,</hi> and you give it alſo <hi>variety.</hi> Thus by inriching the <hi>parts</hi> of a united <hi>whole</hi> with <hi>roughneſs,</hi> you obtain the combined idea of <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> and <hi>variety;</hi> from whence reſults the pictureſque.—Is this a ſatisfactory anſwer to our queſtion?</p>
                  <p>By no means. <hi>Simplicity and variety</hi> are ſources of the <hi>beautiful,</hi> as well as of the <hi>pictureſque.</hi> Why does the architect break the front of his pile with ornaments? Is it not to add variety to ſmplicity? Even the very black-ſmith acknowledges this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple by forming ringlets, and bulbous circles on his tongs, and pokers. In nature it is the ſame; and your plain will juſt as much
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0566001100:42"/>
be improved <hi>in reality</hi> by breaking it, as <hi>upon canvas.</hi>—In a garden-ſcene the idea is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. There every object is of the neat, and elegant kind. What is otherwiſe, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harmonious, and <hi>roughneſs</hi> would be diſorder.</p>
                  <p>Shall we then change our ground; and ſeek an anſwer to our queſtion in the nature of the art of painting? As it is an art <hi>ſtrictly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,</hi> thoſe objects will of courſe appear moſt advantageouſly to the pictureſque eye, which are the moſt eaſily imitated. The ſtronger the features are, the ſtronger will be the effect of imitation; and as rough objects have the ſtrongeſt features, they will conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, when repreſented, appear to moſt advantage.—Is this anſwer more ſatisfactory?</p>
                  <p>Very little, in truth. Every painter, knows that a ſmooth object may be as eaſily, and as well imitated, as a rough one.</p>
                  <p>Shall we then take an oppoſite ground, and ſay juſt the reverſe (as men preſſed with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties will ſay any thing) that painting is <hi>not</hi> an art <hi>ſtrictly imitative,</hi> but rather <hi>deceptive</hi> —that by an aſſemblage of colours, and a peculiar art in ſpreading them, the painter gives a ſemblance of nature at a proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; which at hand, is quite another thing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0566001100:43"/>
—that thoſe objects, which we call pictureſque, are only ſuch as are more adapted to this art —and that as this art is moſt concealed in rough touches, rough objects are of courſe the moſt pictureſque.—Have we now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſatisfactory account of the matter?</p>
                  <p>Juſt as much ſo, as before. Many painters of note did not uſe the rough ſtile of painting; and yet their pictures are as admirable, as the pictures of thoſe, who did: nor are rough objects leſs pictureſque on their canvas, than on the canvas of others: that is, they paint rough objects ſmoothly.</p>
                  <p>Thus foiled, ſhall we in the true ſpirit of inquiry, perſiſt; or honeſtly give up the cauſe, and own we cannot ſearch out the ſource of this difference? I am afraid this is the truth, whatever airs of dogmatizing we may aſſume. Inquiries into <hi>principles</hi> rarely end in ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Could we even gain ſatisfaction in our preſent queſtion, new doubts would ariſe. The very firſt principles of our art would be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Difficulties would ſtart up <hi>veſtibulum ante ipſum.</hi> We ſhould be aſked, What is beauty? What is taſte?—Let us ſtep aſide a moment, and liſten to the debates of the learned on theſe heads. They will at leaſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0566001100:44"/>
ſhew us, that however we may wiſh to ſix <hi>principles,</hi> our inquiries are ſeldom ſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>One philoſopher will tell us, that taſte is only the improvement of our own ideas. Every man has naturally his proportion of taſte. The ſeeds of it are innate. All depends on culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>Another philoſopher following the analogy of nature, obſerves, that as all mens faces are different, we may well ſuppoſe their minds to be ſo likewiſe. He rejects the idea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of innate taſte; and in the room of this makes <hi>utility</hi> the ſtandard both of taſte, and beauty.</p>
                  <p>Another philoſopher thinks the idea of <hi>utility</hi> as abſurd, as the laſt did that of <hi>innate taſte.</hi> What, cries he, can I not admire the beauty of a reſplendent ſun-ſet, till I have inveſtigated the <hi>utility</hi> of that peculiar radiance in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere? He then wiſhes we had a little leſs philoſophy amongſt us, and a little more common ſenſe. <hi>Common ſenſe</hi> is deſpiſed like other common things: but, in his opinion, if we made <hi>common ſenſe</hi> the criterion in matters of art, as well as ſcience, we ſhould be nearer the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0566001100:45"/>A fourth philoſopher apprehends <hi>common ſenſe</hi> to be our ſtandard only in the ordinary affairs of life. The bounty of nature has furniſhed us with various other ſenſes ſuited to the objects, among which we converſe: and with regard to matters of taſte, it has ſupplied us with what, he doubts not, we all feel within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>a ſenſe of beauty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pooh! ſays another learned inquirer, what is a <hi>ſenſe of beauty? Senſe</hi> is a vague idea, and ſo is <hi>beauty;</hi> and it is impoſſible that any thing determined can reſult from terms ſo inaccurate. But if we lay aſide a <hi>ſenſe of beauty,</hi> and adopt <hi>proportion,</hi> we ſhall all be right. <hi>Proportion</hi> is the great principle of taſte, and beauty. We admit it both in lines, and colours; and indeed refer all our ideas of the elegant kind to it's ſtandard.</p>
                  <p>True, ſays an admirer of the antique; but this proportion muſt have a rule, or we gain nothing: and a <hi>rule of proportion</hi> there cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is: but we may inquire after it in vain. The ſecret is loſt. The ancients had it. They well knew the principles of beauty; and had that unerring rule, which in all things adjuſted their taſte. We ſee it even in their ſlighteſt vaſes. In <hi>their</hi> works, proportion, tho varied
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0566001100:46"/>
through a thouſand lines, is ſtill the ſame; and if we could only diſcover their <hi>principles of proportion,</hi> we ſhould have the arcanum of this ſcience; and might ſettle all our diſputes about taſte with great eaſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus, in our inquiries into <hi>firſt principles,</hi> we go on, without end, and without ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. The human underſtanding is unequal to the ſearch. In philoſophy we inquire for them in vain—in phyſics—in metaphyſics—in morals. Even in the polite arts, where the ſubject, one ſhould imagine, is leſs recondite, the inquiry, we find, is equally vague. We are puzzled, and bewildered; but not informed. All is uncertainty; a ſtrife of words; the old conteſt, <q>Empedocles, an Stertinii deliret acumen?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, if <hi>a cauſe be ſufficiently underſtood,</hi> it may ſuggeſt uſeful diſcoveries. But if it be <hi>not ſo</hi> (and where is our certainty in theſe diſquiſitions) it will unqueſtionably <hi>miſlead.</hi>

                        <p>Tho I read now but little, yet I have read with great attention the eſſay, which you was ſo good to put into my hands, on the difference between the <hi>beautiful,</hi> and the <hi>pictureſque;</hi> and I may truly ſay, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from it much pleaſure, and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Without oppoſing any of your ſentiments, it has ſuggeſted an idea, that may be worth conſideration—whether the epithet <hi>pictureſque</hi> is not applicable to the excellences of the inferior ſchools, rather than to the higher.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0566001100:48"/>
The works of Michael Angelo, Raphael, &amp;c. appear to me to have nothing of it; whereas Reubens, and the Venetian painters may almoſt be ſaid to have nothing elſe.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps <hi>pictureſque</hi> is ſomewhat ſynonymous to the word <hi>taſte;</hi> which we ſhould think im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly applied to Homer, or Milton, but very well to Pope, or Prior. I ſuſpect that the application of theſe words are to excellences of an inferior order; and which are incompatible with the grand ſtile.</p>
                        <p>You are certainly right in ſaying, that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of tints and forms is pictureſque; but it muſt be remembred, on the other hand, that the reverſe of this—(uniformity of colour, and a long continuation of lines,) produces gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.</p>
                        <p>I had an intention of pointing out the paſſages, that particularly ſtruck me; but I was afraid to uſe my eyes ſo much.</p>

                           <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I am much obliged to you for looking over my eſſay at a time, when the complaint in your eyes muſt have made an intruſion of this kind troubleſome. But as the ſubject was rather novel, I wiſhed much for your ſanction; and you have given it me in as flattering a manner, as I could wiſh.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the term <hi>pictureſque,</hi> I have always myſelf uſed it merely to denote <hi>ſuch objects, as are proper ſubjects for painting:</hi>
                           <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0566001100:52"/>
ſo that, according to <hi>my definition,</hi> one of the cartoons, and a flower-piece are equally pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turesque.</p>
                        <p>I think however I underſtand your idea of extending the term to what may be called <hi>taſte in painting</hi>—or the art of faſcinating the eye by ſplendid colouring, and artificial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations; which the inferior ſchools valued; and the dignity of the higher perhaps deſpiſed. But I have ſeen ſo little of the higher ſchools, that I ſhould be very ill able to carry the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject farther by illuſtrating a diſquiſition of this kind. Except the cartoons, I never ſaw a picture of Raphael's, that anſwered my idea; and of the original works of Michael Angelo I have little conception.</p>
                        <p>But tho I am unable, through ignorance, to appreciate fully the grandeur of the Roman ſchool, I have at leaſt the pleaſure to find I have always held as a principle your idea of the production of greatneſs by <hi>uniformity of colour, and a long continuation of line:</hi> and when I ſpeak of <hi>variety,</hi> I certainly do not mean to confound it's effects with thoſe of <hi>grandeur.</hi>

                  <p>ENOUGH has been ſaid to ſhew the difficulty of <hi>aſſigning cauſes:</hi> let us then take another courſe, and amuſe ourſelves with <hi>ſearching after effects.</hi> This is the general intention of pictureſque travel. We mean not to bring it into competition with any of the more uſeful ends of travelling: but as many travel without any end at all, amuſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without being able to give a reaſon why they are amuſed, we offer an end, which may poſſibly engage ſome vacant minds; and may indeed afford a rational amuſement to ſuch as travel for more important purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>In treating of pictureſque travel, we may conſider firſt it's <hi>object;</hi> and ſecondly it's ſources of <hi>amuſement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0566001100:55"/>It's <hi>object</hi> is beauty of every kind, which either art, or nature can produce: but it is chiefly that ſpecies of <hi>pictureſque beauty,</hi> which we have endeavoured to characterize in the preceding eſſay. This great object we purſue through the ſcenery of nature; and examine it by the rules of painting. We ſeek it among all the ingredients of landſcape—trees—rocks —broken-grounds—woods—rivers—lakes— plains—vallies—mountains—and diſtances. Theſe objects <hi>in themſelves</hi> produce infinite variety. No two rocks, or trees are exactly the ſame. They are varied, a ſecond time, by <hi>combination;</hi> and almoſt as much, a third time, by different <hi>lights, and ſhades,</hi> and other aerial effects. Sometimes we find among them the exhibition of <hi>a whole;</hi> but oftener we find only beautiful <hi>parts.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>As ſome of theſe topics have been occaſionally men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in other pictureſque works, which the author has given the public, they are here touched very ſlightly: only the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject required they ſhould be brought together.</p>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we may examine pictureſque objects with more eaſe, it may be uſeful to claſs them into the <hi>ſublime,</hi> and the <hi>beautiful;</hi> tho, in fact, this diſtinction is rather inaccurate.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0566001100:56"/>
                     <hi>Sublimity alone</hi> cannot make an object <hi>pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque.</hi> However grand the mountain, or the rock may be, it has no claim to this epithet, unleſs it's form, it's colour, or it's accompaniments have <hi>ſome degree of beauty.</hi> Nothing can be more ſublime, than the ocean: but wholly unaccompanied, it has little of the pictureſque. When we talk therefore of a ſublime object, we always underſtand, that it is alſo beautiful: and we call it ſublime, or beautiful, only as the ideas of ſublimity, or of ſimple beauty prevail.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>curious,</hi> and <hi>fantaſtic</hi> forms of nature are by no means the favourite objects of the lovers of landſcape. There may be beauty in a <hi>curious</hi> object; and ſo far it may be pictureſque: but we cannot admire it merely for the ſake of it's curioſity. The <hi>luſus naturae</hi> is the naturaliſt's province, not the painter's. The ſpiry pinnacles of the mountain, and the caſtle-like arrangement of the rock, give no peculiar pleaſure to the pictureſque eye. It is fond of the ſimplicity of nature; and ſees moſt beauty in her <hi>moſt uſual</hi> forms. The <hi>Giant's cauſeway</hi> in Ireland may ſtrike it as a novelty; but the lake of Killarney attracts it's attention. It would range with ſupreme
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0566001100:57"/>
delight among the ſweet vales of Switzerland; but would view only with a tranſient glance, the Glaciers of Savoy. Scenes of this kind, as unuſual, may pleaſe <hi>once;</hi> but the great works of nature, in her ſimpleſt and pureſt ſtile, open inexhauſted ſprings of amuſement.</p>
                  <p>But it is not only the <hi>form,</hi> and the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> of the objects of landſcape, which the pictureſque eye examines; it connects them with the atmoſphere, and ſeeks for all thoſe various effects, which are produced from that vaſt, and wonderful ſtorehouſe of nature. Nor is there in travelling a greater pleaſure, than when a ſcene of grandeur burſts unexpectedly upon the eye, accompanied with ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental circumſtance of the atmoſphere, which harmonizes with it, and gives it double value.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the <hi>inanimate</hi> face of nature, it's <hi>living forms</hi> fall under the pictureſque eye, in the courſe of travel; and are often objects of great attention. The anatomical ſtudy of figures is not attended to: we regard them merely as the ornament of ſcenes. In the human figure we contemplate neither <hi>exactneſs of form;</hi> nor <hi>expreſſion,</hi> any farther than it is ſhewn in <hi>action:</hi> we merely conſider general ſhapes, dreſſes, groups, and occupations; which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0566001100:58"/>
we often find <hi>caſually</hi> in greater variety, and beauty, than any ſelection can procure.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner animals are the objects of our attention, whether we find them in the park, the foreſt, or the field. Here too we conſider little more, than their general forms, actions, and combinations. Nor is the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque eye ſo faſtidious as to deſpiſe even leſs conſiderable objects. A flight of birds has often a pleaſing effect. In ſhort, every form of life, and being has it's uſe as a pictureſque object, till it become too ſmall for attention.</p>
                  <p>But the pictureſque eye is not merely reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricted to nature. It ranges through the limits of art. The picture, the ſtatue, and the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den are all the objects of it's attention. In the embelliſhed pleaſure-ground particularly, tho all is neat, and elegant—far too neat and elegant for the uſe of the pencil; yet, if it be well laid out, it exhibits the <hi>lines,</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> of landſcape; and is well worth the ſtudy of the pictureſque traveller. Nothing is wanting, but what his imagination can ſupply—a change from ſmooth to rough.<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 8.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0566001100:59"/>But among all the objects of art, the pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque eye is perhaps moſt inquiſitive after the elegant relics of ancient architecture; the ruined tower, the Gothic arch, the remains of caſtles, and abbeys. Theſe are the richeſt legacies of art. They are conſecrated by time; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſerve the veneration we pay to the works of nature itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus univerſal are the objects of pictureſque travel. We purſue <hi>beauty</hi> in every ſhape; through nature, through art; and all it's various arrangements in form, and colour; admiring it in the grandeſt objects, and not rejecting it in the humbleſt.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>objects</hi> of pictureſque travel, we conſider it's <hi>ſources of amuſement</hi>—or in what way the mind is gratified by theſe objects.</p>
                  <p>We might begin in moral ſtile; and conſider the objects of nature in a higher light, than merely as amuſement. We might obſerve, that a ſearch after beauty ſhould naturally lead the mind to the great origin of all beauty; to the <q>— firſt good, firſt perfect, and firſt fair.</q>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0566001100:60"/>
But tho in theory this ſeems a natural climax, we inſiſt the leſs upon it, as in fact we have ſcarce ground to hope, that every admirer of <hi>pictureſque beauty,</hi> is an admirer alſo of the <hi>beauty of virtue;</hi> and that every lover of nature reflects, that
<q>
                        <l>Nature is but a name for an <hi>effect,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Whoſe <hi>cauſe</hi> is God. —</l>
                     </q>
If however the admirer of nature can turn his amuſements to a higher purpoſe; if it's great ſcenes can inſpire him with religious awe; or it's tranquil ſcenes with that compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of mind, which is ſo nearly allied to benevolence, it is certainly the better. <hi>Appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat lucro.</hi> It is ſo much into the bargain: for we dare not <hi>promiſe</hi> him more from pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque travel, than a rational, and agreeable amuſement. Yet even this may be of ſome uſe in an age teeming with licentious pleaſure; and may in this light at leaſt be conſidered as having a moral tendency.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſource of amuſement to the pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque traveller, is the <hi>purſuit</hi> of his object— the expectation of new ſcenes continually open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ariſing to his view. We ſuppoſe the country to have been unexplored. Under this circumſtance the mind is kept conſtantly in an
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0566001100:61"/>
agreeable ſuſpence. The love of novelty is the foundation of this pleaſure. Every diſtant ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon promiſes ſomething new; and with this pleaſing expectation we follow nature through all her walks. We purſue her from hill to dale; and hunt after thoſe various beauties, with which ſhe every where abounds.</p>
                  <p>The pleaſures of the chaſe are univerſal. A hare ſtarted before dogs is enough to ſet a whole country in an uproar. The plough, and the ſpade are deſerted. Care is left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and every human faculty is dilated with joy.</p>
                  <p>And ſhall we ſuppoſe it a greater pleaſure to the ſportſman to purſue a trivial animal, than it is to the man of taſte to purſue the beauties of nature? to follow her through all her receſſes? to obtain a ſudden glance, as ſhe flits paſt him in ſome airy ſhape? to trace her through the mazes of the cover? to wind after her along the vale? or along the reaches of the river?</p>
                  <p>After the purſuit we are gratified with the <hi>attainment</hi> of the object. Our amuſement, on this head, ariſes from the employment of the mind in examining the beautiful ſcenes we have found. Sometimes we examine them under the idea of a <hi>whole:</hi> we admire the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0566001100:62"/>
the colouring, and the light, in one <hi>comprehenſive view.</hi> When we are fortunate enough to fall in with ſcenes of this kind, we are highly delighted. But as we have leſs frequent opportunities of being thus gratified, we are more commonly employed in analyzing the <hi>parts of ſcenes;</hi> which may be exquiſitely beautiful, tho unable to produce a whole. We examine what would amend the compoſition; how little is wanting to reduce it to the rules of our art; what a trifling circumſtance ſometimes forms the limit between beauty, and deformity. Or we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the objects before us with other objects of the ſame kind:—or perhaps we compare them with the imitations of art. From all theſe operations of the mind reſults great amuſement.</p>
                  <p>But it is not from this <hi>ſcientifical</hi> employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we derive our chief pleaſure. We are moſt delighted, when ſome grand ſcene, tho perhaps of incorrect compoſition, riſing before the eye, ſtrikes us beyond the power of thought—when the <hi>vox faucibus haeret;</hi> and every mental operation is ſuſpended. In this pauſe of intellect; this <hi>deliquium</hi> of the ſoul, an enthuſiaſtic ſenſation of pleaſure overſpreads
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0566001100:63"/>
it, previous to any examination by the rules of art. The general idea of the ſcene makes an impreſſion, before any appeal is made to the judgment. We rather <hi>feel,</hi> than <hi>ſurvey</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>This high delight is generally indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſcenes of nature; yet ſometimes by artificial objects. Here and there a capital picture will raiſe theſe emotions: but oftener the rough ſketch of a capital maſter. This has ſometimes an aſtoniſhing effect on the mind; giving the imagination an opening into all thoſe glowing ideas, which inſpired the artiſt; and which the imagination <hi>only</hi> can tranſlate. In general however the works of art affect us coolly; and allow the eye to cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticize at leiſure.</p>
                  <p>Having gained by a minute examination of incidents a compleat idea of an object, our next amuſement ariſes from inlarging, and correcting our general ſtock of ideas. The variety of nature is ſuch, that <hi>new objects,</hi> and new combinations of them, are continually adding ſomething to our fund, and inlarging our collection: while the <hi>ſame kind of object</hi> occurring frequently, is ſeen under various ſhapes; and makes us, if I may ſo ſpeak, more learned in nature. We get it more by heart.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0566001100:64"/>
He who has ſeen only one oak-tree, has no compleat idea of an oak in general: but he who has examined thouſands of oak-trees, muſt have ſeen that beautiful plant in all it's va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties; and obtains a full, and compleat idea of it.</p>
                  <p>From this correct knowledge of objects ariſes another amuſement; that of repreſenting, by a few ſtrokes in a ſketch, thoſe ideas, which have made the moſt impreſſion upon us. A few ſcratches, like a ſhort-hand ſcrawl of our own, legible at leaſt to ourſelves, will ſerve to raiſe in our minds the remembrance of the beauties they humbly repreſent; and recal to our memory even the ſplendid colouring, and force of light, which exiſted in the real ſcene. Some naturaliſts ſuppoſe, the act of rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in animals, to be attended with more pleaſure, than the act of groſſer maſtication. It may be ſo in travelling alſo. There may be more pleaſure in recollecting, and record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from a few tranſient lines, the ſcenes we have admired, than in the preſent enjoyment of them. If the ſcenes indeed have <hi>peculiar greatneſs,</hi> this ſecondary pleaſure cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with thoſe enthuſiaſtic feelings, which accompanied the real exhibition. But, in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0566001100:65"/>
general, tho it may be a calmer ſpecies of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it is more uniform, and uninterrupted. It flatters us too with the idea of a ſort of creation of our own; and it is unallayed with that fatigue, which is often a conſiderable abatement to the pleaſures of traverſing the wild, and ſavage parts of nature.—After we have amuſed <hi>ourſelves</hi> with our ſketches, if we can, in any degree, contribute to the amuſement of others alſo, the pleaſure is ſurely ſo much inhanced.</p>
                  <p>There is ſtill another amuſement ariſing from the correct knowledge of objects; and that is the power of creating, and repreſenting <hi>ſcenes of fancy;</hi> which is ſtill more a work of creation, than copying from nature. The imagination becomes a camera obſcura, only with this difference, that the camera repreſents objects as they really are; while the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, impreſſed with the moſt beautiful ſcenes, and chaſtened by rules of art, forms it's pictures, not only from the moſt admirable parts of nature; but in the beſt taſte.</p>
                  <p>Some artiſts, when they give their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation play, let it looſe among uncommon ſcenes—ſuch as perhaps never exiſted: whereas the nearer they approach the ſimple ſtandard
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0566001100:66"/>
of nature, in it's moſt beautiful forms, the more admirable their fictions will appear. It is thus in writing romances. The correct taſte cannot bear thoſe unnatural ſituations, in which heroes, and heroines are often placed: whereas a ſtory, <hi>naturally,</hi> and of courſe <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectingly</hi> told, either with a pen, or a pencil, tho known to be a fiction, is conſidered as a tranſcript from nature; and takes poſſeſſion of the heart. The <hi>marvellous</hi> diſguſts the ſober imagination; which is gratified only with the pure characters of nature.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Beauty beſt is taught</l>
                     <l>By thoſe, the favoured few, whom heaven has lent</l>
                     <l>The power to ſeize, ſelect, and reunite</l>
                     <l>Her lovelieſt features; and of theſe to form</l>
                     <l>One archetype compleat, of ſovereign grace.</l>
                     <l>Here nature ſees her faireſt forms more fair;</l>
                     <l>Owns them as hers, yet owns herſelf excelled</l>
                     <l>By what herſelf produced.—</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But if we are unable to embody our ideas even in a humble ſketch, yet ſtill a ſtrong <hi>impreſſion of nature</hi> will enable us to judge of the <hi>works of art.</hi> Nature is the archetype. The ſtronger therefore the impreſſion, the better the judgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0566001100:67"/>We are, in ſome degree, alſo amuſed by the very viſions of fancy itſelf. Often, when ſlumber has half-cloſed the eye, and ſhut out all the objects of ſenſe, eſpecially after the enjoyment of ſome ſplendid ſcene; the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, active, and alert, collects it's ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ideas, tranſpoſes, combines, and ſhifts them into a thouſand forms, producing ſuch exquiſite ſcenes, ſuch ſublime arrangements, ſuch glow, and harmony of colouring, ſuch brilliant lights, ſuch depth, and clearneſs of ſhadow, as equally foil deſcription, and every attempt of artificial colouring.</p>
                  <p>It may perhaps be objected to the pleaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able circumſtances, which are thus ſaid to attend pictureſque travel, that we meet as many diſguſting, as pleaſing objects; and the man of taſte therefore will be as often offended, as amuſed.</p>
                  <p>But this is not the caſe. There are few parts of nature, which do not yield a pictureſque eye ſome amuſement.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Believe the muſe,</l>
                     <l>She does not know that unauſpicious ſpot,</l>
                     <l>Where beauty is thus niggard of her ſtore.</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0566001100:68"/>Believe the muſe, through this terreſtrial waſte</l>
                     <l>The ſeeds of grace are ſown, profuſely ſown,</l>
                     <l>Even where we leaſt may hope.—</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>It is true, when ſome large tract of barren country <hi>interrupts</hi> our expectation, wound up in queſt of any particular ſcene of grandeur, or beauty, we are apt to be a little peeviſh; and to expreſs our diſcontent in haſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated phraſe. But when there is no diſappointment in the caſe, even ſcenes the moſt barren of beauty, will furniſh amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps no part of England comes more under this deſcription, than that tract of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren country, through which the great military road paſſes from Newcaſtle to Carliſle. It is a waſte, with little interruption, through a ſpace of forty miles. But even here, we have always ſomething to amuſe the eye. The interchangeable patches of heath, and green-ſward make an agreeable variety. Often too on theſe vaſt tracts of interſecting grounds we ſee beautiful lights, ſoftening off along the ſides of hills: and often we ſee them adorned with cattle, flocks of ſheep, heath-cocks, grous, plover, and flights of other wild-fowl. A group of cattle, ſtanding in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0566001100:69"/>
the ſhade on the edge of a dark hill, and relieved by a lighter diſtance beyond them, will often make a compleat picture without any other accompaniment. In many other ſituations alſo we find them wonderfully pleaſing; and capable of making pictures amidſt all the deficiences of landſcape. Even a winding road itſelf is an object of beauty; while the richneſs of the heath on each ſide, with the little hillocs, and crumbling earth give many an excellent leſſon for a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground. When we have no opportunity of examining the <hi>grand ſcenery</hi> of nature, we have every where at leaſt the means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving with what a <hi>multiplicity of parts,</hi> and yet with what <hi>general ſimplicity,</hi> ſhe covers every ſurface.</p>
                  <p>But if we let the <hi>imagination</hi> looſe, even ſcenes like theſe, adminiſter great amuſement. The imagination can plant hills; can form rivers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lakes in vallies; can build caſtles, and abbeys; and if it find no other amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can dilate itſelf in vaſt ideas of ſpace.</p>
                  <p>But altho the pictureſque traveller is ſeldom diſappointed with <hi>pure nature,</hi> however rude,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0566001100:70"/>
yet we cannot deny, but he is often offended with the productions of art. He is diſguſted with the formal ſeparations of property—with houſes, and towns, the haunts of men, which have much oftener a bad effect in landſcape, than a good one. He is frequently diſguſted alſo, when art aims more at beauty, than ſhe ought. How flat, and inſipid is often the garden-ſcene! how puerile, and abſurd! the banks of the river how ſmooth, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel! the lawn, and it's boundaries, how unlike nature! Even in the capital collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pictures, how ſeldom does he find <hi>deſign, compoſition, expreſſion, character,</hi> or <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> either in <hi>light,</hi> or <hi>colouring!</hi> and how often does he drag through ſaloons, and rooms of ſtate, only to hear a catalogue of the names of maſters!</p>
                  <p>The more refined our taſte grows from the <hi>ſtudy of nature,</hi> the more inſipid are the <hi>works of art.</hi> Few of it's efforts pleaſe. The idea of the great original is ſo ſtrong, that the copy muſt be very pure, if it do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. But the varieties of nature's charts are ſuch, that, ſtudy them as we can, new va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties will always ariſe: and let our taſte be ever ſo refined, her works, on which it is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0566001100:71"/>
formed (at leaſt when we conſider them as <hi>objects,</hi>) muſt always go beyond it; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh freſh ſources both of pleaſure and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>art of ſketching</hi> is to the pictureſque traveller, what the art of writing is to the ſcholar. Each is equally neceſſary to fix, and communicate it's reſpective ideas.</p>
                  <p>Sketches <hi>are</hi> either taken from the <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> or from <hi>nature.</hi>—When the <hi>imaginary ſketch</hi> proceeds from the hands of a maſter, it is very valuable. It is his firſt conception; which is commonly the ſtrongeſt, and the moſt brilliant. The imagination of a painter, really great in his profeſſion, is a magazine abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all the elegant forms, and ſtriking effects, which are to be found in nature. Theſe, like a magician, he calls up at pleaſure with a wave of his hand; bringing before the eye, ſometimes a ſcene from hiſtory, or ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0566001100:74"/>
and ſometimes from the inanimate parts of nature. And in theſe happy moments, when the enthuſiaſm of his art is upon him, he often produces from the glow of his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with a few bold ſtrokes, ſuch wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effuſions of genius, as the more ſober, and correct productions of his pencil cannot equal.</p>
                  <p>It will always however be underſtood, that ſuch ſketches muſt be <hi>examined</hi> alſo by an eye <hi>learned in the art,</hi> and accuſtomed to pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque ideas—an eye, that can take up the half-formed images, as the maſter leaves them; give them a new creation; and make up all that is not expreſſed from it's own ſtore-houſe. —I ſhall however dwell no longer on <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary ſketching,</hi> as it hath but little relation to my preſent ſubject. Let me only add, that altho this eſſay is meant chiefly to aſſiſt the pictureſque traveller in taking <hi>views from nature,</hi> the method recommended, as far as it relates to <hi>execution,</hi> may equally be applied to <hi>imaginary ſketches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your intention in taking <hi>views from nature,</hi> may either be to <hi>fix them in your own memory</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0566001100:75"/>
—or to <hi>convey, in ſome degree, your ideas to others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With regard to the former, when you meet a ſcene you wiſh to ſketch, your firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is to get it in the beſt point of view. A few paces to the right, or left, make a great difference. The ground, which folds awkwardly here, appears to fold more eaſily there: and that long blank curtain of the caſtle, which is ſo unpleaſing a circumſtance, as you ſtand on one ſide, is agreeably broken by a buttreſs on another.</p>
                  <p>Having thus fixed your point of view, your next conſideration, is, how to reduce it properly within the compaſs of your paper: for the ſcale of <hi>nature</hi> being ſo very different from <hi>your</hi> ſcale, it is a matter of difficulty, without ſome experience, to make them coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide. If the landſcape before you is extenſive, take care you do not include too much: it may perhaps be divided more commodiouſly into two ſketches.—When you have fixed the portion of it, you mean to take, fix next on two or three principal points, which you may juſt mark on your paper. This will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you the more eaſily to aſcertain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative ſituation of the ſeveral objects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0566001100:76"/>In ſketching, black-lead is the firſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commonly uſed. Nothing glides ſo volubly over paper, and executes an idea ſo quickly.—It has beſides, another advantage; it's grey tint correſponds better with a waſh, than black, or red chalk, or any other paſtile. —It admits alſo of eaſy correction.</p>
                  <p>The virtue of theſe haſty, black-lead ſketches conſiſts in catching readily the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic features</hi> of a ſcene. Light and ſhade are not attended to. It is enough if you expreſs <hi>general ſhapes;</hi> and the relations, which the ſeveral interſections of a country bear to each other. A few lines drawn on the ſpot, will do this. "Half a word, ſays Mr. Gray, fixed on, or near the ſpot, is worth all our recollected ideas. When we truſt to the picture, that objects draw of themſelves on the mind, we deceive ourſelves. Without accurate, and particular obſervation, it is but ill-drawn at firſt: the outlines are ſoon blur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: the colours, every day grow fainter; and at laſt, when we would produce it to any body, we are obliged to ſupply it's defects
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0566001100:77"/>
with a few ſtrokes of our own imagination."<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter to Mr. Palgrave, p. 272, 4to.</note>— What Mr. Gray ſays, relates chiefly to <hi>verbal</hi> deſcription: but in <hi>lineal</hi> deſcription it is equally true. The leading ideas muſt be fixed on the ſpot: if left to the memory, they ſoon evaporate.</p>
                  <p>The lines of black-lead, and indeed of any <hi>one</hi> inſtrument, are ſubject to the great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of <hi>confounding diſtances.</hi> If there are two, or three diſtances in the landſcape, as each of them is expreſſed by the <hi>ſame kind</hi> of line, the eye forgets the diſtinction, even in half a day's travelling; and all is confuſion. To remedy this, a few written references, made on the ſpot, are neceſſary, if the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape be at all complicated. The traveller ſhould be accurate in this point, as the ſpirit of his view depends much on the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of diſtances.—At his firſt leiſure however he will review his ſketch; add a few ſtrokes with a pen, to mark the near grounds; and by a ſlight waſh of Indian ink, throw in a few general lights, and ſhades, to keep all fixed, and in it's place.—A ſketch
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0566001100:78"/>
need not be carried farther, when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended merely to <hi>aſſiſt our own memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when a ſketch is intended <hi>to convey, in ſome degree, our ideas to others,</hi> it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that it ſhould be ſomewhat more adorned. To <hi>us</hi> the ſcene, familiar to our recollection, may be ſuggeſted by a few rough ſtrokes: but if you wiſh to raiſe the idea, <hi>where none exiſted before,</hi> and to do it <hi>agreeably,</hi> there ſhould be ſome <hi>compoſition</hi> in your ſketch—a degree of <hi>correctneſs, and expreſſion</hi> in the out-line— and ſome <hi>effect of light.</hi> A little <hi>ornament</hi> alſo from figures, and other circumſtances may be introduced. In ſhort, it ſhould be ſo far dreſſed, as to give ſome idea of a picture. I call this an <hi>adorned ſketch;</hi> and ſhould ſketch nothing, that was not <hi>capable</hi> of being thus dreſſed. An unpictureſque aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage of objects; and, in general, all untractable ſubjects, if it be neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them, may be given as plans, rather than as pictures.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, I ſhould adviſe the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller by no means to work his <hi>adorned ſketch</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0566001100:79"/>
upon his <hi>original one.</hi> His firſt ſketch is the ſtandard, to which, in the abſence of nature, he muſt at leaſt recur for his <hi>general ideas.</hi> By going over it again, the original ideas may be loſt, and the whole thrown into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Great maſters therefore always ſet a high value on their ſketches from nature. On the ſame principle the pictureſque tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller preſerves his original ſketch, tho in itſelf of little value, to keep him within proper bounds.</p>
                  <p>This matter being ſettled, and the <hi>adorned ſketch</hi> begun anew, the firſt point is to fix the <hi>compoſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>compoſition,</hi> you ſay, is already fixed by the <hi>original ſketch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true: but ſtill it may admit many little alterations, by which the forms of objects may be aſſiſted; and yet the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance not disfigured: as the ſame piece of muſic, performed by different maſters, and graced variouſly by each, may yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill the ſame. We muſt ever recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that nature is moſt defective in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and <hi>muſt</hi> be a little aſſiſted. Her ideas are too vaſt for pictureſque uſe, without the reſtraint of rules. Liberties however with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0566001100:80"/>
truth muſt be taken with caution: tho at the ſame time a diſtinction may be made between an <hi>object,</hi> and a <hi>ſcene.</hi> If I give the ſtriking features of the <hi>caſtle,</hi> or <hi>abbey,</hi> which is my <hi>object,</hi> I may be allowed ſome little liberty in bringing appendages (which are not eſſential features) within the rules of my art. But in a <hi>ſcene,</hi> the whole view becomes the portrait; and if I flatter here, I muſt flatter with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy.</p>
                  <p>But whether I repreſent an <hi>object,</hi> or a <hi>ſcene,</hi> I hold myſelf at perfect liberty, in the firſt place, to diſpoſe the <hi>foreground</hi> as I pleaſe; reſtrained only by the analogy of the country. I take up a tree here, and plant it there. I pare a knoll, or make an addition to it. I remove a piece of paling—a cottage—a wall— or any removeable object, which I diſlike. In ſhort, I do not ſo much mean to exact a liberty of introducing what does not exiſt; as of making a few of thoſe ſimple variations, of which all ground is eaſily ſuſceptible, and which time itſelf indeed is continually making. All this my art exacts:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>She rules the foreground; ſhe can ſwell, or ſink</l>
                     <l>It's ſurface; here her leafy ſkreen oppoſe,</l>
                     <l>And there withdraw; here part the varying greens,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0566001100:81"/>And croud them there in one promiſcuous gloom,</l>
                     <l>As beſt befits the genius of the ſcene.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The foreground indeed is a mere ſpot, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the extenſion of the diſtance: in itſelf it is of trivial conſequence; and cannot well be called a <hi>feature of the ſcene.</hi> And yet, tho ſo little eſſential in <hi>giving a likeneſs,</hi> it is more ſo than any other part in <hi>forming a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</hi> It reſembles thoſe deep tones in muſic, which give a value to all the lighter parts; and harmonize the whole.</p>
                  <p>As the foreground therefore is of ſo much conſequence, <hi>begin</hi> your <hi>adorned ſketch</hi> with fixing this very material part. It is eaſier to aſcertain the ſituation of your foreground, as it lies ſo near the bottom of your paper, than any other part; and this will tend to regulate every thing elſe. In your rough ſketch it has probably been inaccurately thrown in. You could not ſo eaſily aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, till you had gotten all your landſcape together. You might have carried it too high on your paper; or have brought it too low. As you have now the general ſcheme of your landſcape before you, you may adjuſt it properly; and give it it's due proportion. —I ſhall add only, on the ſubject of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0566001100:82"/>
that you need not be very nice in finiſhing them, even when you mean to <hi>adorn</hi> your ſketches. In a finiſhed picture the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground is a matter of great nicety: but in a ſketch little more is neceſſary, than to produce the effect you deſire.</p>
                  <p>Having fixed your foreground, you conſider in the ſame way, tho with more caution, the other parts of your <hi>compoſition.</hi> In a <hi>haſty tranſcript</hi> from nature, it is ſufficient to take the lines of the country juſt as you find them: but in your <hi>adorned ſketch</hi> you muſt grace them a little, where they run falſe. You muſt contrive to hide offenſive parts with wood; to cover ſuch as are too bald, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſhes; and to remove little objects, which in nature puſh themſelves too much in ſight, and ſerve only to introduce too many parts into your <hi>compoſition.</hi> In this happy adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the grand merit of your ſketch conſiſts. No beauty of light, colouring, or execution can atone for the want of <hi>compoſition.</hi> It is the foundation of all pictureſque beauty. No finery of dreſs can ſet off a perſon, whoſe figure is awkward, and uncouth.</p>
                  <p>Having thus <hi>digeſted the compoſition</hi> of your <hi>adorned ſketch,</hi> which is done with black-lead,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0566001100:83"/>
you proceed to give a ſtronger outline to the foreground, and nearer parts. Some indeed uſe no outline, but what they freely work with a bruſh on their black-lead ſketch. This comes neareſt the idea of painting; and as it is the moſt free, it is perhaps alſo the moſt excellent method: but as a black-lead outline is but a feeble termination, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a greater force in the waſh to produce an effect; and of courſe more the hand of a maſter. The hand of a maſter indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an effect with the rudeſt materials: but theſe precepts aim only at giving a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the tyroes of the art; and ſuch will perhaps make their out-line the moſt effectually with a pen. As the pen is more determined than black-lead, it leaves leſs to the bruſh, which I think the more difficult inſtrument.—Indian ink, (which may be heightened, or lowered to any degree of ſtrength, or weakneſs, ſo as to touch both the nearer, and more diſtant grounds,) is the beſt ink you can uſe. You may give a ſtroke with it ſo light as to confine even a remote diſtance; tho ſuch a diſtance is perhaps beſt left in black-lead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0566001100:84"/>But when we ſpeak of an <hi>out-line,</hi> we do not mean a <hi>ſimple contour;</hi> which, (however neceſſary in a correct figure,) would in land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape be formal. It is enough to mark with a few free touches of the pen, here and there, ſome of the breaks, and roughneſſes, in which the richneſs of an object conſiſts. But you muſt firſt determine the ſituation of your lights, that you may mark theſe touches on the ſhadowy ſide.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe free touches with a pen the chief characteriſtic is <hi>expreſſion;</hi> or the art of giving each object, that peculiar touch, whether ſmooth, or rough, which beſt expreſſes it's form. The art of painting, in it's higheſt perfection, cannot give the richneſs of nature. When we examine any natural form, we find the multiplicity of it's parts beyond the higheſt finiſhing: and indeed generally an attempt at the higheſt finiſhing would end in ſtiffneſs. The painter is obliged therefore to deceive the eye by ſome natural tint, or expreſſive touch, from which the imagination takes it's cue. How often do we ſee in the landſcapes of Claude the full effect of diſtance; which, when examined cloſely, conſiſts of a ſimple daſh, tinged with the hue of nature,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0566001100:85"/>
intermixed with a few expreſſive touches?— If then theſe expreſſive touches are neceſſary, where the maſter carries on the deception both in form, and colour; how neceſſary muſt they be in mere ſketches, in which colour, the great vehicle of deception, is removed?—The art however of giving thoſe expreſſive marks with a pen, which impreſs ideas, is no common one. The inferior artiſt may give them by chance: but the maſter only gives them with preciſion.—Yet a ſketch may have it's uſe, and even it's merit, without theſe ſtrokes of genius.</p>
                  <p>As the difficulty of uſing the pen is ſuch, it may perhaps be objected, that it is an improper inſtrument for a tyro. It loſes it's grace, if it have not a ready, and off-hand execution.</p>
                  <p>It is true: but what other inſtrument ſhall we put into his hands, that will do better? His black-lead, his bruſh, whatever he touches, will be unmaſterly. But my chief reaſon for putting a pen into his hands, is, that without a pen it will be difficult for him to preſerve his outline, and diſtances. His touches with a pen may be unmaſterly, we allow: but ſtill they will preſerve <hi>keeping</hi> in his landſcape,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0566001100:86"/>
without which the whole will be a blot of confuſion.—Nor is it perhaps ſo difficult to obtain ſome little freedom with a pen. I have ſeen aſſiduity, attended with but little genius, make a conſiderable progreſs in the uſe of this inſtrument; and produce an effect by no means diſpleaſing.—If the drawing be large, I ſhould recommend a reed-pen, which runs more freely over paper.</p>
                  <p>When the out-line is thus drawn, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to add light, and ſhade. In this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the effect of a <hi>waſh</hi> is much better, than of lines hatched with a pen. A bruſh will do more in one ſtroke, and generally more effectually, than a pen can do in twenty.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>I have ſeldom ſeen any drawings etched with a pen, that pleaſed me. The moſt maſterly ſketches in this way I ever ſaw, were taken in the early part of the life of a gentleman, now very high in his profeſſion, Mr. Mitford of Lincoln's inn. They were taken in ſeveral parts of Italy, and England; and tho they are mere memorandum-ſketches, the ſubjects are ſo happily choſen—they are ſo characteriſtic of the countries they repreſent—and executed with ſo free, and expreſſive a touch, that I examined them with pleaſure, not only as faithful por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits, (which I believe they all are) but as maſter-pieces, as far as they go, both in compoſition, and execution.</p>
                     </note> For this purpoſe, we need only
<pb facs="tcp:0566001100:87"/>
                     <figure/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:0566001100:88"/>

                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0566001100:89"/>
Indian ink; and perhaps a little biſtre, or burnt umber. With the former we give that greyiſh tinge, which belongs to the ſky, and diſtant objects; and with the latter (mixed more, or leſs with Indian ink) thoſe warm touches, which belong to the foreground. Indian ink however alone makes a good waſh both for the foreground, and diſtance.</p>
                  <p>But mere <hi>light and ſhade</hi> are not ſufficient: ſomething of <hi>effect</hi> alſo ſhould be aimed at in the <hi>adorned ſketch.</hi> Mere light and ſhade propoſe only the <hi>ſimple illumination</hi> of objects. <hi>Effect,</hi> by balancing <hi>large maſſes</hi> of each, gives the whole a greater force.—Now tho in the exhibitions of nature, we commonly find only the <hi>ſimple illumination</hi> of objects; yet as we often do meet with <hi>grand effects</hi> alſo, we have ſufficient authority to uſe them: for under theſe circumſtances we ſee nature in her beſt attire, in which it is our buſineſs to deſcribe her.</p>
                  <p>As to giving rules for the production of effect, the ſubject admits only the <hi>moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> There muſt be a ſtrong oppoſition of light and ſhade; in which the ſky, as well as the landſcape, muſt combine. But in what
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0566001100:90"/>
way this oppoſition muſt be varied—where the full tone of ſhade muſt prevail—where the full effuſion of light—or where the various degrees of each—depends intirely on the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the <hi>compoſition.</hi> All you can do, is to examine your drawing (yet in it's naked out-line) with care; and endeavour to find out where the force of the light will have the beſt effect. But this depends more on <hi>taſte,</hi> than on <hi>rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One thing both in light and ſhade ſhould be obſerved, eſpecially in the former—and that is <hi>gradation;</hi> which gives a force beyond what a glaring diſplay of light can give. The effect of light, which falls on the ſtone, produced as an illuſtration of this idea, would not be ſo great, unleſs it <hi>graduated</hi> into ſhade. —In the following ſtanza Mr. Gray has with great beauty, and propriety, illuſtrated the viciſſitudes of life by the principles of pictureſque effect.</p>

                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0566001100:92"/>I may farther add, that the production of an <hi>effect</hi> is particularly neceſſary in <hi>drawing.</hi> In <hi>painting,</hi> colour in ſome degree makes up the deficency: but in ſimple clair-obſcure there is no ſuccedaneum. It's force depends on effect; the virtue of which is ſuch, that it will give a value even to a barren ſubject. Like ſtriking the chords of a muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will produce harmony, without any richneſs of compoſition.</p>
                  <p>It is farther to be obſerved, that when objects <hi>are in ſhadow,</hi> the light, (as it is then a reflected one,) falls on the oppoſite ſide to that, on which it falls, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>adorning your ſketch,</hi> a figure, or two may be introduced with propriety. By figures I mean moving objects, as waggons, and boats, as well as cattle, and men. But they ſhould be introduced ſparingly. In profuſion they are affected. Their chief uſe is, to mark a road—to break a piece of foreground—to point out the horizon in a ſea-view—or to carry off the diſtance of retiring water by the contraſt of a dark ſail, not quite ſo diſtant, placed before it. But in figures thus deſigned for the ornament of a ſketch, a few ſlight
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0566001100:93"/>
touches are ſufficient. Attempts at finiſhing offend.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the preceding eſſay.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among trees, little diſtinction need be made, unleſs you introduce the pine, or the cypreſs, or ſome other ſingular form. The oak, the aſh, and the elm, which bear a diſtant reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to each other, may all be characterized alike. In a ſketch, it is enough to mark <hi>a tree.</hi> One diſtinction indeed is often neceſſary even in ſketches; and that is, between full-leaved trees, and thoſe of ſtraggling ramification. In compoſition we have often occaſion for both, and therefore the hand ſhould be uſed readily to execute either. If we have a general idea of the oak, for inſtance, as a light tree; and of the beech as a heavy one, it is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>It adds, I think, to the beauty of a ſketch to ſtain the paper ſlightly with a reddiſh, or yellowiſh tinge; the uſe of which is to give a more pleaſing tint to the ground of the drawing by taking away the glare of the paper. It adds alſo, if it be not too ſtrong, a degree of harmony to the rawneſs of black, and white.
<pb facs="tcp:0566001100:94"/>
                     <figure/>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0566001100:95"/>
This tinge may be laid on, either before, or after the drawing is made. In general, I ſhould prefer the latter method; becauſe, while the drawing is yet on white paper, you may correct it with a ſponge, dipt in water; which will, in a good degree, efface Indian ink. But if you rub out any part, <hi>after</hi> the drawing is ſtained, you cannot eaſily lay the ſtain again upon the rubbed part without the appearance of a patch.</p>
                  <p>Some chuſe rather to add a little colour to their ſketches. My inſtructions attempt not the art of mixing a variety of tints; and finiſhing a drawing from nature; which is generally executed in colours from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, without any uſe of Indian ink; except as a grey tint, uniting with other colours. This indeed, when chaſtly executed, (which is not often the caſe) exceeds in beauty every other ſpecies of drawing. It is however be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my ſkill to give any inſtruction for this mode of drawing. All I mean, is only to offer a modeſt way of tinting a ſketch already finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Indian ink. By the addition of a little colour I mean only to give ſome diſtinction
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0566001100:96"/>
to objects; and introduce rather a gayer ſtile into a landſcape.</p>
                  <p>When you have finiſhed your ſketch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with Indian ink, as far as you propoſe, tinge the whole over with ſome light horizon hue. It may be the roſy tint of morning; or the more ruddy one of evening; or it may incline more to a yellowiſh, or a greyiſh caſt. As a ſpecimen an evening hue is given. The firſt tint you ſpread over your drawing, is compoſed of light red, and oker, which make an orange. It may incline to one, or the other, as you chuſe. In this example it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines rather to the former. By waſhing this tint over your <hi>whole drawing,</hi> you lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for harmony. When this waſh is nearly dry, repeat it in the horizon; ſoftening it off into the ſky, as you aſcend.—Take next a purple tint, compoſed of lake, and blue, inclining rather to the former; and with this, when your firſt waſh is dry, form your clouds; and then ſpread it, as you did the firſt tint, over your <hi>whole drawing,</hi> except where you leave the horizon-tint. This ſtill ſtrengthens the idea of harmony. Your ſky, and diſtance are now finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0566001100:97"/>You proceed next to your <hi>middle,</hi> and <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds;</hi> in both which you diſtinguiſh between the <hi>ſoil,</hi> and the vegetation. Waſh the <hi>middle grounds</hi> with a little umber. This will be ſufficient for the <hi>ſoil.</hi> The <hi>ſoil</hi> of the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground</hi> you may go over with a little light red. The <hi>vegetation</hi> of each may be waſhed with a green, compoſed of blue, and oker; adding a little more oker as you proceed nearer the eye; and on the neareſt grounds a little burnt terra Sienna. This is ſufficient for the <hi>middle grounds.</hi> The <hi>foreground</hi> may farther want a little heightening both in the <hi>ſoil,</hi> and <hi>vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In the <hi>ſoil</hi> it may be given in the lights with burnt terra Sienna; mixing in the ſhadows a little lake: and in the <hi>vegetation</hi> with gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; touched in places, and occaſionally varied, with a little burnt terra Sienna.</p>
                  <p>Trees on the foreground are conſidered as a part of it; and their foliage may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured like the vegetation in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. Their ſtems may be touched with burnt terra Sienna.—Trees, in middle diſtances are darker than the lawns, on which they ſtand. They muſt therefore be touched twice over with the tint, which is given only once to the lawn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0566001100:98"/>If you repreſent clouds with bright edges, the edges muſt be left in the firſt orange; while the tint over the other part of the horizon is repeated, as was mentioned before.</p>
                  <p>A lowering, cloudy ſky is repreſented by, what is called, a grey tint, compoſed of lake, blue, and oker. As the ſhadow deepens, the tint ſhould incline more to blue.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral tints mentioned in the above proceſs, may perhaps the moſt eaſily be mixed before you begin; eſpecially if your drawing be large. Rub the raw colours in little ſaucers: keep them clean, and diſtinct; and from them, mix your tints in other little veſſels.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add, that the <hi>ſtrength of the colouring</hi> you give your ſketch, muſt depend on the height, to which you have carried the Indian ink <hi>finiſhing.</hi> If it be only a ſlight ſketch, it will bear only a light waſh of colour.</p>
                  <p>This mode however of tinting a drawing, even when you tint it as high as theſe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reach, is by no means calculated to produce any great effect of colouring: but it is at leaſt ſufficient to preſerve harmony. <hi>This</hi> you may preſerve: an <hi>effect of colouring</hi> you cannot eaſily attain. It is ſomething how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0566001100:99"/>
to avoid a diſagreeable exceſs; and there is nothing ſurely ſo diſagreeable to a correct eye as a tinted drawing (ſuch as we often ſee) in which greens, and blues, and reds, and yellows are daubed without any attention to harmony. It is to the pictureſque eye, what a diſcord of harſh notes is to a muſical ear.</p>
                  <p>But the advocate for theſe glaring tints may perhaps ſay, he does not make his ſky more blue than nature; nor his graſs, and trees more green.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſo: but unleſs he could work up his drawing with the finiſhing of nature, he will find the effect very unequal. Nature mixes a variety of ſemitints with her brighteſt colours: and tho the eye cannot readily ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them, they have a general chaſtizing effect; and keep the ſeveral tints of landſcape within proper bounds, which a glare of deep colours cannot do. Beſides, this chaſtizing hue is produced in nature by numberleſs little ſhadows, beyond the attention of art, which ſhe throws on leaves, and piles of graſs, and every other minute object; all which, tho not eaſily diſtinguiſhed in <hi>particulars,</hi> tells <hi>in the whole,</hi> and is continually chaſtening the hues of nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0566001100:100"/>Before I conclude theſe remarks on ſketch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it may be uſeful to add a few words, and but a few, on perſpective. The nicer parts of it contain many difficulties; and are of little uſe in common landſcape: but as a building, now and then, occurs, which requires ſome little knowledge of perſpective, the ſubject ſhould not be left wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched.</p>
                  <p>If a building ſtand exactly in front, none of it's lines can go off in perſpective: but if it ſtand with a corner to the eye, as pictureſque buildings commonly do, it's lines will appear to recede. In what manner they recede, the following mechanical method may explain.</p>
                  <p>Hold horizontally between your eye, and the building you draw, a flat ruler, till you ſee only the edge of it. Where it cuts the <hi>neareſt perpendicular</hi> of the building, which you have already juſt traced on your paper, make a <hi>mark;</hi> and draw a ſlight line through that part, parallel with the bottom of your paper. This is called the <hi>horizontal line,</hi> and regulates the whole perſpective. Obſerve next the angle, which the uppermoſt of theſe reced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:0566001100:101"/>
                     <figure/>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0566001100:102"/>
lines makes with the <hi>neareſt perpendicular</hi> of the building; and continue that receding line till it meet the <hi>horizontal line.</hi> From the point, where it interſects, draw another line to the bottom of the <hi>neareſt perpendicular.</hi> This gives you the perſpective of the baſe. In the ſame manner all the lines, which recede, on both ſides, of the building; as well above, as below the <hi>horizontal line</hi>—windows, doors, and projections of every kind, (on the ſame plane)—are regulated. The points on the <hi>horizontal line,</hi> in which theſe receding lines unite, are called <hi>points of ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all, however, from the mode of ſketching here recommended (which is as far as I ſhould wiſh to recommend drawing landſcape to thoſe, who draw only for amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) no great degree of accuracy can be expected. General ideas only muſt be looked for; not the peculiarities of portrait. It admits the winding river—the ſhooting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory —the caſtle—the abbey—the flat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance —and the mountain melting into the horizon. It admits too the relation, which all theſe parts bear to each other. But it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0566001100:103"/>
deſcends not to the minutiae of objects. The fringed bank of the river—the Gothic ornaments of the abbey—the chaſms, and frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the rock, and caſtle—and every little object along the vale, it pretends not to delineate with exactneſs. All this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the finiſhed drawing, and the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in which the artiſt conveys an idea of each minute feature of the country he <hi>delineates,</hi> or <hi>imagines.</hi> But <hi>high finiſhing,</hi> as I have before obſerved, belongs only to a maſter, who can give <hi>expreſſive touches.</hi> The diſciple, whom I am inſtructing, and whom I inſtruct only from my own experience, muſt have humbler views; and can hardly expect to pleaſe, if he go farther than a ſketch, <hi>adorned</hi> as hath been here deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Many gentlemen, who draw for amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, employ their leiſure on human figures, animal life, portrait, perhaps hiſtory. Here and there a man of genius makes ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in theſe difficult branches of the art: but I have rarely ſeen any, who do. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted faces, and diſlocated limbs, I have ſeen in abundance: and no wonder; for the ſcience of anatomy, <hi>even</hi> as it regards painting, is with difficulty attained; and few who have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0566001100:104"/>
ſtudied it their whole lives, have acquired perfection.</p>
                  <p>Others again, who draw for amuſement, go ſo far as to handle the pallet. But in this the ſucceſs of the ill-judging artiſt ſeldom anſwers his hopes; unleſs utterly void of taſte, he happen to be ſuch an artiſt as may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed in the ſarcaſm of the critic, <q>—Sine rivali teque, et tua ſolus amares.</q>
Painting is both a ſcience, and an art; and if ſo very few attain perfection, who ſpend a life-time on it, what can be expected from thoſe, who ſpend only their leiſure? The very few gentlemen-artiſts, who excel in <hi>paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſcarce afford encouragement for common practice.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>art of ſketching landſcape</hi> is attainable by a man of buſineſs; and it is certainly more uſeful; and, I ſhould imagine, more amuſing, to attain <hi>ſome degree</hi> of excellence in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior branch, than to be a mere bungler in a ſuperior. Even if you ſhould not excel in <hi>execution</hi> (which indeed you can hardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect) you may at leaſt by bringing home the delineation of a fine country, dignify an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0566001100:105"/>
s;ketch. You may pleaſe yourſelf by adminiſtring ſtrongly to recollection: and you may pleaſe others by conveying your ideas more diſtinctly in an ordinary ſketch, than in the beſt language.</p>

                     <item>Line 107 On a ſuppoſition, that the artiſt is enamoured with his ſubject; and is well verſed in copying the parts of nature, he begins
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0566001100:107"/>
to combine, and form thoſe parts into the ſubjects of landſcape. He pays his firſt attention to <hi>deſign,</hi> or to the bringing together of ſuch objects, as are ſuited to his ſubject; not mixing trivial objects with grand ſcenes; but preſerving the <hi>character</hi> of his ſubject, whatever it may be.</item>
                     <item>Line 133 The different parts of his landſcape muſt next be ſtudiouſly arranged, and put together in a pictureſque manner. This is the work of <hi>diſpoſition;</hi> or, as it is ſometimes called, <hi>compoſition.</hi> No rules can be given for this arrangement, but the experience of a nice eye: for tho nature ſeldom preſents a compleat compoſition, yet we every where ſee in her works beautiful arrangements of parts; which we ought to ſtudy with great attention.</item>
                     <item>Line 149 In general, a landſcape is compoſed of three parts—a foreground—a middle ground— and a diſtance.</item>
                     <item>Line 153 Yet this is not a univerſal rule. A <hi>balance of parts</hi> however there ſhould always be; tho ſometimes thoſe parts may be few.</item>
                     <item>Line 166 It is a great error in landſcape-painters, to loſe the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of a whole, under the idea of giving <hi>variety.</hi>

                     <item>Line 195 In balancing a landſcape, a ſpacious fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground will admit a ſmall thread of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but the reverſe is a bad propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In every landſcape there <hi>muſt</hi> be a conſiderable foreground.</item>
                     <item>Line 206 This theory is illuſtrated by the view of a <hi>diſproportioned diſtance.</hi>

                     <item>Line 233 An objection anſwered, why vaſt diſtances, tho unſupported by foregrounds, may pleaſe <hi>in nature,</hi> and yet offend <hi>in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Line 256 But tho the ſeveral parts of landſcape may be <hi>well ballanced,</hi> and adjuſted; yet ſtill without <hi>contraſt in the parts,</hi> there will be a great deficiency. At the ſame time this contraſt muſt be eaſy, and natural.</item>
                     <item>Line 276 Such pictures, as are painted from fancy, are the moſt pleaſing efforts of genius. But if an untoward ſubject be given, the artiſt, muſt endeavour to conceal, and vary the unaccommodating parts. The foreground he <hi>muſt</hi> claim as his own.</item>
                     <item>Line 298 But if nature be the ſource of all beauty, it may be objected, that imaginary views can have little merit. The objection has weight, if the imaginary view be not
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0566001100:109"/>
formed from the ſelected parts of nature; but if it be, it is nature ſtill.</item>
                     <item>Line 312 The artiſt having thus adjuſted his forms, and diſpoſition; conceives next the beſt effect of light; and when he has thus laid the foundation of his picture, proceeds to colouring.</item>
                     <item>Line 325 The author avoids giving rules for colouring, which are learned chiefly by practice.</item>
                     <item>Line 331 He juſt touches on the theory of colours.</item>
                     <item>Line 352 Artiſts, with equally good effect, ſometimes blend them on their pallet; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpread them raw on their canvas.</item>
                     <item>Line 362 In colouring, the ſky gives the ruling tint to the landſcape: and the hue of the whole, whether rich, or ſober, muſt be harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious.</item>

Beneath the frothy curl, when it riſes between the eye, and the light, the colour is pale green, which brightens from the baſe towards the ſummit. When a wave ſubſides, the ſummit falling into the baſe, extends, and raiſes it; and the ſides running off from the centre, that part of the water which meets the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wave, ſprings upward from the ſhock; the top forms into foam, and rolling over falls down the ſide, which has been ſhocked; preſenting if the water be much agitated, the idea of a caſcade.</item>

Some writers on the art of painting have varied this diviſion. But it ſeems moſt proper, I think, to give the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the elements of landſcape— the aſſembling of rocks, mountains, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts, and other objects to <hi>deſign:</hi> while <hi>diſpoſition</hi> is properly employed in the local arrangement of them.</item>
                     <item>Line 149 The <hi>general</hi> compoſition of a landſcape con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of three parts—the foreground—the ſecond ground—and the diſtance. No rule can be given for proportioning theſe parts to each other. There are ten thouſand beautiful proportions; from which the eye of taſte muſt ſelect a good one. The foreground muſt always be conſiderable—in ſome caſes, ample. It is the very baſis, and foundation of the whole.—Nor is it a bad rule, I think, that ſome part of the foreground ſhould be the higheſt part of the picture. In rocky, and mountainous views this is eaſy, and has generally a good effect. And ſometimes even when a country is more level, a tree on the foreground, carried higher than the reſt of the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, anſwers the end. At the ſame time in many ſpecies of landſcape this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0566001100:138"/>
rule cannot eaſily be adapted: nor is it by any means eſſential.</item>
                     <item>Line 164 <hi>Waterlo, like thine.</hi> The ſubjects of this maſter ſeldom went beyond ſome little foreſt-view. He has etched a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of prints in this ſtile of landſcape; which for the beauty of the trees in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, are much admired.</item>
                     <item>Line 173 <hi>Landſcapes, that knew no leading ſubject.</hi> There is not a rule in landſcape-painting more neglected; or that ought more to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, than what relates to a <hi>leading-ſubject.</hi> By the leading ſubject, we mean, what <hi>characterizes the ſcene.</hi> We often ſee a landſcape, which comes under no denomination. Is it the ſcenery about a ruin? Is it a lake-ſcene? Is it a river-ſcene? No: but it is a jumble of all together. Some leading ſubject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is required in every landſcape, which forms it's character; and to which the painter
<q>
                           <l>— is confined by rules,</l>
                           <l>As fixed, and rigid as the tragic bard.</l>
                        </q>
when the landſcape takes it's character from a ruin, or other object on the foreground, the <hi>diſtance</hi> introduced, is merely an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage; and muſt plainly appear to be an under-part; not interfering with the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0566001100:139"/>
ſubject of the piece. But moſt commonly the ſcene, or leading-ſubject of the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, occupies the middle diſtance. In this caſe, the <hi>foreground</hi> becomes the appendage; and without any ſtriking object to attract the eye, muſt plainly ſhew, that it is intended only to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the leading-ſubject with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</item>
                     <item>Line 190 Thus, in a foreſt-ſcene, the woods and lawns are the leading-ſubject. If the piece will admit it, a hill, or a lake, may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>remote diſtance:</hi> but they muſt be introduced, only as the epiſodes in a poem, to ſet off the main ſubject. They muſt not interfere with it; but be <hi>far removed.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Line 197 <hi>And tho a glance.</hi> It is certain, in fact, that a conſiderable foreground, with a glance of diſtance, will make a better picture, than a wide diſtance, ſet off only with a meagre foreground: and yet I doubt whether an adequate reaſon can be given; unleſs it be founded on what hath already been advanced, that we conſider the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground as the <hi>baſis, and foundation of the whole picture.</hi> So that if it is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in all circumſtances, and extenſive in ſome, there ſeems a defect.</item>

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0566001100:140"/>Line 280 <hi>A novel whole.</hi> The imaginary-view, formed on a judicious ſelection, and arrangement of the parts of nature, has a better chance of making a good picture, than a view taken in the whole from any natural ſcene. Not only the lines, and objects of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſcene rarely admit a happy compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the <hi>character</hi> of it is ſeldom throughout preſerved. Whether it be <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime,</hi> or <hi>beautiful,</hi> there is generally ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing mixed with it of a nature unſuitable to it. All this the exhibition of fancy rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies, when in the hands of a maſter. Nor does he claim any thing, but what the poet, and he are equally allowed. Where is the ſtory in real life, on which the poet can form either an epic, or a drama, unleſs heightened by his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? At the ſame time he muſt take care, that all his imaginary additions are founded in nature, or his work will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. Such alſo muſt be the painter's care. But under this reſtriction, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly may bring together a more <hi>conſiſtent whole,</hi> culled from the <hi>various parts</hi> of nature, than nature herſelf exhibits in <hi>any one ſcene.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0566001100:141"/>
We often admire theſe firſt, rude touches. The ſtory of the two old maſters will be remembred, who left cards of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to each other, on which only the ſimple outline of a figure was drawn by one, and corrected by the other; but with ſuch a ſuperior elegance in each, that the ſignature of names could not have marked them more deciſively.</item>
                     <item>Line 318 <hi>Firſt ſketch a ſlight cartoon.</hi> It is the practice indeed of the generality of painters, when they have any great deſign to execute, to make a ſlight ſketch, ſometimes on paper, and ſometimes on canvas. And theſe ſketches are often greatly ſuperior to the principal picture, which has been laboured, and finiſhed with the exacteſt care. King William on horſe-back at Hampton court, by ſir Godfrey Kneller, is a ſtriking example of this remark. The picture is highly finiſhed; but is a tame, and unmaſterly performance. At Houghton-hall I have ſeen the original ſketch of this picture; which I ſhould have valued, not only greatly beyond the picture itſelf, but beyond any thing I ever ſaw from the pencil of ſir Godfrey.</item>
                     <item>Line 331 <hi>One truth ſhe gives,</hi> &amp;c. From theſe three virgin colours, <hi>red, blue,</hi> and <hi>yellow,</hi> all the tints of nature are compoſed. Greens
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0566001100:142"/>
of various hues, are compoſed of blue, and yellow: orange, of red, and yellow: purple and violet, of red, and blue. The tints of the rainbow ſeem to be compoſed alſo of theſe colours. They lie in order thus: violet—<hi>red</hi>—orange—<hi>yellow</hi>—green —<hi>blue</hi>—violet—<hi>red:</hi> in which aſſortment we obſerve that orange comes between <hi>red,</hi> and <hi>yellow;</hi> that is, it is compoſed of thoſe colours melting into each other. Green is in the ſame way compoſed of <hi>yellow</hi> and <hi>blue;</hi> and violet, or purple of <hi>blue,</hi> and <hi>red.</hi>—Nay even browns of all kinds may, in a degree, be effected by a mixture of theſe original colours: ſo may grey; and even a kind of black, tho not a perfect one.—As all pigments how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are deficient, and cannot approach the rainbow colours, which are the pureſt we know, the painter muſt often, even in his ſplendid tints, call in different reds, blues, and yellows. Thus as vermilion, tho an excellent red on many occaſions, cannot give the roſy, crimſon hue, he muſt often call in lake. Nor will he find any yellow, or blue, that will anſwer every purpoſe. In the tribe of browns he will be ſtill more at a loſs; and muſt have recourſe to different earths.—In oil-painting one of the fineſt earths is known,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0566001100:143"/>
at the colour-ſhops, by the name of <hi>caſtle-earth,</hi> or <hi>Vandyke's-brown;</hi> as it is ſuppoſed to have been uſed by that maſter.</item>

A mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indeed of theſe three will produce nearly the colour you want: but the more colours are mixed, the muddier they grow.

It includes a perfect knowledge of the effects of colours in all their various agreements, and oppoſitions. When attained, it is the moſt eaſy in practice. The artiſt, who blends his colours on his pallet, depends more on his eye, than on his

knowledge. He works out his effect by a more laboured proceſs; and yet he may produce a good picture in the end.</item>

Not many years ago, an old Thames-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terman was alive, who remembred him well; and had often carried him out in his boat, both up and down the river, to ſtudy the appearances of the ſky. The old man uſed to ſay, they went out in all kinds of weather, fair, and foul; and Mr. Vanderveldt took with him large ſheets of blue paper, which he would mark all over with black, and white. The artiſt eaſily ſees the intention of this proceſs. Theſe expeditions Vanderveldt called, in his Dutch manner of ſpeaking, <hi>going a ſkoying.</hi>

I can eaſily conceive, that a <hi>balance</hi> of light and ſhade may be founded in ſome kind of reaſon; but am at a loſs to give a reaſon for a predominancy of either.

Rembrandt, I doubt, is ſometimes chargeable with this fault. He is commonly ſuppoſed to be a maſter of this part of painting; and we often ſee very beautiful lights in his pictures, and prints: but as in many of them we ſee the reverſe, he appears to have had no fixed principle. Indeed, few parts of painting are ſo much neglected, ſo eaſily tranſgreſſed, and ſo little underſtood, as the diſtribution of light.</item>

It is as much the reverſe, when white and black, or white, and red, are patched over the animal in blotches, without any intermediate tints. Domeſtic cattle, cows, dogs, ſwine, goats, and cats, are often diſagreeably patched: tho we ſometimes ſee them pleaſingly coloured with a graduating tint. Wild animals, in general, are more uniformly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0566001100:147"/>
coloured, than tame. Except the zebra, and two or three of the ſpotted race, I recollect none which are not, more or leſs, tinted in this graduating manner. The tiger, the panther, and other varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated animals have their beauty: but the zebra, I think, is rather a curious, than a pictureſque animal. It's ſtreaked ſides injure it both in point of colour, and in the delineation of it's form.</item>

This however is only a general rule. In hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-painting the light is properly thrown upon the figures on the foreground; which are the <hi>capital part</hi> of the picture. In landſcape the middle grounds commonly form <hi>the ſcene,</hi> or the <hi>capital part;</hi> and the foreground is litttle more, than an appendage.

Through a paſſage in the mountain we ſee the troops winding round at a great diſtance. Among thoſe nearer the eye, we diſtinguiſh the horſe and foot; and on the foreground, the action, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the principal commanders. The ancients ſeem to have known very little of that ſource of the pictureſque, which ariſes from perſpective: every thing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in front before the eye: and among the early painters we ſee very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more attention paid to it. Raphael is far from making a full uſe of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; and I believe Julio Romano makes ſtill leſs. I do not remember meeting any where with a more pictureſque deſcription of a line of march, than in Vaillant's travels into the interior parts of Africa. He was paſſing with a numerous caravan, along the borders of Caffraria. I firſt, ſays he, made the people of the hord, which accompanied me, ſet out with their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: and a little after my cattle followed; cows, ſheep, and goats; with all the women of the hord, mounted on oxen with their children. My waggons, with the reſt of my people, cloſed the rear. I myſelf, mounted on horſeback, rode backwards, and forewards. This caravan
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0566001100:151"/>
on it's march, exhibited often a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and amuſing ſpectacle. The turns it was obliged to make in following the windings of the woods, and rocks, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually gave it new forms. Sometimes it intirely diſappeared: then ſuddenly, at a diſtance, from the ſummit of a hill, I again diſcovered my vanguard ſlowly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing perhaps towards a diſtant moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: while the main body, following the track, were juſt below me.</item>
                     <item>Line 595 This rule indeed applies to all other objects: but as the ſhip is ſo large a machine, and at the ſame time ſo complicated a one, it's <hi>character</hi> is leſs obvious, than that of moſt other objects. It is much better therefore, where a veſſel is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to put in a few touches for a ſkiff; than to inſert ſome diſagreeable form for a ſhip, to which it has no Reſemblance.

We ſhould be careful not to narrow too much the circumſcribed ſphere of art. There is an art of ſeeing, as well as of painting. The eye muſt in part enter into the deception. The art of painting muſt, in ſome degree, be conſidered as an act of convention. General forms only are imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and much is to be ſupplied by the imagination of the ſpectator.—It is thus in drama. How abſurdly would the ſpectator act, if inſtead of aſſiſting the illuſion of the ſtage, he ſhould inſiſt on being deceived, without being a party in the deception?—if he refuſed to believe, that the light he ſaw, was the ſun; or the ſcene before him, the Roman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, becauſe he knew the one was a candle-light, and the other, a painted cloth?

Till they can be prevailed on to return upon their ſteps, and look for that criterion in nature, which they ſeek in the half-periſhed works of great names; the painter will be diſcouraged from purſuing knowledge in thoſe paths, where Raphael, and Titian found it.</item>
                     <item>Line 639 <hi>What if theſe compare,</hi> &amp;c. Bruyere obſerves, that the inferior critic judges only by <hi>compariſon.</hi> In one ſenſe all judgment muſt be formed on compariſon. But Bruyere, who is ſpeaking of poetry means, that the inferior critic has no ſcale of judging of a work of art, but by comparing it with ſome other work of the ſame kind. He judges of Virgil by a compariſon with Homer; and of Spencer by comparing him with Taſſo. By ſuch criticiſm he may indeed arrive at certain truths; but he will never form that maſterly judgment, which he might do by comparing the work before him
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0566001100:154"/>
with the great archetypes of nature, and the ſolid rules of his art.—What Bruyere ſays of the critic in poetry, is very applicable to the critic in painting. The inferior critic, who has travelled, and ſeen the works of many great maſters, ſuppoſes he has treaſured up from them the ideas of perfection; and inſtead of judging of a picture by the rules of painting, and it's agreement with nature, he judges of it by the arbitrary ideas he has conceived; and theſe too very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably much injured in the conception. From this comparative mode of criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cizing, the art receives no advancement. All we gain, is, that one artiſt paints better than another.</item>
