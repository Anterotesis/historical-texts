            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>SIR Arthur arrived in town this morning. He brought the uſurer Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley up with him in the ſame carriage.</p>
               <p>Young St. Ives ſet out before them, and was in London laſt night. He
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0201200107:3"/>
drove directly to my lodgings, and I was fortunately at home. This did not look as if I were in the ſecret; and if he had any ſuſpicions he had not the courage to intimate them.</p>
               <p>I condoled with him, ſaid it was a ſtrange affair, a riddle I could not read, a myſtery which time muſt elucidate, for it baffled all conjecture. He did little more than echo me, and I pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I would have ridden half over the world to recover his ſiſter, had there been but the leaſt clue; but there was not, and I found myſelf obliged to ſit ſtill in deſpair and aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>He ſaid it was all very true, and he was very tired. He ſhould therefore drive home, get ſome refreſhment, and go to bed. This fellow, Fairfax, walks
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0201200107:4"/>
on two legs, looks the world in the face, and counts for one on the muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll. <q>But nature, creſcent in him, grew only in thews and bulk.</q> Yet on the parade, fools and gapers will miſtake him for a man.</p>
               <p>Contention with Anna St. Ives is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, but to ſeem to ſhrink from beings like theſe, or to practiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment with ſuch mere images of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, is repugnant to the generous ſcorn they merit and inſpire. Imperious ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity however preſcribes law, and I took care to prevent Sir Arthur's viſit to me, by having notice ſent me of his arrival, and immediately going to the encounter.</p>
               <p>To anticipate is to overturn the card<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtles of this puny race. Come upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0201200107:5"/>
them unexpectedly, ſtare at them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly, and interrogate them abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they are put to the rout. Their looks even intreat pardon for the ill they thought, but durſt not utter.</p>
               <p>Sir Arthur I own beheld me with a ſuſpicious eye; and though he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſeem to credit me, he did it with an aukward air.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clarke hearing I was there came in, and exceeding even all her former ſervour, importuned me, in the moſt direct and vehement manner, to tell what I had done with Mr. Henley and her dear young lady. She more than ever diſconcerted me. Her exuberant paſſion addreſſed itſelf alternately to me and her maſter. Her tears as well as her words were abundant, her urgency
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0201200107:6"/>
and ardour extreme, and ſhe ended her apoſtrophe with again conjuring me to tell what was become of her dear, dear young lady!</p>
               <p>"Ay, pray, pray do"—whimpered the baronet in a maudlin tone, moved by the unfeigned paſſion of his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper. I gave him a look, and the driveller added—"if you know."</p>
               <p>I was glad of a pretence to get away, and after telling him the diſtreſs of his mind was the only apology for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, I inſtantly quitted him, without any effort on his part to detain me.</p>
               <p>Among other things, Mrs. Clarke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly reproached herſelf for not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written or ſent to my ſiſter; and the knight acknowledged—<q>Ay, it was very neglectful! But his mind had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0201200107:7"/>
been ſo diſturbed that he had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it too!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Why do I miſapply my time on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſo imbecile? Maugre all my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves I have not ſeen her yet, Fairfax! Nor have I opened her letter! I dare not. Her Henley I am ſure is in it, and additional rage would be indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble madneſs! Neither is this the thing moſt to be feared. She has an expanded heart, a capacious a benevolent heart, and ſhe may have ſaid ſomething which were I to ſee, and yet do the deed which ſhall be done, it might ſhew me more fiend-like than even the foul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of my preſent thoughts. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation has done its work; it needs no increaſe. This quality of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in which they both glory, is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0201200107:8"/>
to recollect. I ſay, Fairfax, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſked their charity. Did I not ſpurn it from me, the moment I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by the offer? Be pity beſtowed on beggars: the partiality that ſprings from affection, or the puniſhment due to neglect for me!</p>
               <p>I will be with her ſpeedily, Fairfax! Though I linger, I do not relent. Such mercy as the being out of doubt can beſtow ſhe ſhall receive; the pleading world ſhould not wring a greater from me!</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0201200107:9"/>
letters I ſuppoſe; for I do not think ſhe will hope any thing from perſonal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view; I made her too ſenſibly feel her own inſignificance when laſt we met. I expected indeed an attack from her much ſooner, for the young lady does not want confidence in her own ſkill and courage: ſhe is of the Henley ſchool. However I do not intend to peruſe any of her epiſtles. I would ſend them back unopened, but that it would be an avowal of a knowledge of their contents; and I have no need to increaſe ſuſpicion, whoſe broad eyes are already glaring at me. But I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put an end to the witch, and engender black certainty in her ſtead! The imp ſhall appear, and ſhake horrors from her ſnaky hair!</p>

               <p>ONCE more, though but in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, let me converſe with my friend. I know it is deluſion, but it was the ſweet cuſtom of our ſouls, and well may be indulged. Ignorant perhaps of the cauſe, my Louiſa is at this moment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing me of a neglect which my heart
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0201200107:11"/>
diſavows. Let me as uſual give her the hiſtory of that heart: it is a theme from which ſhe has taught me to derive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
               <p>This is the fifth day of my confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have the ſame walls, the ſame windows and bars to contemplate; and the ſame bolting, and locking, and clanking to hear. It is with difficulty that I can at ſome few intervals divert my thoughts from the gloom which my own ſituation, the diſtreſs of my family, and the danger of a youth ſo dear to virtue contribute to inſpire.</p>
               <p>Nor do I know what at this moment may be the affliction of my friend. Should ſhe have heard, ſhe cannot but diſcover the principal agent of this dark plot; and exquiſite indeed would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0201200107:12"/>
be the anguiſh of her mind, could ſhe forget that fortitude and reſignation are duties. May they never be forgotten by me, during this my hour of trial!</p>
               <p>My ſhoulder I fear has received ſome ſtrain or hurt: the pain of it continues to be great, and the inflammation is not abated. The bruiſes on my arms have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in blackneſs, and their tenſion is not in the leaſt diminiſhed. The hands of thoſe bad men muſt have been as rough and callous as their hearts: they had no mercy in their gripe.</p>
               <p>There is a loneſome ſtillneſs in this houſe, that favours the diſmal reveries which my ſituation ſuggeſts. If my handkerchief do but drop I ſtart; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtirring of a mouſe places Clifton full before me. Yet I repel this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0201200107:13"/>
with all my force. I deſpiſe it. Nor ſhall theſe crude viſions, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous phantoms of the imagination, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due that fortitude in which I muſt wholly confide.</p>
               <p>For theſe laſt two days, Laura has pretended to grieve at confinement: but it is mimic forrow; words of which the heart has no knowledge. She per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives I ſuſpect her, and her acting is but the more eaſily detected.</p>
               <p>I know not whether it be not my duty to determine to exclude her; though that ſeems like cowardice. I think it is not in her power to harm me; and for telling, if ſhe have been falſe, ſhe has done her worſt. I never made a practice of concealment, neither will I now have recourſe to ſuch a fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0201200107:14"/>
expedient. Yet ſhe ſleeps in the ſame chamber with me; and ought I not to beware of inſpiring perfidy with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? 'Tis true my ſlumbers are broken, my nights reſtleſs, and the cracking of the wainſcot is as effectual in waking me as a thunder-clap could be. I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, however, to take the key out of the door, and either hide it or hold it all night in my hand. Miſchief is meant me, or why am I here?</p>
               <p>I am continually looking into the cloſets, behind the doors, and under the beds and drawers. I am haunted by the ſuppoſition that I ſhall every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſee this bad man ſtart up before me! What know I of the baſe engines he may employ, or the wicked arts to which he may have recourſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0201200107:15"/>
But he ſhall not ſubdue me! He may diſturb me by day, and terrify me by night; but he ſhall not ſubdue me! Shall the pure mind ſhake in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of evil? Shall the fortitude which ſafety feels vaniſh at the approach of danger?</p>
               <p>Louiſa, I will ſteel my ſoul to meet him! I know not how or when he will come! I cannot tell what are the vile black inſtruments with which he may work! Sleep I ſcarcely have any. I eat with heſitation, and drink with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. I have heard of potions and baſe practices, that make the heart ſhudder! Yet I ſometimes think I could reſiſt even theſe. He ſhall not ſubdue me! Or if he do, it ſhall be by treachery ſuch as fiends would demur to perpetrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0201200107:16"/>
Why do I think thus of him? Surely, ſurely, he cannot be ſo loſt as this! Yet here I am! I own I tremble and recoil; but it is with the dread that he ſhould plunge himſelf ſo deep in guilt as never more to riſe!</p>
               <p>Poor Frank! Where art thou? How are thy wretched thoughts employed? Or art thou ſtill allowed to think? Art thou among the living? If thou art, what is thy ſtate! Thine is now the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of impotence, thou who haſt proved thyſelf ſo mighty in act! Thou wouldſt not ſtrike, thou wouldſt not injure; and yet thy foe would ſink before thee, had he not allied himſelf to perfidy, and had he but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>left thee free. His moſt ſecret machinations could not have withſtood thy ſearching ſpirit. Thou wouldſt have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0201200107:17"/>
been here! Theſe bolts would have flown, theſe doors would have opened, and I ſhould have ſeen my ſaviour!</p>
               <p>He hears me not! Nor thou, Louiſa! I am deſtitute of human aid!</p>
               <p>Farewell, farewell! Ah! Farewell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; for I am talking to emptineſs and air!</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <p>Do I ſeem to ſpeak with bitterneſs of heart? Is there enmity in my words?—Surely I do not feel it!

               <p>I AM here—At the ſcene of action—ſhe is in the room above me, and I am ridding myſelf of reluctance; ſtringing my nerves for aſſault. I know not why this ſhould be neceſſary, but I feel that it is!</p>

I am waiting to queſtion Laura; but I ordered her to be in no haſte to come down, when ſhe heard me ring. I would not have my victim ſuſpect me to be here. I would come upon her by ſurpriſe, and not when ſhe was armed and prepared for repulſe. I will order the old woman to go preſently and open and ſhut the gate; as if ſhe were letting the perſon out, who came in when I rung.</p>
               <p>I expect, nay am certain, her reſiſtance will be obſtinate—But unavailing!—I ſay unavailing!—Neither houſe nor road are near, and yet I could wiſh the ſcene were removed to the dark gloom of a foreſt; emboſomed where none but tigers or hyenas ſhould liſten to her
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0201200107:21"/>
ſhrieks—I know they will be piercing;—Heart-rending!—But—!</p>
               <p>I tell you, Fairfax, I have baniſhed all ſenſe of human pity from my boſom: it is an enemy to my purpoſe, and that muſt be!—Though the heavens ſhould ſhake and the earth open, it muſt!</p>
               <p>Yet do not think, Fairfax, bent as I am on the full fruition of love and vengeance, I would uſe cruelty—Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me: I mean wanton or unneceſſary brutality. I will be as forbearing as ſhe will permit. I fear ſhe will not ſuffer me to careſs her tenderly—But ſhe ſhall never ſleep in the arms of Henley!—She never ſhall!—I will make ſure of that! My mind is reconciled to all chances, that excepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0201200107:22"/>
As I paſſed, I called at the mad-houſe; where I found Mac Fane and the ſcowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing keeper in high divan. They have been horribly alarmed. Henley has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted an eſcape, which he was in danger of effecting; but he is brought back, after having led them a ſhort chaſe.</p>
               <p>The apprehenſions of theſe ſcoundrels concerning future conſequences are very great, and ſwell almoſt to terror. They talked ſtrangely, aſked which way we were to get rid of him at laſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to be a dangerous enemy. Their thoughts ſeem tinged with dark lurkings, which they dare not own; and certainly dare not act, without my leave. Theſe fellows are all villainy! A league with demons would be leſs abominable!
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0201200107:23"/>
—I muſt cloſe the account, and ſhake off ſuch peſtilential ſcoundrels!—</p>
               <p>Laura comes! I will queſtion her a little, and then—!</p>

                  <p>I am returned, and am ſtill tormented by delay!—I cannot help it—I ſaid I would not uſe wilful cruelty: that were to heap unneceſſary damnation!</p>
                  <p>Laura began by ſoftening my heart with her narrative. Her angel miſtreſs is all reſignation, all kindneſs, all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence! She almoſt forgets herſelf, and laments only for me! This I could have withſtood; but ſhe has been bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally treated, by that intolerable ban dog, Mac Fane, and his blood hounds. Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0201200107:24"/>
how often have I gazed in rapture at the beauteous carnation of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, the whiteneſs of her hands and arms, and the extreme delicacy of their texture! And now thoſe tempting arms, Laura tells me, nay, her legs too, are in twenty places disfigured and black, with the gripes and bruiſes ſhe received. Gibbets and racks overtake the wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted villains! Her ſhoulder is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably hurt! It is inflamed, and, as ſhe acknowledges, very painful; yet ſhe does not utter a complaint!</p>
                  <p>Why did this heroic woman ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure me? By what fatal influence am I become her foe? Her gentle kindneſs, her calm, unruffled, yet dignified pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience I have experienced—Madman!—Idiot!—Have I not experienced her
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0201200107:25"/>
hatred too, her abhorrence? Did not her own lips pronounce the ſentence? And do I not know her? Will ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede? And ſhall I?—Never!—Never!—No no—It muſt be.</p>
                  <p>But I did rightly. This was not the moment. There would have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing barbarouſly mean, in making her exert the little ſtrength ſhe has with ſuch pain and peril.</p>
                  <p>I rode to Kenſington and procured her a lenitive, with which I returned. The purpoſe of vengeance excepted, I would feel as generouſly as herſelf; and even vengeance, did I know how, I would dignify—But do not ſurmiſe that I would retract!—No, by heaven! A thought ſo weak has never once entered my heart!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0201200107:26"/>
I am reſtleſs, and muſt return—Till it be over, earth has no pleaſure for me; and after I am ſure it will have none. No—No—I have but this ſingle gleam of ſatisfaction! The light is going out; give me but one full blaze, and I ſhall then welcome total darkneſs!</p>

               <p>FOR a few days after having ſecured my tormentors, I enjoyed ſomething like comparative eaſe: but the ugly imps that haunted me, in fiercer crowds again are ſwarming round me. I am too miſerable to exiſt in this ſtate; it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0201200107:28"/>
muſt be ended. It is a turmoil that ſurpaſſes mortal ſufferance! If ſhe will wreſtle againſt fate, it is not my fault. I have no wiſh to practiſe more upon her than is neceſſary. But the thing muſt be.</p>
               <p>Sleep I have none, reſt I have none, peace I have none. I get up and ſit down, walk out and come back, mutter imprecations unconſciouſly to myſelf, and turn the eyes of inſolent curioſity and ridiculous apprehenſion upon me in the ſtreet. A fellow has juſt now watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me home; deeming me a lunatic I ſuppoſe; for he had ſeen my agitation, and heard the curſes which I knew not were uttered aloud, till his impertinent obſervation of me brought it to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection.</p>

                  <p>I am here, and have talked with Laura. She owns ſhe is ſuſpected, and that her miſtreſs takes the key out of the bed-chamber door, when they go to reſt, and hides it: Laura by accident has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered where. She puts it on the ledge behind the head of her bed, but within the reach of her arm.</p>
                  <p>This has ſuggeſted a thought: I will wait here till midnight and ſleep have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0201200107:30"/>
lulled her apprehenſions. It will be better than facing her in the glare of day. Her eye, Fairfax, is terrible in her anger. It is too ſteady, too ſtrong in conſcious innocence to encounter. Darkneſs will give me courage, and her terror and deſpair. For it muſt come to that! It cannot otherwiſe be; and be it muſt! In the blaze of noon, when fortitude is awake and the heart beating high perhaps with reſentment, nothing but the goadings of deſpair could make me face her. The words ſhe would uſe would be terrible, but her looks would petrify!—By this ſtratagem I ſhall avoid them.</p>
                  <p>Nor do I bluſh to own my cowardice, in the preſence of Anna St. Ives: ſhe being armed with innocence and ſelf-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0201200107:31"/>
and I abaſhed by conſcious guilt, violence, and intentional deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Why aye!—Let the thick ſwarth of night cover us! I feel, with a kind of horrid ſatisfaction, the deep damnation of the deed! It is the very colour and kind of ſin that becomes me; ſinning as I do againſt Anna St. Ives! With any other it would be boy's ſport; a thing to make a jeſt of after dinner; but with her it is rape, in all its wildeſt contortions, ſhrieks, and expiring groans!</p>
                  <p>I lie ſtretched on burning embers, and I have hours yet to wait. Oh that I were an idiot!—The night is one dead, dun gloom! It looks as if mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, mildew, and contagion were abroad, hovering over earth and brooding
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0201200107:32"/>
plagues. I will walk out awhile, among them—Will try to meet them—Would that my diſturbed imagination could but conjure up goblins, ſheeted ghoſts, heads wanting bodies, and hands dropping blood, and realize the legends of ignorance and infancy, ſo that I could freeze memory and forget the horrors by which I am haunted!</p>

                  <p>My orders have been obeyed: the old woman, pretending to lock up her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, ſhot back the bolts, put down the chain, and left the door ready for me to enter unheard.</p>

Laura has her inſtructions. She is to pretend only, but not really, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs herſelf; and I bade her not lie down, leſt ſhe ſhould drop aſleep. When ſhe thinks it time, ſhe is to glide round, ſteal the key, and open the door.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <p>I am fully prepared; am undreſſed, and ready for the combat. I have made a mighty ſacrifice! Youth, fortune, fame, all blaſted; life renounced, and infamy aſcertained! It is but juſt then that I ſhould have full enjoyment of the fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bliſs.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <p>Heaven and hell are leagued againſt me, to fruſtrate my ſucceſs! Yet ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed I will in their deſpite—'Tis now broad day, and here I am, in the ſame chamber, encountered, reproved, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, frantic, and defeated!</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I heard Laura with the key in the door, I put out the candles. She turned the lock, the door opened, and I ſprang forward. Blundering idiot as I was! I had forgotten to remove a chair, and tumbled over it. The ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Anna was up and out of bed in an inſtant. The door opens inward to the bed-chamber. Her fear gave her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0201200107:35"/>
ſtrength; ſhe threw Laura away, and clapped to the door.</p>
                  <p>By this time I had riſen, and was at it. I ſet my ſhoulder to it with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den effort, and again it half opened. I puſhed forward, but was repelled with more than equal oppoſition. My left arm in the ſtruggle got wedged in the door: the pain was exceſſive, and the ſtrength with which ſhe reſiſted me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. By a ſudden ſhock I releaſed my hand, but not without bruiſing it very much, and tearing away the ſkin.</p>
                  <p>My laſt effort was returned by one more than equal on her part. But I imagine ſhe had ſet her foot againſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which gave way, for ſhe ſuddenly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0201200107:36"/>
came down, with a blow and a ſound that made my heart ſhrink!</p>
                  <p>Still I endeavoured to profit by it, though not ſoon enough; for the firſt moment I was too much alarmed. She could not feel pain or blows, and roſe inſtantaneouſly. I forced the door ſome little way, and ſhe then gave a ſingle ſhriek!—It was a dreadful one—and was followed by a repulſe which I could not overcome. The door was cloſed, and like lightning locked. I then heard her begin to pant and heave for breath—After a few ſeconds ſhe exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—Clifton! You are a bad man!—A treacherous, wicked man, and are ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own deſtruction!—I am your priſoner, but I fear you not!—Mark me, Clifton: I fear you not!</p>

                  <p>Mimic benevolence and virtue no more, Clifton! It is baſe in you! It is beneath a mind like yours!—You are a miſtaken man! Dreadfully miſtaken!

                  <p>Need ſhe have told me this, Fairfax?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0201200107:39"/>
Could ſhe think I knew it not?—But ſhe too is miſtaken. Her courage is high, I grant, is admirable; and, were any other but I her opponent, as ſhe ſays, not to be conquered! I adore the noble qualities of her mind; but great though they are, when ſhe defies me ſhe over-rates them.</p>
                  <p>I own her warning was awful! My heart ſhrunk from it, and I retired; tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care that ſhe ſhould hear me as I went, that ſhe might be encouraged to go to reſt. My well-meant kindneſs was vain. She never did confide in me, and never can. I heard her call Laura, and order her to ſtrike a light, ſet an arm chair, and bring her clothes: after which I underſtood, from what I heard, that ſhe dreſſed herſelf and ſat
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0201200107:40"/>
down in it, with her back to the door, there waiting patiently till the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>How ſhe will behave, or what ſhe will ſay to Laura I cannot divine. Moſt probably ſhe will inſiſt on baniſhing her the apartment; for ſhe never gave ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants much employment, and always doubted whether the keeping of them were not an immoral act, therefore is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in want of their aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>But let her diſcard this treacherous and now ineffective tool. I want her no more. I will not quit the houſe, Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax; I will neither eat nor ſleep, till I have put her to the trial which ſhe ſo raſhly defies! At her uncle's table ſhe defied me, and imagined ſhe had gazed me into cowardice. She knew me not:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0201200107:41"/>
it was but making vengeance doubly ſure. This experience ere now ſhould have taught her. Has ſhe eſcaped me? Is ſhe not here? Does ſhe not feel her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the raviſher's arms? If not, a few hours only and ſhe ſhall!</p>
                  <p>Let her not be vain of this ſecond repulſe ſhe has given me; it ought to increaſe her terror, for it does but add to my deſpair. My diſtempered ſoul will take no medicine but one, and that muſt be adminiſtered; though more venomous than the ſting of ſcorpion or tooth of ſerpent, and more ſpeedy in diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

admirably, aſtoniſhingly firm, in the texture of her mind. Laura has been down, babbling to me all ſhe knew. At eight o'clock, when it had been light a full hour, Anna, after once or twice croſſing her chamber to conſider, turned the key and reſolutely opened the door; expecting by her manner, Laura ſays, to ſee me ruſh in; for ſhe threw it ſuddenly open, as if fearful it ſhould knock her down.</p>
                  <p>She walked out, looked ſteadfaſtly around, examined every part of the chamber, and after having convinced herſelf I was not there, ſat down to write at the table where not an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had been ſeated. When the breakfaſt was brought, ſhe bade Laura take it away again; ſaying ſhe had no
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0201200107:43"/>
appetite: but immediately recollecting herſelf, ejaculated—<q>Fie!—It is weak! It is wrong!</q>—And added—<q>Stay, Laura! Put it down again!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>She then, with a calm and determined ſedateneſs, began to ſerve herſelf and Laura; treating this perfidious woman [For no matter that I made her ſo, ſuch ſhe is.] with the ſame equanimity of temper and amenity as formerly. The miſtreſs ate, for ſhe was innocent and reſolved; but the maid could not, for ſhe was guilty and in a continual tremor. "Be pacified"—ſaid Anna to her—<q>Compoſe your thoughts, and take your breakfaſt. I am much more ſorry for than angry at the part you have acted. You have done yourſelf great injury, but me none: at leaſt, ſo

                  </p>
                  <p>The benevolent ſuavity of this angel has made the light-minded huſſey half break her heart. Her penitential tears now flow in abundance; and ſhe has been officiouſly endeavouring to petition me not to harm ſo good, ſo forgiving, ſo heavenly a young lady! I begin to fear ſhe would willingly be a traitor next to me, and endeavour to open the doors for her miſtreſs. But that I will prevent. I will not quit the houſe till all is over!

                  <p>I will then immediately ſet Henley free, tell him where ſhe is, where I am

                  <p>It is now noon, and Laura has again been with me, repeating the ſame ſtory, with additions and improvements. Anna has been talking to her, and has made a deep impreſſion upon her. She is all penitence and petition, and is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

The peer began with circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory hints concerning the elopement—<q>An unaccountable affair!—No ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings had yet arrived!—Surmiſes and rumours of a very ſtrange and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable nature were whiſpered!—Miſchief, rape, nay even murder were dreaded!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I refuſed to interpret any of theſe inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations as applicable to myſelf. At laſt his lordſhip, after many efforts, ſaid he had a favour to beg of me, which he hoped I ſhould not think unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I deſired him to inform me what this favour was; and put ſome firmneſs in my manner, that his lordſhip might ſee I was not in a temper to ſuffer an inſult.</p>

He anſwered, for his own part, he had no doubts: he knew my family, and had always affirmed I could not act unworthy of the gentleman. But, for the peace of mind of Sir Arthur and the other relations of the young lady, he would eſteem it an obligation done to him, if I would declare, upon my honour, that I knew nothing of her elopement; of the place ſhe has been conveyed to, or where ſhe is at preſent.</p>
                  <p>I then retorted upon his lordſhip, that the preface to this requeſt entirely precluded compliance; that thoſe who whiſpered and ſpread ſurmiſes, and rumours, muſt be anſwerable for the conſequences of their own officiouſneſs; and that with reſpect to myſelf, I ſhould
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0201200107:76"/>
certainly, under ſuch circumſtances, refuſe to anſwer to interrogatories.</p>
                  <p>My tone was not very conciliatory, and his lordſhip knew not whether to be angry or pleaſed. But while he was pondering I thought proper to make my exit; and leave him to ſettle the conteſt between his pride and his puerility as well as he was able.</p>
                  <p>At my return I found a letter from my ſiſter, which I will neither anſwer nor open. I have my fill of fury, and want no more!</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <p>Damnation on their inſolence! They have been making application to the office at Bow-Street! A requeſt has juſt been ſent me, a very ſoft and civil one
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0201200107:77"/>
it is true, from the ſitting magiſtrate, that I would do him the honour to come and ſpeak a word with him, on an affair that concerned a very great and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able family. I returned for anſwer that I was engaged, and that I ſhould notice no ſuch meſſages: but that if any man, great or ſmall, had to complain of me, the law underſtood its duty, and that I ſhould be readily found at all times.</p>
                  <p>Whether this be the motion of my ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb and zealous ſiſter, or of the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant peer, is more than I can divine. But I ſhall know ſome day, and ſhall then perhaps ſtrike a balance.</p>
                  <p>I have no doubt that emiſſaries and ſcouts are abroad, and that I am watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I was this evening to have met Mac Fane at the Shakeſpeare; but I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0201200107:78"/>
will not go. Yet as it is pay night, the hungry ſcoundrel muſt not be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. I will therefore write a note to him, and invite him to come and ſup with me. He will be an agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion! But even his company is better, at this moment, than ſolitude.</p>
                  <p>I will not let my ſervant carry the note directly to him; for if they have their ſpies in the field, that might be dangerous. He ſhall take it to the Mount coffee-houſe, and there get a chairman to convey it in ſafety. I will tell Mac Fane likewiſe to come through the ſhop door; for I am only in lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and to ſtep immediately out of a hackney-coach. I laugh at their counterplots, and wiſh I had nothing more to diſturb me than the fear of being
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0201200107:79"/>
detected by any exertion of their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, even though my kind ſiſter be appointed their commander in chief.</p>

No!

She reſerves the meal of one day for the next, after having ſuffered Laura to eat her part; ſo that inanity, ſleep or other effects, if produced, would firſt appear in the maid.

And why? What cauſe? Is this the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their uncommon virtues?</p>
               <p>And you, Oh man! Did they not labour hourly, inceſſantly, with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſaints and the ardour of angels, to do you good? Was it not their ſole employment; their firſt duty, and their deareſt hope? Did they ever deviate? Did they not return urbanity for arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, kindneſs for contempt, and life for blows?—Can you, Clifton, dare you be thus wicked?

                  <salute>DEAR MADAM</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU have been kindly pleaſed to requeſt I would give you ſome account of the means we are purſuing, in hopes to obtain traces that ſhould lead to a diſcovery of the very ſtrange affair by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0201200107:89"/>
which we are all perplexed and afflicted. I am ſorry to ſay that I can do little more than narrate the diſtreſs of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parties, who think themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the loſs of the dear friend of my heart, and of the youth ſo well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of her affections.</p>
               <p>Of the grief of Sir Arthur, madam, you have yourſelf been a witneſs: nor does it ſeem to abate. I ſhould wonder indeed if it could; for though I wiſh to cheriſh hope, I own that the ſecrecy and ſilence with which this black ſtratagem has been carried into effect are truly terrifying.</p>
               <p>Highly as I eſteem and reverence the virtues of young Mr. Henley, I have been free enough to own to you, madam, I never was any admirer of the qualities
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0201200107:90"/>
and proceedings of his father. Juſtice however obliges me to ſay that he at preſent expreſſes a regret ſo deep, for the loſs of his ſon, as to prove that he has a conſiderable ſenſe of his worth. Money has been the ſole object of his efforts: yet, though his ſon had ſo great a ſum in his poſſeſſion at the time he diſappeared, he ſeems to think but little of the money, compared to the loſs which is indeed ſo infinitely more deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>While I live I ſhall love and eſteem Mrs. Clarke, and her niece Peggy; whoſe kind hearts overflow with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, both for my Anna St. Ives and young Mr. Henley. Well indeed may Peggy remember poor Frank. He was her ſaviour in the hour of her
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0201200107:91"/>
diſtreſs. She takes no reſt herſelf, nor will ſhe ſuffer her huſband or her brother to take any. They are all continually on the watch; and to do the men juſtice, they do not need a ſpur.</p>
               <p>Mr. Webb, her brother, with whoſe unfortunate hiſtory I ſuppoſe you are acquainted, gives proofs of zeal which are very affecting. The tears have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently guſhed from me, at ſeeing the virtuous anxiety of his mind, and at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting what that mind was, how and by whom it was preſerved, and that its whole activity is now exerted, with the ſtrong and cheering hope of returning ſome portion of the good it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived!</p>
               <p>I know, madam, how great your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0201200107:92"/>
muſt be, as well as that of all the once happy relations of a young lady of endowments and virtues ſo rare. Yet deep as this ſorrow is, I think it ſcarcely can exceed the anguiſh I feel; convinced as I am that my miſtaken, my unhappy brother is the cauſe of this much dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſery.</p>
               <p>I told you, madam, I would go to him. I have been, and could gain no admiſſion. I have written; and have received no anſwer. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, added to the perturbation of mind which was ſo diſcoverable in him when he was laſt at Roſe-Bank, do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm my fears of his guilt.</p>
               <p>But as it becomes us to act, and not to lament, while there is any poſſibility
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0201200107:93"/>
that action ſhould give us relief, I joined Mr. Abimelech Henley in his opinion, that we ought to apply to the civil power for redreſs. We firſt indeed prevailed on Lord Fitz-Allen to ſpeak to Mr. Clifton; but it was to no purpoſe: my brother behaved, as I propheſied he would, with diſdainful ſilence. I own I had ſome hopes that my letter would have touched his heart: I am ſorry to find they were ſo ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>founded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton having refuſed even to deny his knowledge of the affair to his Lordſhip, he conſented that application ſhould be made to a civil magiſtrate. But Lord Fitz-Allen is ſtrangely preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, and is perſuaded, or affects to be, that Mr. Clifton, being a gentleman, is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0201200107:94"/>
incapable of a diſhonourable act; and that young Mr. Henley and Anna St. Ives have eloped. The ſum of money Mr. Henley had in his poſſeſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms him in this opinion: and he has ſeveral times half perſuaded Sir Arthur, and ſome others, to be of his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Hearing this, and finding no poſitive accuſation, and that nothing but ſurmiſe could be preferred againſt Mr. Clifton, whoſe character was underſtood to be highly vindictive, the magiſtrate refuſed to do any thing more than ſend a polite requeſt, that he would come and ſpeak in his preſence to the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>My brother refuſed in terms of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace and defiance; and we returned
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0201200107:95"/>
home hopeleſs; yet again having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to watching the door of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's lodgings, as has been done for theſe ſeveral days. But we have learnt nothing. And what indeed can we learn? Mr. Webb and his brother-in-law have twice followed him on foot, to the livery ſtables; and have ſeen him mount his horſe, and ride out of town: but the ſpeed with which he went quickly took him out of ſight.</p>
               <p>The roads he choſe were in oppoſite directions: but that they might eaſily be, and yet lead to the ſame place. They are out at preſent; for their induſtry is unwearied.</p>
               <p>It is in vain to think of purſuing my brother on horſeback; for he muſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly ſee his purſuer. He went one time
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0201200107:96"/>
over Weſtminſter-bridge, and the other through Tyburn-turnpike up to Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington. Their preſent project is, the firſt time he goes out, to waylay both theſe roads, and to get aſſiſtants. Mr. Webb is a ſwift runner: but the chance of ſucceſs I am afraid is very ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! However it becomes them, and us, and indeed every body, not to deſiſt, till the whole of this dark tranſaction be brought to light.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0201200107:98"/>
I laughed at your prophecy!—It is fulfilled!—I am a gull!—The fleeced, cheated, deſpicable gull of the infernal villain Mac Fane!</p>
               <p>It was right that I ſhould be loaded with every ſpecies of contempt for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I have been the fool, the gudgeon, the ineffable aſs to loſe a ſum of money to him, which to pay would be deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!—I begin to hate myſelf with moſt ſtrange inveteracy! Could I meet ſuch another fellow, I would ſpit in his face—Fairfax, it is true—By hell I hold my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in moſt rooted and ample antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy!</p>
               <p>I find I have ſtrangely miſtaken my own character and talents—I once thought to have driven the world before
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0201200107:99"/>
me, and to have whipped oppoſition into immediate compliance: but it ſeems I am myſelf one of the very ſorry wretches at whom I was ſo all alive and ready to gibe, and ſpurn! Theſe are odd and unaccountable things! And it appears that I am a very poor creature! A moſt indubitable driveller! The twin-brother of imbecility! Ay, the counterpart and compeer of Edward St. Ives, and the tool of the moſt barefaced of cheats, as well as his familiar!—Well! I have lived long enough to make the diſcovery; and it is now high time to depart!</p>
               <p>I wrote to you but yeſterday: but events haſtily tread on each other's heels, and if I do not relate them now I never
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0201200107:100"/>
ſhall. I told you I expected the gambler to ſupper, by my own invitation—Ay, ay!—I am a very Solomon!—</p>
               <p>I dined at home. I knew not indeed to what extremes the St. Ives hunters might proceed: or whether they would make accuſation upon oath, ſufficient to authoriſe a magiſtrate in granting a warrant, to bring me before him; but the attempt muſt have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and abortive, I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to brave them: however I heard no more of them or their ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions.</p>
               <p>As I ſat ruminating on paſt events, on my ſiſter and her epiſtle, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on the zeal with which Anna St. Ives appealed to the letter written
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0201200107:101"/>
by her, which I had received from Laura, my curioſity was ſo far excited that at laſt I determined to read them both. I own, Fairfax, they both moved me!—This ſiſter of mine, enraged as I am againſt her, has ſomehow found the art of making herſelf reſpected. Her zeal has character and efficacy in it: I mean perſuaſion. I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſome of the ſenſations ſhe intended to inſpire. She cited paſſages from the letters of her friend that were dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to me! At the very time I was ſeeking to quarrel with Anna, ſhe angel-like was inceſſant in my praiſe!—And ſuch praiſes, Fairfax—! There was no reſiſting it!—She thought gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, nobly, ay ſublimely of me: while
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0201200107:102"/>
my iraſcible jealouſy, falſe pride, and vindictive ſpirit were eager only to find cauſe of offence!</p>
               <p>And yet I know not!—I cannot keep my mind to a point! Surely <hi>I had cauſe of offence:</hi> real cauſe?—Surely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution I ſought had juſtice in it?—She could not be wholly blameleſs?—No!—That would indeed be diſtraction!</p>
               <p>I then ventured to read the letter of Anna—On paper or in ſpeech ſhe is the fame: energetic, awful, and affecting!</p>
               <p>While I was reading this laſt Mac Fane entered, and ſoon put an end to my meditations. Did I tell you I had been fool enough to invite him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?—He had not been with me half an hour before I was moſt intolerably weary of his company!</p>
               <p>

After having vapoured of the feats of himſelf and the ſcowling raſcal his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league, to remind me of my high obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to them, and talking as uſual with moſt bitter malevolence againſt Henley, he ſoon began to deſcant on the old ſubject; gaming—To aſk a madman why he is mad were vain! I was importuned by his jargon—<q>He had been pigeoned only laſt night of no leſs than ſeven hundred pounds!</q> Repetitions, imprecations, and lies, all of the ſame kind, ſucceeded as faſt as he could utter them!</p>
               <p>I know all this ought to have put me upon my guard; and I know too that it did not. I believe I had ſome lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanity in my mind; a perſuaſion that I could beat him at picquet. I was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0201200107:104"/>
weary both of myſelf and him; was primed for miſchief, and cared not of what kind. If you aſk me for any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon, why, knowing him as I did, I ſuffered myſelf to be the tool of this fellow, I can only ſay I have none to give!</p>
               <p>I ordered my own ſervant to fetch half a dozen packs of cards, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined this precaution was ſome ſecurity. What will not men imagine, when their paſſions are afloat and reaſon is flown?</p>
               <p>To give you the hiſtory of how I was led on, from one act of idiotiſm to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or how after having loſt one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand I could be lunatic enough to loſe a ſecond, and after a ſecond a third, and ſo on to a tenth, is more than my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent temper of mind will permit. It is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0201200107:105"/>
quite ſufficient to tell you that I have ruined myſelf; and that there is not, upon the face of the earth, a fellow I ſo thoroughly deſpiſe as Coke Clifton; no not even Mac Fane himſelf! Below the loweſt am I fallen; for I am his dupe, nay his companion, and what is worſe his debtor! It is time I were out of the world—So miſerable a being does not crawl upon its ſurface.</p>
               <p>It is the very heyday of miſchief, and I muſt abroad among it. The exact manner of the cataſtrophe I cannot fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, but it muſt be tragical. I have ſomething brooding in my mind, the outlines of a concluſion, which rather pleaſes me. I have ſworn to avenge myſelf of Anna, diſinherit my ſiſter, and never to pay Mac Fane. Theſe oaths
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0201200107:106"/>
muſt be kept. Anna muſt fall! If ſhe will but deign to live afterward, ſhe ſhall be my heir. And for myſelf, I know how to find a ready quietus!</p>
               <p>My mind ſince this laſt affair is better reconciled to its deſtiny, and even leſs diſturbed than before: for previous to this, there ſeemed to be ſome bare poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a generous releaſe, on my part, and a more generous forgetfulneſs of injuries on theirs. But now, all is over! I have but to puniſh my opponents a little, and myſelf much, and having puniſhed expire.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>AS I have taken upon myſelf the painful duty of informing you of all that paſſes, relative to this unhappy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, it becomes me to be punctual. It is afflicting to own that our agitation and diſtreſs, inſtead of abating, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0201200107:110"/>
Finding it impoſſible to gain a ſight of my brother, I determined to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to queſtion his valet. Mr. Webb received my inſtructions accordingly, watched him to ſome diſtance from the houſe, and delivered a meſſage from me, that if he would come to me I would preſent him with ten guineas.</p>
               <p>He made no heſitation, but followed Mr. Webb immediately.</p>
               <p>Either he is very artful or very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this affair. One circumſtance excepted, he appears to know nothing.</p>
               <p>I promiſed him any reward, any ſum he ſhould himſelf name, if he could but give us ſuch information as might lead to the recovery of our loſt friends: but he proteſted very ſolemnly he had none to give; except that he owns having
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0201200107:111"/>
been employed, by his maſter, to invei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the lad away, who wrote the anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous letter, and whom Mr. Clifton, by practiſing on the lad's credulity and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſent to France.</p>
               <p>The valet indeed acknowledges his maſter is exceedingly diſturbed in mind; that he does not ſleep, nor even go to bed, except ſometimes toſſing himſelf on it with his clothes on, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly riſing again; and that he has ſent for his attorney, to make his will.</p>
               <p>I will not endeavour to paint my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations at hearing this account. I will only add that another incident has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, which gives them additional acuteneſs.</p>
               <p>I believe, madam, you have heard both my brother and my Anna ſpeak of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0201200107:112"/>
and deſcribe a young French nobleman, who paid his addreſſes to her, and who was the occaſion of the raſh leap into the lake, by which Mr. Clifton endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered his life? This gentleman, Count de Beaunoir, is arrived in London; and has this morning paid a viſit to Sir Arthur St. Ives.</p>
               <p>He enquired firſt and eagerly after my friend; with whom, like all who know her, he is in raptures. Sir Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur, forgetting his character, and the apparently rodomontade but to him very ſerious manner in which he had declared himſelf her champion, told him the whole ſtory, as far as it is known to us; not omitting to mention Mr. Clifton as the perſon on whom all our ſuſpicions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0201200107:113"/>
fell, and relating to him the full grounds of thoſe ſuſpicions.</p>
               <p>The aſtoniſhment of the Count occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned him to liſten with uncommon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to what he heard; and he cloſed the narrative of Sir Arthur by affirming it was all true. He was convinced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond contradiction of its truth, for he had himſelf brought over the lad, whom Mr. Clifton had ſent, with pretended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches, to a friend of his in Paris.</p>
               <p>The lad it appears, ſuſpecting all was not right, and finding no probability of returning, but on the contrary that he was watched, and even refuſed a paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, had applied to the Count through the medium of his ſervants, with whom he had formerly been acquainted, to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0201200107:114"/>
protect and afford him the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to England.</p>
               <p>The lad was ſent for, his ſtory heard, and he was then queſtioned concerning Anna St. Ives; and he had heard enough of the affair from Mr. Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech Henley, and from the ſervants, to know that the propoſed match, between Mr. Clifton and Anna, was broken off; and that ſhe refuſed to admit his viſits. When Count de Beaunoir laſt ſaw Sir Arthur, at Paris, he had aſſured him very ſeriouſly that, ſhould ever Anna St. Ives find herſelf diſengaged and he knew it, he would inſtantly make her a tender of his hand and fortune: and he had no ſooner heard the lad's ſtory than he determined immediately to make his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended journey to England.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0201200107:115"/>
My heart ſhudders while I relate it, but I dread leſt it ſhould be a fatal jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for him or my brother, or both! For he declared to Sir Arthur, without heſitation, he would wait on Mr. Clifton directly, and oblige him either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Anna St. Ives, or meet him in the field.</p>
               <p>Wretched folly! Deſtructive error! When will men ceaſe to think that vice and virtue ought to meet on equal terms; and that injury can be atoned by blood?</p>
               <p>The Count had left his addreſs with Sir Arthur, and the moment I heard what had paſſed I flew to his lodgings. He was not at home, and I waited above an hour. At laſt he came, and I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſhew him both the folly and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0201200107:116"/>
wickedneſs of the conduct he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing.</p>
               <p>He liſtened to me with the utmoſt politeneſs, paid me a thouſand compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, acknowledged the truth of every thing I ſaid, but very evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to act in a manner directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite. I very aſſiduouſly laboured to make him promiſe, upon his honour, he would not ſeek redreſs by duelling; but in vain. He anſwered by evaſion; with all poſſible deſire to have obliged me, but with a foregone concluſion that it could not be.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, madam, for writing a narrative ſo melancholy: but ſincerity is neceſſary; intelligence might have come to you in a diſtorted form, and might have produced much worſe effects. For
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0201200107:117"/>
my own part, I have no other mode of conduct but that of writing and of ſpeaking the ſimple truth; being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced there is no ſhade of diſguiſe, artifice, or falſehood, that is not immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in principle, and pernicious in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>I have been very buſy. I have ſent for the lad whom the count brought over with him, and have made enquiries. The anſwers he gave me all tend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our former ſuſpicions. He has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the ſtory, at length, of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he was inveigled away, and prevailed on to go to France.</p>
               <p>I next queſtioned him concerning his aunt; and he knows nothing of her, has never heard from her, and is aſtoniſhed at what can have become of her. He
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0201200107:118"/>
means, however, to go this evening to a relation's houſe, where he thinks he is certain he ſhall hear of her; and has then promiſed to come and let me know—But to what purpoſe? We ſhall find ſhe has been ſent out of the way by Mr. Clifton: and what further informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will that afford? None, except to confirm what needs no confirming; except to ſhew the blindneſs, craft, and turpitude of his mind!</p>

               <p>SO, Fairfax, you have ſuffered the lad to eſcape you; cautioned and entreated as you were! You know, I ſuppoſe, by what means; and with whom he is at preſent?—Well, well!—It is no matter—I have quarrels enough on hand, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0201200107:120"/>
enemies enough!—I would fain die in peace with ſomebody!—I forgive you—I ſuppoſe you did your beſt.</p>
               <p>It is exceedingly poſſible that this may be the laſt letter you will ever receive from me. Remember me now and then. Should Henley and Anna St. Ives ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive me, let them know I was not ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely blind to their worth as they might perhaps ſuppoſe. Shew them my letters if you will: I care not who ſees them now! Let the truth be told! I ſhall be deaf enough to cenſure.</p>
               <p>I have juſt had a viſit from the crazy count; a threatening one. A challenge has paſſed, and we are to meet to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>So it is agreed; but I doubt whether I ſhall keep the appointment. If there
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0201200107:121"/>
be one ſpark of reſentment in the ſoul of Henley, it is poſſible I may fail. I mean to give him the firſt chance. It is his by right; and why ſhould not I do right even to him, once in my life? This farrago of folly, this pride of birth, and riches, and I know not what elſe lumber, is very contemptible!</p>
               <p>Fairfax, the preſent ſtate of my thoughts forces more than one truth upon me. But what have I to do with truth, in a world from which I learned ſo much error that it was impoſſible for me to exiſt in it? Theſe wiſe people ſhould leave us fools to wrangle, be wretched, and cut each other's throats as we liſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermeddling: 'tis dangerous. But Truth is a zealot; Wiſdom will be cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0201200107:122"/>
in the ſtreets; and Folly meeting her ſeldom fails to deal her blow.</p>
               <p>My mind is made up: my affairs are ſettled, my lawyer has written out my will, and it is ſigned. You will find yourſelf mentioned in it, Fairfax. I have nominated my ſiſter my executor, and Anna St. Ives my heir. I have been reading Louiſa's letter again: it is full of pathos. She has more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding than I have been willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and I have relented. She is not forgotten in my will: I would not have her think of me with everlaſting hatred.</p>
               <p>I know not how it is, Fairfax, but I feel more compunction, at preſent, than I ever remember to have felt before. I am grown into ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>contempt; and the haughty notions, which were the ſupport
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0201200107:123"/>
of my high and ſometimes arrogant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, are faded. I could think only of Coke Clifton, and I now know Coke Clifton to be a very wretched dolt!</p>
               <p>Be not deceived by my preſent tone: make no falſe predictions in favour either of myſelf or Anna St. Ives. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair and fate are not more fixed than is my plan. My horſe will preſently be at the door. I ſhall mount him the moment I have ended this letter, and ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed directly to Anna. There, after all is ended, the enchantment too ſhall end, and the miſventurous lady and her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned knight ſhall both be ſet free.</p>
               <p>Should Henley, urged by deſpair to ſeek revenge, accept my defiance and meet me in the field, the conflict muſt be fierce, and ſuch as might inſpire terror.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0201200107:124"/>
To ſay the truth, were it not to prove myſelf his equal, perhaps his maſter and vanquiſher, I would not lift my hand againſt his life. It would be ſome relief to my ſoul to fall by his arm. He is a noble fellow, and I have done him wrong. Would he or Anna but charitably ſtrike, I would die bleſſing them, eaſed by the expiatory blow. Perhaps they are the only two beings for whom I ever could have had the ſame admiration; and, if what they tell me be true, admiration continued always ripens into love. They ſhewed affection toward me, and would, I believe, have loved me. But we did not underſtand each other, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take has been mutually fatal—Would I had never injured them!—But it is vain!—The die is caſt!—We are all fated!—
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0201200107:125"/>
Having accompliſhed my revenge, and accompliſh it I will, they cannot live and not be miſerable! They muſt curſe my hated memory, and blaſpheme againſt my honour!—It cannot be otherwiſe—Let our grave therefore be glorious! They are brave ſpirits, and will mock my power even to the laſt. I love their high courage. Perhaps they ſhall find I have a kindred ſoul!—Oh would they die forgiving me—!</p>
               <p>I know not well whither my thoughts are wandering—They perhaps may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to die—They may ſay it is their duty to live, even though doomed to be wretched—I know them—What they think they will act—Well, well!—Let deſtiny diſpoſe of events—To me all chances are welcome, all are alike.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0201200107:126"/>
As to this count, ſhould Henley re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe vengeance, I owe him no mercy. 'Twas he who prompted me to the fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic act that firſt made me the debtor of the man I have moſt injured. I almoſt contemn a foe ſo inſignificant—Not that he is deficient in bravery, or ſkill—But what is he?—What are his wrongs?—'Tis lunacy, not anger rankling at his heart!—Or if it were?—The hungry wolf-dog is no fit combatant for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed lion!</p>

                     <label>P. S.</label> Fairfax, a new terror has come over me. I told you of the letters of my ſiſter and Anna, and deſcribed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the effect they produced upon
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0201200107:127"/>
me. You may remember I read them previous to my laſt damned interview with the villain Mac Fane. I recollect having laid the letter of Anna upon the table, and that it continued lying there for ſome time after his entrance. I had my eye upon it, and meant not to put it in my pocket leſt it ſhould be left there, but lock it up as ſoon as I moved—I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got it—The letter is loſt—I have ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where, have enquired, have curſed; have threatened unheard-of puniſhment to my ſcoundrel, if he have purloined it; but to no effect. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts he knows nothing of it; and he looks as if he ſpoke truth—It contained a ſecret relative to Henley—! Should Mac Fane have taken it up furtively, as I ſuppoſe ſuch thieves are always on the

               <p>WHETHER what I am about to write may ever be found, or whether I the writer may ever be heard of more, are both very doubtful events. It may be of ſome uſe to mankind, ſhould this brief narrative hereafter be read; as it may tend to exemplify the progreſs of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0201200107:130"/>
the paſſions, and to ſhew after having begun in error the exceſſes of which they are capable. I ſpeak under the ſuppoſition that this paper may fall into the hands of perſons who know more of Mr. Clifton, and of the affair to which I allude, than even I myſelf at preſent know; or, if I did, than I have time and opportunity to relate.</p>
               <p>With that hope, and addreſſing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch perſons, I will endeavour, as long as I have the means and am able, accurately to recount the particulars of what has befallen me, from the time I was firſt beſet to the lateſt minute of my remaining where I am; whether my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval happen by death or releaſe; of which, though apparently beyond hope, it would certainly be wrong to deſpair.</p>

Oh, Anna St. Ives! Should thine eye ever glance over this paper, ignorant as I am of thy deſtiny, though too well aſſured it is a fearful one, think not, while I ſeem to narrate thoſe incidents only which have happened to myſelf, that I am attentive to ſelf alone; that I have forgotten the nobler duties of which we have ſo often ſweetly diſcourſed; or that the memory of thee and thy ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings has ever been abſent from my heart!—But why bid thee be juſt? To whom didſt thou ever do a wilful wrong? Oh pardon me!—Live on, ſhouldſt thou ſtill be permitted to live, and labour with redoubled ardour in the great cauſe of truth! Deſpair not! Heave not a ſigh, drop not a tear; but ſacrifice thy private ills to public good!</p>

                  <p>Before I begin, it is neceſſary to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that I had the ſum of eight thouſand pounds about me, in bank-bills: for it is this circumſtance which ſeems to have inſured my death. Our walk was to have ended by four o'clock, and the money to have been left at the banker's as we returned. I cannot however ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit myſelf of neglect. I ought not to have forgotten that money, under our preſent wretched ſyſtem, is the grand ſtimulus to vice; that accidents very little dreamed of daily happen; and that procraſtination is always an error.</p>
                  <p>As I was walking with the lady whoſe name I have juſt mentioned, in ſome fields between Kenſington and Bromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0201200107:133"/>
we ſaw Mr. Clifton paſs on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and I believe in leſs than a minute a man aſſault him, and fire a piſtol, with an intent to rob him as I then ſuppoſed.</p>
                  <p>I ran to his aid; and, immediately after the flight of this real or imaginary robber, I was myſelf attacked, and laid ſenſeleſs, by a blow I received on the ſide of my head; which, as there was no perſon in front able to ſtrike at me, muſt have come from behind.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw no more for that time of Mr. Clifton. The blow was very violent, and is ſtill ſeverely felt.</p>
                  <p>When I recovered my ſenſes, I found my arms confined by a ſtraight waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat; ſuch as are uſed to ſecure maniacs. I endeavoured to call for aſſiſtance, but the man who had charge of me, for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0201200107:134"/>
there were ſeveral, thruſt his thumb in the larynx, forced open my mouth, and gagged me. He has twice had occaſion, as he ſuppoſed, to uſe me thus; and both times with ſuch violence as ſeemingly to require the utmoſt effort mind could make, to recover reſpiration; the thruſt of his thumb was ſo mercileſs, and the ſenſation of ſtrangling ſo ſevere.</p>
                  <p>They brought me to a houſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly prepared for confinement. It is an old but heavy building, walled round, and provided with bars, bolts, chains, maſſy locks, and every precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to impede eſcape.</p>
                  <p>I was led up one pair of ſtairs, to apartments conſiſting of two chambers; the one roomy, the other much ſmaller; in which laſt is a bed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0201200107:135"/>
As ſoon as I was ſafe in the room, the maſter man among them, who as I have ſince learned is a profeſſed keeper of the inſane, ungagged me, took off the ſtraight waiſtcoat, and then they all left me.</p>
                  <p>I ſtood I know not how long in that ſtupor of amazement which the ſcene, and the crowding conjectures of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, neceſſarily produced.</p>
                  <p>At length, I rouſed my mind to more active enquiry. I then ſet myſelf to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the apartments. In the largeſt there was a fire place, and a fire; but neither ſhovel, tongs nor poker; except a ſmall ſtick as a ſubſtitute for a poker, with which I certainly could not knock a man down. The furniture conſiſted of a chair, a table, a broken looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, and an old picture, in panel, of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0201200107:136"/>
the ſacrifice of Iſaac, with Abraham's knife at his throat. It ſtares me now in the face, and is a ſtrong emblem of my own ſituation; except that my ſaving angel ſeems wanting.</p>
                  <p>In the other room, excluſive of the bed and its appurtenances, there was a ſecond chair, which with an old walnut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree clothes-preſs was its whole inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
                  <p>In this room was a cloſet, with ſeveral ſhelves almoſt to the ceiling; the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of them ſo high as but juſt to be reached by me, when ſtanding on a chair. I ſwept my hand along the ſhelves, and found them as I thought empty.</p>
                  <p>I then examined the windows. There were only two, one to each room; the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0201200107:137"/>
remainder having been walled up; and theſe each of them provided with thick iron bars, ſo near to each other as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit but of a ſmall part of the face paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them. There was a caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the front room only; and I found a piece of paper tied to the handle of it, on which was written—<q>You are cloſely watched: if you attempt to make any ſignals, or ſhout, or take any other means to inform perſons you are here, your lodging will be changed to one much more diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having nothing with which I could employ myſelf except my thoughts, and theſe flowing in abundance, I ſat medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and undiſturbed till it was almoſt dark. A little before five o'clock as I
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0201200107:138"/>
ſuppoſe, perhaps later, for I forgot to ſay my watch and purſe had been taken from me, with a promiſe that they ſhould be returned, I heard the ſound of diſtant bolts and locks, that belong to the outer gates and doors, and ſoon afterward of men in loud converſation.</p>
                  <p>The keeper and two of his aſſiſtants came up to me, and once more brought the ſtraight waiſtcoat, into which they bade me thruſt my arms. I heſitated, and told them I did not chooſe to have my arms confined. To which the keeper replied—<q>B*** my b**** eyes! None of your jabber, or I'll fetch you another rum one! I'll knock you off the rooſt again!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this ſpeech I conclude it was he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0201200107:139"/>
who gave me the blow with the blud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, when I was firſt ſecured.</p>
                  <p>As he ſaid this, he raiſed his blud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon; with which kind of weapon they were all three armed, and had locked the door after them. There was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and I obeyed.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as they had confined my arms they left me, and remembering the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes which I had in my fob, I began to fear they had come to the knowledge of this circumſtance; though I could not imagine by what means. Some ſhort time afterward, perhaps a quarter of an hour, the bolts and chains of my door again began to rattle, and one perſon ſingly came in. It was dark, and I could not diſtinguiſh his features, but I
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0201200107:140"/>
recollected his form: it was the gambler Mac Fane; the ſound of his voice preſently put it beyond a doubt.</p>
                  <p>Without ſpeaking a word, he came up to me and made a violent blow at me. I perceived it coming, ſprang upward, and received it on the tip of my ſhoulder, his hand driving up to my neck. From his manner, I gueſs it hurt him at leaſt as much as me; for his paſſion immediately became outrageous, and he began curſing, kicking, ſpitting at me, and treating me with various other indignities, which are wholly unworthy of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                  <p>His paſſion was ſo loud and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement that the keeper, hearing him, came up. Juſt as he entered Mac
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0201200107:141"/>
Fane ſtruck me again, and with more effect, for he knocked me down; and was proceeding to kick me in a manner that might perhaps have been fatal, had not the keeper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid not one word the whole time, nor as I recollect uttered any ſound whatever; and it was with difficulty that the keeper, who is even a more powerful man than himſelf, could get him away.</p>
                  <p>I was once more left in ſolitude and darkneſs; and thus ſat, with freſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for reflection, ruminating on this worthleſs Mac Fane, my rencontre with him and Mr. Clifton, the extreme ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy of his temper, and all the connecting circumſtances that are
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0201200107:142"/>
allied to events which I cannot now relate.</p>
                  <p>About eight o'clock my door once more opened, and a little boy of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, as he tells me, brought me a light and ſome food. The boy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined me to be mad, and entered the room with great reluctance, his maſter the keeper ſtanding at the door, curſing him, threatening him with the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whip, and obliging him to do as he was bidden! which was to releaſe me from the ſtrait waiſtcoat, ſpread a threadbare half-dirty napkin over the table, ſet the plates, and wait till I had eaten. The trepidation of the poor boy at ſetting my arms at liberty was extreme.</p>
                  <p>The door was not open but ajar, and ſecured by three chains, between which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0201200107:143"/>
the boy crept; the keeper ſtanding and looking on, with one arm leaning on the middle chain, and his head only in the chamber.</p>
                  <p>I obſerved that the boy had an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent countenance, though conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly under the influence of fear; with ſtrong marks of kindneſs in it, but ſtronger of dejection.</p>
                  <p>The furniture, the napkin, knives and forks, and every circumſtance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted the poverty of the man who is my jailer: and his proceedings proved there ſcarcely could be any guilt from which he would ſtart, to remove this ſuppoſed evil. The thought could not eſcape me, nor the jeopardy in which I ſhould ſtand, ſhould the money I had in my poſſeſſion be diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0201200107:144"/>
I ate what was brought me, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by the mildneſs and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my look to inſpire the boy with confidence. I have no doubt but he was ſurpriſed to ſee ſo docile a madman, not having yet ever ſeen any, and being from deſcription exceedingly terrified at the idea of the trade to which he has been forcibly apprenticed. I ſpoke to him two or three times, apparently to aſk him for the trifles he could reach me, but in reality with another view. I likewiſe addreſſed him two or three other times in dumbſhow, with as much mildneſs and meaning in my look as circumſtances ſo inſignificant would permit.</p>
                  <p>The effect my behaviour had upon
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0201200107:145"/>
him was very evident; and after begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in fear and confuſion, he left me in ſomething like hope and tranquillity. My priſon door was locked, the candle taken away, and I left in darkneſs. I was no more moleſted during that night.</p>
                  <p>My thoughts were too buſy to ſuffer me to ſleep. I ſat without moving I know not how long. The extreme ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all around me added to the unity of the gloom, and produced a ſtate of mind which gives wholeſome exerciſe to fortitude. Deep as I was in thought, I remember having been two or three times rouſed by the ſternneſs of the keeper's voice, which I heard very plainly, and which was generally ſome command, cloſing with a curſe, and as I ſuppoſed directed to the poor boy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0201200107:146"/>
My bed-chamber door was open, and after ſome time I removed into it, and ſat down on the feet of the bed, again falling into reveries which fixed me mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs to the place. I cannot tell what was the hour, nor how long I had been thus ſeated; but I was rouſed by the ſound of a door opening, and once more by the voice of the keeper, which I heard ſo diſtinctly as to doubt for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whether it were not in my own chamber.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time a broad ray of light ſuddenly ſtruck againſt the wall of my bed-room. I followed it with my eye: I was ſtill at the foot of the bed, and its direction was from the left to the right. I had much inclination to pull off my ſhoes, and endeavour to trace by what aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0201200107:147"/>
it entered; but on further reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I concluded it would be beſt not to excite any alarm, in a mind which cannot but be continually tormented by ſuſpicion and fear.</p>
                  <p>I paid ſtrict attention however to every circumſtance that might aid my memory, in tracing it on the morrow.</p>
                  <p>The voice of the keeper, for he ſpoke ſeveral times, was now much more diſtinct than before: he was going to bed, and the queſtion—<q>Are you ſure all is ſafe?</q>—was repeated ſeveral times with great anxiety, and was anſwered in the affirmative by a man's voice—"Do you hear him ſtir?" ſaid the keeper.—The reply was—<q>No—But I am ſure I heard him a little before ten.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0201200107:148"/>
The keeper however could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and in leſs than five minutes I heard my door unbolting. The keeper and both his men came in with their bludgeons. He aſked moroſely why I did not go to bed. I anſwered becauſe I had no inclination to ſleep. He went again to the windows, and examined the very walls with the utmoſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection; and afterward turning away ſaid—<q>Sleep or wake, I'll be d**** if you have any chance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He then left me, and I preſently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſaw the ray of light again, and heard his various motions at going to bed.</p>
                  <p>I paſſed the night without cloſing my eyes, and in the morning began to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine where it was poſſible the light
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0201200107:149"/>
ſhould obtain admiſſion. I placed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſame ſituation, and looking to the left ſaw the cloſet was in that direction, and that the door was open.</p>
                  <p>Looking into it I found that a part of the flooring, in the left hand corner, was decayed; and that the ceiling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath had a fiſſure of ſome width.</p>
                  <p>I thought it a fortunate circumſtance that ſounds were conveyed ſo diſtinctly into my apartments: though I ſpeak chiefly of the bed-chamber; for it was the loudneſs of the keeper's voice, and the ſtillneſs of ſurrounding objects, which moſt contributed to my hearing him in the front apartment. Not but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed ſtate of the building favoured the conveyance of ſound, in all direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0201200107:150"/>
I began to conſider how far I could improve the means that offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and, watching my opportunity in the courſe of the day, with my fingers and by the aid of the ſtick left to ſtir my fire, I removed ſome of the decayed mortar to the right and left, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the aperture on the inſide; but was exceedingly careful not to puſh any flakes, or part of the ceiling, down into the floor below. The attention I paid to this was very exact, for it was of the utmoſt conſequence. Nor was I leſs accurate in preſſing together the rubbiſh I ſcraped away into vacant corners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the joiſts, and leaving no traces that ſhould lead to diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>All theſe precautions were highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as the behaviour of the keeper
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0201200107:151"/>
had proved; for when he came into my chamber in the morning, as he did early with his cuſtomary attendants, he ſearched and pried about with all the aſſiduity of ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>At breakfaſt I was again waited on by the boy, and watched by the keeper. It was neceſſary I ſhould not excite alarms, in a mind ſo full of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: I therefore behaved with reſerve to the boy, though with great compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, ſaid little, and diſmiſſed him ſoon.</p>
                  <p>In the forenoon the door opened again: the boy was ſent in with the ſtraight waiſtcoat, and the keeper ſaid to me—<q>Come, ſir; put on your jacket!—Here, boy, be handy!</q>—</p>
                  <p>I once more heſitated, and aſked if
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0201200107:152"/>
Mr. Mac Fane were coming to pay me another viſit? He did not return me a direct anſwer, but replied—<q>If you will put on the jacket, you may go and ſtretch your pins for half an hour in the garden: if not ſtay where you are, and be d****!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After a ſhort deliberation, I concluded that to comply was prudent; and I very peaceably aided the boy in performing his office. As my back was turned to the keeper, I ſmiled kindly and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly to the boy; to which he replied by a look expreſſive of ſurpriſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed but that my mind had been moſt anxiouſly enquiring into the poſſibility and means of eſcape, while in my priſon; and that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0201200107:153"/>
this unexpected privilege was granted me, its whole efforts were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the ſame ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I walked in the garden overlooked, and in a certain manner followed, by the keeper and his attendants: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore traverſed it in various directions, without ſeeming to pay the leaſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the object on which my mind was moſt buſy. But the chance of eſcape, my hands being thus confined, appeared to be as ſmall in the garden as in the houſe. It is completely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a high wall, which joins the houſe at each end. It had one ſmall gate, or rather door, which was locked and bolted; and had no other entrance, except from the houſe. After having walked about an hour as I ſuppoſe, the keeper
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0201200107:154"/>
aſked me, in a tone rather of command than queſtion, if I were not tired. I anſwered—No. To which he replied, But I am. Accordingly, without ſaying another word, I returned to my priſon.</p>
                  <p>I will attempt no deſcription of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of my mind, and the continual fears by which it was diſtracted: not for myſelf, for there was no appearance, at this time, that any greater harm than confinement was intended me, but for another. The ſubject is torturing: but reſignation and fortitude are duties. My reaſon for mentioning it is that it ſtrongly excited me to ſome prompt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at eſcape.</p>
                  <p>I could think of none, except of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to convince the keeper it was more his intereſt to give me my freedom, than to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0201200107:155"/>
keep me in confinement. Conſequently, when my dinner was brought, and he had taken his ſtation, I aſked him if he would do me the favour to converſe with me for half an hour; either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately or in the preſence of his own men.</p>
                  <p>He did not ſuffer me to finiſh my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but exclaimed—<q>None of your gab, I tell you! If you ſpeak another word, I'll have you jacketed: and then b*** me, my kiddy, if you get it off again in a hurry!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſaid no more, but ate my dinner; caſting an eye occaſionally to the door, and conjecturing what were the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, by a very ſudden ſpring, of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chain, for he had only put one up, or of drawing the ſtaple by which it was held, and which, from the thickneſs
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0201200107:156"/>
of the wood-work, I knew could not be clenched. It was not poſſible, I believe, for mind to be actuated by ſtronger mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives than mine was, in my wiſh to eſcape: the circumſtance of the ſingle chain might not occur a ſecond time, and I determined on the trial.</p>
                  <p>I prolonged my dinner till I perceived him begin to yawn, and at laſt turn his head the other way. I was about twelve feet diſtant from the door. I roſe quietly, made two ſteps, and then gave a ſudden ſpring. I came with great violence againſt the door, but it reſiſted me, and, of courſe, I fell backward.</p>
                  <p>After the firſt moment of ſurpriſe, the keeper inſtantly locked the door, and, in a rage of curſing, called his aſſiſtants. They however ſoon pacified him, by
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0201200107:157"/>
turning his attention to the ſtrength of his own faſtenings, and ſcoffing at my fruitleſs attempt.</p>
                  <p>But this incident induced him to change his mode: he ſtood no more with the door ajar to watch me, but, after ſending in the boy, locked and bolted it upon us.</p>
                  <p>I was in full expectation of the ſtraight waiſtcoat; and his forbearance, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, was occaſioned by the ſtrict orders he muſt have received to the contrary. His threat indeed, when I attempted to ſpeak, is a proof rather againſt this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and I can ſolve it no other way than by ſuppoſing that his orders were, if I attempted perſuaſion with him, he would then be at liberty to do a thing to which he ſeemed exceedingly prone.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0201200107:158"/>
His fears for himſelf, ſhould I eſcape, muſt inevitably be ſtrong; and a man, who has waded far enough in error to commit an act ſo violent, will willingly plunge deeper, in proportion as ſuch fears increaſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſudden ſpring I had made at the door, combining with the ſuppoſition of madneſs, had ſuch an effect upon the poor boy that, hearing the door lock and ſeeing me as he imagined let looſe upon him, his fright returned in full force. His looks were ſo pale, and he trembled ſo violently, that I feared he would fall into a fit. I went up to him with the utmoſt gentleneſs, and ſaid—Don't be afraid, my good boy! Indeed I will not hurt you.</p>
                  <p>The keeper ſcarcely ſtayed a minute
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0201200107:159"/>
before, recollecting I had been long enough at dinner, he opened the door again, but with the caution of the three chains, and bade the boy take away.</p>
                  <p>I then began to accuſe myſelf of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy; but I ſoon remembered that every thing ought to be hazarded, where every thing is at ſtake. My fears were not for myſelf; and, while my arms were free, could I have come upon them thus ſuddenly, ſucceſs was far from improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Vice is always cowardly; and, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of weapons out of the queſtion, three to one are not invincible odds.</p>
                  <p>It now firſt occurred to me how pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it would be to conceal my bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bills, and I began to conſider which were the beſt means. I took them out, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0201200107:160"/>
their numbers, and endeavoured to fix them in my memory.</p>
                  <p>This was no difficult taſk; but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence required that nothing ſhould be left to chance, and I took the burnt end of my ſtick, and going into the back room, wrote the numbers againſt the wall, in a place which, from its darkneſs, was leaſt liable to notice. Indeed I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered there was little to fear, even ſhould the figures I made be ſeen, for I wrote them in one continued line, which rendered them unintelligible without a key.</p>
                  <p>I then once more took my chair, and placed it at the cloſet door; thinking that to hide them at one corner of the topmoſt ſhelf might perhaps be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſt place. I previouſly began to feel,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0201200107:161"/>
and, at the far end of the ſhelf, I put my hand upon ſomething; which, when brought to light, proved to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of a bundle of quills.</p>
                  <p>I felt again, but found nothing more there.</p>
                  <p>I then removed my chair toward the other end, and after two or three times ſweeping my hand ineffectually along the ſhelf, I ſtruck the edge of it againſt the wall, and more than half a quire of paper fell flat upon it.</p>
                  <p>This led me to conjecture that the ſhelf had been a hiding place, perhaps, to ſome love-ſick girl, and that it was poſſible there ſhould be ink. After another more accurate ſearch, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my other hand, with which I could
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0201200107:162"/>
feel better to the oppoſite ſide, I found an ink-bottle.</p>
                  <p>I took down my treaſure, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it: there was cotton in the bottle, but the ink was partly mouldy and partly dried away. However, by the aid of a little water, I preſently procured more than ſufficient to write down my num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But I wanted a pen, and for this there was no ſuccedaneum.</p>
                  <p>As the ſafeſt way of preſerving what might become uſeful, I returned my treaſure to the ſhelf on which it had been found; and for that reaſon began to conſider of another place for my bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes. After looking carefully round both chambers, I at laſt lifted up the old picture, and here I found a break in the wainſcot; in which was inſerted, laterally,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0201200107:163"/>
full as much more writing paper as the quantity I had diſcovered in the cloſet. I took away the paper entirely, leſt, if ſeen, it ſhould lead to further ſearch; and, twiſting up the bills, laid them ſo as to be certain of recovering them, when I pleaſed. The paper I put upon the ſhelf.</p>
                  <p>When the boy brought my ſupper, I aſked him his name, how old he was, and other trifling queſtions, to familiarize and embolden him; and learned from his anſwers that he had a poor mother, who was unable to provide for him, and that he had been bound apprentice to this keeper by the pariſh.</p>
                  <p>At laſt I enquired if he could write and read?</p>
                  <p>He anſwered, yes; he had been called
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0201200107:164"/>
the beſt ſcholar of the charity ſchool in which he was bred.</p>
                  <p>I then aſked if he continued to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe his learning?</p>
                  <p>He replied he loved reading very much indeed: but he had no books.</p>
                  <p>Did he write?</p>
                  <p>He had no paper.</p>
                  <p>Was there a pen and ink in the houſe?</p>
                  <p>Yes; but the pen was ſeldom uſed, and good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>Could he get me a pen?</p>
                  <p>If he had but a quill, he could make me one.</p>
                  <p>Had he a pen-knife?</p>
                  <p>No; he had forgotten that: but one of the men had a knife with ſeveral blades, and he could aſk him to lend it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0201200107:165"/>
And what ſhould he write, ſuppoſing he had paper?</p>
                  <p>A letter.</p>
                  <p>To whom?</p>
                  <p>To his mother.</p>
                  <p>I thought it not right to expoſe my ſtores to him, and therefore ſuffered him to go for that time, without ſaying any thing more on the ſubject. But my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him had pretty well driven all apprehenſion from his mind. I was cautious to ſpeak in a very low tone of voice; and, without being bidden, he had acuteneſs enough to follow my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>The next day, at breakfaſt, I gave him a ſheet of paper, and two quills; and told him to make pens of them if he could; one for himſelf, and the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0201200107:166"/>
other for me; and to take the paper for his letter. He looked with intelligent ſurpriſe—Where did they come from? was the queſtion in his thoughts; but he ſaid nothing. Madmen were beings whom he did not comprehend.</p>
                  <p>My kindneſs to him, however, made him deſirous to oblige me. I gave him a part of my breakfaſt; and he ate what I gave him in a manner that ſhewed he was not over-fed.</p>
                  <p>At dinner he brought me both the pens. I aſked him why he did not keep one to write to his mother? He ſaid he had written, but had cleaned and cut the pen over again. They were not ill made, conſidering that, as he told me, the knife was a bad one.</p>
                  <p>But what will you do for ink, ſir? ſaid
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0201200107:167"/>
he. I told him I had a little; but that I ſhould be glad if I had more. Perhaps, he replied, he could get one of the men to bring him a half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennyworth. I ſaid I had no money, and he anſwered a gentleman (Mr. Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, I ſuppoſe) had juſt given him ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, for holding his horſe; that he intended to ſave it for his mother, but that he would ſpare a halfpenny to buy me ink.</p>
                  <p>I took the boy's hand, and ſaid to him—<q>If ever I live to get free from this place, I will remember you.</q>—The emotions I felt communicated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and he looked ſorrowfully up in my face, and aſked—<q>Why, are not you mad, ſir?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The very earneſt but mild manner
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0201200107:168"/>
with which I anſwered—<q>No, my good fellow</q>—both convinced him and ſet his imagination to work.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid little more, but finiſhed my meal, wrote down my numbers, and gave him the bottle: but warned him, if he were queſtioned, by no means to tell an untruth. The boy looked at me again, in a manner that ſpoke highly in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, put the bottle in his pocket, and, as ſoon as his maſter returned to the door, removed the things and departed.</p>
                  <p>He brought the ink with my ſupper. One of the men had taken his ſixpence, but refuſed to return him any change; and the ink he had emptied out of the keeper's bottle. Such are the habits of vice. The boy related it with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſaid he dared not complain.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0201200107:169"/>
I had nothing elſe to give, I therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded the generous boy with a couple of quills, and four ſheets of paper for his own uſe; cautioning him to keep them to write to his mother.</p>
                  <p>While I wanted the means, I imagined it would have been a great relief to have had the power of writing down my thoughts; but I found they were much too buſy, and diſturbed, by the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Anna St. Ives and her danger, and by the inceſſant deſire of finding ſome means of eſcape, notwithſtanding a thouſand repeated convictions of its impoſſibility, to ſuffer me to write either with effect or connection. I did nothing but make memorandums; ſome of thoughts that occurred, and others of circumſtances that were preſent. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0201200107:170"/>
my papers in the wainſcot behind the picture, where I mean to leave this narrative.</p>
                  <p>The indulgence of my morning walk was continued; and on the ſixth day of my confinement an incident happened, by which I almoſt effected my releaſe.</p>
                  <p>Confiding in the ſtrait waiſtcoat and in the ſtrength of his locks and bars, and become leſs apprehenſive from this perſuaſion, the keeper had left me under the care of only one of his men; himſelf and the other were employed on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he wanted done in the houſe.</p>
                  <p>While they were abſent, the garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell rang. The voice of Mac Fane was heard, demanding entrance, by the man who was ſet to watch me,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0201200107:171"/>
and fetching the key he opened the gate without heſitation.</p>
                  <p>My hopes were inſtantly excited. I made a ſhort turn and croſſed him, as if continuing my walk, a few yards diſtant from the gate. He eyed me however, and I went on; but, the moment he was buſied in unlocking and unbolting it, I turned round, ſprang forward, and as it opened ruſhed paſt.</p>
                  <p>The violence of my motion overſet Mac Fane. The maſter, whoſe ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions had taken the alarm, was entering the garden and ſaw me. He and his man and Mac Fane inſtantly joined in the purſuit.</p>
                  <p>Though I was in the ſtrait waiſtcoat, yet I happened to be ſwifter than any of them. The keeper was ſoon the firſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0201200107:172"/>
in the chaſe: it was up a narrow lane, with a high-banked hedge on each ſide. A man was coming down it, and the keeper called to him to ſtop me. The man ſeeing my arms confined, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhouts of my purſuers, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to do as he was deſired. He placed himſelf directly in my way, and I ran full againſt him.</p>
                  <p>We both fell; but the man by the aid of his hands was up rather the ſooneſt. He laid hold of me, and a ſudden thought ſtruck me. They were bawling behind—"A madman! A madman!"—and I aſſumed that grinning contortion of countenance which might eaſieſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify, uttered an uncouth noiſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bite at the man. Terror ſeized
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0201200107:173"/>
him, and I again got away, the very moment the keeper was coming up.</p>
                  <p>I had not run a hundred yards further before I ſaw another man at a diſtance, and the hue and cry behind was as hot as ever. The hedge in this place was lower, and I jumped over it into the field on my right. There was a ditch on the other ſide, of which I had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation; and my feet alighting on the edge of it, I once more fell.</p>
                  <p>My purſuers profited by a gate, which I had paſſed. It was the field of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener, and a man was at work cloſe by. He came and helped me up; but not ſoon enough: the keeper arrived, and preſently after his man and Mac Fane.</p>
                  <p>I addreſſed myſelf to the gardener,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0201200107:174"/>
endeavoured to tell him who I was, and ſaid I would give him a hundred pounds, if he would aid me to eſcape: but my efforts were ſoon put an end to by the keeper, who threw me down, a ſecond time violently thruſt his thumb into my throat, and by gagging me prevented further ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Mac Fane however thought proper to give the man half a crown, and they all aſſured him I was a madman; which ſtory was confirmed by the man who ſuppoſed himſelf bitten, and who had joined in the purſuit.</p>
                  <p>The extreme malevolence of Mac Fane again diſplayed itſelf: but his treatment is unworthy notice, except as it relates to what is to come.</p>
                  <p>I was hurried back to my priſon, left
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0201200107:175"/>
with the ſtrait waiſtcoat on that whole day and night, and was fed by the boy; who ſhewed many ſilent tokens of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, though once more watched by the keeper and his two attendants, with the three chains up at the door. All converſations between me and the boy were for ſeveral days ended, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued overlooking of the keeper and his men.</p>
                  <p>After the keeper and Mac Fane had retired, I went into the back room, and was ſtanding with my face toward the window, which is beſide the cloſet. The behaviour of Mac Fane had been ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary as already to lead me to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he had a wiſh to take away my life.</p>
                  <p>As I was ſtanding here, I heard the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0201200107:176"/>
keeper's bed-room door open and ſhut again, and ſoon after the voices of him and Mac Fane in converſation. I liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened very attentively to a dialogue, the ſubſtance of which was to me much more alarming than unexpected. It was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, on the part of Mac Fane, on the policy and means of murdering me.</p>
                  <p>The keeper oppoſed him, ſeveral times mentioned Mr. Clifton as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable objection, and urged the danger of being detected; for he did not ſeem to revolt at the fact.</p>
                  <p>Mac Fane anſwered he would ſilence Clifton; of whom his favourite phraſe was that "He ſhould ſoon do him!"—which he repeated very often, with a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0201200107:177"/>
variety of uncommon oaths. He even ſaid that, were I fairly out of the way, he could make Edward St. Ives pay him the three thouſand guineas.</p>
                  <p>The curſes which Mac Fane continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally coupled with my name, and the rancour, the thirſt of blood which preyed upon him, were incredible. He a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times imprecated eternal damnation to his ſoul if there were the leaſt danger. The fellows the keeper had with him were of his own providing: they knew he could hang them both: they durſt not impeach. <hi>[Squeak,</hi> I recollect, was the word he uſed.] To take me off was the ſafeſt way. Clifton would in reality be an acceſſary before the fact, and therefore obliged to ſilence. Beſide—<q>He would do him! He would do
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0201200107:178"/>
him!</q>—This he confirmed by a new ſtring of oaths.</p>
                  <p>The keeper however continued averſe to the project, ſaid the fellows would hang their own father if he could not bribe them, that there was nothing to be got by putting me out of the way, and that he would not venture his neck unleſs he ſaw good cauſe.</p>
                  <p>While they were arguing the point, a loud and authoritative rap was heard at the keeper's door, accompanied by the voice of Mr. Clifton, demanding admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ on. He entered, and the whole ſtory of my eſcape was related, with that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring which their own fears inſpired.</p>
                  <p>Mac Fane darkly hinted the thoughts he had been communicating to the keeper; but, meeting repulſe from Mr.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0201200107:179"/>
Clifton whenever ideas of cruelty were ſtarted, he thought proper to uſe more reſerve.</p>
                  <p>The keeper concluded his account by affirming it would be neceſſary to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue me in the ſtrait waiſtcoat, and not to let me walk in the garden any more. Mr. Clifton aſſented to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but poſitively ordered my arms to be releaſed. There was no need he ſaid to puniſh me in this manner, and it ſhould not be. At the ſame time he gave the keeper a twenty pound note, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his orders to treat me properly, but to take care not to ſuffer me to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.</p>
                  <p>Miſguided man! How does your heart pant after virtue! How grieve at the ſlavery in which it is held! What
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0201200107:180"/>
will its agony be, when the full meaſure of error is come!</p>
                  <p>Yet this to me was the lucid moment of hope, for it ſuggeſted a train of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which ſeem like heavenly certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties—Mr. Clifton has made his attempts on Anna St. Ives, and they have been repelled! Even ſtill, and it is ſeveral days ſince, his efforts continue to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual!—It muſt be ſo!—The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of vice are fruſtrated by the pure energies of virtue: for, had they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, I ſhould be releaſed. Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheering thought! Pleaſure inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! Yes, Anna St. Ives is ſafe! Truth is omnipotent; and out of my aſhes another, and probably a more ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and determined aſſertor of it may ariſe! Clifton at laſt may ſee how very
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0201200107:181"/>
foul is folly, and turn to wiſdom! Would he might be ſpared the guilt of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing conviction at the price of blood!</p>
                  <p>Three days paſſed away, after my eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, without any remarkable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The ſanguinary malignity of Mac Fane was more than counterba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced, by the reaſonings of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and hope in favour of Anna St. Ives.</p>
                  <p>During my confinement, I had ſlept but little. Wearied however at length, by the repetition of ideas that were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, I was ſlumbering more ſoundly than uſual on the night after the ninth day; and was dreaming that my doors were unbolted, the chains rattling, and men entering to murder me; from which
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0201200107:182"/>
I was waked by ſtarting in my dream to run and reſiſt them. It was the real clanking of the bolts and locks of the houſe doors that inſpired this dream; they opened to give ſome one admiſſion. I know not what was the hour, but it muſt be very late, and it was completely dark. I ſoon diſtinguiſhed Mac Fane's voice. I jumped up, haſtily dreſſed myſelf in part, and preſently heard the keeper's door open—The ray of light appeared on the wall—I crept toward the cloſet.</p>
                  <p>The firſt word Mac Fane uttered was—<q>I told you I ſhould do him!—I told you I ſhould do him!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He kept repeating this and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, which I could not at firſt comprehend, cloſing each of them with
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0201200107:183"/>
oaths expreſſive of uncommon exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But he deſcanted almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly from Mr. Clifton, to whom his phraſe alluded, to me; adding—it was high time now to do me too.</p>
                  <p>His joy was ſo great, his oaths ſo multiplied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his aſſeverations ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, that he would tread me out, would ſend my ſoul to hell that very night, and other ſimilar phraſes, that it was ſome time before the keeper could obtain an anſwer to his queſtion of—"What does all this mean?" At laſt Mr. Mac Fane began to relate, as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly as the intoxication of his mind would permit, that he had done him [Mr. Clifton] out of ten thouſand pounds.</p>
                  <p>Had he got the money?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0201200107:184"/>
No—But God ſhiver his ſoul to flames if he did not make him pay! He would blow him to powder, drink his blood, eat his bones if he did not!</p>
                  <p>This was not all—He had another prize! Eight thouſand pounds! The money was now in the houſe!</p>
                  <p>He ſtopped ſhort—The cupidity of the keeper was excited, and he grew impatient. Mac Fane I imagine heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to reconſider if it were poſſible to get all the money himſelf, make away with me ſecretly, and leave the keeper in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. But he could not but conclude this to be impracticable.</p>
                  <p>I could not ſufficiently connect the meaning of all the phraſes that followed; they might depend as much on ſeeing as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0201200107:185"/>
hearing; but I underſtood Mac Fane was acquainted with the circumſtance of the money I have in my poſſeſſion; though whether his knowledge were gained from Mr. Clifton or Anna St. Ives, for they were both mentioned, I could not diſtinguiſh. He talked much of a letter, of his own cunning, and of the contempt in which he held Mr. Clifton.</p>
                  <p>The keeper however was convinced of the fact, for he propoſed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to murder me, and ſecure the money.</p>
                  <p>This point was for ſome time debated, and I every moment expected they would leave the room, to perpetrate the crime. Mac Fane had his piſtols and cutlaſs, yet ſeemed to ſuppoſe a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0201200107:186"/>
even of my conquering them. The keeper was much more confident—<q>He knew how to bring me down; he had no fear of that.</q>—Mac Fane remembered his defeat, and the keeper his cheaply bought victory.</p>
                  <p>They agreed it could not be done ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, unleſs they could catch me aſleep, and the unbolting of the doors would awaken me. They wiſhed the keeper's fellows to know nothing of the matter; they would claim their ſhare.</p>
                  <p>At laſt Mac Fane propoſed that I ſhould be put in the ſtrait waiſtcoat the next morning, on pretence of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me out in the garden; that perhaps it would be beſt to ſuffer me to walk there, but not to take off the ſtrait
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0201200107:187"/>
waiſtcoat any more; that then the doors might be left unbolted, and even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked, my arms being confined; and the next night they might come and diſpatch me!</p>
                  <p>The converſation continued long after this, and ſchemes of flight, either to Ireland or the continent, were concerted, and the riches and happineſs they ſhould enjoy inſiſted on, with great ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applauſe and pleaſure. Poor, miſtaken men!</p>
                  <p>They at laſt parted, with a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to execute the ſcheme of the ſtrait waiſtcoat. Mac Fane took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the keeper's bed; and he as I imagine went to that of his men.</p>

                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0201200107:188"/>
And here I muſt remark that Mac Fane either forgot or did not imagine that my immediate murder would be an impediment to the payment of the ten thouſand pound gaming debt, from Mr. Clifton; which fear afterward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated him ſtrongly. It could not do otherwiſe, the moment it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>According to agreement, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the keeper came, with as much pretended kindneſs as he knew how to aſſume, to tell me I might have my walk in the garden again, if I pleaſed. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I did not wiſh to walk. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſuade me, but he ſoon found it was to no purpoſe. He then ordered the boy away, who had brought
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0201200107:189"/>
the ſtrait waiſtcoat, and quitted his ſtation at the door in great dudgeon.</p>
                  <p>I ſoon afterward heard, as I expected, Mac Fane and him in his own room. Mac Fane curſed the keeper bitterly, and ſuppoſed that, for want of cunning, he had in part betrayed himſelf, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me ſuſpicious. The keeper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his behaviour and curſed again, till I imagined they had fairly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled.</p>
                  <p>Mac Fane however began to cool, and to talk of another expedient of which he had been thinking. This was to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon me. In this the keeper immediately joined, and began to enquire about the means of procuring the poiſon. The boy was firſt mentioned, but that was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0201200107:190"/>
thought too dangerous. At laſt Mac Fane determined himſelf to go to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and buy arſenic, on pretence of poiſoning rats, and to ſet off immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. On this they concluded, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently left the room.</p>
                  <p>My whole attention was now employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in watching the opening of the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's door; but there was reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend they would converſe ſomewhere elſe on their projects. I imagine how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they thought this the ſafeſt and moſt inacceſſible place, for a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dark I again heard the voice of Mac Fane, and they preſently came back to their former ſtation.</p>
                  <p>Mac Fane related the difficulty he had found in getting the arſenic; that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſhops had refuſed him; and that at
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0201200107:191"/>
laſt he had ſucceeded by ordering a quantity of drugs, for which he paid, leaving them to be ſent to a fictitious addreſs, and returning back pretending he wanted ſome poiſon for the rats, aſking them which was the beſt. They recommended arſenic, which they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him to make up in balls, and he ordered a quarter of a pound. They weighed it, he put it in his pocket, and they noticed the circumſtance, telling him they would ſend it home with the other drugs; but he walked away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending not to hear what they ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Mac Fane, glorying in his own cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was impatient to adminiſter his drug, and propoſed it ſhould be ſent up in my tea. The keeper aſſented, and the boy very ſoon afterward brought me
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0201200107:192"/>
ſome tea in a pot ready made, contrary to cuſtom, I having been uſed to make my own tea.</p>
                  <p>The keeper was at the door. I aſked him the reaſon of this deviation; and he bade me drink my tea and be thankful. I poured ſome out, firſt looked at it, then taſted it, and afterwards threw it into the aſhes, ſaying it was bad tea. I next examined the tea-pot, ſmelled into it, and then daſhed it to pieces on the hearth. I looked toward the keeper and told him there was ſomething in the tea that ought not to have been.</p>
                  <p>Seeing me take up the candle and begin to move, he inſtantly ſhut the door. His conſcience was alarmed, and for a moment he forgot the ſecurity of his chains. He even called up his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0201200107:193"/>
men before he opened it again; after which the boy was releaſed, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had time to tell him never to eat any thing that was brought for me. The poor boy noticed the ſignificance with which I ſaid it, and fixed his eyes mournfully upon me. I ſhook him by the hand, bade him be a good boy, and not learn wickedneſs from his maſter.</p>
                  <p>The remains of the tea-ſet were ſoon removed, and a freſh conſultation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently began in the keeper's room. Mac Fane was again enraged, and blamed the keeper; who began to ſuppoſe there was ſomething ſupernatural in my beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. He ſaid I looked at him as if I knew it was poiſon, and it was very ſtrange! Mac Fane ſwore he would doſe me at ſupper, and would go and make
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0201200107:194"/>
me eat it himſelf, or blow my brains out; but he preſently recollected I had not the ſtrait waiſtcoat on, and altered his tone. It was hoever agreed that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other attempt ſhould be made.</p>
                  <p>I now began to conſider all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; whether it were probable, if I ate a little, that the keeper ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it only a temporary want of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; what quantity might be eaten without harm, and if it were not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to watch the moment when they ſhould come, by night, to execute their wicked purpoſe, and to paſs them and eſcape? A little reaſoning ſhewed me that I ſhould be in the dark, in a houſe the avenues to which were all ſecured, and with which I was unacquainted; that the number I had to contend with
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0201200107:195"/>
now would be four, three of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with bludgeons, and the fourth with a hanger and piſtols; that releaſe by the order of Mr. Clifton was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; and that, if I began a fray, I ſhould excite cowardice to action; and, having begun, Mac Fane would ſcarcely miſs ſuch an opportunity.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons made me rather reſolve to perſevere in faſting; which remedy, though it could not be of long duration, appeared to be the wiſeſt. Yet caution was neceſſary, for, ſhould I make them abſolutely deſpair of poiſoning me, they would have recourſe to other means.</p>
                  <p>My reſolution was taken, and when the ſupper came I taſted a bit of bread and drank a ſmall quantity of water, after carefully inſpecting it, and without
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0201200107:196"/>
ſaying any thing more ſent the reſt away.</p>
                  <p>The keeper's door ſoon opened, the ray of light appeared on the wall, and a new conſultation ſucceeded. The keeper again was troubled with ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fears; and Mac Fane was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aving been alarmed at tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, I had from ſuſpicion refuſed to eat any ſupper.</p>
                  <p>After a debate, they concluded it would be in vain to attempt to poiſon me in my tea, for I ſhould detect it: they would therefore ſend me a ſhort al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance at breakfaſt, keep me hungry, and prepare my dinner for the next day. The keeper propoſed to give me nó breakfaſt, but Mac Fane ſaid that was the way to make me ſuſpect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0201200107:197"/>
They were both highly chagrined; but Mac Fane was much the moſt talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at all times, and the loudeſt in oaths and menaces: though I ſcarcely think even him a more dangerous man than the keeper.</p>
                  <p>In the morning, obſerving they had ſent agreeable to their plan a ſmall quantity, after a little examination I ate what was brought me, and the keeper retired apparently ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>It was far otherwiſe at dinner, when I abſolutely refuſed to eat; and their vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was greatly increaſed by my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting to refuſe the whole day.</p>
                  <p>Late at night a new council was held, and it was long in debate whether I ſhould be ſuffered to live the night out. At laſt the cupidity of Mac Fane pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0201200107:198"/>
and his fear of not getting Mr. Clifton's bond for eleven thouſand pounds, as he ſaid, though I underſtood he had won but ten, ſeems now to have firſt ſtruck him; and this induced him to deſiſt. I underſtood however that Mac Fane had ſtill ſome hopes from his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and conſequently that to faſt would ſtill be neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Their final reſolve was that, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Mr. Clifton ſhould have given Mac Fane the bond, they would then delay no longer: and, from the threats which he vaunted of having uſed, he expected the bond to be given the next day, when Mr. Clifton was to come to the keeper's, if I underſtood them rightly, after his viſit to Anna St. Ives.</p>
                  <p>This idea again conjured up torturing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0201200107:199"/>
images, and fears which no efforts I have been able to make can entirely appeaſe.</p>
                  <p>I began this narrative the firſt day on which I found my life was in danger, and have continued it to this time, which is now the twelfth day of my confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The deſire which the keeper expreſſes to poſſeſs himſelf of the money convinces me of my great jeopardy. He was eager to have committed the murder laſt night, during the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation I heard. That I ſhould eſcape with life from the hands of theſe wicked men is but little probable; but I will not deſert myſelf; I will not forward an act of blood by timidity. Were I to deſtroy the bank-bills, and to tell them they were deſtroyed, I ſhould not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0201200107:200"/>

               <head>LETTER CXXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</head>
               <p>OH my friend! I am eſcaped! Have broken my priſon and am ſitting now—I cannot tell you where, but in a place of ſafety. I have been thus ſucceſsful by the aid of Laura.</p>
               <p>It is now four days ſince I ſaw your brother. Lulled to ſecurity by the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0201200107:202"/>
manner in which I had ſubmitted to confinement, and imagining Laura to be ſtill in the intereſt of Mr. Clifton, though this ſilly girl is now a very ſincere penitent, the old woman began to indulge her in ſtill greater liberties. I warned Laura very ſeriouſly againſt any precipitate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, for I ſaw it was probable this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautiouſneſs would increaſe, provided it were encouraged.</p>
               <p>No good opportunity offered till this morning, when Laura was ſuffered to take the key of my priſon chamber, and let herſelf in and out.</p>
               <p>The moment ſhe told me of it I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what other obſtacles there were. Laura ſaid we might get into the yard, but no further, for there was a high wall which no woman could climb. I aſked
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0201200107:203"/>
her if ſhe thought a man could climb it? She anſwered, yes, ſhe had ſeen men do ſuch things, but ſhe could not think how.</p>
               <p>The abſence of Mr. Clifton for ſo long a time, without releaſing me from my impriſonment, made me in hourly expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his return. I therefore did not ſtay to heſitate, but deſired Laura to ſteal down ſtairs before me, and open the door, for that I was determined to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the wall.</p>
               <p>Laura was terrified at the fear of being left behind, for ſhe ſaid ſhe never could climb it. <q>Alas! What was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of her?</q>—I told her ſhe ſhould have thought of conſequences long ago; but that ſhe might be certain I would not deſert her: on the contrary, I would
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0201200107:204"/>
go to the firſt houſe I could find and ſend her relief, if I ſhould happen to climb a wall which ſhe could not. Though, I likewiſe added, it was weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly to ſuppoſe that men were better able to climb walls than women, or that ſhe could not follow, if I could lead.</p>
               <p>The aſſurance of relief in part qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted her fears: ſhe opened the firſt door, ſtole down to the ſecond, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, ſhe unlocked it, and we both got into the yard.</p>
               <p>The wall as ſhe ſaid was high and not eaſily climbed; but I had little time for reflection: the old woman ſaw us through the window, and was coming.</p>
               <p>To this wall there was a gate, equally high, but with a handle to ſhut, ledges
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0201200107:205"/>
running acroſs, and two or three cracked places that afforded hold for the hand. You and I, Louiſa, have often diſcourſed on the excellence of active courage, and the much greater efforts of which both ſexes are capable than either of them imagine. I climbed the gate with great ſpeed and little difficulty.</p>
               <p>The old woman was already in the yard, and Laura ſtood wondering to ſee me on the top of the wall, fearing I ſhould now break my neck in getting down again, and ſtill in greater terror at the approach of the old woman. I made ſome attempt to perſuade the latter to give Laura her liberty; but our turnkey is very deaf, and inſtead of liſtening to me ſhe ran for ſome offenſive weapon to beat me off the wall: ſo, once more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0201200107:206"/>
Laura I would ſend her immediate aid, and keeping hold of the gate poſt with my hand, I let myſelf down and with very little hurt.</p>
               <p>I proceeded along a narrow lane; I knew not in what direction, but hurried forward in great haſte; not only from the poſſibility of being purſued, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it began to blow and rain very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily. In leſs than ten minutes I came to a houſe: I rang, a man came to the gate, and I readily gained admiſſion.</p>
               <p>I was ſhewn into the room where I am now writing, and another perſon was ſent to me, who perhaps is the maſter of the houſe, though from his appearance I ſhould rather ſuppoſe the contrary. I aſked firſt if it were poſſible to get a coach; and he enquired where I came
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0201200107:207"/>
from? I told him, from a houſe at a conſiderable diſtance, in the ſame lane, where I had been forcibly ſhut up, and where my maid ſtill was, whom I wiſhed to have releaſed; adding I would well reward any two men, by whom it might eaſily be effected, if they would go and help her over the wall.</p>
               <p>He liſtened very attentively, ſtood ſome time to conſider, and then replied there was no coach to be procured within a mile of the place, but that a man ſhould go for one; and that I might make myſelf eaſy concerning the young woman (Laura) for ſhe ſhould ſoon join me. The look and manner of the man did not pleaſe me, but the caſe was urgent, the ſtorm increaſing, and I in want of ſhelter and protection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0201200107:208"/>
I then recollected it would perhaps be ſafeſt to write immediately to Groſvenor-Street, to prevent ſurpriſe as well as to guard againſt accidents, and I aſked if he could furniſh me with a ſheet of paper and pen and ink. He anſwered he feared not, but called a boy, and ſaid to him—<q>Did not I ſee you with ſome writing paper the other day?</q> The boy anſwered yes; and he bade him go and fetch it, and bring me the pen and ink.</p>
               <p>He then left me, and the boy preſently returned, with a ſheet of paper, an old ink-bottle, and a very indifferent pen. The boy looked at me earneſtly, and then examined the pen, ſaying it was a very bad one, but he would fetch me a better.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0201200107:209"/>
The man who was juſt gone had told me that nobody could be ſpared, to go as far as I required, in leſs than an hour at the ſooneſt; I therefore have time to write at length.</p>
               <p>I think there can be little doubt but that my Louiſa is long before this in Groſvenor-Street. I would not wiſh Sir Arthur to be informed too ſuddenly, I will therefore direct to her at a venture; but for fear of accidents will add to the direction—<q>If Miſs Clifton be not there, to be opened and read by Mrs. Clarke.</q>—In the preſent alarmed ſtate of the family this will enſure its being opened, even if both my good friends ſhould be abſent.</p>

Theſe ſurgical meddlers iſſued their edict that I ſhould not ſpeak; but they found I could be as obſtinate as themſelves: I would not ſuffer a probe to be drawn at me till I had written, for when they begin I expect it will ſoon be over.</p>
               <p>I remember I ended my laſt at the very minute I was about to mount my horſe. It was a wintery day. The rain fell in ſheets, and the wind roared in my face. My piſtols were charged and locked in my pocket.</p>
               <p>I rode full ſpeed, but I ſet off too late! When I approached the madhouſe, I heard the moſt piercing ſhrieks and cries of murder!—They mingled with the ſtorm, in wild and appalling horror!—I rang violently at the bell!.....A ready and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0201200107:215"/>
an eager hand ſoon flew to open the gate—It was Anna St. Ives!—A boy ſhewed her the way—It was her cries and his, mingled with the blaſphemies of the wretches above, which I had heard!</p>
               <p>Her firſt word again was murder!—"Fly! Save him, ſave him!"—</p>
               <p>I ruſhed forward—The noiſe above ſtairs was dreadful—I blundered and miſſed the ſtairs, but the terrified boy had run after me to ſhew me. I heard two piſtols fire as I aſcended—The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror that ſtruck my heart was inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able!—A fellow armed with a bludgeon was ſtanding to guard the door. My piſtols were unlocked and ready: I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and bade him give way—He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obeyed—I made the lock fly and entered!—The firſt object that ſtruck

my ſight was Frank, beſmeared with blood, a diſcharged piſtol in his hand, defending himſelf againſt a fellow aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blows at him with a bludgeon, Mac Fane hewing at him with a cutlaſs, and the keeper, who had juſt been ſhot, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring at his feet!</p>
               <p>I fired at Mac Fane—My ſhot took place, though not ſo effectually but that he turned round, made a ſtab at me, and pierced the abdomen almoſt to the ſpine. But he had met his fate; and the return he made was moſt welcome!—He fell, and the remaining antagoniſts of Frank immediately fled.</p>
               <p>Frank is living, but dreadfully hacked by the villain Mac Fane. They tell me his life is ſafe, and that his wounds are deep, but not dangerous. Perhaps they

               <p>With reſpect to myſelf, my little knowledge of ſurgery teaches me that a wound ſo violent, made with a cutlaſs in ſuch a part, muſt be mortal. But mortality to me is a bleſſing. To live would indeed be miſery. Torments never yet were imagined equal to thoſe I have for ſome time endured: but, though I have lived raving, I do not mean to die canting. Take this laſt adieu therefore, dear Fairfax, and do not becauſe you once eſteemed me endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to palliate my errors. Let my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to you do juſtice to thoſe I have injured. To have ſaved his life who once ſaved mine, is a ray of conſolation
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0201200107:218"/>
to that proud ſwelling heart, which has ſometimes delighted to confer, but has always turned averſe from the receiving of obligations. I would have been more circumſtantial in my narrative, were it not for the teaſing kindneſs of my ſiſter.</p>
               <p>Once more, and everlaſtingly, adieu!</p>

                  <p>As to a friend of my brother, ſir, I have taken the liberty to delay ſending the letter, till his wound has been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. The ſurgeons are divided in their judgment. Two of them affirm the wound is mortal; the third is poſitive that a cure is poſſible; eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0201200107:219"/>
the youth and high courage of the patient, on which he particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. I dare not indulge myſelf too much in hope: I merely ſtate opinion. Neither dare I ſpeak of my own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. Of the worth of a mind like that of Mr. Clifton, you, ſir, his friend and correſpondent, cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. The paſt is irrevocable; but hope always ſmiles on the future. Should he recover—! Reſignation becomes us, and time will quickly relieve us from doubt.</p>

               <p>I RETURN you my ſincere thanks, dear madam, for your kind congratulations; and think myſelf honoured by the great joy you expreſs, at my ſafety and the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Mr. Henley. I will not attempt to deſcribe my own feelings; they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0201200107:221"/>
but will endeavour to obey your commands, and give you the beſt account I am able of all that has befallen us.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe, I incloſe the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive written by Mr. Henley during his confinement; and three letters addreſſed to my friend, Louiſa, but never ſent; with a copy of a letter dictated by Mr. Clifton to his friend, Mr. Fairfax. To theſe be pleaſed to add the following particulars of what paſſed after Mr. Henley's narrative breaks off, and the ſudden interruption of my third letter by terror.</p>
               <p>Mr. Henley heard but had not time to write their laſt conſultation. It was the eagerneſs of the keeper which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the reluctance of Mac Fane to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0201200107:222"/>
the murder, till he ſhould have procured the bond of Mr. Clifton. The keeper was violent: he had bargained with his two men to aſſiſt in the murder, for fifty pounds each; and he told Mac Fane, if he would not conſent, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without him, and he ſhould have no ſhare of the eight thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>This argument had its effect: Mac Fane had ſome doubts relative to the money won of Mr. Clifton; and four thouſand pounds was a temptation not to be reſiſted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Henley omitted mentioning a circumſtance that occurred of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he did not know the meaning of it. Probably they had planned it out of his hearing. The day before the attack, the keeper returned
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0201200107:223"/>
him his watch and purſe, with the ſame ſum, but not, as Mr. Henley thinks, the ſame pieces, it contained when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. The purpoſe of this, it appears, was to make him believe the keeper a man of his word.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the intended mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, previous to the aſſault, the keeper came up to Mr. Henley; but not into the room. He talked to him with the uſual ſecurity of his chains, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Mr. Henley ſhould deliver up the bank-bills, which the keeper now told him he knew to be in his poſſeſſion; with a promiſe that they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, as the watch and purſe had been.</p>
               <p>An artifice ſo ſhallow was not likely to impoſe on Mr. Henley. He had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined how to act, relative to the bank
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0201200107:224"/>
bills, and anſwered it was true they were in his poſſeſſion; but that he would not deliver them to the keeping of any other. Immediately after this repulſe, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Mac Fane, and the two attendants aſcended.</p>
               <p>The keeper (I ſpeak after Mr. Henley) was much the moſt confident, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly fearful that Mr. Henley ſhould ſlip by them. He therefore ſtationed one of his men at the outſide of the door, which he ordered him to lock and guard. Himſelf, Mac Fane, and the other entered the room; the keeper and the man each with a bludgeon, and Mac Fane with a pair of piſtols and his cutlaſs hanging by his ſide.</p>
               <p>Mr. Henley had purpoſely kept up a good fire, and had the bank bills in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0201200107:225"/>
his hand. He bade them keep off a moment, as if he wiſhed to parley; and they, deſirous of having the bills quietly, remained where they were. Mr. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley then took the bills one by one, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the amount of each to convince them that the whole ſum was there, and then ſuddenly thruſt them into the fire. They all ruſhed forward to ſave them, and this was the lucky moment on which Mr. Henley ſeized the two arms of Mac Fane, who, on account of his weapons, was the principal object, and who, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to fire at him, in the ſtruggle ſhot the keeper. The other piſtol Mr. Henley wreſted from him, during which conteſt it went off, but without doing miſchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0201200107:226"/>
Mac Fane then drew his hanger, and made ſeveral cuts at Mr. Henley, who was attacked on the other ſide by the keeper's man.</p>
               <p>In the heat of this conflict Mr. Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton arrived; and what then followed, his letter will inform you.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary I ſhould now ſay a word of myſelf, and of the ſmall part which I had in this very dreadful affair. And here I muſt remind you of the boy, ſo often mentioned in Mr. Henley's nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; for to him, perhaps, we all owe our ſafety. At leaſt, had it not been for him, Mr. Clifton could not certainly have gained admiſſion.</p>
               <p>The poor fellow heard and ſaw enough to let him underſtand ſome ſtrange crime was in agitation. He has great acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0201200107:227"/>
and ſenſibility: he looked at me when I firſt came, in a very ſignificant manner; and would have ſpoken had he dared.</p>
               <p>The door of the room in which I was ſhut was both locked and bolted; but the man that was ſet to guard it was wanted, for a more blood-thirſty purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I need not inform you how much my fears were alarmed, the moment I found myſelf in the cuſtody of the man by whom I had at firſt been ſeized. But how infinitely was my terror increaſed when I heard the voice of Frank, which I did very diſtinctly, and preſently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the horror about to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted! My ſhrieks were inceſſant! The poor boy heard them, and though ſhrieking with terror almoſt as violent as
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0201200107:228"/>
my own, yet had the preſence of mind to come and ſet me free.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton's ringing was heard at the ſame moment. The top bolt of the gate was high, and I opened it with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; but deſpair lent me force. It certainly could not have been opened time enough by the boy.</p>
               <p>Of this and the following ſcene, and of the agonizing ſenſations that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them, I will attempt no further deſcription. I will now only relate by what means, and whoſe aid, we left this houſe of horror.</p>
               <p>You know, madam, with what activity my dear Louiſa exerted herſelf, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed every expedient in her power. You are likewiſe acquainted with the zeal of Mrs. Clarke, her niece Peggy,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0201200107:229"/>
and the two men, her huſband and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Their ardour increaſed rather than abated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Webb, whoſe watchings and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts were inceſſant, ſaw Mac Fane ſtep out of a hackney-coach into the ſhop where Mr. Clifton lodges. This I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to have happened on the ninth evening of my confinement. It was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural that this circumſtance ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately excite ſuſpicion and alarm. The coach was diſmiſſed, Mac Fane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and Mr. Webb continued ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering about the door, waiting in expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſeeing him come out, till two o'clock in the morning, but waiting in vain: after which, concluding that he had miſſed him, he quitted his poſt.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, by very diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0201200107:230"/>
he found out Mac Fane's lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but he had not been at home all night. The ſame ineffectual ſearch was continued during that and the next day; but, on the morning of deliverance, Mr. Webb met a perſon with whom he had formerly been acquainted, who told him of the houſe hired by the keeper, and mentioned the names of his two aſſiſtants, with rumours and ſurmiſes ſufficiently dark and unintelligible, but enough to make Mr. Webb ſuppoſe it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the perſons he was in ſearch of were there confined.</p>
               <p>The intelligence was immediately brought to Louiſa and Sir Arthur, and application as immediately made to the magiſtracy. Webb had obtained very accurate information of the ſite of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0201200107:231"/>
the houſe; and, what was more effectual, had prevailed on his informer to lend his aid.</p>
               <p>The relief he brought, though too late to prevent miſchief, was not wholly uſeleſs; Mr. Clifton was the firſt object of our care; for Mr. Henley, though bruiſed, cut, and mangled, has received no ſerious injury. Laura was likewiſe ſent for and relieved from her priſon. Proper conveyances were ſoon provided, and we all removed as faſt as poſſible from this ſcene of horror.</p>
               <p>You may be ſure, madam, we did not forget to bring the boy with us. Mr. Henley has an affection for him, which the poor fellow very ſincerely returns; and finds himſelf relieved from the moſt
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0201200107:232"/>
miſerable of ſituations, and placed in the moſt happy.</p>
               <p>That I may wholly acquit myſelf of the taſk I have undertaken, I muſt juſt mention the Count de Beaunoir. He is a gentleman of the moſt pleaſant tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Urbanity is his diſtinctive mark, for in this quality moſt of his flights originate. He has thought himſelf my admirer, but in reality he is the general admirer of whatever he ſuppoſes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. When he was told of my being affianced to Mr. Henley, inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing chagrin, he broke into raptures at our mutual happineſs, and how much it was merited. He does not ſeem to underſtand the ſelfiſhneſs of jealouſy.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, madam, you have not heard the laſt accounts of the phyſical gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0201200107:233"/>
relative to Mr. Clifton. The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon who firſt gave hope is now poſitive of a cure; and his opponents begin to own it is not impoſſible, but they will not yet allow that Mr. Clifton is out of danger.</p>
               <p>The Count de Beaunoir has paid Mr. Clifton the utmoſt attention; he viſits him twice a day, and, according to the accounts my friend gives me, infuſes a ſpirit of benevolence and affection into his viſits which are highly honourable to his heart. Indeed I and Mr. Henley have ſeveral times met him there: for you may well imagine, madam, we are not the leaſt attentive of Mr. Clifton's viſitors. It is at preſent the ſole ſtudy of Mr. Henley, which way beſt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs himſelf to a heart and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0201200107:234"/>
ſo capable of generous ſenſations, and noble energies. There is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to conſiſtency in the human mind, which will not admit of any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and abſolute change; it muſt be gradual: but thus much may with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty be ſaid, Mr. Clifton does not at preſent, and I hope will never again, treat with complacency thoſe vindictive but erroneous notions which had ſo nearly proved deſtructive to all. He makes no profeſſions; but ſo much the better; he thinks them the more ſtrongly. His mind preſerves its uſual tone; is ſometimes diſturbed even to exceſs, and bitterly angry, almoſt to phrenſy, at its own miſtakes; but has loſt none of thoſe quick and powerful qualities, by which it is ſo highly diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0201200107:235"/>
Sir Arthur, madam, has deſired me to communicate a circumſtance, which I ſhall readily do, without the falſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of ſuppoſing that I am not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſon. It is agreed, between him and Mr. Abimelech Henley, that the marriage between me and Mr. Frank Henley ſhall take place in a month; to which I thought it my duty to aſſent. I am ſorry, madam, that Lord Fitz-Allen ſhould continue to imagine his honour will be ſullied by this marriage: but I am in like manner ſorry for a thouſand follies, which I daily ſee in the world, without having the immediate power of correcting one of them.</p>

               <p>HOW violent and reiterated are the conflicts, between truth and error, in every mind of ardour!—And, of all errors, the love of ſelf is the moſt rooted, the leaſt eaſy to detect, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely difficult to eradicate. We

can pardon ourſelves any thing, except a want of ſelf-reſpect; but that is into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>
               <p>I deſcribed, in my laſt <note n="*" place="margin">Omitted.</note>, the diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied ſtate of mind of Mr. Clifton. But, while he imagined he ſhould die and ſoon loſe all memory of a ſcene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo irkſome to him, his diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was trifling, compared to what it is at preſent. Repugnant as the idea was to his habitual feelings, ſtill I have more than half convinced him that ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide is an act as cowardly as it is cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal. Yet to live and face the world, loaded as he imagines with unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable crimes and everlaſting igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, is a thing to which he knows not

how to conſent. To combat this new miſtake, into which he has fallen, has for ſome time paſt been my chief em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. No common efforts could aſſuage the turbulence of his tempeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſoul. Energy ſuperior even to his own was neceſſary, to ſubject and calm this perturbation. But, in the ſimplicity of truth, this energy was eaſy to be found: it is from ſelf-diſtruſt, confuſion or cowardice, if it ever fail.</p>
               <p>I have juſt left him, and our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation will give you the beſt hiſtory of his mind, which is well worthy our ſtudy. I found him verging even toward delirium, and a fever coming on, which if not impeded might ſoon be fatal.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0201200107:246"/>
having juſt finiſhed a letter to his friend. Louiſa had deſcribed the ſtate of his mind, and I reſolved to catch its tone, that I might the more certainly command his attention. Without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and as if continuing a chain of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, he addreſſed me; with his eye fixed, in all the ardour of enquiry.</p>
               <p>What is man?—What are his func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, qualities, and uſes?—Does he not ſleep trembling, live envying, and die curſing?—And is this worth aught?—Is it to be endured?—Why do I ſuffer life thus to be impoſed upon me?</p>
               <p>It is not ſuffering: or, if it be, ſuch ſufferings are of our own creation—To the virtuous and the wiſe, life is joy and bliſs.</p>
               <p>Perhaps ſo—Wiſdom there may be,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0201200107:247"/>
and truth and virtue. And, for the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and the wiſe, the full ſtream of pleaſure may richly flow: but not for me! Pretend not that I may walk with the gods! I who have been the inmate of fiends! I, who propoſed glory to myſelf from the moſt contemptible of purſuits! I, who could dangle after co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettes and prudes; feed on and inflate myſelf with the baubles of a beauty's toilette; and, in the book of vanity, inſcribe myſelf a great hero, a mighty conqueror, for having heaped ridicule on the ridiculous; or brought innocence to ſhame, miſery, and deſtruction! And this I did with a light and vain heart! Did it laughing, boaſting, exulting! Satanic dog! Peſt of hell! What! Stretch ſouls on the rack, and then girn
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0201200107:248"/>
and mock at them for lying there! 'Tis the ſport of devils, and by devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented!</p>
               <p>Your preſent indignation is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both to your heart and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Oh, flatter me not!—Vain, ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious coxcomb!—I ſpread my wings, crowed in conceit, threatened, reſolved, laughed at oppoſition, and kicked the world before me!—Oh, it was who but I!—And what was it I propoſed?—Fair conqueſt?—Honourable oppoſition?—No!—It was treachery, covert malice, and cowardly conſpiracy!—A league with hell-dogs!—Horrible, blood-thirſty villains!—And baffled too; defeated, after all this infernal enginery! Nay, had I been ſo wholly devil as to have
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0201200107:249"/>
joined in murder, what would have followed? Why they would next have murdered me; and for the juſtice of the ſecond murder would have hoped par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, even for the hell-born guilt of the firſt!</p>
               <p>Do not, while you deteſt and ſhun one crime, plunge into a greater. This agony is for having been unjuſt to others; you are now ſtill more unjuſt to yourſelf. You will not ſuppoſe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf capable of a ſingle virtue: yet, in your moſt miſtaken moments, you never could be ſo illiberal to your enemies.</p>
               <p>Would you perſuade me I am not a moſt guilty, foul, and hateful mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter?—Oh be more worthy of yourſelf, avoid me, deteſt me, curſe me!</p>
               <p>I will anſwer when you are more calm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0201200107:250"/>
Calm?—Never, while this degraded being ſhall continue, ſhall ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come!—I calm? Sleeping or waking, I at peace? I pardon hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, treachery, blows, bruiſes, priſons, chains, poiſon, rape and murder? Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of wrath deſcend, point here your flaming ſwords, annihilate all memory of what manhood and honour were, and fit me for the ſociety of the damned!</p>
               <p>Forbear!—(Never before did I addreſs him in ſuch a voice—The laſt dreadful word of his ſentence was drowned, by my ſtern and awful vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; which reaſon dictated as the only means of recalling his maddening thoughts, from the deſpair and horror into which they were hurrying—I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued)—Frantic man, forbear! Recall your wild ſpirits, and command them
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0201200107:251"/>
to order. How long will you ſuffer this petty ſlavery? How long ſhall the giant rage, and expend his ſtrength, in tearing up ſtubble and rending ſtraws?—Stretch forth your hand, and graſp the oak—Labours worthy of your Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean mind await and invite you. Away to the temple of Error; ſhake its pillars, and make its foundations totter!—Be yourſelf—Shall the ſoaring eagle ſwoop at reptiles, the prey of bats and owls?</p>
               <p>Do not mock me with impoſſible hopes—What! Have you not held the mirror up to me, and ſhewn me my own hatefulneſs?</p>
               <p>Are you a man? Will you never ſhake off this bondage? Oh it is baſe! it is beneath you! Of what have you been guilty? Why of ignorance, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0201200107:252"/>
of the underſtanding, falſe views, which you wanted knowledge enough, truth enough, to correct. Have not many of the godlike men whom we admire moſt been guilty, in their youth, of equal or of greater errors?—Thus, alas, it happens that minds of the higheſt hope, and moſt divine ſtamp and coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, are cut off daily; ſwept away by that other grand miſtake of mankind—<q>Exemplary puniſhment is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</q>—So they ſay—But no—'Tis exemplary reformation! Can the world be better warned by a body in gibbets, than by the active virtues of a once miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided but now enlightened under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? The gibbet will remain an object of terror to the traveller, who dreads being robbed and murdered;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0201200107:253"/>
but an incitement to deſpair, in the mind of the murderer!—Baniſh then theſe black pictures from your mind, by which it continues darkened and miſled; and in their ſtead behold a ſoul-inſpiring proſpect, of all that is great and glorious, riſing to your view! Feel yourſelf a man! Nay you ſhall feel it, in your own deſpite! A man capable of high and noble actions!</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <p>Here, Oliver, I at this time left him. His eye remained fixed, and he was ſilent; but its wildneſs was diminiſhed: the frown of his brow diſappeared, and his countenance became more clear. Such aſſociations as theſe tokens denoted ought not to meet interruption. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0201200107:254"/>
I took care to return in leſs than an hour; fearful leſt he ſhould decline into his former gloom, which was little ſhort of phrenſy. I had been fortunate enough to reduce his diſcordant feelings to ſomething like harmony; and the moment I entered his room the ſecond time he exclaimed—</p>
                  <p>You are a generous fellow! A mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous fellow! You can work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles!—I know you of old—Can bring the dead to life!—Can almoſt perſuade me that even I, by living, may now and then effect ſome trifling, pitiful good; may ſnatch ſome of the remnants, the offals of honour—But aught eminent, aught worthy of—</p>
                  <p>Be calm.</p>
                  <p>No! It cannot be forgotten, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given!—
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0201200107:255"/>
Cruel, malignant, remorſeleſs wretch!</p>
                  <p>Can you ſpeak thus of the preſent?—You know you cannot!—And wherefore unjuſtly inſiſt on the paſt? Be firm! Conquer this pride of heart!</p>
                  <p>Why, ay—Pride of heart!—It is the very damning ſin of my ſoul!</p>
                  <p>Exorciſe the foul fiend then, and in its ſtead give welcome to firm but unaſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſelf-reſpect. Ariſe! Shake torpor from you, and feel your ſtrength! It is Atlean; made to bear a world! Cheriſh life, and become worthy of yourſelf! What! Would you kill a mind ſo mighty? Do you not feel it, now; poſſeſſing you, emanating, flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, burſting to ſpread itſelf?</p>
                  <p>Why, that were ſomething!—Could
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0201200107:256"/>
I but once again get into my own good liking—! You are a ſtrange fellow!—You will not hate me! Nay, will not ſuffer me to hate myſelf!—Damnation! To be caſt at ſuch an immenſe diſtance! Oh it is intolerable! It is contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!—But I will have my revenge!—Some how or another I will yet have my revenge! And, ſince hate muſt not be the word, why—! But no matter—I will have no more vaunting—Yet, if I do not—! I have had a glimpſe, and begin to know you—The ſoul of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, of tenderneſs, of attention, of love, of all the divine faculties that make men deities, infuſes itſelf and pervades you—Had I but been wholly fool, I had been but partly villain—But I!—Oh
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0201200107:257"/>
monſtrous!—The fiends with whom I was leagued to me were angels!</p>
                  <p>Why, ay; contemplate the picture, but do not forget it is that of a man you once knew, who is now no more. He has diſappeared, and in his ſtead an angel of light is come!</p>
                  <p>Stop!—Go not too faſt!—I promiſe nothing—Mark that!—I promiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing—Do not imagine I am now in the feveriſh repentance of white wine whey—You would have me ſtay in a world which I myſelf have rendered hateful—I will think of it—I know your arts—You would realize the fable of Pygma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and would infuſe ſoul into marble!</p>
                  <p>There is no need; you have a ſoul already; inventive, capacious, munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſublime!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0201200107:258"/>
Ay, ay—I know—You have a choice collection of words.</p>
                  <p>A ſoul of ten thouſand! Nay, an army of ſouls in one!</p>
                  <p>And muſt I ſubmit? Are you deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to make a raſcal like me admire, and love, and give place to all the fine affections of the heart?</p>
                  <p>Ay, determined!</p>
                  <p>Oh, ſiſter!—(Louiſa at this moment entered.) To you too I have behaved like a ſcoundrel! A tyrant! A pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant, oſtentatious, imperious brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gart!</p>
                  <p>You miſtake! replied Louiſa, eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. You miſtake! You are talking of a very different man! A being I could not underſtand. You are my brother!
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0201200107:259"/>
—My brother!—I have found the way to your heart! Will make it all my own! Will twine myſelf round it! Shake me off if you can!</p>
                  <p>The energy with which ſhe ſpoke, and looked, and kiſſed him, was irreſiſtible! He was overpowered: the tears guſhed to his eyes, but he repreſſed them; he thought them unmanly; and, ſeeing his medical friend enter, exclaimed—I have ſurgeons for the body, and ſurgeons for the mind, who cut with ſo deep yet ſo ſteady a hand that they take away the noxious, and leave the ſound to ſuppurate and heal!</p>
                  <p>Can we do leſs? ſaid I. Ours is no common taſk! We are acting in behalf of ſociety: we have found a treaſure,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0201200107:260"/>
by which it is to be enriched. Few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are thoſe puiſſant and heavenly endowed ſpirits, that are capable of guiding, enlightening, and leading the human race onward to felicity! What is there precious but mind? And when mind, like a diamond of uncommon growth, exceeds a certain magnitude, calculation cannot find its value!</p>
                  <p>I once more left him; and never did I quit the company of human being, no not of Anna St. Ives herſelf, with a more glowing and hoping heart. But why deſcribe ſenſations to thee, Oliver, with which thou art ſo intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted? To bid thee rejoice, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite thee to participate in felicity, which may and muſt ſo widely diffuſe itſelf,
