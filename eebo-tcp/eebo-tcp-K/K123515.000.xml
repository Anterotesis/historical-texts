            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE,
To all that are concerned in the
EDUCATION of CHILDREN.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an awful and important
Charge that is committed
to you. The Wiſdom and
Welfare of the ſucceeding Generation
are intruſted with you beforehand, and
depend much on your Conduct. The
Seeds of Miſery or Happineſs in this
World, and that to come are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1013401100:4"/>
ſown very early; and therefore
whatever may conduce to give the
Minds of Children a Reliſh for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Religion, ought, in the firſt
Place, to be propoſed to you.</p>
            <p>VERSE was at firſt deſigned for the
Service of GOD, though it hath been
wretchedly abuſed ſince. The Ancients,
among the Jews and the Heathens,
taught their Children and Diſciples the
Precepts of Morality and Worſhip in
Verſe. The Children of Iſrael were
commanded to learn the Words of the
Song of Moſes, <hi>Deut. xxxi.</hi> 19, 30. and
we are directed in the New Teſtament,
not only to ſing <hi>with Grace in the Heart,</hi>
but to <hi>teach, and admoniſh one another
by Hymns and Songs,</hi> Ephes. v. 19. And
there are theſe four Advantages in it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1013401100:5"/>
I. THERE is a great Delight in the
very learning of Truths and Duties this
Way. There is ſomething ſo amuſing
and entertaining in Rhymes and Metre,
that will incline Children to make this
Part of their Buſineſs a Diverſion. And
you may turn their very Duty into a
Reward, by giving them the Privilege
of learning one of theſe SONGS every
Week, if they fulfil the Buſineſs of
the Week well, and promiſing them
the Book itſelf, when they have learnt
ten or twenty Songs out of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. WHAT is learnt in Verſe, is
longer retained in Memory, and ſooner
recollected. The like Sounds, and the
like Number of Syllables, exceedingly
aſſiſt the Remembrance. And it may
often happen, that the End of a Song
running in the Mind, may be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
means to keep off ſome Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1013401100:6"/>
or to incline to ſome Duty, when
a Word of Scripture is not upon their
Thoughts.</p>
            <p n="3">III. THIS will be a conſtant Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for the Minds of Children, that
they may have ſomething to think
upon when alone, and ſing over to
themſelves. This may ſometimes give
their Thoughts a divine Turn, and
raiſe a young Meditation. Thus they
will not be forced to ſeek Relief for an
Emptineſs of Mind, out of the looſe
and dangerous Sonnets of the Age.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THESE <hi>Divine Songs</hi> may be a
pleaſant and proper Matter for their
Daily or Weekly Worſhip, to ſing one
in the Family, at ſuch Time as the
Parents or Governors ſhall appoint;
and therefore I have confined the Verſe
to the moſt uſual Pſalm Tunes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1013401100:7"/>
THE greateſt part of this little Book
was compoſed ſeveral Years ago, at the
Requeſt of a Friend, who has been
long engaged in the Work of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing
a very great Number of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of all kinds, and with abundant
Skill and Succeſs. So that you will
find here nothing that ſavours of a
Party: The Children of high and low
Degree, of the Church of England, or
Diſſenters, baptiſed in Infancy, or not,
may all join together in theſe Songs.
And as I have endeavoured to ſink the
Language to the Level of a Child's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and yet to keep it, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
above Contempt; ſo I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to profit all, if poſſible, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
none. I hope the more general
the Senſe is, theſe Compoſures may be
of the more univerſal Uſe and Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:1013401100:8"/>
I HAVE added at the End, ſome
Attempts of SONNETS on MORAL
SUBJECTS, for Children, with an Air
of Pleaſantry, to provoke ſome fitter
Pen to write a little Book of them.</p>
            <p>MAY the Almighty GOD make you
faithful in this important Work of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
may he ſucceed your Cares
with his abundant Grace, that the
riſing Generation of Great Britain may
be a Glory among the Nations, a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
to the Chriſtian World, and a
Bleſſing to the Earth.</p>
