            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the Introduction to it he meant to have produced
ſome ſpecimens of the Style that reigned in ancient
times among the neighbouring nations, or thoſe
who had ſubdued the greater part of this Iſland,
and were our Progenitors: the following three
Imitations made a part of them. He has long

well qualified to do it juſtice, both by his taſte,

               <p>IN the Eleventh Century <hi>Sigurd,</hi> Earl of the
Orkney-Iſlands, went with a fleet of ſhips and a
conſiderable body of troops into Ireland, to the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>Sictryg with the ſilken beard,</hi> who was then
making war on his father-in-law <hi>Brian,</hi> King of
Dublin: the Earl and all his forces were cut to
pieces, and <hi>Sictryg</hi> was in danger of a total defeat;
but the enemy had a greater loſs by the death of
<hi>Brian,</hi> their King, who fell in the action. On
Chriſtmas-day, (the day of the battle,) a Native of
<hi>Gaithneſs</hi> in Scotland ſaw at a diſtance a number of
perſons on horſeback riding full ſpeed towards a hill,
<pb facs="tcp:0207700700:71"/>
and ſeeming to enter into it. Curioſity led him to
follow them, till looking through an opening in the
rocks he ſaw twelve gigantic figures reſembling wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
they were all employed about a loom; and as
they wove, they ſung the following dreadful Song;
which when they had finiſhed, they tore the web into
twelve pieces, and (each taking her portion) gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped
Six to the North and as many to the South.</p>
