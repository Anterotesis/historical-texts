            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all Circumſtances that affect the Mind of Man with Compaſſion,
<note place="margin">Reaſons for the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> no one ſeems to touch it ſo nearly as the ſeeing our Fellow-Creatures labouring with Diſeaſes, and even periſhing under them for want of proper and timely Aſſiſtance; for who that is not ſavage in Nature can paſs regardleſs by thoſe Numbers of miſerable Objects, who daily preſent themſelves to us, and whoſe various Diſeaſes (were all other Motives ſilent) would be as ſo many Tongues, which at once ſpeak their own Anguiſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our Pity. As the Characteriſtick of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> is to be humane and beneficent, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1150000400:3"/>ſhews it more than Inſtitutions of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Nature, ſuch as Hoſpitals and Infirmaries, which are here better regulated and ſupplied with Neceſſaries, than in any other Country what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Some there are of Royal Endowment, and eſtabliſh'd Revenue, and others of more modern Inſtitution, erected and ſupported by the generous and voluntary Contributions of good and well-diſpoſed Perſons; but all theſe are by Experience known to be no ways ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the Numbers that ſeek Aſſiſtance from them; for as they can take in no more Patients than they have Beds, or give Medicine to more than what their Income will allow, many poor unhappy Creatures muſt be unavoidably loſt. For 'tis a Truth well known, that tho' the City of <hi>London</hi> is more populous, and by its Trade and Navigation, the labouring Part thereof are more ſubject to Accidents and Diſeaſes than the common People of <hi>Paris;</hi> yet it appears from the annual printed Accounts, that the <hi>Hotel Dieu</hi> alone contains more Patients at one time than all our Hoſpitals and Infirmaries together. If ſuch Proviſion is made for the diſeaſed Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Paris,</hi> thoſe of <hi>London</hi> more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately require our Regard; particularly, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufacturers and Seamen, as they are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1150000400:4"/>the chief Support of both our foreign and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Trade.</p>
            <p>The Strength and Security of <hi>Great Britain</hi> depending chiefly on its Naval Power, the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Legiſlature has ſhewed a peculiar Concern for the Comfort and Happineſs of ſuch infirm and diſabled Seamen as have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Service of the Royal Navy: But for Seamen imployed only in the Service of the Merchant, and trading Part of the Kingdom, or the Wives and Families of ſuch, in Diſtreſs by Sickneſs, no deſirable Publick Proviſion has yet been made, or <hi>particularly</hi> inſtituted for their Relief. Nor are our numerous, poor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Manufacturers, and Artificers, or their Wives and Children, by any particular Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Eſtabliſhment, ſufficiently provided for, under the Calamity of bodily Diſeaſes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties; tho' in ſuch afflicting and melancholy Circumſtances, they are incapable of providing for themſelves or Families by their uſual Labour and Induſtry.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations have induced many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent and publick ſpirited Noblemen, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Merchants and others to turn their Thoughts upon raiſing by publick Subſcription, a LONDON-INFIRMARY, where <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sailors in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1150000400:5"/>the Merchants Service, their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and poor <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufacturers, their Wives and Children; are daily admitted, and find Relief, in Diſtreſs by Sickneſs or Caſualties: And this without any Difficulty or Expence of Admittance.</p>
            <p>In order to anſwer the Ends propoſed,
<note place="margin">Situation.</note> 
               <hi>a large Houſe was taken in</hi> Preſcot-Street, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's-Fields, which Situation was judged the moſt convenient, as being near the uſual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodes of Manufacturers and Seafaring Men in the Merchants Service, and at a conſiderable Diſtance from any Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>The Houſe is ſpacious and convenient,
<note place="margin">Regulation of the Houſe.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about forty Beds, properly and airily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is furniſhed with Linnen, and all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conveniencies. The <hi>Matron,</hi> a ſober and diſcreet Woman, has the Charge of the Houſe and Furniture; the Direction of the Nurſes, and other Servants; and ſees the Diet and Medicines adminiſtred according to Order. Under her, are Nurſes, and Watchers, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Number of Patients, of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Honeſty and Tenderneſs, who are guided by written Orders to prevent Miſconduct of any kind. Proper Diet for the Patients has been ſettled by the Gentlemen of the Faculty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1150000400:6"/>engaged in this Charity, and is fixed up in the Wards for the Satisfaction of the Patients and their Friends.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Phyſician and Surgeon</hi> of Reputation are appointed, and attend daily,
<note place="margin">Phyſicians and Surgeons.</note> from Eleven to One, without any Fee or Reward, and give their Advice to all ſuch poor diſeaſed Objects as think proper to come in thoſe Hours, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recommended or not; and other Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Surgeons of Character attend and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe in all dangerous or extraordinary Caſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diſpenſary</hi> is furniſh'd with Drugs,
<note place="margin">Diſpenſary.</note> which being firſt viewed and reported Good by a Committee for that Purpoſe, are bought at the beſt hand, and compounded at the <hi>Infirmary,</hi> where an Apothecary Reſides, who conſtantly and ſolely attends the Buſineſs thereof.</p>
            <p>No Officers or Servants are permitted upon Pain of Expulſion to take of any Tradeſmen, Patients, or other Perſons, any Fee, Reward, or Gratification of any kind, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, for any Service done, or to be done, on Account of this Infirmary.</p>
            <p>And as the Governors of this Charity are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that the utmoſt Regard may be had to the Souls of the Patients,
<note place="margin">Chaplain.</note> as well as their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England</hi> has generouſly undertaken, without any Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1150000400:7"/>to read Prayers, and perform the other Duties of his Function, at the <hi>Infirmary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every Subſcriber of five Guineas Yearly is a Governor of this Charity,
<note place="margin">Qualification of a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</note> and is intitled to ſend in as many Patients as there are Vacancies of Beds; but if they can't be received as In-Patients, they are relieved as Out-Patients. Every Gentleman giving a Benefaction of thirty Guineas at once, will be a Governor for Life.—All Subſcriptions are during Pleaſure, and ſmaller Sums, from well-diſpoſed Perſons, will be thankfully receiv'd and acknowledg'd.</p>
            <p>Four Governors in Rotation every Month,
<note place="margin">Buſineſs of Governors.</note> with any others that are pleaſed, attend Weekly, in order to receive, and diſmiſs Patients, ſuperviſe the Proceeding of the Houſe, and do ſuch Buſineſs as is uſually done by Committees at other Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, and report the ſame at the next Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly or General Meeting. There is a General Meeting of the Governors every Quarter, before whom a Report is made from the Weekly Committees, all By-Laws are then Confirm'd, all Vacancies fill'd up, and Accounts Audited. Alſo an Annual General Meeting of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers to Reviſe and Confirm the General Account of Proceedings, which will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after be publiſh'd for the Satisfaction of the Publick.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1150000400:8"/>
            <p>The Accounts are kept in a regular mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Manner, and the Names of the Patients, their Employment, Place of Abode, Diſorder, the Iſſue of the Caſe, and the Name of the Subſcriber who ſent them, are inſerted in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Columns in a Book for that Purpoſe; and are always ready for the Inſpection of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, as alſo the Statutes and By-Laws for the particular Regulation of this <hi>Infirmary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All poor, ſick, and lame,
<note place="margin">Proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> who are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, or appear to the Committee to be truly neceſſitous, are received from the Hours of Eleven to One, who are ſupply'd with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Medicine, Diet, Waſhing, Lodging, and every comfortable Aſſiſtance during their Cure. No Perſons with incurable or infectious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, or of known Ability to pay for their Cures, are admitted to partake of this Charity; but all Accidents are received at any Hour of the Day or Night.</p>
            <p>This is the Plan of our Proceedings, and tho' this Work is but in its Infancy, yet ſuch has been the extraordinary Encouragement given to it, by Numbers of Diſtinguiſh'd Humanity, that we have the Satisfaction to aſſure the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that ſince the 3d of <hi>November,</hi> 1740, it has pleaſed God to bleſs us with ſuch Succeſs, that upwards of 2000 diſtreſſed Objects have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1150000400:9"/>been Relieved at the <hi>London Infirmary,</hi> and from Labouring under the Oppreſſion of ſome of the moſt malignant Diſeaſes, and unhappy Accidents, have been re-inſtated in their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and Induſtrious Capacities of Working; whereby the Publick again enjoy the Benefit of their Labour; They, and their poor Families preſerved from Periſhing, and prevented from being a conſtant Incumbrance to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>The Subſcribers are deſired to take Notice, that if any Patients ſhall not conform to the Rules of the Houſe, or are guilty of any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour, they will be diſcharged for ſuch Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity, and never more relieved by this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>There was a Propoſal in the <hi>Daily Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſer</hi> of the 17th of <hi>May,</hi> 1738, for erecting an <hi>Hoſpital, Infirmary, Surgery, Chappel,</hi> and <hi>School,</hi> for relieving of poor, aged, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſabled Seamen in the Merchants Service, their Wives and Children, by a Subſcription to be ſet on Foot amongſt the Merchants, Owners, Maſters, and Officers of Ships, and common Seamen, who were to pay certain Quarterly Sums according to their ſeveral Ranks, which, with the Contributions of worthy People, might have been ſufficient for the deſired End: As
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1150000400:10"/>the <hi>London Infirmary</hi> already begun, is calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to relieve all thoſe who are diſabled by Sickneſs or Accidents, and their Wives and Children, and anſwers that Propoſal in Part, and may be the Foundation of the Whole, we hope thoſe who had ſo charitably join'd in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that Subſcription, will as readily intereſt themſelves in this, which, if it pleaſes God to continue his Favour and proſper the Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may in time, by ſuch Encouragement, be extended to the whole Benefit propoſed by that Advertiſement.</p>
            <p rend="italic">Such Perſons therefore as are inclined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and promote ſo laudable a Work, are deſired to ſend their Subſcriptions or Benefactions to Mr. <hi>Thomas Minors,</hi> Banker, in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> who will give proper Receipts for the ſame: And any Perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined by his laſt Will to bequeath a Legacy to this Charity, is deſired to direct it to be paid to the Treaſurer for the Time being, of the <hi>London Infirmary</hi> in <hi>Goodman's Fields,</hi> and that his Receipt ſhall be a good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge for the ſame.</p>
