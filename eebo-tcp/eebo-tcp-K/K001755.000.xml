            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE are two very different methods of curing the Gonorrhoea, the one wholly by internal medicines, the other principally by injection. The former is generally a very uncertain and diſagreeable proceſs, the latter is both expeditious and ſafe, but dreaded by many perſons on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a falſe idea which has long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. This ill founded notion it is my buſineſs at preſent to confute by ſeveral arguments ſupported by quotations from Authors of diſtinguiſhed credit.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pott</hi> recommends the advice given by Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> to a ſtudent, "to conſider one diſeaſe at a time, and to become tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly acquainted with that, before he
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0167500200:3"/>undertakes another." He further obſerves, "that the only means by which true and uſeful knowledge is to be obtained in every part of ſurgery, are a competent knowledge of the anatomical ſtructure of the human frame, a cloſe attention to the ſymptoms of diſeaſes in the living, and a minute examination of the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in the dead: theſe are the great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of all medical knowledge." Mr. <hi>Pott</hi> has here pointed out, in a very judicious manner, the path which every chirurgical practitioner and writer ſhould purſue, who undertakes to explain the true nature, ſeat, and cure of any bodily diſorder.</p>

            <head>A TREATISE ON THE GONORRHOEA.</head>
            <p>THE part principally affected by the Gonorrhoea is the penis, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of three parts; two of which are called corpora cavernoſa, and lie on each ſide, and a third, which is ſituated underneath, named corpus ſpongioſum urethrae, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the bulb and membranous part, continued on to the bladder, and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the other extremity in the corona, or glans penis. The urethra has three glands, which were diſcovered by <hi>Cowper,</hi> and called mucous glands, from the tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the liquor which they ſeparate. There are alſo two, (or rather one,) about the ſize of a nutmeg, they lie at the neck
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0167500200:6"/>of the bladder, between the veſiculae ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales and penis, under the oſſa pubis, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt within the pelvis of the abdomen; they ſeparate a limpid glutinous humour, which is carried into the urethra by ſeveral ducts, which enter near thoſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatae The two firſt of <hi>Cowper</hi>'s glands are about the bigneſs of a French bean, of a depreſſed oval figure, and a yellowiſh colour like the proſtatae, being on each ſide the bulb of the urethra, a little above it. Their excretory ducts ariſe from the internal ſurface next the inner membrane of the urethra, into which they open a little lower by two diſtinct orifices, juſt below the curvature of the oſſa pubis in perinaeo, where they diſcharge a tranſparent viſcous liquor. The third mucous gland is a ſmall conglobate yellowiſh gland, like the former, but ſomewhat leſs, ſituated above the angle of the flexure of the urethra, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the oſſa pubis, in the perinaeum, near the anus: it has two excretory ducts, which enter the urethra obliquely, a quarter of an inch below the two former, and diſcharges a liquor like them both in colour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
            <p>The ſeat of the Gonorrhoea in women is the vagina, which is affected with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0167500200:7"/>charge like that of the urethra in men. It lies between the bladder and inteſtinum rectum, and has rugae, under which are ſmall glands, whoſe excretory ducts are called lacunae. Theſe glands ſeparate a mucilaginous ſlimy liquor to lubricate the vagina, and are the ſeat of the Gonorrhoea in this ſex, as the glands in the urethra are in the male. The meatus urinarius being a very ſhort paſſage, the heat and ſcalding is conſequently much leſs than in the men.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"A Gonorrhoea from the urethra in a man, begins with an uneaſineſs about the parts of generation, together with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a little whitiſh matter, about the orifice of the urethra, a little ſwelling and ſometimes redneſs there, and a ſlight pungency upon the evacuation of urine. The whitiſh matter ſoon increaſes in quantity, the inflammation about the end of the urethra becomes more evident, and for the moſt part there is now a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and hardneſs through the whole of it, a ſwelling of the lacunae, and a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſtricture in the penis, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on erection. The matter ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, flows out, and grows thinner, loſes all its adheſiveneſs, and is of a yellow, or greeniſh colour. There is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0167500200:8"/>now always a redneſs about the end of the canal; often a pain from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the urethra, during the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of urine, and a much ſeverer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the orifice, from its ſtimulus, with an increaſe of the redneſs juſt after it is evacuated. The inflammation prevents the extenſion of the urethra in erection, ſo that the penis is at that time curved downwards with great pain, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed if it be raiſed towards the belly, and the ſtimulus occaſions it often to be erected, eſpecially when warm in bed<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Fordyce</hi>'s Elements of Phyſic.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I believe it would generally be eſteemed good practice on this occaſion to give nitre in conſiderable quantity, a purging elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, pill, or ſalts, and to take blood freely from the patient; alſo to direct large quantities of diluting liquors, and further to recommend a ſtrict regimen and abſtinence from particular meats, vegetables, and ſtrong liquors. The queſtion is, are ſuch medicines and reſtriction neceſſary? In my humble opinion they are not, and they appear, upon the whole, to do more harm than good, as I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate from the experience of thoſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0167500200:9"/>who are well qualified to give an opinion in a matter of this kind, and alſo from my own obſervation and practice.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Cullen</hi> remarks, "that purgatives not only inflame the rectum, but alſo extend their irritation to the urethra." May not chordee and priapiſm then often be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to this cauſe?</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Fordyce</hi> recommends "increaſing the ſecretion a little, by ſuch gentle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives as procure only two or three evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations a day."—But who can enſure his patient two or three ſtools only in a day? The inteſtines being once put into motion, will not accommodate themſelves exactly to our wiſh or convenience. Happily for the patient, it is certain that even gentle purging may be diſpenſed with on theſe occaſions.</p>
            <p>He adds, "that ſevere purging often augments the inflammatory ſymptoms, brings on ſtrangury and exulcerations, gives occaſion to inflammation of the teſticles, and other neighbouring parts, or it ſtops the running before the infection is waſhed off, and the Gonorrhoea either returns in a few days, or exulcerations take place."</p>
            <p>The Doctor further obſerves, "that long continued purging is apt to weaken the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0167500200:10"/>ſtomach and inteſtines, to hurt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, to produce obſtinate gleets, and leave hypochondriacal ſymptoms, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in irritable or melancholic habits."</p>
            <p>Many more authorities might be adduced in proof of the bad effects of a courſe of purgatives in theſe caſes, which are generally of conſiderable duration, when treated in this manner. Neither are anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlogiſtic remedies to be depended upon, as they ſometimes produce the very contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect to what was expected from them: amongſt the firſt of theſe is nitre, in inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diſorders. Dr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> a late writer of no ſmall credit, reckons, that nitre often gives relief in ſtranguries, and heat of urine, proceeding either from a ſimple or a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real taint; and indeed the greateſt part of practitioners have always given it, and ſtill continue to give it in the venereal <hi>ardor urinae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>"This practice, however, ſays Dr. <hi>Hope</hi> in his lectures on the Materia medica, I am apt to believe has taken its riſe from the name of ardor having always been given to the pain in evacuating the urine, during the time of a venereal inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the urethra, and the name and virtues of a cooler, having always been
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0167500200:11"/>attributed to this ſalt. But it is certain that the urine paſſed during the time of a venereal inflammation is no warmer than at other times, and therefore to preſcribe a cooler to allay the heat of it, is abſurd: and I am perſuaded, that on a free and candid examination of this matter, it will be found, that nitre has not the ſmalleſt power of alleviating the pain which is then felt; for I have given it in all the different ſtages of this diſeaſe, in ſmall and in large doſes; but from the ſole uſe of it in a great number of trials, have never been able to obſerve that it afforded the leaſt relief. Nor, when we conſider the cauſe of that pain, and the effects of nitre, have we any reaſon to expect it; for the pain certainly proceeds from the acrid ſalts in the urine, ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the inflamed or excoriated urethra; and a ſolution of nitre applied to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriated part always gives conſiderable pain. Experiments aſſure us, that on taking nitre into the ſtomach, the urine becomes impregnated with it. The larger therefore the doſes are, the ſtronger will this impregnation be, and the greater ſtimulus added to the urine; ſo that we may ſenſibly conclude, that this ſalt will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0167500200:12"/>rather augment than diminiſh the pain in evacuating it. The Doctor further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, that there are many weak and delicate ſtomachs which cannot bear the cold it produces, and others in whom it always creates ſickneſs and nauſea."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the diſagreeable circumſtance of taking great quantities of nauſeous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, we find there is the greateſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty as to their real effects on the diſeaſes they are intended to remove. A powder or medicine of any kind, applied to blood in a baſon, may viſibly affect that fluid, and render it thin or thick; yet being taken into the ſtomach, and poſſibly from thence into the circulation, it may have a very different effect on the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fluids, or perhaps none, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone a material alteration in its courſe.</p>
            <p>A late celebrated Lecturer on the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Medica, diſcourſing with his pupils on the powerful operations of mucilaginous medicines in the alleviation of the pain ariſing from the ſtone in the bladder, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked that ſuch medicines were extremely uſeful where the ſtone was of the mulberry kind, and apt to vellicate the coats of the bladder. He told them the ropy mucilage
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0167500200:13"/>would envelope the ſtone, and make a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly ſmooth ſurface, entirely depriving it of its aſperities, and conſequently of its power of hurting the bladder.</p>
            <p>It is difficult for one converſant with the mechaniſm of the human body, and the operation of medicine, to conceive, that a mucilage given by the mouth will arrive at the bladder in that ſtate. We are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that particular remedies will ſtimulate particular parts: balſam of capivi, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, being abſorbed, is known to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the kidnies and bladder, by the ſtrong odour it imparts to the urine; but we do not find this, or any other medicine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept quickſilver, will paſs off in the ſame form in which it is adminiſtered by the mouth. This balſam is very much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for its great virtues, particularly in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtages of the Gonorrhoea, but it is ſo very diſagreeable, on account of its oily and bitter quality, as well as its ſmell, that ſome patients are ſoon diſguſted with it, and others will not be prevailed upon to take it at all; we cannot therefore think it ſtrange, that many gentlemen ſhould often prefer injections to all other means, which do not appear to produce effects in any degree equal to the trouble which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0167500200:14"/>them. It muſt be acknowledged that patients often ſuffer more from the remedy than the diſorder; they are often more emaciated, weak, and pallid in their countenance, (circumſtances which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently lead to diſagreeable diſcoveries,) from the operations of purgatives in the ſpace of one week, than they would have been in a month, if there had been no attempt made to check the progreſs of this diſorder.</p>
            <p>There are many people who have not leiſure to purſue the ſeveral directions and preſcriptions given by practitioners; and if they could find time, they would have but little inclination to undergo ſo much fatigue and trouble. Such tedious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes are very ill contrived for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, who muſt be, <hi>and are daily cured by means much more eaſy, expeditious, and quite as effectual;</hi> and if one claſs of men are cured in this manner, why ſhould not all enjoy the ſame benefit?</p>
            <p>I have aſſerted, that a regimen, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diet, is not neceſſary in the cure of the Gonorrhoea, when treated in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner here recommended. Some have aſked, if the diſorder is not inflammatory, and if living low is not indiſpenſibly neceſſary
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0167500200:15"/>in every complaint of this kind? It may be ſaid in reply, that this is a local inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which yields at once to a cooling detergent liquid applied to the part; whilſt internal medicines are commonly ſlow and uncertain in removing it.—When mercury does not paſs into the ſtomach, there is no occaſion to enjoin reſtrictions with reſpect to diet, ſince no diſagreement can then happen; patients may live in the ſame manner as at other times, only avoiding exceſs.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Hugh Smith,</hi> who is an advocate for vitriolic injections, aſſerts, "That a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhoea, if taken in the beginning, may generally be cured in a fortnight, without any injuty to the conſtitution, or any ill effects whatſoever<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Formulae Medicamentorum.</note>."</p>
            <p>I have met with the greateſt ſucceſs in the cure of this complaint from the ſame ſort of injections, and find they anſwer much better than mercurial ones, which depoſit a conſiderable ſediment, and being conveyed into the urethra, cauſe irritation and pain in that tender paſſage.</p>
            <p>The injection ſhould be applied cold, rather than warm, (as cold braces and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0167500200:16"/>warmth relaxes,) which I find often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletes the cure in much leſs than a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, the time mentioned by the Doctor.</p>
            <p>If the injection cauſes any more than a ſlight ſenſation of ſmart or pain in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, it is evidently too much impregnated with vitriol, and the ſolution muſt be made weaker, as the irritation of the liquor would increaſe the ſymptoms inſtead of diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
            <p>The great objection to this ſort of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is raiſed on the ſuppoſition that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> are apt to produce <hi>ſtricture</hi> in the urinary paſſage, This idea, I apprehend, is not well founded; having enquired of many different people who have been troubled with <hi>ſtrictures,</hi> if they had uſed injections for the cure, and was generally anſwered in the negative.—I am much inclined to think with Doctor <hi>Fordyce,</hi> "That when a <hi>gonorrhoea</hi> continues long, it ſometimes produces a <hi>ſtricture</hi> in the part." Inflammation is naturally diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to produce contraction and <hi>ſtricture</hi> in the different ſacculi and paſſages of the body, as well as in the <hi>urethra:</hi> therefore we may conclude, that evils are often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to <hi>Injections,</hi> which in fact owe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0167500200:17"/>their origin to other cauſes<note n="*" place="bottom">If the long duration of this diſtemper produces ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and obſtructions, then what removes the diſorder quickly, muſt undoubtedly prevent the above evils, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of cauſing them.</note>. The ſame gentleman juſtly obſerves, that omitting the <hi>injection</hi> once or twice will often make it fail of curing, when it would have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe produced that effect<note n="†" place="bottom">If the Injection ſhould not produce the deſired ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it will be right to enquire if the urine paſſes freely, and whether it divides into two ſtreams, or more; or whether it comes out twiſted, like a cork-ſcrew. In theſe caſes, it is not likely the Injection ſhould effect its purpoſe, being unable to paſs: recourſe muſt therefore be had to the <hi>Bougie</hi> to reſtore the paſſage to its natural ſtate.</note>. He likewiſe remarks, that patients treated in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, are leſs liable to inflammation of the teſticles, or of the glands in the groin (on to <hi>chancres</hi>) or <hi>ſtrictures.</hi> Theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are certainly founded on fact. It is the general opinion, that ſmall doſes of mercury ought to accompany the <hi>Injection.</hi> See <hi>Fordyce, Saunders, Smith,</hi> and others.—Conformably to this idea, I give a grain of mercurial powder, and apply it to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſurfaces of the lips, or the tongue, and at the ſame time make uſe of the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolic,</hi> in preference to every other <hi>Injection.</hi> Though I have made repeated trials of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0167500200:18"/>I know of no other which would remove the diſorder in twice the time which this does; but there are ſome that would not ſucceed at all, and rather aggravate the ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>It is now proved by a repetition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious experiments, and generally admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the diſcharge in a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the <hi>wethra,</hi> is not <hi>pus,</hi> but <hi>mucus. Pus</hi> is the matter which proceeds from wounds and ulcers, but <hi>mucus</hi> comes from ſurfaces not ulcerated, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inflamed. Dr. <hi>Hunter</hi> ſays, he has often diſſected the <hi>urethra</hi> of perſons who have died, having the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> at that time, and he adds, that he never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered any ulcer in the paſſage. <hi>Mucus</hi> is, in itſelf, an innocent, mild fluid, but ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of acquiring virulence and acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from contagious infection.</p>
            <p>The Gonorrhoea is an increaſed and virulent diſcharge from the <hi>mucous</hi> glands<note n="*" place="bottom">Deſcribed in Pages 1 and 2.</note> of the urinary paſſage. Mucus, when untainted, is tranſparent like the white of an egg, appears as a drop ſometimes at the orifice of the urethra next the glands, is of a mucilaginous viſcidity, and its uſe is to ſheathe and defend the paſſage
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0167500200:19"/>from the irritating ſalts conveyed in the urine. It reſembles the fluid in the eye, which is ſecreted in ſmall quantity, but when the lachrymal gland is ſtimulated by grief, duſt, or other offending ſubſtance, the diſcharge becomes copious and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times acrid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darwin</hi> obſerves, in his experiments on pus and mucus, "That whenever the ſecretion of any fluid is increaſed, there is at the ſame time an increaſed heat in the part." The ſame gentleman obſerves, that "the catarrhal humour from the noſtrils of ſome who ride in froſty weather, and the tears which run down the cheeks of thoſe who have an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the puncta lachrymalia, are eaſily diſtinguiſhed from others, by their abounding in ammoniacal or muriatic ſalts, whence they inflame the circumjacent ſkin: thus in the catarrh, the upper lip becomes red and ſwelled from the acrimony of the mucus, and patients complain of the ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its taſte. The eyes and cheeks are red with the corroſive tears, and the ichor of ſome herpetic eruptions erodes far and wide the contiguous parts, and is pungent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſalt to the taſte, as ſome patients have informed him."</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0167500200:20"/>
            <p>When the mucous membrane of the noſe is ſtimulated by a violent cold, or other cauſe, we often ſee an extraordinary quantity of diſcharge from that organ; yet no one ſuſpects the exiſtence of any ulcers there, and I have often obſerved, that the diſcoloured mucus of that part bears ſo ſtrong a reſemblance to the viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſcharge in the gonorrhoea, that it would frequently perplex perſons conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in theſe matters to diſtinguiſh two handkerchiefs, the one from the other, when ſtained with the reſpective mucus. Either of theſe fluids having acquired acrimony will inflame, and ſometimes ſlightly exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riate irritable nervous membranes. Theſe excoriations generally heal of themſelves, and when they do not, no one heſitates to apply repellent and healing medicines to the part, without even the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion of any bad conſequence. With ulcers the caſe is very different, there being the greateſt reaſon to apprehend danger from the abſorption of matter into the circulation. Writers of good credit aſſert, that a drop of acrid pus, abſorbed into the blood, affects all the fluids, ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the veſſels, and is capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing violent diſorders, ſuch as putrid fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0167500200:21"/>&amp;c. Impreſſed with ſuch a belief, no thinking man, in this or any age, would adopt a practice at once ſo irrational and dangerous: but as the diſcharge is merely mucus, and has no concern with the ſyſtem or animal oeconomy, it may be ſafely waſhed away, like any other <hi>ſordes,</hi> or filth from the ſurfaces of the body, by injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are not only far more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in producing their effects, but alſo appear, on a due compariſon of the merits of each, to poſſeſs another advantage, that of being a more cleanly, ſafe, and agreeable method of cure, than any other whatſoever. I have only to add in this place, that I am confirmed more and more in the uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which entirely anſwer the above deſcription and commendation.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE REMEDIES in USE for the CURE OF THE LUES VENEREA, FROM ITS Firſt Appearance in EUROPE.</head>
            <p>THE cure of this diſorder, which has now prevailed all over <hi>Europe</hi> near three centuries, has not been ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the profeſſion as might have been expected during ſo long a period. It raged for ſeveral years uncontrouled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an effectual remedy for it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. After the antidote for this poiſon was found to exiſt in mercury, yet ſtill ſo very unfortunate was the applicat on of it, that many lives were loſt by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livations, ſhocking to relate, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0167500200:23"/>of the want of ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the nature and qualities of this mineral, in the practitioners of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>"The firſt attempts of the cure of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real maladies, by this remedy, were learned from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who having recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended mercurial ointments in the <hi>Leproſy</hi> or ſcabies, gave a handle to the <hi>Italian</hi> phyſicians, to try their efficacy in removing the foulneſs of the ſkin from a new and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible contagion: neither were they ſparing of their liniments, which they continued to rub in for twelve, fifteen, nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for above thirty days together<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mead</hi> on Poiſons.</note>," a very dangerous practice, which prevails too much even in the preſent age. Sarſaparilla, ſaſſafras, guaicum, have all at different pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods been in more or leſs eſtimation for their antivenereal virtues; but mercury is the only antidote for this poiſon, on which any age has repoſed an entire confidence.</p>
            <p>In 1685, Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> wrote on this amongſt other ſubjects. His account ſhews, that although the uſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy was better underſtood, yet the cure of the diſorder was but little improved.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0167500200:24"/>
            <p>In 1731, Dr. <hi>Turner,</hi> a member of the College of Phyſicians in <hi>London,</hi> who had made the Venereal Diſeaſe his particular ſtudy, thought proper to communicate his obſervations and practice to the world. His draſtic purges, and mercurial preſcriptions, were ſuch as might deſtroy the moſt robuſt conſtitution; what then muſt have become of thoſe of a weak and delicate frame?</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Boerhaave</hi> has advanced a ſyſtem of his own, apparently leſs detrimental than former ones, and which has been very much adopted of late years. The Doctor's theory of the diſeaſe is, that it is ſeated in the fat; therefore evacuations which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed it, muſt, in his opinion, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute greatly to the cure of this diſorder; for which reaſon the Doctor recommended the moſt powerful ſudorifics and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the former of which though hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, are leſs prejudicial to the conſtitution than the latter.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Aſtruc,</hi> a celebrated writer, has given a very ſenſible and accurate deſcription of the <hi>Lues Venerea</hi> in all its ſtages, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for its cure; but the remedies are as violent as thoſe recommended by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding writers, and ought therefore to be exploded.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0167500200:25"/>
            <p>Baron <hi>Van Swieten</hi> recommends <hi>The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Sublimate</hi> to be given internally. It had hitherto only been uſed externally to <hi>fungus</hi> in wounds, on account of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of its nature. Even when admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered in rum or brandy, to correct it, the ſtomach can ſeldom retain it, for which reaſon it has grown into diſrepute, although it has a moſt aſtoniſhing and rapid effect in removing venereal ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>Mr. Profeſſor <hi>Plenk</hi> adviſes the giving <hi>Quickſilver with gum arabic,</hi> to prevent it from exciting a ſalivation. This is the leaſt prejudicial of all the modes of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering mercury internally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fumigation,</hi> which is lately revived, I have often ſeen applied to ſores with hardly any perceptible advantage, and ſometimes it gave great pain, and did a manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
            <p>Two circumſtances have conduced great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the better treatment of this complaint, within theſe twenty or thirty years; I mean, the extraordinary improvements in anatomy and chymiſtry: by the former we have acquired a better knowledge of the ſeat of this diſorder, and by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the medicines employed to effect it's cure.</p>

            <head>A CRITICAL ENQUIRY INTO THE OPERATION OF MERCURY, AND THE DIFFERENT Modes of adminiſtering it conſidered.</head>
            <p>DIFFERENCE of opinion prevails with regard to the mode of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering mercurial preparations; the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for each, giving their reaſons for that which they adopt in preference to any other. The <hi>alterative</hi> method is much in eſteem and practice, and with ſome devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and caution may be rendered very beneficial.</p>
            <p>This appellation of <hi>alterant or alterative is given to all ſuch medicines as correct the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0167500200:27"/>bad qualities of the blood, and other animal fluids, without occaſioning any ſenſible evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi> According to Dr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> all that is commonly alledged concerning the change of principles or ferments of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes by alterant remedies, is merely chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical and imaginary; he remarks, that there is no change made to the advantage of the human body without a ſucceſſive renovation and diſcharge of what is hurtful, and a ſupply of its place by ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
            <p>The Doctor gives the preference to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuants, as being the only medicines ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of freeing the machine from whatever incommodes it. Some take a contrary courſe, and aſcribe even the ſalutary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of evacuants to their alterative nature, which has been alledged of mercury in the cure of the venereal diſeaſe. Among alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant medicines there are ſeveral which change the ſcene of the ſymptoms, and others which ſuſpend the action of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific matter for a time; but theſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which hold the morbific principles captive pro tempo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, are only palliatives, and even on ſome accounts dangerous, ſince they may as well captivate other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples neceſſary to liſe.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0167500200:28"/>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Fordyce</hi> ſays, "Whatever prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we employ, we ſhould give it in ſuch a manner, and in ſuch a doſe as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hardneſs, fullneſs, and moderate fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of the pulſe, with as little ſenſible evacuation as poſſible; for that the mercury cures ſooner and with greater certainty, when the ſtrength is but little, than when it is much reduced by it."</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Plenck</hi> is of opinion, "that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, together with the venereal virus, may be more conveniently and more eaſily evacuated by the ordinary excretions of ſweat, ſtool, and urine."</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me much more ſafe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the gradual evacuation of mercury (after it has circulated ſome time, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the virus) than to confine it within the body by opiates, or other means, ſo as to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hardneſs, fullneſs, and acceleration of the pulſe. The ſaturation or ſurcharge of the ſyſtem with mercury is very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous, as it ſometimes terminates in a fatal diarrhaea. Surely it is moſt prudent to permit a little of the mercury to depart, and throw into the circulation ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion only, as may be altogether ſafe and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0167500200:29"/>yet ſufficient to keep up a gentle mercurial ſtimulus in the habit.</p>
            <p>Mercury and wine operate ſomewhat alike upon the body. With a certain quantity of wine, hardneſs, fullneſs, and acceleration of the pulſe will ſupervene, till at length in common an evacuation takes place; when it does not, and the wine is retained there, (like mercury ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited as an alterative), it excites feveriſh heat, and does the conſtitution much more injury than when it paſſes off gradually by any of the ordinary evacuations.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Fordyce</hi> obſerves, "it is never ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalivate a patient, unleſs he be ſo irritable, that the ſmalleſt doſe of mercury immediately affects his mouth, or unleſs the diſeaſe be proceeding ſo faſt that it would be hazardous to wait till it was checked by the remedy given in ſuch a manner as to avoid ſalivation; or except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when we cannot truſt to his uſing it regularly. On the contrary, ſalivation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the effects of the medicine uncertain." The ſame author ſays, "If, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe precautions, a ſalivation ſhould come on, we know of no remedy which will remove it with any degree of certainty,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0167500200:30"/>although ſulphur, camphire, and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have been recommended for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If therefore the caſe be urgent, the beſt way is to let it go on, uſing the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial ointment as above deſcribed."<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Saunders</hi> ſays he has known patients who have had violent fevers excited by mercury in the form of unction.
<p>The ſame author remarks, that a gentleman who had recourſe to mercurial unction, being ſeized with a fever, ſent for him, and communicated to him his venercal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. His pulſe was quick and hard, he complained of pain in his back, headach, thirſt, and other ſuch ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms as he had frequently ſeen ariſe from a mercurial courſe, conducted on the plan here preſcribed."</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Cullen</hi> obſerves,—that purging is never excited by any means, without ſpaſms of the inteſtines, which, when the operation is continued, are apt to end in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſpaſm and inflammation. Theſe are attended with very dangerous conſequences. Neither does the method of purging by unction anſwer much better (although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more effectual), becauſe it is attended with very great pain.—<hi>Lectures on Materia medica.</hi>

            <p>I have ever found thoſe patients more eaſily cured, who were moſt ſuſceptible of the mercurial ſtimulus. Let there be an affection of the mouth and cheeks, and an amendment of the complaint takes place at leaſt nine times in ten; the mercury will run off in general very ſoon if the proceſs is diſcontinued, which it muſt not be, but the tenderneſs of the mouth is to be kept
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0167500200:31"/>up to a certain degree, according to the urgency of the diſorder, and to prevent a relapſe, eſpecially in chancres with hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in other inveterate caſes. It is not the mere quantity of mercury, but the method of directing its operation, which in my opinion is the chief circumſtance to be relied on in the cure. I would certainly run the riſk, if there was any, of <hi>not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately curing,</hi> rather than expoſe my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to the hazard of a large quantity of accumulated mercury ready at an hour's notice, or leſs, to emancipate itſelf from the body by ſtimulating the inteſtines, and thus exhauſting li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We may be amuſed with the theory of mercury circulating in the ſyſtem in perfect equilibrium, not inclining more to one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion than to another; but it is certain, this is a powerful medicine that ought not to be trifled with; we cannot ſay to it—So far ſhalt thou go, and no further. The moſt ſkilful pilot will find it difficult ſo to trim his veſſel that it ſhall not ſink or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn when too heavily laden with mercury.</p>
            <p>The ingenious <hi>Plenck,</hi> (to whom the world is ſo much indebted for the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements he has made by his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on mercury, and in the cure of this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0167500200:32"/>diſeaſe) ſays, that a ſalivation is a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice; for the famous <hi>Aſtruc,</hi> ſays he, aſſerts that there frequently ſupervene, violent fevers, diarrhaea, dyſentery, hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moptoe, an immobility of the jaws, and likewiſe a ſuffocation, and that too, when a ſalivation has been moſt properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted; and after him the moſt ſkilful <hi>Locher</hi> tells us the ſame.—</p>
            <p>Several years ſince a practitioner had the misfortune to loſe (within a ſhort time of each other) two patients with chancres, for the cure of which he had raiſed very high ſalivations by mercurial ointment. Juſt as their complaints were healed, and ſalivation began to decline, one of the gentlemen was ſeized with a dyſenteric flux, and expired within a few hours: his death was attributed to a piece of butter which the nurſe had inadvertently put into his gruel. The other died alſo of a flux, ariſing from the ſudden deſcent of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury overturning the equilibrium, and ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the patient's bowels with irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible impetuoſity.—</p>
            <p>To form a juſt idea of a ſalivation, we ſhould perambulate the public hoſpitals, where there are wretches miſerable indeed!
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0167500200:33"/>miſerable in having a ſad diſeaſe, but much more ſo in having a cure to encounter which makes the unhappy objects call on death for a deliverance from their pains. Their head, face, and tongue ſo ſwelled, as to forbid their uttering a ſyllable. Their cheeks often torn to pieces, a ſalivary flux of two or three quarts a day, with breath extremely offenſive, teeth looſe, tongue and gums ulcerated and inflamed, attended with a ſevere unremitting head-ach; and this proceſs is the ſame in all caſes and ſeaſons: it may truly be ſaid, ſuch remedies are worſe than the diſeaſes they are intended to remove. But this is not all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has to undergo; add to this, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſevere cholicky pains, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with diarrhaea and dyſentery, which continuing, ſo often prove fatal. The patient can ſwallow no ſolid food during this ſevere operation, and indeed ſcarcely liquids, and is almoſt dead with hunger, having often an appetite without the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of indulging it. Thus are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons confined for ſeveral weeks, and when the proceſs is finiſhed, they are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in fleſh, as to be quite a ſpectacle, and frequently go into a deep decline.—
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0167500200:34"/>If theſe evils may be prevented, and that they may, we have daily experience added to the ſtrongeſt teſtimonies, are we not all called upon by every motive of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, religion, and humanity, to preſerve the unhappy from ruin, by rejecting ſo cruel a practice?</p>

            <p>If the ſurgeons who ſuperintend the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals would make a trial of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, I am convinced from experience, they would be able, without annoying the ſtomach, to convey any quantity of any mercurial preparation into the ſyſtem in few hours, inſtead of weeks. This may be done by rubbing mercury on the back and middle of the tongue, and repeating the proceſs at the ſhorteſt intervals. There is no occaſion to wait for its operation as in the caſe of pills, but we may ſafely ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late theſe ſurfaces as much and as often as we chuſe, till we have actually produced the deſired effect on the ſyſtem. Let the mouth be well cleared of the ſaliva, and I know of no other impediment to the ſucceſs of this proceſs. Dr. <hi>Home,</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of phyſic at Edinburgh, has honoured me by making a variety of public experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0167500200:35"/>in the Edingburgh Infirmary, which will ſoon appear in the Doctor's intended publication. By theſe experiments it is proved, that mercury is more quickly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, with greater certainty, and with leſs prejudice to the conſtitution in this way, than by any of the other modes of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering it internally or externally.</p>

               <p>WITH reſpect to Pills, it is certain that many patients find a difficulty in taking them. Firſt, it is hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſo to diſtribute the mercury through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the maſs, that there ſhall not be ſome difference and uncertainty in the doſe when divided into pills; and ſecondly, they ſometimes paſs through the body undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. When they diſſolve, they irritate, perhaps corrode, the ſtomach, an organ moſt eſſential to health. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance has excited univerſal complaint and dread of mercury, which however being adminiſtered in my method, is ſo very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0167500200:36"/>mild, that it does not in the leaſt impair the conſtitution, as the ſurface on which the mercury is laid, will bear a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree of irritation without any ſort of prejudice.<note n="*" place="bottom">A grain of mercury applied to the internal ſurfaces of the mouth is thence abſorbed with the greateſt facility, and operates kindly and with effect on the habit in general.

There are few perſons who have been ſo unfortunate as to take large quantities of this mineral in the uſual way, who do not exhibit melancholy proofs of its baneful effects on the ſtomach and bowels.

               <p>Dr. <hi>Hunter</hi> obſerves, "that this proceſs is preferable to pills or boluſes, as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel ſtimulates the primae viae much leſs, and therefore he adds, people with very tender bowels may bear it much better in this form than any other."

               <p>After ample trial of all the different mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial preparations in common uſe, I find that any of them may be ſafely and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly conveyed into the ſyſtem from the ſurfaces of the mouth, and that thoſe of the moſt ſubtle and active kind are equal to the cure of the moſt confirmed diſeaſe.

                        <q>"The friction of Mercurial Ointment is to many people one of the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable things in the world. It's leaden colour, contraſted with the ſkin, makes it look dirty. It has a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly offenſive ſmell, independent of that of the turpentine, or balſam of ſulphur, which may have been employed in extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the quickſilver. From the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that half an hour's friction, or even that of a whole hour, if ever ſo well performed, will not commonly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a total abſorption of the ointment, the ſkin is generally left a little ſmeared with it: after the proceſs is over, as it is oily it does not evaporate, or dry readily, and will eaſily ſtick to whatever it touches. Patients are obliged to ſleep in flannel drawers to prevent the ointment from getting through and daubing the bed clothes. They muſt be frequently changing theſe drawers, conſtantly waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſkin; or, as waſhing off the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would retard rather than forward the cure, they muſt remain dirty for ſix weeks, or perhaps three months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if by accident any part of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0167500200:40"/>ointment gets upon their linen, from it's colour it is very apt to give the alarm in families, and lead to diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſcoveries."</q>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Manning,</hi> in his Practice of Phyſic, on the ſubject of my mercurial proceſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves as follows; "By this method we not only avoid the inconveniencies of unc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the purgative effects that are often produced by mercury when taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtomach."</p>
               <p>With reſpect to a regimen in the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lues, abſtinence and low living certainly retard the cure. Perſons afflicted with this diſtemper, are much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to deſpondency, and living more freely now than at other times, raiſes the ſpirits of the patient, and contributes to his cure by co-operating with the medicine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall continue to recommend that practice, at the ſame time ſhould object as ſtrongly as any other practitioner, to every indulgence that might be prejudicial. It has been ſaid, that people under a courſe of mercury cannot be kept too warm, which is true only when the mercury affects the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0167500200:41"/>ſtomach or bowels, or greatly opens the pores of the ſkin; but from the very mild operation of mercury on the ſyſtem in my method, patients are expoſed to all weathers, without injury to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Krohn</hi> on this ſubject ſays, "this mode agrees better with people who are debauchees, having had eſſential proof of this aſſertion in a patient who drank all kinds of ſtrong liquors, was ſcarcely ever in bed for a week together, till break of day, and was much expoſed to cold damp air."</p>

               <head>A Recapitulation of Objections to the common Methods of adminiſtering <hi>MERCURY,</hi> accompanied with ſome new Obſervations, and conveying a ſhort and pointed View of the Whole.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Lues</hi> is a venereal infection in the maſs of blood; and is to be cured by throwing a ſufficient quantity of mercury into the ſyſtem to expel it.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0167500200:42"/>
               <p>There are many ways of conveying mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury into the circulation of the blood.</p>
               <p>The uſual methods are by pills, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſes, and draughts, and alſo by outward application of mercurial ointment.</p>
               <p>The firſt three are conveyed by the mouth into the ſtomach, where the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial particles are in part abſorbed by the lymphatic veſſels of that organ, and conveyed into the blood; alſo by the ſame veſſels in the inteſtines, and frequently the greateſt portion of the mercury eſcapes out of the body by this outlet, having firſt irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the animal oeconomy throughout the whole of the canal.</p>
               <p>Mercury may be prevented from paſſing downwards by joining <hi>opium</hi> with it, which takes off its ſtimulus, and generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents its purgative effects; but this often creates ſickneſs and reaching, and ſhakes the whole nervous ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>Two grains of mercury taken up into the blood by the mouth, will produce as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an effect on the ſyſtem, as twenty grains thrown into the ſtomach, on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that eighteen of the twenty make their exit downwards: we reckon only what gets into the ſyſtem, for what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes through, <hi>is loſt,</hi> and certainly better
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0167500200:43"/>had never been given. The ſtomach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a ſink with a grate in it, and is not conſtructed to retain mercury.</p>
               <p>Mercurial ointment cures by being taken up into the blood by the abſorbents of the external ſkin, and when introduced there, by operating on the whole vaſcular ſyſtem, and expelling the venereal poiſon by the different ſecretions and excretions of the body.</p>
               <p>The objections to this mode of practice are, Firſt, that it is dirty and diſagreeable; that it is commonly ſlow and tedious: that it requires too much labour for perſons in a weak ſtate, and if the friction is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by other hands than their own, that one half of the ointment, or more, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly be loſt to the patient, and may prove very injurious to the party who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it.</p>
               <p>Mercurial ointment affects the ſtomach or bowels, and brings on purging; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it is not uncommon for patients, both in public and private practice, to die under a courſe of unction, of violent cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, accompanied by ſanguinary and other fluxes, and this happens by the quantity of mercury abſorbed proving an overbalance for the conſtitution.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0167500200:44"/>
               <p>Practitioners do not accurately know what quantity of mercury may be given, and what quantity of it will take effect, as different conſtitutions require different doſes. Five grains of mercurial ointment will take more effect on one ſubject, than fifty on another; after uſing it ten or fifteen days ſucceſſively, no viſible effect may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on the conſtitution; yet, on the eighteenth or twentieth, a ſalivary flux may commence, and continue for a fortnight or three weeks, and the patient's ſtrength become exhauſted. At this juncture ſhould a diarrhaea unfortunately take place, it carries off the patient in a few hours, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the endeavours of the moſt ſkilful of the faculty.</p>
               <p>I have made uſe of ſuch arguments as have occurred to me in behalf of this new method, and have advanced nothing but what my repeated experience doth fully warrant. If the ideas of other practitioners do not coincide with mine, I ſhall be happy to ſee their avowed and printed ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents on this important ſubject, diveſted of prejudice and delivered with candour.</p>
               <p>Should it be aſſerted that this method ſometimes fails, let not that declaration pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the trying it, as this may be urged
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0167500200:45"/>againſt all medical practice, and often, no doubt, with the greateſt injuſtice.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that this proceſs, by ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cure and leſſening the medicines, will diminiſh the fee. The profeſſion need not object to it on that account, as they are paid, not for their medicine, this being no object, but for their ſkill and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Patients of liberal diſpoſitions will always be pleaſed with diſpatch and make a handſome return: and others will find their intereſt alſo in behaving in the ſame equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manner.</p>
