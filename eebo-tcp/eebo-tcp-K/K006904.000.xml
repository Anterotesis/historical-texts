            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is nothing ſo impoſſible in Nature, but Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks
will undertake; nothing ſo incredible,
but they will affirm: Mrs. <hi>Bull</hi>'s Condition was
look'd upon as deſperate by all the Men of Art; then
Signior <hi>Cavallo</hi> judged it was high time for him to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
he bragged that he had an infallible Ointment and
Plaiſter, which being applied to the Sore would Cure
it in a few Days; at the ſame time he would give her
a Pill that would purge off all her bad Humours, ſweeten
her Blood, and rectifie her diſturb'd Imagination: In
ſpite of all Signior <hi>Cavallo</hi>'s Applications the Patient
grew worſe every Day, ſhe ſtank ſo no body durſt come
within a Stone's throw of her, except Signior <hi>Cavallo</hi>
and his Wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom he ſent every Day to Dreſs her, ſhe
having a very gentle ſoft Hand. All this while Signior
apprehended no Danger. If one ask'd him how Mrs.
<hi>Bull</hi> did, better and better, ſays Signior <hi>Cavallo;</hi> the
Parts heal, and her Conſtitution mends, if ſhe ſubmits
to my Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe will be abroad in a little time.
Nay, it is reported, that he wrote to her Friends in the
Country, that ſhe ſhould Dance a Jig next <hi>October</hi> in
<hi>Weſtmiſter</hi>-Hall; that her Illneſs had been chiefly owing
to bad Phyſicians. At laſt Signior one Day was ſent
<pb facs="tcp:0147503300:12"/>
for in great haſte, his Patient growing worſe and worſe;
when he came he affirmed, that it was a groſs Miſtake,
that ſhe never was in a fairer Way: Bring hither the
Salve, ſays he; and give her a plentiful Draught of my
Cordial. As he was applying his Ointments, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring
the Cordial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Patient gave up the Ghoſt, to
the great Confuſion of Signior <hi>Cavalio,</hi> and the great Joy
of <hi>Bull</hi> and his Friends. Signior ſlung away out of the
Houſe in great diſorder, and ſwore there was foul Play,
for he was ſure his Medicines were infallible. Mrs. <hi>Bull</hi>
having dy'd without any Signs of Repentance or Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Clergy would hardly allow her Chriſtian Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.
The Relations had once reſolved to ſue <hi>John</hi> for
the Murder, but conſidering better of it, and that ſuch
a Trial would rip up old Sores, and diſcover things not
ſo much to the Reputation of the Deceaſed, they dropt
their Deſign. She left no Will, only there was found
