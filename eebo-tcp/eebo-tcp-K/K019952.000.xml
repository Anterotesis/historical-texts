            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>IT is a juſt image given us by Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> of the ſituation of an author, where he mentions a POET ambitious of praiſe, and a CRITIC picking his pocket. It is, indeed, almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any man to diſtinguiſh himſelf in the literary world, without having a gang of theſe people ſwarming about him; though he has at the ſame time this conſolation, that all ſuch <hi>petty larceny</hi> attempts are a mark of his fame; and the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked abuſe of ill-deſigning perſons is, in its own nature, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary praiſe.</p>
            <p>The author of the following trifle has had his ſhare of this kind of trouble ever ſince his name has been heard of: he has boaſted, upon a former occaſion, of the honour a certain reverend writer did him by his calumny; but, as if that was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, his name is now adorned with a PARSON CHURCHILL. This laſt perſon's hand he has felt in his pocket twice in a very ſhort time: in the <hi>Roſciad</hi> it was but a dip, and away; but as if
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:1205901300:3"/>this aſtoniſhing genius, who has lately amazed mankind, had improved in his trade, in his <hi>Apology</hi> he has attempted to make an intire rummage. Whether he has taken any thing out of the preſent writer's pocket, is a point not very certain; ſo that the loſs, however, cannot be very great.</p>
            <p>But it may be aſked, Can the Reverend Mr. <hi>Churchill,</hi> Curate of <hi>St. John's, Weſtminſter,</hi> be conſidered as Mr. <hi>Murphy</hi>'s lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary pickpocket, when he boldly owns his name, and ſhews himſelf to the public?—In anſwer to this, it ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that theſe people have various ways of doing their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Some of them ſneak in alleys, and little lurking holes, and, as a gentleman paſſes by, they make a ſnatch at his pocket; and ſhould they prove ſo unfortunate as to give an alarm, and meet with a ſhort turn, "<hi>Pray remember the poor—for the love of</hi>—" Others of them go more daringly to work—<q>Bob, <hi>do you ſee that gentleman yonder?—ſhall I</hi> DO <hi>him?</hi>
               </q>—<q>
                  <hi>Ay! ay!</hi> cries Bob, <hi>do him by all means.</hi>
               </q>— <q>
                  <hi>So I will—Link your honour—light your honour acroſs the ſtreet—my name is</hi> CHARLEY DUNGHILL—<hi>I ply here every night, your honour</hi>—</q> Then on he runs, twirling his link almoſt in your face;—gives you an unlucky ſplaſh, and, in your ſudden confuſion, makes a ſnap at your handkerchief: his friends admire his dexterity; he is proclaimed abroad for a notable clever fellow; you are told he is a bruiſer into the bargain, and handles an OAK-STICK won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully!
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:1205901300:4"/>This will be acknowledged to be the caſe among the pilferers in our common ſtreets; and among their brethren of the quill the conduct is ſo ſimilar, that the writer of the ſubſequent Ode cannot conſider the REVEREND CHARLES CHURCHILL in any other light than that of a CRITIC PICKING HIS POCKET; and as he is well informed that Mr. <hi>John Fielding</hi> has attained many points, highly ſerviceable to ſociety, by <hi>quick notice and ſudden purſuit</hi> among the nimble-fingered race, who infeſt this metropolis, he is in hopes that the ſame means will operate equally in the literary world. For this purpoſe, he now thinks proper to celebrate the egregious endowments of this New Adventurer; deſiring it may be remembered, that this is the firſt notice he has given of him: for, notwithſtanding the inſinuations of Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> and his friends, be it hereby known, that Mr. <hi>Murphy</hi> never wrote, or cauſed to be written, directly or indirectly, a ſingle line in the <hi>Critical Review.</hi> In juſtice, however, to the public, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he thinks it now incumbent on him to give the beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription he can of the man who has, at two different times, made an attempt upon him. Should this furious <hi>Drawcanſir,</hi> after this, think proper to proceed in his deſign, Mr. <hi>Murphy,</hi> in conſideration of his being <hi>unbeneficed,</hi> and reflecting how hard the preſent dearneſs of proviſions, and the <hi>late Tax</hi> upon PORTER, muſt bear upon the Reverend Bard, moſt heartily gives his conſent to be abuſed by him <hi>"Body, Soul, and Muſe,"</hi> as often as thirſt or
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1205901300:5"/>hunger ſhall prompt his genius: and ſhould he be told hereafter, that the author of unpoetic libels is not hurt in his preferment, but that "to one biſhop, <hi>Churchill</hi> ſeems a wit," he promiſes him to repine leſs at his ſucceſs, though provoked, than Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> and his little faction ſeem, unprovoked, to have done at Mr. <hi>Murphy</hi>'s.</p>
