         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SINCE the firſt publication of this work, the author has annually enlarged and improved it. It muſt occur to every one, that time only, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual reading, can add to the collection; which makes every new edition more valuable than the laſt. It has been the author's ſtudy to examine into the accuracy of dates, and reconcile the difference of hiſtorians, who vary in nothing more than in the times when events happened, owing to different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencements of the year with different people. The Jews began the year with the month of March; the Athenians, with June; the Macedonians, with the 24th of September; the Chriſtians of Egypt and Ethiopia, with the 29th or 30th of Auguſt; the Perſians and Armenians, with the 11th of the ſame month; but moſt chriſtians of the Weſtern world reckon from the 1ſt of January. Indeed, from the Roman Conqueſt to Bede, time ſeems to have been computed from Chriſtmas day. The Saxon chronicle begins the year from the birth of our Lord. At the beginning of the 13th century, ſome computed from the Annunciation, ſome from the Nativity, ſome from the Circumciſion, and others from the Paſſion of our Lord; of courſe, there was no fixed rule of computation in Gervaſe of Canterbury's time. Matt. Paris, Matt. Weſtminſter, Ralph de Diceto, and Polydore Virgil, place the Coronation of William I. on Chriſtmas day, 1067. Hence it appears, that they began the year on that day. Walſingham and Brompton refer it to Chriſtmas day, 1066, which proves, that they did not begin the year till <hi>after</hi> that day. At the Reformation, the year was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to begin on the 25th of March; but others ſay, in 1265; that being ſuppoſed by ſome, to have
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0186401601:4"/>been the day when the world was created, and when Chriſt was conceived: it thus continued till 1752, when it was brought back to the 1ſt of January. The Scots, from time immemorial, obſerved the 25th of March as the firſt day of the year, till Nov. 27, 1599; when the 1ſt of January was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by proclamation, to be the beginning of the year there.</p>
            <p>From theſe variations in the computation of time, reſpecting the commencement of the year, &amp;c. we may account for the difference of dates in the ſeveral hiſtorians. It has been the ſtudy, therefore, of the Author of this work, as far as poſſible, to reconcile them; and he has happily ſucceeded in a thouſand inſtances, and in all he is as correct, as a work of this kind (which conſiſts chiefly of figures) is capable of; he flatters himſelf, therefore, it will be found ſuperior to other books of chronology, where no ſuch attention has been paid. He has induſtriouſly thrown out, alſo, all unimportant matter, and given the Reader only ſuch occurrences as he muſt wiſh to be acquainted with.</p>
            <p>This work being found highly proper to be put into the hands of youth, chronology being one of the chief branches of the <hi>belles lettres;</hi> to adapt it for the purpoſe, this edition is publiſhed; wherein the author has given a more enlarged view of Engliſh hiſtory, and flatters himſelf he has thus rendered it a complete ſchool-book. It is already received at Weſtminſter, Eaton, Wincheſter, Marybone, &amp;c. &amp;c. and all other great ſchools, as well for boys as for girls.</p>
            <p>☞ A ſmall edition of this work, ſo contrived as not to exceed the ſize of a pocket almanack, may be had of all the bookſellers, price 1s. 6d.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE events of different reigns, as they aroſe, may be found, by turning to the reſpective kings one after another.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to dates, no notice is taken of the Old Stile, but they are regulated according to the New; thus January 1741/2, is called January, 1742.</p>
            <p>As to ages, this rule is obſerved; if a perſon at his death had entered only in his 40th year, he is recorded to have died, aged 39.</p>
            <p>Names to which St. is prefixed, if not found by the firſt letter of the name, may under the word Saint.</p>
            <p>The times in which ſuch writers lived, as were biſhops, if not found in alphabetical order, may be ſeen by turning to the liſt of biſhops.</p>
            <p>Where no diſtinction of country is made to the peerages, that of England is implied.</p>
            <p>Where references are made to <hi>Rem. Occur.</hi> it means to thoſe remarkable occurrences at the beginning of the Second Volume, which could not be ſo well thrown into alphabetical order.</p>
            <p>This volume ſerves as a complete Index to all the Hiſtories of England extant, by referring to the years in which occurrences happened. The years are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally marked in the margins of the various hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</p>
            <p>Several hiſtorical facts will be found, by referring to particular names in Vol. II.</p>
            <p>The author will be very thankful for any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, additions, or improvements left with his publiſher, R. BALDWIN.</p>
