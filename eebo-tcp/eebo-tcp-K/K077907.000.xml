            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Think it Neceſſary for my own Vindication to ſay Something by Way of Preface, and I expect to be pardon'd for it by all Honeſt Impartial Men; for 'tis to ſuch only I appeal, having already ſuffer'd as much as I could ſuffer, from Men of a Character quite contrary.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry I have it to ſay, That the worſt Uſage I have met with, has
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0001601100:8"/>been from the Gentlemen of my own Profeſſion; and that this Trifle of mine whilſt an <hi>Embryo,</hi> has been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ridicul'd by them: 'Tis, perhaps, ſtill ſhapeleſs and unform'd; but if there are found in it the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a Man, 'twill at leaſt demand ſome Regard from all thoſe who would deſerve the Character of Men. I have been driven to ſuch a <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> by their Unnatural Treatment, that for ſome Time I have ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Publication, and was once reſolv'd intirely to ſuppreſs it. This following has been their Way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, <hi>If 'tis his Own, 'twill not bear the Light; if 'twill bear the Light, 'tis not his Own;</hi> either Side of this would be equally prejudicial to me: But I ſhall endeavour to prove, that if I have not made a very ill Uſe of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0001601100:9"/>my Time and Advantages, it may bear the Light, and yet be my Own.</p>
            <p>When I have done this in the beſt Manner I am capable, I ſhall deſire this following Fair Challenge may be annex'd to my Account of Myſelf: That if any of my <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkind Brethren</hi> have any Thing to ſay, which They think will prove me too ignorant for my Profeſſion, that they may do it in the ſame publick Manner which I have made Uſe of to prove that I am not ſo.</p>
            <p>The Worthy Gentleman to whom I have made an Offer of this Trifle in the <hi>Dedication,</hi> will be my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of rhe Truth of the following Particulars: That I attended the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Hoſpital regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0001601100:10"/>and diligently the Time I was a PUPIL there, and that it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd at that Time with a Sett of the Beſt and moſt Rational Practitioners which have been ever known there.</p>
            <p>I think according to the Account of the Hoſpital, that there are very ſeldom leſs than 4 or 5000 Subjects cured of their ſeveral Diſeaſes in a Year; and I believe it will very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be granted by all unprejudic'd People, that where Accidents are ſo various and numerous, a young Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon may improve himſelf more in five or ſix Months, than he can with the beſt private Maſter in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in as many Years: Here more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a Man has the Opportunity of learning every Branch of his Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and he who does not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0001601100:11"/>to practiſe it afterwards, as it comes in his Way, ought (I think) to be ſuſpected of great Negligence in his Obſervation, or Want of Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſee into the Reaſon of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; either of which will certainly make him fearful of undertaking it, becauſe the Succeſs will always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear doubtful to him: But when a Man has by diligent Obſervation on the Chirurgical Part, and a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Knowledge of the Rational, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd himſelf to diſcharge the Duty of his Profeſſion with Ability and Honeſty, I think his endeavouring to do ſo, ſhould not only not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him obnoxious to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his Profeſſion, but even make him claim ſome Share of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and Protection too from the Inſults of the reſt of the World:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0001601100:12"/>But to come nearer to the Point, and the Occaſion of this <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I came to practiſe in this City, full of Expectation of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage juſt now mention'd, I ſoon found myſelf miſerably deceiv'd; for inſtead of That, I was immediately ſurrounded with <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> And from what Quarter? Why even from thoſe Gentlemen by whom I thought to be <hi>Protected:</hi> There was immediately a <hi>Party</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt me, who not contented with aſperſing my Abilities, fell foul upon my Manners; and would fain have inſinuated, (if they could have got any Man of Senſe to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd them) that if a Man wore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable good Cloaths, and lik'd the Company of a Friend, 'twas impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0001601100:13"/>he could be a good Surgeon: Theſe are a Sett of worthy People, who are themſelves</p>
            <q>
               <l>— Dully grave, inſipidly ſerene,</l>
               <l>And carry all their Wiſdom in their Mien.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And in ſhort, they like Nobody, but ſuch as are like themſelves: So that an Awkard <hi>Saint-like</hi> Behaviour, a <hi>Solemn</hi> Gait, an <hi>Hypocritial</hi> Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eye, and an <hi>Affected Religious</hi> Grimace, is ſufficient with them to ſet a Man at the Head of his Profeſſion. If a Man is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to any of them, the Firſt Queſtion is, <hi>Is he One of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s?</hi> If they are anſwer'd in the Negative, they immediately fly; and tho' they know Nothing of the Man, ſwear he has no Faith, no Honour, no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0001601100:14"/>no Money, nor any Thing elſe which can render a Man quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd to be employ'd in any Thing.</p>
            <p>'Tis a great Hardſhip to fall into the Hands of theſe Gentlemen, and yet to be quite void of all thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Talents which muſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend one to their Favour. For my Part, if I am call'd to a Patient, I expect my Buſineſs is with his <hi>Body,</hi> and not with his <hi>Soul:</hi> I can <hi>Set</hi> a Broken Leg, as well as my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but as to <hi>Caſes of Conſcience,</hi> I muſt leave them to be ſet right by Gentlemen whoſe Profeſſion qualifies and authorizes them to do it.</p>
            <p>But I am afraid, if we come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin the Matter a little more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhall find that this is generally
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0001601100:15"/>all Stratagem; and that my <hi>Worthy</hi> Brethren who make uſe of it, have an odd Way of impoſing upon the World, and giving of it one Term for another: Their pretended <hi>Gravity</hi> ſhould be call'd <hi>Natural Dulneſs,</hi> for 'tis ſo in Fact; and where there is Fire, it will ſhew itſelf: Their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to <hi>Religion,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Human Reaſon,</hi> is not becauſe they have <hi>more</hi> of the Firſt than their Neighbours, but <hi>leſs</hi> of the Latter: Their <hi>Canting</hi> Cuſtom of Asking a peculiar Bleſſing on every Thing they undertake, is becauſe they know their Skill will ſtand very much in Need of it: Their Diſaffection to Human Learning is, becauſe they know Nothing more of it than the Name; and ſo of every Thing elſe;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0001601100:16"/>In ſhort, I am tir'd of them; but I'll beg Leave to ſay, they are very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty People to truſt Mens Lives and Limbs with.</p>
            <p>I have often wonder'd, that when the ACT was made for Examining all Surgeons (before they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to practiſe in and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) at <hi>Surgeons-Hall,</hi> the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der did not paſs thro' every County, that the Country might have had the ſame Advantage of having a Sett of Able Men amongſt them as the Town has: Many and great would have been the Benefits of it, to the Profeſſion in General, to every Able Profeſſor of it in Particular, and to all thoſe whoſe Misfortunes oblige them to have Recourſe to It or Them for Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0001601100:17"/>Every Apprentice would be oblig'd to be diligently attentive in his Buſineſs, in order to qualifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to paſs his Examination; and this certainly in Time would be of infinite Advantage to the Profeſſion: Every Able Profeſſor of it would certainly be known, by that very Examination, to be ſo; and by this Means would be plac'd in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sphere, and fear no Danger from the <hi>Canting Blockheads</hi> beneath him. The Benefit of the Patient, is too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to be inſiſted upon; his Limbs very frequently, and often his Life too would be preſerv'd by it.</p>
            <p>But as a <hi>Capacity</hi> is not Every Thing which is requir'd of a Surgeon, I wiſh there was any Method as certain as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0001601100:18"/>this, to try their <hi>Honeſty:</hi> Some I have known who have wanted Both, others who have had the Firſt and wanted the Latter; but in order to make a Good Surgeon, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary that a Man ſhould want Neither of them. I'll beg the Liberty to relate a Story or Two of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who has been remarkably kind to me, and I am very glad I have this Opportunity of returning his Civility, and letting the World know that he is a Man of <hi>Real Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> This Friend of mine was ſent for to a Child that had diſlocated its Knee, he carried with him Plaiſters, Bandage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in order to reduce it, which he endeavour'd to do in the beſt Manner his Capacity would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of; after the Buſineſs was over,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0001601100:19"/>he encourag'd the Friends by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the greateſt Succeſs: Next Day he call'd to ſee his little Patient, and found the Family much pleas'd at his <hi>great</hi> Skill, declaring that the Child's Complaint in that Part was intirely remov'd: The Doctor finding in this Caſe that he had not ſpent his Skill in vain, began to exert himſelf upon it, and undertook a Caſe of much more Difficulty, (which prov'd a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>location</hi> in Fact) in which he aſſured them of the like Succeſs, and that he would cure that as expeditiouſly as he did the other; which, to prove his Aſſertions true, he actually did; by which <hi>wonderful</hi> Cure he has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated his <hi>Genius</hi> in a <hi>laudable</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Another Brother of mine (ſome ſmall Diſtance from this Place) had the Care of a Gentlewoman, whom
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0001601100:20"/>he kept in Torment ſeveral Years, and left her at laſt as Bad or Worſe than he found her; ſhe applied her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Surgeon of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who made a perfect Cure of her in Fourteen Days: This <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi> Man was ask'd ſome Time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, How it came about that a Man of his <hi>pretended</hi> Abilities and long Practice, after a Trial of Years, ſhould miſs of Succeſs in a Caſe where a Young Fellow juſt beginning to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, ſucceeded to the Surprize of the whole Town in a few Days?

            <p>The Reaſon why this nice and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Operation is ſo rarely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Gentlemen regularly bred to the Profeſſion of Surgery, I take to be this; That it having been a long Time the diſtinguiſhing Excellency of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of our famous Mountebanks, the regular Surgeons, by undertaking it, are under the dreadful Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of being rank'd with itinerant Operators, commonly known by the Name of <hi>Quacks:</hi> The Fault is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely their own; for did they not join with theſe <hi>Empiricks</hi> (whom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Mechaniſm of the EYE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I have propos'd to give ſome Account of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm of the EYE, I know no properer Way of beginning it, than by an Anatomical Diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the EYE Itſelf; and after I have ſhewn ſome few general Diſeaſes that the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Coats and Humors of the Eye are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, I ſhall proceed to ſhew how the ſaid Coats and Humors are inſtrumental to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0001601100:26"/>Viſion, and then by what particular Diſeaſes the Eye is render'd Totally Opake: And there I ſhall endeavour to aſcertain the true Place of a <hi>Cataract,</hi> and the Conſequence of a <hi>judicious</hi> or <hi>injudicious</hi> Removal of It.</p>
            <p>The Globe of the Eye is moved by Six Muſcles, Four Streight, and Two Oblique, <hi>viz. Elevator; Depreſſor, Adductor, Abductor, Obliquus Superior,</hi> and <hi>Inferior:</hi> The Firſt of theſe ariſes out of the Bottom of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> and after it has aſcended and grown ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous, is inſerted into the Upper Part of the <hi>Tunica Sclerotis,</hi> near the <hi>Cornea.</hi> The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor</hi> ariſes and is inſerted directly oppoſite to the <hi>Elevator.</hi> The <hi>Adductor</hi> ariſes from the Bottom of the <hi>Orbit,</hi> and is inſerted on the Side next the Noſe, into the <hi>Tunica Scle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotis.</hi> The <hi>Abductor</hi> ariſes and is inſerted directly oppoſite to the <hi>Adductor.</hi> The <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior</hi> Oblique Muſcle ariſes between the <hi>Elevator</hi> and <hi>Adductor,</hi> at the Bottom of the <hi>Orbit,</hi> thence aſcending by the <hi>Sutura Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalis</hi> becomes a Round Tendon, which paſſes thro' a little Annular Cartilage call'd <hi>Trochlea,</hi> (from its bearing the Form of a Pully) at the upper and inner Part of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0001601100:27"/>
               <hi>Orbit</hi> near its Edge, is inſerted near the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Eye. The <hi>Inferior</hi> Oblique Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ariſes from the <hi>Os Maxillae Superioris,</hi> thence paſſing over the <hi>Depreſſor,</hi> is inſerted at the Bottom of the Eye near the <hi>Abductor.</hi> The Four Streight Muſcles are ſo fix'd to the <hi>Sclerotis,</hi> that they lift up the Eye, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, bring it towards the Noſe or from it, hold it faſt, turn it round, juſt as they act either ſeparately or conjointly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Superior</hi> Oblique Muſcle moves the Eye round towards the Noſe about its <hi>Axis,</hi> and pulls it upward and inward, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by directs the Pupil outward and downward; and thus the Eye is diſpos'd to ſee Things placed near it. The <hi>Inferior</hi> Oblique Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle turns the Eye towards the outward Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and alſo upwards; if theſe Two act together, they fix the Eye fierce and protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berant out of the <hi>Orbit:</hi> Moreover, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Uſe of theſe Muſcles is, to ſuſpend the Eye, and render it very fit to perform the Motions of the other Four. Between theſe Muſcles Fat is interſpers'd, which ſerves to lubricate and facilitate their Motion.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0001601100:28"/>
            <p>Next we come to the <hi>Coats</hi> and <hi>Humors</hi> of the Eye: The firſt is the <hi>Tunica Adnata,</hi> or <hi>Conjunctiva;</hi> it makes that which is call'd the White of the Eye, and is full of Blood-Veſſels; which are very viſible in an <hi>Ophthalmia:</hi> The Symptoms of this Diſeaſe are Heat, Pain, Pulſation, and an apparent Diſtention of theſe Blood-Veſſels; it may be occaſion'd externally, by any Thing forc'd againſt or coming into the Eye, irritating or compreſſing the Fibres of this Coat. If this Inflammation be only external, the Caſe ſymptomatical, and the Patient not worne out by other Diſeaſes, 'tis eaſily Curable: On the Contrary, if it becomes ſo great as to tumefie the Face, and the Humors very pungent and corroſive, we judge it difficult to cure. Its Cure depends on Bleeding, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Purgation, Bliſtring, Cupping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Aſſiſtance of a cooling Diet, topical Application, and proper <hi>Collyria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Coat is the <hi>Sclerotis:</hi> It expandes itſelf nearly into a Globe, membranous and hard almoſt like Leather, and encompaſſes the whole Eye, growing gradually thinner, clearer, and prominent in the Fore-part,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0001601100:29"/>which Part of it is call'd <hi>Cornea,</hi> from its Tranſparency; they make together one firm Coat, for the Uſe of the other Coats and Humors. This Coat is ſometimes diſeas'd by a little White Speck of a Cartilaginous Subſtance, covering Part of, and ſometimes the whole <hi>Pupilla:</hi> If this Excreſcence is only ſuperficial, it may be remov'd by an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration in Surgery call'd <hi>Leucotomy;</hi> but if the <hi>Cornea</hi> is throly affected, I believe it incurable. This Operation is perform'd in the following Manner, <hi>viz.</hi> I place the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in a proper Poſition, and fixing the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum Oculi</hi> invented for that Purpoſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to keep the Globe without Motion, pare off the Excreſcence with a ſmall curv'd Knife, leaving as few Inequalities as poſſible; and having prevented an Inflammation by proper Repellents, I blow a Powder into the Eye; which, aſſiſted by the Motion of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, ſmooths off the Inequalities left by the Knife.</p>
            <p>Next to this Coat lies the <hi>Tunica Choroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:</hi> 'Tis a Membrane of little Firmneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much thinner than the former; 'tis ting'd by a dark Liquor ſeparated from the Blood-Veſſels,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0001601100:30"/>ſo that it appears of a ruſty dark Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; this Coat has a Perforation in it, call'd <hi>Pupilla:</hi> The Part of this Coat which makes the Circumference of this Hole, and which lies upon the Side of the Cryſtalline Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, is call'd <hi>Uvea,</hi> compos'd of circular and ſtreight Fibres; 'tis qualified by this Means to contract and dilate, as Light and Objects make different Impreſſions upon it. The Outſide of this laſt Membrane is call'd <hi>Iris,</hi> where appear different Colours: On the Inſide of it from its Circumference ariſe the <hi>Proceſſus Ciliares,</hi> made of ſhort Fibres like Lines drawn from the Circumference to the Center.</p>
            <p>The laſt Coat is the <hi>Retina,</hi> ſo call'd from its Reſemblance to a Net; it covers the whole Fund of the Eye, and is nothing more than a fine Expanſion of the Medullary Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the Optick Nerve, upon which the Rays of Light meeting in a Point, convey the Images of outward Objects to the Brain. The Diſeaſe of this Coat is call'd <hi>Gutta Serena;</hi> the Eye ſeems clear in Appearance, and there are no other Signs of Blindneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a preternatural Dilatation of the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilla.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0001601100:31"/>I ſhall have Occaſion to ſpeak more largely of this Diſeaſe by and by.</p>
            <p>Between theſe Coats are contain'd Three Humors, the <hi>Aqueous,</hi> the <hi>Cryſtalline,</hi> and the <hi>Vitreous:</hi> The Firſt is call'd <hi>Aqueous</hi> becauſe it reſembles Water, being a thin tranſparent Fluid; it ſerves to extend the <hi>Cornea</hi> into an equal Convexity; beſides, it ſerves moreover for the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor to move forward or backward in, as Occaſion requires us to ſee Objects nearer or farther from us.</p>
            <p>Next is the <hi>Cryſtalline:</hi> It's compounded of numberleſs ſpherical Segments, cloſely u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and tranſparent; its Shape is a depreſt Spheriod, it's inclos'd in a fine Membrane call'd <hi>Aranea,</hi> and is much thicker than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Aqueous</hi> or <hi>Vitreous:</hi> Its Diſeaſes and Uſes I ſhall ſpeak of in another Place.</p>
            <p>The next is the <hi>Vitreous:</hi> It's very clear and tenacious, it lies behind the <hi>Cryſtalline,</hi> and fills the greateſt Part of the Eye; it's vaſcular on every Side, its Foreſide concave for the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor to lodge in, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0001601100:32"/>Backſide convex; it keeps the <hi>Retina</hi> and <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor at a proper Diſtance: This Humor is ſometimes ſo vitiated as to hinder or utterly deſtroy Sight, which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is often miſtook for a <hi>Gutta Serena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſpeak of the Parts of the Eye, as they are ſubſervient to Viſion.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of the Muſcles in general is to direct the Globe of the Eye, and fix it in ſuch a Poſition, as that the Rays of Light reflected from any Object which we would have viſible to us, may paſs thro' the <hi>Pupilla</hi> and paint the Image of it on the <hi>Retina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To form the Image of any Object, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Rays of Light coming from it ſhould converge and meet in a <hi>Foous:</hi> And we judge of the comparative Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of all Bodies, by the Angle which is ſubtended by thoſe Bodies before the Eye.</p>
            <p>To qualifie the Eye to perform this, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has given it a ſpherical Form, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it of tranſparent Goats and Humors; the latter to tranſmit the Rays coming from
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0001601100:33"/>the luminous Points of Objects, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to refract them in ſuch a Degree as to bring them all together in a Point on the <hi>Retina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All convex diaphanous Bodies refract the Rays of Light by Attraction, and the Ray bends towards that Part or the Body where there is the greateſt Quantity of Matter; this in convex Bodies is the Middle.</p>
            <p>Therefore all Rays on whatever Parts of ſuch Bodies they fall, are refracted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Line drawn thro' the Center of thoſe Bodies, and made to converge behind them at a Diſtance proportionable to the greater or leſs Convexity of the Bodies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Thus when the Eye is too flat, as in old People, (from a Decay of the Humors, or a Shrinking of the Coats, or both) the converging Rays do not coaleſce at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina;</hi> but would paſs on if ſuffer'd, and not come to a Point but at ſome Diſtance beyond it: By this Means Viſion becomes weak and indiſtinct.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0001601100:34"/>
            <p>On the contrary, thoſe call'd <hi>Myopes,</hi> or Near-ſighted People, have their Eyes too gibbous, and the Convexity of them is ſo great, that the Rays meet and croſs one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother before they arrive at the <hi>Retina.</hi> The former Eyes are help'd by Convex-Glaſſes, which put the Rays into a State of eaſie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction before they fall upon the Eye: The latter are help'd by Concave-Glaſſes, thro' which the Rays paſſing do diverge, and fall upon the Eye in ſuch a Manner, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a greater Degree of Refraction than they would in their natural Courſe: In the former Caſe the Eye is not help'd by the Object's appearing bigger, but more diſtinct; for very ſmall Objects are render'd diſtinctly viſible to ſuch an Eye by the Help of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex-Glaſs, whereas very large ones cannot be ſeen enough to be diſtinguiſh'd by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Eye.</p>
            <p>I don't propoſe to give any new Theory of Viſion, nor to be able to deſcribe the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it better than 'tis already done by an eminent Author; for which Reaſon I ſhall make uſe of his own Words, ſo far as they are ſerviceable to my preſent Purpoſe, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0001601100:35"/>conducive to the main End of this Treatiſe, which is to aſcertain the True PLACE of a <hi>Cataract.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Rays which come from one Point of an Object, are by the <hi>Cornea</hi> and Humors of the Eye united in a Point of the <hi>Retina,</hi> which is in a ſtreight Line, drawn from the ſame Point of the Object, thro' the Center of the Eye; and conſequently all the Rays, which come from all the Points of an Object, are united on the <hi>Retina,</hi> in the ſame Order and Proportion as the Points of the Objects are from whence thoſe Rays come.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Interpoſition which theſe Rays make upon the <hi>Retina,</hi> muſt be the Image of the Object.</p>
            <p>And thus Viſion in general is perform'd: But to know what the ſeveral Parts of the Globe contribute hereunto, it's needful to obſerve that the <hi>Cornea</hi> is more convex than any other Part of it; by which Means all the Rays are gather'd to paſs thro' the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilla,</hi> and none of them are loſt upon the <hi>Uvea.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0001601100:36"/>
            <p>The <hi>Aqueous</hi> Humor being thinneſt, and moſt liquid, eaſily changes its Figure, when either the <hi>Ligamentum Ciliare</hi> contracts, or both the Oblique Muſcles ſqueeze the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Bulb of the Eye, to render it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, when Objects are too near us.</p>
            <p>The ſtreight Fibres of the <hi>Uvea</hi> dilate the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> when there are but few Rays of Light; and the circular Fibres contract it, when there are too many.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Pupilla</hi> is contracted, we ſee moſt diſtinctly; when it is dilated, we ſee moſt clearly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Glaſſy</hi> Humor keeps the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> at ſuch a Diſtance from the <hi>Retina,</hi> as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for uniting the Rays, which come from one Point of the Object, exactly in one Point of the <hi>Retina.</hi> The Impreſſion of the Object is made upon the <hi>Retina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Choroides</hi> is tinctur'd black, that the Rays of Light which paſs thro' the <hi>Retina</hi> may not be reflected back again to confuſe the Image of the Object.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0001601100:37"/>
            <p>Being diſtinct, Viſion conſiſts in the Union of all the Rays which come from one Point of an Object exactly in one Point of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina;</hi> and that the Rays which come from Objects at different Diſtances, are united at different Diſtances, behind the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; they cannot both be exactly united up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Retina,</hi> therefore the Eye cannot ſee equally diſtinct, at the ſame Time, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at different Diſtances.</p>
            <p>The Optick Nerves pierce the Globe of the Eye, a little on the Inſide of the Optick <hi>Axes.</hi> Their external Coat, which is a Production of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> is continu'd to the <hi>Sclerotis,</hi> as their internal from the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> is to the <hi>Choroides;</hi> and their medullary Fibres paſſing thro' all, are expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the <hi>Retina,</hi> upon which the Images of Objects are painted.</p>
            <p>The Center of this Expanſion is inſenſible, and all Rays which fall upon it are loſt; and conſequently that Point of the Object from which thoſe Rays come, is inviſible to the Eye: The Reaſon of which proceeds proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from the Blood-Veſſels, which enter with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0001601100:38"/>the Optick Nerve, and cover this Part of the <hi>Retina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatſoever its Cauſe is, there is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Advantage in the Optick Nerves being inſerted on the Inſide of the Optick <hi>Axes:</hi> For if they had pierc'd the Eye in the <hi>Axis,</hi> then the middle Point of every Object had been inviſible; and where all Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to make us ſee beſt, there we had not ſeen at all.</p>
            <p>We muſt likewiſe have loſt ſome Part of an Object, if the Optick Nerves had been placed on the Outſide of the Optick <hi>Axes:</hi> Becauſe an Object may be ſo placed, as that all the Rays which come from one Point, may fall upon the Outſide of both Eyes: But it is impoſſible they ſhould fall upon the Inſide of both Eyes; and therefore that Point which is loſt in one Eye, is viſible by the other.</p>
            <p>This ſhall ſerve for the general The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of VISION: I ſhall now come to ſpeak of a few Diſeaſes of the Eye, by which Viſion is render'd incompleat, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0001601100:39"/>deſtroy'd: And firſt of the CATA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACT.</p>
            <p>Before I define a <hi>Cataract,</hi> 'twill be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to premiſe a few Things, in Order to clear the Way for my Definition: For ſince the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> I go upon is New, and not yet clearly demonſtrated, it would be look'd upon as a ſtrange Peice of Preſumption to overlook in the Groſs all the different Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which may be made againſt it, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie myſelf with only a few Probabilities (collected out of my own little Experience and Obſervation) which may ſeem to make for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> I. 'Tis Demonſtrated by the Mathematicians, that neither Corpuſcles in the <hi>Aqueous</hi> or <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd on the <hi>Retina;</hi> and 'tis ſaid by Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, that a Beginning of a <hi>Cataract</hi> is a Suffuſion of the Eye, when little Clouds, Motes, and Flies, ſeem to float about in the Air: Now if theſe Aſſertions are both true, one would be apt to conclude, that neither the <hi>Aqueous</hi> nor <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor can be the Seat of a <hi>Cataract:</hi> The firſt is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0001601100:40"/>but the latter is not always True in Fact.</p>
            <p>For I have known a good Number of Subject with real Confirm'd <hi>Cataracts,</hi> who never remember to have been thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the Beginning of them.</p>
            <p>And altho' ſome at the Beginning of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts</hi> are thus affected, 'tis no Proof that the Diſeaſe may not be in one or the other of theſe Humors: For the ſame Cauſe which will produce a <hi>Cataract,</hi> may at the ſame Time the <hi>Cataract</hi> is forming affect alſo the Fund of the Eye; and by diſordering the Blood-Veſſels, here and there ſtop the Influx of the Animal Spirits into the little Filaments of the Optick Nerve which help to make the <hi>Retina.</hi> This will certainly produce them Clouds, Motes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I have the more Reaſon to believe this, becauſe I have Couch'd ſeveral who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Cataract</hi> has been well ſuppreſt, have remain'd blind with a <hi>Gutta Serena;</hi> which is, I ſuppoſe, a total Stoppage of the Influx of the Animal Spirits into the nervous Filaments afore-mention'd.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0001601100:41"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> II. 'Tis ſuppos'd, that without the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor there could be no Viſion; that is, except that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor lay always ready to receive the Rays and refract them after they had paſs'd the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> they would ſtill proceed with ſo ſmall a Degree of Refraction that their Place of Converging would be beyond the <hi>Retina;</hi> and by Conſequence Viſion would be render'd very indiſtinct, or perhaps the Eye would only perceive a confuſs'd Glare of Light; if this Humor was taken away, and this could be demonſtrated, 'twould not deſtroy my Suppoſition: For I freely acknowledge, that after the Removal of a <hi>Cataract,</hi> (or the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor, which as I proceed I ſhall uſe ſynonymouſly) Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is never ſo perfectly perform'd as it was before the Eye was diſeas'd.</p>
            <p>And if the Subjects I have hitherto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Operation upon were of Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration enough to have given me Pains beyond my Needle, I make no Doubt but I could have fix'd them with Glaſſes which would have ſtill aſſiſted their Sight, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0001601100:42"/>made them ſome Amends for the Loſs of the aforeſaid Humor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> III. If Viſion can be perform'd without this Humor, and the Maxim is true <hi>Quod Natura Nihil agit fruſtra,</hi> Why was it placed in the Eye?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 'Tis placed there to enable the Eye to ſee equally well at different Diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For ſince the Rays proceeding from the luminous Points of nigh Objects diverge more than thoſe from more remote Objects, the Power of making them equally converge at the <hi>Retina</hi> is very probably lodg'd in the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor; which, according to the different Diſtances of Objects, approaches nigher to, or removes farther from the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,</hi> and perhaps too aſſumes a different Convexity.</p>
            <p>And this I look upon to be unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Becauſe I have made it my conſtant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, That after a ſucceſsful Depreſſure of a <hi>Cataract,</hi> the Patient ſees beſt at a Diſtance ſomething greater than the Eye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires when all its Parts are in their natural
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0001601100:43"/>Situation; and that if the Object is placed conſiderably further from, or nearer to the Eye, Viſion is render'd indiſtinct or confus'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> IV. But if the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor is depreſs'd, what becomes of it afterwards? And how is the Cavity fill'd up, which the ſaid Humor poſſeſs'd in its natural Situation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> When I paſs my Needle into the Eye, I preſs directly forward to the <hi>Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> Humor, and endeavouring to diſengage it from the <hi>Ligamentum Ciliare,</hi> I depreſs it to the Bottom of the <hi>Vitreous</hi> Humor; when the <hi>Pupilla</hi> immediately ſeems clear to me, and ſuch a Torrent of confus'd Light ruſhes into the Eye, as ſometimes affrights the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient even more than the Puncture of the Needle.</p>
            <p>Common Senſe tells us, That if a ſolid Body which is immers'd in a Fluid ſhould be remov'd from one Part of that Fluid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, it makes no Alteration in the Bulk of the Whole; for whatever Place the Solid is remov'd to, it fills up but ſo much Space preciſely as it did in the Space which it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0001601100:44"/>was remov'd from. Immediately upon the Removal of the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous</hi> turns in and fills up the Cavity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> From the different Specifick Gravity of the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor, which in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability is different in different Stages of the Diſtemper, we may account for what is call'd the Riſing again of the <hi>Cataract:</hi> As to what becomes of the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 'tis depreſs'd, 'tis not unlikely that being broke from the Veſſels which nouriſh'd it, it ſhrinks by Degrees, and as it were melts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Vitreoeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> ſays, A <hi>Cataract</hi> is a Diſeaſe of the Eye, in which a Film or Skin grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> like a Curtain drawn againſt a Hole letting the Light into a Room, hinders the Paſſage of the ſame, till it is depreſs'd by the Needle, as in Couching.</p>
            <p>There is no one of my Profeſſion who pays a greater Veneration to the Authority of that worthy, learned, and ingenious Gentleman, than myſelf; I am beholden to him that I have a regular, methodical, and I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0001601100:45"/>to ſay a certain Syſtem of Surgery in my Head and Hand; but as he himſelf (who had always more Buſineſs in other Parts of Surgery than a Man of his ſtudious Temper could well attend to) very rarely, if ever perform'd the Operation, I hope 'twill not be thought Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption if when I come to ſpeak of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration itſelf, I ſhould venture to give ſome Reaſons which may ſeem to thwart his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and eſtabliſh my own.</p>
            <p>That there are ſuch Films as the Doctor mentions on this Side the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> and in the <hi>Aqueous Humor,</hi> I can readily grant, having met with ſeveral of them in the little Courſe of my Practice: Theſe the Practitioners are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to call <hi>Suffuſions, Films, &amp;c.</hi> but not <hi>Cataracts;</hi> for I am determin'd to call no Diſeaſe of the Eye by this latter Name, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that particular One which is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by the Uſe of the Needle: But the, Caſe as mention'd by the Doctor can receive no Benefit that I know of by the Operation, nor did I ever attempt to Couch a Patient (tho' I have had ſeveral offer'd me) when the Circumſtances were as before-mention'd: This I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate, in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Operation itſelf.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0001601100:46"/>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Authors, with <hi>Vaughion</hi> at the Head of them, imagine a <hi>Cataract</hi> to be a Film ſeparated from the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor, and floating in tine <hi>Aqueous;</hi> that all its Parts are exiſtent in its firſt Conformation, that it is a <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> and that <hi>Cyſtiſſes</hi> are never form'd <hi>de novo,</hi> but are only Membranes diſengag'd from the neighbouring Parts, which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Thickneſs receive Nouriſhment from the Parts to which they adhere.</p>
            <p>I ſhall beg Leave to examine this Opinion a little, and however ſpecious and refin'd it may ſeem, I am afraid we ſhall find as little Reality in it, as there is in the ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Friendſhip amongſt the Gentlemen of their Country.</p>
            <p>Firſt they ſay, 'tis a Membrane diſengag'd from the <hi>Cryſtalline,</hi> and floating in the <hi>Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> the firſt they don't offer to prove, and the latter is falſe in Fact: For if this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſengag'd Membrane ſhould float in the <hi>Aqueous,</hi> the Patient would have at leaſt a Chance of ſeeing now and then a little, by its being remov'd wholy or in part from before the <hi>Pupilla;</hi> but ſuch a Removal we
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0001601100:47"/>find never happens; and that after the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>Cataract,</hi> the Eye continues in a conſtant equal Blindneſs, till the Cauſe is remov'd by the Needle: I muſt beg them then to fix their floating Iſland, before they pretend to make a rational <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of it; and if they do, I hope they'll be ſo kind as to let us know to what Membranes they'll join it, and in what Manner it receives Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from them, then we'll talk farther with them.</p>
            <p>What have led the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> into the Talk of its being a <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> and that no <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſſes</hi> are form'd <hi>de novo,</hi> is the late Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries made by the Improvements of Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes. They are wonderfully pleas'd with and fond of the Opinion, that every Thing which is proceeds originally from an Egg or Seed; but however true this may be of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Beings, I don't expect that the ſame will be aſſerted of the <hi>Fungus</hi>'s of Trees, and other ſupernatural Excreſcences: I can be very well content to believe, that Sloughs and <hi>Mucus</hi> may be detach'd from ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes in the Body, and may afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by an Addition of the ſame Matter,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0001601100:48"/>and yet there may be no <hi>Cyſtis;</hi> but I ſhall prove preſently, that 'tis impoſſible a <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract</hi> ſhould be in this Part of the Eye; and that will at once put an End to the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0001601100:49"/>Humor dark and cloudy, may be term'd a <hi>Cataract;</hi> for he ſeems to uſe the Word <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taract</hi> not as any particular Diſeaſe, but only as ſomething which ſhall darken and obſcure the Sight, by hindring the Tranſmiſſion of the Rays of Light. Thus the <hi>Albugo, Pterygium, Hyopyon,</hi> or the Viſcidity of the <hi>Aqueous</hi> Humor, frequently conſequent upon an <hi>Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmia,</hi> may be juſtly deem'd a <hi>Cataract.</hi> But how this ſquares with the real Notion of this Diſeaſe, and its Cure, I ſhall leave my Readers after a few Pages to determine.</p>
            <p>But paſſing over all the different Definitions and Surmiſes of others, I ſhall take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (for Reaſons which I ſhall give after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) to define it in the following Manner.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Cataract</hi> is a Diſeaſe of the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor, whereby the ſaid Humor is totally or at leaſt one Side of it render'd opake: The Humor in this diſeas'd State reflect all or moſt of the Rays of Light, inſtead of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to the <hi>Retina;</hi> in Conſequence of which, the Humor appears whitiſh, bluiſh, yellowiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Eye is blind.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0001601100:50"/>
               <head>CAUSES.</head>
               <p>Any Blow or Shock, which may alter the particular Poſition of the Particles of which this Humor is compos'd: for to make a Body diaphanous, 'tis not only neceſſary that it ſhould be made of ſuch particular Particles, but that thoſe Particles ſhould be combin'd and united after a particular Manner. Thus Salts, wet Paper, or the <hi>Oculus Mundi</hi> Stone, grow opake by being dried; Horn, by being ſcrap'd; Glaſs, by being reduc'd to Powder, or otherwiſe flaw'd; Turpentine, by being ſtirr'd about with Water till they mix im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly.</p>
               <p>The Matter which is ſeparated for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Nouriſhment of this Humor from the Blood, may from the too great Viſcidity of the Blood itſelf, either be ſeparated in too ſmall a Quantity, (the Glands and Strainers of theſe Parts being exceeding fine) and by this Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy the Humors may grow dry and opake, as Paper, Salts, <hi>Oculus Mundi</hi> Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or otherwiſe upon a Fever or <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> the Veſſels leading to this Humor may be ſo enlarg'd, as to admit Particles of an improper
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0001601100:51"/>Figure or Magnitude: The Heterogeneous Particles, (if I may ſo call them) inſtead of properly nouriſhing the Humor, may be lodg'd irregularly in its Pores, (as Water and Turpentine as above) and by deſtroying that Equality which we are told is neceſſary to Tranſparency, render the Humor opake.</p>
               <p>It may be caus'd by violent Grief, which occaſions a more than natural Secretion of Tears from an adjacent Part; this may from a Continuance make ſo great a Revulſion, that the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor may probably grow dry, or ſuffer Diminution, for Want of its uſual Supplies. I have Reaſons to imagine this, becauſe in Eyes thus diſeas'd I have found this Humor much ſmaller than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
               <p>It may and often does proceed from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skillful Treating of the Eye in an <hi>Ophthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> whilſt there is a more than ordinary Flux of Matter upon the Parts which ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat a Paſſage thro' the Coats: Inſtead of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring it forwards by kind Diſcutients, I have too frequently known it drove back by cold Repellents; and by lodging itſelf in the Coats
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0001601100:52"/>and Humors of the Eye, at once deprive it of its Uſe and Beauty.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Pitcarn,</hi> in ſpeaking of a <hi>Cataract,</hi> ſays, <hi>Some aſcribe it to the thickning or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating of the</hi> Aqueous <hi>Humor, and others to that of the</hi> Cryſtalline: <hi>But theſe know No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Nature of the Eye; for Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles floating in the</hi> Aqueous <hi>or</hi> Cryſtalline <hi>Humo, can't be prerceiv'd on the</hi> Retina.</p>
               <p>For once I'll run the Riſque of having my Underſtanding cenſur'd, and venture to ſay. That tho' the Corpuſcles themſelves are not ſeen being within the Eye, yet they can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Eye from diſcerning every diſtinct Part of any Object which is without it: And theſe little Specks of Darkneſs, amidſt a Glare of Light, are miſtaken by the Patient for Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing poſitive, when they are only Privations; and the Effect would be the ſame, if there were any Stoppages in the ſmall nervous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments which compoſe the <hi>Retina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Doctor's Philoſophy is true, when he ſays they can't be ſeen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if he would pretend to inferr from thence, that they can
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0001601100:53"/>be no Cauſes why the Eye can't ſee other Things, his Conſequence is falſe; and clearly demonſtrated to be ſo, by Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi> at the End of his ANATOMY.</p>

               <p>'Tis known by a Diminution of Sight in the Patient, and by Something which appears like a Bluiſh Cloud behind the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> tho' the Colour of it often varies: I do not yet know whether there be any Reaſon given for the Variety of Colours, but I have obſerv'd that the Green and Yellow are generally in old Subjects.</p>

               <p>If a Surgeon underſtands the Operation, and is at all able to judge when the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract</hi> is ripe for it, he has a great deal of Reaſon to promiſe Succeſs.</p>

               <p>Immediately after the Operation I apply a Repellant Compreſs, and order the Patient to be put to Bed, raiſing his Head ſomething higher than uſual; and after ſuffering of him to remain quiet a few Hours, I renew my dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and begin to treat him with a cool <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen,</hi> proper Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in a ſymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Fever: This I do to ſecond the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former <hi>Regimen;</hi> notwithſtanding which, an <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> in Spite of all I can do will ſometimes ſupervene, and then it muſt be treated as ſuch.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Ophthalmia's</hi> are ſometimes ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as to become difficult of Cure, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten produce all the Effects, and perhaps too really bring that Diſtemper upon the Eye call'd <hi>Gutta Serena.</hi> This laſt mention'd Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is ſeated on the <hi>Retina,</hi> and may be brought on by any Thing which will enlarge the Capillary Arteries of that Membrane; for they lying contiguous to the Nerves, and their Diameters being increas'd, the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Nerves are ſo preſs'd betwixt them, that the Influx of the Animal Spirits is intirely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,

               <p>The <hi>Cataract</hi> will ſometimes riſe again, even before the Needle is out of the Eye: There are many ſpecious Reaſons to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for it, tho' perhaps none of them true; however I ſhall mention what I have hitherto
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0001601100:58"/>imagin'd, not without a Promiſe to correct any Thing I ſhall here ſay if I find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by future Practice.</p>
               <p>The firſt Reaſon (which is perhaps more obvious to others than myſelf) is, That the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor being diſeas'd, is become ſpecifically lighter than the <hi>Vitreous;</hi> and that being diſengag'd from the Membranes to which it in ſome Meaſure adhered, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd to the Bottom of the <hi>Vitreous,</hi> upon Removal of the Needle it aſcends by its own ſpecifick Levity, and places itſelf at or near the Place from whence it was remov'd.</p>
               <p>The next is, That conſiſting of very gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Parts, and being join'd perhaps to the <hi>Uvea,</hi> the Needle only removes the main Body, which ſtill remains attach'd to the <hi>Uvea</hi> by certain ſmall elaſtick Filaments; which as ſoon as the Needle is remov'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract themſelves, and again lift up the <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline</hi> Humor into its natural Poſition.</p>
               <p>If it remains depreſs'd for ſome Days and afterwards riſes again, but being a ſecond or third Time depreſs'd it continues where
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0001601100:59"/>you would place it, it may proceed from an increas'd Viſcidity in the Humor itſelf, or from a Rarefaction of that Fluid into which it's immers'd; both of which will perhaps be conſequent upon an Inflammation, perhaps from an Elaſticity in the <hi>Cornea,</hi> whereby the <hi>Aqueous</hi> Humor may be immediately thruſt into its Place by Removal of the <hi>Cryſtalline;</hi> which Elaſticity and Contraction of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> may poſſibly be too great to be overcome by the diffrent ſpecifick Gravity of the <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I muſt confeſs, if I was to give my Opinion of the general Cauſe of the Riſing again of the <hi>Cataract</hi> immediately upon its being depreſs'd, I ſhould imagine it to be the lifting up the Point of the Needle before I withdraw it very near back again to the Place from whence I remov'd the <hi>Cataract.</hi> For I imagine that the ſpecifick Gravity of the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor, (being very little different if at all from that of the <hi>Vitreous</hi>) would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſufficient to overcome the Reſiſtance of the ſaid <hi>Vitreous</hi> Humor, which is a very viſcid and tenacious Fluid, unleſs there was a Paſſage made for it to riſe again by that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0001601100:60"/>Motion of the Needle which I have juſt now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd; and therefore hold it neceſſary that after the <hi>Cataract</hi> is depreſs'd, the Needle ought to be kept ſome Time upon it, that the Fluid above it may have Time perfectly to reunite; ſo as becoming all over equally tenacious, it may be impower'd to keep the <hi>Cataract</hi> in the Poſition we would have it.</p>
               <p>Another Cauſe of ill Succeſs is, the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Uvea</hi> or <hi>Iris;</hi> the Conſequence of which will be an irregular Form of the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilla,</hi> ſome of which I have ſeen intirely clos'd: However if they are not ſo, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuch a Calloſity upon the wounded Membrane, as ſtops up the <hi>Pupilla</hi> in one Part, and leaves ſuch an Opening of it on the other, that by ſtopping up the Rays where they ſhould paſs, and ſuffering them to paſs where they ſhould not, the Eye is render'd intirely uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe Parts too, when wounded, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ulcerate; by which Ulceration, the whole Coats and Humors of the Eye become one common Maſs of <hi>Pus,</hi> and the Eye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſinks.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0001601100:61"/>
               <p>The Reaſon that a Perſon is oblig'd to wound the <hi>Uvea</hi> and <hi>Iris</hi> is, when he would endeavour to remove a Film which lies in the <hi>Aqueous</hi> Humor, or on this Side the <hi>Pupilla.</hi> And this, till I know better, I ſhall call an <hi>Injudicious Practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It often happens that the ſaid Coats are wounded thro' the Fault of the Patient, even when the Operation is the moſt judiciouſly performed; for he not havingCourage to keep his Eye in the Poſition he was directed, and by endeavouring to fly from the Pain which is given by the firſt Puncture of the Needle, which he imagines is only to be done by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not being able to move his Eye any farther towards the great <hi>Canthus,</hi> turns it back againſt the Point or Edge of the Needle; and by this Means, in Spite of all the Art or Addreſs of the Surgeon, will with that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wound the Coats above-mention'd: But this laſt Accident does not happen to a Man who knows what he is doing, perhaps above Once in Twenty Times.</p>
               <p>Another Reaſon of ill Succeſs is, the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract</hi> proving Milky: To be able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0001601100:62"/>mine whether 'tis ſo or not before I touch it with my Needle I have not yet learn'd, and ſhould be glad to be inform'd by any Body who has.</p>
               <p>Another Cauſe of ill Succeſs, which is alſo ſometimes attributed to the Surgeon, may be a ſtrange Fondneſs of Sight, which engages the Patient after having been couch'd Three or Four Days to pull off the Dreſſings in the Abſence of the Surgeon; by which he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Eye to the Aſſaults of the open Air, brings on that <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> which we were endeavouring to prevent: In this Caſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is blamable, and not the Surgeon, for all the ill Conſequences that may attend it, one of which I have found often to be the intire Loſs of Sight.</p>
               <p>Another Misfortune, which too frequently attends the unhappy Patient, is, when the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taract</hi> is accompanied with a <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi> perhaps of as long ſtanding as the <hi>Cataract</hi> itſelf; this we find when upon depreſſing the <hi>Cataract,</hi> (and there's no Poſſibility of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it before) and the <hi>Pupilla</hi> remaining clear, the Patient notwithſtanding continues
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0001601100:63"/>in total Darkneſs: This Caſe is indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable. I ſhould be unwilling to think that there was any Part of Mankind ſuch Strangers to common Senſe, as to imagine this to be a Fault of the Surgeon; but, I myſelf have more than once been calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on this very Account: I can't help ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have been unfairly dealt with by ſome of the Gentlemen of my own Profeſſion, who have miſrepreſented the Caſes, and deluded the common People, as well as injured me; this was the Caſe of Three Subjects that I lately Couch'd in <hi>Yarmouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> I have met with the ſame Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on Account of a Subject which I Cut for the Stone, where I will undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to any Man in <hi>England,</hi> that it was as impoſſible to meet with Succeſs in that Operation as it was circumſtanc'd, as it is to ſucceed in the Operation of Couching where the <hi>Cataract</hi> is attended with a <hi>Gutta Serena;</hi> for unleſs a Man could directly look into the Body in the one Caſe, or down to the Bottom of the Eye in the other, he can be no more able to make a poſitive Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, than he would be to alter the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0001601100:64"/>
               <p>I ſhall make here another Obſervation, That where there is a <hi>Cataract</hi> in one Eye and the other Eye ſound and good, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient don't ought to be encourag'd to ſuffer the diſeas'd Eye to be Couch'd; becauſe the Symptoms which may poſſibly attend it, may be the Occaſion of the Loſs of both.</p>
               <p>I ſhall take the Liberty of mentioning a Caſe of my own, wherein I have met with ſome of the afore-mention'd Accidents. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Five Months ſince, a Patient came to me with a Confirm'd <hi>Cataract</hi> in one Eye, and a Suffuſion in the other. I found the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taract</hi> good, and (after the common Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) depreſs'd it with no apparent ill Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. The Eye continu'd clear, and the Patient ſaw for ſome Days: At which Time an Inflammation came on, which equally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected both Eyes; and, notwithſtanding all I could do to abate it, the Coats and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors were ſo thicken'd by it, that the Eye which had the Suffuſion in it became totally blind: And ſome Time after, that which I had couch'd was in like Manner intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of Sight; tho' the <hi>Cataract</hi> remain depreſs'd, and the <hi>Pupilla</hi> perfectly clear.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0001601100:65"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſervation.</hi> It ſeems pretty plain, That the Suffuſion above-mention'd was Nothing more than the Beginning of a <hi>Cataract,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor growing thick and muddy: And that this Inflammation, by increaſing the Viſcidity of the Matter ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Nouriſhment of the ſaid Humor, increas'd the Thickneſs ſo, as to render the Humor intirely opake; or in other Terms, ripen'd the <hi>Cataract.</hi> The Reaſon why I did not venture to Couch it afterwards was, an uncommon Dilatation of the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> which had been from the Beginning of the Suffuſion: The Diſeaſe of the other was a direct <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi> caus'd by the Inflammation in the Manner before deſerib'd.</p>
               <p>The Subject I have been treating of being altogether new, I ſhall beg Leave to add the following Queries, to be conſider'd by the Gentlemen of my Profeſſion, not troubling myſelf whether they make for or againſt my <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> I. Whether the Reaſon of the Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the <hi>Pupilla</hi> in one Eye and not the her may not be this: That the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0001601100:66"/>Humor being render'd ſomewhat leſs tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rent than formerly, the Patient finds that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Rays of Light do not ſtrike ſo clearly and for cibly as they us'd to do; or in other Words the Eye is darker than in its natural State To amend which, he naturally and one may almoſt ſay involuntarily dilates the <hi>Pupilla</hi> in order to receive more Rays of Light, and recompenſe the Defect of the diſeas'd Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor?</p>
               <p>The ſame is done whenever we want to ſee Objects in the Dark; but in this caſe the Cauſe remaining conſtant, the Dilatation is conſtant too, till the <hi>Pupilla</hi> by the frequent Uſe of this Motion becomes actually wider than it ought naturally to be. In ſuch a Dilatation as I here mention, we can't promiſe any great Succeſs from the Uſe of the Needle: For was the Humor itſelf perfectly clear, ſuch a dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Pupilla</hi> would admit ſuch a Glare and Flow of Rays to the <hi>Retina,</hi> as would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Viſion confus'd and indiſtinct; much leſs can we hope to have a good Eye, when that Humor ſo neceſſary to Viſion is intirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0001601100:67"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> II. Whether the <hi>Cataract</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appearing at firſt in a white Point, and afterwards ſpreading itſelf like a Line drawn from a Center to a Circumference, is not a Proof that 'tis a tranſparent Body already form'd, growing thick and cloudy, rather than the Beginning of a new Membrane?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> The Compoſition of the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor, in the Anatomy of the Eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> III. Whether <hi>Cataracts</hi> very old and diſcolour'd, declining in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and becoming angulous and uneven, is not a Proof of the ſame Thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> IV. Whether it would not be worth while to obſerve after the Couching a young Subject, if the ſame Subject is ever troubled with a ſecond <hi>Cataract,</hi> properly diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing whether it be the ſame <hi>Cataract</hi> riſen again or not? And this I think is beſt to be done, by obſerving the Interval of Time which paſſes between his being Couch'd and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of this ſecond <hi>Cataract.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if this Obſervation be juſt, and a ſecond <hi>Cataract</hi> be form'd in the ſame Eye, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0001601100:68"/>in the ſame Subject, this would not deſtroy my <hi>Hypotheſis?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> V. Whether our not being able to remove a <hi>Cataract</hi> at its firſt Appearance, is not a Proof that 'tis not the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor? Becauſe for all what we know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor is equally remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable at all Times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> VI. Whether or no in that Stage of the Diſeaſe which we call a <hi>Milky Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract,</hi> there may not be ſuch a Solution of Continuity of the Parts of the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, as may ſuffer the Needle to paſs back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards in it, without being able to remove it out of its Place?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> VII. And whether in a farther Stage of this Diſeaſe, the Parts may not again cloſe, and ſtick together in ſuch a Manner, as that the whole Body of the Humor may be at once remov'd, by only preſſing upon a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Part of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> VIII. Whether there may not be a Gradation of Colouring ſettled from Sir <hi>Iſaac
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0001601100:69"/>Newton's</hi> Theory, beginning at a light Blue and ending at a greeniſh Yellow; whereby we might be able to determine the exact Age of a <hi>Cataract,</hi> as ſoon as we ſee it? And whether ſuch a particular Colour will or will not ſucceſsfully bear the Needle?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> IX. Whether 'tis not poſſible to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a <hi>Speculum Oculi,</hi> which may keep the Globe of the Eye without Motion, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving that Pain to the Patient which too frequently contributes to the bringing on of an Inflammation? I mention this, becauſe I have ſeen ſo many Inconveniencies attend the Uſe of the Common <hi>Speculum Oculi;</hi> that, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than uſe it myſelf, I have choſe to have Nothing to aſſiſt me, except the Preſſure of the Thumb and Finger?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> X. Whether a Trembling, which I have obſerv'd in the <hi>Aqueous</hi> Humor ſome Time after Couching, does not proceed from a Loſs of Part of that Humor in Couching? And whether this Trembling is one Reaſon why the Rays of Light paſs confus'd into the Eye?</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0001601100:70"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> XI. Whether there is Room for the Needle to paſs between the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and the <hi>Uvea,</hi> without removing the former ſo as to ſpoil the Eye, or cutting or lacerating the latter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> XII. Whether, if this laſt is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, there's not a Poſſibility of removing a Film that may be in the Forepart of the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilla,</hi> notwithſtanding the Needle enters in at the Backpart of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> XIII. Whether there might not be a nice Experiment made, by placing an Eye like a <hi>Lens</hi> in the Hole of a dark Chamber? I think (if I remember rightly) I have met with the following Account in an Author of Experimental Philoſophy. Stripping the Fund of the Eye of its Integuments, he plac'd it as above-mention'd; and holding a Peice of white Paper within the Room, at a ſmall Diſtance from the Eye, he diſtinctly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Images of all Objects from without painted upon the Paper; as they would have been upon the <hi>Retina,</hi> if the Eye had been in its natural Poſition.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0001601100:71"/>
               <p>Had a nice Hand been there who would have gon on the Outſide and with a Needle as in Couching depreſs'd the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and if notwithſtanding this Depreſſion the Perſon within could ſtill perceive the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages as before, it would be a certain Proof that the Eye might ſee, notwithſtanding the Loſs of the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Humor.</p>
               <p>The Eye ſhould be taken down, and diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and by obſerving in what Part the <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline</hi> Humor after its Removal was lodg'd, we ſhould receive a great Light into the Theory of Couching, and much Satisfaction, as to the Truth of this <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I only mention this as it ſeems to me poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, without being able to determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis practicable or not.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>Before I conclude, I thought it my Duty to mention, (and in the Words of a Great Man) That as a candid and ſincere Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ought to be preferr'd to all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, I would not let my Heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
