            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>EVERAL Pamphlets having from Time to Time been publiſhed
concerning the RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BINHOOD SOCIETY, ſome in Vindication of it, and others
againſt it, the public At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention has been awakened; and many have deſired
to know the <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0242400300:4"/> Origin of this Society, and to be acquainted
with its Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, from it firſt Formation to its preſent State. But no
Work hitherto printed, has related theſe Particulars. Indeed, they have all
been ſo remarkably ſilent on theſe Heads, that, like the brave
<hi>Iriſhman,</hi> who, born of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proſtitute, and unable to learn
who was his real Father, concluded he had none at all, many People imagine,
either that this Society had no Origin, or that it is ſo obſcure and
uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that no Traces of it can now be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>BUT this is a Miſtake. A true and impartial Review of theſe 
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0242400300:5"/> Particulars may be expected in theſe Memoirs; and it is
not doubted, but it will amply gratify the Curioſity of the Reader. If he
deſires to know from whence theſe Materials have been drawn, I ſhall
inform him, that they were from Manuſcripts of my Grandfather and Father; the
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of whom was not only a Member, but the Promoter of 
<q rend="inline">"THE SOCIETIE FOR FREE AND CANDYD ENQUIRIE,"</q>
for ſo were they at firſt called; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they have retained the Title
ever ſince.</p>
            <p>AS to the Hiſtory of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY, for
1764, that, indeed, is intirely <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0242400300:6"/> my own Work. I have been
obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to no one for Anecdotes, but to the Members themſelves; and I have,
with no ſmall Pains and Induſtry, as well as Time and Expence, collected
from them ſuch Accounts as the Reader will here meet with. Indeed, in a Work
of this Nature, ſome Anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, not founded on Facts, muſt be expected;
Anecdotes invented by the Envy or Vanity of the Relater. But it is hoped, the
Number of theſe is but few: For the Author, or rather Compiler, has, when he
ſuſpected the Truth of any Relation, not contented himſelf with having
ſomething new to ſay, as too many of our Biographers and Hiſtory-Writers 
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0242400300:7"/> do; but has made the moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Enquiries of
different People, to whom the ſeveral Members were intimately known, and
ſome as School-fellows; and from them he has learnt their real
<hi>Parentage</hi> and <hi>Education, Life, Character</hi> and
<hi>Behaviour:</hi> So that, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, theſe Memoirs may be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as
authentic and genuine, as, perhaps, any that have been ever given to the World,
though they may not be ſo gaudily dreſſed.</p>
            <p>THE Speeches I have given on different Subjects, as Specimens of
the Members Abilities, are, in the ſtrict Senſe of the Word,
<hi>Original;</hi> for they were taken <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0242400300:8"/> down in Short-Hand,
at the very Time they were ſpoken.</p>
            <p>THE Reader may now diſcern what he has to expect in this Work.
And, without the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Vanity, I think I may affirm, that the Public
will be both inſtructed and entertained in the Peruſal of it. The ROBINHOOD
SOCIETY has, of late, greatly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Notice of the World; and is now
ſo much frequented, that, almoſt every <hi>Monday</hi> Night, Numbers are
robbed of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment they expect, becauſe it is ſo crowded, that no
more can be admitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0242400300:9"/> TO thoſe who have often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the
Society, and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Nature of it, the Author of theſe
Memoirs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals for a Character of Candour and Impartiality; and he is
confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they will allow, that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Debates is true and
faithful, his Portraits of the Members juſt and ſtriking, and the Speeches
he has ſelected au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic and <hi>original.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE will only add farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Work, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
no other MSS. but thoſe he has in his Poſſeſſion, containing the
Origin of the Society and its Proceedings, till it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved 
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0242400300:10"/> to the <hi>Butcher-Row,</hi> are now extant.</p>
            <p>AS then no other Perſon is able to trace the Original of the
Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and relate its Progreſs for no leſs a Term than 151 Years, (for
ſo long it has ſubſiſted) he doubts not but his <hi>complete

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Engliſh</hi> have been cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſed by many
ingenious Foreigners, as a People that delight greatly in Clubs and
Aſſemblies; which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to a ſocial and good-natured
Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and to a Love of Science. It is owing to this
Diſpoſition, and to this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for Knowledge, that there is ſcarce a
Town or Village in our Kingdom, but <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0242400300:12"/> what has its Clubs, or
Places of nocturnal Entertainment; where, after the Fatigues of the Day, Men of
various Occupations in Life, meet to diſſipate the Gloom which has been
ſpread by Study, or any intenſe Application; and, by a mutual
Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Sentiment, either in Flaſhes of Wit, or ſolid Argument,
to improve their Judgments, and entertain their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the favourable Point of View in which judicious Foreigners
behold our natural Propenſity of forming and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting Clubs; and ſuch
their Deſcription of the good Effects reſulting from them.</p>
            <p>BUT, I am afraid, that though ſome Clubs produce theſe
Effects, the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of them produce the Reverſe; and may be deemed
Receptacles for the Idle and the Diſſolute, where Modeſty is thrown
aſide, like their Great Coats, and where Impiety, Obſcenity, and
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs prevail to the greateſt Degree; where a Love of
Lazineſs, and an Averſion to honeſt Induſtry are contracted; where the
keeping ill Hours is encouraged, to the great Detriment of Individuals, and to
the Prejudice of the Community; and <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0242400300:13"/> where, in ſhort, no
uſeful Subject em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys their Thoughts or Tongues, but mere Noiſe and
Nonſenſe, obſcene Songs or Tales, and large Draughts of Liquor, form
their Savage Happineſs.</p>
            <p>BUT, however true this Deſcription may be of Clubs in general,
it cannot be ſaid, that the particular Kind of Club, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of
the ROBINHOOD, is of their Nature, or produces their Effects: Thoſe are
<hi>Drinking Clubs;</hi> this is a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting</hi> one. At thoſe
Places, Men meet to feed their Bodies; at this, they aſſemble to feed their
Minds. At thoſe, Intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is very frequent; at this, very rare. I could
heighten the Contraſt, but it is needleſs. The Peruſal of theſe Sheets
will ſufficiently acquaint the Reader with the Nature and Tendency of the
ROBINHOOD SOCIETY, and of Diſputing Clubs in general; and therefore, without
ſtriving to biaſs his Judgment, or preclude his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks by any of my own,
I ſhall proceed to my Account of 
<q rend="inline">"THE SOCIETY FOR FREE AND CANDID ENQUIRY",</q>
from its infant State, to its preſent mature Growth, at the ROBINHOOD and
LITTLE JOHN, in <hi>Butcher-Row.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0242400300:14"/> IN the Year 1613, when that fine Piece of
Work, equally honourable and uſeful, the <hi>New River</hi> was completed,
Sir HUGH MYDDLETON, who had a great Affection and Regard for my Grand-father,
WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM G********, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> being in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him one Day,
lamented it as a great Infelicity, and a vaſt Obſtruction of human
Knowledge, that light and trivial Subjects alone generally found Admittance
into polite Companies, while important and weighty ones were excluded. My
Grand-father acquieſced with him in Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and propoſed it as his
Opinion, that a Society might be formed to conſiſt of a certain Number of
Gentlemen, of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Education and acquired Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to meet
Weekly, at ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Room, to diſcourſe on Subjects that would
contribute to their mutual Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Entertainment. Sir HUGH de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
it was a lucky Suggeſtion, and he would think of it at Leiſure, and let him
know his Opinion of the Practicability of putting ſuch a Scheme into
Execution the next Time he ſaw him.</p>
            <p>THE Intimacy that had, for many Years, ſubſiſted between Sir
HUGH and my Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0242400300:15"/> would not permit their being
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for any conſiderable Time after this Meeting, and the Starting of a
Subject which had ſuch Charms for both. My Grand-father was a good Speaker,
and no bad Writer. In the juvenile Part of his Life, he had been engaged in
mercantile Buſineſs in a very extenſive Manner; and conducting his
Affairs with Skill and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for about ſeven-and-twenty Years, he had
amaſſed no leſs a Sum than forty-ſeven thouſand Pounds; with which,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a great Number of Merchants, being contented, he retired from
Buſineſs, and lived on the Intereſt of his Fortune. As to Sir HUGH, he
was a Man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme good natural Parts, heightened and embelliſhed by the
Acquiſition of the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ornamental Parts of Learning; and having, at
the Expence of the greateſt Part of an opulent Fortune, completed his darling
Project of bringing Water from <hi>Ware,</hi> through various Turnings and
Windings, to <hi>London,</hi> thereby ſupplying that great Metropolis with
one of the greateſt Neceſſaries of Life, he had now Leiſure to
conſider of other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and partake of other Amuſements, not leſs
ſuited to his Taſte, and for which he was not leſs qualified. At the
Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0242400300:16"/> my Grand-father and Sir HUGH had at the oldeſt
Tavern in <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Stone,</hi> in
<hi>Cannon-Street,</hi> over a Bottle of ſound Red Port, and, while
ſmoaking a Pipe of the new-found Plant, Tobacco, (which had been introduced
into <hi>England</hi> by Sir WALTER RALEIGH, but about twenty-five Years
before) they diſcourſed at large of the Advantages that might be reaped
from a Society of judicious Perſons, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once a Week to debate on
Subjects of Importance. For an Account of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Nature of the
Society, I am indebted to a Folio Book, which I have now in my Cuſtody, in my
Grand-father's own Hand-writing, and from which I have tranſcribed the
following Paſſages.</p>
            <q>IT was here (ſays the good old Man) that wee fully
diſcourſed of the Affaire. Sir HUGH declared the Number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that
were to compoſe our Societie ought to be limitted, and that they ſhoulde
not exceede twentie; and in fine, wee both agreed in this Point, that wee
woulde forthwith looke out and ſearch for proper Perſons to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe to the
Societie, and whoſe Names wee woulde enter into a little Booke: And after
that we had gained our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0242400300:17"/> Number of Perſons,
which wee alſoe agreed ſhoulde be noe more than twentie, nor leſs than
twelve, wee would aſſembel oureſelves once in a Week, at a Houſe of one
of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, and the next Week, at the Houſe of another, and ſo on
'till wee had been at each other's Houſe. After wee had ſpoken of theſe
Things, and fully agreed thereon, as I have here amply related, wee parted; Sir
HUGH going to a Countrie Houſe he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie rented at <hi>Mile-end,</hi>
and I going to mine in <hi>Norfolk-Street.</hi>
            </q>
            <q>ABOUT one Moneth after this, wee had gotten the Number of fifteen
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, all of whome were Men of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Parts and diſcreete and worthie
Conduct; and at the Intreatie of my verie good Friende Sir HUGH, wee met all of
us at the <hi>London-Stone,</hi> of a <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> Night, to write
downe our Names in a Booke, and to abide by, and agree to, a few Articles,
which were drawne up by Sir HUGH, which conteined all the Rules that wee would
be ſubject to, and which I think meet here to ſet down.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0242400300:18"/> LET not the Reader think me too
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial for giving him the Articles which this Society of
Diſputants drew up and ſigned: Any Thing relative to the Inſtitution of a
Society which has ſince that Time made ſuch Noiſe in the World, cannot be
unintereſting; on the contrary, it may afford greater Pleaſure to a curious

                        <p>Second, That wee will aſſemble and meet at each
other's Houſes or Places of Abode Weeklie; that is to ſaye, at the Houſe
of Sir HUGH MYD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DLETON, the firſt Weeke, at the Houſe of THOMAS VENNE,

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0242400300:23"/>THE firſt Meeting which this Society of
Gentlemen had, was the <hi>Monday</hi> ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the Drawing up and
Signing the foregoing Articles, being the 20th Day of <hi>October,</hi> 1613.
At Seven o'Clock in the Evening, preciſely, they all met at Sir HUGH
MYDDLETON'S Town Houſe, which was in the <hi>Strand;</hi> and, after
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating each other on their propoſed Undertaking, and drinking two
Glaſſes of Wine each, Sir HUGH got into a large Elbow Chair, and officiated
as Preſident, the reſt being ſeated in common Chairs, placed there for
that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>SIR HUGH then read the Queſtion to them, for their Night's
Debate; which was as follows:</p>
            <q>Whether the common Methods of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateing Youth, in this Nation,
are not very defective, both with reſpecte to Morals, and a Knowledge of the
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Tongue?</q>
            <p>THIS Queſtion, the Reader will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, was a very good one,
and worthy the Conſideration of the moſt reſpectable Society. I might be
thought unpardonably <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0242400300:24"/> prolix, were I to tranſcribe the
long Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which my Grand-father has given of the Debate upon this
Queſtion, and the many learned and ingenious Arguments produced by the
ſeveral Members; yet it would be equally unpardonable, to omit the capital
Arguments, and paſs over in Silence the Manner in which this firſt
Queſtion of <hi>The Society for Free and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Enquiry,</hi> was
handled.</p>
            <p>Sir HUGH, after he had read the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſked if any of the
Gentlemen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent choſe to deliver his ſentiments of it to the Company.
On which Mr. WHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAKER got up, and in a learned Speech pointed out the many
errors, which, he apprehended, prevailed in the then defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Syſtem of
Education. He expatiated on the Folly of the major Part of Parents of the lower
Claſs, in ſending their Sons to School, to learn many Parts of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which it was almoſt impoſſible, and highly improbable, from their
ſituation in life, they could poſſibly ever have any Occaſion for. He
then pointed out the erroneous Methods that Schoolmaſters in general made
Uſe of, to introduce Youth to the Knowledge of the Languages;
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed with great Propriety and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the various
Qualifications that <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0242400300:25"/> ought to centre in that Perſon, that
took on him the arduous Buſineſs of faſhioning the juvenile Mind, and
inſtilling the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Science; and ſhewed how theſe various
Qualifications ought to be exerted towards thoſe committed to their Care, if
any Fruit was to be expected from the young Nurſery. He then conſidered the
Buſineſs of Education, ſo far as it related to the Morals of Youth: And
here he lamented, that the moſt important ſhould be the moſt neglected
Branch of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that the inculcating the great Duties of Religion and
Morality, ſhould be look'd on as of ſuch ſmall moment, as to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
diſregarded; and, in fine, that the Syſtem of Education in general, left
the Minds of Youth unfurniſhed with real Knowledge, and their Hearts
uninfluenced by the great Principles of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>MY Grand-father enforced this Speech of Mr. WHITAKER by ſome
additional Arguments, and placing the others in a ſtronger and more
ſtriking Light. But the beſt, and moſt remarkable Speech, is that which
was made by Mr. JERVIS, who was, as appears by my MS. at that time
poſſeſſed of a Place at Court, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him upwards of thirteeen
hundred <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0242400300:26"/> Pounds a Year; an immenſe Sum at that time! This
Speech, in my Opinion, is ſo good, and the Complaint he makes of the
defective Methods of Education in thoſe Days, ſo well adapted to the
<hi>modern</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Education, that, I think, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do better than
give his Speech at full Length.</p>
            <q> 
               <floatingText xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <div type="speech">
                        <p> THIS Queſtion, Mr. Preſident, is certainly of the
laſt Importance, and worthy of the moſt ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The
forming of the Minds of Youth, and implanting in them ſuch Seeds as, when
ripened to Maturity, may bring forth much good Fruit, is, in my Opinion, of
more Moment than any other Subject about which we may intereſt ourſelves;
and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be fully ſpoken to.</p>
                        <p> THE human Mind has been compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by antient Writers, to
a Piece of Wax, that may be moulded to any Form, and is capable of receiving
any Impreſſion, while it is young and pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but when it grows old and
ſtiff, it is with the utmoſt Labour, and at a vaſt Expence of Time, that
we can imprint the Shape of what we deſire, on it. <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0242400300:27"/> From
hence we may and muſt infer, that it is the Duty of every Parent to train up
his Child to ſuch Learning, as may in time qualify him to be a worthy Member
of that Community to which he belongs: And let it be conſidered too, that
Youth is the beſt Time for doing this, for the Reaſon before aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
and alſo, becauſe ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples both of Religion, Morality and
Learning, which are inculcated, or, as it were, engraved on his Heart, will
grow with his Growth, and ſtrengthen with his Strength, and at length will be
written on the Tablet of his Soul, in ſuch deep and legible Characters, as
Time itſelf ſhall not be able to eraſe. Conſider too, Gentlemen, it is
far ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to learn good things, than to unlearn bad ones, which, I
apprehend, there is ſome Neceſſity of doing, according to the preſent
Syſtem of Education pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in this Kingdom, and which I ſhall now
endeavour to prove.</p>
                        <p> IN the firſt Place then, I think, that the true End of
Education is both groſly neglected, and manifeſtly perverted by the
Profeſſors of it, not duly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Difference of Genius in Boys,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0242400300:28"/> the different Conditions of Life in which they are placed,
and the different Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Trades they are deſigned for.
Education is like a vaſt Baſon of fine Water, which belongs to a large
Town, and to which every Inhabitant has an equal Right; but every one that
would receive the Advantages of it, muſt furniſh Conduit-Pipes to direct it
to his own Houſe, in like Manner as our worthy Preſident firſt planned,
and has now compleated, the Current of <hi>Ware</hi> Water, to the Houſe of
every Inhabitant in <hi>London.</hi> But if our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Education do
not duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Capacities of thoſe intruſted to their Care, but
furniſh the Heads of intended Taylors, Barbers, and Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, with ſuch
Branches of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as are not only ornamental, but abſolutely
neceſſary in Divines, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Phyſicians, or Gentlemen of Rank, who
want to make a Figure in the World, then Education may be truly ſaid, like
Water running to Waſte, though extremely good in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be of no real
ſervice to any one, but rather a Misfortune to the educated Perſon; ſince
the Length of Time employed in gathering Chaff, <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0242400300:29"/> might have
been much better employed in reaping Corn; by which, I mean ſuch Parts of
Education as are neceſſary for ſuch particular Perſon.</p>
                        <p> When a Perſon, like that I have been deſcribing,
arrives to an Age, when Reaſon begins to exert itſelf, and to blaze forth
with a conſiderable Degree of Luſtre, he finds he has miſerably miſpent
his Time, in learning Things which can poſſibly be of no Service to him,
and neglecting thoſe which are neceſſary to his going through life with
Credit to himſelf, and Utility to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in general. Before he can
furniſh himſelf with Pieces of uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it is neceſſary
that he diveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of ſome Prejudices which he muſt have
contracted, and ſome Things which he muſt have learnt, while at School: And
it is not leſs difficult to do theſe Things, than to gain new and uſeful
Acquiſitions, in travelling the Road of Science, and rambling in the Fields
of Learning. Since then Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, not Shadows, Things, not Sounds,
deſerve the Attention of a wiſe Man, it is highly neceſſary, that
Wiſdom and real Learning, ſhould be taught in our public Schools and
Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0242400300:30"/> But it may be aſked, what are Wiſdom and
real Learning? I anſwer, a thorough Knowledge of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the
Chriſtian Religion, and of the great Duties of Morality, and a competent
Knowledge of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue. But neither of theſe, I
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, are taught. The dead Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages only engroſs the Attention, and
excite the Care of Tutors and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters: And, indeed, if a Knowledge of
thoſe Languages would facilitate the Attainment of Wiſdom itſelf, and
mend the Morals of thoſe that learn them, it would be a uſeful and an
ornamental Part of Education to every one; not only to the Prince, but
Peaſant; not only to the Nobleman or Divine, but to the Tradeſman and
Artificer. But I will be bold to ſay, theſe Things are not ſo, nor do
they produce theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. A Knowledge of the Languages, is not Knowledge
itſelf, but a Key only, that being in the Hands of People of Rank and
Fortune, or thoſe of the learned Profeſſions, may by them be made an
Inſtrument to unlock and open the Cheſts of Knowledge, from whence they may
load themſelves with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but the ſame Things taken from 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0242400300:31"/> theſe Cheſts of Knowledge, are not only of no Value to
Men in mean Trades, or to low Artiſans, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely an Incumbrance.</p>
                        <p> NAY, we may go ſtill farther, and aſſert, that the
learning of ſome particular Branches of Literature, has manifeſtly a bad
Tendency to encourage in the Minds of thoſe Youths intended for Trade, ſuch
Notions of Things as will abſolutely diſqualify them from excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in
their Buſineſſes; for, inſtead of endeavouring to become eminent in
their Trades, they will be ambitious of being thought great Scholars; though,
after all, perhaps, the Rudiments and firſt Principles of Learning only they
have Capacities for acquiring. Hence a miſtaken Notion of their Superiority
over others in the ſame humble Stations of Life will ariſe; and the Pride
and Vanity they poſſeſs, and which lead them to diſdain their Fellows,
will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly draw down on them <hi>their</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Indignation,
and the Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Pity of the reſt of Mankind. By theſe Means, Men that
might have become uſeful Members, turn Peſts of Society, or, at leaſt,
mere excreſcences; <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0242400300:32"/> and thus is the Community robbed of
the Induſtry and Genius of many Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, whoſe Talents, if diverted
into a proper Channel, and exerted on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Objects, might have brought
Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to their Country, Improvement to their particular Trade, and Profit to
themſelves and Family.</p>
                        <p> THE Care and Attention of a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter ought to be
immediately directed to theſe Points. He ſhould endeavour to diſcover the
particular Genius which every Boy poſſeſſes; for there is no Boy but
has a Genius for ſome Art or Science more than another; and it ought to be
cheriſhed, and cultivated to the utmoſt. Many a Man, for Want of a due
Attention to this Rule, now cuts a deſpicable Figure as a Poverty-ſtruck
Phyſician, who might have proved an ingenious Painter, and have acquired
great Fame and Wealth: And many a dull Clergyman now thumps a Cuſhion, or
reads a dull Compoſition to a drowſy Audience, who might have proved an
excellent Cutler, and furniſhed the World with ſuch Wares as might have
engroſſed the Trade in that Branch of Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0242400300:33"/> to
<hi>Britain</hi> alone, which is now ſhared by other Nations.</p>
                        <p> BESIDES, conſider too, Gentlemen, that the Time we are
at School is by far too long, and too precious to be thrown idly away; which it
moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is, if not properly employ'd. No leſs than ſeven or eight
Years is thought ſufficient to lay in a proper Stock of Learning, even for
the loweſt Rank of People; and what that Learning is, I have before told you.
For my Part, I muſt pronounce it a moſt ridiculous Piece of Vanity, in the
loweſt Order of People, to have their Children taught <hi>Latin, Greek,
French,</hi> the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, or any other Branch of Literature, which is not
immediately neceſſary and requiſite to them in the Trades they are
deſigned for: And I would gladly know, whether, to weigh a Pound of Raſins
or Sugar, to make a full-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed Peruque, to cut out a Suit of Cloaths, or to
ſell a Pair of Shoes, a Man that is illiterate is not as well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified as
he that underſtands <hi>Algebra</hi> or <hi>Greek?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0242400300:34"/> I AM not, Gentlemen, ſpeaking
againſt the Utility of ſuch Branches of Learning; but I am for confining
them to their proper Learners: nor am I to be underſtood as an Enemy to
Tradeſmen and Artiſans partaking of the common Advantages that flow from
Literature; but I am for limitting them to ſuch Branches of it as may be for
their own Good. What theſe Branches are is very evident; a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of
their own Tongue, ſo as to be capable of reading and ſpeaking it with
Propriety; a Knowledge of the Principles of their Religion; and a Knowledge
alſo of Writing and Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic: And theſe, in my Opinion, are ſufficient
for People intended for mean Trades.</p>
                        <p> I SHALL now, Gentlemen, ſhew you another Defect in the
Conduct of our Schools; and that is, an improper Choice of Books. Sure I am,
that a great Number of Books now univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally made Uſe of, are a Diſgrace
to Humanity, and a Scandal to a Chriſtian Nation. It has ever been an Opinion
of mine, that without a Peruſal of <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0242400300:35"/> HORACE, JUVENAL,
CATULLUS, MARTIAL, in our tender Years, we might attain a thorough Knowledge of
the <hi>Latin</hi> Language; and we might underſtand <hi>Greek</hi> without
learning ARISTOPHANES. All theſe Authors were great Libertines, and ſpeak
of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Vice, that reflects Diſhonour on Human Nature, in ſuch
Terms, as ſhew their Approbation and Practice of it; and I muſt declare it
as my Opinion, that had ſuch Authors not have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it in the Manner
they do, the Vice itſelf would have been unknown to, and unpractiſed by
ſucceeding Ages. Were there no other Cauſe but this, thoſe Authors ought
never to enter a School; and ſurely, the Impoſſibility of learning
<hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> without them, can never be pleaded, when we
have <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers that have written on the moſt important
Subjects, in a pure and claſſical Style, in ſuch great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                        <p> THE Knowledge of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue is of the
laſt Importance to every one; but this great Branch is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely
neglected. We do not learn to <hi>ſpeak</hi> it at all; and how we are 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0242400300:36"/> taught to <hi>read</hi> it, I leave to every one's own
Experience. In <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which, perhaps, we have no
Occaſion to make Uſe of above once a Year, no Pains, no Expence, is thought
too great to make us Adepts; but to make us ſpeak <hi>Engliſh</hi> well,
which we have Occaſion to do every Day of our Lives, no Expence, no Pains are
beſtowed on us.</p>
                        <p> In theſe ſeveral Particulars I have mentioned, I
think the common Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of educating Youth in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are very
defective; and, I think, that Man who would point out a proper Remedy for
theſe Diſeaſes, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well of Society, and be juſtly
conſidered as a Friend to Mankind in general. I ſhall mention one, which, I
think, would contribute not a little to cure the Diſorders that muſt
inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enſue from the preſent defective Syſtem; for he muſt be a
bad Man who ſhews us our Unhappineſs, and does not in ſome Meaſure
endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it.</p>
                        <p> THE remedy then which I imagine would be ſerviceable in
the literary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0242400300:37"/> I am ſpeaking of, is, to
compel all thoſe who ſet up public Schools for the Education of Youth, to
wait on four or five Clergymen of Integrity and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be examined with
Reſpect to their Abilities, and to receive under their Hands, duly
atteſted, proper Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of their being capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking that
great Work, previous to their actually engaging in it. Were this to be done,
the Number of School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters would be greatly reduced; but it would excite a
ſufficient Number of able Men to engage in the Buſineſs of Teaching, as
the fewer there were of them, the greater would be their Profit.</p>
                        <p>I COULD point out more Methods, Mr. Preſident, to
advance Education, but I have been already too prolix, and therefore ſhall
treſpaſs no more on your Time at preſent, but propoſe a Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on
that Subject for our debating ſome future evening.</p>

            <p>How far theſe Complaints of one of the firſt Members of the
Diſputing Society, made one hundred and fifty one Years ago, were juſt,
appears by the unanimous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe my Grand-father has obſerved was 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0242400300:38"/> given to his Speech: And how far appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable his
Obſervations on the defective Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of Education then in Vogue, are to
the preſent, I leave to the Determination of every learned Reader.</p>
            <p>THE ſubſequent <hi>Monday,</hi> being the 27th of
<hi>October,</hi> 1613, the Society met for the ſecond Time. This Meeting was
held at the Houſe of THOMAS VENNE, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Man of an immenſe
Fortune, and great Erudition, at his Houſe in St. <hi>James's
Square.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Queſtion debated that Evening, was,</p>
            <q>Whether, notwithſtanding the Complaints made both by the Clergye
and Laitye of the Degeneracye of the Age, the Moderns are not more virtuous and
wiſe than the Ancients?</q>
            <p>IN diſcuſſing this Queſtion, many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ingenious
Arguments were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Members, in Support both of the Affirmative and
Negative Sides of it: But the major Part of the Society were for the
Affirmative, and evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the Superiority of the then
preſent <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0242400300:39"/> Age to any former, both with Reſpect to their
Knowledge of the Arts and Sciences, and their leading more exemplary Lives.
They proved theſe two Opinions, by the infallible Evidence of Scripture,
drawing a Compariſon between the Principles and Manners of the People of old,
with the preſent, wherein the latter appeared infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more wiſe, and
not near ſo wicked as the Holy Writings inform us the World antiently was.
They then enquired into the Cauſe of public Speakers and Writers
repreſenting the Degeneracy of the Age in ſuch lively Colours, and their
being ſunk deeper into the Pits of Iniquity and Ignorance than any former
Ages; and they ſuppoſed it to ariſe from the Want of a Reliſh for
innocent Gratifications, in thoſe public Speakers and Writers; from their
having been diſappointed in their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and Expectations, which
ſowered their Minds, and gave them a Diſguſt to the World; and from Pride
and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſwelling their Souls, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicating their
Imaginations, made them look down with Contempt from their own fancied Height
of Excellence, on thoſe they imagined ſo far beneath them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0242400300:40"/> THE next Time of their Meeting was on
<hi>Monday</hi> the 3d of <hi>November,</hi> at my Grand-father's Houſe near
<hi>Charing-Croſs;</hi> but I ſhould be too prolix, were I to relate the
Particulars of this Meeting, and the ſeveral Arguments which this ingenious
Set of Gentlemen made Uſe of in the debating of their Queſtion. I ſhall
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever inform my Reader what that Queſtion was, and mention a few others,
which were debated in their Turn at the Houſes of the other Members.</p>
            <q>Whether, from the various Accounts gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us in Hiſtorie, we
may not reaſonablie conclude, that <hi>Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> was a greater
Orator than <hi>Cicero?</hi>
            </q>
            <q>Whether the Manufacture of Broad Cloth might not be carried to a
ſtill greater Degree of Perfection?</q>
            <p>THIS Queſtion was agreed by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to be debated on again
the next <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Night, which was the 24th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> and
the Subject being, in their Opinion, of the greateſt Importance, and not
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, after they had again diſcuſſed it <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0242400300:41"/> that
Evening, it was agreed that it ſhould be a Subject for their Entertainment a
third Night.</p>
            <q>Whether Emulation in brave and noble Minds, and Envy in cowardly
and baſe ones, are not Acquirements in the Poſſeſſors own Power?</q>
            <p>ON this Queſtion I muſt remark, that, however intelligible it
might be at that Time of the Day, it is not ſo now; nor do I ſee what
Purpoſe the propoſing it could ſerve—no Debates appear by my
Manuſcript to have been made upon it.</p>
            <q>Whether the Improvement of our Heads and the Improvement of our
Hearts, do not go Hand in Hand?</q>
            <q>What Kind of Education is the moſt proper for a Nobleman, a
Gentleman, and a Tradeſman?</q>
            <q>What Regulations or Improvements are needful to be made, in Order
to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the great Work of Education in this Kingdom?</q>
            <q>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0242400300:42"/>Whether, if a Committee or Number of Gentlemen
of acknowledged Abilities, were appointed either to draw up, or to alter the
Epitaphs which, according to the preſent Method, diſgrace our Church-Yards,
it would not reflect Honour on the Nation, and excite a higher Opinion of our
Wiſdom in the Minds of judicious Foreigners?</q>
            <q>Whether the Stage, under proper Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, might not be made an
Aid to Wiſdom, an Enforcer of Virtue, and a Supplement to the Pulpit?</q>
            <q>Whether a Spendthrift or a Miſer, is the moſt uſeleſs
Member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity?</q>
            <p>ON this Queſtion, my Grand-father made a Remark, which I cannot
forbear tranſcribing.</p>
            <q>A Spendthrift, ſays he, is like a Graſhopper, and a Miſer
like a Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daw. The former diſſipates his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſings away
his Time, in his Summer of Life, regardleſs of what may happen to him in
Winter, and <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0242400300:43"/> not conſidering that wilful Waſte brings
woeful Want; and the latter hides the Treaſure he has collected, and which he
can never enjoy. They both are Fools, and unfit for Society; but the Miſer, I
think, is moſt ſo. The Miſer is a mere Muckworm, a Dunghill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, that
has brought together a Quantity of Manure, which, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly diſtributed,
would enrich the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soil; the Spendthrift, however an Enemy to
himſelf, is the generous Hand that ſcatters the rich Dung, that doth Good
to Thouſands.</q>
            <q>Whether the Difference of Genius, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the People of
different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is owing to the Climate, Soil, Form of Government, or
Education?</q>
            <q>Whether an hypocritical Sinner, or an open and audacious one, be
the greateſt Enemy to Society?</q>
            <p>SUCH were the firſt thirteen Queſtions debated by the then
infant Society, at their Meetings at the Members Houſes; the laſt of which
was held at the Houſe of my Grand-father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0242400300:44"/> I SHALL now take a Liberty frequently uſed
by Biographers, and other Writers, that of ſkipping over a long Space of
Time, in which nothing material happened in the Society, ſave that it
increaſed in Numbers and in Fame.</p>
            <p>FOR no leſs than eight-and-twenty Years was it continued on the
ſame Principles, and conducted in the ſame Manner, as at its firſt
Eſtabliſhment, during all which Time my Grand-father belonged to it, who
has not only preſerved in a large Folio Book all the Queſtions propoſed,
but alſo the Debates on thoſe that were more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intereſting,
or which more forcibly excited his Curioſity.</p>
            <p>FROM whatever Cauſe it was owing, I know not, but for half a
Year the Society was adjourned, which was the Summer of 1641. I have been
ſometimes tempted to impute it to the particular Severity of the Uſurper's
Government, and the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Exigency of the Times; but that could not be the
Caſe, as the Meetings were again held in <hi>October,</hi> being at the Time
of the dreadful <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacre, when no leſs than 45,000 Souls
were cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0242400300:45"/> though ſome Writers, for ſome
ſiniſter Views, or Reaſons beſt known to themſelves, have
diminiſhed the Numbers that fell by the Hands of the Murderers, more than
two-thirds.</p>
            <p>SHORTLY after their aſſembling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again, a great Number
of Gentlemen of Rank and Fortune, having heard of their Fame, and approving
their Scheme, offered themſelves as Members: But the Society imagining that
it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely inconvenient for a greater Number of Members to meet
together, refuſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them, and declared they would not alter, or
break in on their original Plan.</p>
            <p>IN this Manner they continued 'till the Reſtoration of King
CHARLES II. in 1660; and to ſhew in what Eſteem they were held, I ſhall
tranſcribe the following curious Anecdote, which the Reader may depend on as
a Matter of Fact.</p>
            <q>OUR Society now began to attract the public Attention in a very
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Manner, and was ſo much diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, and ſo
univerſally applauſed, that it even excited Majeſty itſelf to pay 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0242400300:46"/> us a Viſit. He was introduced to us by Sir HUGH, who
inform'd us he was a diſtant Relation of his; that coming lately from the
Country, and hearing of our Fame, as he expreſſed it, was deſirous of
hearing himſelf thoſe Debates which the World talk'd ſo loudly of. Now
ſeveral of us would have known the King, had he appear'd in <hi>propriâ
Perſonâ,</hi> but he had put a Piece of black Silk over his left Cheek,
which almoſt cover'd it; and his Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows which were quite black, he had by
ſome Artifice or other, converted to a light brown, or rather to a flaxen
Colour, and had diſguiſed himſelf in his Apparel and Looks ſo
effectually, that none of us knew him; and of this Circumſtance my good
Friend, Sir HUGH, was entirely ſilent 'till two Years afterwards, being, no
Doubt, ſo caution'd by his Majeſty.</q>
            <p>THIS little Anecdote throws a farther Light on the Character of
that facetious Monarch, who, as we may gather from Hiſtory, lov'd a Frolic at
his Heart, and was never happier than when at ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Entertainments, or
Aſſemblies, of his Subjects, where he might throw off the 
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0242400300:47"/> cumbrous Robes of Majeſty, and give a free and natural
Vent to his humorous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. I find that he was ſo well
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd with the Debates of the Society, that he came there three Times
more, and expreſſed himſelf greatly ſatisfied with an Inſtitution,
which, he declared, had ſo great a Tendency to enlarge the Mind, and to
refine the Taſte.</p>
            <p>THE Society had now exiſted forty-ſeven Years, and of the
Members that firſt form'd it, two only ſurviv'd, my Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father and Sir
HUGH. But it being like the immortal Regiment of FREDERICK II. King of
<hi>Pruſſia,</hi> ſupplied with new Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as the old ones dropp'd off,
there was no Doubt of its Diſſolution, eſpecially as they took Care to
elect ſuch Men only as were poſſeſſed of Integrity and Abilities; for
it was an invariable Maxim with them that none but ſuch ſhould be admitted,
let their Station in Life, Age, Connections, or Fortune, be what they
would.</p>
            <p>FIVE Years after this Time, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Plague happen'd, which
carried off no leſs than ſixty-eight Thouſand five Hundred and
eighty-ſix Souls, Men, Women, and Children. Among them was my Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, 
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0242400300:48"/> who, after being ſeized with it, and continuing
exceſſively ill for eleven Days, departed this Life in the
eighty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Year of his Age, having for the laſt fifty-two Years been a
Member of the Society for free Enquiry, of which he was the firſt Propoſer
and Promoter, and, with the Aſſiſtance of Sir HUGH MYDDLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, the chief
Eſtabliſher.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ITHERTO we have been enabled to compile this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the
Manuſcript of my Grand-father. He has been, as it were, our Polar Star, by
whoſe Light we have directed our Courſe; and if that Light ſhall be
adjudged ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to reflect a Splendor on ſo obſcure a Subject as
that which we have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0242400300:50"/> (a Subject whoſe
Original, Riſe, and Progreſs cannot, I believe, be traced with greater
Fidelity, involved as it is in the Darkneſs of Time) and to ſatisfy the
Expectations of the Reader, we ſhall think ourſelves very happy. It is
true, that we could have been more minute in the Deſcription of ſeveral
Things; could have tranſcribed many Speeches of various Members on different
Subjects, which we have entirely omitted; and have given <hi>all</hi> the
Queſtions that were debated by the Society from their firſt
Eſtabliſhment in 1613, to the Time of my Grand-father's Death in 1665. But
the doing theſe Things we have conceived unneceſſary, ſince it muſt
have been very dry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid to our Readers, a very diſagreeable Taſk
for ourſelves, and would have ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this Hiſtory to an enormous
Size.</p>
            <p>WE ſhall now, in this Second Part, continue our Hiſtory from
my Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's Death, till the Removal of the Society to the
<hi>Eſſex-Head</hi> in <hi>Eſſex-Street,</hi> when its original Plan
was alter'd, and its Conduct became very different; and ſhew its various
Fortune, till its laſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration to the <hi>Robinhood</hi> in
<hi>Butcher-Row,</hi> where it now continues to be held.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0242400300:51"/> MY Father, for ſome Years before my
Grand-father's Death, had been admitted a Member of the Society, and was looked
on as a very intelligent and worthy Man. He was not leſs fond of it than my
Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and no leſs particular in tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing from the Club-Book
the various Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions that were inſerted there, and the ſeveral
Arguments that paſſed <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> on the Subjects, when
they came to be debated. This he performed in the ſame large Folio Book my
Grand-father made Uſe of for the ſame Purpoſe; and which being now in my
Poſſeſſion, enables me to compile this Work.</p>
            <p>IN the Year 1667 the Society had ſome Thoughts of enlarging
their Plan, and admitting more Members. They had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Applications from
ſeveral Men of Quality, and great Numbers of others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed for
Wit and Judgment, for their being admitted to partake of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and
Entertainment which their Debates afforded; but ſo general an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
was deemed impracticable, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the great Inconvenience the Members
would all be put to, in their Turn, to entertain ſo many Perſons, and 
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0242400300:52"/> therefore ſuch Applications were to no Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>OCCASIONAL Viſitants had been, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, allowed the Liberty of
being preſent at the Debates, and to ſpeak themſelves to the Queſtion
if they thought proper. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint irritates Deſire, and Things forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
have greater Charms for Mankind, than thoſe they are at free Liberty to
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. So proved it with thoſe Gentlemen, who, though they had been
preſent at the Debates of the Society, were not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it. Enraged to
find they had not the Liberty of becoming Members, they deviated from the
Queſtions they ſhould have ſpoken to; and complained, that a Society that
was not free for the Reception of every one in general that had an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to frequent it, could have no good Effect, and that, ſuppoſing its
Influence on the Manners and Principles of thoſe that attended it ever ſo
great, the Public in general could reap no Advantage from it.</p>
            <p>IN this Manner the Society went on for ſome Time, and the
Debates were a mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mixture of angry Cenſures and ſolid Arguments,
Animadverſions on the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions propoſed, and Complaints of the 
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0242400300:53"/> narrow Spirit of the Society: So that the original
Intention of the firſt Members was entirely fruſtrated, and the
Satisfaction and Pleaſure which muſt always ariſe from a reciprocal
Communication of Sentiments between learned and ingenious Men, gave Way to
private Cabals and perſonal Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; which will ever check the Growth of
Knowledge, and choak up the Paths of Truth.</p>
            <p>TO put a Stop to theſe Proceedings, one of the Members, a Man of
a violent Spirit, and boiſterous Diſpoſition, propoſed it to the
Conſideration of the Society, whether it would not be adviſeable to
refuſe Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for the future, to any Gentleman whatever, that might
deſire to be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Viſitant, and to make ſuch an Order in
their Book. And he gave it as his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that without doing it, the Society
muſt ſoon fall to the Ground, by the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar and tumultuous Proceedings
which frequently prevailed there.</p>
            <p>HE was ſeconded in his Motion by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Members, a Man
of like Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with himſelf; who alſo gave it as his Opinion, that no
Perſon whatever, let his Fortune or Rank in Life be what it would, 
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0242400300:54"/> ought to be admitted as an occaſional Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. He
obſerved, that their Society was of a private Nature; and that, for People to
inſiſt on puſhing into their Company, and hearing their Sentiments of Men
and Things, whether they would or not, was an unparallelled Piece of
Aſſurance, and equally unmannerly with a Beggar, that, cloathed in Rags and
Wretchedneſs, yet, full of a true <hi>Hibernian</hi> Impudence, would force
his Way into a Gentleman's Parlour againſt his Conſent. He expatiated
largely on the Folly of firſt permitting any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to attend there who
was not a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and obſerved, that though it was a Cuſtom to grant
ſuch Permiſſion, yet the Breach of fooliſh Cuſtoms is better than the
Obſervance of them: And concluded, by remarking, that if they had, in that
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, travelled on in a wrong Road for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years laſt paſt,
there was no Reaſon they ſhould ſtill travel in it, eſpecially as they
had then experienced the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies that aroſe from it.</p>
            <p>THE many Debates and Arguments they had at various Times on this
Topic, at laſt produced the following Queſtion:</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0242400300:55"/>Whether it is proper to allow any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who is not a regularly choſen Member of this Society, a Liberty of attending
it?</q>
            <p>THIS Queſtion gave Riſe to many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on both Sides, and
produced no ſmall Commotion. The two hot-headed Members I have juſt
mentioned, were of Opinion, that no Man, however dignified or
diſtinguiſhed, ought to have Liberty of coming there; and urged all the
Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they were Maſters of to ſupport their Opinions; which they did
not do with the calm Demeanour of a venerable and pacific NESTOR, whoſe Words
fall from him like Flakes of Snow, that melted as they fell, but with all the
Fire and Fury of an enraged AJAX.</p>
            <p>AS the Iſſue of this Debate produced a Revolution in the
Society not leſs remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in Proportion to the Numbers that were affected
by it, than the Revolution in the State that happened but two Years afterwards,
I ſhall tranſcribe the Speech that my Father made on the Occaſion, and
which, he declares, made ſuch an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on them, that they followed
his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0242400300:56"/> in the Alteration and Enlargement of their
Plan.</p>

                        <p> I LOOK on this Queſtion, Gentlemen to be of no ſmall
Importance; as not only the Well-being, but the very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of our
Society muſt depend on the Determination we make concerning it, and the
Influence ſuch Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt neceſſarily have on our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. It
has been allowed, ye all know, for Gentlemen, recommended by any Member of our
Society, to be preſent at our Debates. How long it has been allowed, I cannot
ſay; but it has been ſo ever ſince I have had the Honour of belonging to
it. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage our Society derives from this Permiſſion is not
inconſiderable. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Luſtre and Character from the Reports which
our occaſional Viſitants make of it to their Friends; and thus Men of real
Genius and Learning are induced to viſit us, and by their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our
Debates, and liſtening to our Sentiments on Subjects of Importance, or
Matters of Controverſy, they are excited to give us theirs; and thus we are
mutually improved, and mutually obligated. Beſides, conſider that very 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0242400300:57"/> frequently not one Half of the Members attend, and if
occaſional Viſitants were not then to come among us, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates would
grow languid, and no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument could ſubſiſt. Thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are
for having no Perſons to partake of the Entertainment they may expect, and
ſeek for here, but Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſeem to reſemble an avaritious, covetous old
Miſer, that hoards up his Bags, and would have no one the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them.
Let us not be miſers in Knowledge, but deſpiſe the Character as much as
we do him that cloſets up his Gold. The worſt Avarice is that of Wiſdom;
and if we really poſſeſs any, let us act like the generous Man, and the
good Chriſtian, that will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to others the good Things that he
hath, and give unto him that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: If we have not that Wiſdom which we
may imagine, and without Vanity imagine, People think we have, and which they
come here to partake of, they will, perhaps, give us ſome. Ye all know,
Gentlemen, that in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of Things of this Kind, he that gives
away the moſt is never the poorer for it; his Treaſures are not the more
exhauſted: Then let us not <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0242400300:58"/> be afraid that ours will be
ſo, but rather hope that we ſhall be enriched by the Treaſures of thoſe
that often viſit us, and frequently come to us very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely in the
Abſence of ſome of our Members.</p>
                        <p> ONE Gentleman has obſerved, that fooliſh Cuſtoms
ought to be broke through; and that if we have travelled in a wrong Road for
ſome Time, it is proper to quit it, and travel in a right Road. I allow it,
Gentlemen; but he ought to have <hi>proved</hi> theſe two Things: He ought to
have ſhewn that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Viſiters was a fooliſh Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and that the Road we had hitherto travelled in was a wrong one; but he has not
done theſe Things; he has on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given us his mere <hi>Ipſe Dixit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> HE has obſerved likewiſe, that for People to puſh
themſelves into our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to hear our Debates, is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly as for a
Beggar to puſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Permiſſion, into a Gentleman's Parlour. This I
deny. Gentlemen that come here, do it by the Liberty that is given to each
Member, to bring one Friend with him; and therefore, <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0242400300:59"/> that
is not a Caſe <hi>in Point.</hi> As to the Inconveniencies that have
ariſen, and the Tumults that have been raiſed, they have not been owing to
our admitting Viſiters, as that Gentleman has aſſerted, but to our not
admitting more. And really, I am of Opinion, that a Society for free and candid
Inquiry, ought to be a free rnd candid Society. But how can it be a free one,
if Gentlemen are denied Entrance? How can it be a candid one, if we obſtruct
the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Knowledge?—In ſhort, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I think our Plan
might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and a very neceſſary Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take Place; a
Reformation that will put a Stop to all Manner of Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, and
increaſe our Reputation by the Acceſſion of more Members.</p>
                        <p> YOU experience very clearly, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that the chief
Inconveniencies we are put to, is the Want of Room. Could we but get a larger
Place, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of holding conveniently a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Company, we ſhould neither
be ſo crowded, nor would the Debates meet with ſuch Obſtructions.
Beſides, to ſpeak my Sentiments plainly, I don't <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0242400300:60"/> think
that meeting at each other's Houſes is at all proper. We put our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to
many Inconveniencies we might avoid; we ſuffer many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities we have no
Occaſion to ſuffer; and we diſorder our Family Affairs, when we might
avoid doing it.</p>
                        <p> I AM confident, Gentlemen, there is not a Man among ye,
how attached ſoever he is to the Intereſt of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but dreads the
Approach of that <hi>Monday,</hi> when, perhaps, no leſs than fifty People
are to aſſemble; and ſome of us perfectly tremble at it. For my Part, I
muſt conteſs, that on the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Evening the Society meets at my
Houſe, I am the unhappieſt Creature imaginable; my Wife diſlikes it, and
my Servants deteſt it. I doubt not but this is the Caſe with ye all,
Gentlemen, though your Reſpect for the Society, and for one another, has
prevented your making Mention of it. The Method of Meeting at each other's
Houſes might be extremely proper for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in its Infancy; but I don't
appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it is ſo now. The ſame Reaſons do not now exiſt as might
then; and <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0242400300:61"/> therefore we are not under the ſame Obligation
to follow the ſame Method of Procedure in this Reſpect.</p>
                        <p>WHEN this Society was firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which was
fifty-three Years ago, there were only fifteen Members that compoſed it; and
no more were added to it for ſome conſiderable Time. No Member then brought
a Friend with him; ſo that the Society might then be, with great Propriety,
ſtiled a private one. But that is not the Caſe now. Our Number of
eſtabliſhed Members doubles theirs, and the Number of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
Viſitants that come among us, allowing for the Abſence of ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
every <hi>Monday</hi> Night, at leaſt trebles it. The Inconveniency that
ſuch a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People occaſion to a Family I have before ſet forth;
and therefore ſhall now deliver it as my Opinion, that this is a Grievance
that wants a ſpeedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and demands our Attention much more than,
whether it is proper to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Gentlemen, not Members of our Society, a Liberty
of attending it.</p>
                     </div>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
            </q>
            <p>This Speech was received with univerſal Applauſe. Even the
Gentlemen that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0242400300:62"/> my Father in the former Part of
his Speech, could not but join with him in the latter; and they all came to a
Reſolution, that their meeting at one another's Houſes to debate, threw
their Families into great Confuſion, was improper in itſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
an Alteration.</p>
            <p>IN Conſequence of this Opinion, the Society came to a
Determination, of having their Meetings at ſome Tavern or Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
where they might be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Room ſufficient to hold a large
Number of Gentlemen, and where every one, whoſe Curioſity excited him to
attend the Debates, might have a Liberty of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.</p>
            <p>IT may eaſily be imagined, that in a City like <hi>London,</hi>
it could not be a very long Time before a Houſe poſſeſſed of ſuch a
Room was diſcovered. Indeed, many ſuch occurred to the Minds of the
Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but that which ſeemed moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and beſt adapted to
their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was the <hi>Eſſex-Head</hi> in
<hi>Eſſex-Street.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO this Houſe, therefore, ſeveral of the Members went; and
having examined it very attentively, reported to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, 
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0242400300:63"/> on their Return, that it would, with ſome Alterations,
anſwer their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe extremely well; that they had ſpoken to the
Landlord concerning it; and that he had promiſed to do every Thing in his
Power to make it agreeable to them.</p>
            <p>THE Society received this Account with general Approbation; and
informing the Landlord of the Nature of their Club, he fitted up the largeſt
Room in his Houſe, fixing Benches therein, ſo as to make it contain upwards
of an hundred Perſons.</p>
            <p>THE Rules and Orders the Society had before obſerved, were now
altered. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> every Member had, in his Turn, defray'd the whole
Expence attendant on the Meeting held at his Houſe; but <hi>now,</hi> they
ordered, that every Member, and every Perſon that came to the Society to hear
their Debates, ſhould, previous to his Admiſſion into the Club-Room, take
a Ticket at the Bar, for which he ſhould pay Six-pence: That every Six-pence
ſo paid would be received by the Landlord; in Conſideration of which, he
ſhould furniſh them with as much <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Lemonade</hi> as
would amount to the Sum total recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: That the Price of both thoſe Kinds 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0242400300:64"/> of Liquors ſhould be rated at Four-pence a Pot: That if
any Gentleman choſe other Liquors, he ſhould pay for them ſeparately: And
that if any Money remained in the Landlord's Hands, after he had deducted, from
the whole Money received, the Price of the Porter and Lemonade he had
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Society with, it ſhould be paid to his Servants, in
proportionable Shares, in Conſideration of the Trouble they were put to.</p>
            <p>THEY likewiſe formed ſome new Rules with Reſpect to the
Conduct of the Society, and their Methods of Debate; of which the following are
the moſt remarkable.</p>

               </floatingText>
            </q>
            <p>THESE are the moſt material new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations which the Society
made on their removing to the <hi>Eſſex-Head,</hi> their other Rules and
Orders being the ſame as before.</p>
            <p>IT is impoſſible to conceive what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of People attended
the Society as ſoon as it was declared a free one, and Liberty was given to
every Perſon to enter it, on pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Six-pence. No one Topic for
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſo univerſally prevailed as this. It became a general
Subject of Debate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors, as much as Philoſophy, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſics, and
the <hi>Belles Lettres</hi> did within. From the Courtier down to the
Peaſant, from the hoary Sage down to the playful School-boy, Curioſity had
extended her Influence, and excited Deſires in every <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0242400300:67"/> one
to viſit an Aſſembly of Men that had rendered themſelves ſo
famous.</p>
            <p>IN Conſequence of ſuch an univerſal and eager Curioſity,
Multitudes of People aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at the <hi>Eſſex-Head</hi> every
<hi>Monday</hi> Night, ſome as Orators, and ſome as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors; ſome to be
inſtructed, ſome to be entertained; ſome to ſee, and ſome to be
ſeen; ſome to ſhew their fine Cloaths, and delicate Perſons; and ſome
to criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Speeches of the <hi>Eſſex-Head</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and
entertain their Miſtreſſes with an Account of the Debates, and diſplay
their own Sagacity in diſtinguiſhing their Merits, and their Defects.</p>
            <p>IT is not more wonderful for Critics to congregate at ſuch
Places, than for Rooks and Jackdaws to meet in the Fields of human Slaughter. A
Critic that has not the Power of ſpeaking a ſingle Sentence in Public, is
yet able to diſſect the fineſt Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the fineſt Orators; he can
dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Graces of Elocution and Action, and exaggerate little Defects,
with all the petulance of Pedantry, and Rage of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0242400300:68"/> SUCH Critics are like Eunuchs: They have not
Vigour nor Courage to act man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully themſelves, and they envy and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thoſe that do. When they come into a public Aſſembly, it is not to
partake of its Entertainments, but to ſeek Occaſions of finding Fault, and
giving an ill-natured Turn to the moſt harmleſs Amuſements. They are like
ſo many Hounds at a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, devouring their Prey as faſt as they can,
and growling all the Time they are eating.</p>
            <p>THERE was likewiſe a Number of theſe Gentlemen of a higher
Claſs, the Writing Critics, who attended the Society, in Search of freſh
Topics to exerciſe their Abilities, and amuſe the Public. They knew that
the Paſſion for Novelties muſt be gratified; and when almoſt every
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject had been exhauſted, and every Field been ſo much traverſed, as
to render the Whole a common, beaten, and highway Path, it was neceſſary
for thoſe Sportſmen to turn out of the common Road, where nothing but
common Objects, and Things that have been a thouſand Times deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, meet
the Eye, and ſtrike into bye Lanes and covert Places, where, perhaps, 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0242400300:69"/> Plenty of original and curious Game might he ſtarted,
hunted down with Sport and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and be at length cooked, and ſerved
up as a choice Diſh for the public Taſte.</p>
            <p>THIS was the Caſe of the <hi>Eſſex Head</hi> Society. While
it was confined within the Bounds of each Member's Houſe, the Public in
general knew but little of it, and the venal Authors of thoſe Days, not
having Intimacy and Intereſt enough with any of the Members to gain
Admittance, were of Courſe diſabled from informing the World of the Nature
of the Society, and ſignalizing themſelves, by ſtriking into a new
Species of Writing, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Public with a new Subject. Not but of
late Years the Race of Writing-Critics is greatly improved. Formerly, thoſe
Votaries of Dullneſs never attempted to write on Subjects of which they had
no Knowledge; but now, grown more vivacious, and cultivating the finer Powers
of Imagination, they can traduce Men whom they never knew, refute Arguments
they do not underſtand, and pronounce Sentence on Books they have not
read.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Writing-Critics of the preſent Age, are ſo
ſagacious, that even the raw <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0242400300:70"/> and undiſciplined can
form a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every new Production, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the firſt
ten Lines; and as to <hi>Veterans,</hi> the Cooks of Monthly Haſhes for the
public Palate, they can diſcover an Author by his <hi>Style,</hi> and of
Courſe know, in ten Minutes, whether they are to praiſe or cenſure his
Piece: Though, indeed, to their Credit it muſt be obſerv'd, that they are
not abſolute Slaves to malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Obduracy; for, after they have vowed to
damn a Work and its Author to Contempt and Obſcurity, a Beef-Steak and a
Bottle of Wine have had a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Efficacy in ſoftening the Severity of
their Diſpoſitions, making them adore and cheriſh that very Work, which,
without the Interpoſition and Agency of the Wine and the Beef, they would
have butchered without Decency, and devoured without Remorſe.</p>
            <p>SO much for Critics of every Species.—I ſhall now return
to my Hiſtory, and as I am too poor to give a Beef-Steak and a Bottle to
ſecure it from the Reviewer's Place of Torment, it muſt of Courſe be
—, but no Matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0242400300:71"/> AS the Society was now declared to be free,
and Religion and Politics, thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible Topics of Converſation,
were allowed to be handled, the Room was crowded every Night, and Orators, like
Muſhrooms in a foggy Morning, ſtarted up from every Seat. The Excluſion
of theſe Subjects from their Debates before, had, in the general Opinion of
the Society, robbed them of much Entertainment and Knowledge. They, therefore,
departed from the Maxims of the original Members, who had declared, that the
Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being of Divine Original, could not but be pure and holy,
and therefore not a fit Object for the Debates of Diſputing Clubs; and that
for Philoſophers and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Men, who wanted only to cultivate their
rational Faculties by the Diſcuſſion of uſeful Subjects, to wade into
the Depths of Politics, and to take on them the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſcrutinizing into
the Meaſures of State, would be an unwarrantable Action, and productive of no
Good.</p>
            <p>NAY, as it is uſual not only with private Men, but with public
Aſſemblies, to run into Extremes; ſo our Society now deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0242400300:72"/> very few Queſtions, but what were religious, or
political.</p>
            <p>TRUE Religion, they obſerved, like Silver ſeven Times purified
in the Fire, appear'd the brighter the more it was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined into; and it was
the indiſpenſible Duty of every Man, to ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to
endeavour to give an Anſwer to him that aſketh a Reaſon for the Hope that
is in him. Nay, without doing it, every Man muſt be extremely criminal;
ſince, if the only Reaſon a Man can give for his being of any particular
Perſuaſion with Reſpect to his Religious Principles, is, that his Father
and Mother were of the ſame Religion <hi>he was,</hi> and that he
profeſſed that Religion, becauſe he was educated in it; then, by a Parity
of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a <hi>Hottentot,</hi> or a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> or
a <hi>Pagan,</hi> has as ſtrong Reaſons for his Mode of Religious
Worſhip, and is as juſtifiable in the Continuance of it, as the
Chriſtian. As to the ſeeming Impropriety of debating on Religion in a
Public Houſe, and examining into its Principles over a Pot of Beer, they
concluded, it was not only warrantable, but laudable, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better
than doing it in private <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0242400300:73"/> Houſes, where they could not
have an Opportunity to inſtruct their Minds and refreſh their Bodies at the
ſame Time: For they inſiſted, that in all Debates whatever, more
eſpecially on Religion, the Converſation grows languid and inſipid, in
Proportion as the Speakers grow hungry and thirſty; and therefore, a Welch
Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and a Pot of Beer, were as neceſſary Requiſites for a
profeſſed Orator, as Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Elocution, or even a Subject to
harangue on.</p>
            <p>AS to the Admiſſion of Political Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they
obſerv'd, that in this Land of Liberty, where the Goddeſs herſelf reigns
with ſo much Luſtre, and infuſes her chearing Influence into every
Breaſt, it is abſolutely neceſſary for every one who has the Good of
his Country at Heart, to ſcrutinize into, and examine the Meaſures which
are from Time to Time taken by our State Pilots, in the Management of, and
ſteering the Political Veſſel: That it is a Duty incumbent on every Man
in a free State, in a Rank of Life, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Abilities beyond
the Vulgar, to fathom the Depths of Government, and to point out and expoſe
the hidden Rocks <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0242400300:74"/> and dangerous Shoals, on which
Stateſmen often ſplit: That as we are all Links of one great Chain, we are
all intereſted in the Fate of each other, and bound by the moſt ſolemn
Ties of doing our utmoſt, for the Support and Welfare of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to
which we belong: And, that though to direct the Helm of State requires an able
Head and an incorrupt Heart, Practice and Experience, Courage and Prudence;
yet, it has been found, that as a Pigmy mounted on the Shoulders of a Giant,
may be able to ſee farther than the Giant himſelf, ſo People not
converſant with State Affairs, may ſtrike out ſome Road, that, being
purſued, may lead to Glory and Happineſs, and make ſome Obſervations,
of which thoſe that have the Direction of public Affairs, may avail
themſelves.</p>
            <p>FOR theſe, and ſome other Reaſons <hi>equally</hi> cogent,
they determined, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Politics ſhould find a Place in their
Debates, and employ their Attention as much as any other Subjects.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Queſtion they had of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Nature, was the
following; which the Reader will perceive was as ingenious <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0242400300:75"/>
as it was modeſt, highly emblematical of that Freedom of Enquiry which
afterwards prevailed in that free Society.</p>
            <q>Whether Faith and Belief are not one and the ſame Thing? And, if
ſo, Whether it is in the leaſt meritorious to believe what we cannot help
upon the Conviction of the Senſes? 
<bibl>ANTI-FIDELIS.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>MANY Arguments were urged on both Sides, and Religion and Reaſon
were ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to and fro by the various Diſputants, as a Foot-ball is by a
Company of Soldiers, or a Shuttlecock by the alternate Strokes of ſounding
Battledores.</p>
            <p>THE Affirmatives ſtrongly inſiſted that Faith was nothing
but a Conviction in the Mind, of the Truth of any particular Doctrine, or
Thing; that we could not help, from the internal Evidence we have of Things, to
believe or diſbelieve them; that in Conſequence of our examining them, we
form our Opinion, or in other Words, our Faith; and that ſince the Evidence
produced within every Man's Mind, is more or leſs forcible, in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as
it ſtrikes the Imagination, it is no <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0242400300:76"/> Wonder that the
Opinion, or Faith of Mankind, ſhould be ſo greatly different, and that one
ſhould firmly believe what another ſo ſtrenuouſly denies. They
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that if a Man did all in his Power to arrive at a due Knowledge of
Things, and in Conſequence of his gaining the beſt Information he could,
grounded his Belief, he was not culpable, let that Belief be what it would; but
any one that ſits down contented with Things as he finds them, and believes
them without a free and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Examination of their Nature and Tendency, is
extremely culpable; ſince he only believes what he has been taught, as a
Parrot may prate what he has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in. That to examine into the
Truth of any Doctrine before we aſſent to it, is our Duty; that implicit
Faith is a Monſter in its Nature, and worthy only of Papal Regions, where the
Mind is fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and Credulity and Ignorance ſtalls at large.</p>
            <p>MANY other Arguments were produced, in Support of the Opinions of
thoſe inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Gentlemen, which it would be too tedious to enumerate; the
Reſult, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of their Enquiries, and the Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they drew from
their Propoſitions, <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0242400300:77"/> were, that Faith, of whatever Kind
or Nature ſoever, was not in the leaſt meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and of conſequence
not neceſſary to Salvation; ſince it depended only on the Formation of
our Minds, and their Capability of diſtinguiſhing with Preciſion and
Accuracy, the Nature of Things, which accordingly influenced us to reject or
admit, to believe or diſbelieve any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or Doctrine which came
under the Examination of our Senſes; and that an Infidel and a Chriſtian,
are alike accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and uſeful Members of the Community.</p>
            <p>I SHALL not give the Subſtance of what was ſaid on the other
Side of the Queſtion, for the greater Part of the Speakers were thoſe who
diſbelieved the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion; and thoſe who ſpoke in
its Defence, injured the Cauſe they ſhould have ſupported, and betrayed
the Fort they ſhould have defended, by their feeble and ridiculous Arguments.
To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, therefore, the Obſervations before made, would not be to record
the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Society, but to give my own Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0242400300:78"/> ONE Obſervation I muſt, however, be
permitted to make. An ignorant Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian that pretends to defend
Chriſtianity againſt the Attacks of Infidels, is the greateſt Enemy it
can have. The Shafts of Ridicule pointed againſt it by its Foes, are too
blunted, and the divine Shield of Truth, which Chriſtianity has to defend
her, is too ſtrong for any Impreſſion to be made on it. It muſt not be
concluded therefore, that if, in public Societies, Chriſtianity is not always
defended with a cool and intrepid Spirit, againſt the hot Aſſaults of a
whole Legion of Adverſaries, that it is not defenſible. Let but the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Friends of Chriſtianity hold their Tongues, and it will defend
itſelf; but if they open the Gate to its Foes, it is no Wonder that they
ſhould enter, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph without a Victory.</p>
            <p>TO give the Reader as ſatisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Society as I
can, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to form an adequate Idea of the Members that compoſed
it, I ſhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe a few of the Queſtions they debated, and give a

            <p>THESE are ſome of the Religious and Political Queſtions
debated by the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and from their Nature and Tendency the Reader is
enabled to judge of the reſt. He may obſerve, that the moſt abſtruſe,
and the moſt eaſy Subjects, are alike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated on; thoſe that the
greateſt human Faculties cannot reach, and thoſe that the verieſt
Blockhead can underſtand.</p>
            <p>THE Abſurdity of ſuch Queſtions muſt appear to every one.
What can be more ridiculous, than for a Society of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and
Chriſtians to endeavour to explain Myſteries, to fathom what is
unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and to conceive what is inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable? Such is the Pride of
human Wit, and ſuch our Delight in reconciling Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, and fighting with
Shadows, that we neglect the Study of Subjects that are of <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0242400300:85"/>
the laſt Importance, and eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and employ our Thoughts
on thoſe that are out of the Reach of finite Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and which, could
they be explained and underſtood, would ceaſe to be myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; for, as
an eminent Divine has juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, a Myſtery explained is a
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in Terms, ſince, being explained, it becomes no Myſtery at
all.</p>
            <p>NOR leſs abſurd and ridiculous is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating on Subjects
that can admit of no rational Debate, or the leaſt Doubt. Why ſhould an
Aſſembly of Men, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Intention is to improve one
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, propoſe a Queſton, <hi>Whether Vice is Vice or not?</hi> For that
is the whole Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the ſixth Political Queſtion before ſet down.
That Vice is intrinſically Vice, in Subject or in King, can admit of no
Diſpute: No Power, no Rank, no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune can alter the Eſſence of Things,
however they may gild them over, and conceal their native Horror. As to the
other Queſtions, both Religious and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, I forbear commenting on them:
But I muſt needs obſerve, that I think the firſt are extremely indecent,
and the latter vaſtly bold, to be diſcuſſed in a public So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; to
ſay nothing of the Application <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0242400300:86"/> that every one cannot
help making when attentively conſidering the laſt.</p>
            <p>I COME now to perform the Promiſe I before made, of giving a
conciſe Account of a few of the principal Speakers in this illuſtrious
Society: But as ſome of them are ſtill living, inſtead of their real
Names, I ſhall characteriſe them under fictitious ones.</p>
            <p>POMPONIUS ATTICUS was a young Gentleman of Genius and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of a graceful Preſence, and ready Elocution. But Fancy frequently got the
better of ſober Reflection, and hurried him into Inconſiſtencies and
Paradoxes, which all his Wit and Learning could not ſupport. He was,
according to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Meaning of the Word, a Deiſt; but, according to a
true Expreſſion of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, an Unbeliever of the Truth of the
Chriſtian Religion, and the Divinity of its Author. He had an Eſtate left
him by his deceaſed Father, of ſeven hundred a Year, which he had mortgaged
to almoſt its full Value at different Times, and diſſipated the Produce
in the Purſuit of faſhionable Vices and Follies; ſo that, at the Age of
twenty-ſeven, when he firſt became a <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0242400300:87"/> Member of the
<hi>Eſſex-Head Society,</hi> an Annuity for Life of ſixty Pounds only
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. A looſe and diſorderly Life gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally brings on ſome Rebukes
of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſome alarming Reflections. To prevent their Influence,
returning Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and ſtrong Temptation preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and
enliſting the Will under their Banners, Reaſon is ſeduced, and
Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſmothered. But, as under the moſt mountainous Oppreſſion,
theſe rigid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors will call ſorth, with a loud Voice, and bid their
Maſter beware of the gilded Poiſon that preſents itſelf to his View,
and daſh the unbleſſed Cup from his deſiring Lips; ſo, POMPONIUS
feeling the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſequences of Vice, and attending to the Monitors
within, reſolved to reform his Life, and to forſake the Companions of his
Wickedneſs. But this Reſolution was but tranſitory: The firſt fine
Woman he ſaw diſarmed him, and he fell from his Heroiſm. A Continuance in
Wickedneſs debilitates the Faculties, and urges us to defend what we
practiſe. Inſtead, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of leaving off the Practice of Vice,
POMPONIUS began to extenuate it—to juſtify it—and to admire it.
He now commenced a philoſophic Rake, defended his Actions by Figures of
Speech, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangued <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0242400300:88"/> on the Expediency and Utility of
Fornication, with the choiceſt Metaphors. He was now ſurpriſed at his
former Puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity and Doubt; and was clearly of Opinion, that the
Practice of Whoredom was juſtifiable by Reaſon, that great Lord Chief
Juſtice in the Court of Man, and tended greatly to the Support of the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth. The Tranſition of this State of Mind, into a perfect
Compoſure and Serenity in the Practice of Vice, is very quick. Before we have
deviated from the Path of Duty, indeed, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ill-natured
Snarler, that Enemy to our Happineſs, ſuggeſts a thouſand Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for our Continuance in the ſame Road, and pretends to aſſert, that the
pleaſant Views, and delightful Proſpects we ſee on each Side of us, are
unreal, and a mere Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery of the Senſes; and warns us, with an an earneſt
and a loud Voice, not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Road we are in, to graſp at Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
or to catch Butterflies. Nobly diſdaining to be controuled by ſo rigid a
Monitor, we quit the Path in which we ſafely trod, and turn towards the
Bowers of Bliſs, and Beds of Roſes, where Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens ſolicit our Approach,
and urge us to recreate our jaded Senſes, and refreſh our tired Limbs. We
comply with the kind <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0242400300:89"/> Invitation: We are lulled to reſt
by the ſoft Melody of enſnaring Voices: We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Bowers of Bliſs; we
throw our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Beds of Roſes, fully perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded we ſhall there
be happy—But, ah! what Horror invades us, when we find Harpies and Furies
are the Inhabitants of thoſe Bowers, and that Adders, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and
Scorpions, lurk beneath the Roſe Beds!</p>
            <p>So was it with POMPONIUS. But of the latter Pa t of this
Deſcription he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced not the Truth, 'till Conviction came to him on a
Death-Bed—Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the <hi>Eſſex-Head Society,</hi> he was
conſidered by all as a fine Speaker, and cloſe Reaſoner. No Chriſtian
dared enter the Liſts with our Unbeliever; but if, raſh and impetuous, by
Chance any one at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it, he was ſure of being foiled.</p>
            <p>IN this Manner he went on 'till he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Age of Forty,
happy in his Vices, and perfectly convinced of their Innocence. His deiſtical
Notions were confirmed by the Authority of many Writers of the firſt Note,
and many Speakers of the ſame Sentiments, that attended the Society; and they
encouraged <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0242400300:90"/> each other in them, and from Time to Time
entertained the World with their Productions, in Order, as themſelves
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the Cauſe of Truth ſhould be propagated, and Bigotry and
Superſtition be baniſhed from the World.</p>
            <p>A MELANCHOLY Sequel remains to complete the Story. Shall I relate,
or leave the Imagination to gueſs at the Power of Sickneſs, and the
Proſpect of Death?—No; there is no Occaſion. Suffice it to ſay,
that the witty, the face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, the learned POMPONIUS, retracted the Opinions
he had eſpouſed, and declared that he <hi>felt</hi> Chriſtianity was no
empty Name, no Juggle or Trick put upon Mankind by artful Prieſts, to fetter
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and impoſe on the Senſes, but a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Good, which its
Profeſſors may poſſeſs, but of which he could entertain no Idea, but
from the Deſpair and Horror he felt from the Want of it.—Theſe Things
he now declared; but <hi>where</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared them? Alas! on a Bed from whence
he never more aroſe into this World: His immortal Spirit freed from its
Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Body, entered the Regions of Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0242400300:91"/> A VERY different Kind of Being was that
whoſe Hiſtory I ſhall now give. GRIPUS was born of very mean and poor
Parents at <hi>Shiffnall</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> who, with great
Difficulty, brought him up to a Knowledge of Reading and Writing. At the Age of
thirteen, he was put Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to a Peruke-maker, and on his Arrival to his
twenty-ſecond Year, with eleven Shillings and nine Pence only, he ſet out
for <hi>London.</hi> On his coming to this great City, and examining into the
State of his Finances, he found he had one Shilling and three Pence Halſpenny
left. With that Sum he determined to try his Fortune, and looked out for a
Place in the Capacity of a Journeyman Barber. His Endeavours were crown'd with
Succeſs: He found a Place, and he was happy. Nine Months he continued here,
and ſaved up the Sum of ſeven Pounds nine Shillings. It was a Fortune to
him, and he reſolv'd to improve it; but not in the Buſineſs he was bred
to, for he found it would not anſwer his Purpoſe. With ſeven Pounds and
nine Shillings only, GRIPUS enter'd <hi>the Alley,</hi> and took on him a
Buſineſs he knew nothing of; but he had heard that ſmall Sums had
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0242400300:92"/> immenſe Fortunes in it. He was ignorant and
illiterate to the laſt Degree; had no Accompliſhments that could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
him to the Notice of the World, or reſcue him, according to all Probability,
from that low and mean State he had been bred in, and was then ſubject
to.</p>
            <p>AS Fortune is hoodwink'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the Merits of her
Suitors, it frequently happens, that the Unworthy are admitted into her Temple,
and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd as her peculiar Favourites, while the Learned and Ingenious
languiſh in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, or drag a heavy, galling Chain, condemn'd to Penury
and Want. GRIPUS experienced the Truth of this Obſervation. With not a
ſingle Qualification that could intitle him to the Regard of any one, or
reſcue him from the ſervile and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious State he had been uſed to,
he met with great Succeſs, and abounded in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; Wealth flow'd in
faſt upon him, while Men of infinitely greater Merit were ſinking beneath a
Load of Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and patiently enduring the Frowns of Fortune. The
<hi>Alley</hi> prov'd a real Friend to him, and his Subſtance conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
increaſed. As he grew more weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, he was more parſimonious; and he 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0242400300:93"/> ſeldom or never ſpent more than three Half-pence for
his Breakfaſt, three Pence Half-penny for his Dinner, and three Half-pence
for a Nipperkin of home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed, either at the Crooked Billet in <hi>Shire
Lane,</hi> or the Welch Harp in <hi>Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's Rents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN about twenty Years he had amaſſed together the Sum of
Twenty Thouſand Pounds, with the greateſt Part of which he purchaſed an
Eſtate in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> and laid out the Remainder in the Stocks.
His Subſtance, like a Snow-ball, was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually increaſing, and with it
the Deſire of more. Like the Grave, his Luſt for Money was boundleſs, and
he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to obtain it by all the Means in his Power.</p>
            <p>ON his Arrival to his forty-ſeventh Year, Curioſity brought
him to the <hi>Eſſex Head,</hi> and Avarice kept him there. Six-pence a
Night was, indeed, more than he had made it a Rule to ſpend; but for that
Six-pence he might drink a Gallon or two of good Porter, and on the Days he
went there, he took Care to drink none any where elſe; ſo that he juſtly 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0242400300:94"/> conſider'd, that if he drank but three full Pots, he was
Three-pence Gainer.</p>
            <p>IT can ſcarcely be expected that ſuch a <hi>Genius</hi> as I
am deſcribing, could be an Orator; but he was as good a Drinker as any of
them, and though he could neither ſpeak to a Queſtion, or comprehend the
Force of any Argument, yet while the Debates were held, he could amuſe
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Tankard, and ſmoke his Pipe; and after they were
finiſhed, could for two or three Hours longer, ſmoke his Pipe, and amuſe
himſelf with his Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard—and all for Six-pence.</p>
            <p>IN this Manner old GRIPUS went on 'till the laſt Day of his
Life, the Jeſt of Fools, the Contempt of Coxcombs, the Pity of Men of
Senſe, and the Deteſtation of his Relations; though, indeed, theſe latter
being needy, paid him ſome Court, and ſhewed him ſome Reſpect, which
his Wealth, not his Merit, extorted; mere 
<q rend="inline">"Mouth-Honour, which the poor Heart would fain
have denied."</q>
            </p>
            <p>GRIPUS had many Relations, who ſtood in Need of his Bounty; but,
inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0242400300:95"/> to every Thing but the Luſt of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
dead to all the ſocial Feelings of the Soul, he cared not a Straw if his
Kindred and all Mankind were at the Bottom of the Sea, ſo that he could
ſtand ſafely on Land, ſurvey the Scene, and, like a <hi>Suſſex</hi>
or <hi>Corniſh</hi> Savage, pillage the Wreck.</p>
            <p>A LENGTH of Years, however, weigh'd him down at las;t, and he fell
ill. Death was written in his Face, and he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced incurable. The
Landlord, in whoſe Houſe he had for many Years lodged by Way of
Cheapneſs, had Two Hundred Pounds in his Hands belonging to GRIPUS; and this
Sum, he determin'd, by ſome Artifice, to appropriate to his own Uſe. How
this was to be obtain'd, was the grand Queſtion, and well worthy the
Contriver's Genius. WILL was no leſs a Miſer than GRIPUS, and had, by
keeping a mean, beggarly Coffee-Houſe, in a dirty Lane, ſaved up Three or
Four Thouſand Pounds; but he conſider'd, that Two Hundred would be a good
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to it. The Scheme being at length duly adjuſted, WILL made his
Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before GRIPUS, attended by two Witneſſes, who were to ſtand
concealed, hear the Diſcourſe, and, if neceſſary, give 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0242400300:96"/> in Evidence of it. 
<q rend="inline">"I have Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds of yours in my Hands,
Mr. GRIPUS, ſaid WILL, and I want to know what I muſt do with it."</q>
GRIPUS, rack'd with Pain, and ſcarce ſenſible of any Thing, replied, 
<q rend="inline">"Keep it yourſelf."</q> A Wink of the Eye, and a
Projection of the Hand, now were neceſſary, to bring the two Witneſſes
forward. They came. 
<q rend="inline">"What muſt I do with the Two Hundred Pounds, Mr.
GRIPUS? As you are now, in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, on a Death-bed, it is beſt to
ſettle theſe Affairs."—</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"You may keep it yourſelf, anſwer'd the ſick
Man."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Then you give and beſtow the Two Hundred Pounds
on me, don't you?"—</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"I do, reply'd he."</q> This was ſufficient.
WILL haſten'd down Stairs, had an Affidavit drawn of the Legacy given him,
and in a ſhort Time after GRIPUS expired; That GRIPUS who lived deſpiſed
and hated, and died unlamented.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Member of the Society, was Father MURTAGH O'FLAHERTY, a
Popiſh Prieſt. <hi>Ireland</hi> gave him Birth, St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s
Education, and <hi>England</hi> a good Income. He had for a long Time, 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0242400300:97"/> after his Return from St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s, reſided in
the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was look'd on as a very learned and able
Divine. The Aged revered him for his Judgment; and the Youthful for his gay and
lively Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, freed from the Auſterity and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour that frequently
make Wiſdom odious. MURTAGH would demonſtrate with the greateſt
Clearneſs, that Mirth and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs were not in the leaſt
inconſiſtent with Religion; that a Bottle of good Claret fortified the
Body, and raiſed the Spirits; and that the Joys which a good Tavern and boon
Companions afford, were not to be deſpiſed by Men of Senſe.</p>
            <p>IN Conſequence of this natural Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, this longing
Deſire to be happy, and to make others ſo, Father MURTAGH would frequent
Clubs, and ſing Catches, ſpeak Speeches, drink Toaſts, break
Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and tell merry Stories, with any one: And though ſome rigid
Prieſts, and ſevere Moraliſts, would cenſure him behind his Back for
his immoral Conduct, as they term'd it, yet, when he appear'd before them, he
had ſuch a pretty Way, ſuch a forcible Method of vindicating his
Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and winning their Affections, that <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0242400300:98"/> they could
not find in their Hearts to blame him.</p>
            <p>BUT, with ſuch Accompliſhments, if he was a Favourite of the
Men, what muſt he be with the Women? They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly idolized him, and, in
Return, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther MURTAGH had no leſs Paſſion and Veneration for them.
Indeed, there was another Circumſtance, which, though it may be deem'd a
Trifle by ſome Folks, had a wonderful Effect in forcing the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of
the Fair. As he acted in the Character of a Confeſſor, to rivet the
Eſteem of his Penitents, he uſed Lenity inſtead of Severity, and in
Caſes where ſome Confeſſors would have ſcourged with a Rod of Iron,
he rebuked with the Mildneſs of a Father, and exhorted them to a contrary
Conduct, if they would avoid his juſt Indignation. Theſe lenient and gentle
Methods prevail'd where rough and violent ones would not. The human Mind is
rather won by Entreaty, than dragged by Force, and receives Conviction from a
Friend that ſoothes its Anguiſh, and makes Allowance for its Frailties;
when, by a contrary Conduct, venial Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror might riſe to Guilt, and youthful
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0242400300:99"/> terminate in confirmed Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and
obſtinate Villainy.</p>
            <p>FATHER MURTAGH being ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Admirer of the Fair,
and treating them with ſuch Mildneſs, he had ſo won their Hearts, that
they reſounded his Praiſes continually. They inſiſted on it, he was the
beſt Prieſt in the Kingdom, the moſt learned and judicious Man, and
infinitely the beſt qualified to be a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. In ſhort, they would
confeſs to no one but Father MURTAGH. Father MURTAGH was the univerſal
Cry.</p>
            <p>THIS Trade continued ſo long, that a Conſpiracy was formed by
his envious Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren againſt his Monopoly, and by Force of Bribes and
Numbers, he fell a Victim to popular Wrath, and prieſtly Artifice.</p>
            <p>FOR a long Time the good Man, poor and friendleſs, wandered
about, a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Proof of the unhappy Fate that may attend Men of the
greateſt Parts, and of the Want of Gratitude for paſt Favours, when the
Power of continuing them is taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0242400300:100"/> FINDING he could ſcarcely ſupport
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he came to <hi>London,</hi> and ſoon formed
an Acquaintance with many People of his own Religion. An <hi>Iriſh</hi> Roman
Catholick Prieſt need never fear wanting a Beef-Steak and a Pot of Porter for
his Dinner in <hi>London:</hi> Nay, he need not fear wanting Veniſon or
Ortolans, and good Claret. There are Abundance of Papiſts in this City, who
regard their Prieſts as ſo many Demi-Gods, and who will think themſelves
as highly honoured with their Preſence at Dinner or Supper, as BAUCIS and
PHILEMON thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Preſence of their heavenly Gueſt; and
in conſequence of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Markets are ranſacked for the
choiceſt Viands, and the Wine Vaults for the beſt Wines, to entertain them.
As ſtolen Interviews between Lovers are the ſweeteſt, ſo the
Neceſſity the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Clergy are under to keep themſelves
concealed, in order to gain Proſelytes, and pervert the People to their
Religion, give a Reliſh to their Entertainments which they would otherwiſe
want.</p>
            <p>FATHER MURTAGH ſoon ſaved up a good deal of Money, and lived
as elegantly <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0242400300:101"/> as his Heart could wiſh. He attended
eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Monday</hi> night at the <hi>Eſſex-Head,</hi> ſpoke to the
Queſtions in the Character of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, yet could not help betraying
the cloven Foot on ſome Occaſions. After the Debates of the Evening were
over, and the Company entered into private Conferences with each other, Father
<hi>Murtagh</hi> would ſingle out that Perſon whom he conceived moſt fit
for his Purpoſe, and uſe the greateſt Induſtry and exert all his
Abilities, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the eſtabliſhed Religion of this Kingdom, and
extol that of the Roman Catholic, and his Endeavours were often
ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>HE is now very old, and having for many Years attended at the
<hi>Eſſex-Head Society,</hi> he comes to the <hi>Robinhood;</hi> but not
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, on Account of his Age and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>BOB SCAMPER was a Man very different from the three I have been
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing: BOB was born in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> and was reckoned
a Youth of enterpriſing Genius, and ready Parts. At the Age of eighteen he
came to <hi>London,</hi> and having ſpent the five Guineas he brought up with
him on Women of the Town, <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0242400300:102"/> was greatly at a Loſs to what
to betake himſelf. Poverty ſtared him in the Face, and tho' he had ſome
good natural Parts, and a great Aſſurance, yet having no Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he
could get no genteel Employment. His Female aſſociates, however, ſoon
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Hints, which a Lad of his ready Wit and enterpriſing Spirit,
eaſily underſtood, and as intrepidly executed. He turned Collector on the
Road, and having Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, rioted in the Spoils he had taken, and with his
Girls enjoyed all the Happineſs he deſired: Not but that ſometimes it was
daſhed with ſome Remorſe, and the Dread of the fatal Conſequences that
might enſue. But Exceſs of drinking, the Company of Libertines, and the
Converſation of his Women, diſperſed the Clouds that obſcured his
Happineſs, and confirmed him in the Reſolution he had taken to plunder and
rob the Public, and to gain a Livelihood by the bold Hands of Violence.</p>
            <p>A CONTINUANCE in Wickedneſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliariſes the Mind to it, and
what at firſt a Man would ſtart even to think of, he at length practiſes
without Horror. All Guilt is progreſſive: We go not at once, but Step by
Step, into the Extremes of Vice; and tho' it is impoſſible to ſilence the
Cries <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0242400300:103"/> of Conſcience, and to ſtifle the Dictates of
Reaſon all at once, yet an habitual Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Admonitions, brings
us to an Inſenſibility of the Horror of our Crimes, and renders us quite
callous to the Senſe of Shame, and deaf to every Thing but the importunate
Cravings of ſenſual Appetite.</p>
            <p>BOB SCAMPER experienced the Truth of theſe Obſervations. In
the Day-Time he mounted his Horſe, and robbed on the Highway with the ſame
Compoſure, as any other Man follows <hi>his</hi> cuſtomary Occupation, and
at Night he ſpent the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got Treaſure among Whores and Thieves, the
Encouragers of his Wickedneſs, and the Sharers of his Spoils.</p>
            <p>THIS was a worthy Member of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety that met to improve
themſelves by free and candid Inquiry; but Captain SCAMPER, as he was
intitled, was well received by all. He was a tall handſome Fellow, endued
with a Power of Face that diſdained a Bluſh, and though not wiſe was
witty, though not learned was ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and had a Power of impoſing on the
Underſtandings of thoſe he converſed with, and making them believe him to
be what he was not. He dreſſed well, had a free <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0242400300:104"/> and
<hi>degagée</hi> Air, wanted not Words, and addreſſed the
Paſſions of thoſe he converſed with, with ſuch Skill and Succeſs,
that you could not help giving him Credit for much more Underſtanding than he
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed.</p>
            <p>THERE are two Kinds of People that are better thought of in moſt
Companies, than their intrinſic Merit deſerves: Theſe are the ſolemn
Prig, and well-dreſſed Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb. The firſt, by the Help of a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimmed
grave Suit, and a large Peruque, a ſagacious Look, and a ſlow Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
ſhall make you take him for a ſecond SOLON. The moſt unmeaning Speech,
the triteſt Obſervation, the moſt ſuperficial Hint, delivered in a dry,
yet important, ſlow but ſolemn Tone, and enforced by ſome ſhakes of the
Head, ſhrugs of the Shoulders, and ſignificant Hand-Oratory, ſhall be
received as the Dictates of Wiſdom, and procure the Speaker the Character of
the SOLOMON of the Age.</p>
            <p>THE other, aided by his Taylor, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lener, and Barber, tho' he
gives Vent to the Fulneſs of his Soul only by dry Jokes, and inſipid
Remarks, is yet liſtened to with <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0242400300:105"/> Attention, and heard
with Pleaſure. No one will dare to contradict the Aſſertions of a Wit,
with laced Cloaths, Bag-Wig, and a Sword; and thus Folly is received for
Wiſdom, and vivacious Impudence for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</p>
            <p>SCAMPER was to be ranked in this ſecond Claſs of Orators. He
ſpoke to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Queſtion, and tho' what he ſaid had no great Depth or
much Meaning in it, yet being delivered from the Mouth of a Man that was
extremely well dreſſed, and with no bad Accent or ill Grace, it was always
well received, and the Speaker was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a very great
<hi>Genius,</hi> and an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to the Society.</p>
            <p>BUT this Ornament of the Society did not laſt above five Years
and a Half. He had committed a Robbery on <hi>Hounſlow-Heath,</hi> and taken
a Booty of no leſs than three Hundred Guineas. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he had robbed,
happened accidentally to come to the <hi>Eſſex-Head</hi> one
<hi>Monday</hi> Evening, and the Moment he entered the Room, Captain SCAMPER
had got up to ſpeak to the Queſtion. The Queſtion was</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0242400300:106"/> Whether the Doctrine of Repentance taught by
the Chriſtian Religion, has not a manifeſt Tendency to encourage
Wickedneſs? 
<bibl>DEISTICUS.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>SCAMPER, after deſiring the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to read the Queſtion
again, ſpoke to it in the beſt Manner he could. He vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
Chriſtianity in general, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that all its Doctrines tended to
the Support of Morality, by diſcountenancing all Manner of Vice. He ſhewed
its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Excellency over all the Religions that had ever appeared in the
World; he proved the Authenticity of the Sacred Writings, and defied the
Deiſts, with all their Ingenuity, to point out any Defects in them. He
obſerved of our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount, that as it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in
one conciſe View, all the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and Precepts of Chriſtiany, ſo it
was the moſt ſublime Syſtem of Ethics in the World. He took Notice, that
not only the Philoſophers and Sages of the Heathen World, conſidered
abſtractedly, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to form a complete Syſtem of moral Duties, but
that all their Writings put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether were inſufficient to form ſuch a
Syſtem, and that if all their Morality was <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0242400300:107"/> to be
extracted, that is, all their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to be reduced into a Syſtem, it
would ſtill be an imperfect one. He then ſpoke more immediately to the
Queſtion, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it as his Opinion, that the Doctrine of Repentance,
as taught by the eſtabliſhed Church, of which, he ſaid, he was not
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to own himſelf a Member, ſo far from encouraging Wickedneſs,
had the greateſt Tendency imaginable to annihilate it; for he obſerved,
that the Repentance taught in the Goſpel, is not merely a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our
paſt Sins, but likewiſe a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of reforming our Conduct for the
fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As to the Objection that had been brought by a Deiſt, who
obſerved, that Repentance was no Atonement, he ſaid, it was very true, if
we ſpeak as Deiſts, but if we believe as Chriſtians, it muſt be looked
on as an Atonement, ſince GOD, in thoſe Books which Chriſtians believe
were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by his Inſpiration, has been graciouſly pleaſed to declare,
he will receive it as ſuch. Our Duty he obſerved, without Doubt, it was
always incumbent on us to practiſe; and after the Commiſſion of the
greateſt Sins, and our ſincere Repentance of them, we perform no more than
our Duty, by living a Righteous and a Holy Life: But as the Deity had declared
to <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0242400300:108"/> every one, even the greateſt of Sinners, that though
his Crimes were as red as Scarlet, yet by Repentance the ſhould be made as
white as Snow; it is certainly a Doctrine that encourages the Soul, and
ſupports it under the Reproaches of Conſcience, that would otherwiſe whip
us with her Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and throw us into the Agonies of Deſpair and Horror.
He concluded, by drawing a Contraſt between the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the
Proteſtant, and the Abſolution of the Roman Catholic Church; and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, that the former tended to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and temporal Welfare,
and the latter to the Deſtruction of both.</p>
            <p>DURING all the Time this great Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for Religion and Morality
was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Gentleman eyed him attentively, and thought he had ſeen
him ſomewhere before. He went up cloſe to him, and after a minute
examination of his Perſon and Manner, at length recollected that it was on
<hi>Hounſlow-Heath</hi> he had the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to have ſeen him. Without
ſaying any Thing to him, or to the Company, he withdrew, and in about a
Quarter of an Hour returned with his Servant, who was preſent at the Robbery,
and with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, who was to take Care of SCAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER, <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0242400300:109"/> if the Servant agreed with his Maſter in the Identity of the
Perſon.</p>
            <p>THE Servant had no ſooner entered the Room, than, without his
Maſter's pointing the Object out, he ſwore that the tall Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in
laced Cloaths, near the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, was the Man that robbed his Maſter on
<hi>Hounſlow-Heath.</hi> This was ſufficient. The Conſtable went up to
him, and tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him on the Shoulder, ſaid, he ſhould be glad to ſpeak
to him. The Captain obeyed, and they withdrew out of the Diſputing-Room,
attended by the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his Servant. They had no ſooner reached the
Stairs, than SCAMPER wanted to know the Gentleman's Commands. 
<q rend="inline">"Oh, ſays the Conſtable, there is a Coach
waiting at the Door, and if you'll enter it, you'll know preſently."</q>
SCAMPER declin'd it, but the Conſtable was importunate, and being ſomewhat
irritated at his Obſtinacy, told him he <hi>muſt</hi> enter it. The Captain
ſtared, bit his Lips, and was mute. The Gentleman and his Servant now came
up, and the latter opening the Coach-Door, waited for his Maſter to enter.
But he was too complaiſant to go in before the Captain, and bowing to him,
aſked him to go in <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0242400300:110"/> firſt. The Captain ſtill
declin'd it, and they inſiſted on it in a higher Tone, and declar'd that he
ſhould go whether he would or not. Already was half the Captain's Sword out
of the Scabbard, and he had reſolv'd to reſiſt their utmoſt Efforts,
when a Whiſtle from the Conſtable made him ſtare, and of a Sudden
ſuſpend his Action. Immediately three ſtrapping Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows came up, and the
Conſtable pointing to SCAMPER, and telling them to do their Duty, they took
away his Sword, hurried him into the Coach, the Gentleman, his Servant, and the
Conſtable following, and drove off to Juſtice DE VEIL'S.</p>
            <p>I SHALL not multiply Words. The Gentleman and his Servant ſwore
poſitively that he was the Perſon that robb'd them on <hi>Hounſlow
Heath.</hi> He was ſearch'd. A Powder Horn, a Pair of Piſtols, a Maſk,
and ſome other Things were found on him. His Mittimus was made, and he was
ſent to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN a Fortnight, Abundance of People ſwore to their being robb'd
by him; and by means of ſome of his Girls, three of his Confederates were
taken, and ſent to bear him Company. In due Time, their Trials 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0242400300:111"/> came on at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> and they were found
guilty, and ſentenced to be hang'd.</p>
            <p>SCAMPER had very little Hopes of gaining a Reprieve, yet did not
prepare for Death in the Manner he ought. His favourite Doctrine, Repentance,
he hardly thought of, at leaſt he did not practiſe it. He drank to ſuch
Exceſs, that when the Hour came that he was to ſuffer an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Death
in the Sight of a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and gaping Populace, he ſeem'd quite
inſenſible of his Fate.</p>
            <p>HE was put into the Cart with his Companions, and they were driven
to <hi>Tyburn.</hi> The fatal Rope was faſten'd round their Necks—the
Ordinary told them they were going to another World—the Cart was driven
away—and they were left ſuſpended in the Air.</p>
            <p>THUS periſh'd BOB SCAMPER, a Man of no mean Abilities, but who
proſtituted them to infamous Purpoſes, and lived an immoral, vicious Life,
though ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranguing in the Society, on the Beauty of Holineſs, and the
Neceſſity of Repentance.—I wiſh this were not a common Caſe in
the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0242400300:112"/> ANOTHER Member of the Society, not leſs
worthy than this, was TOM RAKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WELL. TOM, after having receiv'd an Education,
that barely enabled him to read and write, was ſent from the Weſt of
<hi>England</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and there bound Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to a Grocer.
But TOM'S Genius was not to be confin'd within ſo narrow a Channel. He
ſoared to higher Things, and was ambitious enough to attempt get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the
Stage, where all his Deſires were placed, and all his Hopes terminated. He
offer'd himſelf to FLEETWOOD, the Manager, and was refuſed. Not daunted,
however, at this Repulſe, he ran away from his Maſter in the third Year of
his Apprenticeſhip, went to <hi>Norwich,</hi> where a Company of Strollers
were then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, made a Tender of his Services, and was accepted. The
pitiful Income of a ſtrolling Player was too ſcanty for our Hero, and the
Debts he had contracted were ſo numerous, and his Creditors ſo
preſſing, that <hi>Norwich</hi> became quickly too hot to hold him. He,
therefore, ſet out from that Place for <hi>Newcaſtle upon Tyne,</hi> where
there was another Company of Players: But, to enable himſelf to travel with
greater Conveniency, he took with <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0242400300:113"/> him as large a Bundle
of the Manager's Cloaths as he could carry, and ſet out early in the Morning
in a Poſt-Chaiſe.</p>
            <p>HE quickly converted his Effects into ready Money, and reach'd
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> in two Days. But he was ſoon forced to decamp. The News
of his being there, having reached his <hi>quondam</hi> Companions at
<hi>Norwich,</hi> a Hue and Cry was raiſed, and two of the Actors were ſent
to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to apprehend him. RAKEWELL, by ſome Means, had
Intelligence of their Arrival, and gueſſed their Errand; but declin'd the
Honour of their Company, by leaving the Town ſo precipitately, that he had
not even Time to pay the Landlord of the Inn he had ſet up at, a Score of
thirty-ſeven ſhillings.</p>
            <p>FROM hence he went to <hi>Exeter,</hi> at which Town he was born;
and going to his Father, told him a long Story of his Maſter's ill Uſage,
and of the Impoſſibility of his living with him. His Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a
Letter from his Maſter, informing him of his Son's running away without any
Cauſe, but of his Readineſs to pardon him if he would return. The Father
and Son had now a great Conteſt, and the Maſter's <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0242400300:114"/>
Letter had greater Weight with the old Man, than the Son's Aſſertions. He,
however, promiſed RAKEWELL, that he would write to his Maſter in his
Favour, and that 'till he could receive an Anſwer, he might ſtay with him.
The Son ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced with the Propoſal, ſeem'd pleaſed with it, and the
old Man immediately wrote, extenuating his Son's Guilt, and apologizing for the
Miſconduct which the Weakneſs incident to Youth had drawn him into.</p>
            <p>THREE Days after, TOM got up at One in the Morning, and opening a
Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau, found a Purſe with no leſs than fifty-ſeven Guineas in it, being
the poor old Man's whole Fortune, and which he had been hoarding up ever
ſince his Son was firſt ſent to <hi>London,</hi> out of the ſmall
Profits that accrued to him from a little Trade he had as a Peruke-maker. This
was a Fortune to the over-joyed Youth, and putting it ſafe in his Pocket, he
took his Stick, and walk'd 'till Seven in the Morning very briſkly, when he
had reach'd ****. Here he breakfaſted, and the Stage-Coach coming by, he
agreed with the Driver for his Paſſage to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0242400300:115"/> HE had no ſooner arriv'd at the
Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, than the Scenes he had before been engag'd in, were renew'd, and
the ſame Pranks play'd over again. While he was in his Apprenticeſhip, an
indulgent Maſter had permitted him, after the Buſineſs of the Night was
over, and Shop was ſhut, to ſpend his Evenings abroad. A Youth of ſuch a
Diſpoſition as TOM had, it may naturally be imagin'd, did not ſpend them
in very good Company, nor very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently. The Houſes he frequented were
either Brothels, or Night-Houſes, and the Company conſiſted of wild, and
thoughtleſs young Apprentices like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or thorough-paced Rogues, who
ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated the young ones into all the iniquitous Schemes and Arts they were
Maſters of. Tutors of Villainy like theſe, for whom <hi>Tyburn</hi> groans,
abound in Houſes of this Sort, and young Scholars attend there in great
Numbers.</p>
            <p>TOM keeping very bad Hours, was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently lock'd out; but after
he had the Experience of three Weeks Learning from a Veteran, he knew how to
ſeduce his Maſter's Maid, and to prevail on her to let him in at any Hour.
This Kindneſs went not unrewarded: To diſcharge his <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0242400300:116"/>
Obligations to her, TOM robb'd his Maſter of Tea, Sugar, Spices and
Snuff.</p>
            <p>THIS was a pretty Life, which he now not only renew'd, but
improv'd. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a complete Buck and Blood, ſallied out every Night in
Queſt of Adventures, beat the Watch, bullied Conſtables, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed
Lamps, kicked Waiters, bilked Bawdy-Houſes, and went Home reeling to Bed.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the Time he return'd to <hi>London</hi> from
<hi>Exeter,</hi> he attended the <hi>Eſſex-Head Society.</hi> Their Debates
charmed him, and he thought if he could be admitted a Member of ſo
reſpectable and learned a Body, he ſhould be quite happy. If Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
conſiſted in being a Member, he was ſoon in Poſſeſſion of it, for
he was choſen <hi>Nem. Con.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>RAKEWELL had a great Talent for Diſputation. He had a ready Wit,
great Volubility of Speech, and wanted not for a conſummate Aſſurance.
Theſe Accompliſhments muſt have endeared him greatly to the Society, and
he was look'd on as a valuable Acquiſition. It is true, there was no Solidity
of Judgment, no Depth of Knowledge in him, any more <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0242400300:117"/> than
in his Friend SCAMPER; but he had no leſs Art in exciting the Admiration of
the Superficial, and the Ignorant, (a vaſt Body of Men!) and in making his
Tinſel Ornaments paſs for real Plate.</p>
            <p>RAKEWELL's chief Fort was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. He diſtinguiſh'd
himſelf greatly on Subjects of this Kind, and was thought to be as good an
Orthodox Member as any in the Society. He combated the Deiſts with the
invincible Armour of Revealed Religion, and played off the great Guns of
Myſteries againſt them with no little Succeſs. As the Doctrine of
<hi>occult Cauſes</hi> is the greateſt Friend of Metaphyſicians and
natural Philoſophers, and ſerves as a Retreat for them where no Foes can
enter; ſo, when preſſed by Argument, or urged by Authority, the Deiſts
would demand Reaſons for Aſſertions, and Proofs for <hi>Ipſe
Dixits,</hi> RAKEWELL would prudently retire from the Charge, and tell them
that where Faith begins, Reaſon ends—that the Natural Man cannot
comprehend Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Subjects—that what is an Object of Faith, cannot be
intelligible by Reaſon—and that though Revealed Religion may ſeem
above Reaſon, yet it is not againſt it. Theſe, and many other Anſwers
of the like Kind, he gave to the Heterodox <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0242400300:118"/> Gentry, and
ever ſhew'd an inviolable Reſolution to defend Religion in general, and the
Eſtabliſh'd Church in particular, againſt all the Attacks of their Foes:
In Conſequence of which, the Society look'd on him as an honourable Member,
and a very learned and ingenious Man. After Debates on ſuch Subjects, and
Holy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments alledged in Favour of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, our Orator would leave the
Society, and proceed to his uſual Night Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of breaking the
Lamps, and going Home to his Girls, where he rioted in Exceſs of
Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>BY ſome Means or other, RAKEWELL had got acquainted with an old
Maiden Lady, worth no leſs than Thirteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds. After paying his
Addreſſes to her for ſome Time, he gain'd her Heart, and a Day was
propoſed for Marriage. The antiquated Virgin, not doubting the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her
Lover, the Day before the intended Marriage, transferr'd over her whole Fortune
to him. The Lover was now happy. He ſold out the Thirteen Hundred Pounds Old
South Sea An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities, and Three per Cent. Bank An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities, immediately. With
the Money theſe produced, he ſet up a Chariot and Pair, took genteel
Lodgings in <hi>Pall-Mall,</hi> 
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0242400300:119"/> and appear'd in every
Reſpect as a Man of Fortune, quite regardleſs of the Attempts that might be
made on him by the Sons of Law, and hoping to find out ſome other wealthy
Dame, with whom he might meet with equal Succeſs.</p>
            <p>BUT though RAKEWELL was ſafe with Reſpect to the Revenge
threaten'd him by the Lady he had tricked, and her Friends, yet his high Living
and Extravagance ſoon diſſipated his Subſtance, and he was at a Loſs
what to do. Paying ready Money for ſome Time, however, induced Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to give him Credit; and having run in Tick to the Amount of Three Hundred
Pounds, with various People; and being dunned, and threatened ſeveral Times
by the moſt Importunate of them, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſhift his Quarters, to
go away from his Lodgings without ſettling with his Landlord or his Footman
(for he kept one to the laſt) and ſet out again for <hi>Exeter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON his Arrival there he told his Father a miſerable Story, of
his having been rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of Five Hundred Guineas, of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Combat with
the Highwaymen that had robbed him, and of his having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd ſeveral
active Fellows to go in Search of them. His Father ſeeing him 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0242400300:120"/> well-dreſſed, and appear more like a Lord than
<hi>his</hi> Son, teſtified his Joy at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. RAKEWELL then voluntarily
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his having robbed him of fifty-ſeven Guineas; and, putting a Bill
in his Hand, drawn on the moſt eminent Banker in <hi>London,</hi> for One
Hundred Pounds, told him, he was not to look on that as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence in full,
but as an Earneſt only of what he ſhould receive. He then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of
his having married a Lady worth Twenty Thouſand Pounds but a Fortnight ago;
that he was then going to <hi>Penzance</hi> to ſettle Affairs with her
Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and would return to <hi>London</hi> in five Days, where his Lady
impatiently expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
            <p>THE good old Man was ſo overjoy'd at hearing this Account of his
Son's good Fortune, that he fell on his Neck, and kiſſed him, and with
Tears in his Eyes told him, that he was glad to hear of his Succeſs in Life;
but that he had no Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Hundred Pounds he had given him, he
having, by his Care and Induſtry, ſince his leaving him laſt, ſaved up
Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven Pounds; and therefore he begged him to take back again his
generous Gift of a Hundred Pounds, as, till his Affairs were ſettled, he
might have Occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0242400300:121"/> BUT this RAKEWELL declined, and obſerved,
that the Trifle he had given him, he could well ſpare; that he inſiſted
on his keeping it; and that in a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night he might have the Pleaſure of
treb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it to him. The old Man, filled with Joy at ſeeing ſuch a Son,
ſeemed perfectly happy; went about to his Friends—told them of his
Son's good Fortune—invited them to his Houſe—bought the
greateſt Dainties he could poſſibly procure—and at Eight at Night
the Houſe was full of Gueſts, drinking Wine, Punch, and Beer, while roaſt
Geeſe were at the Fire, Fowls in the Pot, and ſome other ſubſtantial
Diſhes provided, to entertain the Friends on the Prodigal's Return; a
Prodigal, that had been guilty of ſome Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that had been bred in
Obſcurity, and was now raiſed to great Grandeur.</p>
            <p>THE Evening was ſpent in great Jolity, and all but RAKEWELL were
perfecty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated. After all the Company was gone, the old Man, whoſe
Heart was now quite merry, went to a private Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, took out a Bottle of
excellent Citron Water, and deſired his Son to take a Glaſs. The Son obeyed
him, and the Father fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Example. One Glaſs intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0242400300:122"/> another, another followed, and, in ſhort, the
Duumvirate emptied the Bottle. The Son was now what they call half-ſeas over;
but the old Man was ſo intoxicated, he could heither ſit or ſtand. With
ſome Difficulty RAKEWELL got him to-bed, took the Key out of the Door, locked
it, and then—went down Stairs.</p>
            <p>HE began now to ranſack the Houſe, immediately ſeized the
old Man's twenty-ſeven Pounds, and took every Thing away he could
conveniently carry. He then went to the Inn he had put up at on his firſt
coming to Town, ordered a Poſt Chaiſe, and told the Driver to go on as
faſt as he could.</p>
            <p>A CHANGE of Chaiſes ſoon brought him to <hi>London;</hi> and
it happening to be on a <hi>Monday</hi> Night, he attended at the
<hi>Eſſex-Head Society,</hi> and ſpoke to the Queſtion, which was;</p>
            <q>Whether, even in this World, a vicious and immoral Man, is not
ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed? And if Virtue diſtreſſed, does not feel greater
Happineſs than exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Vice? 
<bibl>PLATO.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p> 
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0242400300:123"/>RAKEWELL took the Affirmative Side of the
Queſtion, and proved, beyond all Manner of Contradiction, that Vice and
Immorality met with its Puniſhment, by inflicting the Stings of Conſcience
at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the Dread of future Pain. Not that this Doctrine, he
obſerved, tended in the leaſt to ſet aſide that of a future
Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Rewards and Puniſhments in another State; where, as we are
taught by the Chriſtian Religion, that Suffering Virtue will meet its ample
Reward, and Triumphant Vice be ſuitably puniſhed: But the Commiſſion of
good Actions, and the Conſciouſneſs of our having performed our Duty,
gave a placid Serenity to our Minds, and a Compoſure to our Thoughts: A
Felicity which the Huzzas of applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Thouſands could not give, nor the
Hiſſes of detracting and bitter Enemies take away. He took Notice alſo of
the Diſtreſſes and Agonies of Mind a wicked Man always laboured under,
through a Fear of being expoſed, and his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs revealed to the World;
which would conſequentially draw on him the ſevere Penalties of the Law,
and the juſt Deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Mankind. He inſiſted on it, that the
continual Apprehenſions of Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very a wicked Man muſt be under, and 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0242400300:124"/> the Terrors of an abuſed Conſcience, muſt prevent
the Approaches of Happineſs, and daſh the Cup of Pleaſure with a great
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of nauſeous and bitter Herbs. He then launched out into the
Pleaſures of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion; and made it appear, that their Votaries
reaped greater Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and taſted a more home-felt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than
could poſſibly reſult from the higheſt Gratifications of ſenſual
Appetite, or mere Animal Bliſs. To prove theſe Aſſertions, he quoted a
few Authors he had either read or heard of, as Enforcers of his Sentiments, and
as Authors of his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: A great Name frequently proves more than a ſound
Argument; and People, with whom Learning and Reaſon have no Sort of Weight,
are yet prevailed on to reſign their Judgments, and to give up their Opinions
to an Antient whom Time has ſanctified, or to an illuſtrious Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Writer, whoſe Notions and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been honoured and embraced by the
World.</p>
            <p>THE Speech RAKEWELL delivered was well received, and the Society
thought no one could excel him in Propriety of Thought, or Regularity of
Conduct. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Debates were over, RAKEWELL left the Society, and
traverſed the Streets, <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0242400300:125"/> till he met with a Female he
liked, and with whom he went to the moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Bagnio.</p>
            <p>IN this Manner he continued for ſome Time, an unaccountable
Aenigma, which none was able to ſolve: But being at ength diſcovered to
have robbed a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Eminence in <hi>Groſvenor-Square,</hi> he was
tried, convicted, and condemned, and executed at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> at the very
Time that his Colleague and Companion, the facetious BOB SCAMPER
ſuffered.—Thus was the Society deprived of two of their beſt Members,
the moſt powerful and ornamental Pillars of their Fabric.</p>
            <p>FOR ſome ſhort Time after this the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was obſerved to
dwindle away, and its ſtaunch Advocates and firm Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fear that
its Diſſolution was nigh. Some imputed it to the Abſence of two of their
beſt Speakers, and the Deſpair the Public in general had of hearing any
Thing debated on by able Orators, now the beſt were gone: Some imagined, that
the melancholy Fate of thoſe two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers deterred People from attending a
So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety on which they had once reflected ſuch Honour, and which was now
diſgraced by <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0242400300:126"/> their ignominious Death; and ſome were
earneſtly wiſhing for its Annihilation.</p>
            <p>IT was not long, however, before the Fears of the one Party, and
the Hopes of the other were turned into Certainty. The Society triumphed, their
Friends rejoiced, and their Enemies were diſappointed.</p>
            <p>To give a long Detail of every Event that happened in this
Society, to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize all their Proceedings, and to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize all
their Members, would exceed the Bounds I have preſcribed myſelf, and would
be uncommonly tedious: I ſhall therefore only obſerve, that from the Time
the Society was removed to the <hi>Eſſex-Head,</hi> it increaſed both in
Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and in Reputation; and ſo well was it known, that Gentlemen who
lived in the Country, as well as Foreigners of all Nations, if in the leaſt
curious, learned, or ingenious, reſorted to it to hear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates that had ſo
much attracted the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and extorted the Admiration of the World.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Year 1747, the Society was removed to the
<hi>Robinhood</hi> in <hi>Butcher-Row,</hi> at that Time kept by Mr. HALL. The
Room here was vaſtly more convenient than the other: New Benches were made,
in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that a greater Number of People might be admitted; a Branch for
eighteen <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0242400300:128"/> Candles was ſuſpended from the Ceiling; a
large Chair for the Preſident, curiouſly gilt, was erected; a Box to keep
the Book of Queſtions, was provided; a Hammer was purchaſed for the
Preſident; and, in ſhort, every Thing that was neceſſary to reflect
Splendor on the Society, and to accommodate its Viſitants in the beſt
Manner, was obtain'd by the induſtrious Landlord, who had formed great Hopes
of adding a Reputation to his Houſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching himſelf, from the
vaſt Concourſe of People he expected would aſſemble there.</p>
            <p>IN order to convey the beſt Idea I can of this famous Society to
the Mind of the Reader, I apprehend it is neceſſary for me to give a fuller
Account of the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, than I have before done.</p>
            <p>EVERY Perſon that attended it, was to pay Six-pence; and that
while theſe Diſputants were enriching their Minds with the Treaſures of
Knowledge, they might alſo practiſe the God-like Virtue of Charity, they
agreed, that out of every Six-pence the Landlord ſhould be paid Four-pence
for each Quart of Lemonade and Porter; Three Half-pence ſhould be 
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0242400300:129"/> ſet by, and appropriated to charitable Uſes, to be
agreed on by a ſelect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee appointed for that Purpoſe; and the
remaining Half-penny ſhould be paid to the Clerk, as a Recompence for the
Trouble he was put to, in receiving each Perſon's Ticket, and taking Care
that the Society in general, and the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in particular, were duly
ſerv'd with Liquor.</p>
            <p>A PERPETUAL Preſident was alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, whoſe Name was
JEACOCKE, who was to act as Moderator, and who had, indeed, given great
Satisfactio nin that Character at the <hi>Eſſex-Head,</hi> for four Years.
His Duty conſiſted in reading whatever Queſtions were propoſed for
Conſideration, and offering them ſeparately to the Choice of the Members:
Thoſe who choſe that a Queſtion, ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and enter'd in
the Book, were to ſignify it by holding up their Hands; and thoſe who did
not think it a proper Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were to ſignify their Opinion in the
ſame Manner; and the Majority carried it. After this Part of his Duty, he was
to read the Queſtion for the Night's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and then aſk the ſeveral
Members whether they choſe to ſpeak to it, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0242400300:130"/> with the Perſon who ſat next to his left Hand, and proceeding
all round the Room 'till he came to the Perſon who ſat next his right Hand.
When any Perſon got up to ſpeak, he was alſo to take Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of what he
conceiv'd to be of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Importance, and by thus collecting the different
Sentiments of different People, he was enabled, when it came to his Turn to
ſpeak, to enforce the Arguments that ſtrengthen'd his own Opinion, and
invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date thoſe that were againſt it. If no Perſon thought proper to
own a Queſtion, or to confeſs himſelf the Propoſer of it, then the
Preſident was the adopted Father, and he open'd the Queſtion, by explaining
the Terms of it, and concluded the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates on it, by a Speech of his own; but
if the Author of the Queſtion own'd it, then the Perſon next to his left
Hand ſpoke to it, and it was to go round in due Order, and the Propoſer
concluded it. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident was likewiſe to keep Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum in the
Society; to prevent any perſonal Altercations, or mean Invectives; to make
them ſtick to the Point; to bring them back when they went aſtray; to ſee
likewiſe with the Clerk, that the Society was well ſupplied with Liquor;
and, in ſhort, to do every Thing that was for <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0242400300:131"/> the
Intereſt of the Society, and the Good of the Members preſent.</p>
            <p>BY this Account of the Duty of the Preſident, it will appear
that his Trouble every Night was not little. It is always difficult to keep a
promiſcuous Company in good Order; and a Society, like the ROBINHOOD, where
every one is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for his Six-pence, muſt be liable to many
Irregularities. But though the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident's Trouble was ſo great, yet his
Attachment to, and Veneration for, the Society was ſuch, that, unlike the
inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Conduct of moſt other Preſidents, he acted <hi>Gratis,</hi>
contenting himſelf only with the Honour of the Office.</p>
            <p>ONCE a Year a Paper was publiſh'd by the Society, containing a
Juſtification of it from the Sneers of Witlings, and the Sarcaſms of ſome
ſatirical Authors, and ſetting forth its Nature and Tendency; and
underneath it, was an Account of the Number of People that had attended it all
the Year, diſtinguiſhing the particular Number that met each
<hi>Monday</hi> Night. This was thought more likely to vindicate their Conduct,
and wipe off the Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that had been thrown on them, than 
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0242400300:132"/> an elaborate Defence; ſince by ſeeing what a vaſt
Number of People attended each Night, amounting in a Year's Time to upwards of
Five Thouſand, on a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Computation, the Public might perceive that no
leſs than Five Thouſand three Half-pennies were diſtributed in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
amounting to 31<hi>l.</hi> 5<hi>s.</hi>—And even ſuppoſing that the
Society could not vie in Splendor with the ROYAL SOCIETY, or in Dignity with
the ANTIQUARIAN, or in Numbers with the SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF ARTS,
MANU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FACTURES AND COMMERCE, and even granting their Antagoniſts
Aſſertions to be true, that it was a Receptacle for the Illiterate and the
Impious, where horrid and blaſphemous Notions were defended and propagated,
and where Religion and Virtue were trodden under Foot; yet ſtill, it may be
urged from great Authority, that Charity <hi>covers</hi> a Multitude of
Sins.</p>
            <p>THE Society now advancing in its Reputation, and ſome of the
moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Wits and Scholars frequenting it, it greatly excited
the public Attention. There was ſcarce a public Paper, but in the Courſe of
its Animadverſions, the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY was taken Notice 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0242400300:133"/> of. Doctor HENLEY vindicated it from his Roſtrum, and
comparing it to ſome of the famed Aſſemblies of Yore, where a CICERO, or
a DEMOSTHENES harangued, he affirm'd it to be of the moſt eminent Service to
Mankind, by mending their Morals, enlarging their Knowledge, and refining their
Taſte; that it was infinitely preferable, conſider'd as a School of
Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, to the Bar, or the Senate; and that it excell'd the Pulpit, both with
Reſpect to the Advancement of TRUE RELIGION, and the ſpreading of Human
Knowledge. Nay, he affirm'd it to be the Sun of the intellectual and moral
World, that with its radiant Beams enlighten'd, chear'd, and vivified the
Spiritual Syſtem, as the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamental Sun doth the Natural.—In ſhort,
he undertook to vindicate it from his Roſtrum in <hi>Lincoln's-Inn
Fields,</hi> from all the Calumnies and Aſperſions, that ever had been, or
could be raiſed againſt it, and inſiſted on its being the moſt
perfect human Inſtitution that was ever form'd, except—his own
Oratory.</p>
            <p>ON the other Hand, the Pulpits every where diſplay'd its evil
Tendency, and reſounded with its Infamy. The Clergy were ſo much againſt
it, that, Surgeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0242400300:134"/> they diſſected and cut it up
without Mercy. They averr'd, that the Houſe itſelf could not ſtand long;
that it was a ſecond Pandemonium, or Aſſembly of evil Spirits; that
though they at preſent triumphed, yet they would ſhortly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated; and
that every one of the Members that compoſed it, would infallibly be
d—d. Nay, one Reverend Gentleman in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,<note n="*" place="bottom">That very popular Gentleman, the candid, the ingenious, and
ingenuous Mr. R—M—NE.</note> propheſied, ſome Years after the
Period I am now deſcribing, that as it was abſolutely certain, that the
Merchants that were ſettling their Books at the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in
<hi>Liſbon,</hi> in the Year 1749, were ſwallow'd up, and immediately
conſign'd to the Care of the D—l; ſo the ROBIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOOD would ſhortly
meet the like Fate, or be torn from its Foundations, whirled through the Air by
the Prince of it, be carried, like OUR LADY OF <hi>Loretto,</hi> Thouſands of
Leagues, and at Length, with its whole Cargo, thrown down to H—ll.</p>
            <p>THE Society, however, in Spight of theſe Denunciations,
maintain'd its Ground, <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0242400300:135"/> and increaſed in Fame. The
Names of the Members had been written in their Book of Queſtions, and new
ones were continually added. The Regulations they were under, were likewiſe
copied out fair; and theſe, with the Liſt of the Queſtions that
ſucceeded them, were open to every one's Peruſal.</p>
            <p>THE Preſident diſcharg'd his Truſt with Fidelity and Honour,
and the Society in general thought themſelves much oblig'd to him for the
Care he had taken of their Intereſt, and the good Order and Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he

                        <head>Mr. CALEB JEACOCKE, Or, As he is more frequently
called, The BAKER.</head>
                        <p>MY Intention in giving a few Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of this Gentleman,
is not to ſurpriſe the Reader, by a Relation of uncommon or intereſting
Events, but merely to reſcue a Character, greatly traduced, and viely
miſrepreſented, by all the Authors, as far as I have ſeen, who have
employ'd their Pens on this Subject.</p>
                        <p>IN the Lives of the Generality of Men, there is nothing
remarkable enough to ſatisfy the Curioſity of Readers, unleſs the
Imagination of the Author is exerted, to feign Events that never happen'd, and
employ his Hero in Scenes he was never engaged in. This is the Caſe with Mr.
JEACOCKE. His Life has not been che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd with thoſe variegated Hues that
make ſo pleaſing an Appearance in the Biographer's Page, nor did he ever
run <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0242400300:139"/> through ſuch a Variety of Adventures, as in the
Recital excite alternately the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Paſſions of the Mind.</p>
                        <p>HE was born in <hi>London,</hi> and having receiv'd ſuch
an Education as enabled him only to read, write, and caſt Accompts, he was
put Apprentice to a Baker. He behaved extremely well in his Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip,
and was pointed out as an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for others in the ſame Station of Life. As
ſoon as his Apprenticeſhip was expir'd, by the generous Legacy of a good
old Aunt, he was enabled to ſet up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and pitch'd upon St.
<hi>Giles</hi>'s for that Purpoſe. He was remarkably diligent in his
Buſineſs, punctual in his Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and, in every Reſpect, approv'd
himſelf a truly honeſt Man; ſo that he was valued and eſteemed by every
one to whom he was known.</p>
                        <p>HAVING a perfect Knowledge of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, and being
bleſſed with ſuch a clear Judgment, as could almoſt intuitively
diſtinguiſh and ſeparate Truth from Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he was requeſted by
many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Tradeſmen, whoſe Accompts were long, embarraſſed,
and intricate, to adjuſt and ſettle them: And this he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd 
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0242400300:140"/> with an Expedition and Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that few could
equal, and none excel; even after ſome of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Accomptants in
<hi>London</hi> had deſpaired ſettling them, and pronounced them
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be made out clear and evident.</p>
                        <p>PROVIDENCE ſmiled on his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and he got Money
apace. His being appointed Preſident of the ROBIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOOD SOCIETY, made him
univerſally known, and THE BAKER has been talk'd of, I believe, in every City
and Town in <hi>England.</hi> JEACOCKE was not averſe to Popularity, nor in
Love with it for its intrinſic Worth, but for the Benefit that accompanied
it, in making him known to ſome of the greateſt Men in the Kingdom, and
ſome of the moſt reſpectable and wealthy Merchants, whoſe Accompts he
ſettled, and for which he was paid very large Sums.</p>
                        <p>IN this Situation he continued, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Wealth
and Fame, 'till the latter End of the Year 1761, when he thought proper to
reſign his Office of Preſident of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in that honourable Station nineteen Years: And in a few Months afterwards, 
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0242400300:141"/> he was appointed one of his Majeſty's Juſtices of
the Peace for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> in which Capacity he now acts
with an Integrity and Honour, with a Clearneſs of Judgment, and a Fervour of
Humanity, excell'd by none. He is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by the Rational and Judicious,
as a tacit Satire on the Practice of ſome trading Juſtices, who ſell
their <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> as a <hi>Grocer</hi> ſells his
Raiſins and Sugar, at ſo much <hi>per</hi> Pound.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH JEACOCKE has never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, what we term, a
liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet his Mind is ſtored with a greater Stock of real
Knowledge, than nineteen Parts out of twenty of thoſe who have breathed a
College Air for many Years. But though his Judgment is clear, and his Knowledge
extenſive, yet his unbounded Humanity, his amiable Chearfulneſs, his
diſcreet Complaiſance, his incorruptible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, are ſtill
ſuperior. His Philanthropy is ſo great, that Miſery and Diſtreſs
never applied to him in vain. His Advice and Purſe were ever open to the
Indigent; but his Knowledge of the World teaching him to diſtinguiſh
between real and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Diſtreſs, between honeſt Poverty and artful
Villainy, whenever he found <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0242400300:142"/> Examples of the latter, he
was as rigorous in inflicting Puniſhments, as in the former he was ready to
afford Relief. In his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment he is grave, but not auſtere; ſerious,
but not melancholy; chearful, but not merry; reſerved, but not hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical.
He poſſeſſes Judgment without Oſtentation; Humility without
Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and Worth without Pride. Ever open to Conviction, in his Office of
Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he never obtruded his Opinions on his Auditors for certain
Truths, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted them, and own'd his Miſtakes, if pointed out.
<hi>Slave</hi> to no Sect, but a Friend and Member of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> he vindicated her from the rude Aſſaults of Deiſts and
Unbelievers, not by poſitive Dogmas, and mere <hi>Ipſe Dixits,</hi> but by
candid Reaſoning, and fair Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When unacquainted with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of
Debate, he ſought not by retailing the Sentiments of others, to paſs as an
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Man, or to take up their Time by delivering a String of Words
without Meaning, but left the Queſtion to be debated by thoſe whoſe
Inclination or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation in Life put it in their Power to ſpeak to it
properly. By theſe Means, and having a retentive Memory, and a fine natural
Genius, and being remarkably <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0242400300:143"/> attentive to whatever was
ſaid on every Subject, there are few he has not now a general Knowledge of,
and a great many he is particularly converſant in. His Reaſoning is
cloſe, but not void of Perſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picuity; and his Elocution free and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
but not rapid and verboſe. He ever ſtrives rather to convince the Mind,
than to excite the Paſſions, and to deliver wholſome Truths and uſeful
Precepts, than to charm the Imagination with Paradoxes, and lead the Soul to
Fairy Ground, by the Pomp of Words, and the Richneſs of Imagery; ſo that
his Eloquence rather reſembles a ſmooth and gentle Current that glides
ſoftly along, than the foaming and majeſtic <hi>Tyber,</hi> or the rapid
<hi>Tagus,</hi> that rolls its golden Waves in Diſdain of Limits, overbearing
and ſweeping every Thing before it.</p>
                        <p>JEACOCKE being ſuch a Perſon as I have deſcribed, it
is no Wonder that he ſhould be revered by the Society. He He had a prodigious
Influence over them, and kept them in more Awe, than a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogue doth his
Scholars, or even than the Speaker of a great Aſſembly can fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently keep
the Members, as Mr. A—R <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0242400300:144"/> O—S—W

                        <head>Mr. Orator HENLEY.</head>
                        <p>SOME Account of this Phenomenon may not be unacceptable to
the Public. But as a better than I can give of him, has been already given in
one of the Notes to Mr. POPE'S <hi>Dunciad,</hi> I ſhall extract that
Paragraph, and then hazard a few Remarks of my own on this ſingular
Genius.</p>
                        <q>J. HENLEY the Orator; he preach'd on the <hi>Sundays</hi>
upon Theological Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and on the <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> upon all other
Sciences. Each Auditor paid One Shilling. He declaimed ſome Years againſt
the greateſt Perſons, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally did our Author that Honour.
WELSTED, in Oratory Tranſactions, No. I. publiſh'd by HENLEY himſelf,
gives the following Account of him: <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0242400300:145"/> He was born at
<hi>Melton Mowbray</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire.</hi> From his own Pariſh
School he went to St. <hi>John's College</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> He began
there to be uneaſy; for it <hi>ſhock'd</hi> him to find he was
<hi>commanded to believe</hi> againſt his own Judgment in Points of Religion,
Philoſophy, &amp;c. for his Genius leading him freely to <hi>diſpute all
Propoſitions,</hi> and <hi>call all Points to Account,</hi> he was impatient
under thoſe Fetters of the free-born Mind. Being admitted to Prieſt's
Orders, he found the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very ſhort and ſuperficial; and that it
was not <hi>neceſſary to conform to the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> in order
either to <hi>Deaconſhip</hi> or <hi>Prieſthood.</hi> He came to Town, and
after having for ſome Years been a Writer for Bookſellers, he had an
Ambition to be ſo for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State. The only Reaſon he did not
riſe in the Church, we are told, was the Envy of others, and a Diſreliſh
entertain'd of him, becauſe <hi>he was not qualified to be a complete
Spaniel.</hi> However, he offer'd the ſervice of his Pen to two great Men, of
Opinions and Intereſts directly oppoſite; by both of whom being rejected,
he ſet up a new Project, and ſtiled himſelf the <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0242400300:146"/>
                           <hi>Reſtorer of antient Eloquence.</hi> He thought it as lawful to take a
Licence from the King and Parliament at one Place, as another; at <hi>Hick's
Hall,</hi> as at <hi>Doctors Commons;</hi> to ſet up his Oratory in
<hi>Newport Market, Butcher Row.</hi> There (ſays his Friend) he had the
<hi>Aſſurance</hi> to form a Plan, which no Mortal ever thought of; he had
Succeſs againſt all Oppoſition; chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd his Adverſaries to fair
Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>none would diſpute</hi> with him: Writ, read, and
ſtudied twelve Hours a Day; compoſed three Diſſertations a Week on all
Subjects; undertook to teach in <hi>one Year,</hi> what Schools and
Univerſities teach in <hi>five;</hi> was not terrified by Menaces, Inſults,
or Satires, but ſtill proceeded, matured his bold Scheme, and put the
<hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>all that in Danger.</hi>

                        <q>AFTER having ſtood ſome Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he turn'd his
Rhetoric to Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry upon all public and private oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences. All this
paſs'd in the ſame Room; where ſometimes he broke Jeſts, and
ſometimes that Bread which <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0242400300:147"/> he call'd the <hi>Primitive

                        <p>THE Doctor was indeed a Compoſition of Inconſiſtency
and Singularity. He wanted not Senſe or Learning, but perverted both to the
moſt unworthy Purpoſes. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Principles of Religion very
well; but his chief Delight was in making it appear ridiculous, by the
ludicrous Light in which he view'd it himſelf, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to
others. As to any fix'd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, with Reſpect to political Notions, he
had none, but employ'd all his Talents to laugh at, and make all Government
appear a mere Joke. But though the Doctor underſtood Religion tolerably well,
and could, when he thought proper, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the different Sects, and exhibit
their various Excellencies in a ſtriking and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0242400300:148"/> Manner, yet he was more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cull out their
ſeveral Defects and Imperfections, ſo as to make all of them appear mere
human Inventions, and the Creatures which intereſted Prieſts and art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Knaves had dreſſed up, to impoſe on, and frighten the Vulgar. His chief
Talent lay in Buffoonery, and making the moſt amiable Things appear mere
Monſters, and hideous Caricatures. Thus Religion was vilified, her
Miniſters traduced, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality laugh'd at, Merit treated as a mere Non-Entity,
and the greateſt Characters in the Kingdom taken to Pieces and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſed
with all the Licentiouſneſs imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, every <hi>Sunday,</hi> when the
Ollio of Scandal and Nonſenſe was ſerv'd up to the Public. He was of an
over-bearing Temper, inſolent to his Inferiors, and unmannerly to his
Superiors. His Pride, which was exceſſive, taught him to deſpiſe every
one with whom he converſed; and his Self-Love, which was inordinate, and
reign'd over him with a deſpotic Sway, led him to ſuppoſe, that every one
was inferior to himſelf in Point of Judgment. Hence that ridiculous Vanity
which was viſible in his every Action, and prompted him to enforce his own
Arguments with the moſt indecent Noiſe and violent Geſticulations, 
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0242400300:149"/> to diſregard the Sentiments of others, and to be
continually interrupting them in the Courſe of their Reaſoning. As a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, therefore, he was odious; as a Clergyman, indecent; as an Orator
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible; as a Chriſtian, culpable; and as Man, contemptible.</p>
                        <p>THE Doctor being ſuch a Perſon as I have deſcrib'd
him, it may be wonder'd that his Oratory ſhould be ſo prodigiouſly
frequented: But, I apprehend, it is no Wonder at all. Novelties will always
attract; Scandal has Charms for many Appetites; and an unreſtrain'd
Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of railing againſt Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, will always
draw vaſt Numbers of Infidels and Libertines to hear their Patron and
Advocate ſounding the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of Sedition. Not but that others of a
different Caſt attended the Oratory: Some came to laugh <hi>with</hi> the
Orator, and ſome to laugh <hi>at</hi> him: Some, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend their Minds, and
forget the rigid Rules of Morality they had juſt before heard in our Places
of public Worſhip; and ſome to confirm themſelves in Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and
Impiety, and enable themſelves to become Diſputants.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0242400300:150"/> THE Orator, with various Succeſs,
ſtill kept up his ORATORY KING GEORGE'S, or CHARLES'S CHAPEL, as he
differently term'd it, 'till the Year 1759, when he died. At its firſt
Eſtabliſhment it was amazingly crowded, and Money flowed in upon him apace;
and between whiles, it languiſhed and drooped: But for ſome Years before
its Author's Death, it dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled away ſo much, and fell into ſuch an hectic
State, that the few Friends of it fear'd its Deceaſe was very near. The
Doctor, indeed, kept it up to the laſt, determin'd it ſhould live as long
as he did, and actually exhibited many Evenings to empty Benches. Finding no
one at length would attend, he admitted the Acquaintances of his Door-Keeper,
Runner, Mouth-Piece, and ſome others of his Followers, <hi>gratis.</hi> On
the 13th of <hi>October,</hi> however, the Doctor died, and the Oratory
ceaſed; no one having Iniquity or Impudence ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to continue it on;
ſince which it is turn'd into a Tradeſman's Warehouſe.</p>

Demeanor, which greatly prejudiced the Audience againſt him. He was a rank
Deiſt, and, on all Occaſions, ridiculed the Chriſtian Syſtem, with an
Aſperity and Acrimony that denoted his extreme Averſion to it; but, it is
ſaid, that on his Death-bed he owned the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sanctity of that
Religion, which alone can enſure an happy Immortality to thoſe who ſquare
their Lives agreeable to its holy Precepts, and, in pathetic Terms, bewailed

Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman would remove, and ſtill hamper'd by the Shackles of Religion,
which he would knock off! He was formerly a School-maſter, after that Clerk
to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; then, he had ſome Employment in a public Office, and for
theſe twelve Months laſt paſt, he has enjoy'd a Place in
<hi>Bridewell.</hi> What he intends to do now, I know not. He was for ſome
Years a main Pillar of the ROBINHOOD SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETY, and uſed to read his
Productions to the Members, inſtead of ſpeaking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore. As an Orator,
he is to the laſt Degree contemptible, having a tame and 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0242400300:165"/> lifeleſs Pronunciation, and a mean and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid
Action. His Abilities are, however, far from indifferent, but it is a Pity that
Age and Experience ſhould not have taught him Diſcretion enough—to
refrain from inſulting the Religion of his Country.</p>

                        <p>THIS Gentleman enter'd into Holy Orders about five Years
ago, ſince which he has not frequented the ROBIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOOD SOCIETY. Before that,
he uſed to be a conſtant Member, and ſpoke to every Queſtion that was
debated, with an Extent of Knowledge, and a Clearneſs of Preciſion, that
evinced, there were few Subjects he was unacquainted with. But if his Judgment
is very great, his Integrity is ſtill greater. He is a faithful Huſband, an
affectionate Father, a good Chriſtian, a firm Friend, a chearful Companion.
His Expoſition of the BIBLE, is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proof of his Piety and
Learning; his DICTIONARY, a noble Monument of critical Accuracy; and his
HISTORY of <hi>England,</hi> an undeniable Evidence of his Candor and Judgment.
As a Preacher, he is deſervedly admir'd. His Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0242400300:166"/> abſtracted from the Charms of his Delivery, will bear
the ſtricteſt Scrutiny; but when heighten'd and enforc'd by the Beauty of
Pronunciation, and Energy of Action, it is no Wonder they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort the
Admiration, and ſecure the Eſteem of the enraptured Congregation. As a
Scholar, he is greatly celebrated, being thoroughly converſant with both the
learned and modern Languages, and which all his Works in general, but his BIBLE
and DICTIONARY in particular, irrefragably prove. The laſt contains a Fund of
Knowledge beyond any other I know of; and I dare pronounce it to be the beſt
and moſt uſeful of any we have in this Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary-making Age.</p>

not be ſo common as it now is, to hear Chriſtianity ridiculed, and its

there any other MECAENAS'S to be met with, it is probable that ſo much Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
would not go unnoticed and unrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He is not very eminent as an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
an invincible Timidity ſtill hanging on him, and preventing a Diſplay of
thoſe Abilities, and that good Senſe he is Maſter of. One would naturally
imagine, that Knowledge ſhould inſpire a becoming Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; and a
Conſciouſneſs of our being thorough Maſters of a particular Subject,
ſhould make us ſpeak to it, with an intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Spirit: But we often ſee
the Reverſe, and that Ignorance bolts forth its Dictates with a free and
unconſtrained Air, while Learning and Wiſdom are ſhackled by the Fetters
which awkward Baſhfulneſs puts on them. Mr. C*L***R has not belonged to the
Society for ſome Years; but after having attended it often enough to
diſcern its Nature and Tendency, he thought he <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0242400300:174"/> could
neither be inſtructed or entertained, by going to it any more.</p>

                        <p>THIS Gentleman is a Phyſician of no ſmall Eminence. He
is a Man of great Erudition, a nervous Writer, and a fine Speaker; though, in
the Pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of many Words, he deviates from the eſtabliſhed Cuſtom
ſo much, as has ſubjected him to the Cenſures of many Critics,
particularly the ingenious Authors of the <hi>Connoiſſeur,</hi> and the
<hi>Gray's-Inn Journal;</hi> the former by BONNEL THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
and the latter by ARTHUR MURPHY, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> As a Specimen of his
Oratory, and Turn of Thinking, we ſhall give a Speech he made ſome Years
ſince, on the following Queſtion.</p>
                        <q>How are we to be certain of the Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility and
Freedom of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

                                    <p> THIS Queſtion is undoubtedly, Mr. Preſident,
of no ſmall Importance; though whether it can be properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated 
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0242400300:175"/> in a Society like this, I much doubt. I don't
inſinuate by this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that ſuch Gentlemen of Genius and
Judgment as honour us with their Company, are incapable of determining this
Queſtion, and aſcertaining the Marks whereby we may judge and
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh a free and incorrupt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a venal and corrupt one;
but am afraid, very much afraid, that thoſe Marks are not ſo eaſy to be
point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in any <hi>extempore</hi> Speech. To ſpeak to a Queſtion of
this Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, requires a previous Conſideration of the Subject, and
a deliberate Thought of what we are to utter, leſt a haſty Judgment, or
crude Conjectures, might miſlead inſtead of informing a candid Searcher
after Truth. I ſhall, however, attempt to point out ſome Criterions to
judge of a free and incorrupt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, I apprehend, may be looked on
as infallible; though I muſt neceſſarily omit others, perhaps not leſs
important, which the Brevity of Time allowed me, will not permit my
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning.</p>
                                    <p> A FREE and incorrupt Parliament the People will
ever repoſe the utmoſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0242400300:176"/> in, and though
their Deciſions may be ſometimes erroneous, they will never be unjuſt.
When this is the Caſe, it will appear evidently by the following Marks,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p> WHEN the Members of Parliament act with a
viſible Independency, and will not ſuffer any one Man to lead them by the
Noſe, or brow-beat them into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his Schemes, and thereby
deſtroy that Equality which is eſſentially requiſite to preſerve the
Liberty of theſe Aſſemblies.</p>
                                    <p> WHEN all the Acts and Reſolutions of Parliament
are manifeſtly calculated for the public Good, and not to ſerve any dark
and private Purpoſes.</p>
                                    <p> WHEN the Conduct of Gentlemen in Employment makes
it evident, that they are under no Reſtraint in the Houſe, but are left at
full Liberty to give their Votes, upon all Occaſions, according to their
Conſciences and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                                    <p> THIS is, indeed, the ſtrongeſt Mark of a free
Parliament, and we may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0242400300:177"/> conclude it to be the
Caſe, when the Members, who are in Office, do not conſtantly run in Herds,
and ſlaviſhly follow a Miniſter in all his Propoſals; but when it is
obſerved, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that they frequently divide againſt, what is
called, the Court Party, and are not turned out of their Places, at the End of
a Seſſion, without any viſible Reaſon, but giving a Vote, perhaps,
againſt ſome favourite Queſtion, or to make Room for others, whoſe only
Merit is a ſordid, pliant, and proſtitute Compliſance.</p>
                                    <p> IN ſhort, Gentlemen, a Parliament cannot be
truly denominated free, which lies under any Reſtraint or Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whatſoever; nor will their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions have any other Weight than what
Force gives them; for I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſert, that the moſt
inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Minority, or even one honeſt Man, of the meaneſt
Underſtanding, is a better Judge of political Affairs than the largeſt
Majority, which is packed together, and bribed to ſerve the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of a
bad Miniſter.</p>
                                    <p>
                                       <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0242400300:178"/> BY viewing our own
Parliament, and having an Eye to the Marks and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens I have pointed out, we
may be enabled to judge whether it is ſuch a one as mentioned in the
Queſtion. I hope, I truſt it is, and that it is quite oppoſite to one I
well remember, a few Years ago, when the grand Corrupter preſided at the
Helm. Under his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration Bribery and Corruption were reduced to a
<hi>Suſetem,</hi> Election-Jobbing was carried on as openly as any other
Trade, all Virtue and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality were laughed out of Countenance, the
intereſts of Religion were diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and its ſacred Foundations
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, and ſapped by Vice and Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Nay, the great Engine of
Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption had ſo deſpicable an Opinion of <hi>hooman</hi> Nature, that he
laid it down as an inconteſtible Truth, that no Man could, in the true
Senſe of the Word, deſerve the Appellation of Patriot, <hi>for every Man
had his Price.</hi> I ſhall cloſe theſe Remarks with a beautiful
Paſſage from our great Poet, deſcribing the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of Things at this
Juncture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking, by the Way, that every Thing was ſubſervient to the
Cauſe of <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0242400300:179"/> Venality, and contracted, like the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rays of the Sun, into one <hi>Focus,</hi> to feed this dark and infamous

                        <p>A SCOTCH Schoolmaſter, that has the Brogue on him as
ſtrong as an <hi>Highlander</hi> juſt arrived from the bleak Mountains of
the North. He lives in <hi>C—l-Street</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and
adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes to each a juſt and graceful Pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; for which he is
indiſputably well qualified—we mean, of his native <hi>Erſe,</hi> but
not of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which he cannot himſelf pronounce ſo well as
a Teague in the County of <hi>Fipperary.</hi> He is, however, a Man of good
Senſe, and poſſeſſes no ſmall Share of Learning; but as an Orator,
he may be compared with the <hi>Scotch</hi> one men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Mr. FOOTE, in his
laſt Farce; and, indeed, it is not improbable, but that in expoſing the
Abſurdity of a Schoolmaſter, with a braod <hi>Scotch</hi> Accent, teaching
an <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0242400300:181"/> elegant and graceful Pronunciation of
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> the ingenious Satiriſt had Mr. W**TE in his
Eye.—It has frequently been obſerved, with ſurpriſe, that, in
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, Schoolmaſters are extremely ſubject to Vanity and Self conceit.
But, I think, it is no great Wonder. They aſſume ſuch a ſupercilious
and haughty Air in their Schools, where, without Doubt, it is, in a great
Meaſure, neceſſary, and contract ſuch an Opiniatetry and Conceit of
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own Importance, as are not eaſily to be ſhaken off
when they leave their native Dominions. The Force of Habit is very ſrong,
and, without great Difficulty, cannot be conquered: But ſurely a
Schoolmaſter, when he leaves his School, ought to leave his
ſtiff-ſtarched Airs, and imaginary Conſequence behind him, and come into
Company with the Eaſe and Deportment of a Gentleman.—I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe
Things becauſe the Perſon, whoſe Character I am now attempting, is a
profeſſed Votary to Self-Conceit; and imagines he is intitled to the ſame
Reſpect and Homage without the Pale of his School, that he has an undoubted
Right to exact within—But this, as I have before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is the
Caſe with all of the Profeſſion.</p>

                        <p>THIS Perſon is conſider'd of ſo much Importance in
the Society, that he has frequently acted as Preſident, in which Character he
has appeared in a very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Light. To draw a Compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
J**C**KE and him, might appear invidious, and is certainly unneceſſary;
ſince every one that has ſeen each of them in the Chair but once, muſt
have perceiv'd <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0242400300:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Difference. He is by Trade a
Cabinet Maker, and lives in <hi>L—g A—e.</hi> He was born at
<hi>Falmouth</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire;</hi> and tho' he has been ſettled in
<hi>London</hi> ſome Years, he retains much of his Country Dialect. Whether
he ſcorns the ignoble Path of Imitation, or whether having no Senſe of what
is proper and improper in the Conduct of others, he is an Original without
Deſign, we are not enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Principles of Action to
determine: But his Manner of opening and conducting the Debates of the Night,
is, in all Reſpects, different from that of every other Preſident of every
Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Club that we have either heard of, read of, or ſeen.</p>
                        <p>HIS firſt Movement is a very ſingular
<hi>Manoeuvre,</hi> or rather <hi>Doit-O Euvre:</hi> It is a deliberate
Extenſion of the Fore-finger and Thumb of his Right-hand to that Part of the
Candle which is inflam'd, and which he ſuddenly compreſſes between his
ſaid Fore-finger and Thumb, giving it a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pull, call'd by the
<hi>Romans, Vellicatio:</hi> and by this <hi>Doit-O Euvre,</hi> he ſevers the
ſaid inflamed Part of the Candle exactly in the Middle, juſt as a
School-boy ſevers a Half-penny Cake, for a Moiety of which 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0242400300:186"/> he has received a Farthing from one of his
School-fellows; or, as a facetious old Gentleman divides and ſub-divides the
Fragments of a Tobacco-Pipe, while with circumſtantial Exactneſs he relates
ſome amorous Adventure of his youthful Days. After the uſeleſs
Excreſcence of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is thus nicely vellicated, the worthy Preſident
caſts it on the Floor, with a Grace ſimilar to that, which one Poet ſays
another exhibits with his Dung; and then, while Mirth ſits on every Face, and

                                    <p>THE <hi>next</hi> Queſtion on the Book for our
Evening's Debate, is <hi>a Thing</hi> of Importance; and it is this: Whether a
Lawyer or a <hi>Sollier</hi> is the <hi>moſt reputableſt</hi>
Perſon?—Pray, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, don't laugh; it is worded ſo in the
Queſtion: Whether a Lawyer, or a <hi>Sollier</hi>—Gentlemen, you may
laugh, if you pleaſe, but it is ſo here <hi>(pointing to the
Book)</hi>—Whether a Lawyer or a <hi>Sollier</hi> is the <hi>moſt
reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt</hi> Perſon? There is no Occaſion for my explaining the
Terms of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, for <hi>it is</hi> eaſy of <hi>themſelves.</hi>
The Queſtion, Gentlemen, is ſign'd <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannius.</hi>—Pray,
Gentlemen, don't laugh—It is againſt Order—<hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannicus!</hi>
Well; that's the ſame Thing. Is Mr. <hi>Britannius</hi> here? If he is not,
the Queſtion is to go from me as if <hi>'twere</hi> mine. Pray, Gentlemen, is
Mr. <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannius</hi> here, Gentlemen?—Pray, Gentlemen, <hi>to
Order!</hi> This is againſt Rule, Gentlemen, for Gentlemen to laugh, and to
ſhew their Mirth here. <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0242400300:188"/> Pray, Gentlemen, will you be
pleaſed <hi>to Order</hi>—Well, Gentlemen, as Mr. <hi>Britannius</hi>
is not here, it <hi>oft</hi> for to go from me; and the Terms of it are very
eaſy, Gentlemen: You all know, Gentlemen, What is meant by the Queſtion,
which is, to know, which is the <hi>more reputabler</hi> Profeſſion, that
of the Lawyer, or the <hi>Sollier.</hi> Now, as to a Lawyer, Gentlemen, I
think, the Term needs no Explanation, and therefore I ſha'n't treſpaſs on
your Time to tell you what it is: And as to a <hi>Sollier,</hi> it is as eaſy
to underſtand as the other; and therefore the Queſtion may be
<hi>thoft</hi> to be an Enquiry only, which is the <hi>preferabler,</hi> a
Lawyer, or a <hi>Sollier.</hi> Now, there is no Doubt but ſome Gentlemen will
think the Lawyer is the <hi>eminenter</hi> Man, and others will think the
<hi>Sollier</hi> is ſo; but that will appear by the Debates. Now, Gentlemen,
I muſt needs ſay, that for my own Part, I think a <hi>Sollier</hi> is the
moſt <hi>cruelleſt</hi> Man; becauſe as why; he carries Deſtruction and
<hi>Ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> with his Sword, when he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by the General: But
ſo you may ſay, the Lawyer does likewiſe. It's <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0242400300:189"/>
true; but then People may avoid going to Law, but not to War: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I
<hi>include,</hi> the <hi>Sollier</hi> is the moſt <hi>cruelleſt,</hi> and
his Profeſſion <hi>froft</hi> with the greateſt Miſchief in general. A
<hi>Sollier</hi> is poſſeſſed with <hi>Enthuſiam</hi>—I ſay,
<hi>Enthuſiam</hi>—Pray, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, don't laugh.—I ſay, a
<hi>Sollier</hi> is <hi>toft</hi> the Dictates of <hi>Enthuſiam,</hi> and he
is a <hi>worſer</hi> Character than a Lawyer, though ſome People may ſay,
that bad's the beſt. The moſt <hi>commoneſt</hi> Thing in the World is to
hear both theſe Characters <hi>traducified</hi>—Pray, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, don't
laugh. Gentlemen, pray, <hi>to Order</hi>—You are guilty of great
<hi>Irregulation</hi>—Gentlemen, if you don't behave better, I ſhall
deſire your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany out of the Room—Well: Does any Gentlemen here
chooſe to ſpeak to the Queſtion? Do <hi>you</hi> chooſe to ſpeak to
it, Sir? Does any Gentleman on this Side of the Way chooſe to give us his
Sentiments? What No-body ſpeak to it, Gentlemen! Why, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, it's not a
<hi>difficulter</hi> Queſtion than we uſually have for our
<hi>Diſcuſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>—Pray, Gentlemen, <hi>to Order</hi>—I
ſay, it's not a more <hi>difficulter</hi> Queſtion <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0242400300:190"/>
than many are that are propoſed for our
<hi>Diſcuſſation</hi>—Why, Gentlemen, you ſhould n't laugh; you
know what I mean; beſides, I am a <hi>Falmouth</hi> Man; from
<hi>Falmouth,</hi> Gentlemen, in <hi>Devonſhire;</hi> and you muſt not
expect my <hi>Pronunſation</hi> to be the moſt <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt,</hi> for
they all talk there as I do here—Pray, Gentlemen, don't laugh!—Does
any one chuſe to ſpeak to the Queſtion? Oh, a Gentleman is
<hi>up</hi>—Pray, Gentlemen; be ſilenced.</p>

                        <head>Mr. S**TH.</head>
                        <p>THIS Gentleman is by Trade a Dyer, and in Religion a
red-hot <hi>Antimonian.</hi> When he bellows forth his peculiar No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his
Eyes are inflamed, and his whole Body ſeems to be the Manſion of ſome
turbulent Spirit. He is no tame Orator, nor wants for Choice of Words, but is
ſo unhappy in the Application of them, that he conveys a quite different
Meaning <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0242400300:191"/> to the Minds of the Auditors from what he
himſelf underſtands: Let the Queſtion be what it will, he lugs in
Religion by the Head and Shoulders, and the moſt carnal Propoſition is
ſpiritualized into the moſt divine Meaning: Thus, the ſecret Parts of
Religion are all peeped into and expoſed, and Diſcourſes in the Style of
the <hi>Canticles,</hi> propoſed as proper for Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. S**TH is a great
Admirer of WHITFIELD, and thinks him one of the greateſt Men in
<hi>Europe.</hi> If Regard is extorted, and Eſteem rivetted, by a mutual
Sympathy of Minds, and a ſimilar Turn of Thinking, it is no Wonder our Orator
ſhould have conceived an high Opinion of his Brother Orator: And, indeed,
their Oratory is not much unlike, for Orator S**TH is as ranting, as
unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and as enthuſiaſtic, as Orator WH**F***D.</p>
                        <p>AS to the Abilities of this curious Gentleman, they may be
eaſily gueſſed at from what we have ſaid, and to dwell longer on ſuch
a Character, would be to intimate he was of more Importance than he really is.
However, we ſhould ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our Duty of giving competent 
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0242400300:192"/> Ideas of our Orators, did we not draw their leading
Features; though we pretend not to be ſo particular as to paint all of
them.</p>

only Orator in the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY that ſpeaks to a Queſtion; the
Imagination of the major Part of thoſe Gentlemen being either ſo exalted,
as to carry them into the Clouds, or ſo groveling, as to put them on a Level
with Coblers and Tinkers: The Queſtion itſelf is ſeldom adverted to; and

                        <p>AN Attorney, or an Attorney's Clerk, that pours out
Vollies of Nonſenſe, as faſt as a <hi>London</hi> Militia Platoon fire
their Muſkets. He is a profeſſed Advocate for all miniſterial
Meaſures, and endeavours to prove, by Logic and Noiſe, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
like Kings, can do no Wrong. If his Opponents inſiſt, that if they
<hi>can</hi> do no Wrong, they muſt be infallible, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility only is
the Attribute of GOD; he anſwers, they are infallible, and are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by
GOD; ſo that the divine inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſible Right of Kings, with all its
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commitant Circumſtances of Non-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Paſſive Obedience,
are ſtrongly enforced by this ingenious Quill-driver in every Political
Debate. If it is objected to him, that the <hi>Jure Divino</hi> is a Doctrine
that ſtrikes at the Vitals of our preſent Conſtitution, by tacitly
declaring the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Revolution to be an Uſurpation, and the preſent
illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> to be mere P**t**d**s to the Throne,
he will not diſpute the Inference, but maintain his Poſition.—So much
for his Political Notions. As to his religious ones, <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0242400300:195"/> he
is not leſs ſtrenuous. He thinks the Church, eſtabliſhed by Law in this
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not only the beſt viſible Church on Earth, but that it is
abſolutely without Spot or Blemiſh; and he would have as implicit a Regard
paid to all human Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Ceremonies as to the moſt divine Precepts;
and in conſequence of theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry orthodox and very charitable Opinions, he
thinks all who diſſent from the eſtabliſhed Church, <hi>ſhould
immediately quit</hi> England, <hi>and reſide elſewhere:</hi> But to what
Place they are to retire he does not inform us. As to the Deiſts, he laſhes
them without Mercy, and pronounces it impoſſible for them to be uſeful
Subjects, or honeſt Men; and therefore, as they cannot be ſerviceable in a
State, they ſhould be baniſhed from it, or broke upon the Wheel, or, at
leaſt, be kept in Priſon to hard Labour, till their Minds are open to
Conviction, and prepared to believe the glorious Truths of the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>IT is with no ſmall Difficulty we have fathomed theſe
Sentiments of our Man of Law; who brings together ſuch a Cloud of unmeaning
Words, that it requires a very penetrating Eye to ſee through the
Obſcurity: That Eye we think we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0242400300:196"/> AS an Orator, he is extremely
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible: His Action is forced, violent, and unnatural, and his
Pronunciation, which is very vicious, is made more diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable by his
ſtammering. His Mind ſeems ſtored with very few Ideas, and thoſe few,
very wrong ones. His mental Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics are extremely defective, and he views
Things by ſuch broken and refracted Rays, as render them ſcarcely
viſible. It is no Wonder, therefore, that he ſhould not be able to make his
Auditors fully perceive what he does not clearly behold himſelf. In a Word,
his Character is well expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Mr. POPE'S Parody of a Paſſage in
DENHAM'S <hi>Cooper's-Hill,</hi> deſcribing the River <hi>Thames:</hi>

Initials of Mr. C**KE'S Chriſtian Names—His Chriſtian Name is THOMAS;
but ſince a certain Operation he perform'd on himſelf, he 
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0242400300:199"/> has, in his numerous Writings, intitled himſelf A. M.
E. C**KE; Letters, which though unintelligible to the Public, are yet full of
Meaning to us, who have a great Intimacy with this Gentleman; and they
ſignify ADAM, MOSES, EMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUEL.—So much for his adopted Name.</p>
                        <p>HE was born in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a
liberal Education there, and from thence was ſent to <hi>Oxford:</hi> In due
Time he enter'd into Orders, return'd to his native County, and was ſoon
after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a pretty good Living. A Turn for Myſteries led him to
a Peruſal of ſome of our myſtic Writers, and he caught the ſame
enthuſiaſtic Flame which warm'd them. A recluſe and ſedentary Life
greatly cheriſh'd his Notions, and it was not long before Parſon C**KE was
look'd on by all the Country as a ſecond JACOB BEHMEN. But he had ſome
Notions peculiar to himſelf. He maintain'd in his Sermons, and in his private
Converſation, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies were not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated by
the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, but were ſtill of univerſal Obligation.
In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he inſiſted on the Neceſſity of Circumciſion, and
ſupported his Doctrine by his own Practice. Such novel Notions, 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0242400300:200"/> and ſuch extravagant Behaviour in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Clergyman, ſoon reached the Ears of the Biſhop of the Dioceſe, and he was
deprived, and his Living given to another. Our <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtian
then came to <hi>London,</hi> and commenced Author; but his unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
Jargon not ſelling, he was reduced to great Diſtreſs. In this Dilemma he
knew not what to do; but, at laſt, put in Practice another odd Notion, that
the Goods of Fortune ought to be ſhared in common by all God's
Creatures..</p>
                        <p>AMONG various Expedients for ſatisfying his Hunger
formed upon this Plan, one was, to reſort to ſome well-frequented
Coffee-houſe, and placing himſelf at a Table, to appropriate to his own
Uſe the firſt buttered Muffin and Pot of Coffee that was brought to it.
This he would often be permitted to do, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption from the
Gentlemen that ſat near him, ſome of whom were diverted, and ſome
aſtoniſhed, to ſee a Clergyman thus familiarly regale himſelf with a
Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt that was not provided for him. As ſoon as it was finiſhed,
however, he would riſe from the Table, ſay a ſhort Grace, and very
unconcernedly make towards the Door; and, when queſtioned by the 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0242400300:201"/> Maſter of the Coffee-houſe, about the Impropriety of
uſing that which he did not order, and the Injuſtice of not paying for it
when he had done, he would prove by Mode and Figure, that the good Things of
this World ought to be in common. The Bucks and Bloods enjoyed the Joke, and a
Ring was uſually formed for the two Diſputants, the Parſon and the
Coffee-man; but the Coffee-man being unable to invalidate the Teſtimonies
brought out of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and many learned Writings, which were
quoted in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> the Parſon always came
off vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</p>
                        <p>ANOTHER Practice by which this Gentleman ſignalized
himſelf, was Street-Preaching; and having for ſome Time before let his
Beard grow, he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known by the Name of <hi>The Bearded
Prieſt.</hi> In this extravagant Manner he went on for ſome Time, 'till
ſome Clergymen made Intereſt for him to be ſent to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> where
he was confined for about two or three Years. As ſoon as he was releaſed,
he took a Reſolution of going to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and actually travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
over that Country on Foot, with not a ſingle Farthing in his Pocket,
ſubſiſting, <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0242400300:202"/> as himſelf informs us in one of his
Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, by the Contributions of the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed. From thence he went
to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and travelled over a great Part of that Kingdom; and on
his Arrival at <hi>Dublin,</hi> in 1760, was entertained by ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
in <hi>Trinity College,</hi> who, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionating the melancholy Caſe of
a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Diſtreſs, gave him his Board and Lodging <hi>gratis.</hi>
After he had ſtaid here a few Months, and publiſhed ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>original</hi> Pieces, which no one could underſtand but himſelf, he
return'd to <hi>England,</hi> viſited <hi>Oxford,</hi> and then came again to
<hi>London,</hi> where he now reſides, but intends going to <hi>America,</hi>
as ſoon as his Finances will enable him.</p>

                        <p>A MAN that, by his Oddity of Aſpect, and Peculiarity of
Expreſſion, has attracted the public attention in a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Degree;
for he has been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured by being made the Subject of ſome
Eſſays in our daily Papers.</p>
                        <p>HE was born at <hi>Exeter</hi> about fifty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eight Years
ago, of poor, but, as it is ſaid, honeſt Parents, who ſent him to School,
where he learnt both to read and write. At the Age of thirteen he was
apprenticed there to a Shoemaker, and during his Apprenticeſhip, took great
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in reading the delectable Poems of WITHERS, QUARLES, HERBERT,
CLEVELAND, and other <hi>very great</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and read them ſo
frequently, that he got many of them by Heart. At the Expiration of his
Apprenticeſhip, he came to <hi>London,</hi> and having received ſome
ſmall Pittance from his Friends, ſet up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the
<hi>Strand,</hi> took unto him a Wife, and had four or five Children by her. So
far we ſee the bright View of his Life's Hiſtory. But the World ſoon
frowned <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0242400300:208"/> on him; and though he was continually 
<q rend="inline">"ſupplying his Knowledge-Box with
Furniture,"</q> as himſelf elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, by reading the
before-mentioned Authors, and attending conſtantly at Mr. Orator HENLEY'S
Chapel, to whom he was Mouth-Piece, running on his Errands, praiſing his
Oratory, and doing him other Services, yet his Stock in Trade, his Houſhold
Goods, his Cuſtomers, and his Reputation, were decreaſing daily. Altho'
Poverty now not only ſtared our Orator in the Face, but was his conſtant
Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet was he indefatigable in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his Mind, and bore
his Miſery with great Patience. But his <hi>Rib</hi> poſſeſſed not
the ſame Fortitude. She lamented her Infelicity in very pathetic Terms, and
Tears ran from her Eyes in copious Streams. P*** beheld her Diſtreſs with
the Apathy of a Stoic; he anſwered her Complaints and Remonſtrances with
ſome Verſes of QUARLES, and her Tears he endeavoured to dry up with ſome
Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents from HERBERT or CLEVELAND: but all would not avail; her Tongue
ſtill ran on, and her Tears ſtill flowed. She wanted more ſubſtantial
Food, than dull Lines of Jingle; and had rather ſee ſome Bread and
Cheeſe, and ſmall Beer <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0242400300:209"/> on the Table, for herſelf
and Children, than hear the beſt Arguments in the World, to prove that
<hi>whatever is, is right.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings and ſevere Reproaches followed,
and the Wife inſiſted, that the Huſband was an idle Fellow, who neglected
his Buſineſs, and the moſt important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, merely to prate about
Things he did not underſtand, and to attend the Atheiſtical Orator, whoſe
Diſcourſes he could never be benefitted by. After living ſome Years in
this uncomfortable State, the Wife and Children left the Huſband to his Fate,
and purſued their own. The Wife took decent Lodgings, ſought out for
Buſineſs in Waſhing and Plain-Work, and ſucceeded ſo well, that ſhe
bred up her Children properly, wanted for nothing, and lived happily. As to our
Son of CRISPIN, he took a paltry Lodging, and went on in the ſame idle Manner
as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, getting what Work he could, and putting it out to be performed. In
this Manner he has continued for ſome Years.</p>
                        <p>As to the Oratory of this <hi>Poetical Cobler,</hi> as he
is uſually called, it is,

his own Sentiments on the Queſtion, but only of an Application of the
Sentiments of thoſe polite Authors he is moſt converſant with. He is,
indeed, a mere Retailer of other Men's Opinions, and his Orations are like an

himſelf a Man of great Knowledge; and takes the Laugh of Contempt, which he
frequently hears at the Society, for a Proof of their Approbation.</p>

as when a Man is eloquent; and to be ſo, he ought to do as I do; that is,
drink a good deal of Gin, and avoid eating Onions. A great Poet ſays; 
<q> 
                                             <l>Immortal Gin! ſince I have ſung thy

diſpute it that has poiſed <hi>their</hi> Underſtanding, and not violated
the Dignity of human Nature. Thoſe who diſpute it, like my Wife's

                                          </q> As to that Gentleman that ſaid Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is hurtful to
Society, becauſe Poets are eloquent, and, in conſequence 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0242400300:214"/> of it, poor, it by no Means follows;
<hi>howſumdever,</hi>

                                             <l>Could Poets live, Camelion-like, on Air;</l>

                                             <l>If neither Thirſt or Hunger could

                                             <l>The pooreſt Poet never need deſpair.</l>
                                          </q> So that this Gentleman's Speech was a falſe Motion, Mr. Preſident, and
the Queſtion topped his Underſtanding; <hi>howſumdever,</hi> he choſe
to ſpeak to it, leſt he ſhould over-gorge himſelf, and burſt at the
Touch-hole. Another Gentleman, who ſaid as how Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was pernicious,
ſeems to have contracted all his Senſes into his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprit, to have
loaded his Head with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and then to have primed, cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fired
away; <hi>howſumdever,</hi> I excuſe him, becauſe I find he is one of the
croſs-legged Knights of the Steel-Bar, and a Wit. But Mr. POPE ſays, 
<q> 
                                             <l>A Wit's a Feather, and a Chief's a Rod;</l> 
                                             <l>An honeſt Man's the nobleſt Work of
<hi>GOD.</hi>
                                             </l>
                                          </q> Eloquence, Mr. Preſident, is the Gift of the SUPREME;
and we <hi>oft</hi> not to deſpiſe any of his Gifts: Now, if I had 
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0242400300:215"/> the Wiſdom of ULYSSES, the Arms of ACHILLES, the
Riches of CROESUS, and the Wiſdom of SOLOMON, 
<q> 
                                             <l>I'd ſcower the Univerſe from Folly and
from Vice,</l> 
                                             <l>And make this World a ſecond
Paradiſe.</l>
                                          </q> But I fear it's impoſſible for me to do this, though,
with Eloquence, one might almoſt do any Thing, even if one were attacked both
in Front and Flank, and knocked down in the Rear. But I think that thoſe
ſhould, 
<q> 
                                             <l>Who ſtrive to diſcompoſe th' exalted
Mind,</l> 
                                             <l>Be to eternal Baniſhment confin'd.</l>
                                          </q>
And ſome of theſe there are in this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, who are for interrupting me
in my Diſcourſe very often; but they had better open the Caſements of
their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to let in Light to their Minds, as I do; for I always 
<q> 
                                             <l>Do much deſire and long to know,</l> 
                                             <l>The Wit that from Choice Spirits
flow.</l>
                                          </q> Mr. Preſident! I ſee your all-ſilencing Hammer is lifted up
to knock me <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0242400300:216"/> down; but I ſhall juſt deſire to
relate a Fact, which I know to be true, of the public Crier at
<hi>Topſham</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> which I conſider as a very good
Piece of Eloquence. He had no leſs than ten Children; and they becoming
charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Pariſh, he was required by the Church-wardens to get no
more, and uſed barbarouſly for thoſe he had; whereupon he went into the
Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, took his Bell in his Hand, rung it, and then ſaid, <hi>O
Yes!—O Yes!—O Yes!—This is to give Notice,</hi> 
                                          <q> 
                                             <l>That when Breeches and Petticoats do come
near,</l> 
                                             <l>Fleſh and Blood cannot forbear.</l>
                                          </q>
This was wielding the ſacred Weapon, and making the Muſe to flow, and I
think he acted right in all Reſpects; for Mr. POPE ſays, 
<q> 
                                             <l>The Goods of Fortune variouſly are
giv'n;</l> 
                                             <l>A Wife is the peculiar Gift of
Heav'n.</l>
                                          </q> He doesn't ſay two, Mr. Preſident. But I ſee the
uplifted, all-ſilencing Hammer again fills your Hand, and threatens my Head;
and therefore I <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0242400300:217"/> muſt conclude. But, Mr. Preſident,
give me Leave to mention a bad Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in this Society, which is to ſhew
Marks of their <hi>Approbration</hi> or <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbration:</hi> Now, Mr.
Preſident, I never clap the Speakers, for fear of p*x**g their
Underſtandings; and yet, I'll work, walk, or talk, as much for a Shilling, as
any Lawyer or Parſon in <hi>England</hi> will for a Guinea.</p>

            <p>WITH this Character we ſhall cloſe our Account of the
principal Speakers of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY; an Account, that though written
without Embelliſhment, is not deſtitute of Fidelity and Candour.
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>influenced by any private Views, we have neither indulged Reſentment by
wanton Cenſure, nor, for the Sake of perſonal At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, proſtituted
Praiſe.</p>
            <p>OF the general Character of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and its Influence on the
Minds of young Perſons, little has been ſaid: And while we were lately
ruminating on the Manner in which we ſhould conclude this great Work, a
Friend, who had peruſed our Manuſcript, came in; and, after knowing the
Subject of our Meditations, thus warmly expoſtulated upon it.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0242400300:218"/> 
               <p> THERE can be no Doubt in what Light the Society muſt appear
to every Mind, whoſe Judgment is not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Fancy and Paſſion,
but by the Nature and Tendency of Principles and Actions demonſtrated by
Facts. From the Hiſtory you have given of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is evident, that
it maintained its Uſefulneſs and Honour no longer, than while it faithfully
adhered to that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law of its Inſtitution, by which all religious
Queſtions were excluded from the Subjects of Debate.</p> 
               <p>WHEN, for the Diffuſion of uſeful Knowledge, it was thought
expedient to admit every Perſon that choſe to come, and, for that
Purpoſe, to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at a Public-Houſe; if two or three Hours had been
ſet apart for the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Night, and no eating drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or
ſmoaking had been permitted in that Interval; and, if the Subjects of Debate
had been confined to the Trade and Manufactures of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to
Natural Hiſtory, the Mathematics, and the Liberal Arts; how poorly would the
Meetings of the Society have been attended! Though its Credit might 
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0242400300:219"/> have remained, its Number would not have been much
increaſed. But, as ſoon as it was known, that the Drunkard and the Glutton
might regale them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the Expence of the Temperate, and that every
illiterate Prater might diſplay his Oratory, and ſignalize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as
the Champion of Deiſm or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; the Society was immediately crowded
with noiſy Butchers, Tinkers, and Coblers; with ſelf-conceited and
frontleſs Infidels; with thoſe not leſs profane, though more
inconſiſtent, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Socinians;</hi> and with the moſt
contentious, and yet the worſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters about Chriſtianity,
<hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Antinomians.</hi> The firſt Principles of
Religion, and the eſſential Doctrines of the Goſpel, were called in
Queſtion every Night in the Preſence of young People, who unhappily
deviating in their Search after Truth and Goodneſs, were here betrayed into
Error, and ſhut up from the Sight of That, by which alone Sin can be
deſtroyed and Holineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p> 
               <p>THE <hi>Book of Queſtions,</hi> as you have repreſented it,
is itſelf a ſufficient Proof of the licentious and even wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0242400300:220"/> Levity, with which the moſt ſacred Doctrines and
Characters have been treated: In the Specimen of Religious Queſtions which,
you ſay, you have ſelected from that Book, there were two, which I was
compelled to ſtrike out, to ſave myſelf from being a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker in the
Guilt of the moſt horrid Blaſphemy. And he, who, by his Preſence, has
contributed to ſupport a Society, in which ſuch Queſtions are ſuffered
to be propoſed, regiſtered, and debated, has ſo far contributed to the
Support of Profaneneſs and Impiety. From this Charge I exempt not even THE
BAKER himſelf, who is intitled to no higher Honour from his long
Preſidentſhip, than that of keeping a rude Multitude in ſome external
Order, and preſerving the Regularity of an Infidel-Diſputation.</p> 
               <p>MANY Things, indeed, are called Religion that do not belong to
it; but that which is eſſential in Religion, is private and perſonal,
ſubſiſting not in diſputable Notions and refined Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, but in the
Senſibilities and Perceptions of the Heart: For who, in his Senſes, can
diſpute a Moment <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0242400300:221"/> whether he is a Sinner? and who, that
feels himſelf a Sinner, can diſpute a Moment whether he ſhould receive or
reject the Pardon that is offered him? and who can depend upon the Pardon of
Sin, any further than he feels in his Heart a Principle diſapproving,
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning, reſiſting and ſubduing the Power of Sin? And yet what is
more prevalent in all our <hi>Societies for Free Debate and Inquiry,</hi> than
the Folly and Madneſs of attempting to deſtroy theſe Senſibilities, to
ſtifle theſe Convictions, and to prove, by Logical Diſputation, that Man
is now as he was originally made; that he is, therefore, no Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and that,
conſequently, he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no Redeemer. But he, who abandons that penitential
and humbling Senſe of Sin, and that endearing Senſe of pardoning Mercy,
which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Redemption awakens in every Heart; and endeavours to
perſuade himſelf, that he can be ſet free from his Evil and Miſery, and
made good and happy, by Definitions, or Axioms, or Forms, or Syſtems, or any
Thing leſs than the Renovation of a Divine Life; abandons that for which the 
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0242400300:222"/> whole Creation cannot yield him a Recompence.</p> 
               <p>OF the Nature and Tendency of all theſe <hi>Societies for free
Debate and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> the Writer of THE ADVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURER has expreſſed his
Sentiments with juſt Indignation.</p> 
               <p>NOTHING <hi>(ſays he)</hi> has offended me more, than the
Manner in which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of eternal Moment are often treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To diſpute on
Moral and Theological Topics, is become a Faſhion; and it is uſual with
Perſons, of whom it is no Reproach to ſay they are ignorant, becauſe
their Opportunities of gaining Knowledge have been few, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with the
utmoſt confidence upon Queſtions to which no human Intellect is equal. In
almoſt every Tavern and every Alehouſe, illiterate Petulance prates of
Fitneſs and Virtue, of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Fate; and it is common to hear Diſputes
concerning everlaſting Happineſs and Miſery, the Myſteries of Religion
and the Attributes of GOD, intermingled with Lewdneſs and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, or at
leaſt treated with wanton Negligence and abſurd Merriment.</p> 
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0242400300:223"/> FOR Lewdneſs and Blaſphemy, it is
hoped no Apology will ſeriouſly be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: And it is probable, that if
the Queſtion in Debate was, which of the Diſputants ſhould be hanged on
the Morrow, it would be conducted with Decency and Gravity, as a Matter of
ſome Importance: That viſible good Humour, and that noble Freedom, of which
they appear to be ſo fond, would be thought not well to agree with their
Subject; nor would either of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen be much delighted, if an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
intended to demonſtrate that he would, within a few Hours, be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on a Gibbet, ſhould be embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with a witty Alluſion to a Button and
Loop, or a jocular Remark, that it would effectually ſecure him from future
Accidents, either by Land or Water: And yet the Juſtice and Mercy of
OMNIPOTENCE, the Life and Death of the Soul, are treated with Ridicule and
Sport; and it is contended, that with Ridicule and Sport, they ought always to
be treated.</p> 
               <p>BUT the Effect, as well as the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thoſe faſhionable
Diſputes, is <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0242400300:224"/> always ill: They tend to eſtabliſh
what is called Natural Religion, upon the Ruins of CHRISTIANITY; and a Man has
no ſooner ſtiled himſelf a Moral Philoſopher, than he finds that his
Duty both to GOD and Man, is contracted into a very ſmall Compaſs, and may
be practiſed with the greateſt Facility. Yet, as this Effect is not always
appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, the Unwary are frequently delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into fatal Error, and imagine
they are attaining the higheſt Degree of Moral Excellence, while they are
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly loſing the Principles upon which alone Temptation can be
reſiſted, and a ſteady Perſeverance in well-doing, ſecured.</p> 
               <p>AMONG other favourite and unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Topics, is the
EXCELLENCY OF VIRTUE. Virtue is ſaid neceſſarily to produce its own
Happineſs, and to be conſtantly and adequately its own Reward; as Vice, on
the contrary, never fails to produce Miſery, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon itſelf the
Puniſhment it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves; Propoſitions, of which every one is ready to
affirm, that they may be admitted without Scruple, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved without
Danger. But from hence <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0242400300:225"/> it is inferred, that future
Rewards and Puniſhments are not neceſſary, either to furniſh adequate
Motives to the Practice of Virtue, or to juſtify the Ways of GOD: In
Conſequence of their being not neceſſary, they become doubtful; the DEITY
is leſs and leſs the Object of Fear and Hope; and as Virtue is ſaid to be
that which produces ultimate Good below, whatever is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to produce
ultimate Good below, is ſaid to be Virtue: Right and wrong are confounded,
becauſe remote Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences cannot perfectly be known; the principal
Barrier by which Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and Paſſion are reſtrained, is broken down.
The Remonſtrances of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are overborne by Sophiſtry; and the
acquired and habitual Shame of Vice is ſubdued by the perpetual Efforts of
vigorous Reſiſtance.</p> 
               <p>THE Paper which contains this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſeems to have been

alleviate the Miſeries of Life, none is left to deſpair but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint: And

ſupply new Reſources to Diſappointment. But not being able to deny
himſelf the Pleaſure he found in having me about him, inſtead of
ſending me out to a Boarding-School, he offered the Curate of the Pariſh
ten Pounds a Year and his Board, to become my Tutor.</p>
                        <p>THIS Gentleman, who was in Years, and had lately buried
his Wife, accepted the Employment, but refuſed the Salary: The Work of
Education, he ſaid, would agreeably fill his Intervals of Leiſure, and 
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0242400300:228"/> happily coincide with the Duties of his Function: But he
obſerved that his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, which was thirty Pounds a Year, and had long
ſubſiſted him when he had a Family, would make him wealthy now he was a
ſingle Man; and therefore he inſiſted to pay for his Board: To this my
Father, with whatever Reluctance, was obliged to conſent. At the Age of ſix
Years I began to read my Accidence under my Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and at fifteen had gone
through the Latin and Greek Claſſics. But the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages were not all that
I learned of this Gentleman; beſides other Science of leſs Importance, he
taught me the Theory of CHRISTIANITY by his Precepts, and the Practice by his
Example.</p>
                        <p>AS his Temper was calm and ſteady, the Influence which
he had acquired over me, was unlimited: He was never capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eiouſly ſevere;
ſo that I regarded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure not as an Effect of his Infirmity,
but of my own Fault: He diſcovered ſo much Affection in the Pleaſure with
which he commended, and in the tender concern with which he reproved me, that I
loved him as a Father; and his Devotion, tho' rational and manly, was yet ſo
habitual and fervent, that I reverenced him as a <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0242400300:229"/> Saint.
I found even my Paſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled by an Awe which his Preſence
impreſſed; and, by a conſtant Attention to his Doctrine and Life, I
acquired ſuch a Senſe of my Connexion with the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World, and
ſuch a Conviction of the Conſciouſneſs of DEITY to all my Thoughts,
that every inordinate Wiſh was ſecretly ſuppreſſed, and my Conduct
regulated by the moſt ſcrupulous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection.</p>
                        <p>MY Father thought he had now taken ſufficient Care of my
Education, and therefore began to expect that I ſhould aſſiſt in
overlooking his Servants, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging his Farm, in which he intended I
ſhould ſucceed him: But my Preceptor, whoſe principal View was not my
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Advantage, told him, that, as a Farmer, great Part of my Learning
would be totally uſeleſs; and that the only Way to make me ſerviceable to
Mankind, in Proportion to the Knowledge I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, would be to ſend me
to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, that at a proper Time I might take Orders. But my Father,
beſides that he was ſtill unwilling to part with me, had probably many
Reaſons againſt my entering the World in a Caſſock: Such, 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0242400300:230"/> however, was the Deference which he paid to my Tutor,
that he had almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly ſubmitted to his Determination; when a
Relation of my Mother's, who was an Attorney of great Practice in the
<hi>Temple,</hi> came to ſpend part of the long Vacation at our Houſe, in
conſequence of Invitations which had been often repeated during an Abſence
of many Years.</p>
                        <p>MY Father thought that an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſulting how
to diſpoſe of me with a man ſo well acquainted with Life, was not to be
loſt; and perhaps he ſecretly hoped, that my Preceptor would give up his
Opinion as indefenſible, if a Perſon of the Lawyer's Experience ſhould
declare againſt it. My Couſin was accordingly made Umpire in the Debate;
and after he had heard the Arguments on both Sides, he declared againſt my
becoming a Farmer: He ſaid it would be an Act of Injuſtice to bury my Parts
and Learning in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of Rural Life; becauſe, if produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the
World, they would probably be rewarded with Wealth and Diſtinction. My
Preceptor imagined the Queſtion was now finally determined in his Favour; and
being obliged to viſit one of his Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners that was ſick, he gave me
a Look <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0242400300:231"/> of Congratulation as he went out, and I perceived
his Cheek glow with a Fluſh of Triumph, and his Eye ſparkle with Tears of
Delight.</p>
                        <p>BUT he had no ſooner left the Room, than my Couſin
gave the Converſation another Turn: He told my Father, that though he had
oppoſed his making me a Farmer, he was not an Advocate for my becoming a
Parſon; for that, to make a young Fellow a Parſon, without being able to
procure him a Living, was to make him a Beggar. He then made ſome witty
Reflections on the old Gentleman who was juſt gone out: 
<q rend="inline">"Nobody <hi>(he ſaid)</hi> could
queſtion his having been put to a bad Trade, who conſidered his
Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances now he had followed it forty Years."</q> And after ſome
other ſprightly Sallies, which, though they made my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laugh, made me
tremble, he clapped him upon the Shoulder, 
<q rend="inline">"If you have a Mind your Boy ſhould make
a Figure in Life, old Gentleman, <hi>(ſays he)</hi> put him Clerk to me: My
Lord Chancellor <hi>King</hi> was no better than the Son of a Country Shop
keeper; and my Maſter gave a Perſon of much greater Eminence many a
Half-crown, when he was an <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0242400300:232"/> Attorney's Clerk in the next
Chambers to mine. What ſay you? Shall I take him up with me or no?"</q> My
Father, who had liſtened to this Propoſal with great Eagerneſs, as ſoon
as my Couſin had done ſpeaking, cried, 
<q rend="inline">"A Match;"</q> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gave him
his Hand in Token of his Conſent. Thus the Bargain was ſtruck, and my Fate
determined before my Tutor came back.</p>
                        <p>IT was in vain that he afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the
Character of my new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and expreſſed the moſt dreadful
Apprehenſions at my becoming an Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's Clerk, and entering into the
Society of Wretches who had been repreſented to him, and perhaps not
unjuſtly, as the moſt Profligate upon Earth: They do not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, become
worſe than others, merely as Clerks; but as Perſons who, with more Money to
ſpend in the Gratification of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, are ſooner than others abandoned
to their own Conduct: For, though they are taken from under the Protection of a
Parent, yet, being ſcarce conſidered as in a State of Servitude, they are
not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reſtrained by the Authority of a Maſter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0242400300:233"/> MY Father had conceived of my
Couſin as the beſt natured Man in the World, and, probably, was intoxicated
with the Romantic Hope of living to ſee me upon the Bench in
<hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> or of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me upon the Circuit, lolling in
my own Coach, and attended by a Crowd of the inferior Inſtruments of
Juſtice. He was not therefore to be moved, either by Expoſtulation or
Intreaty; and I ſet out with my Couſin on Horſeback, to meet the Stage at
a Town within a few Miles, after having taken Leave of my Father, with a
Tenderneſs that melted us both; and received from the hoary Saint his laſt
Inſtructions and Benediction, and at length the parting Embrace, which was
given with the ſilent Ardour of unutterable Wiſhes, and repeated with Tears
that could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be ſuppreſſed or concealed.</p>
                        <p>WHEN we were ſeated in the Coach, my Couſin began to
make himſelf merry with the Regret and Diſcontent that he perceived in my
Countenance, at leaving a Cow-houſe, a Hog-ſtye, and two old Grey-pates,
who were contending whether I ſhould be buried in a Farm or a College. I, who
had never heard either my Father <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0242400300:234"/> or my Tutor treated
with Irreverence, could not conceal my Diſpleaſure and my Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But he ſtill continued to rally my Country Simplicity with many Alluſions,
which I did not then underſtand, but which greatly delighted the reſt of
the Company. The fourth Day brought us to our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's End; and my Maſter,
as ſoon as we reached his Chambers, ſhook me by the Hand, and bid me
welcome to the <hi>Temple.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HE had been ſome Years a Widower, and his only Child, a
Daughter, being ſtill at a Boarding-ſchool, his Family conſiſted only
of a Man and Maid Servant, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for, though he had two hired Clerks,
yet they lodged and boarded themſelves. The horrid Lewdneſs and
Profaneneſs of theſe Fellows terrified and diſguſted me; nor could I
believe that my Maſter's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Intereſt could be ſafely
intruſted with Men who, in every Reſpect, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſo deſtitute
of Virtue and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: I therefore thought it my Duty to appriſe him of his
Danger; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly one Day, when we were at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I communicated my
Suſpicion, and the Reaſon upon which it was founded. The formal Solemnity
with which I intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this Converſation, and the Air of 
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0242400300:235"/> importance which I gave to my Diſcovery, threw him
into a violent Fit of Laughter, which ſtruck me dumb with Confuſion and
Aſtoniſhment. As ſoon as he recovered himſelf, he told me, that though
his Clerks might uſe ſome Expreſſions that I had not been accuſtomed
to hear, yet he believed them to be very honeſt; and that he placed more
Confidence in them, than he would in a formal Prig, of whom he knew nothing but
that he went every Morning and Evening to Prayers, and ſaid Grace before and
after Meat; that, as to ſwearing, they meant no Harm; and, as he did not
doubt but that every young Fellow liked a Girl, it was better they ſhould
joke about it than be hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and ſly: not that he would be thought to
ſuſpect my Integrity, or to blame me for Practices which he knew to be
merely Effects of the Bigotry and Superſtition, in which I had been educated,
and not the Diſguiſes of Cunning, or the Subterfuges of Guilt.</p>
                        <p>I WAS greatly mortified at my Couſin's Behaviour on this
Occaſion, and wondered from what Cauſe it could proceed, and why he
ſhould ſo lightly paſs over thoſe <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0242400300:236"/> Vices in
others, from which he abſtained himſelf; for I had never heard him ſwear;
and as his Expreſſions were not obſcene, I imagined his Converſation
was chaſte; in which, however, my Ignorance deceived me, and it was not long
before I had Reaſon to change my Opinion of his Character.</p>
                        <p>THERE came one Morning to enquire for him at his Chambers,
a Lady, who had ſomething in her Manner which caught my Attention, and
excited my Curioſity: Her Cloaths were fine, but the Manner in which they
were put on, was rather flaunting than elegant; her Addreſs was not eaſy
nor polite, but ſeemed to be a ſtrange Mixture of affected State and
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Familiarity: She looked in the Glaſs while ſhe was ſpeaking
to me, and without any Confuſion adjuſted her Tucker; ſhe ſeemed rather
pleaſed than diſconcerted, at being regarded with Earneſtneſs; and
being told, that my Couſin was abroad, ſhe aſked ſome trifling
Queſtions, and then making a light Curtſey, took up the Side of her Hoop
with a Jerk, that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at leaſt half her Leg, and hurried down
Stairs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0242400300:237"/> I COULD not help enquiring of the
Clerks, if they knew this Lady; and was greatly confounded when they told me,
with an Air of Secrecy, that ſhe was my Couſin's Miſtreſs, whom he had
kept al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two Years in Lodgings near <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi> At firſt I
ſuſpected this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but it was ſoon confirmed by ſo many
Circumſtances, that I could no longer doubt of its Truth.</p>
                        <p>AS my Principles were yet untainted, and the Influence of
my Education was ſtill ſtrong, I regarded my Couſin's Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as
impious and deteſtable; and his Example rather ſtruck me with Horror, than
ſeduced me to Imitation. I flattered myſelf with Hopes of effecting his
Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and took every Opportunity to hint the Wickedneſs of allowed
Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; for which I was always rallied when he was diſpoſed to be
merry, and anſwered with the contemptuous Sneer of Self-ſufficiency, when
he was ſullen.</p>
                        <p>NEAR four Years of my Clerkſhip were now expired, and I
had never yet entered the Liſts as a Diſputant with my Couſin: For tho' I
conceived myſelf to be much <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0242400300:238"/> his Superior in Moral and
Theological Learning; and though he often admitted me to familiar
Converſation, yet I ſtill regarded the Subordination of a Servant to a
Maſter, as one of the Duties of my Station, and preſerved it with ſuch
exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I never exceeded a Queſtion or a Hint, when we were alone,
and was always ſilent when he had Company; tho' I frequently heard ſuch
Proſitions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, as made me wonder that no tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Token of the
Divine Diſpleaſure immediately followed: But coming one Night from the
Tavern, warm with Wine, and, as I imagined, fluſhed with Polemic Succeſs,
he inſiſted upon my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one Glaſs with him before he went to Bed; and
almoſt as ſoon as we were ſeated, he gave me a formal Challenge, by
denying all DIVINE REVELATION, and defying me to prove it.</p>
                        <p>I NOW conſidered every Diſtinction as thrown down, and
ſtood forth as the Champion of Religion, with that Elation of Mind which the
Hero always feels at the Approach of Danger. I thought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecure of
Victory; and rejoicing that he had now compelled me to do what I had often
wiſhed he would permit, I obliged <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0242400300:239"/> him to declare that
he would diſpute upon equal Terms, and we began the Debate. But it was not
long before I was aſtoniſhed to find myſelf confounded by a Man, whom I
ſaw half drunk, and whoſe Learning and Abilities I deſpiſed when he was
ſober; for as I had but very lately diſcovered, that any of the Principles
of Religion, from the Immortality of the Soul to the deepeſt Myſtery, had
been ſo much as queſtioned, all his Objections were new. I was
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted where I had made no Preparation for Defence; and having not been
ſo much accuſtomed to Diſputation, as to conſider, that in the
preſent Weakneſs of Human Intellects, it is much eaſier to object than to
anſwer, and that in every Diſquiſition, Difficulties are found which
cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, I was overborne by the ſudden Onſet, and in the
Tumult of my Search after Anſwers to his Cavils, forgot to preſs the
poſitive Arguments on which Religion is eſtabliſhed: He took Advantage of
my Confuſion, proclaimed his own Triumph, and, becauſe I was depreſſed,
treated me as vanquiſhed.</p>
                        <p>As the Event which had thus mortified my Pride, was
perpetually revolved in my Mind, the ſame Miſtake ſtill continued: 
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0242400300:240"/> I enquired for Solutions inſtead of Proofs, and found
myſelf more and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the Snares of Sophiſtry. In ſome other
Converſations which my Couſin was now eager to begin, new Difficulties were
ſtarted, the Labyrinth of Doubt grew more intricate, and as the Queſtion
was of infinite Moment, my Mind was brought into the moſt diſtreſsful
Anxiety. I ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated inceſſantly on the Subjects of our Debate,
ſometimes chiding myſelf for my Doubts, and ſometimes applauding the
Courage and Freedom of my Enquiry.</p>
                        <p>WHILE my Mind was in this State, I heard by Accident that
there was a Club at an Alehouſe in the Neighbourhood, where ſuch Subjects
were freely debated, to which every Body was admitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scruple or
Formality: To this Club in an evil Hour I reſolved to go, that I might learn
how knotty Points were to be diſcuſſed, and Truth diſtinguiſhed from
Error.</p>
                        <p>ACCORDINGLY, on the next Club-Night, I mingled with the
Multitude that was aſſembled in this School of Folly and Infidelity: I was
at firſt diſguſted at the groſs Ignorance of ſome, and ſhocked at 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0242400300:241"/> the horrid Blaſphemy of others; but Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
prevailed, and my Senſibility by Degrees wore off. I found that almoſt
every Speaker had a different Opinion, which ſome of them ſupported by
Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that to me, who was utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with Diſputation,
appeared to hold oppoſite Probabilities in exact Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe; ſo that,
inſtead of being confirmed in any Principle, I was diveſted of all; the
Perplexity of my Mind was increaſed, and I contracted ſuch a Habit of
queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatever offered to my Imagination, that I almoſt doubted of
my own Exiſtence.</p>
                        <p>IN Proportion as I was leſs aſſured in my
Principles, I was leſs circumſpect in my Conduct: But ſuch was ſtill
the Force of Education, that any groſs Violence offered to that which I had
held ſacred, and every Act which I had been uſed to regard as incurring the
Forfeiture of the DIVINE FAVOUR, ſtung me with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe. I was, indeed,
ſtill reſtrained from flagitious Immorality, by the Power of Habit: But
this Power grew weaker and weaker, and the natural Propenſity to Ill
gradually took Place, as the Motion that is communicated to a Ball which is
ſtruck up into the Air, becomes every <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0242400300:242"/> Moment leſs
and leſs, 'till at Length it recoils by its own Weight.</p>
                        <p>FEAR and Hope, the great Springs of Human Action, had now
loſt their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Objects, as I doubted whether the Enjoyment of the
preſent Moment was not all that I could ſecure; my Power to reſiſt
Temptation diminiſhed with my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the GRACE OF GOD, and Regard
to the Sanction of his Law; and I was firſt ſeduced by a Proſtitute, in
my Return from a Declamation on the BEAUTY of Virtue, and the Strength of the
MORAL SENSE.</p>
                        <p>I BEGAN now to give myſelf up intirely to Senſuality,
and the Gratification of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite terminated my Proſpects of Felicity. That
Peace of Mind, which is the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of the Soul, was exchanged for the
Gloom of Doubt, and the Storm of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and my Confidence in GOD, and
Hope of everlaſting Joy, for ſudden Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and vain Wiſhes, the
Loathings of Satiety, and the Anguiſh of Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>I WAS, indeed, impatient under this Fluctuation of
Opinion, and therefore I <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0242400300:243"/> applied to a Gentleman, who was
a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Speaker at the Club, and deemed a profound Philoſopher, to
aſſiſt the Labours of my own Mind in the Inveſtigation of Truth, and
relieve me from Diſtraction by removing my Doubts: But this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
inſtead of adminiſtring Relief, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Prejudice of Education, which
he ſaid hindered me from yielding without Reſerve to the Force of Truth,
and might perhaps always keep my mind anxious, though my Judgment ſhould be
convinced. But as the moſt effectual Remedy for this deplorable Evil, he
recommended to me the Works of CHUBB, MORGAN, and many others, which I procured
and read with great Eagerneſs; and though I was not at laſt a ſound
Deiſt, yet I perceived with ſome Pleaſure, that my Stock of Polemic
Knowledge was greatly increaſed; ſo that, inſtead of being an Auditor, I
commenced a Speaker at the Club: And though to ſtand up and babble to a Crowd
at an Alehouſe, 'till Silence is commanded by the Stroke of a Hammer, is as
low an Ambition as can taint the human Mind; yet I was much elevated by my new
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and pleaſed with the Deference that was paid to my Judgment.
I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, indeed, reflected, that I was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0242400300:244"/> Opinions, by which I had myſelf become vicious and
wretched: But it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately occurred, that though my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was changed, it
could not be proved that my Virtue was leſs, becauſe many Things which I
avoided as vicious upon my old Principles, were innocent upon my new. I
therefore went on in my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, and was perpetually racking my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention for
new Topics and Illuſtrations; and among other Expedients, as well to advance
my reputation, as to quiet my Conſcience, and deliver me from the Torment of
Remorſe, I thought of the following.</p>
                        <p>HAVING learned that all Error is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, becauſe it
is involuntary, I concluded that nothing more was neceſſary to quiet the
Mind, than to prove that all Vice was Error: I therefore formed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Argument: 
<q rend="inline">"No Man becomes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but from a
Belief that Vice will confer Happineſs: He may, indeed, have been told the
contrary; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith is not required of reaſonable Beings:
Therefore, as every Man ought to ſeek Happineſs, every Man may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
make the Experiment: If he is diſappointed, it is plain that he did not 
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0242400300:245"/> intend that which has happened; ſo that every Vice is
an Error, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Vice will be puniſhed."</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I COMMUNICATED this ingenious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance to my Friend
the Philoſopher, who, inſtead of detecting the Difference between Ignorance
and Perverſeneſs, or ſtating the Limitations within which we are bound to
ſeek our own Happineſs, applauded the Acuteneſs of my Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and
the Force of my Reaſoning. I was impatient to diſplay ſo novel and
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Diſcovery to the Club, and the Attention that it drew upon me,
gratified my Ambition to the utmoſt of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. I had, indeed, ſome
Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents; but they were ſo little ſkilled in Argumentation, and ſo
ignorant of the Subject, that it only rendered my Conqueſt more ſignal and
important; for the Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſummed up the Arguments on both Sides, with ſo
exact and ſcrupulous an Impartiality, that as I appeared not to have been
confuted, thoſe who could not diſcover the Weakneſs of my Antagoniſts,
thought that to confute me was impoſſible; my Sophiſtry was taken for
Demonſtration, and the Number of Proſelytes was incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The
Aſſembly conſiſted chiefly of <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0242400300:246"/> Clerks and
Apprentices, young Perſons who had received a religious, though not a liberal
Education; for thoſe who were totally ignorant, or wholly abandoned, troubled
not themſelves with ſuch Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as were carried on at our Club:
And theſe unhappy Boys, the Impetuoſity of whoſe Paſſions was
reſtrained chiefly by Fear, as Virtue had not yet become a Habit, were glad
to have the Shackles ſtruck off, which they were told Prieſtcraft had put
on.</p>
                        <p>BUT however I might ſatisfy others, I was not yet
ſatisfied myſelf; my Torment returned, and new Opiates became
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: They were not, indeed, eaſily to be found; but ſuch was my
good Fortune, that an illiterate Mechanic afforded me a moſt ſeaſonable
Relief, 
<q rend="inline">"by diſcuſſing the important
Queſtion, and demonſtrating that the Soul was not, nor could be
immortal."</q> I was, indeed, diſpoſed to believe without the ſevereſt
Scrutiny, what I now began ſecretly to wiſh; for ſuch was the State of my
Mind, that I was willing to give up the Hope of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs, to
be delivered from the Dread of perpetual Miſery; and as I thought of dying as
a remote Event, the <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0242400300:247"/> Apprehenſion of loſing my
Exiſtence with my Life, did not much interrupt the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Bagnio
and the Tavern.</p>
                        <p>THEY were, however, interrupted by another Cauſe; for I
contracted a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which alarmed and terrified me, in Proportion as its
Progreſs was ſwift, and its Conſequences were dreadful. In this
Diſtreſs, I applied to a young Surgeon, who was a Speaker at the Club, and
gained a genteel Subſiſtence by keeping it in Repair: He treated my
Complaint as a Trifle; and to prevent any ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections in this
Interval of Pain and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he rallied the deplorable Length of my
Countenance, and exhorted me to behave like a Man.</p>
                        <p>MY Pride, rather than my Fear, made me very ſolicitous
to conceal this Diſorder from my Couſin; but he ſoon diſcovered it
rather with Pleaſure than Anger, as it compleated his Triumph, and afforded
him a new Subject of Raillery and Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By the Spiritual and Corporeal
Aſſiſtance of my Surgeon, I was at Length reſtored to my Health, with
the ſame diſſolute Morals, and a Reſolution to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0242400300:248"/> my pleaſures with more Caution: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, therefore,
of hiring a Proſtitute, I now endeavoured to ſeduce the Virgin, and corrupt
the Wife.</p>
                        <p>IN theſe Attempts my new Principles afforded me great
Aſſiſtance: For I found that thoſe whom I could convert, I could
eaſily debauch; and that to convert many, nothing more was neceſſary than
to advance my Principles, and allege ſomething in Defence of them, by which I
appeared to be convinced myſelf; for not being able to diſpute, they
thought that the Argument which had convinced me, would, if they could
underſtand it, convince them: So that, by yielding an implicit Aſſent,
they at once paid a Compliment to their own Judgment, and ſmoothed the Way to
the Indulgence of Appetite.</p>
                        <p>WHILE I was thus gratifying every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Deſire,
and paſſing from one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Guilt to another, my Couſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to take his Daughter, who was now in her nineteenth Year, from School; and as
he intended to make her Miſtreſs of his Family, he quitted his Chambers,
and took a Houſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0242400300:249"/> THIS young Lady I had frequently
ſeen, and always admired; ſhe was therefore no ſooner come home, than I
endeavoured to recommend myſelf by a thouſand Aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and
rejoiced in the many Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were afforded me to entertain her
alone, and perceived that ſhe was not diſpleaſed with my Company, nor
inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my Complaiſance.</p>
                        <p>MY Couſin, though he had ſeen the Effects of his
Documents of Infidelity in the Corruption of my Morals, yet could not forbear
to ſneer at Religion in the Preſence of his Daughter; a Practice in which I
now always concurred, as it faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated the Execution of a Deſign that I had
formed of rendering her ſubſervient to my Pleaſures. I might, indeed,
have married her, and, perhaps, my Couſin ſecretly intended that I
ſhould: But I knew Women too well to think that Marriage would confine my
Wiſhes to a ſingle Object; and I was utterly averſe to a State in which
the Pleaſure of Variety muſt be ſacrificed to domeſtic Quiet, or
domeſtic Quiet to the Pleaſure of Variety; for I neither imagined that I
could long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge myſelf in an unlawful Familiarity <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0242400300:250"/>
with many Women, before it would by ſome Accident be diſcovered to my Wife;
nor that ſhe would be ſo very courteous or philoſophical, as to ſuffer
this Indulgence without Expoſtulation and Clamour; and beſides, I had no
Liking to a Brood of Children, whoſe Wants would ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come importunate,
and whoſe Claim to my Induſtry and Frugality, would be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
acknowledged; though the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of a Miſtreſs might be abandoned to
Beggary, without Breach of the Law, or Offence to Society.</p>
                        <p>THE young Lady, on the contrary, as ſhe perceived that
my Addreſſes exceeded common Civilities, did not queſtion but that my
View was to obtain her for a Wife; and I could diſcern that ſhe often
expected ſuch a Declaration, and ſeemed diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that I had not yet
propoſed an Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to her Father: But imagining, I ſuppoſe, that
theſe Circumſtances were only delayed 'till the fitteſt Opportunity,
ſhe did not ſcruple to admit all the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms that were conſiſtent
with Modeſty; and I drew every Day nearer to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of my
Deſign by inſenſible Approaches, without alarming her Fear, or confirming
her Hopes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0242400300:251"/> I KNEW that only two Things were
neceſſary; her Paſſions were to be inflam'd, and the Motives from which
they were to be ſuppreſſed, removed. I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perpetually
inſinuating, that nothing which was natural, could be ill; I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of
the Impoſitions and Reſtraints of Prieſtcraft and Superſtition; and, as
if theſe Hints were caſual and accidental, I would immediately afterwards
ſing a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Song, repeat ſome ſeducing Verſes, or read a Novel.</p>
                        <p>BUT, henceforward, let never inſulted Beauty admit a
ſecond Time into her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the Wretch, who has once attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to
ridicule Religion, and ſubſtitute other Aids to human Frailty, for that 
<q rend="inline">"Love of GOD which is better than
Life,"</q> and that Fear 
<q rend="inline">"which is the Beginning of Wiſdom:"</q>
For whoever makes ſuch an Attempt, intends to betray; the contrary Conduct
being without Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Intereſt of every one whoſe Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are
good, becauſe even thoſe who profanely deny Religion to be of DIVINE
Origin, do yet acknowledge that it is a Political Inſtitution, well
calculated to ſtrengthen the Band of Society, and to <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0242400300:252"/>
keep out the Ravager, by intrenching In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and arming Virtue. To oppoſe
theſe Corrupters by Argument rather than Contempt, is to parley with a
Murderer, who may be excluded by ſhutting a Door.</p>
                        <p>MY Couſin's Daughter uſed frequently to diſpute with
me, and theſe Diſputes always favoured the Execution of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
Though, leſt I ſhould alarm her too much, I often affected to appear half
in Jeſt; and when I ventured to take any Liberty, by which the Bounds of
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty were ſomewhat invaded, I ſuddenly deſiſted with an Air of
eaſy Negligence; and as the Attempt was not purſued, and nothing farther
ſeemed to be intended than was done, it was regarded but as Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, and
puniſhed only with a Slap or a Frown. Thus ſhe became familiar with
Infidelity and Indecency by Degrees.</p>
                        <p>I ONCE ſubtily engaged her in a Debate, whether the
Gratification of natural Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites was in itſelf innocent, and whether, if
ſo, the Want of external Ceremony could in any Caſe render it criminal. I
inſiſted that Virtue and Vice were not influenced by external Ceremonies,
nor founded upon human Laws, which were <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0242400300:253"/> arbitrary,
temporary, and local: And that as a young Lady's ſhutting herſelf up in a
Nunnery, was ſtill evil, though en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by ſuch Laws; ſo the
tranſmitting her Beauty to Poſterity was ſtill good, though under certain
Circumſtances it had by ſuch Laws been forbidden. This ſhe affected
utterly to deny, and I propoſed that the Queſtion ſhould be referred to
her Papa, without informing him of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and that it ſhould be
determined by his Opinion; a Propoſal to which ſhe readily agreed. I
immediately adverted to other Subjects, as if I had no Intereſt in the
Iſſue of the Debate; but I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it ſunk deeply into her
Mind, and that ſhe continued more thoughtful than uſual.</p>
                        <p>I DID not fail, however, to introduce a ſuitable Topic
of Diſcourſe the next Time my Couſin was preſent, and having ſtated
the Queſtion in general Terms, he gave it in my Favour, without
ſuſpecting that he was Judge in his own Cauſe; and the next Time I was
alone with his Daughter, without mentioning his Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I renewed my
Familiarity; I found her Reſiſtance leſs reſolute, purſued my
Advantage, and compleated her Ruin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0242400300:254"/> WITHIN a few Months ſhe perceived
that ſhe was with Child; a Circumſtance that ſhe communicated to me with
Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the moſt piercing Diſtreſs: But inſtead of
conſenting to marry her, to which ſhe had often urged me with all the
little Arts of Perſuaſion that ſhe could practice, I made Light of the
Affair, chid her for being ſo much alarmed for ſo trivial an Accident, and
propoſed a Medicine which I told her would effectually prevent the
Diſcovery of our Intercourſe, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Effect of it before it
could appear. At this Propoſition ſhe fainted, and when ſhe recovered,
oppoſed it with Terror and Regret, with Tears, Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and Intreaty: But I
continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, and at Length either removed or over-ruled her Scruples,
by the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that had firſt ſeduced her to Guilt.</p>
                        <p>THE long Vacation was now commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and my Clerkſhip
was juſt expired: I therefore propoſed to my Couſin, that we ſhould all
make a Viſit to my Father, hoping that the Fatigue of the Journey would
favour my Purpoſe, by increaſing the Effect of the Medicine, and
account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an Indiſpoſition which it might be ſuppoſed to
cauſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0242400300:255"/> THE Plan being thus concerted, and
my Couſin's Concurrence being obtained, it was immediately put in Execution.
I applied to my old Friend the Club Surgeon, to whom I made no Secret of ſuch
Affairs, and he immediately furniſhed me with Medicaments, which he
aſſured me would anſwer my Purpoſe; but either by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the
Preparation, or in the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, they produced a Diſorder, which, ſoon
after the dear injured unhappy Girl arrived at her Journey's End, terminated in
her Death.</p>
                        <p>MY Confuſion and Remorſe at this Event, are not to be
expreſſed: but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Remorſe were ſuddenly changed into
Aſtoniſhment and Terror; for ſhe was ſcarce dead before I was taken
into Cuſtody, upon Suſpicion of Murder. Her Father had depoſed, that
juſt before ſhe died, ſhe deſired to ſpeak with him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; and
that then, taking his Hand, and intreating his Forgiveneſs, ſhe told him
that ſhe was with Child by me, and that I had poiſoned her, under Pretence
of preſerving her Reputation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0242400300:256"/> WHETHER ſhe made this
Declaration, or only confeſſed the Truth, and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to revenge the
Injury, had forged the reſt, cannot now be known; but the Coroner having been
ſummoned, the Body viewed, and found to have been pregnant, with many Marks
of a violent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Diſorder, a Verdict of Wilful Murder was brought
in againſt me, and I was committed to the County Gaol.</p>
                        <p>AS the Judges were then upon the Circuit, I was within
leſs than a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night convicted and condemned by the Zeal of the Jury,
whoſe Paſſions had been ſo greatly inflamed by the Enormity of the
Crime with which I had been charged, that they were rather willing that I
ſhould ſuffer being innocent, than that I ſhould eſcape being guilty;
but it appearing to the Judge, in the Courſe of the Trial, that Murder was
not intended, he reprieved me before he left the Town.</p>
                        <p>I MIGHT now have redeemed the Time, and, awakened to a
Senſe of my Folly and my Guilt, might have made ſome Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Mankind
for the Injury which I had <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0242400300:257"/> done to Society; and
endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle ſome Spark of Hope in my own Breaſt, by Repentance
and Devotion. But, alas! in the firſt Tranſports of my Mind, upon ſo
ſudden and unexpected a Calamity, the Fear of Death yielded to the Fear of
Infamy, and I ſwallowed Poiſon: The Exceſs of my Deſperation hindered
its immediate Effect; for, as I took too much, great Part of it was thrown up,
and only ſuch a Quantity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained behind, as was ſufficient to inſure my
Deſtruction, and yet leave me Time to contemplate the Horrors of the Gulph
into which I am ſinking.</p>
                        <p>IN this deplorable Situation I have been viſited by the
Surgeon, who was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inſtrument of my Misfortune, and the
Philoſopher who directed my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: But theſe are Friends who only rouze
me to keener Senſibility, and inflict upon me more exquiſite Torment. They
reproach me with Folly, and upbraid me with Cowardice; they tell me too, that
the Fear of Death has made me regret the Errors of Superſtition; but what
would I now give for thoſe erroneous Hopes, and that credulous Simplicity,
which, though I have been taught to deſpiſe them, would 
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0242400300:258"/> ſuſtain me in the tremendous Hour that approaches,
and avert from my laſt Agony the Horrors of Deſpair.</p>
                        <p>I HAVE, indeed, a Viſiter of another Kind, the good old
Man who firſt taught me to frame a Prayer, and firſt animated me with the
Hope of Heaven; but he can only lament with me, that this Hope will not return,
and that I can pray with Confidence no more: He cannot, by a ſudden Miracle,
re-eſtabliſh the Principles which I have ſubverted. My Mind is all Doubt,
and Terror, and Confuſion; I know nothing but that I have rendered
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual the Clemency of my JUDGE, that the Approach of Death is ſwift
and inevitable, and that either the Shades of Everlaſting Night, or the
Gleams of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Fire are at Hand. My Soul, in vain, ſhrinks
backwards: I grow giddy with the Thought: The next Moment is Diſtraction!
Farewell.</p>
