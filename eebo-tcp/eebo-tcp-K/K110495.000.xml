            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS the Writer of this volume could not, for very obvious reaſons, entertain the moſt diſtant inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtanding forth the profeſſed Biographer of LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS, he wiſhes to preclude any undue expectations, by obſerving that, the few memoirs relating to the life of this celebrated Profeſſor, which will be found inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed in the firſt part of this <hi>View,</hi> were almoſt wholly collected from LINNAEUS'S own writings, and other printed works; and ſerve, principally, to relieve the tediouſneſs of a bare account of books, and to connect in a better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the ſeries and occaſion of his publications. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets that his ſources of intelligence have not been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently copious to enable him to render theſe memoirs more equal to his wiſhes, and more worthy the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the public. To thoſe who are converſant with the works of LINNAEUS, he is perfectly aware that theſe pages can afford but little amuſement and ſtill leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and can have no merit in their eye, beyond that of recalling to their remembrance, a ſucceſſion of facts and obſervations, with which they were before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. They will, however, concur with him in wiſhing to diffuſe the knowledge of the writings of ſo great a maſter, and in endeavouring to excite an emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in younger minds, for that ſcience which they cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate.</p>
            <p>All the works of LINNAEUS, as far as they have come to the Author's knowledge, are noticed in the ſucceeding pages; but, as moſt of them were ſubſervient to his great object the SYSTEM <hi>of</hi> NATURE, the <hi>outlines</hi> of that work bear a principal part in this <hi>View</hi> of his writings.</p>
            <p>The CLASSIFICATION <hi>of</hi> DISEASES, is but a ſmall part of his works; yet, as LINNAEUS was an early writer
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0168400500:5"/>
on that ſubject, which has ſince excited the attention of many phyſicians, and is at this day not ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, it hath therefore been exhibited more largely than many of his other writings.</p>
            <p>The AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE, although ſtrictly ſpeaking they are not LINNAEUS'S own works, have yet ſo large a ſhare of his authority ſtamped upon them, are ſo intimately connected with his writings, and, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, are ſo much leſs known than they deſerve to be, that it was judged proper to give a <hi>brief</hi> account of the <hi>whole</hi> collection.</p>
            <p>The PAN SUECUS having been firſt preſented to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reader ſeveral years ago, by the Author of this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, in a periodical publication, is here ſubjoined, with additional obſervations, and ſome improvements in the general arrangement of the tables.</p>
            <p>Few or no criticiſms on the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſyſtem will be found in theſe pages. No ſyſtem yet invented can ſtand a rigorous examination through all its parts, and LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS was, perhaps, better acquainted than any other man with the defects of his own. The ſtudy of nature on ſcientific principles, notwithſtanding the manifold improvements of later years, may yet juſtly be conſidered as in its infancy, and all arrangements hitherto propoſed, have, in their turns, given way to others. At preſent the ſyſtem of LINNAEUS poſſeſſes the advantage of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſuperiority in the public approbation: how long it may enjoy this pre-eminence, time only can diſcover: in the mean while, it would be a more agreeable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to endeavour to ſtrengthen its baſis, ſupply its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiences, and candidly correct its errors, than to <hi>object</hi> to thoſe anomalies and imperfections, which will moſt likely be ever inſeparable from <hi>artificial</hi> arrangements; and as to <hi>natural</hi> method, it is as yet ſo far unknown, that, in the <hi>vegetable</hi> kingdom Botaniſts themſelves are not agreed on what principles it ought to be eſtabliſhed.</p>

            <head>A GENERAL VIEW OF THE WRITINGS OF THE LATE CELEBRATED LINNAEUS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>CHARLES VON LINNÈ, the ſon of a <hi>Swediſh</hi> divine, was born May 24, 1707, at <hi>Roeſhult,</hi> in the province of <hi>Smaland,</hi> in <hi>Sweden;</hi> of which place his father had the cure, when this ſon was born, but was ſoon after preferred to the living of <hi>Stenbrihult,</hi> in the ſame province, where dying in 1748, at the age of 70, he was ſucceeded in his cure by another ſon. We are told, in the commemoration-ſpeech on this celebrated man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in his <hi>Swediſh</hi> majeſty's preſence, before the royal academy of ſciences at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> that the anceſtors of this family took their ſirnames of LINNAEUS, <hi>Lindelius,</hi> and <hi>Tiliander,</hi> from a large <hi>lime-tree,</hi> or <hi>linden-tree,</hi> yet ſtanding on the farm where <hi>Linnaeus</hi> was born; and that this origin of ſirnames, taken from natural objects, is not very uncommon in <hi>Sweden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0168400500:7"/>
This eminent man, whoſe talents enabled him to reform the whole ſcience of natural hiſtory, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated, very early in life, ſome of the higheſt honours that await the moſt ſucceſsful proficients in medical ſcience; ſince we find that he was made <hi>profeſſor</hi> of <hi>phyſic</hi> and <hi>botany,</hi> in the univerſity of <hi>Upſal,</hi> at the age of 34; and ſix years afterwards, phyſician to his ſovereign, the late king <hi>Adolphus;</hi> who in the year 1753 honoured him ſtill farther, by creating him knight of the order of the <hi>Polar Star.</hi> His honours did not terminate here, for in 1757 he was ennobled; and in 1776 the preſent king of <hi>Sweden</hi> accepted the reſignation of his office, and rewarded his declining years by dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his penſion, and by a liberal donation of landed property, ſettled on him and his family.</p>
            <p>It ſeems probable, that his father's example firſt gave <hi>Linnaeus</hi> a taſte for the ſtudy of nature; who, as he has himſelf informed us, cultivated, as his firſt amuſement, a garden plentifully ſtored with plants. Young <hi>Linnaeus</hi> ſoon became acquainted with theſe, as well as the indigenous ones of his neighbourhood. Yet, from the ſtraightneſs of his father's income, our young naturaliſt was on the point of being deſtined to a mechanical employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: fortunately, however, this deſign was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled. In 1717 he was ſent to ſchool at <hi>Wexſio,</hi> where, as his opportunities were enlarged, his progreſs in all his favourite purſuits was propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably extended. At this early period he paid attention to other branches of natural hiſtory; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the knowledge of inſects: in which, as is manifeſt from his <hi>oration</hi> on the ſubject, he muſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0168400500:8"/>
very early have made a great proficiency, ſince we find that he was not leſs ſucceſsful herein, than in that of plants, having given them an arrangement, and eſtabliſhed ſuch characters of diſtinction, as have been univerſally followed by ſucceeding ento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologiſts.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of his academical education, <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> received under profeſſor <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> at <hi>Lund,</hi> in <hi>Scania,</hi> who favoured his inclinations to the ſtudy of natural hiſtory. After a reſidence of about a year, he removed in 1728 to <hi>Upſal.</hi> Here he ſoon contracted a cloſe friendſhip with <hi>Artedi,</hi> a native of the province of <hi>Angermannia,</hi> who had already been four years a ſtudent in that univerſity, and, like himſelf, had a ſtrong bent to the ſtudy of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hiſtory in general, but particularly to <hi>Ich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyology.</hi> He was moreover well ſkilled in chemiſtry, and not unacquainted with botany, having been the inventor of that diſtinction in <hi>umbelliferous</hi> plants, ariſing from the differences of the <hi>involucrum.</hi> Emulation is the ſoul of improvement, and, heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened as it was in this inſtance by friendſhip, proved a moſt powerful incentive. Theſe young men proſecuted their ſtudies together with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vigor, mutually communicating their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and laying their plans, ſo as to aſſiſt each other in every branch of natural hiſtory and phyſic.</p>
            <p>Soon after his reſidence at <hi>Upſal,</hi> our author was alſo happy enough to obtain the favour of ſeveral gentlemen of eſtabliſhed character in litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He was in a particular manner encouraged in the purſuit of his ſtudies by the patronage of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0168400500:9"/>
Dr. <hi>Olaus Celſius,</hi> at that time profeſſor of divinity, and the reſtorer of natural hiſtory in <hi>Sweden;</hi> ſince ſo diſtinguiſhed for oriental learning, and more particularly for his <hi>Hierobotanicon,</hi> or <hi>Critical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertations on the Plants mentioned in Scripture.</hi> This gentleman is ſaid to have given LINNAEUS a large ſhare of his eſteem, and he was fortunate enough to obtain it very early after his removal to <hi>Upſal.</hi> He was at that time meditating his <hi>Hierobotanicon,</hi> and being ſtruck with the diligence of <hi>Linnaeus,</hi> in deſcribing the plants of the <hi>Upſal</hi> garden, and his extenſive knowledge of their names, fortunately for him, at that time involved in difficulties, from the narrow circumſtances of his parents, <hi>Celſius</hi> not only patronized him in a general way, but admitted him to his houſe, his table, and his library. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch encouragement, it is not ſtrange that our author made a rapid progreſs, both in his ſtudies, and the eſteem of the profeſſors: in fact, we have a very ſtriking proof of his merit and attainments, inaſmuch as we find, that after only two years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, he was thought ſufficiently qualified to give lectures occaſionally from the botanic chair, in the room of profeſſor <hi>Rudbeck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1731, the royal academy of ſciences at <hi>Upſal</hi> having for ſome time meditated the deſign of improving the natural hiſtory of <hi>Sweden,</hi> at the inſtance particularly of profeſſors <hi>Celſius</hi> and <hi>Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> deputed LINNAEUS to make the tour of <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the ſole view of exploring the natural hiſtory of that arctic region; to which underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, his reputation, already high as a naturaliſt, and the ſtrength of his conſtitution, equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0168400500:10"/>
him. This tour had been made for the firſt time, with the ſame view, by the elder <hi>Rudbeck,</hi> in 1695, at the command of <hi>Charles</hi> XI; but unfortunately the whole fruit of that expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except two or three copies of the <hi>Campi Elyſii,</hi> periſhed in the dreadful fire of <hi>Upſal,</hi> in 1702.</p>
            <p>As this expedition could not take place till the ſucceeding ſummer, LINNAEUS ſpent his winter with his friends and relations in the ſouth; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly paid a viſit, in January 1732, to his former preceptor <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> at <hi>Lund;</hi> whom he left in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, to viſit his native province of <hi>Smaland,</hi> and returned to <hi>Upſal</hi> about the middle of April, to prepare for his journey. He left <hi>Upſal</hi> the 13th of May, and took his route to <hi>Gevalia,</hi> or <hi>Gevels,</hi> the principal town of <hi>Geſtricia,</hi> 45 miles diſtant from <hi>Upſal.</hi> Hence he travelled through <hi>Helſingland,</hi> into <hi>Medalpadia,</hi> where he made an excurſion, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended a remarkable mountain, before he reached <hi>Hudwickſwald,</hi> the chief town of <hi>Helſingland.</hi> From hence he went through <hi>Angermanland,</hi> to <hi>Hernoſand,</hi> a ſea-port on the <hi>Bothnic</hi> gulph, ſeventy miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from <hi>Hudwickſwald.</hi> When he had proceeded thus far, he found it proper to retard his journey, as the ſpring was not ſufficiently advanced; and took this opportunity of viſiting thoſe remarkable caverns on the ſummit of mount <hi>Skula,</hi> though at the hazard of his life.</p>
            <p>When LINNAEUS arrived at <hi>Uma,</hi> in <hi>Weſt Bothnia,</hi> about 96 miles from <hi>Hernoſand,</hi> he quitted the public road, and took his courſe through the woods weſtward, in order firſt to traverſe the moſt ſouthern parts of <hi>Lapland.</hi> Being now come to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0168400500:11"/>
the country that was more particularly the object of his enquiries, equally a ſtranger to the language and to the manners of the people, and without any aſſociate, he committed himſelf to the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the inhabitants, and never failed to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience it fully. He ſpeaks in ſeveral places, with peculiar ſatisfaction, of the innocence and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their lives, and their freedom from diſeaſes. In this excurſion, he reached the mountains to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Norway,</hi> and, after encountering great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, returned into <hi>Weſt Bothnia,</hi> quite exhauſted with fatigue. He ſeems to have been much ſtruck with the ſingular uſe that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> make of the <hi>Pinguicula vulgaris,</hi> which we call <hi>Butterwort,</hi> or Yorkſhire Sanicle: They receive the milk of the rein-deer upon the freſh leaves of this plant, which they immediately ſtrain off, and ſet aſide, till it becomes ſomewhat aceſcent, and the whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, in a day or two, a conſiſtence equal to that of cream, without ſeparating the ſerum; and by this method it becomes an agreeable food. When thus prepared, a ſmall quantity of the ſame has the property of rennet, in producing the like change on freſh milk. But to return: Our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller next viſited <hi>Pitha</hi> and <hi>Lula,</hi> upon the gulph of <hi>Bothnia,</hi> from which latter place he took again a weſtern route, by proceeding up the river of that name, and viſited the ruins of the temple of <hi>Jock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock,</hi> in <hi>Lula-Lapland</hi> or <hi>Lap-Mark;</hi> thence, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed what is called the <hi>Lapland Deſert,</hi> deſtitute of all villages, cultivation, roads, or any conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences; inhabited only by a few ſtraggling people, originally deſcended from the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> and who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0168400500:12"/>
ſettled in this country in remote ages, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely a diſtinct people from the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> In this diſtrict he aſcended a noted mountain called <hi>Wallevari,</hi> in ſpeaking of which he has given us a pleaſant relation of his finding a ſingular and beautiful new plant <hi>(Andromeda tetragona)</hi> when travelling within the arctic circle, with the ſun in his view at midnight, in ſearch of a <hi>Lapland</hi> hut. From hence he croſſed the <hi>Lapland Alps</hi> into <hi>Finmark,</hi> and traverfed the ſhores of the North ſea as far as <hi>Sallero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe journies from <hi>Lula</hi> and <hi>Pitha,</hi> on the <hi>Bothnian</hi> gulph, to the north ſhore, were made on foot, and our traveller was attended by two <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers;</hi> one his interpreter, and the other his guide. He tells us that the vigour and ſtrength of theſe two men, both old, and ſufficiently loaded with his baggage, excited his admiration, ſince they appeared quite unhurt by their labour, while he himſelf, although young and robuſt, was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently quite exhauſted. In this journey he was wont to ſleep under the boat with which they forded the rivers, as a defence againſt rain, and the gnats, which in the <hi>Lapland</hi> ſummer are not leſs teazing than in the torrid zones. In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending one of theſe rivers, he narrowly eſcaped periſhing by the overſetting of the boat, and loſt many of the natural productions which he had collected.</p>
            <p>LINNAEUS thus ſpent the greater part of the ſummer in examining this arctic region, and thoſe mountains, on which, four years afterwards, the

French philoſophers ſecured immortal fame to Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi> At length, after having ſuffered incredible fatigues and hardſhips, in climbing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, paſſing rivers in miſerable boats, ſuffering repeated viciſſitudes of extreme heat and cold, and not unfrequently hunger and thirſt; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Tornoa</hi> in September. He did not take the ſame route from <hi>Tornoa</hi> as when he came into <hi>Lapland,</hi> having determined to viſit, and examine, the country on the eaſtern ſide of the <hi>Bothnian</hi> gulph: his firſt ſtage, therefore, was to <hi>Ula,</hi> in <hi>Eaſt Bothnia;</hi> from thence to <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Carleby,</hi> 84 miles ſouth from <hi>Ula.</hi> He continued his route through <hi>Waſa, Chriſtianſtedi,</hi> and <hi>Biorneburgh,</hi> to <hi>Abo,</hi> a ſmall univerſity in <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Winter was now ſetting in apace, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore croſſed the gulph by the iſland of <hi>Aland,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Upſal</hi> in November, after having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and that moſtly on foot, a journey of ten degrees of latitude in extent, excluſive of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations which ſuch a deſign rendered neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The <hi>reſult</hi> of this journey was not publiſhed till ſeveral years afterwards, during his reſidence in <hi>Holland.</hi> For the preſent he only gave in to the academy a <hi>Florula Lapponica,</hi> conſiſting of a very few pages in the <hi>Acta Upſalienſia</hi> for the years 1732 and 1734. In this little catalogue the plants are diſpoſed according to the ſyſtem which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called the <hi>ſexual;</hi> and which we ſhould not have mentioned here, but to prove how early <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> had laid the foundation of that method, which he afterwards wrought up to ſuch perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0168400500:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In 1733 he viſited and examined the ſeveral mines in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and made himſelf ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>mineralogy,</hi> and the <hi>docimaſtic</hi> art, that we find he was ſufficiently qualified to give lectures on thoſe ſubjects, upon his return to the univerſity. The outlines of his ſyſtem on mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralogy appeared in the early editions of the <hi>Syſtema Naturae;</hi> but he did not exemplify the whole until the year 1768.</p>
            <p>In the year 1734 LINNAEUS was ſent by Baron <hi>Reuterholm,</hi> governor of <hi>Dalekarlia,</hi> with ſeveral other naturaliſts, into that province, to inveſtigate the natural productions of that part of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> dominions. Each gentleman had his particular department aſſigned; and they noted daily the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations made relating to geography, &amp;c.; but particularly, and as their principal object, the eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical and natural hiſtory, and mineralogy. A full account of theſe obſervations was intended to have been publiſhed, but the deſign was laid aſide. It was in this journey that our author firft laid the plan of an excellent inſtitution, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards executed in a certain degree at leaſt, by himſelf, with the aſſiſtance of many of his pupils, and the reſult publiſhed under the title of <hi>Pan Suecus,</hi> in the ſecond volume of the <hi>Amaenitates Academicae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the completion of this expedition, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that LINNAEUS reſided for a time at <hi>Fahlun,</hi> the principal town in <hi>Dalekarlia;</hi> where he tells us that he taught <hi>mineralogy,</hi> and the <hi>docimaſtic</hi> art, and practiſed phyſic; and where he was very hoſpitably treated by Dr. <hi>More,</hi> the phyſician of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0168400500:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the place. It alſo appears, that he contracted at this time an intimacy with one of that gentleman's daughters, whom he married about five years afterwards, upon his ſettling as a <hi>phyſician</hi> at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this journey he extended his travels quite acroſs the <hi>Dalekarlian Alps</hi> into <hi>Norway;</hi> but we have no particular account of his diſcoveries in that kingdom. From its ſituation, however, in the ſame parallels of latitude and of longitude, nearly, with <hi>Sweden,</hi> as well as from the face of the country, but little variety could be expected; and from the <hi>Flora Norwegica</hi> of Bp. <hi>Gunner,</hi> ſince publiſhed, the vegetable productions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appear to be nearly the ſame, except that the <hi>Norway</hi> coaſt abounds with <hi>fuci</hi> or ſea-wracks, not known in the <hi>Baltic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1735, LINNAEUS travelled over many other parts of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſome parts of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and fixed in <hi>Holland,</hi> where he chiefly reſided until his return to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> about the year 1739. He here took his doctor's degree in phyſic, in June 1735. How clearly the great <hi>Boerhaave</hi> ſaw his merit will appear hereafter. On the preſent occaſion he ſuſtained a <hi>theſis</hi> under the title of HYPOTHESIS NOVA <hi>de febrium inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittentium cauſa.</hi> It is an enquiry into the cauſes of the frequency of that diſtemper in <hi>Sweden,</hi> particularly in <hi>Upland,</hi> and the ſouth-eaſt parts of that kingdom; which he was inclined to attribute to a <hi>local</hi> cauſe, after the moſt minute ſcrutiny into the ſoil and ſituation of thoſe places where this diſtemper was ſo remarkably prevalent and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0168400500:16"/>
obſtinate; and finally propoſes, Whether it might not be owing to the ſtrong impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the water with <hi>argillaceous</hi> particles? Whether or not he afterwards adhered to this opinion, we are uncertain, as it is but juſtice to obſerve, that he did not republiſh this tract himſelf, ſince it was placed at the head of the firſt volume of the <hi>Amaenitates,</hi> printed at <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> as we believe, without his knowledge, by Dr. <hi>Peter Camper.</hi> In the mean time we may obſerve, that howſoever inſufficient this <hi>hypotheſis</hi> may be to ſolve the difficulties that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſearch into the remote cauſes of this diſeaſe; the advocates of the modern theory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it, may think the author's facts, of its frequency in <hi>low</hi> ſituations, confirm and illuſtrate in no ſmall degree their own, according to which it is imputed to <hi>miaſmata</hi> ariſing from moiſt and marſhy ground.</p>
            <p>In this year LINNAEUS alſo publiſhed the firſt ſketch of his <hi>Syſtema Naturae,</hi> in a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way, and in the form of tables only, in twelve pages <hi>in folio.</hi> By this it appears, that he had at a very early period of his life (cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly before he was 24 years old) laid the baſis of that great ſtructure which he afterwards raiſed, not only to the increaſe of his own fame, but to that of natural ſcience.</p>
            <p>In 1736, LINNAEUS came into <hi>England,</hi> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Dr. <hi>Dillenius,</hi> the late learned profeſſor at <hi>Oxford,</hi> whom he juſtly conſidered as one of the firſt botaniſts in <hi>Europe.</hi> He mentions with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſpect the civilities he received from him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0168400500:17"/>
and the privileges he gave him of inſpecting his own, and the <hi>Sherardian</hi> collections of plants. It is needleſs to ſay, that he viſited Dr. <hi>Martyn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rand,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Miller,</hi> and that he was in a more ſingular manner indebted to the friendſhip of Dr. <hi>Iſaac Lawſon.</hi> He alſo <q rend="margQuotes">contracted an intimate friendſhip with Mr. PETER COLLINSON, which was reciprocally increaſed by a multitude of good offices, and continued to the laſt without any diminution.</q> Dr. <hi>Boerhaave</hi> had furniſhed him with letters to our great naturaliſt Sir HANS SLOANE; but, it is with regret that we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, they did not procure him the reception which the warmth of his recommendation ſeemed to claim.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Boerhaave</hi>'s letter to Sir <hi>Hans Sloane,</hi> on this occaſion, is preſerved in the Britiſh Muſeum, and runs thus—<q rend="margQuotes">LINNAEUS, <hi>qui has tibi dabit literas, eſt unice dignus te videre, unice dignus a te videri; qui vos videbit ſimul, videhit hominum par, cui ſimile vix dabit orbis.</hi>
               </q>—This encomium, howſoever quaintly expreſſed, yet was in ſome meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic of <hi>Linnaeus</hi>'s future fame and greatneſs, and proves how intimately <hi>Boerhaave</hi> had penetrated into the genius and abilities of our author; and, ſtrained as this parallel might be thought, it is likely however that the opening of the <hi>ſexual</hi> ſyſtem, ſo different from <hi>Ray's,</hi> by which Sir <hi>Hans Sloane</hi> had always known plants, and particularly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, as they were then called, which LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS had made in altering the names of ſo many <hi>genera,</hi> were rather the cauſe of that coolneſs with which he was received by our excellent naturaliſt.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0168400500:18"/>
Probably we have reaſon to regret this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for otherwiſe LINNAEUS might have obtained an eſtabliſhment in <hi>England,</hi> as it has been thought he wiſhed to have done; and doubtleſs his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities in this kingdom would have been much more favourable to his deſigns, than in thoſe arctic regions where he ſpent the remainder of his days. In the mean time, we may juſtly infer the exalted idea that <hi>Linnaeus</hi> had of <hi>England,</hi> as a land eminently favourable to the improvement of ſcience, from that compliment which, in a letter to a friend, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards paid to <hi>London,</hi> when, ſpeaking of that city, he called it <hi>"Punctum ſaliens in vitello orbis."</hi> However, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> naturaliſts may now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate themſelves on having adopted a moſt excellent diſciple of the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſchool; who, with an illuſtrious aſſociate, ſhared the perils of a navigation round this globe, incited by thirſt of knowledge alone; and who now enjoys that general eſteem among us which is due to his extenſive ſcience, and to his ſingular liberality of mind and manners.</p>
            <p>One of the moſt agreeable circumſtances that happened to LINNAEUS, during his reſidence in <hi>Holland,</hi> aroſe from the patronage of Mr. <hi>Clifford,</hi> in whoſe houſe <note n="*" place="bottom">The country ſeat and garden of Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> was at <hi>Hartcamp,</hi> about three miles from <hi>Haerlem.</hi>
               </note>he lived a conſiderable part of his time, being now as it were the child of fortune:—<hi>Exivi patriâ triginta ſex nummis aureis dives</hi>—are his own words. With Mr. <hi>Clifford,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0168400500:19"/>
however, he enjoyed pleaſures and privileges ſcarcely at that time to be met with elſewhere in the world; that of a garden excellently ſtored with the fineſt exotics, and a library furniſhed with almoſt every botanic author of note. How happy he found himſelf in this ſituation, thoſe only who have felt the ſame kind of ardour can conceive.</p>
            <p>Whilſt in <hi>Holland,</hi> our author was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Boerhaave</hi> to fill the place, then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, of phyſician to the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſettlement at <hi>Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam;</hi> but he declined it, on account of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been educated in ſo oppoſite a climate. He recommended, however, to that department a young German phyſician of great merit, who had the misfortune to fall a ſacrifice, partly to the climate, and partly perhaps to ill uſage from the governor, in half a year after his arrival: A circumſtance which LINNAEUS has very pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically lamented in the <hi>Flora Suecica,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 515, when treating of a plant to which he has given this gentleman's name.</p>
            <p>Beſides being favoured with the particular patronage and friendſhip of <hi>Boerhaave</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clifford,</hi> as is above-mentioned, our author had alſo the pleaſure of being contemporary with, and of reckoning among the number of his friends, many other learned perſons, who have ſince proved orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their profeſſion, and whoſe merit has moſt deſervedly raiſed them to fame and honour. Among theſe we may properly mention Dr. <hi>John Burman,</hi> profeſſor of botany at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> whoſe name and family are well known in the republic of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0168400500:20"/>
letters, to whom our author dedicated his <hi>Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca Botanica,</hi> having been greatly aſſiſted in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling that work, by the free acceſs he had to that gentleman's excellent library; <hi>John Frederick Grono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> editor of <hi>Clayton's Flora Virginica,</hi> and who very early adopted <hi>Linnaeus</hi>'s ſyſtem; Baron <hi>Van Swieten,</hi> late phyſician to the Empreſs Queen; <hi>Iſaac Lawſon,</hi> before-mentioned, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one of the phyſicians to the Britiſh army, who died much regretted at <hi>Ooſterhout,</hi> in the year 1747, and from whom <hi>Linnaeus</hi> received ſingular and very important civilities; <hi>Kramer,</hi> ſince well known for an excellent treatiſe on the Doci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſtic Art; <hi>Van Royen,</hi> botanic profeſſor at <hi>Leyden; Liëberkun,</hi> of <hi>Berlin,</hi> famous for his ſkill in microſcopical inſtruments and experiments. On this occaſion it is not foreign to our plan to remark, that LINNAEUS, being preſent with ſeveral of theſe gentlemen, at a meeting when the latter was exhibiting the animalcules <hi>in ſemine maſculino,</hi> openly declared his opinion, that theſe <hi>moleculae</hi> were not true animalcules; and he appears ever afterwards to have retained the ſame opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to them. To theſe may be added alſo the names of <hi>Albinus</hi> and <hi>Gaubius,</hi> and of others, were it requiſite, to ſhew that our author's talents had very early rendered him conſpicuous, and gained him the regard of all thoſe who cultivated and patronized any branch of medical ſcience; and to which, doubtleſs, the ſingular notice with which <hi>Boerhaave</hi> honoured him, did not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</p>
            <p>Early in the year 1738, after LINNAEUS had left
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0168400500:21"/>
Mr. <hi>Clifford,</hi> and, as it ſhould ſeem, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided with <hi>Van Royen,</hi> at <hi>Leyden,</hi> he had a long and dangerous fit of ſickneſs; and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, went to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was properly entertained by the <hi>Juſſieu's,</hi> at that time the firſt botaniſts in <hi>France.</hi> The opportunity this gave him of inſpecting the Herbaria of <hi>Surian</hi> and <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefort,</hi> and thoſe of the above-named gentlemen, afforded him great ſatisfaction. He had intended to have gone from thence into <hi>Germany,</hi> to viſit <hi>Ludwig,</hi> and the celebrated HALLER, with whom he was in cloſe correſpondence; but he was not able to compleat this part of his intended route, and was obliged to return without this gratification.</p>
            <p>Our author did not fail to avail himſelf of every advantage, that acceſs to the ſeveral muſeums of this country afforded him, in every branch of natural hiſtory; and the number and importance of his publications, during this abſence from his native country, ſufficiently demonſtrate that fund of knowledge which he muſt have imbibed before, and no leſs teſtify his extraordinary application. As theſe works laid the foundation of his future fame, and diſtinguiſhed character, it will be incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on us to enumerate them, and give a brief account of each, as nearly as we can in the order of time in which they were publiſhed, before we accompany our author into <hi>Sweden;</hi> whither he returned to receive at length the reward of his merit.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe was the SYSTEMA NATURAE, <hi>five regna tria Naturae ſyſtematicè propoſita, per</hi>

In this work, which exhibits what LINNAEUS has called the <hi>natural characters</hi> of the <hi>genera</hi> of plants, the <hi>claſſes</hi> are eſtabliſhed upon the <hi>number</hi> or <hi>ſituation,</hi> or both conjointly, of the <hi>ſtamina,</hi> analogically conſidered as the male parts; and the <hi>orders</hi> or ſubdiviſions of the claſſes, upon the <hi>piſtils,</hi> analogous to the female parts: and the <hi>genera</hi> themſelves from the agreement of all the parts of fructification compared with each other, as they agree in <hi>number, figure, ſituation,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</hi> Hence the <hi>Linnaean characters</hi> of plants are applicable to any claſſical method founded on the parts of fructification alone, in which reſpect they have the advantage over thoſe of all foregoing writers, and will probably ſtand firm, even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>claſſical</hi> part of the ſyſtem ſhould be ſet aſide. This is to be conſidered as one of the capital of <hi>Linnaeus</hi>'s works. He tells us, that before the publication of the firſt edition, he had examined the characters of 8000 flowers. Thoſe alone who have been accuſtomed to examine plants with a ſcientific view, can judge how arduous this undertaking muſt have been, and how great the application that he muſt neceſſarily have beſtowed thereon, and that at an early period of life. Neither can any others ſufficiently admire that accuracy with which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0168400500:25"/>
ſo great a number of flowers <hi>have been</hi> examined and compared, or ſee the aptitude of that aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of terms, which were invented by LINNAEUS, to expreſs the different <hi>figure, ſituation,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi> that exiſt in ſuch a variety of ſubjects. If this was a proper place to expatiate upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by extending the idea to all that LINNAEUS has done, reſpecting every other part of plants, as conſidered in their <hi>ſpecific</hi> diſtinctions, it muſt ſtill farther exalt the merit of the author, and place him above all praiſe. At the latter end of this work was given the general plan of a ſyſtem invented by LINNAEUS, and founded upon the different <hi>kinds,</hi> and <hi>arrangement,</hi> of the <hi>calix</hi> or cup of the flower, in plants: but this was omitted in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter editions. Alſo a fragment of that <hi>primum et ultimum</hi> in botany, the <hi>natural method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt edition of this book contained 935 <hi>genera:</hi> the ſixth and laſt, at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> in 1764, hath extended the number to 1239, and the <hi>Mantiſſae</hi> ſince to 1336. It has been thought by ſome, that the firſt idea of the <hi>ſexual</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was received from the writings of <hi>Jungius,</hi> a learned profeſſor, firſt at <hi>Helmſtadt,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>rector</hi> of the Gymnaſium at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> where he died in 1657, and whoſe works contain an uncommon diſplay of original obſervations on the ſubject of plants; and prove him to have been a moſt accurate obſerver of nature. He has not only diſcriminated with peculiar nicety, the ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſeveral parts of plants, but he hath alſo, with equal judgment, ſhewn the impropriety of many of the old generical and ſpecifical diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0168400500:26"/>
and has given rules for forming them anew, that have been of the greateſt ſervice to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in the ſcience, and of which they have not failed to avail themſelves. But <hi>Jungius</hi> did not, however, exhibit any plan, by which it appears that he laid the baſis either of the ſexual, or any other ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>Before the concluſion of the ſame year (1737) our author publiſhed the COROLLARIUM GENERUM, <hi>cui accedit</hi> METHODUS SEXUALIS, in 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer contained only the addition of ſixty new genera of plants; all which were taken into the next edition of the foregoing book; and the latter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits a brief view of the ſexual ſyſtem, as far as reſpects the <hi>claſſes</hi> and <hi>orders.</hi> Neither would it be of importance to mention a ſmall piece publiſhed in the ſame year, during his reſidence with Mr. <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> under the title of VIRIDARIUM CLIFFORTIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUM, were it not incumbent on us to mention all that came from our author's pen.</p>
            <p>In this year, 1737, appeared likewiſe the reſult of the <hi>Lapland</hi> expedition, as far, at leaſt, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the plants of that country; for we are now deprived of the expectation of ever ſeeing the <hi>Lacheſis Lapponica,</hi> intended to complete our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's hiſtory of this country through all its parts. This volume includes the plants of a tract of country not leſs than 100 <hi>Swediſh</hi> miles (nearly equal to 600 <hi>Engliſh)</hi> in length, and 50 in breadth, under the title of FLORA LAPPONICA, <hi>exhibens Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas per Lapponiam creſcentes, ſecundum Syſtema ſexuale, collectas in itinere impenſis Societatis regiae Litterariae et Scientiarum Sueciae An.</hi> 1732 <hi>inſtituto, additis ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymis,</hi>

Amſt.</hi> 1737, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, pp. 372, tab. 12. This work is much more than a bare enumeration of ſynonyms; the preface contains an account of the author's journey, and his acknowledgment to the members of a literary ſociety, by whoſe munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence this work was adorned with the plates, on which are engraven 58 of the more rare, and chiefly <hi>alpine</hi> plants. This is preceded by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> in which the <hi>geographic</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> deſcription of the country is ſet forth, and the difference between the <hi>Alps</hi> and the <hi>Deſart</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly marked; concluding with ſome obſervations on <hi>alpine</hi> plants in general. The work is interſperſed with many very curious obſervations relating to the inhabitants, their ſimplicity of life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, their diſeaſes; the animals of the country; the medical and economical uſes of many of the plants; deſcriptions at large of ſuch as were not well deſcribed before; and critical obſervations, in a botanical way, upon others.</p>

            <p>In this work, moreover, our author has firſt exemplified, what he ever afterwards laboured to bring to its greateſt perfection, in all his writings, and particularly in the <hi>Species Plantarum,</hi> a work not publiſhed till ſixteen years afterwards, <hi>the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific names of plants,</hi> not taken, as had been cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary with former authors, from the colour of the flower, relative ſize of the plant, ſmell, taſte, place of growth, time of flowering, name of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer, virtues, uſes, duration; none of which are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0168400500:30"/>
ſufficiently permanent: but from thoſe invariable and eſſential parts, which fully and clearly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh each ſpecies under the ſame genus, and in the compaſs of ten or twelve words convey ſuch an idea of the plant intended, as will more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſtinguiſh it, than the <hi>verboſe deſcriptions</hi> of many foregoing authors. LINNAEUS has taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible pains with this part of his ſyſtem, which is certainly as difficult as any that leads to the perfection of the ſcience, ſince it depends upon a nice inſpection of <hi>every ſpecies</hi> belonging to each <hi>genus,</hi> and of every <hi>actual variety</hi> belonging to each <hi>ſpecies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The plants of <hi>Lapland</hi> are but few, not amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to more than 537 ſpecies; and in this number are included upwards of an hundred diſcovered by <hi>Linnaeus</hi> in this journey, not known to be natives of <hi>Sweden</hi> before; and of which ſome were non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcripts: among the former, there ſeems to be a propriety in mentioning ſpecially the <hi>Campanula ſerpyllifolia,</hi> or thyme-leaved Bell-flower, which, as it turned out to be a new <hi>genus,</hi> was appropriated to our author by Dr. <hi>J. Gronovius,</hi> and engraved in this volume by the name of LINNAEA.</p>
            <p>No part of LINNAEUS'S writings had given more offence to the contemporary botaniſts, than the liberty he had taken in changing the <hi>generic names</hi> of plants, which had neceſſarily taken place in many inſtances, from the rules eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Fundamenta.</hi> Even DILLENIUS was by no means reconciled to this innovation. LINNAEUS, who had entertained an high opinion of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, having ſaid of him—<hi>nullus eſt in Anglia qui</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0168400500:31"/>
               <hi>genera curat, vel intelligit praeterquam Dillenius</hi>—probably, therefore, dedicated to him his next publication, the CRITICA BOTANICA, <hi>in qua No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina Plantarum generica, et ſpecifica, et variantia exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini ſubjiciuntur, ſelectiora confirmantur, indigna re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jiciuntur, ſimulque doctrina circa Denominationem Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum traditur.</hi> Lugd. Bat. 1737, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, pp. 270. This is a large comment upon the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th parts of the <hi>Fundamenta,</hi> from Aphoriſm 210 to 324 incluſive; in which he has amply explained all his reaſons for theſe alterations; and there were at that time many who ſaw the juſtice of his remarks. <hi>Ludwig</hi> ſays, when ſpeaking of this work—<hi>"rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſus quidem, ſed ſaepiſſime faelix botanicorum cenſor eſt."</hi> The work is rendered very applicable to uſe, by two excellent indexes.</p>
            <p>LINNAEUS printed, at the end of this volume, <hi>Diſcurſus de introducenda in ſcholas et gymnaſia Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae naturalis lectione,</hi> pp. 24, written by Dr. <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallius,</hi> who afterwards defended very ably the ſyſtem of <hi>Linnaeus</hi> againſt profeſſor <hi>Siegeſbeck</hi> of <hi>Peterſburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1737 was likewiſe publiſhed the moſt ſplendid of all our author's writings, the <hi>Hortus Cliffortianus Plantas exhibens quas in Hortis tam vivis quam ſiccis, Hartecampi in Hollandia, coluit Vir Nob. et Gen. Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Clifford, J. U. D. reductis varietatibus ad ſpecies, ſpeciebus ad genera, generibus ad claſſes, adjectis locis plantarum natalibus, differentiiſque ſpecierum.</hi> Amſt. 1737, fol. pp. 501, t. 32. As this book was printed at the expence of Mr. <hi>Clifford,</hi> it is orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with an elegant frontiſpiece, and adorned with ſome of the fineſt engravings of plants that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0168400500:32"/>
are extant, the drawings for which were made with all poſſible accuracy by the late Mr. <hi>Ehret.</hi> By the munificence of Mr. <hi>Clifford,</hi> many of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated botaniſts received a preſent of this book. How rich this garden was in plants, the book will teſtify. They are arranged, as in all our author's ſucceeding works, in the ſexual method; the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are reduced to their ſeveral ſpecies, the natural places of the plants are particularly noticed, many new <hi>genera,</hi> and <hi>ſpecies</hi> under former genera, are introduced, with their deſcriptions at large, and curious obſervations interſperſed throughout the whole. And, what muſt have been more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally acceptable to thoſe who began to reliſh our author's ſyſtem, was, the farther exemplification of his <hi>ſpecific characters,</hi> which the vaſt number of plants included in this work neceſſarily led to. Add to this, that from the copious number of ſynonyms, it is almoſt a <hi>pinax</hi> of every plant therein mentioned; and on this account, as well as others, will yet retain its value, though ſuperſeded in a great degree by the <hi>Species Plantarum.</hi> To the curious and critical botaniſt alſo it is no ſmall ſatisfaction now, to ſee in this volume, compared with later works, the progreſs of the author's own knowledge, manifeſt by the removes and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that better information enabled him to make. In the dedication our author enumerates thoſe patrons who have cultivated botanical gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens ſo greatly to the emolument of the ſcience: he gives a liſt of the <hi>Cliffortian</hi> library, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexes two tables, with explanations of all the variety of leaves, according to his new method
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0168400500:33"/>
of defining them. This addition was very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as the number of plants ſynonymed in this volume amounts to near 2,500. We conclude with <hi>Geſner's</hi> opinion of this work, in a letter to the celebrated <hi>Haller:</hi> 
               <q rend="margQuotes">Opus ſane egregium et acerrimi judicii, nec minoris eruditionis, quo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulter botanicus carebit.—Mihi perplacet ab eo in nominibus ſpecierum notas earum eſſentiales exhiberi, quod ante vix quiſquam botanicus recte praeſtitit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt book which LINNAEUS publiſhed of his own, during his ſtay in <hi>Holland,</hi> was the CLASSES PLANTARUM, <hi>ſeu Syſtemata Plantarum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia a fructificatione deſumta, quorum</hi> 16 <hi>univerſalia et</hi> 13 <hi>partialia, compendioſe propoſita ſecundum claſſes, ordines et nomina generica, cum clave cujuſvis methodi et ſynonymis genericis.</hi> Lugd. Bat. 1738, pp. 656. This work is a very large illuſtration of the ſecond part of the <hi>Fundamenta,</hi> from aphoriſm 53 to 78, and contains a compendious and uſeful view of all the ſyſtems of botany, or methods of claſſing plants, both general and partial, from <hi>Caeſalpinus,</hi> in 1583, who is conſidered as the inventor, to LINNAEUS himſelf in 1735. To the generical name in every ſyſtem, he has added that by which it ſtands in his own, which is a great advantage in the uſe of this book. A new edition, with the requiſite additions, would be very acceptable to the public even now. The ſyſtems at large that are diſplayed in this book, are thoſe of <hi>Caeſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus, Moriſon, Ray, Knaut, Herman,</hi> and <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> founded on the fruit: <hi>Rivinus, Ruppius, Ludwig,</hi> and <hi>Knaut,</hi> on the number of petals in the flower: <hi>Tournefort</hi> and <hi>Pontedera,</hi> on the figure of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0168400500:34"/>
ſame: and of <hi>Magnol</hi> and LINNAEUS, on the cup of the flower. After theſe follow LINNAEUS'S ſexual ſyſtem, and his fragments of the natural method. We ſay nothing of the arrangement of <hi>particular</hi> claſſes, ſuch are the <hi>compoſite</hi> flowers, the <hi>umbelliferous</hi> plants, the <hi>graminaceous,</hi> the <hi>ferns,</hi> &amp;c. A very large index, referring to every <hi>genus</hi> in each ſyſtem, concludes the volume.</p>
            <p>LINNAEUS, whilſt in <hi>Holland,</hi> ſuſtained a very ſevere loſs in the premature death of his friend and fellow ſtudent <hi>Artedi;</hi> with whom, as has been before obſerved, he had contracted the firmeſt friendſhip whilſt they reſided at <hi>Upſal;</hi> inſomuch that they had, in caſe of death, mutually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to each other their manuſcripts and collections in natural hiſtory. <hi>Artedi</hi> had been particularly aſſiduous in arranging anew, and deſcribing all ſuch fiſhes as had fallen under his own inſpection; and had taken a voyage to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in 1734, to give more perfection to his plan. Our author, after his death, procured, though with ſome difficulty, all <hi>Artedi</hi>'s papers, and put the finiſhing hand to them, and publiſhed them at <hi>Leyden</hi> in 1738, in octavo, under the title of <hi>Petri Artedi, Sueci Medici,</hi> ICHTHYOLOGIA: <hi>ſive opera omnia de piſcibus, ſcilicet Bibliotheca Ichthyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logica; Philoſophia Ichthyologica; Genera Piſcium; Synonymia Specierum; Deſcriptiones Specierum. Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia in hoc genere perfectiora quam antea ulla. Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huma vindicavit, recognovit, cooptavit, et edidit, Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> LINNAEUS. In this work fiſhes are arranged in an entire new method, and which our author adopted with little or no variation, and continued
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0168400500:35"/>
through all the former editions of his <hi>Syſtem</hi> to the tenth; when he removed the <hi>cetaceous</hi> order into the claſs of the <hi>mammalia;</hi> and inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in the remaining orders the diſtinctions ariſing from the <hi>bony</hi> or <hi>cartilaginous</hi> texture of the <hi>fins;</hi> he eſtabliſhed them on the <hi>ſituation</hi> of the <hi>ventral fins,</hi> which he conſiders as analogous to the feet in other animals, as they are placed either before, underneath, or behind the <hi>pectoral fins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this work <hi>Artedi</hi> has exhibited an inſtance of genius, labour, and application, that cannot fail to excite the greateſt regret at his early death. He has given to <hi>Ichthyology</hi> that degree of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which his friend afterwards extended through all the animal kingdom, and which muſt remain a laſting monument of his abilities. In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, his deſcriptions of the indigenous fiſhes of <hi>Sweden,</hi> are ſcientific to a degree that had never before been ſeen; and we cannot ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the pains he muſt have taken to extricate the ſynonyms from every author on the ſubject. <hi>Artedi,</hi> after his return from <hi>England,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, at the recommendation of LINNAEUS, by <hi>Seba</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to complete that part of his <hi>Theſaurus</hi> relating to fiſhes, and was unfortunately drowned in one of the canals in that city. LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS, in a ſhort account of the author's life, has lamented his untimely deceaſe, in a manner which does no leſs honour to his friend than to his own feelings.</p>
            <p>We muſt now accompany our author into <hi>Sweden,</hi> whither he returned about the latter end
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0168400500:36"/>
of the year 1738, or the beginning of the next, and ſettled as a phyſician at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> where he ſeems to have met with conſiderable oppoſition, and was oppreſſed with many difficulties; all of which at length he overcame, and got into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive practice; and, ſoon after his ſettlement, married the lady before ſpoken of. By the intereſt of Count <hi>Teſſin,</hi> who was afterwards his great patron, and even procured medals to be ſtruck in honour of him, he obtained the rank of phyſician to the fleet, and a ſtipend from the citizens for giving lectures in botany. And what at this time eſpecially was highly favourable to the advancement of his character and fame, by giving him an opportunity of diſplaying his abilities, was the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Royal Academy of Sciences</hi> at <hi>Stockholm;</hi> of which LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS was conſtituted the firſt preſident, and to which eſtabliſhment the king granted ſeveral pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, particularly that of free poſtage to all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers directed to the ſecretary. By the rules of the academy, the preſident held his place but three months, at the expiration of which, he made his ORATIO <hi>de memorabilibus in Inſectis,</hi> Oct. 3, 1739; in which he endeavours to excite an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and enquiry into the knowledge of inſects, by diſplaying the many ſingular <hi>phaenomena</hi> that occur in contemplating the nature of thoſe animals, and by pointing out, in a variety of inſtances, their uſefulneſs to mankind in particular, and to the economy of nature in general.</p>
            <p>During all this time, however, LINNAEUS appears to have had his eye upon the botanic and medical
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0168400500:37"/>
chair at <hi>Upſal,</hi> at this time occupied by <hi>Rudbeck,</hi> who was far advanced in life. We learn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that he was ſo intent on purſuing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, his great deſigns in the advancement of his favourite ſtudy of nature, that he had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, if he failed in procuring the profeſſorſhip at <hi>Upſal,</hi> to accept the offer that had been made to him by <hi>Haller,</hi> of filling the botanic chair at <hi>Gottingen.</hi> However, in courſe of time, he obtained his wiſh. In the year 1741, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of <hi>Roberg,</hi> he was conſtituted joint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of phyſic, and phyſician to the king, with <hi>Roſen,</hi> who had been appointed in the preceding year on the death of <hi>Rudbeck.</hi> Theſe two col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues agreed to divide the medical departments between them; and their choice was confirmed by the univerſity. <hi>Roſen</hi> took anatomy, phyſiology, pathology, and the therapeutic part. LINNAEUS, natural hiſtory, botany <hi>materia medica,</hi> the dietetic part, and the <hi>diagnoſis morborum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the interval of his removal from <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm</hi> to <hi>Upſal,</hi> in conſequence of this appointment, our profeſſor was deputed by the ſtates of the kingdom, to make a tour to the iſlands of <hi>Oëland</hi> and <hi>Gothland,</hi> in the <hi>Baltic,</hi> attended by ſix of the pupils, commiſſioned to make ſuch enquiries as might tend to improve agriculture, and arts, in the kingdom; to which the <hi>Swediſh</hi> nation had for ſome time paid a particular attention; awakened, as it were, by the deſolating wars of <hi>Charles</hi> the XIIth, to extend their commerce, and cultivate the arts of peace. The reſult of this journey was very ſucceſsful, and proved fully ſatisfactory to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0168400500:38"/>
the States, and was afterwards communicated to the public.</p>
            <p>LINNAEUS, on his return, entered upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſorſhip, and pronounced before the univerſity his ORATION <hi>de Peregrinationum intra Patriam neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate,</hi> Oct. 17, 1741; in which he forcibly diſplays the uſefulneſs of ſuch excurſions, by pointing out to the ſtudents that vaſt field of objects which their country held out to their cultivation; whether in geography, phyſics, mineralogy, botany, zoology, or economics; and by ſhewing the benefit that muſt accrue to themſelves and their country as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to their diligence. That animated ſpirit which runs through the whole of this compoſition, renders it one of the moſt pleaſing and inſtructive of all our author's productions. That intimate knowledge which LINNAEUS himſelf had acquired of his own country by his repeated travels (fraught as he was too with every requiſite for making uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obſervations) enabled him to point out with the utmoſt preciſion the moſt proper objects of inveſtigation, in every part of nature; and his love to his country gave a zeal to his wiſhes, that ſhewed him on this occaſion to great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; not to add, the aid ariſing from that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congratulation, which he muſt feel, having juſt gained, by his late appointment, the ſummit of his wiſhes.</p>
            <p>The ITER OELANDICUM ET GOTLANDICUM, in 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, pp. 284, were printed at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> in 1745, in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> language; as was alſo the ITER SCANICUM, in 1751, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, pp. 435. We cannot help regretting that theſe <hi>Itinera</hi> have not made
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0168400500:39"/>
their appearance in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or ſome other language beſides that of <hi>Sweden;</hi> for though, in a country cultivated like ours, many hints, perhaps, might not be drawn from theſe volumes, of real importance to agriculture <hi>here;</hi> yet they are ſo replete with curious and philoſophical obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they could not fail to be an acceptable preſent to the public; as the general ſcope of theſe volumes is to adapt natural hiſtory to eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical purpoſes. In the <hi>Iter Gothlandicum et Oelandicum,</hi> LINNAEUS'S inſtructions were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected principally to theſe particulars:—He was to endeavour to find ſome kind of earth proper for making pottery-ware in imitation of the porcelaine of <hi>China:</hi> he was to notice every production of nature that might ſuperſede the neceſſity of the importation of any article, uſed either in phyſic or manufactures: and in fine, he was to have a regard to every part of natural hiſtory. In the execution of his plan, however, he went much farther than his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion extended, having interſperſed a number of obſervations relating to the antiquities of theſe iſlands, the mechanic arts, to the manners of the people, their fiſhery, and various other articles. He was, as might reaſonably be expected, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful in the firſt part of his commiſſion, ſince the two iſlands are almoſt entirely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of limeſtone, or coral rocks, which abound in a remarkable degree in the <hi>Baltic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a proof of the little attention that had been paid to natural hiſtory in <hi>Sweden,</hi> we may obſerve,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0168400500:40"/>
that our author in this journey diſcovered above an hundred plants, which before were not known to be indigenous; many of which were ſuch as are uſed in phyſic, and in dyeing. He pointed out to the natives ſeveral plants of great uſe in ruſtic economy, and ſhewed them the advantage of planting the Sea-reed graſs <hi>(Arundo arenaria)</hi> to arreſt the ſand, and form ſoil on the ſhores; to which it is extremely well adapted by the length of the roots. In the ITER OELANDICUM there occurs a curious remark in vegetation, confirming the annual increaſe of the wood in an oak-tree, in which was perfectly diſtinguiſhed the hard winters of 1578, 1687, and 1709, by the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the circles in thoſe years. He deſcribes the proceſs for making tar, as practiſed by theſe iſlanders; and further, interſperſes many obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions relating to mineralogy in general; to iron in particular, with which <hi>Sweden</hi> abounds; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the iron mountain <hi>Taberg,</hi> (See <hi>Phil. Tranſact.</hi> vol. xlix. p. 30.) the alum mines of <hi>Mockleby;</hi> the <hi>Poma chryſtallina,</hi> or <hi>aëtites marmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi> which illuſtrates the formation of chryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the ITER SCANICUM, performed in 1749, our author treats largely on the culture of marſhy grounds; on the uſeful and noxious herbs, for inſtance, the <hi>Stakan,</hi> ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Phellan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drium aquaticum,</hi> or <hi>Water Hemlock,</hi> which it is believed renders horſes that eat it paralytic; on the <hi>Gramen Mannae,</hi> or <hi>Feſtuca fluitans,</hi> the ſeeds of which are ſo particularly uſeful in fattening geeſe; on the <hi>Agaricus muſcarius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

In 1743, on occaſion of conferring a degree on Dr. <hi>J. Weſtman,</hi> the profeſſor delivered his third ORATION <hi>de Telluris habitabilis incremento:</hi> an elaborate and ingenious defence of that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, which Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> and ſeveral other philoſophers, have inclined to, <q rend="margQuotes">That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of water on the globe of this earth is conſtantly decreaſing.</q> This leads the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor alſo to diſcuſs the 132d ſection of the <hi>Philoſophia—Initio rerum ex omni ſpecie viventium unicum ſexus par creatum fuiſſe ſuadet ratio.</hi>—The viſible receſſion of the waters of the ſea in divers parts of the earth, particularly apparent in the <hi>Baltic,</hi> had inclined the <hi>Swediſh</hi> philoſophers to this opinion of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s. The poſition of the <hi>Philoſophia,</hi> he thinks naturally deducible from the foregoing hypotheſis, and neceſſarily ſo from the <hi>Moſaic</hi> hiſtory. In ſolving the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties attending the latter part of the hypotheſis, he is led by his ſubject to enter largely into a part of the economy of nature, which renders his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe highly intereſting, independently of ali con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures relating to the main argument: this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the various ways in which vegetables are diſſeminated, and by which they find their way to every part of the globe. To this effect winds, rain, rivers, the ſea, animals, &amp;c. are all ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient, as well as the various ſtructure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the ſeeds themſelves; in illuſtrating which laſt affair the profeſſor has taken great pains, and conſtructed tables of the genera, founded on theſe different properties of the ſeeds. In the introduction to this oration, our author turns the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0168400500:42"/>
attention of his readers to ſome of the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable diſcoveries that had lately been made in natural hiſtory and philoſophy; ſuch were thoſe relating to the <hi>Polype, Rattleſnake,</hi> and the <hi>Senega,</hi> &amp;c.; among others alſo, he mentions a remarkable fact that had been communicated by <hi>Sauvages</hi> of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> reſpecting the effect of the berries of the <hi>Coriaria myrtifolia,</hi> Spec. pl. 1467 (Myrtle-leaved Sumach) in occaſioning inſtant epilepſy.</p>
            <p>The three orations of LINNAEUS are ſubjoined to the ſecond volume of the <hi>Amoenitates Academicae,</hi> printed in 1752.</p>
            <p>In 1745, the profeſſor publiſhed his FLORA SUECICA <hi>exhibens Plantas per Regnum Sueciae creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes, ſyſtematice cum differentiis ſpecierum, ſynonymis autorum, nominibus incolarum, ſolo locorum, uſu Pharmacopoeorum,</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, Holm. pp. 392, 1745; and again, with many additions, in 1755, pp. 464. The firſt edition contains 1140 plants. In the ſecond they are increaſed, by his own, and the diſcoveries of his pupils, to 1296. No generical characters are introduced into this work, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences made to them as they ſtand in the <hi>Genera Plantarum,</hi> before ſpoken of. A number of ſelect <hi>ſynonyma</hi> is added to his own ſpecific name, under each plant; and not only the <hi>Swediſh</hi> names in general, but the <hi>provincial</hi> ones: highly worthy this of imitation in works of this kind, and quite ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in ſo extenſive a kingdom. Many of the rare plants are deſcribed at large, and botanical criticiſms added to many others. In the laſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the author has interſperſed a great number
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0168400500:43"/>
of curious obſervations relating to the economical and medical uſes of the plants; and has particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly noted thoſe that are capable of being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the purpoſes of dyeing. The author moreover never fails to mention <hi>euporiſtic</hi> medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which he ſeems to think, perhaps very juſtly, have not been attended to by phyſicians as they deſerve. The plan of this work has been a pattern for all ſucceeding writers of <hi>local</hi> cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, more eſpecially thoſe who have followed the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſyſtem, and has been very little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by any; perhaps excelled by none. The plants of <hi>Lapland</hi> are all included in this work; and the preface, beſides the account of <hi>Swediſh</hi> authors on botany, contains a curious diviſion of the ſeveral provinces of the kingdom, in reſpect to their different ſoils and ſituation, as adapted to particular plants, ſpecifying under each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the plants found therein.</p>
            <p>In 1746 appeared the FAUNA SUECICA, <hi>ſiſtens Animalia Sueciae Regni: Mammalia, Aves, Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, Piſces, Inſecta, Vermes; diſtributa per claſſes et ordines, genera et ſpecies, &amp;c. Stockholm</hi> 1746, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>; and again, greatly augmented, in 1761, pp. 556. The firſt edition contained 1350 ſubjects, the latter comprehends not leſs than 2266. Neither in this work are any <hi>claſſical, ordinal,</hi> or <hi>generical</hi> notes given at large. The world had never ſeen ſo compendious, and it may be truly ſaid, at the ſame time, ſo complete a <hi>zoology</hi> before. Here, as in plants, the author has given to each animal a new ſpecific name, expreſſive, as far as poſſible, of its eſſential character. The <hi>ſynonyms</hi> are added,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0168400500:44"/>
or referred to, from almoſt every author on the ſubject, and almoſt every animal is moreover com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſly deſcribed. <hi>Inſects</hi> make a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of this catalogue; near 1700 ſpecies, all found in that kingdom, are enumerated, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and methodized, in a manner entirely new, and which has been adopted by nearly every writer on the ſubject ſince. We ſhall ſpeak more fully of the claſſification in the abſtract intended to be given of the <hi>Syſtema Naturae.</hi> A compendious manual of <hi>Engliſh Zoology</hi> on this plan, is a work much wanted; though we think it could not fail to enhance its value, if the tables of the genera were prefixed to each claſs, and the characters to each genus, as in the <hi>Syſtem</hi> of our author. Two plates, of ſome of the rarer birds chiefly, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this volume, on which are explained the technical terms uſed in <hi>ornithology.</hi> The number of each claſs of animals ſtands thus:

            <p>An accident having thrown into the hands of the profeſſor an <hi>Herbarium,</hi> conſiſting of five large volumes of plants, he diſcovered that it was the collection of the famous Dr. <hi>Paul Herman,</hi> which had been made in the iſland of <hi>Zeylon,</hi> by that gentleman, at the expence of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Eaſt India Company. This <hi>Herbarium</hi> had been loſt for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of half a century, until chance threw it into the hands of M. <hi>Gunther,</hi> apothecary to the king of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who ſent it to LINNAEUS, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0168400500:45"/>
the profeſſor to examine it, and affix the names to the plants of this ſuperb collection. Its great value, as being collected by ſo eminent a man, induced our author to examine the whole with great attention; and he was thereby enabled to form many new <hi>genera,</hi> and ſettle many doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpecies. He publiſhed the reſult of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under the title of FLORA ZEYLANICA, <hi>ſiſtens Plantas indicas Zeylonae Inſulae, quae olim</hi> 1670—1677 <hi>lectae fuere, à Paulo Hermanno Profeſſore Botan. Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſi; demum poſt</hi> 70 <hi>annos ab A. Gunthero orbi redditae.</hi> Holm. 1747, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, pp. 254, tab. 4.</p>
            <p>This work is yet of uſe as a <hi>pinax</hi> of theſe plants, and as a <hi>Linnaean</hi> catalogue of <hi>Burman</hi>'s <hi>Theſaurus Zeylanicus,</hi> publiſhed in 1738, and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated with the figures of upwards of 200 of theſe plants. Many of the rare ſpecies are deſcribed, and a very copious number of ſynonyms added to ſeveral of the <hi>Eaſt Indian</hi> plants. The <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barium</hi> conſiſted of about 660 plants, of which the true places in the ſyſtem are aſſigned to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 400, and the remainder were too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect to admit of diſtinction. This volume is rendered valuable by a conciſe hiſtory of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of botany, from the reſtoration of learning in the 16th century; a natural hiſtory of the iſland, and its general produce; the life of Dr. <hi>Herman;</hi> a ſhort account of <hi>J. Hartog,</hi> who was ſent by Dr. <hi>Sherard</hi> to make collections in this iſland; and of <hi>Burman</hi>'s <hi>Theſaurus Zeylanicus.</hi> LINNAEUS authenticates this <hi>Herbarium</hi> to have been <hi>Herman</hi>'s, by ſhewing that the numbers, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0168400500:46"/>
the plants, anſwer to his <hi>Muſeum Zeylanicum,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1717.</p>
            <p>We now ſee LINNAEUS fixed in the ſituation that was ſo well adapted to his character, his taſte, and abilities, and which ſeems to have been the object of his ambition, and center of his hopes. Soon after his eſtabliſhment, he laboured to get the Academical Garden, which had been founded in 1657, put on a better footing, and very ſoon effected it; procuring alſo a houſe to be built for the reſidence of the profeſſor. The whole had been in ruin ever ſince the fire in 1702, and at the time <hi>Linnaeus</hi> was appointed profeſſor of botany, the garden did not contain above 50 plants that were exotic. His correſpondence with the firſt botaniſts in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſoon ſupplied him with great variety. He received <hi>Indian</hi> plants from <hi>Juſſieu</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> and from <hi>Van Royen</hi> of <hi>Leyden; European</hi> plants from <hi>Haller</hi> and <hi>Ludwig; American</hi> plants from the late Mr. <hi>Collinſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cateſby,</hi> and others; and variety of annuals from <hi>Dillenius:</hi> in ſhort, how much the garden owed to his diligence and care, in a few years, may be ſeen by the catalogue publiſhed under the title of HORTUS UPSALIENSIS <hi>exhibens Plantas exoticas horto Upſalienſis Academiae a ſeſe</hi> (Linnaeo) <hi>illatas ab anno</hi> 1742, <hi>in annum</hi> 1748, <hi>additis, differentiis ſynonymis, habitationibus, hoſpitiis, rariorumque deſcriptionibus, in gratiam ſtudioſae ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventutis.</hi> Holm. 1748, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, pp. 306, tab. 3. By this catalogue it appears that the profeſſor had introduced 1100 ſpecies, excluſive of all the <hi>Swediſh</hi> plants, and of varieties; which latter, in ordinary gardens, amount not unfrequently
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0168400500:47"/>
to one third of the whole number. The preface contains a curious hiſtory of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate at <hi>Upſal,</hi> and the progreſs of the ſeaſons through the whole year. From theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we learn, that the greateſt degree of heat, in the ſummer of 1747, at <hi>Upſal,</hi> was on the ſecond day of <hi>July,</hi> when <hi>Celſius</hi>'s thermometer ſtood at 30 degrees above 0; that the greateſt degree of cold, on the 25th of <hi>January</hi> 1740, was 28 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees below 0. In this thermometer the freezing point is 0, and boiling water 100. From ſeven years obſervations on the <hi>leafing</hi> of the oak, it was found never to puſh before the 6th of <hi>May,</hi> or to be retarded beyond the 22d.</p>
            <p>About this period it was, that LINNAEUS made a remarkable diſcovery, relating to the generation of pearls in the <hi>river Pearl-Muſcle</hi> (Mya Margaritifera, Syſt. 1112.) This ſhell-fiſh muſt not be confounded with what is called the <hi>Mother of Pearl Shell,</hi> as that belongs to another genus, is a ſea-ſhell, and an inhabitant of the warmer countries only. The ſhell-fiſh in queſtion is found in <hi>rivers,</hi> in all the northern parts of the world; in <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> it abounds; it is found in the rivers of the county of <hi>Tyrone</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in thoſe of <hi>Done<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall;</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Don</hi> is ſaid to abound with it; and it is not unfrequent in the rivers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> This fiſh will bear removal remarkably well; and it is ſaid, that in ſome places they form reſervoirs for the purpoſe of keeping it, and taking out the pearl, which, in a certain period of time, will be again renewed. From obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the growth of theſe ſhells, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0168400500:48"/>
of their annular <hi>laminae,</hi> or ſcales, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the fiſh will attain a very great age; 50 or 60 years are imagined to be a moderate computation. The diſcovery turned on a method, which LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS found, of putting theſe muſcles into a ſtate of producing pearls at his pleaſure; though the final effect did not take place for ſeveral years: he ſays, that in 5 or 6 years after the operation the pearl would have acquired the ſize of a <hi>Vetch.</hi> We are unacquainted with the means by which he accompliſhed this extraordinary ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but it was probably publiſhed at the time, and conſidered as important, ſince it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the author was rewarded with a munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>praemium,</hi> from the States of the kingdom, on this account. We regret that we cannot ſpeak more fully on this head; but may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it is probable, from a paper publiſhed many years afterwards in the <hi>Berlin</hi> Acts, that the method conſiſted in injuring the ſhell externally, perhaps by a perforation; as it has been obſerved, that theſe concretions in ſhell-fiſh are found on the inſide, exactly oppoſite to perforations and injuries made from without by <hi>ſerpulae,</hi> and other animals.</p>
            <p>From the time that LINNAEUS and <hi>Roſen</hi> were appointed profeſſors at <hi>Upſal,</hi> it ſhould ſeem that the credit of that univerſity, as a ſchool of phyſic, had been increaſing; and the fact in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is certain, that numbers of ſtudents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thither from <hi>Germany,</hi> attracted by the character of theſe two able men: and certainly in <hi>Sweden</hi> itſelf, many young men were invited to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0168400500:49"/>
the ſtudy of phyſic, by the excellent manner in which it was taught, who otherwiſe would have engaged in different purſuits. We muſt not deviate into the line of <hi>Roſen</hi>'s department: ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to ſay, that theſe two eminent men, by their united zeal and abilities, failed not to exalt, together with their own fame, that of their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. LINNAEUS, in teaching the <hi>diagnoſis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum,</hi> had adopted the plan, with ſome alteration, of M. <hi>Sauvages</hi>'s Noſology, of which we ſhall be led to give ſome account hereafter. In the year 1749, he publiſhed, for the uſe of his ſtudents, MATERIA MEDICA, <hi>Liber I. de Plantis digeſtus ſecundum genera, loca, nomina, qualitates, vires, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentias, durationes, ſimplicia, modos, uſus, ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, culturas, praeparata, potentias, compoſita.</hi> Holm. 1749, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, pp. 252. The compendious method in which this work is executed, and the ſeveral uſeful preliminary papers annexed, render it a very uſeful and inſtructive manual to ſtudents in medicine. A <hi>materia medica</hi> of the vegetable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in which every ſimple was aſcertained by ſo able a botaniſt as LINNAEUS, was a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable acquiſition to ſcience. In this volume are arranged 535 ſubjects, and ſeveral are for the firſt time reduced to their proper <hi>genera;</hi> ſuch are the <hi>Ipecacuanha, Pareira brava, Coculi Indici,</hi> and others. The method purſued in this volume is as follows. The author gives,</p>

            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Swediſh officinal</hi> name, what part is in uſe, or what preparation of it, if any; and the doſes of each.</p>

            <p>In the year 1749 was publiſhed the firſt volume of a collection of <hi>Theſes</hi> in 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, under the title of <hi>Amoenitates Academicae, ſeu Diſſertationes variae, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicae, medicae, et botanicae.</hi> This publication has
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0168400500:51"/>
been continued, from time to time, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the ſeventh volume in the year 1769. <hi>Holm.</hi> Theſe volumes, as ſoon as publiſhed, were conſtantly reprinted in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> As theſe academical diſſertations were ſuſtained under LINNAEUS in his profeſſorial character, and were ſelected by himſelf, they have been regarded as of equal authority nearly with his own writings; and many of them do in a particular manner extend and exemplify divers parts of his works, the ſubjects having been pointed out by himſelf, in many inſtances, for that purpoſe. For theſe reaſons we ſhall, in the courſe of this volume, give a very brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the purport of each diſſertation, ſince they contain a great variety of curious intelligence on the ſubjects of phyſic and natural hiſtory, every where digeſted in the moſt ſcientific taſte.</p>
            <p>Whilſt LINNAEUS was meditating one of his capital performances, which had long been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and greatly wiſhed for, he was interrupted by a very long and painful fit of the gout, which left him in a very weak and diſpirited ſtate; and, according to the intelligence that his friends gave of him, nothing was thought to have contributed more to the reſtoration of his ſpirits, than the ſeaſonable acquiſition, at this juncture, of a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of rare and undeſcribed plants.</p>
            <p>Upon the recovery of his health, he publiſhed his book; PHILOSOPHIA BOTANICA <hi>in qua expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur fundamenta botanica cum definitionibus partium, exemplis terminorum, obſervationibus rariorum, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectis</hi>

This muſt be conſidered as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſyſtem of botany, and is a work which none, who wiſh to be acquainted with the ſexual ſyſtem, can be without, as it is the author's own comment on his <hi>Fundamenta,</hi> firſt publiſhed in 1736, and which are comprized in 365 aphoriſms, divided into 12 chapters. The author's original intention was to have explained all theſe aphoriſms at large, in the manner that had been done in the <hi>Bibliotheca Botanica, Claſſes Plantarum, Sponſalia Plantarum, Critica Botanica,</hi> and <hi>Vires Plantarum;</hi> but he ſays his numerous avocations did not allow him requiſite time.</p>

Of the <hi>umbelliferous</hi> plants, ſuch as grow in <hi>dry</hi> places are aromatic, and conſidered as ſudorifics and carminatives: thoſe growing in <hi>watery</hi> places, on the contrary, are moſtly of a quality to be juſtly ſuſpected, and not a few of them quite <hi>noxious.</hi> Plants of the <hi>papilionaceous</hi> claſs are all excellent food for cattle.

            <p>In this work of LINNAEUS it is difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether we ought moſt to admire the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of its author in his inventive power, or that exquiſite ſcientific arrangement which he has given to the whole; and which, both together, conſtitute this a moſt excellent performance.</p>

            <p>In 1753, appeared the Profeſſor's <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Opus maximum et aeternum,</hi>
               </q> the SPECIES PLANTARUM <hi>exhibentes Plantas rite cognitas, ad genera relatas, cum differentiis ſpecificis, nominibus trivialibus, ſynonymis ſelectis, locis natalibus, ſecundum ſyſtema ſexuale di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtas.</hi> Tom. II. <hi>Holm.</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, 1753, pp. 1200; and a ſecond time in 1762, pp. 1684. To give this work its utmoſt perfection, had been the author's object for many years, and to this all his other bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic productions are in ſome meaſure only prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; eſpecially the <hi>local</hi> catalogues; as the rightly aſcertaining the <hi>ſpecies</hi> is the great object of all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. In this work <hi>Linnaeus</hi> takes in every plant that had come ſufficiently under his <hi>own</hi> inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſeldom admitting any on the authority of others; and whereſoever he has done it, the plant is diſtinguiſhed by a proper mark. The plan of this work is, in general, agreeable to that of all his other local catalogues; no other part of the ſyſtem being exemplified except the <hi>ſpecies:</hi> and as it is entirely botanical, none of the uſes of the plants are here introduced. Every plant has its <hi>ſpecific</hi> name, conſtructed according to the rules eſtabliſhed in the eighth part of the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophia Botanica,</hi> with a reference to all, or any of his own works, in which it has been mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0168400500:56"/>
and the ſynonym is given, if it be different from the preſent. Then follow the ſynonyms of the beſt authors, and conſtantly, where the plant is at all rare, or newly-diſcovered, there is a reference to the beſt figures. The country in which the plant grows is then added, and frequently a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol, expreſſive of its duration, whether annual, biennial, or perennial.</p>
            <p>In this work, for the firſt time, the profeſſor has given to each plant, what he calls a <hi>trivial</hi> name: that is, a ſingle epithet, which may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, as far as poſſible, of the <hi>eſſential ſpecific</hi> difference, among the ſpecies of the genus: this, however, can take place but rarely; in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it is expreſſive of ſome, the moſt ſtriking and obvious difference; and not ſeldom it is a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal term; or the name of the firſt diſcoverer. The latter method, could it have taken place, would have had the advantage of conveying, ſomewhat like a chronological hiſtory of each plant, and at the ſame time perpetuating due credit to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer. Theſe <hi>trivial</hi> names are printed in the margin, to catch the eye inſtantly, which is a great advantage. The invention of trivial names, the hint of which was probably borrowed from <hi>Rivini,</hi> by aſſiſting the memory, has much promoted the knowledge of plants, and muſt be conſidered as a capital improvement. Their uſe in ſpeaking of plants, and forming compendious catalogues, has been acknowledged by every botaniſt ſince the introduction of them.</p>
            <p>In the preface the author gives an ample ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the aſſiſtances he received, and of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0168400500:57"/>
pains he had taken, to bring this work to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate. To this end, he ſpecifies, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries he had travelled over; the many botanic gardens he had viſited; the various excellent <hi>her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baria</hi> that he had examined, in <hi>Sweden, Holland, England,</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> the names of his pupils educated under him, and their various peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; from all which he reaped great advantages, as from theſe he received various new plants: and, finally, he acknowledges the many liberal communications of ſeeds and ſpecimens, ſent to him from all parts of the world by the firſt bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts of the time.</p>
            <p>As this work contains all the plants of the known world which had come to <hi>Linnaeus</hi>'s knowledge, or rather inſpection; which, at the publication of theſe volumes, appear to have amounted to about 7,300 ſpecies, all varieties excluded, the profeſſed botaniſt has only to regret, that it could not have been extended by the author himſelf, to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>pinax,</hi> and <hi>hiſtory</hi> of every plant therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p>In this year alſo LINNAEUS publiſhed MUSEUM TESSINIANUM, <hi>opera Ill. Comitis C. G.</hi> TESSIN, <hi>Regis Regnique Senatoris, &amp;c. &amp;c. collectum.</hi> Holm. 1753, fol. pp. 90. tab. 12. This is a deſcription of the cabinet of LINNAEUS'S firſt patron and great friend <hi>Count Teſſin,</hi> at that time preceptor to the Prince Royal, now King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who had ſpared no expence in collecting a rich muſeum, principally conſiſting of ſubjects in mineralogy, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly abounding in foſſils of the figured or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous kind. The work is in <hi>Swediſh</hi> and <hi>Latin;</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0168400500:58"/>
and the tables repreſent ſeveral ſcarce and very valuable <hi>figured foſſils,</hi> not to be ſeen elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The petrifactions or figured foſſils in this work, are arranged in four orders, founded on the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent modes of the formation of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Foſſilia,</hi> commonly ſo called; ſhells, corals, animal remains, unchanged, except by being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived more or leſs of the connecting animal gluten.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Redintegrata.</hi> Earthy, ſtony, or chryſtalline foſſils, formed within any cruſtaceous or teſtaceous body, as in a mould; thus retaining the caſt, without the external coat.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Impreſſa.</hi> Impreſſions only: as of fiſhes and capillary plants, or ferns, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Tranſubſtantiata.</hi> Perfect petrifactions, in which the original organic parts are perfectly filled up with ſtony particles, and retaining the exact ſtructure, externally and internally, of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal body.</p>
            <p>In 1754 was publiſhed MUSEUM REGIS ADOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHI <hi>Suecorum, &amp;c. in quo Animalia rariora, imprimis et exotica Quadrupedia, Aves, Amphibia, Piſces, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecta, Vermes deſcribuntur et determinantur, Latine et Suetice.</hi> Fol. 1754, pp. 135. tab. 33. This ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did volume is frequently referred to by our author in his <hi>Syſtema,</hi> on account of the figures of ſo many of the rarer ſerpents, and fiſhes, here engraven. Of the former there are 48 ſpecies, and of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 32; ſpecimens of which are all preſerved in ſpirits in the royal muſeum; in the palace of <hi>Ulrickſdahl.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fame which our author had now acquired
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0168400500:59"/>
by his <hi>Syſtema Naturae,</hi> of which a ſixth edition, much enlarged, had been publiſhed at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> in 1748, in 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, pp. 232, with eight tables, expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory of the claſſes and orders; and which was alſo republiſhed by <hi>Gronovius</hi> at <hi>Leyden;</hi> had brought, as it were, a conflux of every thing rare and valuable in every branch of nature, from all parts of the globe, into <hi>Sweden.</hi> The king and queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> had their ſeparate collections of rarities; the former at <hi>Ulrickſdahl,</hi> as hath juſt been mentioned; the latter, very rich in exotic inſects and ſhells, procured at a great expence, at the palace of <hi>Drottningholm.</hi> Theſe our author was employed in arranging and deſcribing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, the <hi>muſeum</hi> of the royal academy of <hi>Upſal</hi> had been augmented by a conſiderable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the king, whilſt hereditary prince, in 1746; by another, from Count <hi>Gyllenborg,</hi> the year before; by a third, from <hi>M. Grill,</hi> an opulent citizen of <hi>Stockholm.</hi> The contents of theſe three collections are given in the firſt volume of the <hi>Amoenitates Academicae.</hi> We mention them here only to ſhew that LINNAEUS now began to enjoy ample reſources in every branch of natural hiſtory at home; beſides that many ingenious men, who had been educated under him, were now diſperſed into various quarters of the globe; and that from their letters he received great intelligence and ſatisfaction. Seeds and ſpecimens of plants were ſent him from <hi>Siberia,</hi> by <hi>Gmelin;</hi> from <hi>America,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> and Governor <hi>Coldingham;</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> by Mr. COLLINSON; Mr. <hi>Ellis;</hi> as alſo from his friends in <hi>Holland,</hi> and various other parts
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0168400500:60"/>
of <hi>Europe.</hi> And thus it will be ſeen, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſcarcely to feel the diſadvantages of his northern ſituation.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now alſo begin to ſee the profeſſor in a more elevated rank and ſituation in life. His reputation had already procured him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours from almoſt all the Royal Societies in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> Into the <hi>Imperial Academy,</hi> he had been very early received, and diſtinguiſhed, according to the cuſtom of that inſtitution, with a claſſic name, having moſt aptly been called DIOSCORIDES <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:</hi> and in the year 1753 he received this honour from the Royal Society of <hi>London;</hi> and his own ſovereign, truly ſenſible of his merit, and greatly eſteeming his character and abilities, favoured him with a mark of his diſtinction and regard, by creating him a KNIGHT of the POLAR STAR. It was now no longer <hi>Laudatur et alget.</hi> His emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments kept pace with his fame and honours; his practice in his profeſſion became lucrative, and we find him ſoon after poſſeſſed of his country houſe and gardens at <hi>Hammarby,</hi> about five miles from <hi>Upſal.</hi> He had moreover received one of the moſt flattering teſtimonies of the extent and magnitude of his fame, that perhaps was ever ſhewn to any literary character, the ſtate of the nation which conferred it, with all its circumſtances, duly conſidered. This was an invitation to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> from the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> there to preſide as a naturaliſt, with the offer of an annual penſion for life of 2000 piſtoles, letters of nobility, and the perfect free exerciſe of his own religion. An offer not readily parallelled in the hiſtory of modern
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0168400500:61"/>
times! That he did not accept of it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, having, after the moſt perfect acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſingular honour done him, returned for anſwer, <q rend="margQuotes">that, if he had any merits, they were due to his own country.</q>

            <p>In the year 1755, the Royal Academy of Sciences at <hi>Stockholm</hi> honoured our profeſſor with one of the firſt premiums, agreeably to the will of Count <hi>Sparre;</hi> who had decreed two gold medals, of ten ducats value each, to be annually given by the academy, to the authors of ſuch papers, in the preceding year's <hi>Stockholm</hi> Acts, as ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged moſt uſeful in promoting agriculture par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and all branches of rural oeconomy. This medal bore on one ſide, the arms of the Count, with this motto—<hi>Superſtes in Scientiis amor</hi> FREDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICI SPARRE.—LINNAEUS obtained it in conſequence of a paper <hi>de Plantis, quae Alpium Suecicarum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digenae, magno rei oeconomicae et medicae emolumento fieri poſſint,</hi> and the ultimate intention was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend theſe plants, as adapted to culture in <hi>Lapland.</hi> This paper was inſerted in the <hi>Stockholm</hi> Acts for 1754. Vol. XV.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LINNAEUS alſo obtained the</hi> praemium centum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reorum, <hi>propoſed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences at</hi> Peterſburgh, <hi>for the beſt paper written to</hi> eſtabliſh, <hi>or</hi> diſprove, <hi>by</hi> new <hi>arguments, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the ſexes of plants. On this occaſion the profeſſor wrote his DISQUISITIO</hi> de quaeſtione ab Acad. Imper. Scient. Petrop. in annum <hi>1759</hi> pro praemio propoſita: <hi>SEXUM PLANTARUM</hi> argumentis et experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis novis, praeter adhuc jam cognita, vel corroborare vel impugnare, praemiſſa expoſitione hiſtorica et phyſica
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0168400500:62"/>
omnium Plantae partium, quae aliquid ad faecundationem et perfectionem ſeminis, et fructus conferre credun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; ab eadem Academia die <hi>6</hi> Sept. <hi>1760,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventu publico praemio ornata. Petrop. <hi>1760, 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, pp. 32.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Apart from all foregoing arguments, facts, and experiments, brought in ſupport of this queſtion, the profeſſor has in this little tract ſufficiently proved, by a ſeries of <hi>new</hi> facts, that the duſt of the <hi>Antherae,</hi> analogically called the male parts, is abſolutely neceſſary to be ſhed on the <hi>ſtigma</hi> or female part, in order to render the ſeed fertile. His theory of vegetation, prefixed to this paper, is explained more at large in the <hi>Prolepſis Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> printed in the 6th volume of the <hi>Amoenitates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was, if poſſible, an additional glory to LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS to have merited this premium from the <hi>Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> academy; inaſmuch as a profeſſor of that ſociety, a few years before, had with more than common zeal, although with a futility like that of the other antagoniſts of our author, endeavoured to overturn the whole <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſyſtem of botany, by attempting to ſhew that the doctrine of the ſexes of plants, had no foundation in nature, and was unſupported by facts and experiments.</p>
            <p>The great character of LINNAEUS, and that of his colleagues, particularly of <hi>Roſen,</hi> in the medical departments, and their united endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, had very conſiderably raiſed the credit of the univerſity of <hi>Upſal,</hi> as we have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. It is certain, that the number of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are, at this time, nearly double what they are ſaid to have been in accounts written 30 and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0168400500:63"/>
40 years ago. The emulation excited among the ſtudents amply rewarded thoſe gentlemen for their pains, by the vaſt harveſt of uſeful information flowing in, particularly on the ſubjects of natural hiſtory, from their pupils, now diſperſed in every part of the world. Many of theſe young men, after being properly grounded in the principles of phyſic, had, with an ardour which nothing but the ſtrongeſt love of ſcience could inſpire, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily undertaken the moſt diſtant and perilous voyages, ſupported by the munificence of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular patrons or ſocieties, to gratify their taſte in the purſuits of natural hiſtory, and other uſeful knowledge. Several of theſe young men periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from change of climate, or various other cauſes, and much of the fruit of their labour was loſt with them. Such was the fate of <hi>Ternſtröem,</hi> at <hi>Pulicandor,</hi> in 1745; of <hi>Haſſelquiſt,</hi> who went into <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and died at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in 1752; of <hi>Loefling,</hi> who died in <hi>Cumana,</hi> in 1756. Of the firſt of theſe we have no remains. The papers of <hi>Haſſelquiſt</hi> were redeemed by the queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and publiſhed by LINNAEUS, under the title of ITER PALAESTINUM, in 1757, in 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>; and thoſe of <hi>Loefling,</hi> under the title of ITER HISPANICUM, in 1758; to each of which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed a ſhort account of the author. We have alſo the fruit of <hi>Kalm</hi>'s journey in <hi>N. America,</hi> and of the voyage of <hi>Oſbeck</hi> and <hi>Toren,</hi> who both went chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains to <hi>Swediſh Eaſt India</hi> ſhips. Theſe are here mentioned particularly, as they are all tranſlated, and publiſhed ſince in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> language. We yet deplore the more recent fate of <hi>Forſkal,</hi> and his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0168400500:64"/>
unfortunate aſſociates, in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the more ſo, ſince his poſthumous pieces, publiſhed at <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen</hi> in 1775, are ſufficient to convince us, that the fruit of that expedition would have been rich and large, had it not been ſo unfortunately blaſted.</p>
            <p>There were alſo ſeveral others, who made leſs remote journies for the ſame purpoſe; ſuch were <hi>L. Montin,</hi> who viſited <hi>Lula-Lapmark</hi> in 1749; <hi>M. Koehler,</hi> who travelled into the ſouthern part of <hi>Italy</hi> in 1752; Dr. SOLANDER, who viſited <hi>Pitho-Lapmark,</hi> and <hi>Torno-Lapmark,</hi> in 1753, where he made ſeveral diſcoveries, and brought back divers rare plants, and other ſubjects in natural hiſtory, which had eſcaped the diligence of his great maſter; <hi>D. Rolander,</hi> who viſited <hi>Surinam</hi> and <hi>St. Euſtatia,</hi> in 1755; <hi>A. R. Martin,</hi> who ſearched <hi>Greenland</hi> in 1758, as <hi>C. Alſtroëmer</hi> did the ſouthern parts of <hi>Europe</hi> in 1760. We do not mention others, who re-viſited the iſle of <hi>Gothland</hi> in 1752 and 1760, after <hi>Linnaeus</hi>'s own tour into that place.</p>
            <p>The travels of theſe gentlemen afforded great ſources of information, and furniſhed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for our author, that proved very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the laſt editions of his <hi>Syſtema Naturae,</hi> and <hi>Species Plantarum:</hi> inſomuch, that we ſhall ſee him exemplifying, in a much more perfect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed manner, his <hi>Syſtem of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This work, as far as reſpected the <hi>vegetable</hi> kingdom, had been ſeparately and largely exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, as before mentioned, in the <hi>Genera Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum,</hi> and the <hi>ſpecies</hi> given in the ſeveral <hi>Florae</hi> of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0168400500:65"/>
our author, and finally in the <hi>Species Plantarum.</hi> As yet, however, although it had paſſed through nine editions, little more had appeared in the <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> kingdom than the generical characters, with a ſingle ſpecific name; inſomuch that the ninth edition at <hi>Leyden,</hi> in 1756, was contained in a ſmall octavo of 226 pages. This it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved notwithſtanding, was only a republication of the author's ſixth edition in 1748. The ſcheme therefore cannot be conſidered as perfected by the author, until the publication of the 10th edition, in 1758, the firſt part of which, relating to the animal kingdom, makes a volume of 821 pages; and the ſame part, in the 12th and laſt edition, is augmented by the addition of new ſubjects to 1327 pages. This work therefore, publiſhed in two volumes at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> in 1766 and 1767, is to be conſidered as having received the author's finiſhing hand, as far as poſſible, ſince he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to deſcribe only ſuch <hi>animals</hi> as had fallen under his own inſpection, except in ſome inſtances, where his dependence upon other authority ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it juſtifiable. The title of this enlarged edition runs thus:</p>

But man is not left by LINNAEUS, to contemplate himſelf merely as ſuch; but he is led to the conſideration of what he ought to be, as an <hi>intelligent and moral being,</hi> in a comment on the <hi>Grecian</hi> Sage's dictate, KNOW THYSELF: by the true application of which, he cannot but be ſufficiently elevated above every humiliating idea which can otherwiſe ariſe from ſuch an aſſociation.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>ſpecific</hi> characters in the claſs of <hi>birds</hi> are deduced from a great variety of particulars. In ſeveral, as in the <hi>Falcon</hi> genus, the colour of the <hi>cere,</hi> or naked tunic that ſurrounds the baſis of the <hi>beak,</hi> and the colour of the legs, aſſiſt in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the ſpecies. The <hi>colour</hi> of the bird in general is ſubject to great variation in different countries, as well as in the ſame country at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

ſeaſons in the year, as is more particularly ſeen in the arctic regions; not to mention that of the ſexes in almoſt all kinds. Our author therefore does not truſt to this, wherever a more permanent mark can be found. It muſt, however, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that in too many inſtances, it is neceſſary to truſt entirely to this diſtinction, howſoever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable. The form of the <hi>tail,</hi> as it happens to be <hi>even, cuneated,</hi> or <hi>forked,</hi> is an excellent and firm note; in the <hi>Parrot</hi> genus its length, as <hi>ſhorter</hi> or <hi>longer</hi> than the body, is of great ſervice. In others, the <hi>colour</hi> of the <hi>beak,</hi> a <hi>naked</hi> or <hi>creſted head,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to form the note of diſtinction. And in fine, nature has ſtamped upon others ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, which points them out immediately; as, the <hi>receptacle</hi> of the lower mandible, in the <hi>Pelican;</hi> two long <hi>tail-feathers,</hi> in the <hi>Tropic-bird;</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the mandibles in the <hi>Croſs-beak,</hi> &amp;c. Among the common marks, none more frequently occur than the differences of colour in the <hi>quill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>tail.</hi> This claſs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends upwards of 930 ſubjects.</p>

                        <p>This part of the Syſtem contains upwards of 290 ſubjects.</p>
                        <p>In the REPTILES order, the ſpecific characters of the <hi>Teſtudo</hi> genus are deduced principally from the difference in the <hi>ſhells,</hi> and the <hi>feet;</hi> which in the <hi>Turtles</hi> are pinniform, and in the <hi>Tortoiſes</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated. In the <hi>Lacerta</hi> genus, from the <hi>tail, head, toes,</hi> and various other parts; and in the <hi>Rana,</hi> from the diverſity in the <hi>make of the body,</hi> and number of the <hi>claws</hi> on the fore or hinder feet.</p>
                        <p>In the SERPENTES order, the ſpecific diſtinctions have ever been matter of great difficulty with naturaliſts, as they were commonly taken from the <hi>colour,</hi> which is ſubject to an almoſt infinite variation. Hence it has happened that <hi>Seba,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the <hi>colours</hi> alone, hath, in the opinion of our author, figured the <hi>Boa Conſtrictor,</hi> or Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic Serpent, ten times, as ſo many diſtinct ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and the <hi>Coluber Naga,</hi> or Hooded Viper, fourteen, LINNAEUS at length diſcovered a much

more certain and permanent note, upon which his <hi>ſpecific</hi> characters are ſolely founded: it was firſt exemplified in the <hi>Amphibia Gyllenborgiana,</hi> and he has ſince retained it in all his works, ſenſible however that it is yet liable to failure: this ariſes from the number of the ſmall <hi>ſhields</hi> and <hi>ſcales,</hi> or <hi>rings</hi> and <hi>rugae</hi> of the belly and tail; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion thoſe numbers bear to each other in the different ſpecies: for example, in our <hi>Common Viper</hi> the <hi>ſhields</hi> of the <hi>belly</hi> are uſually about 146, and the <hi>ſcales</hi> of the <hi>tail,</hi> that is all below the anus, about 39 or 40: the <hi>ſhields</hi> in our <hi>Common Snake</hi> about 170, and the <hi>ſcales</hi> about 60.</p>
                        <p>In the NANTES the ſpecific characters are ſhort, but very various in the different <hi>genera,</hi> as to the parts of the animal from which they are deduced: in the <hi>Petromyzon</hi> and <hi>Raia,</hi> from the <hi>mouth, fins, teeth,</hi> &amp;c.; in the latter very much from the <hi>body</hi> itſelf: in the <hi>Squalus,</hi> from a variety of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: in the <hi>Acipenſer,</hi> from the <hi>cirri</hi> or beard, and the <hi>dorſal ſhields,</hi> or <hi>ſquamae:</hi> in the <hi>Baliſtes,</hi> from the fins and tail: in the <hi>Oſtracion,</hi> from the different <hi>angulated form</hi> of the <hi>body:</hi> in the <hi>Tetrodon,</hi> from differences in the body chiefly; and in the remaining <hi>genera,</hi> from the form of the body, and the differences in the fins.</p>

                  <p>No part of the ſyſtem of nature has undergone a greater change than this claſs; neither does our author ſtand more unrivalled, than in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent arrangement he has given to this branch of natural hiſtory; which, before his time, was nearly without method. It comprehends 87 GENERA, diſpoſed into ſeven <hi>orders,</hi> founded, in moſt of them, on the differences obſervable in the <hi>number</hi> and <hi>texture</hi> of the <hi>wings.</hi> Our intended brevity will not permit a detail of the <hi>genera,</hi> in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding parts of the ſyſtem; we muſt, therefore, now that we are deſcended to the inferior parts of the animal kingdom, only give the definitions of the ſeveral <hi>orders,</hi> with a few obſervations. The firſt order is called,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. COLEOPTERA. Inſects having the wings co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with two cruſtaceous caſes, divided by a longitudinal ſuture.</p>
                  <p>This order is the moſt numerous; it contains almoſt all thoſe inſects which go under the general name of <hi>Beetles:</hi> and includes upwards of 900 ſpecies, ranked under 30 genera.

a ſtraight ſuture, but incumbent on each other in the margin. The beak curved inwards.</p>
                  <p>This order contains about 350 ſpecies, under 12 <hi>genera;</hi> among theſe are the Cock-roach, Camel-cricket, Locuſts and Common Crickets, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn-fly, Flea-locuſt, Boat-fly, &amp;c.

                  <p n="3">III. LEPIDOPTERA. Inſects with four wings, imbricated or cloathed with fine ſcales or feathers: tongue ſpiral, and coiled up; body hairy.</p>
                  <p>This order contains only three <hi>genera;</hi> but the ſpecies are very numerous, nearly 800. The But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflies, Hawk-moths, and the Moths or <hi>Phalenae.</hi> Of the latter, LINNAEUS enumerates 460 ſpecies. This being the moſt beautiful tribe of inſects, has been much ſought after, and later entomologiſts have conſiderably increaſed this number.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. NEUROPTERA. Inſects with 4 naked, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, or reticulated wings; tail in moſt kinds without a ſting.</p>
                  <p>Upwards of 80 ſpecies in 7 <hi>genera;</hi> among theſe are the Dragon-fly, May-fly, Spring-fly, Pearl-fly, Scorpion-fly, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p n="7">VII. APTERA. Inſects without wings, in either ſex.</p>
                  <p>This order contains 290 ſpecies under 14 <hi>genera,</hi> and falls eaſily into three diviſions.</p>

                  <p>The ſixth and laſt claſs contains the VERMES, which are divided into five orders. LINNAEUS very early adopted the new ſyſtem of <hi>Peyſonnel, Juſſieu,</hi> and ſome others, in introducing the corals and corallines into the animal kingdom, under the names of LITHOPHYTA and ZOOPHYTA. This ſyſtem has had great light thrown upon it by the late excellent Mr. ELLIS, in his hiſtory of Coral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and ſeveral papers printed in the Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tranſactions.</p>
                  <p>As this is by far the moſt anomalous of all the claſſes, the characters of the orders are very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>

                  <p>This order takes in the whole tribe of ſhells, conſiſting of upwards of 800 ſpecies, under 36 <hi>genera,</hi> and diſpoſed in a method entirely new. The three firſt <hi>genera</hi> are the <hi>multivalves,</hi> the next fourteen <hi>bivalves,</hi> and the remainder <hi>univalves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. LITHOPHYTA. Compoſite animals, affixed to, and fabricating a fixed calcareous baſe, called <hi>Coral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This order contains 59 ſpecies, under four <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra:</hi> the <hi>Tubipora,</hi> red tubular Coral; <hi>Madrepores</hi> or Brain Stones; <hi>Millepores;</hi> and another called <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. ZOOPHYTA. Animal compoſite, reſembling a flower, and ſpringing from a vegetating ſtem.</p>
                  <p>This order contains 14 genera, of which nine are fixed, and the other locomotive: amongſt the former rank the <hi>Iſis</hi> or red Coral, Sea Fan, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyonium,</hi> Sponge, Corallines, &amp;c.: among the latter, the Polype, Sea Pens, <hi>Taenia, Furia,</hi> and laſtly the aſſemblage of chaotic, or microſcopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Animalcula.</hi> The ſpecies under this order are 156.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>generical</hi> diſtinctions among the INTESTINA ariſe from the diverſity of the body of the animal, almoſt ſolely.</p>
                  <p>In the MOLLUSCA, from the body and feelers, called <hi>tentacula,</hi> and from other parts.</p>
                  <p>In the TESTACEA, the included animal, the general differences between the ſhells themſelves, but principally the <hi>cardo</hi> or hinge in the bivalves,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0168400500:111"/>
and the <hi>aperture</hi> in the univalves, furniſh the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neric note.</p>
                  <p>In the LITHOPHYTA, the inhabitant animal, and the form of the coral itſelf: and in the ZOOPHYTA, the animal, and the very different forms of the fabrifications, lay a foundation for the generic notes.</p>
                  <p>After having thus exhibited a view of the <hi>Claſſes,</hi> it remains that we give a general account of the method purſued in treating on each ſpecies. To this end it muſt be obſerved, that throughout the whole <hi>ſyſtem,</hi> the <hi>claſſical</hi> character, that of the <hi>order,</hi> and the <hi>generical</hi> note, always make a part in the deſcription of each <hi>ſpecies.</hi> After theſe, our author begins with his own <hi>ſpecific</hi> name for the animal, eſtabliſhed upon the moſt eſſential difference obſervable between that and every other ſpecies of the <hi>genus;</hi> and here it muſt be allowed, that he has, in general, happily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, by giving, in the ſpace of two or three lines, a diſtinction that more immediately points out the animal ſought for, than the long and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured deſcriptions of many foregoing authors. If the <hi>ſpecific</hi> name is the ſame that is adopted in any of his former writings, he refers to it. He has, however, in many parts of this enlarged edition, formed new names to animals noticed in the former edition, and in the <hi>Fauna Suecica.</hi> Where indeed the eſſential or ſpecific diſtinction is the point in view, this muſt frequently be the caſe, ſo long as new ſpecies continue to come in; for, as the eſſential character of each <hi>ſpecies</hi> reſults
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0168400500:112"/>
from the moſt careful compariſon of the whole <hi>genus,</hi> the introduction of a new one muſt, in many inſtances, ſo claſh with the old, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, perhaps, a total alteration in every <hi>ſpecific</hi> name of the <hi>genus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After his own ſpecific name, he gives the <hi>ſynonyms,</hi> and page of the moſt reputed and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic writers in each claſs; and particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to thoſe who have beſt figured his ſubject; then the <hi>locus natalis,</hi> and in many inſtances, more eſpecially among the <hi>Mammalia</hi> and <hi>Aves,</hi> a ſhort but comprehenſive hiſtory reſpecting the nature, economy, and uſes of the animal. To every animal the author has affixed his <hi>trivial</hi> name, expreſſive, moſt commonly, of place where it is found, of its colour, form, or ſome quality or attribute, deſcriptive, as far as may be, of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; or, in a great variety of caſes, where the ſubject has been well known by a ſingle term, he retains that as his <hi>trivial</hi> name. To inſtance in the Partridge and Quail, which both belong to his <hi>genus</hi> eſtabliſhed under the name <hi>Tetrao:</hi> he therefore calls the former <hi>Tetrao Perdix,</hi> and the latter <hi>Tetrao Coturnix.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has been objected to LINNAEUS'S claſſification in various parts of his ſyſtem, that he has thrown together ſubjects too different in their general appearance and economy, by keeping too cloſely to <hi>one</hi> character; to inſtance particularly in the MAMMALIA, by confining himſelf to the teeth. To this it may be anſwered, in general, that if <hi>only</hi> quadrupeds were to be claſſed, no ſyſtem
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0168400500:113"/>
needed to have bee built, as their number is ſo ſmall: but when it is recollected, that <hi>all Nature</hi> was under his eye, and that therefore the ſubjects were almoſt infinite, it became neceſſary to form the baſis of every great diviſion or claſs, <hi>as far as poſſible, on one ſimple foundation.</hi> And perhaps it is the obſervance of this rule that has given LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS'S ſyſtem ſo greatly the advantage over all foregoing writers. For, as nature does not ſeem to have obſerved <hi>any</hi> ſyſtem, ours muſt be artificial, and will ever have its anomalies. As an artificial ſyſtem therefore, that muſt have the preference, which will moſt readily lead to the ſubject under inveſtigation; in which caſe it is of ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance where it is placed, and how far removed from others with which it ſeems to bear a ſimilar and general appearance.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall cloſe this brief view of the arrangement of animals, by exhibiting the number of ſubjects enumerated, all of which are ſynonymed by the author, in the 12th edition of his <hi>Syſtem.</hi>

This was drawn up, and publiſhed, by order of the queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who had conſtructed a copious and rich cabinet of natural hiſtory, at the palace of <hi>Drottningholm;</hi> the ſubjects of which, as hath been obſerved, LINNAEUS had been appointed to arrange. The great expence her majeſty had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in procuring, particularly inſects and fhells, had given this collection an advantage that proved very favourable to our author, by throwing in his way a multitude of fine and very expenſive objects, which otherwiſe, probably, he could have had no opportunity of deſcribing; and theſe were, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, all collected before the publication of the enlarged editions of the <hi>Syſtem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this work the <hi>exotic</hi> inſects and ſhells only are introduced; of the former, 436; and of the latter, 434, with twenty-five of the <hi>Molluſca.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects chiefly conſiſt of the large and beautiful <hi>Lepidoptera;</hi> and the ſhells abound with all their elegant varieties. Theſe are deſcribed at large, with all that preciſion, brevity, and accurate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the ſeveral parts, which every where manifeſts itſelf ſo happily in our author's writings. Both in <hi>entomology</hi> and <hi>conchology</hi> a new language is introduced; and theſe deſcriptions may well ſtand as models for future writings.</p>
                  <p>Annexed to this work is the ſecond part, or rather only the <hi>prodromus,</hi> of the MUSEUM ADOLPHI <hi>Frederici</hi> REGIS, <hi>in quo animalia rariora, imprimis et exotica, aves, amphibia, piſces deſcribuntur.</hi> 1764, pp.

110. In this additional volume are deſcribed at large 156 ſubjects of the animal kingdom, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the firſt four claſſes; and all acquired ſince the publication of the firſt part in 1754. Throughout the whole <hi>Syſtem,</hi> LINNAEUS has referred to theſe books for deſcriptions at large to all the exotics: and nothing could be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the critical zoologiſt, than to ſee the plan of this volume perfected through the whole hiſtory of animals.</p>

               <head>TOM. II. The VEGETABLE KINGDOM.</head>
               <p>The ſecond part of the <hi>Syſtema Naturae,</hi> relating to vegetables, in all the editions prior to the tenth, was very compendiouſly exhibited; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor having, after his <hi>Clavis Claſſium,</hi> only given the names of the <hi>genera,</hi> with their <hi>eſſential</hi> or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviated characters, without touching at all on ſpecific diſtinctions, which were reſerved for the preſent enlarged edition of the Syſtem, and for the SPECIES PLANTARUM, a work before ſpoken of. This volume contains upwards of 560 pages; and in the twelfth edition of 1767, by the acceſſion of new materials, is enlarged to 731. It contains, in a moſt compendious manner, a view of the whole vegetable kingdom, as far as the ſubjects thereof had come under our author's own inſpection, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed according to that ſyſtem of which LINNAEUS had been the inventor, founded, as to the claſſical part, upon the <hi>ſexes</hi> of plants; a ſyſtem now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſally received. It is in this branch
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0168400500:116"/>
of the ſtudy of nature, that this great naturaliſt has ſo diſtinguiſhed himſelf. From him <hi>botany</hi> boaſts a new <hi>aera;</hi> and HALLER, one of the firſt writers of this age, in the ſame line of ſcience, and who alone might dare to rival him, has, with a liberality of mind becoming a great man, allowed this ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority to LINNAEUS.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed to a particular account of this part of the ſyſtem, it may not be improper to premiſe ſome obſervations on <hi>methods</hi> of <hi>botany</hi> in general, before our author wrote. It is needleſs to urge the neceſſity of <hi>method</hi> in the ſtudy of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it is the very ſoul of ſcience; and, amidſt ſuch a multitude of objects which the vegetable kingdom affords, all attempts towards the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of knowledge without it, muſt end in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and confuſion. We have ſufficient proofs of this in the writers upon plants before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſyſtems, and ſee and deplore the want of them, in the loſs of many valuable articles, not only in the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> but in the <hi>Materia Pictoria,</hi> and <hi>Tinctoria</hi> of the antients. Articles, the virtues and properties of which appear to have been well aſcertained, are now loſt to us, for want of a more ſcientific arrangement of the ſubjects, and accuracy in the deſcriptions of them.</p>
               <p>Botanic writers choſe very different methods of arranging plants, not only before, but ſince, the invention of ſyſtematic botany. The <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabetic</hi> has been much followed, eſpecially in local catalogues. Some have diſpoſed the plants according to <hi>the time of flowering;</hi> as <hi>Pauli,</hi> in his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0168400500:117"/>
                  <hi>Quadripartitum Botanicum,</hi> publiſhed in 1639; <hi>Beſter,</hi> in the <hi>Hortus Eyſtettenſis,</hi> 1640; and <hi>Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenius,</hi> in the <hi>Catalogus Giſſenſis,</hi> 1719. Others have arranged them according to the <hi>different places of their growth;</hi> as the authors of the <hi>Hiſtoria Lugdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis,</hi> in 1587: and ſome according to their <hi>virtues in medicine.</hi> Others again, obſerving that numbers of vegetables agreed with each other in their general habit and appearance, or had a certain harmony and proportion in the form and diſpoſition of their roots, leaves, flowers, or fruit; in their particular mode of growing, flowering, or foliation, ſaw that they naturally fell as it were into claſſes, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch diſtinctions. Hence their diviſion of trees, into <hi>pomiferae, pruniferae, bacciferae, nuciferae, glandiferae,</hi> &amp;c.; of herbs, into <hi>bulboſae, ſiliquoſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbelliferae, verticillatae, papilionaceae,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe were ſo many <hi>claſſes</hi> or <hi>orders,</hi> which nature had ſo characterized that they could not eſcape their notice; and, could all the ſubjects of the vegetable kingdom be <hi>properly reduced</hi> to ſuch combinations, and the whole chain <hi>properly connected,</hi> we ſhould then ſee what is meant by the NATURAL METHOD, that <hi>ultimum et deſideratum</hi> of botany, of which our author ſays, however, <q rend="margQuotes">Nec ſperare fas eſt, quod noſtra Aetas ſyſtema quoddam naturale videre queat, et vix ſeri nepotes.</q> Nevertheleſs the beſt writers of the laſt century, ſuch were <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Caſpar Bauhine,</hi> endeavoured to preſerve the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned arrangement, although it was in a rude manner. In this they were followed by our own countrymen <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Parkinſon,</hi> but as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0168400500:118"/>
they eſtabliſhed no preciſe definitions to their claſſes, ſo in their ſubdiviſions, or chapters, they paid little or no regard to the minuter parts of diſtinction, taken from the fructification; hence, nothing like <hi>generical notes</hi> can be diſcovered in their methods: ſo that the only reſource, in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of their plants, was, to read over their long and tedious deſcriptions, which, after all, were frequently inſufficient to diſtinguiſh the plant ſought for.</p>
               <p>That great naturaliſt <hi>Conrade</hi> GESNER, who died in 1565, in his 50th year, appears to have been the firſt who thought, with any preciſion, of a method of claſſing plants from the <hi>flower,</hi> or <hi>fruit;</hi> but he only ſlightly touches thereon in his epiſtles; he lived not to bring any thing to perfection in this way. It was reſerved for <hi>Caeſalpinus,</hi> phyſician to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. to be the firſt author who arranged plants in a true ſyſtematic manner, in his <hi>Libri de Plantis,</hi> publiſhed in 1583, in which he eſtabliſhes the characters principally <hi>from the fruit.</hi> It is wonderful, that after his time, though ſo many eminent botaniſts flouriſhed, among whom were the two <hi>Bauhines,</hi> no one ever thought of purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plan he laid down, until <hi>Moriſon</hi> and <hi>Ray,</hi> who both publiſhed, nearly together, their ſeparate ſyſtems, founded alſo upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions principally drawn from the fruit. Since their time, others have laboured to bring their ſyſtems to perfection; as <hi>Knaut</hi> in <hi>Germany; Paul Herman,</hi> and <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> and <hi>Dillenius,</hi> late profeſſor at <hi>Oxford,</hi> had ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0168400500:119"/>
perfected Mr. <hi>Ray</hi>'s method, as is evident from the arrangement he has given to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> plants, in the third edition of that author's <hi>Synopſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several elegant ſyſtems have alſo been formed from the <hi>flower,</hi> as the baſis of the <hi>claſſical</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; in conſidering which, both the <hi>regularity</hi> and <hi>irregularity,</hi> as well as the <hi>number</hi> of the <hi>petals,</hi> have been made the principal diſtinction. <hi>Rivini,</hi> at <hi>Leipſic,</hi> in 1690, was the firſt who took the flower as the foundation of his method, as did <hi>Ruppius</hi> in 1718. But no one carried this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to ſuch perfection as <hi>Tournefort,</hi> in 1694, who forms his <hi>claſſical</hi> character from the <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>flower,</hi> and eſtabliſhes his <hi>orders</hi> or ſubdiviſions on the different <hi>ſituation</hi> of <hi>the fruit,</hi> whether above or below the <hi>empalement</hi> or <hi>receptacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe methods, in which the authors have conſidered one part only, either <hi>flower</hi> or <hi>fruit,</hi> as the baſe of their ſyſtems, ſeveral others have been conſtructed of late years, in which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables have been arranged, as far as poſſible, according to what have been called the <hi>natural claſſes;</hi> the foundations of which take in a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſet of characters, ariſing from a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and agreement in the <hi>habit</hi> of the plants, as well as their <hi>harmony</hi> in the eſſential <hi>parts of fructification.</hi> Among theſe, that of <hi>Van Royen,</hi> late profeſſor at <hi>Leyden,</hi> is among the moſt elegant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts towards this <hi>ultimum</hi> in botany. This is exhibited in the <hi>Prodromus Florae Leydenſis,</hi> 1740. He is followed by <hi>Gmelin,</hi> in the <hi>Flora Sibirica,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0168400500:120"/>
1747, &amp;c. Theſe authors, as alſo <hi>L. Gerard,</hi> in his <hi>Flora Gallo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>provincialis,</hi> Paris 1761, preſerve the <hi>natural generical characters</hi> of LINNAEUS almoſt entire through their ſyſtems; and the latter writer has, with ſome variations, taken the <hi>orders</hi> of a <hi>natural method,</hi> conſtructed by <hi>B. Juſſieu,</hi> for his <hi>claſſes.</hi> HALLER alſo planned, and brought to great perfection, a method of this kind, as is exhibited in his <hi>Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae,</hi> 1742, and in the <hi>Hortus Gottingenſis,</hi> 1753, which he has ſince ſtill more elaborated, in a work of infinite labour and merit, the <hi>Hiſtoria Stirpium Helvetiae,</hi> 3 tom. fol. 1768.</p>
               <p>LINNAEUS himſelf very early attempted a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> method; but it is evident he thought there were too many links wanting in the chain, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it the readieſt guide to botanical ſcience; ſince he ſoon deſerted it, although he continued to improve it to the laſt: however he only reduced the <hi>genera</hi> into <hi>orders,</hi> but did not venture ſo far as to form the <hi>claſſical</hi> part of a ſyſtem on that plan. The preſent learned and indefatigable profeſſor Dr. HOPE, at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> whoſe zeal and ſucceſs in cultivating and diffuſing the principles of the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſyſtem are well known, has conſtructed perhaps the moſt elaborate attempt of this kind that the botaniſts have ever ſeen. We join with many others in wiſhing that he may be enabled to give it all that perfection which may encourage him to preſent it to the public.</p>
               <p>Methods have alſo been formed from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies and arrangement of the <hi>calyx,</hi> or cup
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0168400500:121"/>
of the flower in plants. Profeſſor <hi>Magnol,</hi> of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> publiſhed in 1720 on this plan; and LINNAEUS himſelf in 1737, but he did not purſue it.</p>
               <p>Every method of arrangement hath its advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in ſome reſpect or other; and it is ſurely rather to be regretted, howſoever the <hi>flower</hi> may claim the preference, that a method founded in the diſtinctions of the <hi>fruit,</hi> ſhould not alſo have as it were a ſecondary place in common uſe; for, as all artificial methods are only ſuppoſed to be ſo many <hi>ſuccedanea</hi> to the <hi>natural</hi> one, a due attention to each might tend to illuſtrate the natural claſſes, to connect them, and reduce the anomalies, and ſo far pave the way to the accompliſhment of that ſcheme, which, however, will yet by many be conſidered as quite impracticable in botany.</p>
               <p>LINNAEUS was the firſt who conſtituted the <hi>ſtamina</hi> and <hi>piſtils</hi> as the baſis of an artificial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of arranging plants; and he tells us, in his CLASSES PLANTARUM, he was led to this by conſidering the great importance of theſe parts in vegetation. They alone are the eſſentials neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to fructification; all other parts, except the <hi>anthera</hi> and <hi>ſtigma,</hi> being wanting in ſome flowers; and the preſent philoſophy of botany regards the former as the <hi>male,</hi> and the latter as the <hi>female</hi> organs of generation in plants. As ſuch indeed they muſt be conſidered <hi>analogically,</hi> and in a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical view; yet, perhaps, the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſyſtem, admirable as it is, would not have been leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable had the claſſical terms been expreſſive

only of <hi>number</hi> and <hi>ſituation,</hi> without regard to the offices of the parts in framing the terms. <hi>Ludwig,</hi> of <hi>Leipſic,</hi> who has endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine the ſyſtems of <hi>Rivinus</hi> and LINNAEUS, by taking his <hi>claſſes</hi> from the method of the former, and his <hi>orders</hi> from that of the latter, has avoided this mode of expreſſion, in ſubſtituting the terms <hi>monantherae, monoſtylae,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The author begins the new and enlarged edition of the <hi>Syſtema Vegetabilium</hi> of 1767, by premiſing a compendious view of the philoſophy of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and then proceeds to what he calls <hi>Delineatio Plantae,</hi> ſomething analogous to what he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, in the editions prior to the 10th, <hi>Methodus Demonſtrandi Vegetabilia.</hi> Here he introduces all the terms he makes uſe of in deſcribing plants, and, by a methodical and apt diſpoſition of them, really explains them at the ſame time. After this, he gives the <hi>Clavis et Characteres Claſſium,</hi> and then comes to the ſyſtem itſelf.</p>
               <p>The prerogative of any artificial ſyſtem in botany, <hi>is ſuppoſed</hi> to conſiſt in its keeping toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as much as poſſible, the <hi>genera,</hi> in what are called the <hi>natural claſſes</hi> or orders, and thus ſo far approaching to the ſyſtem of nature. All <hi>artificial</hi> ſyſtems being founded on <hi>ſome,</hi> or <hi>other,</hi> or <hi>all</hi> the parts of <hi>fructification,</hi> without regard to <hi>habit,</hi> will be found in many inſtances to break the order of the <hi>natural</hi> claſſes, and disjoin <hi>genera,</hi> which nature ſeems to have claſſed. The more ſimple and uniform the claſſical characters of any ſyſtem are, the more they are likely to interfere in this reſpect; nevertheleſs, it is pleaſing to obſerve, how
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0168400500:123"/>
well many of the <hi>natural</hi> claſſes are kept together in the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſyſtem; the characters of which enjoy the advantage of being very ſimple, and eaſy to retain in the memory, and of being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the parts of plants as little ſubject to vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as any whatever: yet, like all other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, it has its defects; of which no one was more ſenſible than the author himſelf. There are many inſtances of particular ſpecies that break through the <hi>generical</hi> and claſſical characters of the ſyſtem itſelf: but for theſe defects there is no other remedy, at preſent, than that which our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has applied, in the volume under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which ought ever, in arrangements of this kind, to be rigidly obſerved. Wherever theſe <hi>anomalies</hi> take place, they are mentioned among the <hi>fictitious</hi> characters, under the claſs and order to which the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>ſtamina</hi> or <hi>piſtils</hi> entitle them to a place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſexual</hi> ſyſtem briefly is as follows:—All known plants are divided into 24 CLASSES; the characters of which are eſtabliſhed upon the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> or different ſituation, or arrangement of the <hi>ſtamina</hi> or male organs; and the ORDERS, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſions, of theſe claſſes, as far as poſſible, on a ſimilar number, ſituation, or arrangement, of the <hi>piſtils,</hi> or female organs.</p>
               <p>The firſt twenty claſſes contain what the author calls <hi>hermaphrodite</hi> flowers, or ſuch as have the <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi> and <hi>piſtils</hi> both within the ſame <hi>cup</hi> or <hi>petals,</hi> or ſtanding on the ſame <hi>receptacle,</hi> where thoſe are wanting. Of theſe twenty, the firſt <hi>ten</hi> claſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in an uninterrupted ſeries, from MONAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRIA
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0168400500:124"/>
to DECANDRIA; the plants of each having as many ſtamina as the title expreſſes.</p>
               <p>The 11th claſs is DODECANDRIA, as there are no plants yet diſcovered which have only eleven ſtamina.</p>
               <p>The 12th, ICOSANDRIA; ſuch plants as have about 20 ſtamina, or more; but always ariſing from the <hi>calyx</hi> or <hi>corolla,</hi> and not from the <hi>recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 13th, POLYANDRIA; ſuch as have from twenty to even a thouſand ſtamina; but always ariſing from the <hi>receptacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 14th claſs, DIDYNAMIA; ſuch as have <hi>four</hi> ſtamina, two long and two ſhort. The eſſential character of this claſs does not conſiſt in the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of ſtamina, otherwiſe the plants might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the <hi>tetrandria</hi> claſs; but, in having two of the ſtamina ſhorter than the other, one piſtil only, and an irregularly-ſhaped corolla.</p>
               <p>The 15th, TETRADYNAMIA; plants with <hi>ſix</hi> ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina, four long and two ſhort.</p>
               <p>The 16th, MONADELPHIA; ſuch as have the ſtamina not diſtinct at the baſe, but united into one body.</p>
               <p>The 17th, DIADELPHIA; ſuch as have the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina united at the baſe into two bodies.</p>
               <p>The 18th, POLYADELPHIA; ſuch as have the ſtamina united at the baſe into ſeveral bodies.</p>
               <p>The 19th, SYNGENESIA; ſuch as have the <hi>anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae,</hi> but not the filaments, coaleſcing together, ſo as to form a tube or cylinder, through which the piſtil is commonly tranſmitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0168400500:125"/>
The 20th, GYNANDRIA; ſuch as have the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina ſpringing from the piſtil itſelf.</p>
               <p>The 21ſt, MONOECIA; ſuch as have ſeparate male and female flowers on the ſame plant.</p>
               <p>The 22d, DIOECIA; ſuch as have ſeparate male and female flowers on ſeparate plants.</p>
               <p>The 23d, POLYGAMIA; ſuch as have conſtantly, beſides hermaphrodite flowers, others, either male or female, on the ſame plant.</p>
               <p>The 24th, CRYPTOGAMIA; containing thoſe plants the mode and organs of whoſe fructification are not yet ſufficiently aſcertained; heretofore called imperfect plants.</p>
               <p>The ſecondary part of the ſyſtem, the OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS, or ſubdiviſions of the foregoing claſſes, are eſtabliſhed on the <hi>number</hi> of the <hi>piſtils</hi> or female parts, through a conſiderable part of the ſyſtem; but in other parts, from various characters. Thus,</p>
               <p>The arrangement from number is purſued no farther than through the firſt thirteen claſſes: that is, ſo long as the <hi>claſſical</hi> character, uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, depends on the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>ſtamina,</hi> ſo long the <hi>orders</hi> likewiſe depend on the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>piſtils:</hi> but, when <hi>ſituation</hi> or different <hi>arrangement</hi> take place, the <hi>orders</hi> are moſt commonly founded on other diſtinctions, which we ſhall briefly ſpecify.</p>
               <p>The 14th claſs, or <hi>Didynamia,</hi> is divided into GYMNOSPERMIA and ANGIOSPERMIA: the former having four naked ſeeds; the latter having the ſeeds incloſed in a ſeed-veſſel.</p>
               <p>The 15th, <hi>Tetradynamia,</hi> has two orders, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0168400500:126"/>
to the ſize and ſhape of the <hi>pod</hi> or <hi>ſhale;</hi> SI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICULOSA, ſhort; and SILIQUOSA, long.</p>
               <p>The orders in the three next claſſes, <hi>Monadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, Diadelphia,</hi> and <hi>Polyadelphia,</hi> are formed from the NUMBER of the <hi>ſtamina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe of the <hi>Syngeneſia</hi> claſs are ſix: in five of which the plants are POLYGAMIAE, and in the remaining one MONOGAMIAE; and the differences in the orders of the former, ariſe from the different ſtructure or ſex of the <hi>floſcules,</hi> conſtituting the whole flower.</p>
               <p>In the 20th claſs, <hi>Gynandria,</hi> the arrangement of the orders ariſes from the NUMBER of the <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi> as in the 16th, 17th, and 18th claſſes.</p>
               <p>In the 21ſt and 22d claſſes, the <hi>Monoecia</hi> and <hi>Dioecia,</hi> the claſſical characters of the foregoing parts of the ſyſtem are adopted as characters of the <hi>orders,</hi> as far down as to the <hi>Monoecia</hi> claſs it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Thus the firſt order of thoſe claſſes contains MONANDROUS plants, and the laſt GYNANDROUS.</p>
               <p>The 23d, the <hi>Polygamia</hi> claſs, is divided into three orders, as the plants are MONOECIOUS, DIOE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIOUS, or TRIOECIOUS.</p>
               <p>The 24th and laſt claſs, <hi>Cryptogamia,</hi> is divided into four orders, containing the FILICES, MUSCI, ALGAE, and FUNGI.</p>

                  <p>The GENERA are eſtabliſhed upon the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of all the parts of fructification compared together, according to their <hi>number, figure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi> and <hi>ſituation.</hi> Of theſe we have ſpoken before, as they conſtitute a large volume in oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavo, to which we refer.</p>
                  <p>But, beſides theſe NATURAL CHARACTERS, or GENERA at large, our author has invented, for brevity's ſake, two other kinds of characters, which he calls FACTITIOUS and ESSENTIAL. The former ſerve to diſtinguiſh each genus from other <hi>genera</hi> of the ſame <hi>artificial</hi> order only, by enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the moſt remarkable differences: theſe greatly facilitate the labour of a young botaniſt. The ESSENTIAL characters, could they be rendered perfect, are deſigned to diſtinguiſh the <hi>genera</hi> from each other in the <hi>natural</hi> orders; but they are not complete as yet, except in a few inſtances; and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0168400500:133"/>
poſſibly they exiſt but in a ſmall number: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, they are attempted through the whole ſyſtem, to ſave the trouble of turning over the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural characters</hi> at large.</p>
                  <p>As this volume was intended to contain all the plants hitherto known, conſequently the <hi>natural</hi> characters could not be introduced; but the <hi>fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> ones are placed, the former at the head of each <hi>claſs,</hi> and the latter before each <hi>genus.</hi> With each generical name the author refers to the number where it is exhibited at large, in the laſt edition of the <hi>Genera Plantarum</hi> in 1764, and to the page of the <hi>Species Plantarum</hi> of 1762, where the ſpecies are detailed and the <hi>ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonyms</hi> added; as he gives in this volume only the ſpecific name invented by himſelf.</p>
                  <p>In forming the laſt branch of the ſyſtem, the SPECIFIC names, LINNAEUS has done more than all the writers on the ſubject had done before him, and taken the utmoſt pains to fix them upon diſtinctions as permanent and invariable as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. This is indeed the ultimate object of all method; and on this plan he has given new <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific</hi> names to all the plants that have come to his knowledge: names, not taken (as had been cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary before) from that of the diſcoverer, the likeneſs of the plant to other ſpecies, place of growth, time of flowering, its ſize, the colour of the flower, or of the plant, ſmell, taſte, or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in medicine, or any other ſuch vague, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, or mutable circumſtance; but from ſome remarkable difference in the root, trunk,

ſtalk, and particularly the leaf, foliation, ramifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome other abiding diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe <hi>ſpecific</hi> names or deſcriptions, LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS has invented, and, in all his works, after the firſt edition of the <hi>Species Plantarum</hi> in 1753, has applied what he calls TRIVIAL names to each plant, conſiſting of a ſingle adjunct to the generical name, expreſſive, if poſſible, of ſome eſſential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the ſpecies: as for inſtance, <hi>integrifo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, laciniata, erecta, repens, aquatica, montana,</hi> &amp;c.: ſometimes, of the name of the inventor; and where, from the laws of his <hi>Fundamenta Botanica,</hi> he has been obliged to change the generical name of a plant well known before, and eſpecially if it was an <hi>officinal</hi> one, he frequently retains the <hi>old generical</hi> name as his <hi>trivial</hi> epithet. Thus as the Penny-royal, or <hi>Pulegium,</hi> really belongs to the <hi>Mentha</hi> genus, according to his characters, he therefore calls it <hi>Mentha Pulegium.</hi> The Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſh, known by the old name <hi>Armoracia,</hi> as it agrees with the <hi>Cochlearia</hi> genus, he calls <hi>Cochle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aria Armoracia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The VARIETIES of plants, which, for want of fixing true <hi>ſpecific</hi> characters, had almoſt increaſed the number of plants double what LINNAEUS thinks they really are, in this work, as in the SPECIES, are totally excluded. Our author has indeed, in the opinion of many of his contemporary botaniſts, carried this matter too far, in diſallowing the name of ſpecies to many plants that are thought to have ſufficiently permanent diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, the ſpace of time elapſed ſince the publication of the <hi>Genera</hi> and <hi>Species Plantarum,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0168400500:135"/>
with the vaſt quantity of new materials ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from all parts of the world, enabled our author greatly to elaborate this laſt edition, and to amend very many <hi>generical</hi> and <hi>ſpecific</hi> characters; as alſo to make many removes, tending greatly to the advancement and perfection of his work. Among theſe removes, many have taken place, particularly in the <hi>Monoecious, Dioecious,</hi> and <hi>Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> claſſes; which is the leſs to be wondered at, ſince obſervations have confirmed, that there are plants of theſe claſſes which, in their younger ſtate, have produced only male flowers, afterwards both male and female, and at length only female.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Species Plantarum</hi> contains near ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred plants. In this volume, the number is augmented by the addition of new plants, and ſuch as were unknown by our author before, to above ſeven thouſand eight hundred.</p>
                  <p>It is proper to remark, that this ſecond tome of the Syſtem was immediately preceded by MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISSA PLANTARUM <hi>Generum, editionis ſextae, et Specie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum editionis ſecundae.</hi> Holm. 1767, pp. 142. in which are deſcribed, as in the <hi>Genera Plantarum,</hi> the natural characters at large of forty-four <hi>genera,</hi> newly conſtructed.

               <head>TOM. III. The FOSSIL KINGDOM.</head>
               <p>We are now to accompany our author into the <hi>Foſſil</hi> kingdom; in which, though he very early gave a ſpecimen of his method of claſſing, he did not fully exemplify, as in vegetables, until the year 1768, when the third tome of the 12th edition of the <hi>Syſtema</hi> was publiſhed, containing the REGNUM LAPIDEUM. This volume makes 222 pages, and is concluded with a ſhort appendix of ſome unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, or not well deſcribed animals and vegetables; together with a general index of the author's own <hi>generical</hi> names throughout every part of the Syſtem, diſtinguiſhing by a different type the ſubjects of the three kingdoms, the whole amounting to 1820 <hi>genera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In arranging Foſſils, there have been various me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods invented; each of which have had their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and, for different purpoſes, each have their advantage. Some have founded the baſis of their ſyſtem on the <hi>figure, colour, ſtructure,</hi> and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and viſible characters; yet, ſcarcely ever truſting ſolely to theſe, they called in the aid of chemiſtry, ſo far at leaſt, as the mineral acids would aſſiſt them. Others, as the profeſſed che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts and metallurgiſts, have eſtabliſhed their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement chiefly on <hi>chemical principles,</hi> as more immediately leading to the <hi>origin</hi> of foſſil bodies in general; on which it muſt be acknowledged, the beſt baſis for a ſyſtem muſt be built, when we are happy enough to get ſufficient light for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and at preſent, mineralogiſts throughout the world ſeem more intent on this view than ever:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0168400500:137"/>
and probably the due conſideration and extenſion of the volcanic ſyſtem, will open new ſources of information in this way.</p>
               <p>This volume begins with LINNAEUS'S own theory of the origin of foſſil bodies in general, and their ſeveral combinations into thoſe forms in which we meet with them in the body of the earth. The methodical and abbreviated manner in which our author has here given his <hi>philoſophy</hi> of foſſil bodies, renders it incapable of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract. He then proceeds to give a ſynoptical or claſſical view of the ſeveral ſyſtems of arranging thoſe bodies, as they ſtand exhibited in the beſt authors on the ſubject, beginning with <hi>Bromelius,</hi> who publiſhed in 1730, and enumerates <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi> in 1747, <hi>Wolterſdorf</hi> in 1748, <hi>Cartheuſer</hi> in 1755, <hi>Juſti</hi> 1757, <hi>Anomymus [Cronſtedt]</hi> in 1758, and concludes with <hi>Vogel</hi> in 1762. To each of theſe he has ſubjoined ſhort remarks relating to their methods, and theory of foſſil bodies, and concludes this introductory part with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the terms of art uſed in his own work.</p>
               <p>In theſe <hi>termini artis,</hi> our author, with his uſual preciſion, has defined a ſet of terms equally new and curious, which are principally adapted to, and uſed in, the ultimate and moſt difficult part of the Syſtem, the ſpecific characters. They are happily framed to expreſs all differences in the <hi>figures</hi> of foſſil bodies; in their <hi>cruſt,</hi> or outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; their <hi>ſuperficies;</hi> their <hi>component particles,</hi> or <hi>fibres;</hi> in their <hi>texture,</hi> whether plated, fiſſile, &amp;c.; in their <hi>hardneſs;</hi> or in their <hi>colour:</hi> the alterations
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0168400500:138"/>
they undergo by <hi>ſolution,</hi> whether by acids, or by fire.</p>
               <p>It has been doubted by ſome of the moſt reſpectable mineralogiſts, whether we ought to deſcend below what are called <hi>generical</hi> diſtinctions in the foſſil kingdom, ſo infinitely do the ſubjects thereof vary, and ſo imperceptible in general is that gradation by which they run into each other, in the various combined forms, in which they are found in the earth. In the mean time, ſome diſtinctions of this kind ſeem quite neceſſary in ſyſtems eſtabliſhed principally on external cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. Thoſe which have for their baſis the <hi>elementary</hi> or <hi>conſtituent principles of bodies,</hi> as ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyzed, may ſtand with propriety in the form of <hi>ſynoptical</hi> tables, as exemplified in <hi>Cronſtedt</hi>'s mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralogy. LINNAEUS and <hi>Wallerius</hi> were among the firſt who attempted the arduous taſk of fixing the <hi>ſpecific</hi> characters: whether future mineralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts will adhere to, and improve this part of the ſcheme, time only muſt ſhew.</p>
               <p>In all ſyſtems of the foſſil kingdom, writers have been more particularly embarraſſed by the <hi>earths</hi> and <hi>ſtones,</hi> eſpecially when thoſe have been more or leſs reduced to the ſtate of <hi>ores,</hi> by the admixture of <hi>metallic</hi> principles. <hi>Salts, inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> and <hi>metals,</hi> generally falling more eaſily, and almoſt naturally, into their ſeveral claſſes, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The chemical ſyſtematics and metallur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts, begin uſually with the <hi>earths,</hi> conſidering them as the baſis of ſtones: LINNAEUS begins with the latter, profeſſing to take a middle way between the mere <hi>metallurgiſt,</hi> and thoſe who
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0168400500:139"/>
characterize from external appearance only. He divides the whole REGNUM LAPIDEUM into three claſſes, under the names of <hi>Petrae, Minerae,</hi> and <hi>Foſſilia,</hi> each being ſubdivided into ſeveral orders, the whole comprehending 54 genera. We muſt only give a general account of his <hi>claſſical</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and thoſe of the <hi>orders;</hi> and enumerate the <hi>genera</hi> under each, with ſome of the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed <hi>ſpecies.</hi>

               <head>GENERA MORBORUM, or CLASSIFICATION of DISEASES.</head>
               <p>WE muſt now look backwards a few years, to conſider our author in another part of his Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorial character. It has been obſerved, that after his eſtabliſhment at <hi>Upſal,</hi> one of his departments, as a profeſſor, was that of teaching the <hi>Diagnoſis Morborum;</hi> and to this end he drew up a ſyſtem,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0168400500:172"/>
in which, as in natural hiſtory, all diſeaſes were diſpoſed into <hi>claſſes, orders,</hi> and <hi>genera,</hi> founded on diſtinctions taken from the <hi>ſymptoms</hi> alone, no regard being had either to remote, or proximate cauſes. Before we proceed to a particular view of LINNAEUS'S method of claſſing diſeaſes, it will be proper to premiſe, that a <hi>noſology</hi> on this plan, the great object of which is to fix <hi>pathognomonics</hi> to every diſeaſe, had been long wiſhed for by ſome writers of the firſt character in the profeſſion: ſuch were <hi>Baglivi, Boerhaave, Gorter, Gaubius,</hi> and <hi>Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> the latter of whom has thus expreſſed himſelf on this ſubject, in the preface to his works: <q rend="margQuotes">Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ut morbi omnes ad definitas ac certas ſpecies revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centur, eadem prorſus diligentia ac <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, qua id factum videmus à botanicis ſcriptoribus in ſuis phytologiis.</q> Yet, amidſt that almoſt infinite variety and complication of appearances which are ſeen in diſeaſes, the difficulty of obtaining ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient diſtinctions, by which the <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies</hi> may be accurately diſcriminated, muſt be allowed to be very great; and poſſibly is in many inſtances unſurmountable. Hence, ſome of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent phyſicians have been led to reject all ſuch arrangements as futile, and impracticable. This, however, hath not deterred others from paying attention to the ſubject, more eſpecially ſome of thoſe, who, from their province as profeſſors, are led to teach the rudiments of the art; and to whom method, <hi>in ſome form,</hi> is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Syſtematic writers had uſed various me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in the diſpoſition of their ſubject. Some
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0168400500:173"/>
had choſen the <hi>alphabetic;</hi> if that deſerves the name of an arrangement: others, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Aretaeus,</hi> and <hi>Caelius Aurelianus,</hi> had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided diſeaſes, from their duration, into <hi>acute,</hi> and <hi>chronical.</hi> Some had preferred the <hi>anatomical</hi> order; which, as it preſuppoſes a knowledge of the ſeat of the diſeaſe, muſt, not unfrequently, prove fallacious: <hi>Sennertus</hi>'s is an inſtance of this kind. However, the <hi>äitiological</hi> arrangement has been moſt followed by the beſt writers among the moderns; ſuch as <hi>Hoffmann,</hi> and <hi>Boerhaave;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps not much leſs fallacious than the anatomical, ſince it is in many inſtances founded on an hypotheſis of the writer: and though <hi>Felix Platerus,</hi> in his <hi>Praxis Medica,</hi> publiſhed in 1602, had given an imperfect ſketch of a noſology on the <hi>ſymptomatic</hi> plan, yet no writer ventured to purſue his idea, for more than a century after his time; diſcouraged as it ſhould ſeem by the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the attempt. At length the late profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor M. SAUVAGES of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> after communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his ſcheme to <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> publiſhed in 1731, in 12<hi rend="sup">mo</hi>. the outlines of ſuch a work, under the title of <hi>Nouvelles Claſſes des Maladies,</hi> in which he profeſſes to define diſeaſes, from <hi>their conſtant and evident ſymptoms only.</hi> In the year 1763, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor augmented his work, by the addition of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> under each <hi>genus,</hi> into 5 volumes in 8<hi rend="sup">vo</hi>. <hi>Sauvages</hi> may be conſidered as having ſpent his life in giving to this deſign a certain degree of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having enlarged it into 2 quarto volumes, in which form it was publiſhed after his death in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0168400500:174"/>
1768: A work, it is to be preſumed, now in the hands of moſt phyſicians.</p>
               <p>It will eaſily be imagined, that an arrangement of this kind was too congenial to LINNAEUS to be neglected by him. In fact, it appears that he very early correſponded with <hi>Sauvages</hi> on this ſubject, that he ſoon adopted it, and framed a ſet of inſtitutes, under the title of GENERA MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BORUM, as a baſis of his lectures in this depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. LINNAEUS'S ſcheme was firſt publiſhed in a <hi>theſis</hi> in 1759; but he had taught it in his claſs for ten years preceding that time. In 1763, he publiſhed it himſelf in a ſmall quarto; though we do not find that he ever enlarged it by the addition of the <hi>ſpecies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſymptomatic</hi> plan of arranging diſeaſes has ſince been followed by ſome other profeſſors of phyſic; Dr. <hi>Vogel</hi> of <hi>Gottingen</hi> having publiſhed, in 1764, his <hi>Definitiones Generum Morborum.</hi> Dr. <hi>Cullen</hi> alſo, who at this time fills the practical chair at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> with ſuch deſerved reputation, has publiſhed a <hi>Synopſis noſologiae methodicae,</hi> and has made it the baſis of his <hi>Firſt Lines of the Practice of Phyſic.</hi> In 1776, Dr. <hi>Sagar,</hi> a phyſician at <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law</hi> in <hi>Moravia,</hi> publiſhed a <hi>Syſtema Morborum ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomaticum.</hi> 8vo. <hi>Vien.</hi> pp. 756. His work, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome alterations and additions, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an uſeful abridgement of <hi>Sauvages</hi>'s: the author, all theory apart, has deſcribed the <hi>ſpecies</hi> under every <hi>genus,</hi> and ſubjoined the method of cure. Dr. <hi>Cullen,</hi> by omitting many <hi>genera,</hi> and reducing others to the rank of <hi>ſpecies</hi> only, has ſo
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0168400500:175"/>
conſiderably abridged the whole, as not to have retained more than half the number of <hi>genera,</hi> that the foregoing writers enumerate; and in this form he has publiſhed it, annexed to thoſe of the four abovementiond, by which diſplay of each, their ſeveral merits may be compared, and a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment formed of the practicability, and uſe of the ſcheme in general, which, it muſt be confeſſed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a very ample field for cultivation; yet, from that reform which Dr. <hi>Cullen</hi> has already made in various parts, it is not, perhaps, too much to hope, that it is capable of receiving a much higher degree of improvement, in the hands of thoſe whoſe genius and induſtry may prompt them to extend the deſign of theſe writers.</p>
               <p>Of LINNAEUS'S method we are led by our plan to exhibit a general view; to which end, although our preſcribed brevity will not admit of giving his <hi>definitions</hi> at length, yet it will be neceſſary to enumerate the <hi>names</hi> of all his <hi>genera,</hi> ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of a view of the whole collectively, could enable the reader to form a juſt idea of the author's ſcheme. Under each <hi>claſs</hi> we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve wherein LINNAEUS differs materially from <hi>Sauvages,</hi> and note the alterations which Dr. <hi>Cullen</hi> has made in the diſpoſition of the ſame <hi>genera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LINNAEUS, in the claſſification of diſeaſes, has pretty nearly retained the arrangement of M. <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages,</hi> although he has altered his terms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted one more claſs, with which he begins his method; the <hi>Exanthematic,</hi> or eruptive fevers, which, in the ſyſtems of <hi>Sauvages</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cullen,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0168400500:176"/>
form only an <hi>order,</hi> or ſubdiviſion of a claſs. He has alſo changed the order of the claſſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the <hi>Vitia,</hi> or <hi>local external diſorders,</hi> which are principally the objects of ſurgery, to the end of his ſyſtem. In this he has been followed by the two ſucceeding noſologiſts, Dr. <hi>Vogel</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cullen.</hi> The claſſical diſtribution is, however, confeſſedly not the <hi>primary</hi> conſideration; that of fixing the <hi>generical</hi> character, and determining what ſhall conſtitute the <hi>ſpecifical,</hi> being the firſt object of every ſyſtem. To this end a ſtill farther reduction of the number of <hi>genera</hi> and <hi>ſpecies,</hi> will probably not a little contribute.</p>

In this claſs, as the diſeaſe is complicated of fever and eruption, the genus is defined from the nature of each. To inſtance, the <hi>Variola,</hi> or Small pox, is defined, <q rend="margQuotes">A diſeaſe attended with puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules of an eryſipelatous, ſuppurating, eſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotic kind; at length drying off, and leaving a cicatrix; accompanied by a fever of the ardent, and malignant kind, with head-ach and pain of the loins.</q> The term <hi>Puſtula,</hi> and the others in this claſs, expreſſive of the different kinds of eruption, have their definition in another part of the ſyſtem. Such as appear in the Morta, are called <hi>Phlyctenae;</hi> in the Peſtis, <hi>Anthraces,</hi> or <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones;</hi> in the Variola, <hi>Puſtulae;</hi> in the Rubeola, <hi>Papulae;</hi> in the Petechia, <hi>Sudamina.</hi>

                  <p>This claſs conſtitutes the firſt <hi>order</hi> of Dr. <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages</hi>'s PHLEGMASIAE, and the third of Dr. <hi>Cullen</hi>'s PYREXIAE claſs. In both, theſe <hi>genera</hi> are preſerved nearly alike, except that the <hi>Morta</hi> of LINNAEUS is the <hi>Pemphigus</hi> of thoſe authors, and the <hi>Petechia</hi> is conſidered by Dr. <hi>Cullen</hi> as only a <hi>ſymptom.</hi>

                  <p>Dr. <hi>Cullen</hi> hath not introduced into his ſyſtem the lighter affections under the SUFFOCATORII; which ſeem to have been defined and explained by LINNAEUS, principally to uſe them as auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries in other parts of the work.</p>

                  <p>Our author has ſubjoined to this diſtribution of diſeaſes, a brief view of his <hi>Theory of Phyſic,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in that terſe, conciſe, and methodic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo peculiar to himſelf; and which, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been intended entirely for the uſe of his pupils, nothing leſs than the author's own comment can do ſufficient juſtice to. We ſhould not therefore have taken notice of it, in our plan, had it not been neceſſary in order to explain ſeveral
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0168400500:204"/>
papers hereafter to be mentioned in the <hi>Amoenitates Academicae.</hi> Briefly, therefore, the <hi>Linnaean</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of phyſic ſuppoſe the human body to conſiſt of a <hi>cerebroſe medullary</hi> part, of which the nerves are ſo many proceſſes, and which we call the <hi>ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> ſyſtem; and, a <hi>cortical</hi> or vital part, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>vaſcular</hi> ſyſtem and contained fluids: the former, being the animated part, or that in which the <hi>ſentient,</hi> moving principle peculiarly reſides, is conſidered as deriving its <hi>nouriſhment</hi> from the ſubtleſt fluids of the vaſcular ſyſtem, and its <hi>energy</hi> from an electrical principle inhaled by the lungs. Farther, this theory ſuppoſes the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating fluids to be capable of being vitiated, by principles which the author chuſes to conſider either as <hi>aceſcent,</hi> or <hi>putrid</hi> ferments; the former acting on the <hi>ſerum,</hi> and being the exciting cauſe of <hi>critical</hi> fevers; the latter, on the blood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, or <hi>craſſamentum,</hi> and exciting <hi>phlogiſtic</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The <hi>exanthematic</hi> claſs is ſuppoſed to be excited by ſome external cauſes, which we call <hi>Contagion,</hi> and which <hi>hypothetically</hi> he propoſes as being <hi>animalcula.</hi> From the inceſſant attrition of the <hi>cortical</hi> or vaſcular ſyſtem, it requires perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reparation; this is to be effected by an <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate</hi> diet. From an <hi>impropriate</hi> diet, or regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſpring the diſeaſes of this part of the ſyſtem, originally and more particularly; theſe are to be remedied by <hi>ſapid</hi> medicines, as thoſe of the <hi>medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> ſyſtem are by <hi>olids.</hi> Hence ariſes the author's general diviſion of all medicines, as diſcoverable by their ſenſible qualities, to the <hi>taſte,</hi> and <hi>ſmelling.</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0168400500:205"/>
The <hi>Sapids,</hi> according to this theory, acting pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly on the cortical part, as the <hi>Olids</hi> do immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately on the <hi>medullary,</hi> or nervous ſyſtem. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der however to obtain a more complete idea of the effects of each of theſe general claſſes of medicines, each muſt be viewed in its moſt ſimple ſtate, by which <hi>Sapids</hi> will appear to be rather what we call <hi>Nutritives;</hi> and <hi>Olids,</hi> more ſtrictly ſpeaking, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</hi> A table of of the ſeveral <hi>qualities</hi> of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, acording to theſe two general diviſions, cloſes the <hi>Genera Morborum.</hi>

                  <p>In 1766, LINNAEUS publiſhed a ſmall piece, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of CLAVIS MEDICINAE <hi>duplex, exterior et interior.</hi> Holm. 8vo. pp. 29. This ſmall tract may be conſidered as a ſyllabus of his lectures. It is an enlarged view of the theory juſt mentioned, connecting it with general <hi>Pathology,</hi> and the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapeutic part of phyſic. In the latter part all ſimples are arranged in thirty <hi>orders,</hi> according to their ſenſible qualities, agreeably to the theory; which is diſplayed more at large in two papers printed in the <hi>Amoenitates Academicae,</hi> under the titles of <hi>Sapores, et Odores Medicamentorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It appears from ſeveral parts of the writings of LINNAEUS, that the <hi>dietetic</hi> part of phyſic had been an object to which he had paid much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he has explained himſelf in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner relating to it:—<hi>In his meae deliciae, in his plura collegi, quam quod novi alius ullus:</hi>—but, whether our author's obſervations on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may hereafter be publiſhed, we are yet to learn.</p>

In 1771 was publiſhed LINNAEUS'S laſt work, being the continuation of the <hi>Mantiſſa,</hi> in which the work is carried on to 588 pages, under the title of MANTISSA ALTERA.

Theſe will greatly enrich a future edition of his works; and in the preface he has earneſtly intreated ſucceeding editors to pay a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per regard to them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides his ſeparate works, which we have now brought to a concluſion, LINNAEUS wrote a great number of papers on the ſubjects of phyſic and natural hiſtory, which were publiſhed in the <hi>Acta Literaria Upſalienſia,</hi> and in the <hi>Stockholm Acts.</hi> The firſt of theſe works was begun by <hi>Olaus Celſius</hi> in 1720, and continued to the year 1750, and is in Latin, in 5 volumes, quarto. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter publication is in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> language, in the octavo form, and has been continued ever ſince the eſtabliſhment of the academy at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> in 1739, by king <hi>Adolphus.</hi> Many of theſe papers are ſuperſeded by the ſubſequent works of our author, neither would it be within our plan to give a particular detail of them: we are therefore only to ſubjoin a catalogue of theſe detached pieces, and regret that it is not in our power to make it more complete; or to add ſuch, if there be any, as may have been given by LINNAEUS to foreign academies.</p>

In the <hi>Acta Upſalienſia</hi> are the following papers, written by LINNAEUS.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Florula Lapponica,</hi> in 1732. This, as is before obſerved, was our author's firſt publication, and conſiſts only of a bare catalogue of the <hi>Lapland</hi> plants, digeſted into the order of the <hi>ſexual ſyſtem,</hi> of which it is the firſt ſpecimen. The ſecond part of this liſt appears not till the year 1734.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Animalia Regni Sueciae,</hi> in 1736.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Orchides iiſque affines,</hi> in 1740. This catalogue is accompanied by a copious collection of ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyms to each ſpecies.</p>

                     <hi>Euporiſta in Febribus intermittentibus.</hi> This pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as likewiſe ſeveral others, if we miſtake not, was publiſhed, agreeably to a laudable cuſtom of that country, in the yearly <hi>Kalendars,</hi> by which means uſeful intelligence finds its way into the moſt remote and obſcure receſſes of every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in 1742.</p>

                  <p>The manifold uſes of theſe trees, ſome of which were not ſufficiently known in divers parts of the kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> induced our author to throw together all that his extenſive journeys had enabled him to collect thereon, in theſe two papers.</p>

                  <p>It has been before mentioned, that our author has interſperſed, in the <hi>Flora Lapponica,</hi> a great variety of curious particulars, relating to the country, and its inhabitants, their manners, their economy, diſeaſes, &amp;c.: and in the preface he tells us, that he had it in meditation to give the remaining part of the natural hiſtory. This was to have appeared under the title of <hi>Lacheſis Lappo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica;</hi> but it is with great regret that we muſt now give up the expectation of this work. Mr. <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> has informed us, that he once reminded him of it, and received for anſwer,—<hi>nunc nimis ſera nciperem:</hi>

                  <p>We know not of any other publication of LINNAEUS'S after the <hi>Mantiſſa altera,</hi> in 1771; and indeed, the preface to that work is ſufficient to preclude the expectation of any new performance, if his advanced age had not, of itſelf, rendered it ſufficiently improbable after that period.</p>

In the ſpring of the year 1772, Dr. <hi>Murray,</hi> Profeſſor of Phyſic and Botany at <hi>Gottingen,</hi> a <hi>Swede</hi> by birth, who had been educated under LINNAEUS, and had long enjoyed a great ſhare of his confidence and eſteem, paid his Preceptor a viſit: he found his faculties unimpaired, and his ardor for the improvement of ſcience as ſtrong and vigorous as ever. He ſpeaks with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the ſatisfaction he received from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and in the contemplation and inſpection of his muſeum at <hi>Hammarby;</hi> but regretted much to find, that LINNAEUS had no farther thoughts of publiſhing a new edition of his <hi>Syſtem of Nature;</hi> purpoſing only to give a ſupplement. However, before Dr. <hi>Murray</hi> left <hi>Upſal,</hi> he prevailed on him to promiſe that he would tranſmit to him his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional obſervations to the <hi>Syſtema Vegetabilium,</hi> in order to enable him to give a complete edition of that work. This the Profeſſor did; and Dr. <hi>Murray</hi> performed it in the year 1774, very much to the ſatisfaction of all who purſue the LINNAEAN method. The manuſcript additions communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on this occaſion by our author, together with thoſe collected from the ſeveral <hi>Addenda,</hi> and from the <hi>Mantiſſae,</hi> enabled Dr. <hi>Murray</hi> to extend this volume to above one hundred pages beyond that of the 12th edition publiſhed in 1767.</p>
                  <p>It appears that LINNAEUS, upon the whole, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a good conſtitution. At times, however, he had been ſeverely afflicted with an <hi>hemicrania;</hi> and had not been exempted from the gout. How much he ſuffered from this latter diſtemper, we
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0168400500:216"/>
have before mentioned, when treating on the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophia Botanica.</hi> And notwithſtanding the ſound ſtate in which Dr. <hi>Murray</hi> left him, we find, that very ſoon after, his memory became ſomewhat impaired. The conſciouſneſs of this defect was ſaid to have induced him to decline all thoughts of further publications, and to tranſmit to Dr. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> ſuch materials as were in readineſs to compleat future editions of his <hi>Syſtem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſummer of 1776, it was known here that his ſtrength was declining apace, and his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in general much increaſed, he being unable to take his uſual walks in his garden without aſſiſtance. At the latter end of the year he was ſeized with an <hi>apoplexy,</hi> which left him paralytic; and at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year 1777 he ſuffered another ſtroke, which very much impaired his mental powers. Theſe attacks, at his advanced ſtage of life, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that diſſolution was not far off. But the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which was ſaid to have been the more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of his death, was an ulceration of the urinary bladder. Nevertheleſs, he languiſhed through the year, and died on the 11th of <hi>January,</hi> 1778, aged 70 years and 8 months.</p>
                  <p>To the lovers of ſcience it will not appear ſtrange, nor will it be unpleaſant, to hear, that uncommon reſpect was ſhewn to the memory of this great man. We are told, that, <q rend="margQuotes">on his death, a general mourning took place at <hi>Upſal,</hi> and that his funeral proceſſion was attended by the whole univerſity, as well profeſſors as ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and the pall ſupported by ſixteen doctors
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0168400500:217"/>
of phyſic, all of whom had been his pupils.</q> The King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> after the death of LINNAEUS, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a medal to be ſtruck, of which <q rend="margQuotes">one ſide exhibits LINNAEUS'S buſt and name, and the other <hi>Cybele,</hi> in a dejected attitude, holding in her left hand a key, and ſurrounded with ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals and growing plants, with this legend—<hi>Deam luctus angit amiſſi;</hi>—and beneath,—<hi>poſt obitum Upſaliae, die x. Jan.</hi> M.DCC.LXXVIII. <hi>Rege jubente.</hi>
                     </q>—The ſame generous monarch not only honoured the Royal Academy of Sciences with his preſence when LINNAEUS'S commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was held at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> but, as a ſtill higher tribute, in his ſpeech from the throne to the aſſembly of the ſtates, lamented <hi>Sweden</hi>'s loſs by his death. Nor was he honoured only in his own country. The preſent learned and worthy profeſſor of botany at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced an eulogium in honour of LINNAEUS, before his ſtudents, at the opening of his lectures in the ſpring of 1778, but laid alſo the foundation-ſtone of a monument to be raiſed to his memory; which, while it perpetuates the name and merits of LINNAEUS, will do honour to the founder, and, it may be hoped, prove the means of raiſing an emulation favourable to that ſcience which this illuſtrious <hi>Swede</hi> ſo highly dignified and improved. This monument conſiſts of a vaſe, ſupported on a pedeſtal, with this inſcription,

The high reputation which this great man has long held among the naturaliſts throughout the world, might readily perhaps preclude any encomium from our pen; ſince, to all lovers of <hi>natural</hi> ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his <hi>name</hi> itſelf is eulogy, and will doubtleſs very long be inſeparable from the idea of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary merit. Might we, nevertheleſs, be indulged ſo far, we hope the following brief eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of his talents will be thought juſt, and eaſily deduced from an impartial view of his writings.</p>
                  <p>Nature had, in an eminent manner, been liberal in the endowments of his mind. He ſeems to have been poſſeſſed of a lively imagination, corrected however by a ſtrong judgment, and guided by the laws of ſyſtem. Add to theſe, the moſt retentive memory, an unremitting induſtry, and the greateſt perſeverance in all his purſuits; as is evident from that continued vigour with which he proſecuted the deſign, that he appears to have formed ſo early in life, of totally reforming, and fabricating anew the whole ſcience of natural hiſtory: and this fabric he raiſed, and gave to it a degree of perfection unknown before; and had moreover the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common felicity of living to ſee his own ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture riſe above all others, notwithſtanding every diſcouragement its author at firſt laboured under, and the oppoſition it afterwards met with. Neither has any writer more cautiouſly avoided that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon error of building his own fame on the ruin of another man's. He every where acknowledged the ſeveral merits of each author's ſyſtem; and no man appears to have been more ſenſible of the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0168400500:219"/>
                     <hi>defects</hi> of his own. Thoſe anomalies which had principally been the objects of criticiſm, he well knew every <hi>artificial</hi> arrangement muſt abound with; and having laid it down as a firm maxim, that every ſyſtem muſt finally reſt on its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic merit, he willingly commits his own to the judgment of poſterity. Perhaps there is no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of LINNAEUS'S life, which ſhews him in a more dignified light, than his conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his opponents. Diſavowing controverſy, and juſtly conſidering it as an unimportant and fruitleſs ſacrifice of time, he never replied to any, numerous as they were at one ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>To all who ſee the aid this extraordinary man has brought to <hi>natural ſcience,</hi> his talents muſt appear in a very illuſtrious point of view; but more eſpecially to thoſe who, from ſimilarity of taſte, are qualified to ſee more diſtinctly the vaſt extent of his original deſign, the greatneſs of his labour, and the elaborate execution he has given to the whole. He had a happy command of the Latin tongue, which is alone the language of ſcience; and no man ever applied it more ſucceſsfully to his purpoſes, or gave to deſcription ſuch copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, united with that preciſion and conciſeneſs, which ſo eminently characterize his writings.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, we are not to learn, that it has been objected as derogatory to his learning in no ſmall degree, that he has introduced a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of terms not authorized by claſſical authority. But, granting this, it ought to be recollected, that LINNAEUS, in the inveſtigation of nature, has
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0168400500:220"/>
diſcovered a multitude of relations which were entirely unknown to the antients; if therefore there be any force in the objection, it ſhould firſt be ſhewn, that the terms which he has introduced to expreſs theſe relations, are not fairly and analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically deduced from the language; ſince it muſt ſurely be granted, that LINNAEUS could not have ſpoken the language of <hi>natural hiſtory,</hi> as it is known at this day, in that of <hi>Pliny,</hi> or of any claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical writer whatever.</p>
                  <p>The ardor of LINNAEUS'S inclinations to the ſtudy of nature, from his earlieſt years, and that uncommon application which he beſtowed upon it, gave him a moſt comprehenſive view, both of its pleaſures and uſefulneſs, at the ſame time that it opened to him a wide field, hitherto but little cultivated, eſpecially in his own country. Hence he was early led to regret, that the ſtudy of natural hiſtory, as a public inſtitution, had not made its way into the univerſities; in many of which, logical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, and metaphyſical theories, had too long prevailed, to the excluſion of more uſeful ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Availing himſelf therefore of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which he derived from a large ſhare of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and an animated ſtyle, he never failed to diſplay, in a lively and convincing manner, the relation this ſtudy hath to the public good; to incite the great to countenance and protect it; to encourage and allure youth into its purſuits, by opening its manifold ſources of pleaſure to their view, and ſhewing them how greatly this agreeable employment would add, in a variety of inſtances,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0168400500:221"/>
both to their comfort and emolument. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive view of natural hiſtory, as connected with almoſt all the arts of life, did not allow him to confine theſe motives and incitements to thoſe only who were deſigned for the practice of phyſic. He alſo laboured to inſpire the great and opulent with a taſte for this ſtudy; and wiſhed particularly that ſuch as were devoted to an eccleſiaſtic life ſhould ſhare a portion of natural ſcience, not only as a means of ſweetening their rural ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, confined, as many are, perpetually to a country reſidence, but as what would almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably lead, in a variety of inſtances, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries which only ſuch ſituations could give riſe to, and which the learned in great cities could have no opportunities to make. Not to add, that the mutual communication and enlargement of this kind of knowledge among people of equal rank in a country ſituation, muſt prove one of the ſtrongeſt bonds of union and friendſhip, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, in a much higher degree than the uſual periſhing amuſements of the age, to the pleaſures and advantages of ſociety.</p>
                  <p>LINNAEUS lived to enjoy the fruit of his own labour in an uncommon degree. Natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory raiſed itſelf in <hi>Sweden,</hi> under his culture, to a ſtate of perfection unknown elſewhere, and was from thence diſſeminated through all <hi>Europe.</hi> His pupils diſperſed themſelves all over the globe, and with their maſter's fame, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended both ſcience and their own. More than this, he lived to ſee the ſovereigns of <hi>Europe</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0168400500:222"/>
eſtabliſh ſeveral public inſtitutions in favour of this ſtudy, and even profeſſorſhips eſtabliſhed in divers univerſities for the ſame purpoſe, which do honour to their founders and patrons, and which have excited a curioſity for the ſcience, and a ſenſe of its worth, that cannot fail to further its progreſs, and in time raiſe it to that rank, which it is entitled to hold among the purſuits of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>Were it in our power minutely to deſcribe the perſon of our author, in conformity to the cuſtom of biographers, it would be a matter of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the endowments of his mind, and his great talents, have ſo ſuperior a claim to atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the commemoration-ſpeech, delivered by his friend Dr. <hi>Baeck,</hi> phyſician to the king of <hi>Sweden,</hi> LINNAEUS'S ſtature is deſcribed as being <q rend="margQuotes">diminutive; his head large; his look ardent, piercing, and apt to daunt the beholder. His ear not ſenſible to muſic; his temper quick; his memory good, though in the latter period of his life liable to fail him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; his knowledge of languages confined, yet no intereſting diſcovery eſcaped him. In ſummer he uſed to ſleep from ten to three o'clock, in winter from nine to ſix, and inſtantly to ceaſe from his labours when he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not well diſpoſed for them. He was an agreeable companion, of quick ſenſibility, but eaſily appeaſed.</q> Thoſe who would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by forming an idea of his perſon, may be acquainted, that there are extant three half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>length
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0168400500:223"/>
prints of LINNAEUS in his works. Two of theſe are in octavo, and the other in a half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheet, or rather large quarto. The firſt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the <hi>Leipſic</hi> edition of the <hi>Syſtema Naturae,</hi> printed in 1748, and repreſents LINNAEUS, as we apprehend, in about the fortieth year of his age; another, to the ſecond edition of the <hi>Species Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum,</hi> in 1762; and the larger one to the ſixth edition of the <hi>Genera Plantarum,</hi> in 1764. In the firſt and the laſt of theſe, which are by much the better engravings, he is figured in an undreſs, reſting upon a volume of the <hi>Syſtema,</hi> and holding in his hand a ſprig of the LINNAEA, a plant ſo called by Dr. <hi>Gronovius,</hi> in honour of his name. In that of 1762, he is repreſented in a full dreſs, with the <hi>inſignia</hi> of the <hi>Order of the Polar Star</hi> at his breaſt, and <hi>Aurivillius</hi>'s inſcription under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath:

                  </p>
                  <p>The Academy of Sciences at <hi>Stockholm</hi> have, at their own expence, directed that an engraving of his portrait ſhould be made at <hi>Paris,</hi> from an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal picture by the famous <hi>Swediſh</hi> painter <hi>Roſlin.</hi> There is a ſtriking likeneſs alſo exhibited on a large medallion, <hi>a'l'antique,</hi> of almoſt two feet in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, by M. <hi>L'Archeveque.</hi> In <hi>England</hi> we have an elegant ſmall medallion, fabricated by thoſe excellent artiſts Meſſ. <hi>Wedgwood</hi> and <hi>Bently.</hi> It repreſents LINNAEUS in profile, when far advanced in years. The buſt is white, upon a light-blue
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0168400500:224"/>
ground, and the <hi>Linnaea</hi> placed at the breaſt. This is ſaid, by all who knew the profeſſor, to bear the greateſt likeneſs. We regret that it is not in our power to deſcribe the medals which were ſtruck in honour of LINNAEUS by order of ſeveral noblemen of the firſt diſtinction in <hi>Sweden,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that by Count <hi>Teſſin</hi>'s direction, ſince that nobleman was among the firſt who diſcerned and patronized the merit of our author, and ever bore to it the moſt public and honourable teſtimony. This LINNAEUS hath acknowledged in the warmeſt effuſions of gratitude.</p>
                  <p>It hath been obſerved before, that the profeſſor married the daughter of Dr. <hi>More,</hi> the provincial phyſician of <hi>Dalekarlia,</hi> ſoon after he ſettled at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> in 1739. This lady ſurvived him; and he has left a ſon, named <hi>Charles,</hi> and four daughters. The younger <hi>Linnaeus</hi> was demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the botanical garden at <hi>Upſal,</hi> ſo early as the year 1762; having in that, and the ſucceeding year, publiſhed two <hi>Decads of rare Plants,</hi> lately raiſed there, accompanied with the figures. Not long after he was conſtituted joint profeſſor in the botanical chair with his father; and of late years entirely occupied that department. Since the death of his father, we learn that he has obtained ſome of his employments, particularly the profeſſorſhip of the theory of phyſic; and has reſigned that of botany in favour of Dr. <hi>Thunberg.</hi> It has been ſaid, that he intends to publiſh a MANTISSA TERTIA, which his father left nearly finiſhed; alſo ſeveral collections of plants which had been ſent to LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0168400500:225"/>
not long before his death, from the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> and from ſeveral other parts of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elizabeth Chriſtina,</hi> one of the daughters of our author, made herſelf known to the learned world, in 1762, by a diſcovery which was publiſhed in the <hi>Swediſh Acts</hi> of the ſame year. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to a curious, and before quite unobſerved appearance, in the flowers of the <hi>Indian Creſſes,</hi> (Tropaeolum majus) which ſhe had perceived to emit ſpontaneouſly, at certain intervals, ſparks like thoſe of electricity, or rather ſuch as ariſe from a fulminating powder. This was only viſible in the duſk of the evenings, and ceaſed when total darkneſs came on. She had ſhewn this ſingular appearance to her father, and other philoſophers, particularly to Mr. <hi>Wilcke,</hi> a celebrated electrician, who was inclined to believe that it was an electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal phenomenon.</p>

                     <p>From the earlieſt times, the cultivation of the fig-tree has been an important object in all the oriental countries. In this diſſertation we are preſented with a hiſtory of this <hi>genus,</hi> of which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0168400500:228"/>
the writer has enumerated 22 ſpecies: LINNAEUS has however greatly reduced this number, in his <hi>Species Plantarum,</hi> ſince many are varieties effected by culture. That part of the hiſtory of this tree, which for many ages was ſo enigmatical, and which nothing but the doctrine of the ſexes of plants has completely cleared up, namely the huſbandry or <hi>caprification,</hi> as it is called, is more particularly worthy of attention, not only as a ſingular pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon in itſelf, but as it has furniſhed one of the moſt convincing proofs of the reality of the ſexes of plants. Our limits will not allow us to detail this ſubject; in brief it is this:—It is now known, that the flowers of the fig-tree are ſituated within a pulpy receptacle, which we call the <hi>Fig,</hi> or fruit of this tree; of theſe receptacles, in the wild fig-tree, ſome have male flowers only, and others have male and female, both diſtinct, though placed in the ſame receptacle. In the garden, or <hi>cultivated</hi> fig, theſe are found to contain only fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male flowers; which are fecundated by means of a kind of gnat, <hi>(Cynips Pſenes,</hi> Syſt. Nat. 919.) bred in the fruit of the <hi>wild</hi> fig-trees, which pierces that of the <hi>cultivated,</hi> in order to depoſit its eggs within; at the ſame time diffuſing within the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle the <hi>farina</hi> of the male flowers. Without this operation the fruit may ripen, but no <hi>effective</hi> ſeeds are produced: hence the <hi>garden</hi> fig can only be propagated by layers and cuttings, in theſe countries, where the <hi>wild</hi> fig is not known. The proceſs of thus ripening the fruit, in the oriental countries, is not left to nature, but is managed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0168400500:229"/>
with great art, and different degrees of dexterity, ſo as to reward the ſkilful huſbandman with a much larger increaſe of fruit than would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be produced. A tree of the ſame ſize, which, in <hi>Provence,</hi> where caprification is not practiſed, may produce about 25 pounds of fruit, will, by that art, in the <hi>Grecian</hi> iſlands, bring ten times that quantity.</p>

ſame principle, the regular polyedrous figure of all thoſe bodies, called <hi>Chryſtals,</hi> acting upon them during their ſuſpenſion in an aqueous menſtruum; and this he conceived to be equally the caſe, whether theſe bodies are what we uſually call <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> or whether they are <hi>lapidoſe, pyriticoſe,</hi> or <hi>arſenical;</hi> or finally, whether they are ſuch as are termed <hi>metallic</hi> ſalts.

that ſomething of this kind, on a more extended ſcale, written in the language of the country, and adapted to common uſe, could not fail to meet with a favourable reception, and would certainly be highly beneficial, not only by diſcloſing matter of real and inſtant information to many who are ignorant of the various appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that have already been made of plants which are daily neglected, but, by exciting a ſpirit of inveſtigation in general, would doubtleſs lead to new diſcoveries. An <hi>economical Flora,</hi> or <hi>Herbal,</hi> is what we have never yet ſeen; our works that bear the name of <hi>Herbals</hi> treat on plants and trees, as if their utility was alone confined to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of phyſic, and even here, in a variety of inſtances, attribute to them virtues which neither their ſenſible qualities have juſtified, nor experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has aſcertained.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The author has here deſcribed and figured four ſpecies, all of which are found in the inteſtines of animals, chiefly in thoſe of carnivorous quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds; and unhappily two of theſe kinds, but more particularly the <hi>T. Solium,</hi> too frequently infeſt the human body. The ſpecific differences of the <hi>Taeniae</hi> ariſe from the <hi>number and ſituation</hi> of the mouths or ſuckers in each link of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound animal, the hiſtory of which has employed the pens of many ingenious men, and is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding yet involved in conſiderable obſcurity.</p>
                     <p>The Tape-worms moſt commonly infeſting the human body, are thoſe deſcribed by LINNAEUS under the names of <hi>Taenia Solium,</hi> and <hi>Taenia Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garis,</hi> Syſt. Nat. p. 1323, both of which are not
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0168400500:244"/>
unfrequently found extended from the <hi>duodenum,</hi> almoſt through the whole tract of the inteſtines. Much controverſy has been ſpent in determining whether theſe animals have any part that is analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to the brain or head in other animals; our author affirms the contrary, conſidering them as <hi>compound animals,</hi> conſiſting as it were of a chain, every link of which is a perfect animal, furniſhed with a mouth, and all its proper organs, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, when ſeparated from its original chain, of propagating its ſpecies, as if by a vegetative power, and independent of any <hi>oviparous</hi> or <hi>vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous</hi> proceſs. In this idea he is oppoſed by Dr. <hi>Tyſon,</hi> who has figured the head of the <hi>Taenia Solium</hi> in the Philoſophical Tranſactions; (ſee N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 147, and <hi>Lowthrop</hi>'s Abridgment, Vol. iii. p. 130;) as alſo by <hi>Pallas,</hi> in his <hi>Elenchus Zoophytorum,</hi> and by ſome other authors. The <hi>Vermes Cucurbitini,</hi> or gourd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms of foregoing writers, are now however allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the deſcending or poſterior links of the <hi>Taenia Solium,</hi> and theſe, according to LINNAEUS, are again capable of extending themſelves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing another chain. According to <hi>Pallas,</hi> and others, theſe joints are pregnant with <hi>ova.</hi> In either caſe the reaſon is at once ſeen why theſe noxious creatures are with ſuch difficulty expelled from the human body. LINNAEUS however does not deny that they are capable of propagation by <hi>ova</hi> too; and ſays, they are found, though much ſmaller, in muddy ſprings; to which <hi>Pallas</hi> with difficulty aſſents.

we cannot but obſerve, that without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to exiſt elſewhere than in the inteſtines of animals, it is exceedingly difficult to account for the <hi>locality</hi> of the diſeaſe ariſing from theſe worms.</p>
                     <p>We cannot enlarge on this treatiſe conſiſtent with our plan; it muſt be ſufficient to obſerve, that this diſſertation, beſides being in itſelf highly ſatisfactory, may be conſidered as an <hi>index</hi> alſo to thoſe writers that are moſt worthy of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted on the ſame ſubject.</p>

                     <p>The ſubject of this paper is very interſting in botanic ſcience; and being as yet ſomewhat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematical, has exerciſed the pens of ſeveral inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious men, but of none perhaps more ſucceſsfully than that of the late Dr. <hi>Gmelin,</hi> in his <hi>Sermo aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicus, de novorum vegetabilium ortu.</hi> Tubing, 1749. Mr. <hi>Haartman</hi> allows the poſſibility of this origin or new creation of vegetables, ariſing from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>farina</hi> of one ſpecies upon the <hi>piſtil</hi> of another, either of the ſame or of a different <hi>genus,</hi> thus producing what is called a <hi>Hybrid</hi> plant. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this admixture, and production of <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> in the vegetable kingdom, have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; but, as in the animal kingdom, they have not uſually been found to perpetuate themſelves by producing fertile ſeeds. The general effect of culture, and the immenſe number of ſpecies, with which, particularly, many of the <hi>African genera</hi> abound, ſuch as the <hi>Geranium, Erica, Meſembry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthemum,</hi> &amp;c. very much favour this hypotheſis. A catalogue is given of 34 ſpecies of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known plants, ſuppoſed to have originated in this manner, ſpecifying thoſe alſo from which they are ſuſpected to have ſprung; and a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon is made between the ſeveral parts and habit of each, with the correſponding <hi>hybrid</hi> offspring, to ſhew the probability of this origin. Another liſt of many other plants follows, in which the traces are not ſo ſtrongly marked. Among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> indigenous plants, thought to have thus originated,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0168400500:256"/>
we mention the <hi>Veronica Hybrida,</hi> or <hi>Welch</hi> Speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, which is believed to have ariſen from the <hi>Officinalis</hi> and the <hi>Spicata;</hi> as the <hi>Sibthorpia Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paea</hi> is from the Golden Saxifrage, and Marſh Pennywort.</p>

                     <p>The author of this paper begins by giving a general hiſtory of all the material writers on Inſects, and the method in which they have treated the ſubject, whether in relation to the <hi>metamorphoſes</hi> and economy principally, in the manner of <hi>Swam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merdam;</hi> or by giving a detail of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> at large alſo, as <hi>Ray, Reaumur,</hi> and <hi>De Geer,</hi> have done. He then does due honour to the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> on account of the magnificent muſeum which her majeſty had conſtructed at the palace of <hi>Drottning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> which is very ſuperb in <hi>Inſects, Shells, Corals,</hi> and <hi>Chryſtals,</hi> &amp;c. He next exhibits his plan: it conſiſts in arranging all ſuch inſects as are natives of <hi>Sweden,</hi> each under the plant on which it is found, or on which it feeds; the references being made to the <hi>Fauna,</hi> and <hi>Flora Suecica</hi> of LINNAEUS. It would be highly acceptable to thoſe who culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate this branch of natural hiſtory, to ſee this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement augmented by the numerous diſcoveries

that have been made ſince the publication of this tract, as it is a part of the hiſtory of inſects not ſufficiently attended to before; and nothing would conduce more to extend and facilitate the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, or lead more effectually to the means of deſtroying the noxious ſpecies.</p>

                     <p>Intended to awaken curioſity, and excite atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſtudy of inſects, by pointing out the extraordinary inſtincts and properties with which particular kinds are endued; many of whoſe operations were inexplicable, and frequently attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to other cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Nothing exemplifies this truth more than the hiſtory of a minute inſect, or rather worm, of which we have, in this diſſertation, the firſt proper intelligence; it is very curious, and worthy of notice. In <hi>Finland, Bothnia,</hi> and the northern provinces of <hi>Sweden,</hi> it was not unfrequently that people were ſeized with a pungent pain, confined to a point, in the hand, or other expoſed part of the body, which preſently increaſed to a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating degree, hath ſometimes been ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fatal. This diſorder was more particularly obſerved in <hi>Finland,</hi> eſpecially about boggy and marſhy places, and always in autumn. At length it was diſcovered, that this pain inſtantly ſucceeded ſomewhat that dropped out of the air<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in a moment penetrated and buried itſelf in the fleſh. The <hi>Finlanders</hi> had tried variety of applications to no purpoſe, until at length a poultice of curds, or
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0168400500:265"/>
cheeſe, was found the moſt effectual in eaſing the pain; and the event confirmed, that the inſect was allured by this application to leave the fleſh; as on its removal, this worm, no longer than the ſixth of an inch, was found in it, and thus the cauſe of this painful diſeaſe explained. LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS himſelf once ſuffered from this animal the effect here ſpoken of: but we owe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete hiſtory of it, and its place in the Syſtem, to Dr. SOLANDER, who gave it in to the Royal Academy of Sciences at <hi>Upſal.</hi> This worm ſtands in the Syſtem under the name of <hi>Furia Infernalis,</hi> p. 1325; but by what means this creature is raiſed into the air, is as yet unknown.</p>

                     <p>A curious eſſay, perhaps the firſt on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, relating to the <hi>Leafing of Trees</hi> in <hi>Sweden,</hi> being the reſult of a variety of obſervations, made at the requeſt of LINNAEUS himſelf, in almoſt all the provinces of that kingdom, and intended to lead, as if by the dictates of nature, to the true time of committing the grain to the earth. A table is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, ſhewing at one view the days on which 19 ſpecies of trees, all natives of <hi>Sweden,</hi> put forth their leaves in three ſucceſſive years. The ſame table ſhews alſo the day on which <hi>Barley</hi> was ſown and reaped in all the ſame provinces. From an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other table it appears, that at <hi>Pitha,</hi> which lies in about 63 degrees north, from the average of 12 years, there intervene 85 days between the ſowing
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0168400500:267"/>
of barley and its harveſt; and at <hi>Upſal,</hi> in 60 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the average of ſix years turned out to be 105 days.

Another curious obſervation follows from this paper: that, notwithſtanding the difference in the number of days between the ripening of barley in <hi>Lapland</hi> and in <hi>Upland,</hi> it will be found that the greater <hi>length</hi> of days in the former coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, gives a balance of ſun equal to the greater <hi>number</hi> of days in the latter.</p>

                     <p>A conciſe hiſtory of the riſe, fate, and progreſs of botanic ſcience, from the firſt traces of it to the preſent time; divided into four periods or epochs.

The ſecond period commences with the reſtoration of letters, after the taking of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> by the <hi>Turks,</hi> beginning with <hi>Brunfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and ending with the <hi>Bauhines.</hi> The third, which is called the period of <hi>Syſtematics,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

to the time of LINNAEUS, who effected that great reformation in the whole ſcience, by which it is fixed as on a new baſis. The concluſion of this paper contains ſome information relating to the introduction of figures cut in wood for the old herbals; whence it appears, that <hi>Plantin,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous printer of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> monopolized almoſt all the figures of this kind during his time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the principal printer in his day for botanical books. By ſuch means <hi>Norton,</hi> the printer of <hi>Gerard</hi>'s herbal, procured from <hi>Frankfort</hi> all the figures we ſee in his book, which had before ſerved for an edition of <hi>Tabernamontanus</hi>'s herbal in 1588.</p>

reducible to one ſpecies, and diſtinguiſhed from other congenerous animals, ſuch as the <hi>wolf, fox, hyaena,</hi> &amp;c. not only by the curvature of the tail, which is uſually to the left, but by the diſpoſition of the <hi>Suturae Velleris,</hi> or ridges formed by the meeting of the ſeveral courſes of hair on divers parts of the body; and the number and ſituation of the <hi>Verrucae,</hi> or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> warty riſings in the face. In theſe diſtinctions, heretofore unnoticed, all the varieties of this animal agree. Eleven varieties of the <hi>dog</hi>-kind are here ſpecified, after which the properties and uſes, together with the whole of the economy of this <hi>faithful</hi> animal, are fully ſet forth, and his diſeaſes deſcribed. Our author tells us, that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Dalekarlians</hi> are in poſſeſſion of ſome ſecret by which they inſtantly diſarm the moſt furious dog, and oblige him to fly with all his uſual ſigns of fear, becoming ſilent at once, and dropping his tail.

                     <p>The intention of this paper is to prove, that the knowledge of the <hi>Natale Solum,</hi> the natural places of growth of plants, is the true foundation on which the art of gardening ſucceſsfully muſt be built. The author laments that botaniſts and writers of <hi>Florae</hi> have been too remiſs in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of this kind; whence numbers of exotic ſeeds and plants have failed to produce flowers, or to perpetuate themſelves in gardens. He mentions a remarkable inſtance in the <hi>Nitraria Schoberi,</hi>
                        <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0168400500:274"/>
(Spec. Pl. 638.) which remained deſtitute of flowers for 20 years in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> gardens; at length LINNAEUS rendered it fertile, by means of ſalt ſcattered about the roots. The knowledge of the <hi>Stationes Plantarum</hi> is alſo equally uſeful to the practical botaniſt, in aſſiſting his reſearches.</p>
                     <p>Every plant has its natural ſituation and ſoil, in which alone it will thrive, and out of which, in many inſtances, no care or culture will preſerve it alive. The knowledge of this axiom, as far as reſpects indigenous plants, is applicable to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of agriculture, and with this view the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has given an arrangement of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> plants, divided into ſix claſſes, according to their ſeveral places of growth, as follows:

                           <item>1. Aquatics.</item>

                     <p>The author firſt diſcuſſes the utility of ſuch local catalogues, and of adhering to the <hi>trivial</hi> names: he then briefly deſcribes the climate of <hi>Britain,</hi> and its different ſoils and elevations, as favouring the growth of particular plants; enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating ſome of thoſe which are <hi>peculiar</hi> to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and in what way thoſe of <hi>Sweden</hi> differ from ours.

                     <p>The <hi>Herbarium Amboinenſe</hi> is one of the greateſt and moſt magnificent botanic treaſures the world ever ſaw; and which we owe to the ſingular zeal

and induſtry of RUMPHIUS, who lived upwards of 40 years in <hi>Amboina,</hi> and was conſul there under the <hi>Dutch Eaſt India</hi> company. He ſweetened the leiſure hours of his life by an uncommon and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful application to the ſtudy of natural hiſtory, which he purſued in all its branches, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in botany. He had the misfortune to loſe his family by the fatal earthquake of 1674; and ſome years after, having collected his materials for this work, and meditated his return to <hi>Europe,</hi> ſuffered the loſs of his ſight from a cataract, in which ſtate he lived 20 years, and died in 1706.</p>
                     <p>This work comprehends the plants of <hi>Amboina, Malacca, Banda,</hi> and the neighbouring iſlands; and, allowing for the time when it was written, contains excellent deſcriptions of the ſeveral vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables of the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> with a copious account of their uſes; and though inferior to the <hi>Hortus Malabaricus</hi> as to the engravings, excels it in the hiſtory of the ſubjects. There are nearly one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand vegetables deſcribed in this work, of which a great number were entirely new to the <hi>European</hi> botaniſts: of this number upwards of ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred are engraved.</p>
                     <p>The manuſcript was 30 years in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Dutch Eaſt India</hi> company, and was reſcued from oblivion by the intereſt and extraordinary zeal of the editor, Profeſſor <hi>Burman,</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> who, with great induſtry and ſkill, has alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated the ſynonyms as far as poſſible, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined them to each deſcription. He began this
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0168400500:277"/>
publication in 1741, and finiſhed it in 1750, in ſeven volumes folio, except a ſmall ſupplement, which was not publiſhed until 1757. In 1769, the editor rendered his work ſtill more uſeful, by the publication of an alphabetical <hi>index</hi> to theſe volumes, with the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſynonyms; together with a like one adapted to the <hi>Hortus Malaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The pupils of the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſchool much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted, that the <hi>Herbarium Amboinenſe</hi> had not been completed before the publication of LINNAEUS'S <hi>Species Plantarum,</hi> that the ſynonyms might have been introduced. To remedy this defect was the intention of Mr. <hi>Stickman</hi>'s paper, in which the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are arranged in the order of the original work, with the <hi>Linnaean</hi> name annexed to each; and afterwards, as many as could be extricated, are thrown into a <hi>Flora,</hi> according to the Sexual ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>It is to our neighbours the <hi>Dutch</hi> that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſts are obliged for two of the moſt valuable performances that are yet extant in the hiſtory of foreign vegetables: this of <hi>Rumphius,</hi> and the <hi>Hortus Malabaricus</hi> of <hi>Rheede.</hi> But we hope that it will not be long before they will be more indebted to an illuſtrious <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who, in purſuit of the ſame object, has encountered the perils of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit round this globe, for a work, which, from his taſte, his liberality, and zeal for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſcience, may be expected to ſurpaſs thoſe above-mentioned, as well in extent, as in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and elegance of execution.</p>

Of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſpecies thus refuſed, the reader is preſented with a catalogue, from the experiments of a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſerver.

                     <p>The ſubject of this paper, at the time of its publication, excited the attention of the curious throughout <hi>Europe.</hi> That nocturnal change to which certain plants are liable, and which is here analogically called <hi>Sleep,</hi> is more particularly manifeſted in thoſe vegetables that are furniſhed with pinnated leaves, and of theſe the <hi>Diadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phous</hi> claſs affords the greater number. The change conſiſts in the different poſition which the <hi>folioles,</hi> or ſmall leaves, aſſume in the <hi>night</hi>-time, from that which they exhibit by <hi>day.</hi> Slight no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of this faculty are met with in the antients; in this paper the obſervations have been extended ſo far, as to take in upwards of 40 ſpecies, which are here enumerated, and divided into ten claſſes, according to the differences obſervable in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the leaves, during this ſleeping ſtate. The late Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> by a well-inſtituted ſet of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, fully confirmed the idea, that this change
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0168400500:283"/>
was owing to the abſence of light. His experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were made with the <hi>Abrus Precatorius,</hi> or ſcarlet <hi>Indian</hi> Pea, in which plant this change had been obſerved by <hi>Proſper Alpinus,</hi> and in which it is remarkable.</p>

                     <p>This plant, notwithſtanding the name it bears, is very far removed from the <hi>Fungus</hi> tribe, ſince it produces perfectly diſtinct flowers, and belongs to the <hi>Monandria</hi> order of the <hi>Monoecious</hi> claſs, and is called by LINNAEUS, <hi>Cynomorium Coccineum,</hi> Sp. Pl. 1375. The <hi>Malteſe Fungus</hi> is a paraſitical plant, ſingular in its form, which is little more than that of a ſimple ſtalk, about a finger's thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſix or ſeven inches long, and in its ſtate of fructification, the whole plant may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an <hi>Amentum,</hi> or Catkin.

                     <p>The ſubject of this paper will ſcarcely admit of an abridgment, agreeable to our contracted plan. In order the more clearly to underſtand what the author calls the <hi>Metamorphoſis Plantarum,</hi> he delivers, in a brief way, the <hi>Linnaean</hi> doctrine of the phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of plants; which ſuppoſes, that the <hi>flower</hi> is no other than the expanſion or evolution of the trunk or ſtem, in the following arrangement: namely, that the <hi>Cortex,</hi> or outer Bark, is ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately ſpent in forming the <hi>Perianthium,</hi> or Cup; the <hi>Liber,</hi> or inner Bark, in forming the <hi>Corolla</hi> or Petal; the <hi>Lignum,</hi> or woody part, in forming the <hi>Stamina</hi> or Chives; and the <hi>Medulla,</hi> or pithy part, in forming the <hi>Piſtillum,</hi> or Pointal. Hence, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever cauſes can diſturb the uſual, natural, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular expanſion and evolution of theſe parts, may be ſuppoſed to occaſion great variety, and changes in the appearance of plants; and that ſuch effects are brought about by change of climate, different ſoil, ſituation, air, culture, and perhaps various other yet unknown cauſes, is certain. To theſe ſources muſt be traced the varieties we obſerve in the leaves, flowers, and roots, whether permanent, as is the caſe in ſome inſtances, or not. This
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0168400500:285"/>
doctrine is here illuſtrated and confirmed by nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous examples; and the young and inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced botaniſt is guarded againſt the deluſion, frequently occaſioned by the operation of theſe cauſes; which are very extenſive in the vegetable creation.</p>

                     <p>The alps of <hi>Europe</hi> produce a ſet of vegetables very different from, and incapable of culture in, the lower ſituations. The author of this tract, who was a native of one of the provinces border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>alps</hi> of <hi>Lapland,</hi> with a laudable zeal for the improvement of his country, enquires what kinds of vegetables might be cultivated in thoſe deſart regions to the moſt advantage, where ſo few thrive, where ſhrubs ſcarcely ever attain even a moderate ſize, and where a tree will hardly grow erect.</p>
                     <p>To this end, he firſt enumerates all the alpine parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and gives a liſt of 400 plants pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to thoſe ſituations.

                     <head>75. MIGRATIONES AVIUM. <hi>C. D. Ecmark.</hi> 1757.</head>
                     <p>This paper is confeſſedly one of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete that has been publiſhed on this curious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is yet involved in conſiderable obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the <hi>cauſe</hi> of theſe migrations, with reſpect to ſeveral birds, and the places of their reſort, being yet unknown. With reſpect to the greater number, it cannot be doubted but that the facility of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their appropriate food in diſtant countries, in the different ſeaſons, and their ſecurity during in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubation, have the principal ſhare in this part of their economy.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Ecmark</hi> obſerves, that the greater number of migrating birds belong to the <hi>flat-billed</hi> order <hi>(Anſeres),</hi> particularly to the Gooſe and Merganſer <hi>genera;</hi> and to the Waders, <hi>(Grallae):</hi> the former moſtly breed in the extreme north, where, from the relation of LINNAEUS, their number almoſt darkens the air, and they are driven ſouthward by the freezing of the lakes and rivers. Numbers alſo of the ſmall-billed birds <hi>(Paſſeres),</hi> eſpecially thoſe with <hi>ſlender bills,</hi> are of the migrating claſs. The <hi>inſectivorous</hi> retire ſouthwards when our winter advances, as <hi>others</hi> in that ſeaſon viſit us for the ſake of berries.</p>
                     <p>It is no ſmall merit in Mr. <hi>Ecmark,</hi> that in this paper he brings together, in one view, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0168400500:293"/>
than any other writer had done, all the known ſpecies of migrating birds, whether exotic, or indigenous to <hi>Sweden.</hi> He gives a liſt of all ſuch as are mentioned in the writings of <hi>Cateſby, Klein,</hi> and <hi>Haſſelquiſt;</hi> but the moſt conſiderable part of his tract is employed in a methodical enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of the indigenous birds of <hi>Sweden,</hi> under each of which he mentions, as fully as is yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the particular times of their ſeveral migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the places whither they reſort, their food, &amp;c. and interſperſes many other remarks, equally curious and ſatisfactory to thoſe who wiſh for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in this part of natural hiſtory.</p>

                     <p>The author of this tract was phyſician to the fleet of obſervation, which was fitted out in the beginning of the laſt war between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> to act in conjunction with the <hi>Danes,</hi> in the north ſea. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron conſiſted of eight ſhips of the line, beſides frigates. When M. <hi>Bierchen</hi> took his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he found not fewer than 1900 men on the ſick liſt; and that the principal diſeaſes were <hi>Fluxes, Fevers,</hi> and the <hi>Scurvy.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> were attended with great pain in the bowels, extreme weakneſs, fever, and a very weak pulſe. The <hi>Fevers</hi> were of that kind which has been
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0168400500:294"/>
called the <hi>Upſal Fever,</hi> from its having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably epidemical in that city and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. This diſeaſe was evidently of that claſs which is called <hi>putrid,</hi> and was much more acute in ſummer than in autumn. It was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with frequent and obſtinate <hi>haemorrhages</hi> from the noſe, early in the diſeaſe; a quiet kind of <hi>delirium; trembling tongue; twitching tendons; deafneſs; petechiae;</hi> and <hi>vibices</hi> on the ſkin. As the heat declined, <hi>haemorrhages</hi> were not ſo much obſerved; the diſorder attacked with <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude</hi> of body, <hi>vertigo</hi> and <hi>pain</hi> in the head, <hi>cough</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion</hi> of the breaſt; and was afterwards attended with <hi>cardialgia, nauſea, vomiting, turbid,</hi> and ſometimes in the decline, <hi>bloody urine.</hi> Alſo great <hi>proſtration</hi> of ſtrength, <hi>weak pulſe,</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultus tendinum,</hi> were ſymptoms of this fever; and many were ſeized in the beginning with violent <hi>fluxes.</hi> The <hi>Scurvy</hi> ſeems to have been attended with no other than the uſual ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>Our author appears to have been very ſolicitous in his endeavours to find out the cauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme prevalence of this diſeaſe in the fleet. In the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> beſides the uſe of ſalted meats, he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes much to the want of ſufficient exerciſe on board the ſhips; and confirms the obſervations of ſome other writers, that the diſeaſe, independent of regimen or diet, decreaſed when the fleet was out at ſea, and conſequently the ſhips more agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by wind and waves, and the men more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; and that it augmented when they were in a ſtate of inaction in port. He condemns the uſe
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0168400500:295"/>
of fat and lard, as difficult of coction, and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the diſeaſe. In the cure, he recommends acids; and ſays, he uſed principally the <hi>vitriolic:</hi> but above all he celebrates the praiſes of <hi>ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krout;</hi> for the efficacy of which he alſo cites the authority and experience of Sir <hi>John Pringle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He conſiders the <hi>Fevers</hi> as ariſing from impeded perſpiration, co-operating with the effects of cold, moiſt, and foul air; and in <hi>this expedition,</hi> he thinks, the inſufficiency of proper cloathing dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>watches</hi> might not unfrequently be found a prediſpoſing cauſe. He is of opinion that the diſeaſe was contagious; and ſays, many were cured by the early exhibition of <hi>emetics.</hi> In the general method of cure, the practice laid down by our later writers in <hi>England</hi> was ſucceſsfully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fluxes</hi> and <hi>Dyſenteric</hi> diſorders he aſcribes particularly to the prevalence of <hi>ſaline</hi> and <hi>putrid</hi> acrimony in the food of ſeamen; aided by foul air, and want of exerciſe, and propagated at length by contagion too.</p>
                     <p>Our author concludes, by ſuggeſting that there are two cauſes, of a general and permanent nature, which prediſpoſe to theſe diſeaſes in all naval ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions. Theſe are, <hi>impure air,</hi> and a conſtant depreſſion of ſpirits in ſeamen, not hitherto ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently attended to, and inducing a degree of real <hi>Noſtalgia.</hi> He ſeems to be ſufficiently aware of the importance of correcting the firſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends ſtrongly the uſe of <hi>ventilators;</hi> to the other it is not eaſy to apply a remedy. He informs us, that both <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Swiſs</hi> find the greateſt
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0168400500:296"/>
relief, in the <hi>Maladie du pais,</hi> next to their return home, from ſtrong exerciſe: however he hints his wiſhes, that the <hi>pay</hi> of the men was advanced, as one of the beſt means of inſpiring them with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and hilarity, neceſſary to counterbalance this evil, at leaſt in ſome degree.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the ſubject of this paper has been ſo well treated by ſeveral later judicious writers amongſt us, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> phyſician cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with much new matter in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation; but it is nevertheleſs very worthy the regard of all who wiſh to make themſelves acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the diſeaſes of the navy.</p>

                     <p>The fever here deſcribed, which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably epidemical in divers parts of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but particularly at <hi>Upſal,</hi> for ſeveral years before this time, and which had by many been ſuppoſed to be a new diſtemper, Dr. <hi>Boſtrom</hi> conſiders as of the <hi>Remittent</hi> claſs, and common in all other parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> He has determined its type to be that of the <hi>Hemitritaea</hi> of LINNAEUS, (ſee <hi>Gen. Morb.</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 23.) or the <hi>Semitertian</hi> of authors. In ſome years indeed, he obſerves, that it ſeemed to have changed its form, was attended with <hi>Petechiae,</hi> and became contagious, under which appearance it was named <hi>Febris Petechizans,</hi> and <hi>Febris Nervoſa,</hi> when attended particularly with <hi>delirium</hi> and ſpaſms. In its milder ſtate, eſpecially in the ſpring, it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a regular <hi>quotidian,</hi> or <hi>continued tertian</hi> type.</p>

                        <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0168400500:297"/>
In ſeeking the cauſes of the frequency of this fever, in <hi>Upſal</hi> particularly, our author accedes to that opinion which attributes <hi>intermitting</hi> and <hi>exacerbating</hi> fevers to the effects of <hi>moiſt</hi> and <hi>foul</hi> air, and thinks, from the ſituation of the city of <hi>Upſal,</hi> the cloſeneſs of the ſtreets, and eſpecially from the ſtagnating canals and waters, that its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence in that city may fairly be referred to this cauſe. To confirm his opinion, he cites two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable inſtances of cities rendered free from theſe fevers, by leading off, and drying up, ſtagnant and putrid waters.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Prognoſtics,</hi> he ſays, a ſtiffneſs of the neck was not uncommon, and that it uſually betokened a long continuance of the diſeaſe; and frequently ended in convulſions, or other dangerous affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the nervous ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>The cure of this fever was uſually begun by giving gentle <hi>emetics,</hi> and repeating them for a few days occaſionally; without which it was obſerved, that the <hi>bark,</hi> and other remedies, failed to have their proper effect. Gentle <hi>paregorics</hi> and ſaline medicines were interpoſed, and the following preparation of the bark exhibited:—One ounce was infuſed in five ounces of red wine for a few hours, the reſiduum boiled in water to eight ounces, and three ounces of ſyrup of oranges mixed with this tincture and decoction. Of this a doſe was given every two hours. Dr. <hi>Boſtrom</hi> entirely forbids bleeding, having commonly found it hurtful.</p>

                     <p>The purport of this diſſertation is to combat, and aboliſh a long-eſtabliſhed vulgar error, which nevertheleſs prevailed until the time of <hi>Harvey,</hi> among ſome men of conſiderable knowledge, and even now ſtill ſubſiſts among the vulgar, in ſome parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> namely, that one kind of grain was convertible, by different ſoils, into an inferior, diſtinct, and more uſeleſs ſpecies: thus, that <hi>Wheat,</hi> in an impoveriſhed ſoil, would change to <hi>Rye:</hi> this, to <hi>Barley: Barley,</hi> into <hi>Darnel:</hi> this, into <hi>Brome-graſs: Brome-graſs,</hi> into <hi>Oats.</hi> Some of the antients carried their belief farther, ſuppoſing, on the other hand, that in fertile lands, the reverſe would take place. As theſe ideas were repugnant to truth, ſo they were in many caſes unfriendly to improvement. This author, after having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that among the <hi>Romans</hi> the <hi>Res Ruſtica</hi> was held in ſuch eſtimation, that even the men of quality themſelves diſdained not to cultivate agriculture, laments that in modern times it is too much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected by the great; he therefore urges gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0168400500:304"/>
to purſue the hiſtory and philoſophy of vegetables, through the whole extent of them, as the foundation of practical improvements. With this view, he refers them to the many excellent papers thereon, contained in this collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and from the phyſiology of plants, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the mechaniſm of them, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of the parts of fructification, he ſhews the futility of the opinion, which he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to confute, and particularly levels his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt that part of it which has gained the moſt belief, and remained longeſt in the minds of his countrymen and the peaſants, that <hi>Oats</hi> are mutable into <hi>Rye.</hi>

                     <p>A botanical and medical hiſtory of the <hi>Indian Pink,</hi> or Worm-graſs, which has been ſo much uſed, and ſo greatly celebrated, for expelling worms from the human body.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Colliander</hi> does more than barely treat of the plant, having enumerated the ſeveral kinds of worms infeſting the human ſpecies; the <hi>Aſcaris Vermicularis,</hi> and <hi>Lumbricoides,</hi> Syſt. p. 1276, the <hi>Lumbricus Terreſtris,</hi> γ. ib. and the <hi>Taenia,</hi> Syſt. 1324.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0168400500:307"/>
of the plant in queſtion, he recites the ſeveral ſimples which have been conſidered as <hi>Specifics:</hi> among theſe we may note particularly the <hi>Fern,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> as anthelminthic, and lately publiſhed in <hi>France,</hi> as ſuch, at the expence of the king.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory of the <hi>Spigelia,</hi> with a figure annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is then delivered at large, nearly as it ſtands in <hi>Browne</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and in the <hi>Eſſays and Obſervations phyſical and literary,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Lining,</hi> vol. i. p. 386.</p>
                     <p>The ſucceſs of this remedy among the negroes and <hi>Indians</hi> introduced it into practice.

                     <p>It is a <hi>poſtulatum</hi> in the philoſophy of LINNAEUS, that "the qualities of medicines are, in a general way, to be determined by their effect on the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of taſte and ſmelling." And further, that the <hi>"Sapida,</hi> or thoſe which more ſenſibly ſtrike the <hi>taſte</hi> than the ſmell, do principally operate on the <hi>vaſcular</hi> and <hi>vital</hi> ſyſtem:" and that the <hi>"Olida,</hi> or thoſe which more ſenſibly ſtrike the organs of ſmelling, operate on the <hi>medullary</hi> or <hi>nervous</hi> ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem." The <hi>Sapor Medicamentorum</hi> of this collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0168400500:308"/>
N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 30, may be conſidered as a comment on the firſt part of this general diſtribution of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, diſtinguiſhed by the term <hi>Sapida;</hi> and the preſent <hi>theſis</hi> as an explanation of a large diviſion of the <hi>Olida,</hi> here called <hi>Graveolentia,</hi> from their ſtrong and ungrateful ſmell.</p>
                     <p>The combinations of <hi>Sapids</hi> and <hi>Olids</hi> are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable; but that ſimples, ſtrictly of the latter kind, do, in a ſudden and extraordinary manner, exert their influence on the nerves, is certain; though our author contents himſelf with the fact, without enquiring whether the functions of the nerves are performed by means of animal ſpirits, by vibration, the medium of electricity, or by any other way. And from the <hi>Graveolentia,</hi> which are the ſubject of his theſis, he juſtly obſerves, that we derive ſome of the moſt powerful remedies. Of theſe he gives a catalogue, dividing them into three claſſes: 1. SUBINSIPID. 2. ACRID. 3. BIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER: each of which is ſubdivided into two orders, as the ſubjects differ in degrees of ſtrength. The <hi>Subinſipid</hi> contains chiefly the Narcotics: the <hi>Acrid</hi> ſeveral of the purging, and fetid roots; the fetid gums, and carminative ſeeds: the <hi>Bitter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains others of the purging roots and leaves; and ſome of the bitter herbs. Under each, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſpecifies, in technical terms, very briefly, the quality, and the diſeaſes to which it has been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated.</p>
                     <p>He then preſents us with a conciſe, but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive theory, of the operation of this diviſion of the <hi>Olida;</hi> leaving to the conſideration of others, the <hi>Suaveolentia:</hi> after which, follows a general

pathology of thoſe diſeaſes which are remedied by the <hi>Graveolentia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In treating on the uſe of external applications, Dr. <hi>Fagraeus</hi> appears to be diſſatisfied with the common theory of repellents, which are uſually drawn from the ſtyptic claſs; and thinks, that the firſt claſs of <hi>Graveolentia,</hi> the <hi>Narcotics,</hi> which he ſuppoſes to induce a relaxation, or temporary palſy, in an inflamed part, more effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a return of the ſtagnating and accumulating fluids into the circulation, than any ſtyptics can poſſibly effect, and are therefore more juſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to that term.</p>

                     <head>94. ANIMALIA COMPOSITA. <hi>A. Back.</hi> 1759.</head>
                     <p>Under the term <hi>Animalia Compoſita</hi> are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the two laſt orders of the claſs of <hi>Vermes,</hi> making the laſt links in the chain of animal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and thus connecting it with the vegetable kingdom. Theſe (in oppoſition to thoſe of the three foregoing orders of the ſame claſs, which live ſimple and ſeparate from each other) are called <hi>Compound Animals,</hi> as being connected together by one common baſe or ſupport, either in the form of irregular or rudely-branched ſtony maſſes, of a calcareous nature, as the <hi>Lithophyta,</hi> or Corals; or, as fixed to one common ſtalk more or leſs branched, as the <hi>Zoophyta,</hi> or Corallines, and ſome others.</p>
                     <p>In order to give a more perfect idea of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe animals, the author holds forth the general analogy between animals and vegetables, principally to ſhew that the former are not, like the latter, endowed with that multiplicative power of propagating themſelves without the particular energy and exertion of the generative function; whereas the <hi>Animalia Compoſita</hi> ſeem to unite theſe powers, ſince they not only appear to propagate by <hi>eggs,</hi> or <hi>viva ſoboles,</hi> but alſo by progreſſive extenſion and ramification.</p>
                     <p>The animals of the LITHOPHYTA, like the <hi>Teſtacea,</hi> fabricate their own baſe of calcareous
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0168400500:316"/>
matter, forming the whole maſs into tubes, each ending on the ſurface, in pores or cells, according to their ſpecific difference, where alone the animal ſeems to dwell, and extending theſe habitations progreſſively, in the manner of vegetables, leaving the baſe at length to periſh.</p>
                     <p>The animals of the <hi>Zoophyta,</hi> containing the Corallines, &amp;c. particularly the <hi>fixed</hi> ones, approach much nearer than the foregoing to vegetables, both in their texture and form in general, ariſing as if from a root, and forming a ſtem and branches, which are beſet at the extremities and articulations with the animals, or <hi>Polypes,</hi> appearing by the help of glaſſes like ſo many flowers.</p>
                     <p>Since this tract was written, the ſubject has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived much farther illuſtration from the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the late Mr. <hi>Ellis.</hi>

Some of the firſt <hi>Cape of Good Hope</hi> plants that were brought to <hi>Europe,</hi> we owe to <hi>J. Heurnius,</hi> who ſent them to his brother, a profeſſor at <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> and they are figured in <hi>Bodeus á Stapel's Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus,</hi> p. 333; among theſe were the Indian Reed, <hi>(Canna Indica),</hi> the <hi>Haemanthus Coccineus, Stapelia,</hi> the <hi>Aletris Uvaria,</hi> and a few others. But the firſt botaniſt who viſited the <hi>Cape</hi> was <hi>Paul Herman;</hi> he collected 800 ſpecies, then unknown in <hi>Europe:</hi> after him <hi>H. B. Oldenland,</hi> a <hi>Dane,</hi> and <hi>J. Hartog,</hi> a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> both made collections of <hi>African</hi> plants, which at length falling into the hands of the preſent able profeſſor of botany at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> Dr. <hi>John Burman,</hi> he publiſhed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravings of <hi>ten decads</hi> of the more rare kinds. From theſe materials chiefly the preſent <hi>Flora</hi> is compoſed, according to the uſual plan, with the <hi>trivial</hi> names only.</p>
                     <p>Among the plants of the <hi>Cape,</hi> there are 38 <hi>genera</hi> peculiar to that part of the world, ſeveral of which excel all others in the number of ſpecies, as well as in their uncommon and ſuperb appearance. The vaſt number of ſpecies under the ſame genus, ſo frequently met with in that country, ſtrongly favours the idea of the perpetual new origin of plants; and that many, which elſewhere are only <hi>hybrid,</hi> there propagate and become permanent. But <hi>Caffraria,</hi> beyond all other countries, abounds with extenſive genera of plants: the ſucculent kinds, particularly, cover the ſandy ſoil, where nothing but the fact could convince us that vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would in any degree ſucceed. Such are the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0168400500:318"/>
Fig-marygolds, <hi>(Meſembryanthema),</hi> Aloes, <hi>Purſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes,</hi> &amp;c. Among the others, we are aſtoniſhed with the variety of the <hi>Heaths,</hi> (Ericae), <hi>Gerania, Protaeae,</hi> and <hi>Gnaphalia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since the publication of M. <hi>Wannman</hi>'s theſis, great diſcoveries in botany have been made in ſouthern <hi>Africa</hi> by <hi>Thunberg</hi> and <hi>Sparmann,</hi> and by Mr. <hi>Maſſon;</hi> and we have reaſon to expect a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete account of the plants of that country from Dr. <hi>Laurence Burman,</hi> ſon of profeſſor <hi>J. Burman,</hi> who has already given us a compendious liſt of them in his <hi>Flora Indica.</hi>

                     <p>The author begins his ſubject with a conciſe view of the antient and modern theories relating to this obſcure affair He obſerves, that the antient doctrine of <hi>equivocal</hi> generation prevailed in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, until <hi>Harvey</hi> exploded it, and taught that every animal is generated <hi>ex ovo;</hi> and that his ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem may now be conſidered as including a double hypotheſis: firſt, that taught by himſelf, which ſuppoſes the entire rudiments of the future <hi>foetus</hi> to be preſent in the <hi>ovum,</hi> and only waiting for animation from the vivifying principle, or <hi>aura genitalis maſculina;</hi> the other, that of the <hi>ſeminal animalcule</hi> entering into the <hi>ovum,</hi> according to the theory ariſing from <hi>Lewenhoeck</hi>'s microſcopical diſcoveries. We have before obſerved that LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS very early forſook <hi>Lewenhoeck</hi>'s theory, in conſequence of attending <hi>Liëberkuhn</hi>'s demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The argument of the preſent hypotheſis tends to ſhew, that both ſexes are equally efficient in this work; leaning however to the following opinion, "that the external form, as well as the ſpecific energy, of the vital functions, are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally derived from the male parent." This is partly the opinion alſo of the very eminent Dr. <hi>Haller,</hi> Phyſ. § 786. Our intended brevity does not allow us to purſue our author through all his

                     <p>The theory of vegetation built by <hi>Malpighi</hi> and <hi>Grew,</hi> on the anatomy of plants, and that of <hi>Hales</hi> and others, drawn from what may be called their phyſiology, has not been followed in the <hi>Linnaean</hi> ſchool. LINNAEUS early conceived the idea of an analogy between plants and animals, and ſpeaks of vegetables alſo, as conſiſting of a <hi>medullary</hi> and <hi>cortical</hi> ſubſtance, (in the former of which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per life and principle of vegetation reſides, and by which alone it is propagated) conſidering the latter as the organs of nouriſhment to the former. This idea ſeems alſo to have led him to adopt the opinion of <hi>Caeſalpinus,</hi> relating to the evolution of theſe two parts, in the order which is mentioned in the 66th theſis; namely, that the <hi>Cortex,</hi> or outer Bark, is ultimately ſpent in forming the <hi>Perianthium,</hi> or Cup of the flower, beſides which, it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the leaves are produced from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſubſtance only; the <hi>Liber,</hi> or inner Bark, in the Corolla or Petals; the <hi>Lignum,</hi> or woody part,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0168400500:341"/>
in the <hi>Stamina</hi> or Chives; and the <hi>Medulla,</hi> or pithy part, in the <hi>Piſtillum</hi> and Seed.</p>
                     <p>Principally to confirm and illuſtrate theſe <hi>data</hi> is the deſign of this <hi>theſis,</hi> which in fact is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on a part of the 24th ſection of the Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſecond tome of the <hi>Syſtem,</hi> p. 9, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a conciſe view of this doctrine. Before the author proceeds to his immediate ſubject, he reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulates, with the forementioned, ſome other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, relating to the life and organization of vegetables, and then endeavours to prove, by appearances obſervable in plants, that this arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of parts, and this evolution actually exiſts. As this cannot be ſo aptly illuſtrated in annual and other plants, on account of the tender texture, and quick growth, the author endeavours to exemplify it from obſervations made on the bud-bearing trees; in which he obſerves, that the full evolution of the parts, from the origin of the bud to the expanſion of the flower, as the final act of vegetation in each, is a progreſſive work, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of which requires five or ſix years, and that it takes place in the following order: That the <hi>Leaves,</hi> which are unconnected with the <hi>medullary</hi> ſubſtance, and derive their origin from the <hi>cortical,</hi> are the produce of the firſt year; and in plants and trees that are furniſhed with <hi>Bracte,</hi> or floral Leaves, that ſuch are the iſſue of the ſecond year; and the <hi>Perianthium,</hi> or Cup of the flower, of the third; the <hi>Petals</hi> of the fourth; the <hi>Stamina</hi> of the fifth; and the <hi>Piſtil,</hi> &amp;c. of the ſixth. Our author endeavours to ſuſtain this theory

                     <p>He firſt treats on the food of plants; which, without entering into any ſubtle diſquiſitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to its elementary principles and compoſition, is defined to be the watery tincture of the ſoil, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the roots, and tranſmitted to the <hi>medullary</hi> by the vaſcular part of the <hi>cortical</hi> ſubſtance. He eſtabliſhes it as a fact, that too great an afflux of nutriment thrown into the <hi>cortical</hi> part, retards the fructification, by compreſſing the <hi>medullary.</hi> He
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0168400500:343"/>
thinks this is proved by the ſtate of luxuriant plants in general, and by the effects of depriving them of this ſuperfluity: on which head he quotes the experiments of Mr. <hi>Fitzgerald,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the <hi>Philoſ. Tranſact.</hi> vol. lii. p. 71, as confirming the truth of the theory here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
                     <p>After having eſtabliſhed the cortical part as the organ and depoſit of nutriment, he proceeds to ſhew, that <hi>heat alone</hi> excites to action and vigour, the life or protruſive and expanſive force of the medullary part; which is ever ſpent in propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plant, by forming <hi>buds, bulbs,</hi> or <hi>ſeed,</hi> as its final and moſt perfect iſſue: and that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of nature ſucceeds in a proportion equal to the degree of nutriment afforded by the cortical, to that of the heat adminiſtered to the medullary part reſpectively.</p>

                     <p>The laſt chapter is appropriated to the <hi>Involu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Plants</hi> in the Seed, Buds, and Bulbs; in which he aſſerts, that in the ſeeds of the <hi>Nymphaea Nelumbo,</hi> the very leaves of the future plant are viſible.

                     <p>After ſome general phyſiological obſervations on the effects of exerciſe, the writer diſplays its efficacy as a <hi>preſervative;</hi> in ſtrengthening the body, procuring the moſt genial warmth, helping digeſtion, increaſing perſpiration, and promoting all the excretions in due time and proportion; in procuring the moſt refreſhing ſleep, and, in vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinary habits particularly, ſubduing that fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſource of diſeaſe, acidities in the firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.</p>

                     <p>It ſhewed itſelf in <hi>tubercles,</hi> or nodes, fixed in the fleſhy parts, in the forehead, cheeks, arms, hands, and thighs; theſe were indolent, moveable with the finger, and of a livid hue.

of the ſcience according to the <hi>Linnaean</hi> method, and a full explanation of the terms therein employed. It is divided into four parts. In the firſt, the author gives a brief hiſtory of Ornitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts, amongſt whom he places <hi>Belon</hi> and <hi>Geſner,</hi> as the firſt authors worth attention, deſcending to <hi>Aldrovandus, Marcgrave,</hi> WILLOUGHBY, and RAY, before any thing like ſyſtem was introduced. To theſe ſucceed <hi>Rudbeck,</hi> whoſe collection of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet unpubliſhed, are in the hands of M. <hi>de Geer; Albin, Cateſby,</hi> and <hi>Edwards,</hi> the laſt of whom, from his unwearied diligence, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities that his ſituation at <hi>London</hi> afforded him, had excelled all others. To theſe muſt be added M. <hi>Briſſon</hi>'s publication of <hi>Reaumur</hi>'s col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, as alſo <hi>Klein, Brunniche,</hi> and <hi>Barrere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſecond part, the anatomical ſtructure and external form of this order of animals are deſcribed. Firſt, the form in general; then the particular parts, explaining under each the terms uſed in deſcribing them, and in forming the <hi>generical</hi> and <hi>ſpecific characters.</hi> This part is illuſtrated with a plate, which has been copied into ſeveral ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing works on this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>The third treats on the hiſtory of birds; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting their habitations, migrations, incubation, and the whole of their natural economy. To which is ſubjoined the method of conſtructing ſcientific deſcriptions, and generical characters.</p>
                     <p>The fourth exhibits a general view of the uſe of birds in the police of nature; in diet, and their utility to man: and here we cannot but note the <hi>Chavaria</hi>
                        <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0168400500:356"/>
of <hi>Jacquin,</hi> a ſpecies of the <hi>Parra</hi> (Syſt. p. 260) which is trained by the <hi>Indians</hi> in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> who breed large flocks of poultry, that ſtray in the woods, to defend them againſt the numerous birds of prey, no one of which will dare to encounter this bird. It is never known to deſert the flock, and returns every even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rooſt. Our author touches on the prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtics of birds in preſaging weather, ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by ſeamen; and finally, as beautiful and pleaſurable objects to man.</p>

                     <p>The knowledge of inſects may be ſaid to be the laſt branch of natural hiſtory that raiſed its head; notwithſtanding which, it has of late attained a high degree of perfection: nor can it be too much to attribute this to the excellent arrangement of LINNAEUS, under whoſe auſpices it has extended it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beyond all other parts of zoology.</p>
                     <p>The plan of this paper is exactly that of the foregoing, and will amply ſatisfy thoſe who wiſh to enter on the ſtudy of inſects. In his firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Mr. <hi>Bladh</hi> gives a chronological liſt of 32 writers on the ſubject, beginning with <hi>Mouffet,</hi> who publiſhed in 1634, and ending with <hi>Schaeffer</hi> in 1767.

                     <p>M. <hi>Gahn</hi> profeſſes to have undertaken this tract, partly with a view to aid the good deſigns of thoſe <hi>ſocieties,</hi> which, to the honour of their founders, have been eſtabliſhed in ſeveral parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the advancement of agriculture; with which the ſubject of this paper is intimately connected.</p>
                     <p>In this large natural claſs of plants, called <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi> are comprehended alſo the <hi>Cerealia</hi> or Grain, and, including all that are hitherto known, do not amount in the Syſtem of our author to fewer than 430 ſpecies; in that of others to many more. Such a number of plants, ſo nearly alike in their habit as theſe, muſt require numerous ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and nice diſtinctions, to diſcriminate each ſpecies. To effect this is the intention of this tract, in which, after ſome curious preliminary obſervations, relating to the ſtation and uſes that nature ſeems to have aſſigned to ſome particular ſpecies, and a liſt of the common graſſes, claſſed according to their native places, the author pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with an hiſtorical account of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal writers who have treated ſeparately on this claſs, exhibiting under each a brief view of their ſyſtems of claſſification. Theſe are <hi>C. Bauhine, Rudbeck, Ray,</hi> and above all, <hi>Scheuchzer,</hi> who with incredible labour has deſcribed all the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. To theſe might be added ſeveral other writers, who have alſo illuſtrated this branch of botany, particularly <hi>Moriſon</hi> and <hi>Haller.</hi> Then follows the deſcription of the natural character

and habit of a plant of this claſs, intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey a full explanation of the <hi>terms,</hi> referring to two explanatory plates, on which is engraven a flower of each genus.</p>
                     <p>Various have been the methods invented to claſs this tribe; our author here gives them a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, entirely independent on the ſexual ſyſtem, eſtabliſhed on the <hi>figure</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of the valves compoſing the Glume or <hi>Calix;</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>flower,</hi> claſſed under two general heads, as they grow either in the form of <hi>Spikes</hi> or <hi>Panicles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all <hi>natural claſſes</hi> the diſtinctions of the genera depend on minute differences, which require very nice diſcriminations; the author therefore proceeds to point theſe out in ſeveral inſtances of this tribe: he has alſo added the <hi>exceptions</hi> that ariſe under the ſeveral genera in various ſpecies, an imperfection that attends all ſyſtems. He concludes with a full explanation of his tables, which are better adapted to convey to a learner a true idea of this claſs, than any that we are yet acquainted with; ſince <hi>Schreber</hi>'s tables are not adapted to common uſe in <hi>England.</hi>

Man is the only animal accuſtomed to hot foods, and is almoſt alone affected with carious teeth. Hence he takes occaſion to condemn, in a forcible manner, the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of drinking hot tea, coffee, and chocolate, and

diſſuade his countrymen from the practice of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot bread, boiled rice, puddings, and other like foods, to which perhaps, from the ſeverity of the climate, the <hi>Swedes</hi> are more addicted than ſome other nations.

It was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that there was but one ſpecies; but the <hi>Green Tea</hi> is now ſaid to be the produce of another, which differs from the <hi>Bohea,</hi> in having nine pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in the flower, whereas the Bohea hath but ſix.

But to return to our author.</p>
                     <p>He next conſiders the ſenſible qualities of <hi>Tea,</hi> its fragrant odour, and ſtyptic taſte; and from its place in the Syſtem, botanically conſidered, with reſpect to the <hi>natural orders,</hi> he thinks it highly probable, that what <hi>Kaempfer</hi> relates of its <hi>narcotic</hi> quality, when green, is conſonant to truth. And, from ſimilar inſtances, he proves that this quality may readily be thrown off by that degree of heat which the ſudden exſiccation of the leaves require.</p>
                     <p>In diſcuſſing the virtues of Tea, he obſerves, that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> recommend the uſe of it in all lethargic
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0168400500:363"/>
diſeaſes, but condemn it in ophthalmies, colics, and palſies. From <hi>Kalm,</hi> he tells us, the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>North America</hi> knew not the inconveniences of carious teeth, debilitated ſtomachs, nor the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men difficult labours, until the introduction of Tea among them. That the phyſicians at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Amſterdam,</hi> &amp;c. attribute the frequency of the <hi>Leucorrhaea</hi> among the women of condition to their indulgence in this liquor. And further, that <hi>Boerhaave</hi> aſcribed to the ſipping hot Tea, a ſchirroſity in the glands of the oeſophagus, which he met with on diſſection, and which he thought a diſeaſe not known to the antients.</p>
                     <p>The author ſubjoins ſome obſervations on the important and extenſive influence of Tea in a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile view, and as an article of luxury; and concludes with the hiſtory of the introduction of the living plant into <hi>Europe,</hi> as above mentioned, hinting alſo at the poſſibility of naturalizing it in other countries.

We are preſented with three methods of prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chocolate, as practiſed by the <hi>Indians,</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by others, as follow: The <hi>Indians,</hi> to one pound of the roaſted nuts, put half a pound of ſugar, diſſolved in roſe-water, and half a pound of flour of Mays, or <hi>Indian</hi> corn. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to ſix pounds of the nut, add three and an half of ſugar, ſeven pods of vanillas, one pound and an half of flour of <hi>Indian</hi> corn, half a pound of cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſix cloves, one drachm of capſicum, and whatſoever is thought requiſite of the roucou-nut to improve the colour, together with amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe or muſk, to impart an agreeable ſcent. In <hi>the other,</hi> and more common way, to ſeventeen pounds of nuts are added ten pounds of ſugar, twenty-eight pods of vanillas, one drachm of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergreaſe, and ſix ounces of cinnamon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vanillas</hi> are the pods ſilled with minute ſeeds, from a paraſitical climbing plant, deſcribed under the name of <hi>Epidendrum Vanilla,</hi> Sp.

                     <p>In a foregoing part of theſe memoirs, a ſhort account was given of LINNAEUS'S <hi>Theory of Phyſic,</hi> or his <hi>Clavis Medicinae;</hi> in which was obſerved the diſtinction that he has made between the <hi>cortical</hi> and <hi>medullary,</hi> or in other words, the <hi>vaſcular</hi> and <hi>nervous</hi> ſyſtems of the human body. The preſent diſſertation is a comment on the firſt part of the <hi>Clavis,</hi> relating to the diſeaſes of the vaſcular ſyſtem. Dr. <hi>Bergman</hi> traces the immediate effects, both upon the ſolids and fluids, of any exceſs or defect in the <hi>Air, Nouriſhment, Motion</hi> and <hi>Reſt, Sleep</hi> and <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Excretions</hi> and <hi>Retentions.</hi> The <hi>Paſſions,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more immediately connected with the <hi>medullary,</hi> or nervous ſyſtem, do not belong to his ſcheme. Having diſcuſſed the ill conſequences of theſe errors to the conſtitution, and remarked the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes originating from thence, he turns to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the old canon, "that diſeaſes are cured by their contraries," and, agreeably to the theory of his maſter, that ſuch as ſpring from theſe errors are principally the objects of dietetic medicine, and are to be cured by <hi>Sapids,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the ſeveral claſſes of <hi>Aquoſa, Sicca, Acida, Amara, Pinguia, Styptica, Dulcia, Acria, Mucoſa, Salſa,</hi> and ſhews their power in preventing and curing diſeaſes; concluding his tract with the diſtinction between the rational and empirical phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</p>
                     <p>In mentioning the ſcurvy, and the effects of ſalted meat, he relates a memorable inſtance of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0168400500:371"/>
an arthritic patient, who, after taking, in one ſummer, 1800 boles of Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s medicine, became in the higheſt degree afflicted with the genuine ſcurvy, which he thinks might fairly be attributed to the quantity of alkaline ſalt contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that medicine.</p>

                     <p>This ingenious diſcourſe, written by a young <hi>Ruſſian</hi> nobleman, a ſtudent at <hi>Upſal,</hi> is one of the moſt entertaining and beſt-digeſted papers on the ſubject, that this collection affords, and cannot fail to carry conviction with it. It is divided into two parts: in the firſt, he diſplays the neceſſity of a knowledge of natural hiſtory at large, in leading the way to improvements in all branches of agriculture, and in gardening: the utility eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of being acquainted with the indigenous plants of the country, an object greatly neglected, and which, if more attended to, muſt lead, as he endeavours to ſhew, to the improvement of woods, hedges, the culture of barren ground, wet mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; to the extirpation of hurtful plants, and the better adapting paſtures to the ſeveral kinds of cattle. To illuſtrate this latter poſition, he mentions a memorable fact, related by LINNAEUS in the <hi>Iter Scanicum,</hi> of a number of goats which were periſhing in an iſland that abounded with the Reed Bent Graſs, <hi>(Agroſtis arundinacea)</hi> a plant on which horſes feed with avidity, and thrive
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0168400500:374"/>
greatly. Thus alſo, on the other hand, goats will riot and fatten on the Meadow Sweet, <hi>(Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendula Ulmaria),</hi> whilſt horſes, and horned cattle eſpecially when they are young, will not touch it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part abounds with curious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the economy of domeſticated ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; in treating on which he points out both the moſt nutritive and noxious herbs to each ſpecies; deſcending afterwards to domeſtic fowls, and the inferior parts of the animal creation, which are more particularly the objects of huſbandmen.

Theſe fruits are uſually the <hi>Caſſia Fiſtula: Anacardium,</hi> or Cuſhew Nuts: <hi>Cucurbitae Lagenariae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>The author next purſues his catalogue through all the claſſes of animals, uſing only the <hi>Linnaean</hi> trivial names, and referring to the <hi>Fauna Suecica,</hi> to <hi>Gunner,</hi> and to <hi>Strom.</hi> It may be obſerved, that the latter writer thinks that what deceived the fiſhermen, and by their means Biſhop <hi>Pontoppidan,</hi> under the appearance of a ſerpent of the extraordinary length deſcribed in his <hi>Hiſtory of Norway,</hi> was no other than a ſtring of ſturgeon, which, at the ſtated time of the year, follow each other in a line in immenſe

                     <p>The remaining part of the tract chiefly reſpects the medicinal plants, and the diſeaſes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. An account of ſome vegetable productions, which form an article of commerce, being exported in conſiderable quantities, among which are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Cloud-berry, <hi>(Rubus Chamaemorus,</hi> Sp.

Then follows a liſt of medicines eaſily obtained, or ſuch as are in uſe among the country people. Among theſe the good effects of the <hi>Linnaea borealis,</hi> Sp. Pl. 880, in rheumatic diſorders, are well known, and much celebrated. He relates, on the authority of the Preſident himſelf, that two men, who had been confined to their bed for ſeveral months by iſchiatic pains, were cured in three days by a ſtrong decoction of it. Its operation appears to have been of the ſedative kind, ſince the patients were thrown into a ſleep, which laſted ſixteen or twenty hours. He confirms the opinion of the <hi>Lepra</hi> ariſing from the <hi>Hair Worm,</hi> as mentioned in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 131 of this collection; and has ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations relating to the <hi>Colica Lapponum,</hi> deſcribed in M. <hi>Montin</hi>'s theſis, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 27.

               <p>THE ſcience of botany certainly holds its moſt dignified ſtation when ſubſervient to <hi>medicine;</hi> but its utility does not terminate in this alone, though it has too long been conſidered as having no other connection. This, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is but a partial, nay even an injurious idea of it, for nothing has more retarded its uſefulneſs than this contracted notion. It has a relation, in a variety of ways, to many other arts and ſciences. Among which may be mentioned the <hi>art of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dying;</hi> but of all others <hi>Agriculture</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly claims the ſtricteſt relation, ſome of its moſt important branches being greatly dependent upon it, and others, from an happy application of it, being perhaps capable of further emolument. The ſubſequent paper, it is preſumed, will, in ſome meaſure, illuſtrate this truth. But howſoever great the real dignity and importance of this art, yet, it muſt be allowed, that it has not been cultivated ſufficiently on ſcientific principles, nor advanced in equal proportion with other branches of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It is not many years ſince Dr. <hi>Home</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0168400500:380"/>
that <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Columella,</hi> old as they are, remained almoſt the only writers worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting upon this ſubject. The writings of Mr. <hi>Hart,</hi> Dr. <hi>A. Hunter,</hi> Lord <hi>Kaims,</hi> Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> and of many others ſince publiſhed in our own nation, we hope have ſuperſeded Dr. <hi>Home</hi>'s remark; and, from that laudable ſpirit now diffuſing among us throughout <hi>Great Britain,</hi> for the improvement of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> under the protection of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic inſtitutions, we may expect to ſee every branch of agriculture ſtudied as it deſerves, and attended with that ſucceſs which commonly reſults from the right application of knowledge to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of human life. On the continent, the <hi>Swedes</hi> are making large and daily progreſs in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this branch of <hi>economics.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> Mr. <hi>Du Hamel</hi> has rendered himſelf conſpicuous by his writings on this ſubject; and in various parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſocieties have been formed with a profeſſed view to this end. We cannot help mentioning, with peculiar pleaſure, that of <hi>Padua,</hi> over which Dr. <hi>Arduin</hi> preſides, who, by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the <hi>Venetian</hi> ſtate, has a garden allotted for the cultivation of ſuch vegetables as they wiſh to ſubject to experiments in agriculture, dyeing, and other arts. A noble inſtitution, and worthy of imitation!</p>
               <p>Amidſt that almoſt infinite variety of vegetables, with which the beneficent hand of nature has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed our earth, thoſe which go under the general name of <hi>Graſſes</hi> form the principal food of our cattle; next to theſe, among the <hi>natural claſſes</hi> of plants, none are more acceptable than the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0168400500:381"/>
                  <hi>diadelphous</hi> or leguminous herbs: of this claſs is the <hi>Clover,</hi> ſo much cultivated in <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Saint Foin,</hi> or <hi>Cocks-head;</hi> and the <hi>Lucern,</hi> or Medic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fodder, in <hi>France.</hi> Beſides theſe, our horſes, horned cattle, ſheep, &amp;c. will all, in their turn, eat with equal pleaſure, and ſome with more avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, a great variety of other vegetables. Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inſtances occur where one ſpecies of animals will feed greedily upon thoſe herbs which others refuſe to touch, and will even almoſt famiſh rather than eat. Some plants are highly noxious, and even poiſonous, to certain kinds of animals, while they are eaten by others without the leaſt ſubſequent ill effect: to inſtance, the <hi>Cicuta Viroſa,</hi> or long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaved Water Hemlock, the moſt virulent plant which grows ſpontaneouſly in <hi>England,</hi> (but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily is not common) is fatal to cows, when, through ſcarcity of food, they are obliged to eat it; yet ſheep and horſes feed on it with impunity, and goats even greedily devour it.</p>

Facts of this kind muſt, in ſome meaſure, have been obvious to the moſt incurious of mankind, even in the earlieſt ages. The firſt race of ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds had daily inſtances, among their flocks, of the ſelection and refuſal of particular herbs, and ſubſequent obſervations muſt have multiplied and confirmed them. But they were ſtill only known in the general, and no <hi>experiments</hi> had been inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to aſcertain the <hi>preciſe ſpecies</hi> thus eaten or
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0168400500:382"/>
rejected. The facts are, at this time, undeniable. It is well known that <hi>Flag-flowers, Hounds-tongue, Henbane, Mullein, Nightſhade, Hemlock,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Docks, Arſmart, Agrimony, Celandine,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Crowfoots, Marſh Marigold, Horehound, Figwort,</hi> many <hi>Thiſtles, Fern,</hi> and other plants, are commonly neglected by our horſes, and horned cattle, and ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, even in paſtures where it might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that neceſſity ſhould conſtrain them to eat any thing. Theſe are but a few out of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; there are more than is commonly imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it was deſirable, in conſequence of theſe obſervations, that a courſe of experiments ſhould be inſtituted to elucidate this inſtinct, in that part eſpecially of the brute creation which is ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſubſervient to mankind. The utility of ſuch experiments muſt be evident, as they muſt neceſſarily lay the foundation of farther improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the economy of cattle. The intelligent huſbandman would, by this means, have it in his power to rid his paſtures of noxious and uſeleſs plants, and give room for the ſalubrious ones.</p>
               <p>In this view of the affair, it will be ſeen that phyſicians are not the only perſons who may ſtudy botany to advantage; many others would find, not only a fund of pleaſure from this ſtudy, but numberleſs other advantages reſulting from the knowledge of the plants of their own country. In the inſtance before us, ſcience has opened the way, and ſurely it is not too much to ſay, that it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently points to greater improvements, in one of the moſt important branches of agriculture, as it relates to the economy of cattle. More than this
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0168400500:383"/>
ought not to be expected from its aid. It is to the intelligent grazier and the gentleman, well verſed in the knowledge of the <hi>indigenous</hi> plants, fraught with careful obſervation, and practiſed in the eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of cattle, that the reſt muſt be owing. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the want of this knowledge, in ſuch gentlemen as reſide in the country chiefly, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the benefit which might otherwiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue from reducing it into practice. The eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating from paſtures poiſonous and uſeleſs weeds, would be but one, although indeed no mean one, among many other advantages. Further than this, the huſbandman would be better enabled to ſuit his ſeveral ſorts of cattle to the different paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in his poſſeſſion, more to their benefit, and conſequently his own. Even in marſhy grounds, where it is a difficult undertaking to mend the ſoil, the growth of many plants might be encouraged, and the ſeeds of others ſown, which are highly acceptable to different kinds of cattle. By degrees too we ſhould undoubtedly be led to the cultivation of other vegetables beſides <hi>clover,</hi> as fodder; and the foregoing obſervations imply, that this might be done in ſoils and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where that would not thrive. Our hay would in conſequence be much improved; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though cattle will eat thoſe herbs among hay, which they reject while green and growing, yet it does not follow that all are in their dried ſtate equally nutritive and wholeſome. The benefits, in fine, which would ariſe from a diligent and general purſuit of theſe hints, would undoubtedly be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and extenſive, and many more, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0168400500:384"/>
in a courſe of years, than can at preſent be thought of.</p>
               <p>Agreeably to theſe ideas, a beginning has been made, under the auſpices of our celebrated author, whoſe attempt was truly laudable, and worthy of himſelf. To this end, it is indeed certainly the province of the botaniſt to make the plants of his own country the principal objects of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This has been eminently the caſe with LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS, and his country will continue to reap the fruit of his labours. The reſult of theſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be ſeen in a paper, called PAN SUECUS, printed in the ſecond volume of the <hi>Amoenitates Academicae,</hi> the ſubſtance of which, ſo far as the experiments were made with plants common to this country, will be exhibited in the ſubſequent pages.</p>
               <p>LINNAEUS conceived the firſt deſign of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution from obſervations made in his <hi>Dalekarlian</hi> journey, which has been mentioned in the courſe of the preceding pages: he obſerved, that his horſes left untouched, among other plants, <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-ſweet, Great Wild Valerian, Lilly of the Valley, Angelica, Roſe-bay Willow Herb, Marſh Cinquefoil, Mountain Crowfoot Crane's-bill, Globe Crowfoot,</hi> and various ſhrubs. It was not till ſeveral years after, that theſe experiments were inſtituted; in which a number of his pupils were engaged; eight or nine of whom he mentions by name, and he had himſelf a large ſhare in directing and conducting them. More than two thouſand experiments were tried upon the <hi>horned cattle, goats, ſheep, horſes,</hi> and <hi>hogs:</hi> many were repeated ten, and ſome twenty
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0168400500:385"/>
times, with the ſole view of determining what vegetables theſe ſeveral animals would eat or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. It is eaſy to ſee that numberleſs difficulties muſt ariſe in the proſecution of this ſcheme, and that imperfection, in a variety of inſtances, muſt at laſt attend their greateſt accuracy. In the mean time, care was taken, as far as circumſtances would admit, that the experiments were made as unexceptionably as poſſible; and it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the reſult upon the whole is true, as they have a real foundation in thoſe unerring laws of inſtinct, to which nature has ſubjected the whole brute creation. The plants were all freſh gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not bruiſed in collecting, nor offered to the cattle when they were either almoſt famiſhed, or glutted with variety; nor yet in the ſpring-time, when many of them greedily devour almoſt any vegetable they can get, ſometimes ſuch as are fatal to them, and which at other times they will not touch. The plants were alſo, in many examples, offered to ſeveral individuals of the ſame ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Theſe trials were made only with the indigenous plants of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which are (at leaſt three fourths) the ſame as ours in <hi>England.</hi> The plants growing ſpontaneouſly in <hi>Sweden,</hi> excluſive of the moſſes and funguſes, amount to about 900 ſpecies. Of ſuch a number, in every country, many muſt be very rare; it is not therefore to be expected that all theſe could be brought to trial. Some, although plentiful in one part of the country, would be very ſparingly found in another. From the reſult it appeared, that the <hi>horned cattle</hi> eat of the plants which were offered to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only 276 ſpecies, and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0168400500:386"/>
that they rejected 218. The <hi>goats,</hi> of 449 kinds, refuſing 126. The <hi>ſheep,</hi> of 387, refuſing 141. The <hi>horſes,</hi> of 262 ſpecies, refuſing 212. And of thoſe which were offered to <hi>ſwine,</hi> they eat 72 kinds, and refuſed 171.</p>

                     </gap> Suecus,</hi> it may be preſumed, is but in few hands, at leaſt of ſuch whom the ſubject moſt concerns. It is written in Latin, and put into the moſt compendious form imaginable, by inſerting only the <hi>trivial</hi> names of the plants, and referring to the number in the <hi>Flora Suecica,</hi> where the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonyms are given. In this form it is almoſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to perſons unacquainted with LINNAEUS'S writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> reader is entirely hid. It appeared of importance enough to be thrown into an <hi>Engliſh</hi> dreſs, to which end it was neceſſary to give it a form different from the original.</p>
               <p>So far as the trials were made with plants which are common to both countries, the reſult may be ſeen in the following pages, and they amount to no very inconſiderable number. Being taken <hi>nearly</hi> in the order in which they ſtood in the original paper, ſo the ſexual ſyſtem is of courſe preſerved. Yet perhaps a more apt diſpoſition of them might have been given, by arranging them according to their uſual places of growth.</p>
               <p>In order to render it more generally intelligible and acceptable, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name of the plant is firſt given, then the <hi>Linnaean</hi> generical and trivial name, by which it may inſtantly be found, either in LINNAEUS'S own works, or in Mr. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Flora Anglica.</hi> To theſe follow three columns. The firſt contains the reference to the page in Dr.
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0168400500:387"/>
                  <hi>Hill</hi>'s <hi>Britiſh Herbal,</hi> which it may be preſumed is in many hands, and which has now ſuperſeded, in a great meaſure, the <hi>Herbals</hi> of <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Perkinſon,</hi> being better accommodated to the purpoſes of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanic intelligence, and furniſhed alſo with figures. The ſecond column refers to the page in RAY'S <hi>Synopſis of Britiſh Plants,</hi> where the ſynonyms of the two <hi>Bauhines,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Parkinſon,</hi> are quoted. By this means the reader is very compendiouſly directed to a variety of authors on each plant. For the ſake of thoſe who wiſh to ſee an accurate figure, a reference to the <hi>Flora Danica</hi> is added, a work coming out at the expence of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and intended to contain all the indigenous plants of that kingdom, of which 840 plates are already done. Of theſe above 500 are natives of this kingdom, on which account it ſupplies, ſo far, the want of a work of the ſame kind here. It muſt, however, be obſerved, that in this column, under the <hi>Graſſes,</hi> thoſe excellent tables in <hi>Moriſon</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtoria</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">On this head it is much to be regretted, that theſe tables are not republiſhed ſeparately, with the hiſtory of the <hi>Graſſes</hi> and <hi>Grain</hi> annexed; a work which, if executed by a proper hand, could not but be acceptable to all lovers of rural economy. This view might be rendered ſtill more complete, by extending it to <hi>all</hi> thoſe plants which are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the objects of this paper.</note>
                  <hi>Plantarum Oxonienſis</hi> are referred to. The columns on the other page contain the reſult of the experiments, for brevity's ſake expreſſed as in the original, by nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical characters, which it will be neceſſary to illuſtrate. There is a column retained for every
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0168400500:388"/>
ſpecies of animals with which the experiments were made in <hi>Sweden;</hi> for, although <hi>goats</hi> are not ſo commonly kept with us, as in that country, yet it will at leaſt be matter of entertainment, if not of utility, to ſee what choice of vegetables they will make.</p>
               <p>When this figure (1) is made uſe of, it denotes that the plant is eaten by that animal to which the column is appropriated; <hi>(O.)</hi> horned cattle or <hi>Oxen; (G.) Goats; (Sh.) Sheep; (H.) Horſes; (S.) Swine.</hi> Two units, thus (11) denote that the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is very fond of the plant. When the cypher (0) occurs, we are to underſtand that the plant is rejected by that animal. When both are found together in a column, thus (10), or (01), they denote that it was ſometimes eaten and ſometimes rejected: the former is ſuppoſed to ſignify, that it was generally eaten, but ſometimes refuſed; the latter, the reverſe. Where no figure occurs, it is to be underſtood that no opportunity had been taken of making a trial of that plant upon thoſe animals. The native place of each plant is added, and the month in which it flowers, in as compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a manner as poſſible, as this ſeemed to be a requiſite addition; alſo its duration, whether an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>(A.),</hi> biennial <hi>(B.),</hi> or perennial <hi>(P.).</hi> To the whole are collected and ſubjoined, from the laſt edition of the <hi>Flora Suecica,</hi> the <hi>Flora Oeconomica,</hi> RAY'S <hi>Hiſtoria Plantarum,</hi> HALLER'S <hi>Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae,</hi> and others, a few notes, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out particularly the noxious plants, or directing the reader's obſervation to any other article that ſeemed worthy of regard.</p>

LINNAEUS, in the <hi>Flora Lapponica,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 103, gives a dreadful account of the havock it frequently made among the horned cattle in <hi>Lapland,</hi> where it is common in the meadows near the ſea, and where theſe cattle will frequently eat it, upon being firſt turned to graſs in the ſpring, though they afterwards refuſe it: yet they will eat the roots at all times, which are the moſt virulent parts of the plant. Biſhop <hi>Gunner</hi> and <hi>Gmelin</hi> both confirm theſe bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. It is yet doubtful whether horſes are hurt by it; and certain that goats are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with it, and eat it without any ſubſequent ill effect: and the roots are collected by the <hi>Norwegian</hi> peaſants as fodder for thoſe animals.</note>

                              <hi>Herb Robert.</hi> This plant is in great reputation with ſome farmers, on account of its prevailing virtues againſt ſtaling of blood, and the bloody flux in cattle: in which caſes it is ſaid to be the beſt among a great variety of means commonly uſed upon ſuch occaſions.</p>

                              <hi>Diadelphous Plants.</hi> A general view of this claſs ſhews at once how very acceptable they are to almoſt all cattle. Cows and ſheep refuſed none, and horſes not more than three out of the whole number with which they were tried. They afford the richeſt food for cattle, and are cultivated in divers parts of <hi>Europe</hi> with all poſſible attention. With us the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Purple Tref il,</hi> or Clover, is moſtly ſown.
