            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>GEORGE.</head>
               <p>LITTLE George was fond of walking in a wood that bordered on his father's ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en: Now this wood was formed of little trees, placed very near each other, and two paths conducting through it, croſſed. One day, as he was ſauntering up and down, he wiſhed to reſt himſelf a little, with his back ſupported by a tree, whoſe ſtem was yet quite ſlender, and which therefore ſhook through all its branches, when his body firſt touched it. As it chanced, the ruſtling frighted a poor little bird, which flew out of a neighbouring buſh, and ſoon diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
               <p>George ſaw it fly away, and was vexed. He fixed his eye upon the buſh, to ſee if it would not return: and while he was attentively conſidering it, he thought he ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the branches, at a ſpot where they were twiſted into one another, ſomething like a tuft of hay. His curioſity induced him to draw nearer and examine it. He found this tuft of hay was hollow like a porringer: he thruſt aſide the branches, and ſaw certain little balls within it, of an oval ſhape, and ſpotted. They were placed beſide each other, on a layer of graſs. Sure this, ſaid George, muſt be what I have heard ſome people call a bird's neſt; and the balls are eggs. They are indeed quite little, but the bird is not ſo big as any of our hens.</p>
               <p>It was his firſt deſign to carry away the neſt; however, upon ſecond thoughts, he was contented with one egg; and having taken it, ran home. He met his ſiſter by the way, and thus addreſſed her: "See this little egg. I found it in a neſt: there were five others with it." "Let me have it in my hand;" ſaid George's ſiſter. She exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it, returns it to her brother, and then aſks a ſecond time to have it. In the end, they roll it up and down a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0360400704:6"/>table, juſt as if it were a ball. One ſhoves it one way, and the other puſhes it another way, till, in the midſt of their diverſion, it falls down and breaks. They cry, and mutually accuſe each other as the cauſe of ſuch a great misfortune.</p>
               <p>As it chanced, their mother hears them thus complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and not knowing why they weep, approaches to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e them. Both begin at once. She hears their different ſtories, and then taking each affectionately by the hand, conducts them to a tree that overſhadowed a green bank, on which ſhe bids them both ſit down.</p>
               <p>Be comforted, dear children, ſaid ſhe. That you have broke the egg between you both, is truly a misfortune; but it is one, however, that ſhould not much grieve you, ſince you did not mean to do ſo. I might notwithſtanding blame you, George, with juſtice, for the act of having brought it from the neſt. You muſt have ſeen hen's eggs diſpoſed of in a ſort of neſt. The mother ſits on, warms and animates them. Chickens in about three weeks are formed within them, and they pierce the ſhell. In ſome ſew days, they come and feed out of your hand. This egg would alſo have become a ſort of chick, which you have killed by bringing it away. The bird that flew out of the buſh as you inform me, was the mother. Doubtleſs ſhe will come again, and very ſhortly, to her neſt: ſhe will perceive that one egg is wanting, and perhaps forſake it altogether. This is frequently the caſe.</p>
               <p>Perhaps this loſs of but a ſingle egg, informs them that their aſylum is diſcovered; they have every thing to fear from our violence; they gueſs that when their little ones are hatched, he who has already robbed them, will return and ſeize upon their tender family. If then this neſt which you have been thus robbing, as I muſt call it, ſhould be totally abandoned,—tell me, would you not be ſorry for it?</p>
               <p>Yes, mama, indeed, replied little George; and I am ſorry that I meddled with the egg; but then I did not know a ſyllable of what you have been telling us; and thought no harm in bringing it to ſhew my ſiſter, which is all that I meant to do.</p>
               <p>My little fellow, I can eaſily believe you, ſaid the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Should you do bad actions for the pleaſure which ſome ſuppoſe there is in doing them, you would in that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0360400704:7"/>caſe have a very wicked heart, and I ſhould be quite ſorry that I had ſuch a ſon: but that I do not fear; for, on the contrary, I know you to be a very good boy.</p>
               <p>Mama, ſaid the little girl, the neſt, for I have ſeen it, out of which my brother took this egg, does not reſemble in the leaſt thoſe ſwallows neſts that we ſee about our out-houſe roof. My dear child, ſaid the mother, every neſt is not alike; nor yet is every bird alike; for ſome are great, and others little. Some are never known to perch on trees, and others live at all times in them. Some are large and ſtupid, others ſmall and full of induſtry and cunning. Some are beautiful beyond deſcription in their plumage, which has half a dozen colours; others are of one dull colour. Some ſubſiſt on fruits, ſome go in queſt of inſects, and a multitude of others ſeize on ſmaller birds, and eat them.</p>
               <p>Ah the wicked creatures! cried the little girl. I do not love theſe laſt, and ſhould be glad to ſpoil their neſts. So too would many others, ſaid her mama; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe great birds that conſtantly devour the leſs, conſtruct their neſts in places where they cannot eaſily be come at; as for inſtance in woods, and in the holes of rocks, where men appear but very ſeldom; and at heights beyond our reach, however ſkilful we may be in climbing.</p>
               <p>Therefore, deareſt children, ſince theſe birds are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from each other, not only in ſize, but alſo in their way of life, and in the colour of their feathers, it is but reaſonable that they ſhould have neſts different alſo from each other. Thus the lark which never lives in any tree, but ſings, as you have heard her, mounting in the air; conſtructs her neſt upon the ground; the ſwallow builds about the roofs of houſes, under what we call the eaves; the owl, which people only hear by night, ſeeks out old ruinous buildings, or ſome hollow tree to put her eggs in; and the eagle which I ſhewed you yeſterday flying above the clouds and nearly out of ſight, brings forth her young ones in the cliffs of craggy rocks. Thoſe living round about us, make their neſts in trees and hedges. Thoſe that love the water, and who find their food therein, build theirs among thoſe ruſhes that grow
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0360400704:8"/>near it, upon little iſlands, and at times upon the ſhore itſelf.</p>
               <p>If one of theſe fine days we go into the little valley at the bottom of our large meadow, we ſhall ſee a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe little creatures buſy in ſelecting the materials they compoſe their neſts of. One you will obſerve em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in carrying off a wheaten ſtraw; another will have in his beak ſome wool or feathers; or dried leaves; and very probably a third ſome moſs. The ſwallow, by the border of a ſtream, you will take notice, moiſtens with the water which he takes up in his beak, a little bit of earth with which he builds his habitation. Such materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als as are very coarſe and ſolid, he will take to form the outſide of his neſt, but lines it with the ſofteſt and the warmeſt. Nay, there are ſome birds who pull out their own feathers to make up a more comfortable bed for their little ones.</p>
               <p>They conſtruct large neſts, or ſmall ones, in proportion to the number of young birds that they are to hatch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them. Some will hang their neſts up by a ſort of thread, which thread they have the ſkill to form of flax, of different ſorts of weeds, and of the webs of ſpiders. Others place it in the middle of a ſoft and gluey ſubſtance, whereunto they carefully ſtick many feathers. All do every thing in their power to make it ſtrong and ſolid, and ſecure themſelves from every enemy that Inſtinct bids them fear, by reſorting to retired and ſolitary places.</p>
               <p>There they lay their eggs. The mother, and at times the father, ſits upon them in the neſt, with admirable perſeverance. They are taught by nature, that the warmth proceeding from their body, when they ſit upon theſe eggs, puts every thing within them into motion, and produces little creatures, which at laſt are ſtrong enough to break the ſhell that holds them, and come forth.</p>
               <p>You muſt have often ſeen a fly in winter, to appearance dead. You took it in your hands, and through the warm h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> proceeding from them, it was brought to life. It is nearly thus with birds: the perſeverance of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when they brood upon their eggs, converts them into living creatures.</p>
               <p>When the mother ſits alone, the cock will bring her victuals, and ſit by to pleaſe her with his muſic. When the little ones are once alive, they help them to get clear
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0360400704:9"/>of their confinement in the egg. Their diligence is now redoubled; they do every thing to nouriſh and defend them, and are conſtantly employed in this intereſting office. They go very far indeed to get their food, and make an equal diſtribution of it, every one receiving in its turn what they have brought. As long as they are very young and helpleſs, they contrive to bring them vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals ſuited to their delicacy; but when once they are grown ſtrong and older, they provide them food more ſolid.</p>
               <p>There is one, and that a very large one, called a <hi>peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> who being forced to go great diſtances in queſt of victuals for her young ones, is provided with a ſort of bag. She fills it with ſuch aliments as ſhe is ſenſible they love: ſhe warms what ſhe procures, and renders it by ſuch means fitter for their tender ſtomachs: ſhe returns, and empties it before them.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of being parents, they appear as if forgetting that they want food themſelves, and only think upon their little family. If either rain or tempeſts come, they hurry to their neſts, and cover it as well as they are able with their outſtretched wings, ſo keeping out the wind and water that might hurt the brood. All night too, they are buſy in the work of cheriſhing the little things. The fearfulleſt among them, that will fly away if they but hear the ſlighteſt noiſe, and tremble at the leaſt degree of danger, know not what fear is when they have once a family to protect, but become courageous and intrepid: as for inſtance, the common hen. As great a coward as ſhe is when by herſelf, ſhe grows a very heroine, a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of courage, when ſhe has young ones to defend from danger. She attacks the greateſt dog, and will not even fear a man, who ſhould attempt to take them from her.</p>
               <p>So too do the little birds endeavour to defend their young, when any one would ſteal or hurt them. They will flutter round the neſt, will ſeem to call out for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, will attack the invader, and purſue him. If their young be ſhut within a cage, they will continue to come regularly, and at all times feed them. Frequently the mother will prefer confinement with them, rather than be freed from the neceſſity of tending on them, and will never quit the little creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0360400704:10"/>Poor dear birds! cried out the children, how we ſhall love you for the future! We will never be ſo cruel as to do you any harm. We will only look at your neſts; and be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gaze on you, while employed in the delightful taſk of tending on your young, and to contemplate your little family, all flying round their parents.—Yes, dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſaid the mother, thus it ſhould be. Keep your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution as you ought, and I ſhall love you for it. Never injure any creature, or occaſion it the leaſt degree of pain for pleaſure's ſake: on ſaying which, the mother went in doors, embracing her dear children, who were highly pleaſed with what they had juſt learnt.</p>

               <head>JAMES.</head>
               <p>A Merchant whom we ſhall here call James, had but a ſingle ſon, whom he loved very tenderly. He was far from having a bad heart, his countenance was rather pretty, and his friends would all have been very fond of him, but that he ſhewed in every action, a covetous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity which ſhocked as many as had opportunities of knowing him. This covetouſneſs made him violently wiſh for every thing poſſeſſed by others. It even wrought upon him to ſo great a pitch, that he would conſtantly refuſe to ſhare among his play-mates, or even ſhew them what he had himſelf. His father, who poſſeſſed a very amiable character, wiſhed greatly to reform him of this fault, but never had been able. All that he could do, was to ſhew how much it grieved him.</p>
               <p>Little James, however, loſt a great deal more by his propenſity to avarice, than he had ever gained thereby. Did any body give him ſweetmeats? He would get away and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>allow them like a churl, in ſome dark corner of the houſe, for fear leſt any one ſhould aſk a part. Whilſt he was hid, his father would give twice as much to his companions: he perceived it, and no longer hid himſelf: but as ſoon as he fixed his eye on ſweetmeats, or nice things, he appeared as if he would devour them:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0360400704:11"/>he purſued the hands of thoſe who held them, and his own were in a ſort of convulſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. James, as we have ſaid before, was very much afflicted in perceiving this; and that he might not be afflicted further than was abſolutely neceſſary, he ceaſed to give him any more nice things, or even have them in the houſe.</p>
               <p>Had little James a wind-mill, boat, or other play-thing, he would never ſhew it: he concealed himſelf in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it, and was never happy. Or, ſuppoſing he had any ſort of fruit, he would not ſhare it with his play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, but devour it all alone, refuſing even thoſe whom he happened to love moſt, and ſuch as might be hungry; therefore none among his play mates would in turn ſhare any thing with him: they were indeed beſt pleaſed to leave his company; they never wiſhed to have it. When he chanced to be in a quarrel, no one took his part, not even when they knew him in the right; but being in the wrong, all joined againſt him.</p>
               <p>As it chanced, one day a little boy obſerved him with an apple in his hand, and gave him by ſurprize a knock upon the elbow, ſo that he was forced to let the apple go. He picked it up, however; but that moment, to avenge himſelf upon the boy that had contrived to play him ſuch a trick, he ſet off to catch him, but in running fell into a ſlough, and was almoſt ſuffocated in the mud. He did his utmoſt to get out, but could not: he attempted, but without ſucceeding, to prevail upon his playmates to hold out their hands and help him; he obſerved that they only laughed at his diſtreſs, and, in deriſion, danced about the ſlough, from which he could not extricate himſelf. Their cry was, "Let <hi>him</hi> now hold out a hand to whom you have been generous! Aſk aſſiſtance of thoſe whom you have obliged!" However at length, one, more compaſſionate, came forward, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where he ſtood, ſtretched forth his hand, and got him out in ſafety.—He ſhook off the mud that covered him, and then, to ſhew his gratitude to that good little boy who had delivered him, bit off about a quarter from the apple which had cauſed this ſad diſaſter, and which ſtill he held faſt in his hand, and would fain have made him take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0360400704:12"/>The good little boy, diſguſted with the gift, and way of giving, took the morſel, but to fling it in his face; and this was, as it were, a ſignal for the reſt to ſcout him. They purſued our little James quite home, and hallooed all the way.</p>
               <p>He was not void of feeling, and had never yet been hooted: he was therefore thrown into a thinking humour, and did not afterwards come much into his father's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but confined himſelf to his apartment for above ten days together. There he aſked himſelf, what cauſe his play-mates had to hate him. He addreſſed himſelf as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: "For what reaſon has my little neighbour, he that even held me out his hand when I was in the mire, ſuch a number of good friends? Why is he loved ſo much, while I have not a ſingle little boy that will ſeek my company, nor be my friend, nor conſole me in affliction?"—He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered very ſoon the reaſon, by comparing the good boy's behaviour with his own. He recollected that he was happy to do any one a pleaſure; that whenever he had any fruit, confectionary, or the like, he felt more joy in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ring it with his companion, than in eating it himſelf, and had no ſort of amuſement which he did not wiſh all his little acquaintances to ſhare. He ſaw plainly, on this view of things, how much he differed from this little boy in diſpoſition. He reſolved at laſt to imitate him, and went out next day with both his pockets full of fruit, ran up to every boy that he met, and gave him ſome: he could not all at once, however, give up <hi>ſelf,</hi> but left a little in his pocket, which he eat in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate when got home.</p>
               <p>Although his liberality was not perfect, he found occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be ſatisfied with the effect of it, ſince his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions now, on their part, were more generous to him; they ſhewed themſelves more merry in his company; they took him as a partner in their little paſtimes, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with him what they had, and he went home quite pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Upon the morrow he did ſtill a great deal better. When he met his little friends, he did not fail to pull out of his pocket every thing that he had, divided it into as many ſhares as there were mouths to eat it, and reſerved a ſhare no more than equal for himſelf. Indeed, if there was any
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0360400704:13"/>difference, ſome thought that he took the leaſt, and he was much more ſatisfied that day than the preceding.</p>
               <p>By degrees he was habituated to be generous, and even to ſuch as he could ſee had nothing in return to give: I mean to ſuch as were in want. Of courſe he grew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: whenever his companions ſaw him, they ran up to meet him with the greateſt joy upon their countenances; they were glad to give him pleaſure. In ſhort, he was now quite happy.</p>
               <p>Such a change could not eſcape his father's obſervation, and it gave him real ſatisfaction. He affectionately took him in his arms, refuſed him nothing for the time to come, and even ſought occaſions to delight him. Every day little James diſcerned, that to be happy, it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that he ſhould not deſire a ſolitary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but wiſh to make thoſe round about him happy likewiſe.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>No, indeed: but let us ſpeak in this place for your brother and you only; and obſerve what would reſult from your being bigger. In the firſt place then, Frederic, if, as you wiſhed juſt now, you were as tall as that ſame cherry-tree, how would you be able, as at preſent, to go out and take your walk among ſo many trees, as fill our orchard? You would be obliged to crawl upon all fours, and even ſo, you would find it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to get along.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>But you forget, papa, how eaſily I might put out my foot againſt the firſt tree ſtanding in my way, and root it up. It would be nothing but a wheat-ſtalk to me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>Thereby you would purſue a very prudent plan! ſo, in proportion as you wanted much more fruit to ſatisfy your palate, you would deſtroy the trees that bear it; but let us go a little farther than an orchard. There are many roads about us, upon one ſide ſhaded by a row of trees, whoſe branches overhang the path-way. Men that are of common heights can walk beneath thoſe branches at their eaſe, and find the ſhade which they give quite comfortable in the ſcorching heat of ſummer, and particularly at noon-day; but you would be obliged to walk along the middle of the road, and have no ſhade. And then, what would become of you, when you were to make your way through any foreſt? What a furious over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of trees you would make before you could clear yourſelf a path!</p>

                  <p>In that caſe, let us come back to your idea. If, in nature, every thing were to become bigger, ſtill preſerving its preſent proportion, you would be exactly at the point whence you firſt of all ſet out. You would not then be capable of frighting people in their garrets, by juſt looking at them through the window; you would find it no leſs difficult to wade acroſs the water, or drive piles without aſſiſtance, than at preſent; and be equally unable to twiſt off, as you expreſſed it, a bull's neck, or ſend him up two hundred yards into the air: he would be ſtill much bigger than yourſelf.</p>

                  <p>Excellently well conceived! And thus, though you ſhould grow as large in ſtature as our cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree; our cherry-tree, in turn, would have grown larger alſo, by the difference now between you.</p>

                  <p>Why, truly, there might be ſome ſavings!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marcus.</speaker>
                  <p>And beſides, we ſhould not then have cauſe to go to war with one another, as a place no bigger than our garden, would be large enough to build a mighty city. Men therefore, having much more room than they want,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0360400704:21"/>would never go to war with one another (as I have heard you ſay that they do) to obtain an inch or two of land.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>I would not anſwer for them in that point, acquainted as I am with human folly: but I will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb ſo charming an arrangement by my fears; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am contented to ſuppoſe that I ſee both peace and plenty flouriſhing among us, and the golden age, thanks to your good management, brought back again among us!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marcus.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! that is not all. My tutor tells me, little creatures are a deal more delicate and perfect in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than great ones; have a much more piercing ſight, a finer ſenſe of hearing; and in ſmell are much ſuperior. Is that true, papa?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>In general.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marcus.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus then were we leſs by a great deal than at preſent, we ſhould ſee, and hear, and ſmell many things, of which, at preſent, we have no knowledge.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe advantages, it is true, are very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; yet I own, I ſhould be ſorry to renounce, for ſuch advantages, the univerſal empire which we now exerciſe on every thing that breathes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marcus.</speaker>
                  <p>There would be no occaſion to renounce it; for remember, you have often told me, that man bears rule much more by his underſtanding, than mere ſtrength of body.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>True; becauſe his ſtrength of body is exactly proportioned to his underſtanding. But beſtow upon a Lilliputian's frame the greateſt and ſublimeſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; give him even our inventions, and our arts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to that perfection which they poſſeſs among us; do you think that he would be able to employ our ſlighteſt inſtruments, and manage properly the meaneſt of our numberleſs machines or engines? How would he defend himſelf againſt wild beaſts, when even the dog that he keeps within his dwelling, would, without deſigning any miſchief, cruſh him under foot?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marcus.</speaker>
                  <p>But then, if every thing becomes proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably little? There, I think, I have you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>Only to confound yourſelf; for granting this proportionality of littleneſs, and men immediately loſe all the advantage that you would give them. Their deficient harveſts would not keep them from the fear of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0360400704:22"/>famine, and their wars, while they were no leſs frequent or ferocious than at preſent, would be more ridiculous. The inferior animals would ſtill have finer organs, and more delicate ſenſations; and perhaps too, with his littleneſs, which could not but be laughed at, he would take upon him, as you do, to alter and reform the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marcus.</speaker>
                  <p>I think, papa, you are much too hard upon me; one can ſettle nothing with you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>For this reaſon, brother; becauſe you know nothing about the matter. There is but one way to order things as they ſhould be.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>Bravo!—ſo you take the man of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence upon you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, as well as Marcus.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>Come, then, let me know how you would ſettle the affair? your ſyſtem muſt be very curious, I ſuppoſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then, papa, we only want one thing; we only want to have a harder body, one as hard as iron.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>And why ſo?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſee where I have pricked my finger. It ſeems nothing: yet you cannot imagine how much pain it gives me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>My poor little man! I am ſorry for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>And the wound that I received in my head about a month ago, by tumbling, as you remember, down ſtairs. It was but cured a week ago: feel here, papa:—there; that is the place.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>I feel the ſear indeed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>What pleaſure it would be to play with Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, and not fear his biting me. And beſides, when I were old enough to be a ſoldier, and go fight, I ſhould, in that caſe, laugh at balls and bullets. Nay, my head would blunt the broadeſt ſword that ſtruck it: would not that be vaſtly pretty?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>That it would indeed!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>In that caſe we ſhould want for nothing: we ſhould be quite perfect; ſhould we not, papa?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton, </speaker>

                  <p>Oh, how fine! It muſt be very good to eat. Do you deſign to give it me, for having ſettled matters better than my brother?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>No: it is not for you.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>Nor for you. I mean it for a certain—I do not know if I ſhould ſay, a certain perſon; but however that be—one more perfect than you are.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marcus.</speaker>
                  <p>And who is that, papa?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>You will wonder, very likely, when I tell you:—that negro figure on my mantle-piece.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>You joke, papa! why he can neither ſee, nor eat, nor ſmell.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>And yet he is made of iron.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes: and for that very reaſon he cannot.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>What then, you would have ſacrificed the ſatisfaction of ſeeing, eating, and ſmelling, to the boaſt that you could never break your head by falling from my mantle-piece? for were you made of iron, as you wiſhed, you would be only fit to ſtand there with my other bronzes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, I do not mean ſo, papa; I would be living while I had this iron body.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>And how then could it be animated by that blood, and by thoſe juices that keep up our life? By what means could its nerves be flexible, and have that ſenſibility which makes us ſo expert or ready in the uſe of every limb, and readers the enjoyment of our ſenſes ſo delightful?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, dear me! this is ſad work! I ſee my ſcheme is hardly better than my brother's.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marcus.</speaker>
                  <p>But, papa, ſince you are ſo clever in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our plans thus, it is your turn to provide us with a better in their ſtead.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Linton.</speaker>
                  <p>And why ſhould I provide one? I am mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly ſatisfied with that which God's providence has already eſtabliſhed. Yes, dear children, I am ſenſible, we are completely furniſhed with whatever can promote our happineſs; ſuperior in our conformation to all other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, we tame, by virtue of our genius, the ſmall number of thoſe which in ſtrength ſurpaſs us. If we have not the rapidity of ſtags and horſes, we can make that compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which will overtake the one while he is running from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0360400704:24"/>us, and can mount the other to direct him whither we think proper. We have not the wings of a bird, yet we can give wings to thoſe tall trees that grow in ſcreſts, and can make them carry us to the remoteſt diſtances. Our ſight, leſs piercing than an inſect's, is not bounded to the narrow ſpace in which we move about, but can take in an ample horizon, and contemplate the great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of nature. We are unable to gaze, like an eagle, at the ſun; but we invent an inſtrument which ſeems to draw us nearer to that luminary, ſo that we may meaſure his immenſity of diſtance, and obſerve the place which he poſſeſſes in the midſt of an infinity of ſtars that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by his ſuperior brightneſs. Every other ſenſe that we have, contributes likewiſe to procure us a ſucceſſion of enjoyments, and effect our ſafety. Conſcious of our genius, we are every day in ſearch of new diſcoveries; we diſarm the thunder, or elſe tell it where to fall; we make one element reſiſt another; we oppoſe the beneficial warmth of fire to the inclemency of froſt; and keep the land from being overflowed by inundations. Sometimes we deſcend into the darkeſt bowels of the earth, and bring out thence thoſe precious metals which are purified, and then, by an ingenious mode of mixing them together, form new ſubſtances; and ſometimes we mark out thoſe rocks which hang juſt ready, as it were, to fall upon our heads, precipitate them from their height into the vallies, and ſoon after make them re-aſcend in ſumptuous edifices, or in ſtately pyramids that hide their ſummits in the clouds. The ſociety that we form with our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for the ſatisfaction of our mutual wants, obtains us, in return for our own toil, the labour of ten thouſand hands, all eager to procure us the conveniencies of life. Upon whatever ſide we turn, we have at our command the various productions of the univerſe, all brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our uſe. The ſciences exalt our ſouls, and charm our faculties. The arts, by having introduced ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs machines, aſſiſt us in our labour, or refreſh us when we ſeek repoſe. Both memory and reflection give us the advantages enjoyed by all thoſe who have preceded us. Together with the pleaſing idea of our own perſonal exiſtence, we derive happineſs from others alſo, by the virtues of compaſſion and beneficence, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions of kindred and of friendſhip. Nevertheleſs, our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0360400704:25"/>happineſs depends upon ourſelves alone, amid the hoſt of creatures that ſurround us, being ſure of obtaining it, if we but moderately uſe our ſtrength, and make a conſtant application of our reaſon to the buſineſs of determining our conduct; ſo that, if we ever interrupt our happineſs by going further than we ſhould do, we have nothing to blame, in that caſe, but our own folly. We then ſeem children as you are, who, inſtead of gratefully enjoying the conveniencies and comforts of our ſituation, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly enduring its few evils, vex ourſelves with wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ideal bleſſings, or diſgrace our nature by a lack of manly courage.</p>

                     <p>We ſhall ſee which of them will be moſt entitled to my love. You cannot but remember, how I promiſed at their father's death to look upon them as my own. I will perform this ſacred duty. As I cannot tell how long I have to live, I am come to ſee theſe children, and to know their different characters; which I deſign to ſtudy, ſo that I may regulate accordingly the final diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of my fortune in their favour.</p>

                     <p>What you call beneficence, dear lady, in me, is no more than duty. Your eſteemed and worthy father truſted to my care the education of his ſon, your brother; and this brother, anxious for his tutor's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, preſented me the living that I poſſeſs.

                     <p>I am very glad to find that you can diſcern yourſelf theſe faults within you. To acknowledge that we do wrong, is ſomething akin to doing well. What think you, Leonora?</p>

                     <p>She ſhould know indeed, and be the firſt to notice them; but affection too often blinds us, ſo that we can ſee no faults in thoſe that we love.—I do not mean to vex you, ſaying this, believe me.</p>

                     <speaker>Leonora.</speaker>

                     <p>On the contrary, they are briſker far than you, becauſe they go to bed at ten every night.</p>

                     <p>At ten; that they may get up early in the morning. When you are faſt aſleep in bed, they have received their leſſons in geography and cyphering. When the clock ſtrikes ten, they take their needle-work in hand till noon; and then aſſiſt their mother in the houſe.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Leonora.</speaker>

                     <p>She may hope, by means of ſuch an education, to procure them ſomething better. But, however that be, ſhould they not be taught to govern ſervants, regulate a table, and conduct their houſe?</p>

                     <p>Why not buſy? They have then their harpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord, or writing; and at night, aſſemble round a table, where they read by turns in the Spectator, or Miſs Moore's laſt publication, <hi>Sacred Dramas;</hi> while the two that are not occupied upon their book; employ themſelves in mending their own clothes, or examining the linen of the houſe, and mending it, if needful.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Leonora.</speaker>
                     <p>So then they never take any recreation?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>David.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh! I beg your pardon! They amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as if they were three queens; for all theſe taſks are intermixed with little ſports, and pleaſant converſation. They pay viſits alſo, and receive them; but take care to have their work-bags, and I never ſaw them idle for a minute.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Leonora.</speaker>
                     <p>This is certainly what Mr. Vincent meant. And yet my aunt has often told me, that ſuch an educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as, according to your account, the Miſs Sharps receive, is only fit for tradeſmen's children.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>David.</speaker>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing them to be tradeſmen's children, would they find this education uſeleſs to them? They ſhould certainly know houſhold work, or how will they be able to direct a ſervant? If they know nothing of it, every one will join to cheat them; and the richer they

                     <p>I proteſt you fright me! I know nothing of the work about a houſe! ſcarce how to hold a needle! Yet I have juſt been told, that we have nothing in the world, except what Mr. Vincent's bounty gives us.</p>

                     <speaker>Leonora.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh no; ſhe told me to the contrary ſcarce half an hour ago. She has no more than is ſufficient for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. In caſe then any accident ſhould happen with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Mr. Vincent, what would be our ſate?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>David.</speaker>
                     <p>I ſhould be at firſt put to difficulties; but my maſter tells me that I ſhould truſt in God, and hope that he never would forſake me. His opinion is, that there are always generous people in the world, whoſe friendſhip may be gained by an exertion of one's ſkill to ſerve them in the way of ſome profeſſion, and who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently create employment for the induſtrious. Thus then, in the courſe of ſome few years, when I am more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in learning, I might undertake to teach ſuch children as know leſs than I do. I ſhould even improve myſelf by ſuch an occupation, and with good behaviour on my part, be ſure of living with ſome ſort of eaſe and comfort, and perhaps ſtrike out a way to fortune.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Leonora.</speaker>
                     <p>But what benefit could I derive from all my ſkill in dancing, or in drawing, or in muſic? I ſhould die perhaps of hunger, notwithſtanding all theſe vain accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>David.</speaker>
                     <p>And therefore Mr. Vincent cannot be well pleaſed when he diſcovers that you have been put to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thoſe arts which ſerve for ornament or pleaſure.</p>

                     <p>And vexation ſometimes, David; for when I dance, or ſing in company, if I am not praiſed as much as I ſuppoſe myſelf to merit, you cannot think how much I am fretted at the diſappointment!—Shall I alſo tell you that I am often tired of thoſe fine matters, which my aunt ſays ſerve us to paſs time away with ſatisfaction.</p>

                     <p>Truſt me, notwithſtanding your oeconomy, if you continue ignorant, it will not. And beſides, when you are come of age, what prudent man will take a woman who poſſeſſes no one talent conducive to his happineſs? It is plain, then, nothing but the fortune that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0360400704:47"/>you poſſeſs will render you an eligible wife; and this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſhews ſtill ſtronger the neceſſity of ſecuring a fortune to you after my death.</p>

                     <p>Generous little fellow! do not be uneaſy; Leonora has received a pair of diamond ear-rings, worth ten watches ſuch as yours.</p>

                     <speaker>David.</speaker>
                     <p>So I likewiſe fear, ſir; my dear aunt imagines that a little drawing, dancing, ſinging, and the like, are all that ſhe wants to be happy in the world.</p>

                     <p>To theſe frivolous embelliſhments then ſhe ſacrifices the much more important cultivation of her underſtanding; and forbears inſpiring her with thoſe good qualities which have alone a claim on human approbation. As your ſiſter's reaſon has been ſo neglected, ſhe is pleaſed with thoſe applauſes that are offered on the altar of her vanity. But when, in ſome few years, ſhe ſees how many uſeful matters of inſtruction, and how much ineſtimable time ſhe has for ever loſt, ſhe will inevitably bluſh at her own conduct, and even execrate her flatterers; who, on their ſide, will repay her hatred with their ridicule and ſcorn.</p>

                     <p>I would with all my heart; but at her age, can one expect that ſhe will ſubmit to any rigid treatment, after the indulgence that ſhe has received at home?

                     <p>I am ſenſible of your affection; but the fear of death will not delay the fatal moment of its coming. Leonora's future lot gives me pain, whenever I reflect on what it may be; and in ſhort, I am reſolved to give her my whole fortune, that at leaſt ſhe may have wherewithal to keep herſelf from want.</p>

                     <p>Oh thank you ten times over! How rejoiced I am, ſir! Shall I leave you for a moment, and go tell her this good news? But no; it will be better to conceal it from her, or at leaſt till ſhe has been induced to get ſome uſeful knowledge, from a notion that ſhe muſt live, in future, by her induſtry. She will, by that means, know much better how to manage what you give her. O my deareſt Leonora! after all, then, I may hope to ſee you happy.</p>

                     <p>Worthy little fellow! I am no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with your generoſity, than underſtanding. Come to my arms my dear child! Could I intend to give your ſiſter every thing, and leave you nothing? That were to the laſt degree unjuſt: and therefore I revoke my firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.

                     <p>No, no, dear ſir, preſerve your firſt intention, and give Leonora all your fortune. I ſhall be much more diligent in my improvement, and more anxious to acquire uſeful knowledge which, I doubt not, with God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, will ſuffice for my advancement.</p>

                     <p>No, dear Leonora, that would be wrong again. On the contrary, you ought to cultivate them; for, in truth, they are deſirable accompliſhments. Only remember that they do not conſtitute all the merit that is required in a woman. They may render her more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in good company; be a relaxation to her after the cares attendant on a houſe and family, and make her ſtill more fond of living in retirement: add another tie to the attachment of her huſband, guide her in the choice of maſters for her children, and enable her to further their improvement. They are only prejudicial when they feed her vanity, and make her give into a fatal diſſipation, or contempt of duties in that ſtate of life to which God's providence has called her. They are flowers, in ſhort, that may poſſeſs ſome little portion of one's garden, if the reſt be ſet apart for fruits and vegetables.</p>

               <p>MORGAN, though a plain companion, was a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial workman. He aſpired at nothing in his heart ſo much as to become a maſter; but he wanted money to ſet up.</p>
               <p>A merchant, who was well acquainted with his induſtry, was willing to ſupply him with an hundred pounds, that he might open ſhop.</p>
               <p>One may, without much difficulty, gueſs at Morgan's joy. In his imagination, he already had a warehouſe full of goods. He reckoned up how many cuſtomers would crowd to buy them, and what money he ſhould have at balancing his books.</p>
               <p>Amidſt the extravagant emotions of that tranſport into which theſe notions threw him, he perceived an ale-houſe. Come, ſaid he, and entered it, I will have a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with one ſixpence of this money.</p>
               <p>He demurred, however, ſome few moments, to call out for punch which was his favourite liquor, as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience loudly told him that the moment of enjoyment was not yet arrived; that he was, firſt of all, to think of paying what his friend had lent him; and at preſent that it was not honeſt for him to lay out a penny of the ſum for things not abſolutely neceſſary. He was ready to come out again, impreſſed by ſuch right notions, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf, on the other hand, that if he ſpent a ſixpence of his money, he ſhould ſtill have ninety-nine pounds nineteen ſhillings and a ſixpence left; that ſuch a ſum was full enough to ſet him up in trade, and that a ſingle half-hour's induſtry would compenſate for ſuch a trifling pleaſure as he wiſhed to have at preſent.</p>
               <p>It was thus, that taking up the glaſs, he ſought to quiet his interior ſcruples; but alas, his preſent conduct was to open him a door to ruin.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, ſo agreeable a recollection of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at the ale-houſe filled his mind, that he was now leſs ſcrupulous with conſcience in expentling one more ſixpence at it. He had ninety-nine pounds nineteen ſhillings ſtill remaining.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0360400704:54"/>On the following days, the love of liquor had beſotted him in ſuch a manner, that he conſtantly returned to his beloved ale-houſe, but increaſed the quantum of his liquor, to a ſhilling's worth at firſt; then ſixpence more; and ſo on, till he came to half-a-crown; at which he ſeemed to make a ſtand, and every time, he could conſole himſelf with ſaying, It is but two-and-ſixpence that I am ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Oh, I need not fear but I ſhall have enough to carry on my trade.</p>
               <p>Such then was his deluſive way of reaſoning, in reply to what his conſcience whiſpered, which would now and then be heard. It did not ſtrike him, that his fortune was an even hundred pounds, and that the uſeful applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole depended on the fit employ to which he put its parts.</p>
               <p>You ſee then, my dear little friends, how by inſenſible gradation he at length plunged into a life of extravagance. He found no longer any joy in induſtry, employed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely as he was in contemplating on his preſent riches, which he fancied inexhauſtible; and yet, from day to day, he did not fail to find that it was diminiſhing. He was convinced, and his conviction all at once came over him juſt like a clap of thunder, that he could not make amends for his preceding diſſipation, as his benefactor would not be ſo fond of lending him another hundred pounds, when he had ſeen him ſo miſuſe the firſt.</p>
               <p>Quite overcome with ſhame and grief, the more he ſought to ſtifle his ideas with hard drinking, ſo much the ſooner by a great deal, did his ruin fall upon him. And at laſt the frightful moment came, when quite diſguſted at the thought of induſtry, and being, as it were, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of horror to himſelf, he regarded life as a burthen, ſince it preſented him with nothing but a proſpect of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable poverty whenever he looked forward.</p>
               <p>He renounced his country, followed by deſpair, and joined a gang of ſmugglers, formidable for the ravages which they ſpread through every country on the coaſt. But Heaven did not permit their violence to remain long unpuniſhed. A diſgraceful death ſoon ended his career of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Alas! if when his reaſon firſt of all addreſſed him, he had liſtened to the reproaches of his conſcience, eaſy in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0360400704:55"/>his ſituation he might now have been enjoying, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and honour, the eaſe of a reſpectable and opulent old age.</p>
               <p>You ſhudder, children, at his lamentable folly. Such is notwithſtanding that of multitudes among us, in the uſe which they make of life. It was beſtowed upon them that they might live happy in virtuous enjoyments, and yet they laviſh it upon every ſhameful diſſipation. They think that there will always be time enough left them, for the proper uſe thereof. However, in the interval, days, months, and years flow onward, and they find, at the concluſion of them, they have not made ſuch a uſe as they fondly propoſed. In ſome ſort, they are even happy if their conduct does not plunge them finally into deſpair.</p>

               <head>THE BLACKSMITH.</head>
               <p>A Gentleman of fortune paſſing very late one night before a blackſmith's habitation, was ſurprized to ſee him buſy at his forge, when every perſon in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood was gone to reſt. He had a curioſity to know what reaſon he could have for working thus at midnight, and if twelve hours labour in the day would not ſuffice him to provide ſubſiſtence for his family.</p>
               <p>I do not work for myſelf, replied the blackſmith, but for a neighbour here of mine, who has unfortunately been burnt out. I riſe two hours before the uſual time of labour every morning, and continue working two hours after at at leaſt, and ſometimes longer, as is now the caſe, and this I do, that I may help him in his deſtitute condition. If I had but any thing myſelf, I would divide it with him; but my all is nothing, except this ſhop, and ſome ſmall ſtock of metal, which I cannot ſell, becauſe it is what ſubſiſts me. Thus I work every day four hours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, which amounts to two days in the courſe of a week, and the earnings of thoſe two days I can yield to him. Thank heaven, at this time of the year there is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0360400704:56"/>work enough! and while I have but ſtrength, it is my duty to aſſiſt the unhappy.</p>
               <p>This is very generous, my good friend, on your part, ſaid the gentleman, as I ſuppoſe your neighbour never will be able to repay your kindneſs.</p>
               <p>Truly, ſir, I fear he will not: but I fear it on his account alone, not mine. However, I am ſure he would rejoice to do as much for me, were I in his condition.</p>
               <p>At theſe words, the gentleman, not wiſhing to intrude upon the blackſmith any longer, wiſhed him a good night, and went away.</p>
               <p>Upon the morrow, having put into his purſe a note for twenty pounds, which he could afford to give away, he went out, and meant to leave it with the blackſmith, whoſe beneficence he was reſolved to recompence, by putting it in his power to buy whatever metal he might want, at the cheapeſt market, to undertake more buſineſs, and to lay by a little from his labour, to ſupport him in old age.</p>
               <p>But what was his ſurprize, when the blackſmith bade him take his money back again! I cannot lay it out, ſaid he, becauſe I have not earned it. I can well afford to pay for all the iron that I uſe, and if ever I ſhould be in want of more, the merchant would ſupply me with it, on my note. It would be abſolute ingratitude in me to take that profit from him which he is uſed to make upon his goods, when he has never heſitated to ſupply me with as much as I could aſk, even when I had no other coat than that upon my back: but you may make a better uſe, ſir, of this money, if you lend it, free of intereſt, to my unhappy neighbour. He might then recover his affairs, and I ſleep out my belly full.</p>
               <p>The gentleman, with all his rhetoric, not being able to prevail upon the blackſmith to accept his offer, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the advice that he gave him; and was highly gratified in thinking that he had made two happy, when at firſt his generoſity had wiſhed to ſerve one only.</p>

               <head>THE GENEROUS ORPHAN.</head>
               <p>MRS. Fairborne had hardly loſt her huſband, when a law ſuit in which he had been engaged was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to her diſadvantage; the greateſt part of her poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions being dependent on the verdict. She was under the neceſſity of ſelling all her furniture, and ſome few jewels; after which, when ſhe had placed the produce at a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's, ſhe withdrew into a village, where the neceſſary things of life were not ſo high, and where ſhe apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe might live with tolerable decency upon her trifling income.</p>
               <p>Hardly had ſhe paſſed a month or two in her retreat, before ſhe was given to underſtand that her banker was gone off, and all her money with him. Let any one ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the horror of her ſituation. Grief and ſickneſs had long ſince diſabled her from doing any thing like labour for her livelihood; and after having paſſed her youth in eaſe and pleaſure, ſhe had no reſources left her in old age, except an alms-houſe, or the common refuge of the poor, beggary.</p>
               <p>In reality, there was not one of her acquaintance who would condeſcend to have the leaſt degree of intereſt in her ſufferings. Brought by her beloved huſband from a foreign country, ſhe had no one to whom ſhe could fly for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. None, except a tolerably near relation, whom ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had brought to England; and whom, by granting him her huſband's credit, ſhe had rendered wealthy. But this man, a pattern of ſordid avarice, was not likely to relieve another, when he would not even allow himſelf the neceſſary things of life.</p>
               <p>In this helpleſs ſituation, there was, luckily, one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource ſtill left for her ſubſiſtence. In the years of her proſperity, ſhe had adopted a young female orphan, named Clarinda, and ſhe now became her guardian angel. Mrs. Fairborne's former kindneſſes inſpired her with a wiſh of ſhewing that ſhe was grateful for them.</p>
               <p>No, ſaid ſhe, (when her unhappy miſtreſs mentioned her deſign of ſeeking the aſylum of a pariſh work-houſe.) I will never leave you. From your tenderneſs, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0360400704:58"/>received the treatment of a child; and, if in your proſperity I thought it ſo deſirable to be related to you by adoption, I ſtill think it more ſo, now, in your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
               <p>Thank Heaven and your adoption, I live comfortably. Your maternal conduct was evinced in teaching me all neceſſary female arts; I ſhall, at preſent, therefore, look upon it as a boaſt, that I can exerciſe my knowledge for your ſake. With health and courage, I ſhall be at leaſt enabled to procure a living for us both.</p>
               <p>The unhappy widow was exceedingly affected at this generous offer. She embraced Clarinda, and with joy conſented to accept it.</p>
               <p>We are now then to ſuppoſe Clarinda, in her turn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the mother, by adoption, of her former benefactreſs. She was far from thinking it enough to feed her with the produce of an unremitting labour; ſhe conſoled her in affliction, aided her in ſickneſs, and endeavoured by the tendereſt cares, to make up for all the injuſtice of her lot.</p>
               <p>The conſtancy and ardour of her attention did not relax a moment for two years, in which long time her miſtreſs was made happy by her bounty; and when death removed her, ſhe lamented with ſincerity, what ſhe conſidered as a grievous loſs.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er this, died alſo the kinſman above-mentioned, who had ſhewn himſelf ſo utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to every claim of gratitude and kindred. As he could not take his money with him, he ſuppoſed it would be making ſome atonement for his want of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection, if he left the injured lady all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>But this ſuccour came too late, as Mrs. Fairborne was not able to avail herſelf thereof, ſhe had not even the conſolation, at her death, of knowing that ſuch a change had happened in her fortune; as in that caſe, ſhe might eaſily have turned it to the benefit of her affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Clarinda.</p>
               <p>The inheritance in queſtion therefore fell, for want of heirſhip, to the King. As Providence would have it, the enquiries made on ſuch a rare occurrence, brought him to a knowledge of the generous orphan's conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0360400704:59"/>Ah! ſaid he, Clarinda merits this inheritance; and therefore I renounce my rights to favour her's; and will be happy to approve myſelf her friend and father.</p>
               <p>All the nation joined in the applauſe of ſuch a liberal action; and Clarinda, when poſſeſſed of this honourable recompence of her gratitude, employed it in maintaining orphans, ſuch as ſhe had been; and took the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in inſpiring them with ſentiments, like thoſe by which ſhe had herſelf deſerved her fortune.</p>

               <head>THE DIRTY BOOTS.</head>
               <p>FORTUNATUS, proud of his high birth, was not content with inwardly deſpiſing every one inferior to himſelf in point of fortune, but preſumed to take ſuch airs upon him as evinced the ſcorn with which he viewed them. As it chanced, one day he ſaw his father's foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cleaning ſhoes! Fooh! what a filthy buſineſs! cried he, as he paſſed him, turning up his noſe: for all the world I would not be a ſhoe-black.—Very likely, ſaid John; and I, for my part, hope that I ſhall never be <hi>your</hi> ſhoe-black.</p>
               <p>All the laſt week's weather had been very bad, but now it was grown clear and bright; on which account young Fortunatus received his father's permiſſion to take a ride on horſeback. Now the promiſe of this ride afforded him the greater pleaſure, as the day before, when he was out, he had been hindered, by a heavy ſhower of rain, from going far. However, he had been already far enough to ſplaſh his boots from top to bottom, and they were not yet quite dry.</p>
               <p>Tranſported with the thought of his ride, he ran down to John, who was at breakfaſt in the kitchen, and with an imperious tone of voice, cried out, "John, John! I am going out on horſeback! Run and clean my bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts! do you hear me?" John pretended that he did not, and continued at his breakfaſt, quite compoſed. In vain For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus put himſelf into a paſſion, and called him a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred names. John contented himſelf with anſwering him
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0360400704:60"/>very calmly, "I have told you, ſir, already, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, that I hoped never to become <hi>your</hi> ſhoe-black."</p>
               <p>In the mean time Fortunatus, ſeeing he could not, in ſpite of all his menaces, prevail upon John to do as he deſired, returned quite full of rage, and made complaint about him to his father. Mr. Railton could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend why John refuſed a buſineſs that belonged to his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and which hitherto he had performed without expecting orders for that purpoſe; ſo he ſent to ſpeak a little with him, and was told of the affair.</p>
               <p>His conduct was fully approved by Mr. Railton, who not only blamed his ſon, but told him that he might go and clean his boots himſelf, or ſtay at home, which ever he thought proper. He forbade the other ſervants to aſſiſt him in this buſineſs. "You will learn, ſir, (added he,) how filly it is to look with ſcorn on ſervices that contribute to our comfort and convenience; ſervices, the rigour of which you ſhould rather ſtrive to ſoften, by a gentleneſs of manners in yourſelf. Therefore, ſince a <hi>ſhoe-black's</hi> trade is ſo diſgraceful, be ſo kind as to ennoble it, by being for the future your own ſhoe-black."</p>
               <p>Such a ſentence turned his promiſed pleaſure into ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. He was very eager for a ride on horſeback, it was ſuch fine weather; but—to clean his boots himſelf! he could not ſtoop to ſuch an office. On the other hand, his pride would not permit him to go out with dirty boots, in which caſe every one that he met would ridicule him. He applied ſucceſſively to every ſervant in the houſe, with offers of money to corrupt them; but not one could be perſuaded to diſobey his maſter's order. Thus, then, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus was obliged to ſtay at home, till in the end his pride permitted him to ſtoop ſo low as the conditions laid upon him. On the next day John reſumed his office with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bidding; and the humbled Fortunatus, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed it once, would never afterwards gratify his pride, by vilifying what was in itſelf ſo uſeful.</p>

               <head>THE TATLER.</head>
               <p>AURELIA, though ſufficiently good-tempered, had contracted one great fault, and that was calumny. She publiſhed every where whatever ſhe perceived amiſs in others, though they were her deareſt friends. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience of her age induced her very often to aſcribe indifferent actions to improper motives; and a ſingle word or volatility of diſpoſition, was enough to make her form the worſt ſuſpicions which, as ſoon as ſhe had formed them, ſhe would run into company, and broach as if they were undoubted facts. She frequently even added circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to them drawn from her imagination, only with a view of making them more likely. You may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what miſchiefs ſuch a conduct muſt produce. It was not long before one family was ſet againſt another in her neighbourhood. The diſcord afterwards affected indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals: wives and huſbands, brothers, maſters and, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics, were at everlaſting variance with each other. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual confidence was on a ſudden done away from thoſe whoſe company the little girl frequented with her mother. People went ſo far, at laſt, as to ſhut up their doors againſt her, as they would have done againſt a wretched creature tainted with the plague; but neither hatred nor humiliation could correct a vice which cuſtom had ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rivetted within her heart.</p>
               <p>This glory was reſerved for Dorinda, her couſin, who was the only perſon now that would receive her viſits, and return them; as ſhe always lived in hopes of being able, in the end, to ſhew her the enormity of her behaviour, and preſerve her life from ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Miſs Aurelia went one day to ſee her couſin, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed an hour or two in telling ſpiteful tales of all their common friends, although ſhe knew with what uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs her couſin heard them. It was all the ſame to her.</p>
               <p>And now, dear Dorinda, ſaid Miſs Aurelia, having ſtopped for want of breath, your turn is come to tell me ſomething. You ſee company enough to have a ſtock of little anecdotes at all times ready on your hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0360400704:62"/>My dear Aurelia, anſwered Dorinda, whenever I am viſiting my friends, I wiſh to taſte the pleaſure of their company; and am not ſuch an idiot, as to loſe it by remarking their defects. Beſides I find within myſelf ſo many, that I cannot poſſibly have time to think of thoſe in others; having every need of their indulgence, I am wiſe enough to grant them mine. I rather chuſe to rivet my attention upon every commendable quality which they poſſeſs, and ſo endeavour to acquire it. One muſt be in a faultleſs ſtate one's ſelf, before one can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to note the faults of others. I congratulate you on this faultleſs ſtate, which I, on the contrary, am ſo unhappy as to want. Continue, couſin, this employment of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable cenſor, who would lead mankind to virtue by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the deformity of vice. You cannot fail of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eſteem of others for ſuch generous cares.</p>
               <p>Aurelia could not fail of being conſcious that ſhe was, long are this, become a public object of averſion and diſguſt; and therefore felt the ſeverity of her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin's ſarcaſm. She began from that day forward, to reflect with real ſeriouſneſs upon the danger of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion. She even trembled at the recollection of thoſe miſchiefs that ſhe had cauſed, and now determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to prevent their progreſs. It was difficult in the beginning, to throw off a cuſtom which ſhe had long indulged, of beholding things on the unfavourable ſide; but what can withſtand a ſteady reſolution? In the end, ſhe was ſo totally reformed, that ſhe applied her penetration to ſuch objects only as deſerved applauſe; and the deteſtable enjoyments of malignity within her, were ſucceeded by a purer ſatisfaction. She was now become the firſt to ſet equivocal or doubtful actions in ſuch points of view, that others might excuſe them. When ſhe could not put them in a favourable light, it is likely, ſhe would ſay, I do not know every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance attending them: no doubt, there were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable motives, ſuch as I am not acquainted with. In ſhort, whenever, as it ſometimes chanced, the caſe would not admit of any thing approaching to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of indulgence, ſhe would pity the offending per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and impute her fault to too great precipitation or ignorance of the miſchief that ſhe was committing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0360400704:63"/>However, it was very long indeed, before ſhe could regain thoſe hearts, which her former manners had alienated. She was come, by this time, to the age when moſt young women think of being ſettled, but could ſee no proſpect of a huſband. People had avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with ſo much care for years, that now ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much forgotten, as if ſhe had withdrawn herſelf into a convent from the world.</p>
               <p>No wonder then that ſhe ſhould ſuppoſe herſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to paſs her days in ſolitude, deprived of all thoſe pleaſures which accompany a happy marriage, and the enjoyment of a choſen ſet of friends: but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune determined otherwiſe; for a gentleman, who came upon a viſit to her father, having heard her generouſly undertake to ſhield the reputation of an abſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom ſome one in the company accuſed, was ſo delighted with a goodneſs like his own, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that ſhe was exactly of the turn of mind that would make him happy. He ſolicited her hand, and made her miſtreſs in return both of his heart, and his fortune.</p>
               <p>Aurelia, more and more convinced of the pernicious conſequences of blazing other people's faults, and the delightful ſatisfaction which ſelf-eſteem, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of worthy people cannot but beſtow;—of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy people! repeat, who wink at the defects of human nature;—every day propoſes her example to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to preſerve them from the ruin that ſhe had near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered.</p>
               <p>She has given me leave to write her ſtory in this book, for the inſtruction of my little friends; if there be any like her who may read it. I, for my part, know not whether there are any ſuch: but if there ſhould be, I perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that after the inſtruction of this ſtory, they will be the better for it.</p>

                  <p>I have been inceſſantly tormented with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand projects that have conſtantly deſtroyed each other.

                  <p>Have much more knowledge and intrinſic merit than old men, bent down beneath the weight of old age?—Agreed; but then it is very rare to ſee, at ſuch a tender age, that ſtrength of character which makes man active.</p>

Thus, Charles, you will never have to fear a miſemployment of your knowledge, which is too frequently the fault of young men, even ſuch as have the beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities.</p>

               <head>JULIAN AND ROSINA.</head>
               <p>ONCE upon a time a certain Mr. Lorimer was reading in a corner of his parlour, while his wife and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were employed, in ſilence, at their tambour-frame; when, on a ſudden, their little Julian entered haſtily, quite out of breath, his eye brim-full of tears, his hair in great diſorder, and one ſtocking down upon his heel. He had a raquet in his hand; and as he entered, he cried out, Come, mama, do pray, and ſee the mother of poor Chriſtopher and Frederic. Alas! they have not had a bit of any thing to eat all day. Frederic aſked me to play with him at ſhuttlecock, to make him forget, as he ſaid, that he was hungry; and they do not know how they ſhall get any thing before to-morrow evening, at the ſooneſt. I would fain have given them all the money in my purſe; but, would you think it? they refuſed it. I made anſwer, Come with me, and you ſhall ſee—No, no, ſaid they; we are already ſo obliged to your mama, and dare not go again to teaze her. Then too, their poor mother, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, burſt out a weeping.—But I muſt not cry, ſaid Julian, (crying ſtill more,) as my papa is reading. Ah! Roſina, had you ſeen them, you would certainly have cried as much as I! and ſtooping as he ſpoke, he laid hold of Roſina's apron by the corner, to wipe his eyes.</p>
               <p>The mother, melted into tears at this recital, and the little boy's behaviour thereupon, dropped her needle;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0360400704:68"/>and the father, to conceal a tear, held up his book before him.</p>
               <p>Come, dear children, then, ſaid Mrs. Lorimer, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Julian and Roſina with affection, come and let us ſee if we can help theſe three unhappy people.</p>
               <p>While Frederic, Chriſtopher, and the afflicted mother, knelt before their benefactreſs, Roſina pulled her brother by the coat, and in a whiſper aſked him if he recollected that nice little cake which their uncle gave them in the morning? Yes, ſaid Julian, and turned round as if he meant to run and fetch it. Keep mama in converſation here, and make believe as if you did not know that I was gone; for I will run and fetch it. No, no, ſaid Roſina, there is no need of that; for look, it is here.—On which the little lady, lifting up poor Frederic's hat, that lay accidentally on the table, ſhewed her brother the nice little cake, which ſhe had watched the opportunity of ſlipping underneath it.</p>

She indeed was quite a lady. Things are marvellouſly altered now, and we muſt alter with them. Patience! when we are once alone, I will tell you what more is to be done.

                     <p>Your papa will very ſoon be home. He went this morning to diſpatch ſome buſineſs out of doors, that he might have the afternoon entirely to himſelf; but, in the mean time, I can take you to your ſiſters, who will tell you what you are to think of me.</p>

                     <p>I wiſh them to ſpeak of you, but not firſt. I have a deal to ſay of my mama. <stage>(As they go out, Charles and Percival enter at the oppoſite ſide.)</stage>

                     <p>Why did you keep me from complaining to mama? I keep company with that little ſnarler! No, never. When his father once comes home, I will tell him what a waſpiſh ſon he has, that he may teach him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have a little better.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you think, then, that our papa will not be vexed, when told of this ſame difference between you both? and would it pleaſe you to afflict him?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Percival.</speaker>
                     <p>Certainly I ſhould be ſorry for it. And yet, what can I do? ſince, if this little gentleman is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for his rudeneſs the firſt day of coming home, there will be nothing but diſputes hereafter. He will be always affronting us. I am not very deliberate in ſuch caſes: I ſhall certainly be warm, and tell him what he ought to know; and if hereafter he ſhould think of taking airs on him, as juſt now—</p>

                     <p>But you do not ſuppoſe that I will let myſelf be beat by him?</p>

                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>To-morrow, very likely, we ſhall ſee; but now it would be improper to diſturb his father's ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſeeing him.</p>

                     <p>It appears to me that he ſcorns to look upon us as brothers.</p>

                     <p>Well, let him look a little to himſelf: I ſhall not put up with any inſult from him. But he's coming with his ſiſters: I will withdraw. I cannot endure the thoughts of ſuch a ſnappiſh gentleman.</p>

                     <p>If you give ear to Daniel, you will be worſe off for it, I can tell you. Why he wiſhed to make us quarrel with our brothers likewiſe. How ungrateful! Their mama conſents to have him for no other reaſon than becauſe ours begged papa, upon her death-bed, not to turn him off; and all his ſtudy is to make her children as unhappy as he can.</p>

                     <speaker>Priſcilla.</speaker>
                     <p>However, we muſt not tell any thing about it to papa; he would diſmiſs him: we muſt therefore carefully keep ſilence, and not ruin Daniel.</p>

                     <p>Look ye, there he is.— There, brother, with his ſiſters, going to our garden.</p>

                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>I am glad of that; for only think what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he will have, when he diſcerns how buſy we have been to ornament his portion of it!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Percival.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you think ſo? I, for my part, would lay any wager that he will find fault with every thing about him, he is ſo queer! The flowers, he will ſay, are badly choſen, or the box not planted as it ſhould be, or the ground too moiſt, or too dry, and twenty other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; but do you know that I am beginning to conſider you as touchy as you fancy him? I never ſaw you ſo before.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Percival.</speaker>
                     <p>It is he that cauſed it. Have his ſiſters ever had occaſion to complain of my behaviour? and I only wiſh to live upon good terms with him. You know with what impatience I expected his arrival here, and how I ran with open arms to meet him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>True indeed; but, as I ſaid before, it is very likely ſomething grieves him. He is afraid, perhaps, that his father will no longer love him, or our mother ſhew <hi>him</hi> leſs affection than he fancies ſhe does us. If ſo, then ſurely it is our duty to make much of him in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, and win him to be friends with us, by every gentle method in our power.</p>

                     <speaker>Percival.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>If he is as good as every body ſays, think, brother, how a little kindneſs on our part will, in the end, affect him; how his father will be fonder of us for it; and what pleaſure we ſhall give mama!</p>

                     <p>I was in the wrong, I own. Let him but come, and I will be ſo attentive to him, he muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably forget the paſt.</p>

                     <p>We were greatly to be pitied at the death of our mama. Papa, who is employed all day in buſineſs; could not look to us. There was for ever ſomething wrong in our cloaths, and our education was much more neglected.</p>

                     <p>But ſince our new mama is come, we are both ſet to rights. She gives us every entertainment ſuited to our age, and is a party with us in our little pleaſures. One would think her much more intereſted in the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our health, than of her own. I have not yet had time ſufficient to remark that I ſtand in need of any thing; ſhe makes beforehand ſuch proviſion for our wants!</p>

                     <speaker>Anne.</speaker>
                     <p>But lately I was ill; oh, very ill indeed! and it was herſelf that waited on me. She was always by my bed, and doing every thing in her power to comfort me. She made up all manner of nice things; and I believe, I ſhould have died, but for her great attention to me.</p>

                     <p>You know too, brother, that before you left us, we had not been any ways accuſtomed to employ our needle. Well; mama was kind enough to teach us. So that now we know—not only plain, but every ſort of fine work.</p>

               <head>THE MOUNTAIN LUTE.</head>
               <p>FROM the higheſt ſummit of thoſe hills which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the vale of Lucca in Savoy, I was contemplating the extended landſcape round about me: I was quite alone, my faithful ſervant being left in a neighbouring city, with orders not to expect me till at the end of three days; which interval I meant to ſpend in rambling over that romantic country. More than half way down the hill, I ſaw a hamlet, which aſſured me of a lodging for the night. Thus free from all inquietude, and ſwallowed up in thought, I let my mind roam at large in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation, and my eye to wander from one object to another of the ſpacious view. But ſoon the ſylvan choriſters laſt ſong admoniſhed me to think of retiring under cover for the night. The ſun, already hid behind the oppoſite mountain, did but colour with his gold and purple rays the clouds which floated, as it were, juſt cloſe above the trees that crown its ſummit. I deſcended ſlowly, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to ſee the ſpacious horizon, whoſe limits I could hardly trace, contract itſelf as I proceeded. The twilight now began to veil it with a ſhade, which by degrees grew browner, till the empreſs of the night diſpelled this gloomy darkneſs with her ſilver beams. I ſat down for a moment, to enjoy the picture. Nothing intercepted my view, throughout the vaſt expanſe. I contemplated the infinite extent at leiſure. From the trembling moon and ſtars which twinkled while I gazed upon them, I paſſed over to the calm and ſpotleſs azure of the firmament. The air was freſh, nor did the ſlighteſt breeze diſturb it. Nature was abſorbed in univerſal ſilence, ſaving the low murmur of a ſtream which meandered through the country at a diſtance. Stretched upon the graſs, I might perhaps have contemplated till the riſing of the ſun next morning: but the muſic of a lute, made more harmonious by a voice, ſoon after ſtruck upon my ear. I thought at firſt that my raviſhed ſenſes were deluded by the power of my imagination, and experienced the delight of fancying my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuddenly tranſported in a dream to what are called the regions of enchantment. In the midſt of this illuſion, while both m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſies ſtill continued, A lute! ſaid I riſing,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0360400704:89"/>a lute upon the mountain! I turned round to that ſide whence the melody proceeded, and diſcovered through the dark ſome verdure of the trees, no great way diſtant, the white walls and garden paling of a cottage. I approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with a beating heart; but what was my ſurprize, when I beheld a youthful peaſant with a lute, on which he was playing with exquiſite addreſs. A woman, ſeated on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hand, was looking at him with an eye of the tendereſt affection. At their feet, upon the turf, were many children, boys and girls, and ancient people, all in attitudes of pleaſure and attention. When I firſt made my appearance, ſeveral of the children came to meet me, looked at one another, and then ſaid among themſelves, What gentleman is this? The young muſician turned his head, but did not leave off playing. I could not poſſibly withſtand the firſt emotions of my heart. I held him out my hand; he gave me his, which I laid hold of with a ſort of tranſport. Every body upon this roſe and made a circle round us. I informed them, as conciſely as I could do, of my buſineſs in that quarter of the country, and at ſuch a time of night. We have not an inn, for many miles round, remarked the youthful peaſant, as our ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let is not near the road; but if you are content to lie in a poor cabin, we will do our beſt to entertain you.</p>
               <p>If at firſt I was aſtoniſhed at his execution on the lute, and taſte in ſinging, I was ſtill much more ſurpriſed at the politeneſs of his manners, the preciſion of his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the eaſe with which he ſpoke. You were not born, ſaid I to him, in a cabin? Pardon me, replied he with a ſmile; I <hi>was,</hi> and even in this. But you are fatigued, I ſuppoſe; George, bring a chair. Excuſe me, ſir; I owe my neighbours this nocturnal entertainment which I am now giving them.</p>
               <p>I would not take the chair, but laid myſelf upon the graſs, as all the reſt did. Every body had, by this time, reſumed his former poſture; and the ſilence which I had interrupted by appearing as I did among them, now took place again.</p>
               <p>The youth began immediately to play upon his lute; and in the intervals of playing, ſung a favourite ballad, which he did with ſo much ſweetneſs, that a tear, as I could ſee, ſtood trembling in the eye of every one about
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0360400704:90"/>him, by the time that he had repeated the firſt couplet. I could not refrain from envying the ſurprizing genius of this ruſtic bard, whoever he might be, that could impreſs ſo powerfully an unlettered, and almoſt an uncivilized ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of people. I was charmed in ſeeing how ſurpriſingly thoſe beauties that are drawn from nature, pleaſe the ſouls of all men. Of the poet's touches, none were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, I heard round about me, nothing but ſighs, and half ſtifled ſobs.</p>
               <p>After ſome few minutes ſilence, the whole company roſe, each wiping, as I could ſee, his eyes. They wiſhed each other a good night with perfect cordiality. The neighbours, with their children, went away, and none were left, except an ancient man upon a ſeat beſide the door, and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m till now I had not noticed; the muſician, with the woman ſitting by him; George, the young boy whore name I recollected; and myſelf.</p>
               <p>It was painful for me to give up the charming ſtate in which at that time I was plunged. I ſtill continued fitting, but got up at laſt, and drawing near the young muſician, put my arms out, as it were by inſtinct, to embrace him. Sweet it is, ſaid I, to meet with people who ſurprize us at the firſt ſlight glance, and finiſh by attracting our eſteem, before a quarter of an hour is paſſed. He anſwered me no other way than by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent graſp of my hand, while I was ſpeaking. Dear ſir, began the old man upon this, you are pleaſed, I perceive, with our evening's entertainment? I am glad you have conceived ſo ſuddenly a friendſhip for my dear Valentine, for which you ſhall repoſe you in my bed. No, father, interrapted George, who came running from the barn, I have been littering me ſome ſtraw; and the gentleman ſhall he in <hi>my</hi> bed, if he pleaſes. I was forced to promiſe that I would yield to this laſt offer. George, upon this, held out his hand; the old man reſted on his ſhoulder, and went in, after wiſhing me a good night: and now I found myſelf alone with Valentine, and the young woman, who, he told me, was his ſpouſe. I aſked them, if, for my ſake, they would not paſs fifteen minutes more, in converſation with me, where they then were, as it was moon-light? Willingly, ſaid Louiſa, who was not a little vain of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0360400704:91"/>the attention that I had paid her huſband. Yes, quite willingly, replied Valentine, who ſaw how much his wife deſired it.</p>
               <p>I ſat down between them, with a linden tree behind me; through whoſe foliage, the moon darted all her brightneſs.</p>
               <p>My dear friends, ſaid I, taking the woman by the hand, pray let me know how long you have enjoyed your preſent happineſs? Theſe ſix months, anſwered ſhe; and now it is upwards of a twelvemonth that Valentine is happily returned among us from his travels. You have travelled then? ſaid I, with ſome ſurpriſe, excited by this intimation. Yes, ſir, anſwered Valentine: I have viſited a part of Europe.—Every thing that I ſee about you, interrupted I, and every thing that I hear you ſay, excites a deal of wonder in me! if you have no ſecret motive for concealing the tranſactions of your life, do not refuſe me, I beſeech you, the pleaſure of hearing them. Certainly you will not, anſwered Louiſa, with great ſimplicity. The gentleman ſeems a very civil kind of a perſon. Beſides, I take much pleaſure myſelf in liſtening to them.</p>
               <p>He conſented, with a ſmile, to our requeſt and the following narrative is delivered in his own words, as far as my remembrance has preſerved them.</p>
               <p>As I have mentioned, I was born, ſir, in this cottage, towards the end of the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-four; being at preſent, three-and-twenty years of age. I had the misfortune to loſe my mother, when an infant, being hardly weaned. My father was in eaſy, though not in affluent circumſtances, but a law-ſuit into which he was forced, by one who is at preſent no more, but was then a very wealthy farmer, ruined him entirely; and he died of grief, when he was torn from his paternal cottage, and beheld it ſold for the advantage of the lawyers. The old man whom you ſaw juſt now, and who is become my father, bought and came to ſettle in it. He was ſtruck with pity, ſeeing me an orphan at my early time of life, and, though I was ſo little, told me that I ſhould be his ſhepherd. I was treated very kindly by him; and his children looked upon me as their brother. Notwithſtanding which, the loſs of my poor father, the unkindneſs of my other kindred
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0360400704:92"/>who forſook me, with the thought of being nothing but a ſtranger in the cottage where I firſt had my exiſtence, and the lonely life that I led upon the mountain, all united to afflict me, and my accuſtomed gaiety was changed to melancholy. I conſumed whole days in weeping, while my flocks were grazing round me on the plain.</p>
               <p>(Here Louiſa withdrew her hand, which I held in mine, to wipe away a falling tear, and then returned it me.)</p>
               <p>One evening I was ſitting on the ſummit of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and amuſing my afflicted thoughts by ſinging, to myſelf, the very ballad that you have juſt now heard. Towards the concluſion, I obſerved a man among the trees. I noticed that he was dreſſed in brown: his countenance was very pale; he ſeemed quite melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; and he waited till my ſong was finiſhed. He then came cloſe to me, and enquired how far he might be from the public road? Oh very far, dear ſir, ſaid I; above five miles. Can you conduct me thither? I would do ſo gladly, but that I cannot quit my flock.— perhaps your parents may accommodate me with a lodging for the night?—Ah, ſir! my parents are a great way off.—Where, then?—They lived like honeſt people upon earth, and they are happy now in heaven.</p>
               <p>The tone of my voice, as he informed me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, affected this good man, and my reply, he ſaid, could not but touch him. He put ſeveral queſtions to me, and my anſwers pleaſed him. Night by this time being come, I brought him to our cottage; and my maſter entertained him hoſpitably. On the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, they had ſome diſcourſe together with regard to me, and when I was prepared to reaſſume my daily charge, they told me that George would take it in future, as the ſtranger meant to have me with him. I would be uſeleſs were I to tell you what was my affliction at the thought of quitting this dear cottage, though not mine, and parting from my Louiſa, whom I loved even then, though ſhe was quite a child. My ſituation was not any way a happy one; and yet I could not quit it without ſhedding tears. I could not poſſibly foreſee that my future deſtination was to be decided by the preſent moment. Yes, to thee benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0360400704:93"/>protector of my youth, I am a debtor for my preſent happineſs! Thou knoweſt, generous man, how ardently I prayed to God for thy proſperity while thou wert living, and with what exhauſtleſs gratitude I bleſs even ſtill thy aſhes! He was called <hi>Lafont,</hi> and had the place of organiſt in no great pariſh. You would judge imperfectly of his abilities, if you adverted to the nature and obſcurity of his employment. Many tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers turned out of their road to hear his muſic; but their praiſes only made him the more modeſt. I much doubt, if in the courſe of your acquaintance, you have ever met with ſuch a genius. He received from the affection of his father, who, when living, was a very great phyſician, ſuch an education as would certainly have made <hi>him</hi> eminent as a phyſician likewiſe; but he rather choſe to yield himſelf entirely to the ardent paſſion that he had long before conceived for muſic. He had married the daughter of the organiſt, whom he ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but was childleſs. His dear wife, whom he had loſt for ſeveral years, ſtill lived within his heart. Her image, and his books, were now his only ſociety in that deep melancholy which had ſeized upon his mind; but ſtill while he avoided men, he did not hate them. On the contrary, he did much good in ſecret. He was forty years of age when I came to him. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed me at firſt to read and write, and afterwards took pleaſure in the cultivation of my voice, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to play the lute, which was his favourite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. He did not ſtop at muſical inſtruction, he provided me ſelections from the works of our greateſt poets. He formed at once my heart, my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and my taſte. Thus he acted, for five years, the part of an aſſiduous maſter, without any expectation of reward for all his pains and labour, but from him, who beſt knows how to recompence the ſervices that we do to our fellow-creatures.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of all theſe occupations, I had never ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from my mind the recollection of my cottage, or the countenance of Louiſa, the partner of my childiſh paſtimes. I was often ſpeaking of them to my patron, and accordingly one day—I never ſhall forget it, the firſt of June, four years ago—he roſe betimes, and going, as his cuſtom was, to take a morning's walk, bade me fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0360400704:94"/>him. We talked of many matters while we went along, as chance preſented ſubjects for our converſation; till at laſt he brought me to the very mountain where I ſaw him at firſt. Dear Valentine, ſaid he, I have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the duty which Providence, I thought, impoſed upon me, when firſt I ſaw you. I am ſenſible how much you ſigh when you reflect upon the habitation whence I took you; and have had no other view in undertaking to protect and educate you, than at laſt to put you in a way of getting poſſeſſion of it once again. I now ſhew it you; look at it: but take notice, I forbid, on pain of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, your returning thither, till ſuch time as you have wherewithal to purchaſe it. I give you my own lute: I have inſtructed you to play upon it. Travel: you are not without a charming voice. Wherever you are heard, having no other pretenſions than to the name of an itinerant muſician, you will be the firſt of artiſts in your way. The novelty of the thing will never fail to bring you auditors and money: only be diſcreet and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal; and when rich enough, return into your own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and buy out your father's cottage.</p>
               <p>My heart beat high at this diſcourſe, and grew enlarged with hope and joy. He held me to his boſom, ſhedding tears. They were the firſt that I ever yet had ſeen fall from him, and they made a ſingular impreſſion on me. After this, we thought of coming back, and he conducted me in ſilence to his houſe.</p>
               <p>Upon the morrow, at the break of day, I was to leave my benefactor: he beſtowed on me, at parting, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which he imagined I moſt needed, together with two louis d'ors. In four years time I travelled on foot through Italy, all France, and Germany, equipped like what I was, a peaſant of the mountains, with my hair as you may ſee at preſent, floating in large curls upon my ſhoulders. I took notice that the ſingularity of ſuch a dreſs increaſed the effect proceeding from my muſic, and particularly in the capitals. Few noblemen. I ſuppoſe, ever travelled more agreeably than I did. Every where I found a good reception, and not only from the middling ſort of people, but the moſt polite. The quality in cities made up concerts, for no other purpoſe than to hear me; and in villages, I verily believe, they married for the mirth of dancing to the muſic of my inſtrument. In many
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0360400704:95"/>places I had advantageous offers made me to take up my reſidence among them. They ſeduced me ſometimes, I acknowledge, for an inſtant; but as ſoon as I reflected again on my cottage, every thought of fortune vaniſhed; nor of all my projects left one trace remaining. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſtill what ſweet ſenſations ſeized me every time when I went over a mountain in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Valentine ſung theſe couplets with ſuch ſweetneſs and expreſſion, as revived in my mind the fabulous ideas of Apollo; and methought I heard that exiled deity on earth, and in the vales of Theſſaly, pouring forth his wiſhes to return to Olympus. I deſired to ſpeak, to cry out; but found my tongue without motion. Valentine could not but co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive the meaning of my ſilence, and went on as follows:</p>
               <p>I am now about to tell you by what means I came again into poſſeſſion of this precious cottage.</p>
               <p>Towards December laſt, when I had taken up my dwelling for a ſeaſon at Turin, and had been twice from one extremity of Italy to the other, I examined the ſtate of my purſe, and conceived myſelf then rich enough to pay a viſit to my native mountain. I immediately ſet out, and after ſeveral forced journeys, came in ten days time to the city where my benefactor had reſided. With what anxious expectation did I enter it! and as I went along, aſk every one that I met, what tidings he could give me of him? But, alas! I was not to enjoy the pleaſure of expreſſing what I owed him; nor to behold him, happy in the conſequences of the friendſhip that he had ſhewn me. He had been dead two months. I went to pour out my tears on his tomb, and made a vow to heaven that I would call my firſt child by his name, if I ever ſhould be ſo happy as to prove a father. On the evening of that day I gained this hamlet. Every one. I found, ſpoke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of me, without knowing at firſt who I was. My lute, and the remembrance of our friendſhip, ſoon obtained me Louiſa's affection. I received her from her father. I bought back, with his conſent, the cottage, and the field belonging to it, for two hundred crowns, with which his eldeſt ſon procured a farm below us, in the village, and has been now ſome time ſettled in it. With reſpect to himſelf, he acquieſced to paſs the remnant of his days, with George his youngeſt ſon, in our cottage. It is from him that I learn the art of huſbandry; for now that I am once more in poſſeſſion of my little patrimony, the amount of my ambition is to be, as was my father, a good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, a kind parent, and a virtuous peaſant. I have not, as you may ſee, forgot my lute, the precious inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which made my fortune; but ſtill keep it at my ſide,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0360400704:97"/>and often take it up for my own recreation, or to pleaſe my family and neighbours.</p>
               <p>He ſtopped ſhort at this; but ſtill, I thought, I heard him ſpeaking. My attention, captivated by his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, was turned inſenſibly upon his perſon, after he had finiſhed. His ingenuous animated countenance, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt of his dreſs and converſation, his attachment to a ruſtic habitation, and the gratitude with which he che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the remembrance of his benefactor; his uncommon fortune, travels, and profeſſion; every thing, I thought, exhibited the youth, in ſome ſort, as a being of enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuperior to the ordinary race of men. Louiſa firſt rouſed me from my contemplation, by her motion in the act of leaning forward to embrace him. I compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented them on their happineſs, and they returned my civility with the moſt ingenuous expreſſions of friendſhip. We went into the cottage, where I was charmed to behold ſuch an appearance of order and cleanlineſs about me. After having made a plentiful, but light repaſt, upon ſuch fruits as I was told the mountain yielded, George led me to a cloſet which was rather narrow, but the bed that filled it was both clean and wholeſome. Of this bed, the little fellow told me, he diſpoſed with pleaſure in my favour. It was not long before I fell into a ſound ſleep, during which my thoughts were occupied upon the grand objects that I had been contemplating in the evening, and the agreeable ſenſations which had ſo recently impreſſed me. I did not, all the following day, once quit this happy family, when they were either buſy at work or unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
               <p>Valentine related to me many entertaining matters that occurred to him in travelling, and explained how he acquired that eaſineſs of manners and politeneſs of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that had charmed me at firſt, and which afterwards, as I diſcovered, notwithſtanding his great youth, conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated the reſpect and love of every aged individual through the hamlet. The acuteneſs of his underſtanding, the unſtudied openneſs of Louiſa, the old man's blunt good ſenſe, the reſtleſs curioſity of George, made their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation intereſting, and diffuſed an undeſcribable variety through every part thereof, which both charmed me, and connected them much cloſer to each other. I think, I
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0360400704:98"/>could have paſſed my life away quite happy with them. But why, ſaid I to myſelf, why brood on ſuch a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation? I was to leave them that very night. I confeſs, I felt a pang of ſadneſs to reflect upon our ſeparation, and imagined, by their looks, that it would occaſion them ſome ſorrow likewiſe. If my fortune ſhould in future permit me to diſpoſe of the remainder of my life with more liberty, I then intended, and do ſtill, to make a yearly viſit to this mountain, for the purpoſe of ſeeing my friends again, and filling my whole heart with thoſe ſenſations of contentedneſs and peace which their ſociety and habitation cannot but inſpire.</p>

               <head>THE SLOVEN.</head>
               <p>URBAN paſſed, and very juſtly, for an excellent boy. He was extremely gentle, always ready to oblige his little friends, and never once diſpleaſed his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or inſtructors.</p>
               <p>He had one great fault, however; he would loſe his books, with other matters, and pay no attention to his clothes, which were in common very dirty. In one word, he was a ſloven.</p>
               <p>He had often been admoniſhed of, and puniſhed for, his negligence. This puniſhment and admonition grieved him, both on his own account, and as he knew that his friends were ſorry to proceed thus harſhly with him. He had many times reſolved upon amendment; but the habit was ſo ſtrong, that, notwithſtanding every reſolution, he had always the ſame ſlovenly appearance.</p>
               <p>His papa ſome time ago had promiſed him and his three brothers, on the firſt fine day, to take them out upon the water. Such a day as he could wiſh, now came: there hardly was a capfull of wind, and he remarked the water very ſmooth. He therefore called the children, told them his deſign, and as he lived quite cloſe beſide the river, went himſelf into the garden and picked out the neateſt beat then plying.</p>
               <p>How rejoiced the little gentlemen appeared! and how alert to make their preparation for a day of pleaſure which they had been ſo long expecting!</p>
               <p>They were now all ready to ſet out when Mr. Weſton came to take them. They jumped round about him in the tranſport of their joy; and Mr. Weſton, on his ſide, was very happy to remark their ſatisfaction: but what was his wonder, when he ſaw Urban, to obſerve the unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his apparel.</p>
               <p>Of his ſtockings, one was, as they ſay, about his heels; the other negligently gartered, if at all; in ſome ſort made his leg look like a twiſted column. Two great holes were in his breeches knees; his waiſtcoat was from top to bottom ſtained with greaſe or ink; and there was wanting half a collar to his coat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0360400704:103"/>The father ſaw with ſorrow, that it was impoſſible to take him in ſo ſlovenly a ſtate; as every one would have thought, with reaſon, that the father of ſo ſlovenly a child muſt be as negligent himſelf, to ſuffer ſuch a fault. And ſeeing that Mr. Weſton was a man of merit, and eſteemed by thoſe who knew him, he was far from wiſhing ſuch addition to his character.</p>
               <p>Urban had another coat, but that unhappily was at the taylor's to be repaired; and it was not a trifle that would repair it, as it wanted one whole ſkirt, which had been torn quite off. The ſcowerer was to have it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and work a day, at leaſt, in getting out the dirt and ſpots.</p>
               <p>What was the conſequence then, my dear little friends? There is not one of you but may eaſily gueſs.</p>
               <p>His brothers, who had proper clothes to put on, and whoſe general appearance did their father credit, were admitted into the boat. The body of it was painted blue, as were the oars. The gunnel and the edges of the oars were of a deep vermillion. In the boat there was a linen awning, that is roof, ſupported at the corners, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the company beneath it from the ſun: the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had nice white linen ſhirts on; three muſicians had their ſtation in the ſtern; they were provided with a haut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, clarionet and violin, and began to play a march in concert when the watermen firſt dipped their oars into the water, upon which a crowd who were aſſembled at the ſtairs replied thereto with joyous ſhoutings.</p>
               <p>Poor Urban, who had pleaſed himſelf a long time with the thoughts of ſuch an airing, was obliged to ſtay at home. It is true, he had the pleaſure from a window of obſerving his papa and brothers go into the boat, and of following it as far upon the river as his eye would let him, while a gentle breeze ſwelled out the ſails, and made it ſeem to ſkim along upon the ſurface of the water: and it is true, his brothers, after their return, related all the pleaſures that they had taſted in their day's excurſion; and of which the recollection made them ſtill jump for joy.</p>
               <p>Another day, as he was playing in a meadow, with a little friend of his, he chanced to loſe a buckle; but inſtead of ſeeking diligently for it, he begged his comrade for a little while to lend him his, becauſe, in walking to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0360400704:104"/>and fro, the ſtraps, which he trod on now and then, had already more than once been like to trip him up.</p>
               <p>His little friend conſented; and Urban, being quite intent on ſomething, and extremely anxious to renew his motion, faſtened it ſo negligently that in leſs than twenty minutes time he loſt that alſo.</p>
               <p>They were both exceedingly embarraſſed when the time was come for their returning home. Night overtook them, and the graſs was ſo high that a lamb might eaſily have hid himſelf entirely in it. How then could they find, at duſk, a thing ſo little? They came home clum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petty clump, each leaning on the other, and quite ſad; particularly Urban, who, poſſeſſing real ſenſibility, was grieved in having thus expoſed his boſom friend and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to the anger of his parents.</p>
               <p>On the morrow he appeared before the family, when they were aſſembled together, with a ſingle buckle for two ſhoes. Sad ſight for Mr. Weſton! who perceived by that how much his exhortations were ſtill thrown away.</p>
               <p>As oft as Monday came about, he was accuſtomed to ſupply Urban and his brothers with a regular allowance, that they might not be without the means of ſatisfying what are uſually the wants of children, but particularly any impulſe to be generous. Urban's brothers had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the pleaſure of receiving this allowance; while he, poor fellow, hardly ever had any of it, on account of ſtoppages for buttons, handkerchiefs, and other things that he loſt.</p>
               <p>A ſilver buckle coſts ſome money; but this was not the whole. He had loſt his companion's, and was therefore obliged to pay for that likewiſe. How was he to do it? His allowance would not have enabled him to clear this debt in three months time.</p>
               <p>His father luckily had taught him, even in his earlieſt infancy, to uſe a pen; and, to employ the common phraſe, he wrote already an exceedingly fine hand.</p>
               <p>This, therefore, was the only occupation by which he could earn a little money; and, to his praiſe I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, he conſented with a deal of willingneſs to an arrangement made on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>His companion's father was an eminent attorney, and employed above a dozen clerks to copy papers for him. Mr. Weſton therefore offered him Urban's ſervices in this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0360400704:105"/>way, 'till ſuch time as he had earned enough to pay him for the buckle; and requeſted that the attorney would conſent to ſuch a way of ſettling matters, as it was very probable Urban might be greatly benefited by it.</p>
               <p>The attorney freely acquieſced, and down Urban ſat to work in copying law proceedings, which at beſt were very tedious, and in general ſcrawled over ſo that he could hardly read them, whilſt his brothers went a walking in the fields, or entertained themſelves by playing with each other in the garden.</p>
               <p>Oh, how many ſighs did his inattention coſt him! and how much pleaſure did it occaſion him to loſe in a very few days!</p>
               <p>He had time for making many ſalutary comments on his conduct; and reſolving, for the time to come, upon a change. In ſhort, he kept his reſolution; ſo that were I now to point him out, dear little friends, to any of you, —when you noticed the cleanlineſs of his perſon, and the neatneſs of his general appearance, you would find it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to think that he could be the ſame little boy whoſe hiſtory I have juſt now written for your inſtruction as well as amuſement.</p>

                  <p>To confeſs the truth, I have; and think you hardly the ſame perſon that you were formerly. What can have cauſed ſo great an alteration? Till you quitted England, ay, and unce you came from France, I muſt acknowledge you were proud and huffiſh. You offended every body without ſcruple, and the leaſt familiarity from others was conſidered as an inſult by you; but at preſent your behaviour is engaging. You have that complacency and affability which cannot but win people's hearts. I freely tell you, I myſelf even love you ten times more at preſent than I did. You took ſuch airs upon you before
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0360400704:107"/>as diſguſted me. I was a hundred times diſpoſed to break off all connection with you; whereas now, I find a real pleaſure in your company and converſation. And what pleaſes me ſtill more than all is, that you ſeem yourſelf much happier than before.</p>

                  <p>And ſo I am, dear friend. I was an object to be pitied at the time that you mention. I occaſioned all our family, and every one that wiſhed me well, a deal of trouble. Miſs Le Févre, in particular, was grieved to think of my behaviour, as ſhe loved me tenderly; and yet, while I was grieving her, I knew that ſhe faithfully fulfilled the promiſe which ſhe made to my dear mama, upon her dying-bed, of loving me with all the affection of a mother.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                  <p>Every body muſt confeſs, you could not poſſibly have fallen into better hands; and the advantage of your trip to France would have been really conſiderable had it only been the means of introducing ſuch a perſon to you, I am told, there are few families but would wiſh to have her for their children.</p>

                  <speaker>Araminta.</speaker>
                  <p>You are yet to know how much I owe her; therefore I deſign to tell you. It is the ſtory of a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that will live for ever in my recollection: it was the morning of the 4th of this very month, and as I knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, her birth-day. I was awake betimes. She muſt be ſtill aſleep, ſaid I; for then we did not lie together, no not even in the ſame apartment. I will ſurpriſe her, if I can, before ſhe riſes; ſo I dreſſed myſelf as nicely as I could, then took the baſket which a charming little lady, you know who, <stage>(ſhe ſqueezes Emily by the hand)</stage> had given me as a preſent, and ran down into the garden to get flowers, that I might ſcatter them on Miſs Le Févre's bed, as is the cuſtom upon birth-days in her country. I ſtole ſecretly along the hedge, and, unperceived by any one, had gathered three freſh roſes. I now looked about for honeyſuckles, jeſſamin, and myrtle: I bethought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that they grew below the arbour at the bottom of the garden. I was running thither; but in paſſing by the arbour I ſaw Miſs Le Févre on her knees within it, and both hands before her face; I turned to ſhun her, but it was all in vain; ſhe heard my ſteps, on which ſhe raiſed her head, perceived me, and called out that I ſhould come that moment to her.</p>

Noting her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of me, which was friendly and affectionate, I could not but obſerve that ſhe had a countenance of ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>With one hand ſhe inſtantly took hold of mine, and paſſed the other round my middle. We walked up and down the terrace twice in this poſition, and were ſilent; for, as Mademoiſelle forbore to ſay a word, I durſt not move my lips, ſo much was I affected by it!</p>
                  <p>But at length ſhe preſſed me ſtill more cloſely to her boſom, and beholding me with tenderneſs, and likewiſe glan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This affectionate attention to me would certainly make me forget the melancholy thoughts which oppreſs my mind upon your account, but that your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs occaſioned them. Yes, deareſt Araminta, attribute only to my friendſhip what I am now about to mention. I am anxious to diſcharge my boſom of its load, that I may welcome afterward thoſe more delightful thoughts which I owe you for the preſent, that, I obſerve, you were preparing for me.</p>
                  <p>I was dumb, and in a tremble, while ſhe thus addreſſed me: it was as if my conſcience had addreſſed me by her lips.</p>
                  <p>You, Araminta, continued ſhe, who have received from nature ſuch a diſpoſition, and have had that diſpoſition ſo well cultivated by the example and inſtructions of your good mama, will you pervert it by a fault which of itſelf alone muſt put out every virtue? I will not mention it by name; and now particularly, after what I have already told you. It might make you perhaps look with too much horror on yourſelf; and I have no deſire to mortify my lovely child. It is ſufficient that your heart acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges this fault: and I perſuade myſelf, I know you well enough to be aſſured that your utmoſt efforts will, in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be excited to deſtroy it.</p>
                  <p>Let us not go too fat back; but only think of your behaviour yeſterday.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0360400704:113"/>Do you remember the deciſive tone of voice with which you ſpoke when at breakfaſt, to diſplay how much you knew of hiſtory? You cited, I muſt own, events ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſtructive to have made the company attend to what you ſaid, but that they ſaw you reſolved, if I may ſay ſo, to excite their admiration. You appeared ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly well contented with yourſelf, that they were really afraid of praiſing you, which would have unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably inflamed or aggravated your ſelf-love. Remember likewiſe, with how much attention they gave ear to little Arabella, and were really enchanted with the grace of her recital, and the modeſty with which ſhe bluſhed at being thought ſo well informed. I ſaw you, my dear, turn pale with ſpite and envy. Tears of rage were in your eyes, and it was in vain that you ſtrove to hide them, while the company were inwardly rejoiced to ſee you ſo compleatly humbled.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon, when with an air of triumph in your eyes you came to ſhew your writing, and it paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any of thoſe praiſes that you expected— with what viſible vexation did you receive it back when every one had ſeen it!</p>
                  <p>And at night, when you accompanied Miſs Arabella on the harpſichord, the bad time that you kept, perhaps on purpoſe, put her out; and when ſhe aſked you in a whiſper to play better, what a hideous look did you then put on, inſtead of doing as ſhe bade you?</p>
                  <p>Ah! for heaven's ſake, interrupted I, and at the ſame time burſt out a crying: Do not go on, for you muſt know, Emily, her diſcourſe had pierced me to the heart.</p>
                  <p>It was vanity, ſaid I to Mademoiſelle: that vice which you durſt not mention by its name. I never ſaw its fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſo much, believe me, as at preſent.</p>
                  <p>I could ſay no more; but ſhe was able to diſcern my thoughts. Her arm in agitation preſſed me once more to her boſom with a tenderneſs that I am unable to deſcribe. I felt her tears fall plenteouſly upon my cheeks, while with her eyes ſhe looked in ſilence up to heaven.</p>
                  <p>The cloquence of this mute prayer compleatly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed me. We were come, without perceiving it, to the foot of this large tree. We ſtopped cloſe by this green bank, and I fell down upon it half ſwooning as it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0360400704:114"/>were. She inſtantly afforded me the tendereſt ſuccour, and reſtored me to new life by her affectionate careſſes.</p>
                  <p>Being juſt upon the point of going in, I ſaid, renewing my embraces, dry your tears up, my good friend; they are the laſt that you ſhall have cauſe to ſhed on my account.</p>
                  <p>On her part, ſhe embraced me ſtill more tenderly, and anſwered, ſaying, You could never have rejoiced me ſo compleatly on my birth-day as by this noble reſolution. It is the fitteſt noſegay for us both, the noſegay that I hope will never loſe its beauty.</p>
                  <p>By degrees we both became more tranquil. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked the fineneſs of the morning; and my heart, now eaſed of an intolerable load, was in a proper diſpoſition to enjoy the beauty of the day which came on very fine.</p>
                  <p>I grew ſenſible how ſweet it is to have the experience of this calm within one's ſelf. I begged her to inſtruct me by what means I might keep up ſo pleaſing a ſerenity. Two hours thus paſſed away between us in a converſation full of friendſhip and affectionate inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>My papa, without informing me of his intention, had prepared a little banquet; we were preſent at it, and gave ſigns with how much joy our boſoms overflowed. Since then, dear friend, I have begun to put away that odious vice which made me inſupportable to others and myſelf. I leave you then to think, if I can poſſibly omit, on the return of ſuch a day, to teſtify my gratitude for ſuch a worthy friend, who was the means of making it the are of my happineſs.</p>

                     <p>Oh! there is no occaſion, ſir, for that: what I have to ſay is rather affecting than alarming. What are your ideas then of our laſt pupil, Edward Barton?</p>

                     <p>For theſe ten days paſt, that he has been among us, you are ſenſible, I have not had an opportunity of even ſpeaking to him. This, however, I can ſay in his behalf, that when his parents brought him, I remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething in his countenance that pleaſed me mightily. Do any of the Aſſiſtants take offence at his behaviour?</p>

                     <speaker>The Aſſiſtant.</speaker>
                     <p>The reverſe. They give him all poſſible praiſe for his diligence; and the greatneſs of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo charms them. He is come among us with more knowledge than our own ſcholars of three years ſtanding generally have; in ſhort, his ſchool-mates only and myſelf have reaſon to be diſcontented with him.</p>

                     <p>I am ſo indeed; but much leſs on my own account than on his. I do not know what it means, but there muſt be ſome deep anxiety upon his mind. I have had recourſe to many methods for diſcovering it, but have been always bafiled.</p>

                     <speaker>The Aſſiſtant.</speaker>
                     <p>In the firſt place, ſir, he is very ſtudious when in ſchool, and nothing can divert him from the buſineſs of it: but in play-time he is ſilent and reſerved among the ſcholars. I have given him two, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be the ſprightlieſt, as companions, and enjoined them to do every thing in their power to pleaſe him. He is ſenſible indeed to their endeavours, and acknowledges their kindneſs; but when all is done, their fire is utterly incapable of warming him, and he appears between them juſt like ſo much ice. <hi>Yes,</hi> gentlemen; <hi>no,</hi> gentlemen; and ſuch like monoſyllables, are all his anſwers to their queſtions.</p>

                     <speaker>The Maſter.</speaker>
                     <p>He is ſad, no doubt, at being ſeparated from his parents?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>The Aſſiſtant.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, it is very natural to think ſo; yet his ſadneſs has continued now ten days; and can we think a child of only twelve years of age really ſuſceptible of an impreſſion for that length of time?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>The Aſſiſtant.</speaker>
                     <p>Pardon, ſir, my contradicting you; for if that age is very lively, it is variable alſo, and ſince I have been a tutor here, I have noticed that all thoſe who have been moſt afflicted at the thought of being ſeparated from their parents, have, and very ſhortly, been induced by their companions to forget that ſeparation. Now whatever Edward's notions may be on this head, what will you think when I have told you every thing?</p>

                     <p>Would you believe it then, ſir, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes every thing at meal time, but a little bread and water. It is not poſſible that any criminal ſhould be condemned to coarſer fare than what he voluntarily chuſes!</p>

                     <speaker>The Aſſiſtant.</speaker>
                     <p>True, ſir; but with us, where ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt not be ſuffered, and the little ſoldier is to be ſubmiſſive to general ſubordination, there is room to fear ſome danger to the reſt in his example. Twenty times would I have made him eat the victuals ſet before him; but to all my inſtances, he has no otherwiſe made anſwer, than by turning towards me, and in tears,—I weep myſelf to think of his affecting way.</p>

                     <speaker>The Maſter.</speaker>
                     <p>I too am not unmoved. This diſobedience is, however, blameable, and muſt not be unpuniſhed. If he ſhould perſiſt therein, whatever cauſes it, he cannot poſſibly ſtay here. The intention of a military ſchool is nothing leſs than that the ſcholars ſhould be abſolutely ſubject to the will of their inſtructors.</p>

                     <speaker>The Aſſiſtant.</speaker>
                     <p>His diſmiſſion was indeed the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that I feared; and therefore did I put off ſpeaking of his diſobedience to you. I was every day in hope that his reſolution would be conquered; but it ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>

                     <speaker>The Maſter.</speaker>
                     <p>Is it poſſible, that at his tender age he ſhould be ſo far maſter of himſelf, as to conceal his thoughts from one ſo exerciſed as you are in examining the diſpoſitions of young people?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>The Aſſiſtant.</speaker>
                     <p>He is what you called him juſt now, a true Spartan. His behaviour, though not tinctured with a grain of pride, is perfectly ſeducing. Such is, I may ſay, his manner of concealing what afflicts him, that one cannot but be really aſtoniſhed at his ſilence, and yet not harſh enough to think him obſtinate.</p>

                     <p>I will ſound him then myſelf. The light in which you place his portrait, adds conſiderably to the fair opinion that I formed on my firſt ſeeing him. If I can poſſibly prevail upon him to reveal the cauſe of his

                     <p>He thinks more, I verity believe, of Edward, than himſelf. I have obſerved him ſtudying his actions ſilently.—Then he has never uttered a ſyllable to you about him?</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>No: but I am as well pleaſed with his reſerve as his attention. It proclaims a ſecret ſympathy between him and the youth who has attracted him. You will oblige me by conducting them all three together here this inſtant.</p>

                     <p>This affair is all a myſtery to me! It is very natural that Edward ſhould grieve at being ſeparated from his parents. It is not poſſible but that a boy of ſuch great hopes ſhould be extremely dear to every one who knows him, and have had continual marks of their indulgence; but that nothing ſhould have mitigated his affliction in the period of ten days, ſurrounded by ſo many of his age, and all no doubt deſirous to amuſe him; and ſtill more, that he ſhould wiſh for nothing in the world but bread
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0360400704:119"/>and water, is inexplicable! What the children have to eat is very good, and therefore could not from its quality diſguſt him. Beſides, he was never uſed at home to better fare. His father, at his bringing him to ſchool, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me he was far from rich, and had a numerous family to maintain. The more I think of his behaviour, ſtill the more I think it wonderful! <stage>(He walks about a little while in thought.)</stage>

                     <p>Well then, my ſecond father, I have one at home ſo poor, that he ſubſiſts on ſcarcely better food than bread and water. My poor mother likewiſe is as much reduced as he is; I have two ſiſters, and as many brothers, who enjoy no better fare. And can I then indulge my appetite, and live on your good things, while they have, as it were, no more than bread to moiſten with their tears? No, no; much rather would I die of hunger. I am Edward Barton, and there never was a father of that name who had a ſon unworthy of him.</p>

                     <p>No one, ſir: but he is deſtitute of all things, after having ſerved his country two and twenty years with honour, and conſumed the little that he had left him in ſoliciting a penſion. On the eve of my departure for this place, I heard him read the ſtory of Count Ugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino, who was ſhut up in a caſtle, with his family, to die of hunger. Since that moment, this ſad ſtory has been always in my mind. I think that I hear inceſſantly the pariſh bells a tolling, for the burial of my father, mother, brothers, and poor ſiſters. Can I then make merry, when my heart is overflowed with tears? and eat ſuch food as my afflicted parents cannot purchaſe? If I could, I ſhould no longer be Edward Barton. While my father is unhappy, in whatever corner of the earth I may be, nothing ſhall prevent me from enduring his affliction. If the king—</p>

At ſo great a diſtance from them, he ſupported ſuch privations, though he knew that by doing ſo, he could not ſuccour them. What think you of ſo rare a youth? What think you of a father, who, ſurrounded by misfortunes, has been able thus to form his ſon to virtue? What exalted pleaſure for a monarch to reward ſuch virtue! I am proud, my friend, that I have it in my power to convey to his royal ear, intelligence of this poor youth, and his afflicted father's ſufferings and deſerts. There is but one thing elſe that would yield me greater ſatisfaction. I ſhould like to be in ſuch a ſituation, as to give him an account of all his meritorious ſubjects. I would ſo exalt his throne, that he ſhould then be able to look down on every virtuous man in his dominions, while theſe laſt, by looking up, ſhould ſee him in the action of applauding and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their virtue.

               <p>OH! I'll be revenged, and make him heartily repent it, cried little Philip, while his countenance turned quite red with anger, and he walked along, not ſeeing Emilius, his dear friend, who, at that inſtant, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be coming towards him, and hearing what he ſaid with ſome degree of pain, aſked him, of whom he meant to be revenged? Philip lifted up his eyes; he ſaw his friend, and reaſſumed the ſmile with which his countenance was generally glowing. Ah! ſaid he, come, my friend, and you ſhall ſee of whom I will be revenged. You remember, I believe, my little <hi>ſupple Jack,</hi> that pretty cane my father gave me: ſee, it is all in pieces; the farmer's ſon, that lives at yonder thatched cottage, has broke it. And pray why did he break it? ſaid Emilius. I was walking peaceably along, ſaid Philip, with the greateſt agitation, and was playing with my cane, by putting it quite round my body; one of the two ends, by ſome means or another, got out of my hand when I was oppoſite the gate juſt by the wooden bridge, and where the little blackguard had put down a pitcher full of water, which he was carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home from the well. My cane, in ſpringing, ſtruck the pitcher, overſet but did not break it. He came up cloſe to me, and began to call me names. I ſeriouſly aſſured him that I had not intended to do what I did, and was extremely ſorry for the accident. He would not hear me, but got hold that moment of my <hi>ſupple Jack,</hi> and twiſted it as you may ſee. I will make him, however, heartily repent it; I ſhall ſind a way to be revenged of him.</p>
               <p>He is, indeed, a very ill-natured boy, ſaid Emilius, but is already puniſhed very well for being ſo, ſince every one deteſts and ſhuns him. If he wiſhes to enjoy a little play, he never can have a companion: if he comes where any boys are met to play, they always thruſt him out; but if he will not quit them, they leave him. The hatred of all that know him cannot but ſufficiently avenge you.</p>

               <p>Yes; but he has broke my cane, ſaid Philip. My papa gave it me but very lately; and it was a very pretty one as you know.

                  </gap>; but the bee contrived to ſting him, and flew off in ſafety to the hive. Quite mad with rage, he ſaid, as you did, I will be revenged for this! Accordingly he cut himſelf a ſwitch, thruſt it through the hole into the bee-hive, and turned it about. By theſe means he killed ſeveral of the little creatures; but in an inſtant the whole ſwarm flew all at once upon, and ſtung him in a thouſand different places. You may gueſs how he roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the pain, and how in his agony be tumbled himſelf about upon the ground. His father ran up to him, and could not, without much difficulty, put the bees to flight, by flinging bowls of water on him. He was ill, in conſequence of this, for ſeveral days.</p>
               <p>You ſee then, his vengeance had no very great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>I think, ſaid Philip, you are in the right: ſo come along with me. I will tell my father every thing, and he will not be angry with me, I hope; for look you, I can eaſily take comfort for my broken cane, but not ſhould he imagine that I neglected to take care of what he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0360400704:137"/>gave me. After this, they went together. Philip told his father what had happened. The good gentleman conſoled his ſon, and thanked little Emilius for the advice that he had given him.</p>
               <p>On the day ſucceeding, Philip had another cane, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like the firſt. He paſſed the farmer's houſe: his ſon was at the door, and hung his head, while Philip went along.</p>
               <p>However Philip, ſome days after, ſaw this little pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fall under a heavy log of wood that he was carrying home, and which prevented him from getting up again. Philip ran up to him, took the log from off his ſhoulder. helped him to riſe, and take his load once more upon his ſhoulders. The ill-natured boy was now quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with ſhame at the idea of receiving aid from him whom he had ſerved ſo ill, and heartily repented his behaviour. Philip afterwards went home quite ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. At firſt, he had aſſiſted one whom he did not love, becauſe he could not ſee a fellow-creature ſuffer without relleving him; but afterwards he was rejoiced to think of his behaviour. "This (ſaid Philip) is the nobleſt vengeance. It is impoſſible I ſhould repent thereof."</p>

               <head>CHARLOTTE.</head>
               <p>BEFORE the houſe in which Charlotte's parents li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, you muſt know, there was a little opening, ornamented with a graſs plat, and quite overſhaded with a noble tree, from whence the eye could plainly ſee whatever paſſed along the public road. Miſs Charlotte frequently would come beneath this umbrage with her little chair, and in her hand the ſtocking that ſhe was making for her dear mama, who had inſtructed her to knit. One day, as ſhe was ſitting there, ſhe ſaw a poor old man advancing very ſlowly towards her, on the road: his hair was of a ſilver white, his back was b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt with age, he reſted on a ſtick and ſeemed to walk in pain. Poor man! ſaid Charlottle, looking at him, he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0360400704:138"/>ſeems very much in pain, and perhaps is poor beſides. If ſo then, he is doubly miſerable.</p>
               <p>Further on, ſhe ſaw a company of boys together, who came after the old man. They very quickly reached him. They remarked his thread-bare coat, which was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly long ſkirted, and had ſleeves a deal too ſhort. His hat, quite ruſty, did not eſcape their notice, as the flaps hung down upon his ſhoulders; he had hollow cheeks; and ſeeing him they all burſt out a laughing. As it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, there lay a ſtone upon the ground before him, which he ſtumbled over, and was almoſt down: this ſet them once again a laughing, while the poor old man, for his part, ſighed.</p>
               <p>I once was young as you are, ſaid he to the boys, and did not laugh at the infirmities of ſuch as I am now. You will in time be old yourſelves; and every day you are approaching towards my time of life. You will then be ſenſible of the injuſtice of your ridicule. So ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he went on again, but made a ſecond ſtumble, and in ſtruggling to preſerve himſelf from falling, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his lick. At this, the boys renewed their laugh a third time, crying, let us ſee now, how he will lift it up again?</p>
               <p>Miſs Charlotte, who had heard the old man ſpeak, and was touched with pity for him, ſaw his ſituation, put her ſtocking down upon the chair, ran towards him, took up his ſtick, put it back into his hand, and taking hold of his other arm, as if ſhe had been very ſtrong, exhorted him to lean upon her, and not notice any thing that the boys might ſay. The poor old man looked at her. "Lovely child," ſaid he, "how good you are! I am at once conſoled for all the ridicule with which they treat me. May you be for ever happy!" and ſo ſaying, they walked on together; but the boys no longer followed him as they had done before: perhaps they were aſhamed of their proceeding.</p>
               <p>Some few moments after, one of them fell down him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all the reſt burſt out a laughing as they had done before; for his part, he was very angry, and when up again, ran after his companions, pelting them with ſtones. He was convinced then how unjuſt it is to laugh at any one's diſtreſs: he formed a reſolution never, for the time to come, to laugh at any old man's pain, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0360400704:139"/>at a diſtance him whom he had before made the object of laughter, hoping to have the opportunity of making ſome atonement for his fault.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the good old man, aſſiſted by the friendly aid of Charlotte, went on with flow, but yet ſure ſteps. She offered him the opportunity of ſtopping to repoſe himſelf a little. Do you ſee our houſe, ſaid ſhe? Pray ſtay and ſit a little under that large tree: my parents are neither of them at home; you will on that account be not ſo well entertained; yet ſtill, you will enjoy a little reſt. The poor old man accepted Charlotte's offer. Charlotte brought him out a chair; and then, to hearten up his ſpirits, let him have ſome good ſmall beer and bread and cheeſe. The child had nothing elſe to give.</p>
               <p>Her gueſt could not refrain from thanking her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. "Your parents are ſtill alive?" ſaid he. "They love you; you love them? They cannot therefore but be very happy: may they always be ſo!"—"And you, good old man," ſaid Charlotte, "have you no children?"— "I had once a ſon," ſaid he, "who was ſettled in London: he loved me affectionately, and often came to ſee me; but alas! he is now dead, and I am left without the leaſt degree of conſolation. Indeed, his widow is rich: ſhe takes the lady on her, and imagines it not worth her while to know if I am dead or living, as ſhe wiſhes to forget that her huſband's father is a peaſant. I do not even know her children, which in truth are mine."—He was ſo much affected while he ſpoke theſe words, that tears rolled down his withered cheeks.</p>
               <p>The gentle Charlotte likewiſe was affected, and cried out, Can any one be ſo cruel! Ah! my mother, my dear mother, would not act ſo wickedly. On this, ſhe ſpoke of other matters, that ſhe might not grieve him; when he aroſe, and thanked Charlotte with a bleſſing: but ſhe would not leave him ſo; ſhe meant to go a little way ſtill farther with him.</p>
               <p>On the way, they ſaw the little boy who had been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them; for he had run a great way on before, and now was ſitting on the graſs. He caſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e girl obſerved him, but would not ſpeak of him. She aſked the old man, if he lived alone. No, little lady, anſwered he, I have a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0360400704:140"/>ſee, there it is, beſide you tree acroſs the meadow. You obſerve, it is no great diſtance off: it is in the middle of a little garden. I have an orchard, and a field like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and I told a poor old neighbour, who ſome years ſince left his cottage, which fell down through age, that if he would but come and live with me, he ſhould in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cultivate my ground. I told him, that I would live with him, that he ſhould enjoy whatever I might have, and I would only aſk him to provide me neceſſaries. He agreed. He never had a child: he is extremely good and honeſt; and, for my part, I am quite at eaſe in his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. And yet, in ſpite of all his diligence, at times I think myſelf deſerted. I no longer ſee my ſon, and I was conſtantly accuſtomed to receive from him the tendereſt tokens of affection. In the very place where I have ſeen him run to meet me, I am now aſſiſted only by the hand of ſtrangers. I no longer ſee his children, who have utterly forgot me: I ſhall live far diſtant from them: I ſhall die, and very likely never ſee them more.—Alas! if their poor father were but ſtill living!—He could not utter one word more.</p>
               <p>The gentle Charlotte, touched with theſe complaints, ſaid to him, I will come and ſee you with my mother: we will frequently be with you. But her kindneſs only ſerved to aggravate his grief. The ſenſibility and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the little girl made him recollect of how much conſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation he was utterly deprived; and in returning her his thanks, the tears, which he could not help ſhedding, hindered him from ſeeing where he walked.</p>
               <p>He took his handkerchief to wipe his eyes, and, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by ſad thoughts, inſtead of putting it again into his pocket, let it drop upon the ground, without perceiving what he did; nor did his young companion notice it. The boy however, who was following them, obſerved the whole tranſaction, picked it up, and ran to give it him. "Here, good old man," ſaid he, "you dropped your han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kerchief: it was on the ground."</p>
               <p>Thank you, thank you heartily, my little friend, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the old man. God's providence be praiſed for all things! Here is an honeſt little gentleman, who does not ricicule old age, and laugh at the afflictions that attend it. Oh! no, no; you do not look with ſcorn upon a poor old man. I ſee it in your eyes. You are not of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0360400704:141"/>of thoſe wicked little fellows whom you muſt certainly have paſſed, although you were not with them. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte recollected having ſeen the little boy among them, and remarked his laughing juſt as they did, but ſhe would not ſay a word about it; for although ſhe did not at all approve the boy's behaviour, yet her good nature would not ſuffer her to give him pain, by telling what ſhe knew.</p>
               <p>The little culprit, in the mean time, held down his head, and thought of lying more than once; but he had not been uſed to ſuch a crime. His heart, beſides, was not ſo wicked that he needed to conceal the truth, leſt people ſhould deſpiſe him. "Pardon me," ſaid he; "I was among them, and inſulted you as they did; but am now very ſorry for it. I have found out, ſome time paſt, that when I mix with children of my age, or thereabouts, I am more miſchievous than when alone. Had I been by myſelf, I ſhould never have laughed at your ſtumbling; but, on the contrary, my firſt deſire would certainly have been to help you. I ſhould be very happy to aſſiſt you now, if I could, in order to make amends for my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence."</p>
               <p>"You have already done ſo, my good little friend," ſaid he. You have a deal of candour and good-nature, and will certainly become an honeſt man. I dare believe as much. Come, therefore, both of you to my abode. It is juſt before us; but a few ſteps more, and we ſhall be there. I will let you have ſome milk, and we will drink together."—At this invitation of the good old man, our little boy was very happy. Charlotte would have wiſhed to decline it, but did not, from a fear of grieving him. They reached the habitation: he brought out ſome milk, two porringers, and a loaf of bread a little coarſe, it muſt be owned, but very good. They all ſat down upon the graſs, and made a comfortable meal. "What pleaſure you both give me," ſaid the good old man. "Yes, truly, I am very much delighted upon this occaſion. I have found out two good little friends, who neither ſcorn the poor man, nor the infirm. My <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eep at night will be the ſweeter for it."</p>
               <p>Both the boy and girl, as they ſat beſide him, teſtified their joy and gratitude; but yet their looks were more expreſſive than their words. However, they began to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0360400704:142"/>think of going. Charlotte feared leſt her parents might come home, and be uneaſy at her abſence; and the little man expreſſed how he was grieved ſo ſoon to quit him: but his mother, he feared, would ſcold him, ſhould he think of ſtaying longer.</p>
               <p>"She muſt then be very croſs, this mother that you dread ſo much," ſaid the poor old man.—"Not always," ſaid the little boy. "However, ſhe is ſometimes ſo; and though ſhe loves me, yet I fear her greatly."—"And your father?"—"Oh! I ſcarce knew him: he has been dead theſe four years."—"Dead theſe four years!" interrupted the old man, and fixed his eyes upon the child. "Should it be he?—I have ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me recollection of his features!— Should it be little Francis?"—"Yes, Francis is my name."</p>
               <p>The old man ſtood for ſome few moments motionleſs, and with an altered voice, his eye brim full of tears, and with extended arms, cried out to Francis, "My dear child! you do not recollect your grandfather?—Embrace me!—You have the very features of my ſon. My deareſt child, you no longer thought of me."—Francis tenderly careſſed him, but endeavoured all in vain to ſpeak. Little Charlotte too ſhed tears of joy, to ſee the old man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
               <p>"You ſee him," ſaid the good man, "you ſee him!" He is in reality the living picture of his father. Yes, he is my ſon!—My ſon affectionately loved me, and his ſon will love me too. I ſhall not be ſo wretched as I feared in my old age; nor will the evening of my life be paſſed without ſome joy. I ſhall depart in peace. But I forget that by detaining you, I may ſubject you to your mother's anger: I was ſo much pleaſed, that I forgot that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Depart then, my dear boy! I do not wiſh that my joy ſhould coſt you tears. Depart, and love your mother; be obedient to her, even though you ſhould not come and ſee me. It will be very hard, however, ſhould you quit me now for ever. Come and ſee me, if you can, provided you do not diſobey, or tell a ſtory, to obtain permiſſion."</p>
               <p>Turning then to Charlotte: "And for you, dear little maid," ſaid he, "I am convinced, you ought to leave me, as your parents would be certainly uneaſy, ſhould you ſtay too long. I owe you all my joy, and ſhall for ever
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0360400704:143"/>bleſs you. Come at times, and ſee me. Do not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, my dear children, utterly forget me! May you both be happy!"</p>
               <p>At theſe words the children went away, affectionately holding one another by the hand. They did not ſpeak, but every now and then they looked behind them; while the old man, on his ſide, continued looking conſtantly at them, and did not turn to go into his cottage until they were out of ſight. Little Charlotte got home ſafe. Her parents were not yet returned; however, they came home very ſoon after her. She told them where ſhe had been, and what ſhe had done. It was the ſubject of their even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's converſation.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, they all went to ſee the good old man; and in the ſequel, frequently repeated their kind viſit. Francis likewiſe came to ſee his grandfather, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced to ſee him, to hear him ſpeak, and to receive the moſt affectionate careſſes from him; while, for his part, Francis was as much rejoiced, excepting when he did not ſee his Charlotte: he was then quite ſorrowful, and went home ſad. The more he grew towards manhood, ſtill the more he loved her; and accordingly, when he was old enough to take a wife, he would eſpouſe no other woman, though ſhe was not rich. The old man lived to ſee them married, bleſſed them, and ſoon after died in peace.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0360400704:144"/>beheld her thus dejected, which was but very ſeldom the caſe, he began to be uneaſy, put her on his knee, and taking her affectionately by the hand, enquired what ailed his little child, that ſhe appeared ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly? "Nothing, nothing," anſwered Clara at firſt, to all his queſtions; but at length, on being preſſed more earneſtly to tell him every thing, ſhe replied, that all the little ladies whom ſhe had ſeen that evening at her friend's, where ſhe had been a viſiting, had each received a very pretty preſent from their parents, or elſe friends, by way of fairing; though not one among them was ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in learning as herſelf.

Do you fancy that any reaſonable perſon will eſteem a little lady more, becauſe her father has a great deal of money? You yourſelf, do you eſteem thoſe more who may be richer than you are? When you behold a handſome watch, and are not in the leaſt acquainted with the wearer of it, far from ſaying, "There is a worthy little lady with a pretty watch before her!" do not you rather ſay, "What a charming watch that little lady wears!"—It is plain, that if a watch does honour to any body, it is to the workman; but the wearer of it, if ſhe claims any merit from the poſſeſſion of ſuch a bauble, I ſhould deſpiſe for her vanity.</p>

                  <p>What! that great kettle of a watch, papa! as old, for aught I know, as King Harry the Eighth. The caſe of it would ſerve to hold my little Pompey's break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt of bread and milk.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Ford.</speaker>
                  <p>It is a very good one, I aſſure you; and was all the faſhion at the time it was made, for ſo my father told me. When he died, I found it with the reſt of his effects, and was reſolved to keep it for myſelf. But ſince I put it into your poſſeſſion, I conſider that it will not leave the family; and, as I ſhall often ſee it at your ſide, it will ſtill ſerve to remind me of my father.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; but what will people ſay, who are but ten years younger than my grandpapa would be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent?</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Ford.</speaker>
                  <p>Juſt the thing I expected! You perceive, the motive of utility which you inſiſted on juſt now with ſuch importance, was merely a pretext to hide your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for this ſame watch would do you all the ſervice that you could poſſibly derive from one enriched with dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. Why take up your thoughts with what the world may ſay concerning you? However, in this caſe they will
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0360400704:147"/>applaud your judgment, which could chuſe a watch for real ſervice, not for empty appearance.</p>

                  <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                  <p>But, papa, why hinder me from having ſuch a watch, as will at once be ſtrong, and cut a handſome figure?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Ford.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſuppoſe, then, that would make you happy?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; quite happy.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Ford.</speaker>
                  <p>I could wiſh that my fortune were ſufficient to convince you, by experience, how fallacious is the happineſs proceeding from ſuch trifles. Look ye; I would lay whatever wager you thought proper, that before a fortnight were well over, you would hardly caſt a look upon your watch; that in a month you would forget to wind it up, and very quickly after ceaſe to keep it in a better ſtate of order than your own ideas.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                  <p>Do not talk of wagers, papa! You would be ſure to loſe!</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Ford.</speaker>
                  <p>No, I will not lay; not that I apprehend I ſhould come off the loſer, but becauſe a trial would be neceſſary, which might coſt you dear as long as you live.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                  <p>So then you think, papa, that a handſome watch would only make me miſerable?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Ford.</speaker>
                  <p>Think ſo, Clara? I am ſure it would have that effect; for all our happineſs on earth conſiſts in being ſatisfied with ſuch a ſituation as the will of Providence has meant us. There is no condition in the world ſo humble, or ſo elevated, but a vain ambition in it may induce us to imagine ourſelves in want of every thing that our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour poſſeſſes. It is ambition that torments the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, however eaſy in his circumſtances, and inclines him to behold his neighbour's field with envy, while it ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the maſter of a mighty empire, and perſuades him that ſome province bordering on his realm is wanting to complete the figure of its boundary. Thence ſpring thoſe cruel wars which princes carry on to deſolate their people; and thoſe law-ſuits in which individuals are engaged, or thoſe quarrels that diſgrace man's nature. What were your ideas with regard to that Miſs Richmond that you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned juſt now, when you were looking at the handſome watch that ſhe diſplayed at her ſide? Did you feel within your boſom that alacrity of friendſhip, ſtill ſubſiſting in her favour, which you once cheriſhed? Think, would
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0360400704:148"/>you have done her, at that moment, any ſervice, or at leaſt with equal joy as yeſterday? That ſecret enmity with which her watch inſpired you againſt her, would not ſuch a watch inſpire your friend, or very poſſibly your ſiſters, with the ſame againſt you alſo? Think then, for how deſpicable an enjoyment you would break the deareſt ties of friendſhip and alliance, and the affection which nature plants within us! Who would think herſelf happy upon ſuch conditions?</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Ford.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, my ſweet Clara, entertain no more of theſe unreaſonable wiſhes; they cannot but deſtroy your happineſs. What is there wanting, that you can find really uſeful, in the ſituation which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rovidence allots you? Have you not good food in plenty? and convenient raiment for the various ſeaſons of the year? Does not my love provide you maſters to improve your underſtanding, while I form your heart, and do my utmoſt to endue you with thoſe ſeveral accompliſhments that will in future make you welcome to all decent company? You want, it ſeems, at preſent, a gold watch enriched with diamonds! Should I get you ſuch a watch, how would you look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow upon your falſe pearl ear-rings? Would you leave off teazing me, till I had bought you real pearls? Nor would this be all; for you would then want foreign lace, fine ſilks, and waiting-women to attend you. People cannot go on foot, like others, through the ſtreets, when they are pompouſly ſet out from head to foot; but muſt have footmen, faſhionable carriages, and high-bred horſes. You would want all theſe, and having once obtained them, would be fit indeed to go to operas and aſſemblies, or pay viſits at the houſes of our firſt-rate quality; but to receive them in your turn, you muſt poſſeſs a ſplendid habitation, and give ſumptuous entertainments. Conſider then, if I ſhould ſatisfy your firſt caprice, how many wants would follow! They would every day go on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, till in conſequence of having wiſhed to riſe above your ſtation in one article of luxury, you would, perhaps, come to want the neceſſary things of life. Look round about you, and obſerve how many ſuffer real indigence at preſent, who ſo lately, as I may ſay, as yeſterday, were waſting an eſtate ſufficient for their happineſs. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect what very probably would be your caſe, and that too
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0360400704:149"/>of your ſiſters, if my great affection for you did not, as it does at preſent, turn theſe ſad examples into matters of inſtruction! I have frequently been tired while I was walking through the ſtreets upon my buſineſs. A good carriage would have eaſed my fatigue, as much as it would have flattered my vanity. By allotting to the purchaſe of a coach the money that I lay out on your education, maintenance and amuſements, I might poſſibly be rolling in it for a time; but in the end, what would my fortune be, and yours? I ſhould behold you every day ſink deeper than the day before into ſtupidity, and have no reaſon to expect from you, in my old age, thoſe cares which I had refuſed your childhood. For a few ſhort years, conſumed in all the inſolence of luxury, I ſhould be doomed to languiſh out the remnant of my life in that well merited contempt which a guilty poverty draws after it. With what aſſurance could I think to anſwer at the judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat of God, for the omiſſion of thoſe duties towards you, which the will of Providence impoſes upon every father; when I ſhould have nothing to leave you for your inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance but the ſad example of my guilty conduct? I ſhould then finiſh my life in the convulſions of remorſe, deſpair, and terror; and your curſes might even execrate my aſhes.</p>
                  <p>O! papa, cried Clara, embracing him, how fooliſhly have I been wiſhing! But no watch ſet with diamonds now! On the contrary, if I had one, I would inſtantly return it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ford was rejoiced to ſee his daughter ſo open to reaſon and perſuaſion, and embraced her with the greateſt heart-felt ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>From that happy moment, Clara reſumed her former gaiety; and whenever afterwards ſhe ſaw any of her little friends make boaſt of precious ſtones, or other ornaments about them, was inclined much rather to take pity on their vanity, than to look on them with the ſlighteſt envy.</p>

               <p>THE amiable little Caroline, of whom I have ſpoken once or twice before, went out to Hampſtead for a few weeks with her mama. She had taken ſome new ſhoes for wear during her ſtay there; but by dint of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about in the garden, which was the uſual ſcene of her play, they were all very ſoon out at the toes.

The ſervants went to ſeek for her in the garden, the pleaſure-ground, and all the rooms in the houſe: but no Caroline. The ſhoe-maker, after waiting a conſiderable time, went away; and he had not been gone many minutes, before, all of a ſudden, Miſs Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line made her appearance.</p>

                  <p>It is true, ſhe feeds them regularly: but I need tell you why;—that we may eat them, when they are fat: but the wild geeſe have no fear of this ſort hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over them. As they get food without aſſiſtance, they enjoy the privileges of their freedom: and thus it is too among mankind. He that ſhould without a bluſh rely entirely on the care and forethought of another for his maintenance, would loſe his birth-right, and be forced to ſell himſelf for bread; while he, who on the other hand provides for what he wants, acquires new faculties, and is abundantly ſupported. Not that we ſhould live apart from one another, or be wholly occupied upon ourſelves; for on the contrary, theſe birds, by whoſe behaviour I would have you regulate your conduct, form among themſelves a regular ſociety. They ſit upon the eggs, and nurſe the young ones of ſuch mothers as have loſt their lives by any accident. They likewiſe aid each other in their long and painful flights. They take their ſtation in the front, by turns, to guide the flock, and regulate their flight. Now, Richard, you muſt know, theſe forts of geeſe originally formed but one. Such difference will a different way of life effect in every creature!</p>

                  <speaker>The Poor Woman.</speaker>
                  <p>From Portſmouth, my good lady. I was married to a fiſherman. One night they preſſed him, and he ſerved two years on board a man of war. He came home almoſt dying with the ſcurvy. He had loſt his ſtrength, and could not work. I was obliged to ſell his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0360400704:154"/>nets, that I might buy him phyſic; but his illneſs laſted very long. Our creditors laid hold of every thing that we had; and as we could not pay our debts, our landlord turned us out of doors. A neighbour, very nearly as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed as we were, took us in, and robbed his children of a part of what they had to eat, that we might not be left to periſh. Being brought to ſuch a diſtreſſed ſituation, I fell ill with grief; and ſhortly after, my poor huſband died. As ſoon as I was a little better, I reſolved to be no further burthenſome to my good benefactor, but ſet out to ſeek aſſiſtance from a worthy lady with whom I once lived as ſervant, at Epſom. We are ſtill a great way from it; and I do not know how we ſhall be able to reach it. I am not able to go any farther.</p>

                  <p>He is my father, madam. He has lived a great while with us; and I thought I ſhould have been in circumſtances to have ſtill provided for him, but I am diſappointed in my hopes. Alas! his ſituation adds to my affliction. Having neither ſhoes nor ſtockings, he was walking yeſterday acroſs a common, and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately a thorn run into his foot. I took it out; but his fatigue has grievouſly inflamed the wound: his leg is now quite ſwelled, and he can hardly touch the ground, it gives him ſo much pain; for heaven's ſake, my good lady, have the charity to give me two or three old rags to wrap the wound up when I have waſhed it, and a bit of bread for theſe poor children.</p>

Celia had expreſſed her pity at the tale, by ſhedding tears: Louiſa, by dividing into equal parts among the little ones, a bit of cake that ſhe had provided for her journey, as refreſhment by the way: and Harriet, by relieving her that had the infant, of her burthen, as ſhe ſeemed quite exhauſted.)</stage>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0360400704:155"/>ſomething for their breakfaſt. I will pay a viſit to your father's wardrobe, and get linen, ſhoes, and ſtockings for the poor old man. I am ſorry that I can be of no great ſervice to them.</p>

If then they ſhould be taken ill upon the road?—Mama, you are very charitable to the poor; ſuppoſe you were to let them have a little money that they may go by ſome waggon, and have a trifle over, to ſupply them when they come to Epſom, until they find the lady that they mention?</p>

                  <p>The excurſion that we intend to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, I have promiſed you a long time: it is to recompenſe your good behaviour; and believe me, I have denied my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf this month paſt, many things, that I might ſave as much as it will coſt us; for you know we muſt not only pay for the boat, but when we reach a town, we muſt lay out a little to give Maria, as a preſent, for the expence
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0360400704:156"/>that we put her to in treating us. This money is in my purſe; but I conſider it belongs to you, and leave you to employ it at your pleaſure. Should we add it to your pocket-money, there would be then a ſufficiency to have a cart for theſe poor people, and to procure them victuals until they reach Epſom: but the ſacrifice, I muſt acknowledge, is too great. I dare not recommend it. Our long wiſhed for day's excurſion would be loſt this year.</p>

                  <p>I will tell you why. If we ſhould take this girl into the houſe, we muſt give her cloaths. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go to the expence, unleſs you are willing that I ſhall take a little from <hi>your</hi> dreſs, and make up by that means what it will coſt. And ſo, inſtead of thoſe ſilk ſlips that I meant to give you very ſhortly, you muſt be content with linen gowns, or perhaps ſtuff, and have no feathers or Italian flowers upon your head; nothing but a ribband round your hat.</p>

                  <p>A linen gown will never look ſo well as one of ſilk, will it, pray?</p>

                  <p>But if that will not become me ſo well as ſilk would, the poor girl will cut a much worſe figure in her rags.</p>

                  <p>And then, if ſhe continues thus half uncovered much longer, ſhe may run the riſque of being taken ill, beſides the inconveniences that want of clean cloathing may bring upon her; for you know, mama, you have often told me how unwholeſome dirty cloaths are.</p>

                  <speaker>Louiſa.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! very much, mama. One jumps the better for it. I remember what the <hi>Children's Friend</hi> ſaid lately in the ſtory of poor Matilda, whoſe fine cloaths occaſioned her ſo much anxiety, when ſhe was out a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her little friends and ſought to mortify them with the ſight of her ſilk ſlip, embroidered ſhoes, and frizzled head of hair.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Darley.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then, we are likely, I perceive, to fix on ſomething; and yet this is not the whole.

                  <p>Wait ſome few days, however, till you thank me. You can hardly gueſs what patience you will need to go through the employ. I know you, Harriet; you are ſometimes very haſty; and at firſt you muſt expect that the little girl will hardly comprehend your meaning. You will beat her perhaps; if you do ſo, I ſhall then be forced, againſt my will, to puniſh you. Well, dare you promiſe me that you will never let your peeviſh diſpoſition get the better of you?</p>

                  <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                  <p>I muſt ſay the truth, mama, that is what I cannot promiſe: I ſuppoſe, you recollect the other day when you reproved me. I could then have laid my life that I ſhould never do the ſame again; but you had hardly left the room, when poor Louiſa went to put her ſtockings on, and broke a ſtitch that ran from top to bottom. I had ſo much work to take it up again, I fell into a paſſion, and even beat her. I was quite aſhamed a moment after; but it was done, and could not be mended then.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Darley.</speaker>
                  <p>It is ſingular, indeed, that children who have need themſelves of ſuch indulgence, ſhould have none for others! Truly, you would cut a pretty figure in ſociety if I were never to correct you for this fault.</p>

               <head>MATILDA.</head>
               <p>YOU remember, my dear little friends, the raging heat that made laſt ſummer ſo remarkable. I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, I aſſure you, to my ſorrow; ſince by having an effect upon my health, it hindered me, for many weeks, from ſatisfying your impatience to hear from me. To indemnify you, therefore, for ſo tedious, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing a delay, I ſhall relate an intereſting circumſtance which happened when that heat was at the greateſt.</p>
               <p>I went down to Windſor on a viſit to a lady, who inſtils ſuch excellent principles into her children as juſtify the choice that was made of her mother to ſuperintend the education of a certain auguſt family. We were all engaged in innocent amuſement, when a furious ſtorm began to riſe: the thunder rolled above us with a dreadful noiſe, and ſhook the houſe to its very foundation, while the lightning ſeemed as if it would conſume the dwelling every moment. One young lady of the company could not help being frightened. There were heard cries and ſhrieks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a chamber-maid in one of the apartments. In the midſt of this confuſion, little Matilda diſappeared. Her noble mother, who was paſſing from one chamber to another, ſaw her kneeling in a corner.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>The Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>What are you about there, my dear child?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Matilda.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, nothing, nothing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>The Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>Are you frightened at the ſtorm?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Matilda.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, no, mama. You have inſtructed me yourſelf, if you remember, not to fear the thunder; and you ſaw juſt now I was not in the leaſt afraid.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>The Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>And why then were you kneeling?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Matilda.</speaker>
                  <p>I obſerved Eliza tremble; I heard Kitty cry; and that made me unhappy. I was praying therefore for them, and for every one that is afraid of thunder.</p>

                     <p>You are in the right, my dear Miſs Iſabel; for after all, it bears me witneſs that I have ſeen hot ſervice. If my leg had not been in the fire, it would hardly be ſo dry now. In fact, I know ſome legs, that are, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in their place, becauſe they carried the wearers of them out of danger; and I would not change my wooden leg for twenty ſuch. Young gentlemen, it is happy for you both that you are to ſerve: but take my counſel, and loſe arms as well as legs, much rather than receive the leaſt degree of ſpot in your honour, for want of courage.</p>

                     <p>Becauſe I ſee, by your example, what the fruits of it are. If I am wiſe then, ſhall I ſtudy to make ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of your children, that they may be diſmiſſed, after they have worn themſelves out in the ſervice!</p>

                     <p>But why call my fortune back thus to remembrance, ſince I myſelf have laboured to forget it, and complain no longer of what you ſuppoſe hard uſage.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pipes.</speaker>
                     <p>Pleaſe your honour, then I will complain for both. Bombs and cannons! is it not a ſhame! What, turn me off for having one leg leſs? A ſoldier is always fit for duty, if his heart and his head are left him. If they think that we cripples make no ſhew at a review, why, let them keep us for a battle: we will be put into a corps apart; we won't even condeſcend to mix with others. No affront to your Grenadiers or your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, we will be firſt of all, I warrant you, dear maſter.</p>

                     <p>My old friend, I am pleaſed with your affection; but ſtill I do not like that you ſhould ſpeak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my children as you do. I would not have them think themſelves authorized to hate their fellow-creatures: ſuch a notion would diſcourage them in their purſuit of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and beſides, they are deſtined to acquire themſelves a reputation by their actions. Is it likely that they ſhould take pains for ſuch a purpoſe, if they are told beforehand that men merit only their contempt?</p>

                     <p>And if I ſaved it, I was under obligation to do nothing leſs, my worthy Captain, for your having ſent me to the drill ſo often. Had it not been for your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Pipes would have turned out a vagabond and drunkard, like many others. It was your attention that mace a man of me; I ſhould have been my whole life long a common ſoldier, had you let me grovel on. From rank to rank I have been promoted, and at laſt made ſerjeant; and that is ſomething, every one will grant me! and no inconſiderable lift towards colonel. But a plague upon the muſquet-ball, ſay I, that to my heart of oak has added this deal leg!</p>

                     <p>I ſhall never have repoſe as long as I obſerve your honour ill at eaſe. The produce of your farm, this year, has failed, and I am now become a burthen to you.</p>

                     <p>It would be better far than what the hoſier meant to give me. A fine ſight, indeed! Pipes knitting like a woman! I would ſee his ſtock of knitting-needle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I can work, it is true, ſaid I to myſelf; ſo I went to Mr. Wilkinſon's, and told him that I would furbiſh up his old ſword blades, if he would but employ an ancient ſoldier. He conſented: ſo that I ſhall have the handling ſtill of warlike weapons, and, beſide, receive a ſhilling a day. Let me beg, captain, that you will accept it for my maintenance.</p>

                     <p>I hope their fortune will not be ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, as your motherly affection ſeems to fear; for hitherto, at leaſt, they have no great occaſion to complain of their condition.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Barton.</speaker>
                     <p>What! my dear, when they are utterly deprived of all the advantages that they might reaſonably have expected in life?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt. Barton.</speaker>
                     <p>They never knew them; therefore, never can the want of thoſe advantages afflict them. Poſſibly they might have only ſerved to ſoften and unnerve their ſtrength, as well as underſtanding. The hard life to which they have been uſed, has given them a robuſt and ſound conſtitution, and an energy of mind. Inſtead of purſuing frivolous or puerile amuſements, they already know how to convert their labour into pleaſure. If God's providence ſhould grant them any of the gifts of fortune, they will therefore yield the more enjoyment: but, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they are all decreed to paſs away their days in the privation of this life's conveniences, they will have learnt to undergo their fortune without murmurs or complainings. Shall I tell you what I think, my dear? I do not look on
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0360400704:168"/>the condition to which we are deſtined, as ſo very lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for, ſurrounded by the pleaſures of the world, ſhould we have known thoſe tender ſentiments for each other, which we certainly have learnt, in what men call the ſchool of adverſity? Hurried on by pleaſure, we ſhould each have gone in queſt of friends who would have left us in adverſity, and perhaps aggravated our afflictions by their treachery; while now, afflicted as we are, we are convinced that we have it in our power to make each other happy, by our mutual love and friendſhip. There are many miſerable individuals in the world, who are even deſtitute of bread to eat: we have never experienced ſuch a want, though we have not ſtooped to procure our bread by diſhonour. If, as is the caſe, we are neceſſitated to put up with what may certainly be called a very common diet, that our children may not want for education,—we enjoy, on the other hand, their gratitude, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in knowledge. We are conſcious to ourſelves that we have neglected no one tittle of our duty to them. Every generous notion that they poſſeſs is our work: it is our leſſons and example that have enabled them to poſſeſs it. They will do no laudable or virtuous action in their future lives but what an honeſt pride will permit us to attribute to ourſelves; and granting that any one among them ſhould be raiſed into diſtinction by his merit, I am confident, he will not leave us in old age, when we may more particularly want his ſuccour.</p>

                     <p>On the contrary, dear partner, it is your conſtancy that upholds my fortitude. Without ſupport, I ſhould have long ſince ſank beneath the burthen of my ſorrows; but ſeeing you renounce the delicacies, and ſubdue the weakneſſes inſeparable from your ſex, that you might properly diſcharge your duty, how could I have ſeemed leſs firm than you were, and not have bluſhed at being called a man?</p>

                     <p>Aſcribe not ſo much honour to me, for the ſacrifices that I have made. They muſt be nothing to a mother's ſenſibility: and I would make ſtill greater, if, on ſuch conditions, I might have the proſpect of a happier fortune to befal my children. But, my dear, have you renounced all thoughts of ſoliciting your friends? Are
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0360400704:169"/>you without a hope, that ſuch ſolicitations would be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſucceſs?</p>

                     <speaker>Capt. Barton.</speaker>
                     <p>You know the iſſue of my former appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. If then I experienced nothing but denials, when more recent ſervices ſpoke for me ſhalt I hope a better fortune now? and if the hollow-hearted friend, who then deceived me, would not ſecond my juſt expectations with his influence, who will now eſpouſe the application of a man ſo many years forgot? My very ſilence ſince that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod would be urged as a pretext for new refuſals, and freſh diſappointments but re-open wounds as yet not quite healed up. I have thrown away almoſt my whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence to procure me nothing but vexation; I ſhall therefore hardly be ſo raſh, as to conſume what is left me in ſuch ſteps as, if they failed, would end in deſperation.</p>

                     <p>Yes; though they ſhould coſt me nothing but the time that I muſt purloin from the inſtruction of my children. If I durſt have any hopes, and ſhould again be diſappointed, I am convinced, I could not poſſibly ſurvive; or ſhould, at leaſt, drag on the wretched remnant of my life in ſorrow. No, dear ſpouſe; let us not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thoſe parents, who imagine that they have done enough, in yielding ſome ſmall portion of their ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that too with reluctance, that their children may obtain an education. Let us prove our love, by dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating even our neceſſaries to their wants. Let us conſent to live on bread, if ſuch a ſacrifice be needful, that in future they may ſhew themſelves to have been educated in a manner worthy of us.</p>

                     <p>I have already ſuch a hope concerning Edward. Child although he is, yet I have frequently remarked his depth of underſtanding, openneſs of temper, and ingenuous way of thinking; qualities that I would deſire to find in my friend. He will have two motives for ſeeking advancement, and thoſe ſuch as operate very forcibly on noble minds: he will have obſtacles to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and thereby ſo much the more glory to acquire. With what ardour have I obſerved him, and particularly theſe two years laſt paſt, to reſign himſelf entirely up to ſtudy, and digeſt the greateſt difficulties! With what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0360400704:170"/>has he been ſeized at the recital of ſome glorious action! I have often noted him retiring, as it were in thought, that he might narrowly examine the tranſactions both of Rome and Sparta, and obſerve the infancy of their moſt celebrated heroes. In a ſearch like this, no wonder that the atchievements of a Cyrus ſhould inflame his nature to reſemble him in temperance, fortitude, and reputation. On the whole, I verily believe that nothing but ſome happy circumſtance is wanting, to proclaim him ſuch already, as he may one day ſhew himſelf to be.</p>

For example; I am ſure that, at this very moment, he is thinking to afford me a proof of his affection, by a diligent attention to his ſtudies. Paul, I am ſure his good behaviour will be ſerviceable to your introduction, when the time comes round that you muſt go to ſchool, and have the ſame inſtructor.</p>

And what is more, the elevation of all three may be the happy conſequence of good behaviour in one only; as the bad behaviour of one only may involve the other two, and be a bar to their good fortune. So that you may ſee, on one hand, what diſgrace, and, on the other hand, what honour, may be expected from the turn of your conduct.</p>

               <p>MR. Friendly was one afternoon at home, and in the drawing room with his four children, Lambert, Charlotte, Dorothy and Felix, when three gentlemen whoſe names were Vernon, Fairfield, and Fitzwilliam, came to ſee him. They were Mr. Friendly's oldeſt friends; the children likewiſe loved them greatly, and were very much rejoiced to ſee them. They would always liſten to their converſation with a greedy ear, as being not only inſtructive, but amuſing; and on this particular occaſion ſat with ſuch attention, that they let the night come on without once thinking that they wanted candles. Mr. Vernon was, by this time, relating a very curious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that happened to him in his travels, when a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful noiſe was heard from the ſecond pair of ſtairs. The children crowded together in a fright, behind their father's elbow chair, inſtead of going out and ſeeing what was the matter, as Mr. Friendly thought they would have done. He had bid Lambert, his eldeſt ſon, ſtep out; but Lambert paſſed the order to his ſiſter Charlotte; Charlotte to her younger ſiſter Dorothy; and Dorothy, to Felix.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0360400704:178"/>During theſe negociations, which indeed were all tranſacted in a minute's time, the noiſe continued, and came nearer; but not one among them left his ſtation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Friendly eyed them, with a look which ſeemed to aſk if he, or his friends, ſhould take the trouble to riſe, and ſee what accident had happened?</p>
               <p>Upon this the four began their march together, towards the door, but in the figure of a ſquare battalion, each ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the other. They were now come near the door, when Lambert, with a fearful ſtep, advanced his foot and opened it; but inſtantly fell back into his former place. The little ones, however, were not in the leaſt delivered from their terror, when they ſaw an apparition clothed in white, and crawling on all fours. In ſhort, our <hi>Soſias,</hi> at the ſight, turned tail, and ſetting up a ſhriek, retreated towards their father, who roſe from his ſeat, and going towards the landing-place, cried out, who is there?</p>
               <p>I, ſir, replied a voice, that ſeemed to iſſue from the flooring.</p>
               <p>I, ſaid Mr. Friendly? And pray who are you?</p>
               <p>The barber's boy, ſir, looking for your wig.</p>
               <p>Think, little friends, what burſts of laughter now ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their preceding ſilence. Mr. Friendly rang the bell for light, and when it came, perceived the wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box broken to pieces, and the unfortunate wig entangled about the boy's right foot.</p>
               <p>The tumult of this laughable adventure ſcarce was over, when the father ridiculed the folly of his children, aſking what they had been thus afraid of? They could hardly tell themſelves, as having been accuſtomed from the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not to be afraid at night; and as the ſeveral ſervants in the family were expreſsly forbidden to tell them any fooliſh ſtories about ghoſts or goblins.</p>
               <p>Their preceding converſation being thus deranged, it came at laſt to turn upon this ſubject, and they wiſhed to know what could occaſion thoſe ſurpriſing fears, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all children in darkneſs.</p>
               <p>It is the natural effects of darkneſs, and that only, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Mr. Vernon. As children cannot properly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh objects round them in the dark, their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which is always ſmitten with the marvellous,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0360400704:179"/>ſhapes them out extraordinary figures, by enlarging or contracting what they look at, juſt as circumſtances govern, Upon this, the notion of their weakneſs eaſily perſuades them they are utterly unable to reſiſt thoſe monſters which they think armed to hurt them. Terror thus obtains poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them, and too frequently impreſſes fears which have the worſt of conſequences.</p>
               <p>They would be aſhamed, ſaid Mr. Friendly, if they ſaw, in open day, what often gives them ſo much fright by night.</p>
               <p>It was for all the world, ſaid Lambert, juſt as if I ſaw it: but I needed only touch it, and then I knew very well what it was.</p>
               <p>Oh yes, ſaid Charlotte, you have given us indeed an admirable token of your courage. <hi>Needed only to touch it!</hi> And therefore, I ſuppoſe, you would have let me <hi>touch</hi> the door, but that I puſhed you forward.</p>
               <p>It becomes you well, to talk about my fear, ſaid Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert; you that got behind poor Felix.</p>
               <p>And poor little Dorothy behind me, added the ſly Felix.</p>
               <p>Come, ſaid Mr. Friendly, I can ſee, you have nothing to reproach each other with. But Lambert's notion is not, upon that account, leſs rational; for as in all the monſtrous ſhapes that we image out continually to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we have but natural accidents to fear; we may ward off all danger by the ſenſe of feeling which diſtinguiſhes what frequently deceives the ſight. It is the neglect of this precaution in our infancy, that makes ſo many of us fancy ghoſts in every object round about us. I remember, on this head, a ſtory, comical enough, which I will tell you.</p>
               <p>The four children now came round their father, crying out, a ſtory! oh a ſtory! and their father thus began it.</p>
               <p>In my father's houſe, there lived a maid-ſervant, who one night was ſent for beer into the cellar. We were all ſeated at the table, but could not ſet eyes upon the ſervant or beer. My mother, who was rather of a haſty temper, roſe from table, and went out to call her. As it chanced, the cellar-door was open, but ſhe could not make the ſervant hear. My mother ordered me to bring a candle, and go down into the cellar with her. I went firſt to light the way: but as I looked ſtraight forward,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0360400704:180"/>did not mind my ſteps, and all at once fell over ſomething rather ſoft. My light went out, and getting up, I put my hand upon another hand, quite motionleſs and cold. Upon the cry that I uttered, down came the cook maid, with a candle. She drew near, and we diſcovered the poor girl ſtretched all along upon the ground, face downward, in a ſwoon. We raiſed her up, and let her have a ſmelling bottle. She recovered her ſpirits; but had hardly lifted up her eyes, when ſhe cried out: There! there ſhe is! there ſtill! Who is there? replied my mother. That tall white woman, anſwered ſhe, there hanging in the corner. See! ſee! ſee! We looked the way that ſhe pointed; and in fact did ſee, as ſhe deſcribed it, ſomething white and of a tolerable length ſuſpended in a corner. Is it only <hi>that?</hi> replied the cook-maid, burſting out a laughing. Why that is nothing but a leg of mutton which I bought laſt night. I hung it there, that it might be quite freſh, and cool; and put a napkin round it, to keep off the flies. She ran immediately, took off the napkin, and exhibited the leg of mutton to her fellow-ſervant, who ſtood trembling with fear. It was above a quarter of an hour before ſhe was convinced of her ridiculous miſtake. She would at firſt inſiſt upon it, that the phantom ſtared her in the face with ſaucer eyes; that ſhe had turned to run away but that the ghoſt had followed her, faſtened on her petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, and ſeized upon the candle in her hand. What hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after this ſhe could not tell.</p>
               <p>It is very eaſy to explain all this, ſaid Mr. Vernon; and aſſign the reaſon, why your ſervant fancied thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly. When the fright firſt ſeized her and ſhe ſwooned, the circulation of the blood was ſtopped, and ſhe could not run away; ſhe thought ſhe had been held. Her limbs were deprived of ſtrength, ſo that ſhe could not hold the candle, and therefore ſuppoſed that the ſpectre took it from her.</p>
               <p>We are happy, added he, that the underſtanding and good tenſe of people has begun to diſſipate theſe fooliſh notions concerning ghoſts and goblins. There was once at me of ſo much g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0360400704:181"/>in the country, which is ſtill ſuppoſed to be inhabited by witches, and a train of evil ſpirits. What I am going now to tell you, is a laughable example of it.</p>
               <p>Tom Stubbs, a labouring man, one evening was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a fair, with Edmund and Suſan, his two children. It was towards the end of autumn, when the day ſhuts in betimes.</p>
               <p>Tom going by an ale houſe, told the children that he would enter and refreſh himſelf a little, ordering them, as they were well acquainted with the road before them, to go onward, and in half a dozen minutes he would overtake them. Edmund and Suſan therefore went on ſlowly, talking of the drollery of a puppet-ſhow that they had been ſeeing, and, as well as they were able, talking like the wooden figures in it. All at once, about the middle of a path which paſſing round the corner of a little wood, came, where they ſtood into the public road, their eye was caught by ſomething very bright that ſeemed to dance upon the ground, or riſe and fall by turns. The father having formerly been a ſoldier, had frequently told them that they muſt never be afraid of what by night and at a diſtance might aſſume a frightful figure, but go boldly up to it, when they would find it nothing. Edmund had forgot all this inſtruction. He could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak, he ſhook all over, and perſpired abundantly; whereas his ſiſter laughed to ſee him frightened, ſaying that ſhe would go and ſee the apparition nearer. Edmund all in vain, aſſured her that it was a ghoſt, who certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would twiſt her neck off. She was not diſcouraged by theſe fooliſh notions, but went onward towards the light, without once ſtopping.</p>
               <p>She was come within a dozen yards of it, when, behold ye, ſhe diſcerned the very puppet-ſhow-man who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained her at the fair, and who was ſeeking ſomething with his lantern.</p>
               <p>For in drawing out his handkerchief, his purſe had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; and for upwards of ten minutes, he had looked about to find it on the ground, about the ſpot. Suſan, who had always her wits about her, went and ſearched the hedges, and found it hanging on a ſprig. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gave her, as a recompence, the punchinello which had made her laugh ſo much; and as they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, inſtructed her how to twitch the ſtrings, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0360400704:182"/>to make it play in that diverting manner that ſhe had lately ſeen.</p>
               <p>They were hardly at home, when Tom came in. The puppet-man informed him of what had happened, and extolled Suſan's courage. It was now extremely dark, however, and little Edmund was not to be ſeen. Tom began to fear ſome accident; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took a link, and with Suſan, ran to ſee if he could find him.</p>
               <p>They went very faſt, and hallooed, as they ran, by turns. At laſt they heard, a great way off, the voice of ſome one in diſtreſs. They made up to it, and found Edmund in a ditch, unable to get out. He was quite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a cake of mud from head to foot, and had his face and hands torn ſadly with the brambles.</p>
               <p>How the deuce came you here? ſaid his father, as he helped him out.</p>
               <p>Ah father, I was running with my head turned towards a jack-a-lantern that ran after me, and, as I could not ſee my way before me, I tumbled in here. I wanted to get out, but could find only brambles to lay hold of. See how they have ſcratched my face and hands; and thereupon he began his cries and lamentations afreſh.</p>
               <p>Tom reproved him very roughly for his cowardice; but Edmund was a deal more vexed when told his ſiſter's luck. He could not be conſoled for having loſt his ſhare in the diverting punchinello which ſhe knew, by this time, how to play off with great dexterity.</p>
               <p>The lantern, in your tale, ſaid Mr. Fairfield, makes me recollect a ſingular adventure with a lantern in it, that performed its part ſo well, as to affright, not merely ſuch a little peaſant as your Edmund, but a whole village.</p>
               <p>I was coming home one night on horſe-back, from a viſit that I had juſt before been making to a number of the neighbouring villages, where I had quartered my recruits. There had fallen a great deal of rain that day, ſince noon, and during all the evening, which had broken up the road, and it was raining ſtill with equal violence; but being forced to join my Company the next morning, I ſet out, provided with a lantern, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to paſs a narrow defile between two mountains.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0360400704:183"/>I had cleared it, when a guſt of wind took off my hat, and carried it ſo far that I deſpaired of recovering it again, and therefore gave the matter up. By great good fortune I had on me a large ſcarlet cloak. I covered up my head and ſhoulders with it, leaving nothing but a little hole to ſee my way and breathe through; and for fear the wind ſhould take a fancy to my cloak, as well as hat, I paſſed my right arm round my body to ſecure it, ſo that riding on in this poſition, you may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that my lantern, which I held in my right hand, was under my left ſhoulder. At the entrance of a village, on a hill, I met three travellers, who no ſooner ſaw me, than they ran away, as if they were poſſeſt. For my part, I went on upon the gallop, and when come into the town, alighted at an inn, where I deſigned to reſt myſelf a little; but ſoon after who ſhould enter but my three poltroons, as pale as death itſelf. They told the landlord and his people, trembling as they ſpoke, that on the road they had encountered a great figure of a man all over blood, whoſe head was like a flame of fire, and to increaſe the wonder, placed beneath his ſhoulder. He was mounted on a dreadful horſe, ſaid they, quite black before, and grey behind, which, notwithſtanding it was lame, he ſpurred and whipped right up the mountain with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſwiftneſs. Here they ended their relation. They had taken care to ſpread the alarm as they were flying from this wondrous apparition, and the people had come with them to the inn in ſuch a drove, that upwards of a hundred were all ſqueezed together, opening their mouths and ears at this tremendous ſtory. To make up in ſome ſort for my diſmal journey, I reſolved to laugh a little and be merry at their coſt, intending at the ſame time to cure them of ſuch frights, by ſhowing them their folly in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. With this view I mounted my horſe again behind the inn, went round about till I had rode the diſtance of half a mile; when turning I diſpoſed of my accoutrements, that is to ſay, my clock and lantern, as before, and on I came upon a gallop towards the inn. You ſhould have ſeen the frighted mob of peaſants how they hid their faces at the ſight and crowded into the paſſage. There was no one but the hoſt that had courage to remain and keep his eye upon me. I was now before the door, on which I ſhifted the poſition of my lantern, let my cloak
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0360400704:184"/>drop down upon my ſhoulders, and appeared the ſame figure as he had ſeen me by his kitchen fire. It was not without real difficulty that we could bring the ſimple people who had crowded in for ſafety from their terror: the three travellers in particular, as the firſt impreſſion was ſtill ſtrong within them, could not credit what they ſaw. We finiſhed by a hearty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ugh at their expence, and drinking to the man whoſe head was like a flame of fire and placed beneath his ſhoulder. This was what I meant to tell you, and perhaps if ſuch conviction of their ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs apprehenſions had not been afforded them, the ſtory of my ſtrange appearance would have paſſed from one old woman to another, and for centuries occaſioned mortal fears through all the country.</p>
               <p>It depended only on me too, in the ſame manner, ſaid Mr. Fitzwilliam, to afford the ſubject of a fine ſtory to the goſſips of my county, in an adventure that beſel me one night, about the time of my leaving ſchool.</p>
               <p>I was come home at Midſummer, and had received an invitation from my uncle, to be with him for a month or thereabouts. While I was there, I had occaſion to get up one night, or rather morning. I was obliged to paſs along a gallery, and had nothing but the moon to guide my ſteps, and ſhe was very much obſcured by clouds. In going by a window which opened to the garden, I ſaw a monſtrous figure, moving at a little diſtance from the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery where I was. The moon, which caſt a faint light on the monſter, gave it an appearance rather frightful. It was like a great Coloſſus, with the upper part inclining forwards. As it went away I ſaw it by degrees diminiſh. All at once, however, it appeared to come in two. One half ſeemed motionleſs and dead, the other greatly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; but as neither of the two approached me, in the fear that ſeized me I had ſtrength enough to bawl out help! help! help! I had but time to utter theſe three words, before the living half of the phantom ran up to the gallery where I was, and in a ſuppliant accent, ſaid to me, ah maſter Charles, do not cry out for heaven's ſake. I remembered, as I thought, the voice; and therefore taking courage went up boldly to it, crying out who are you? Some houſebreaker doubtleſs.—No, no, maſter, I am Sam the coachman. Sam the coachman! anſwered I; and what are you about at ſuch an hour as
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0360400704:185"/>this? I followed him, for he was now gone from me, and perceived a ſack of ſomething placed againſt the wall. I now ſaw clearly what had given him ſo monſtrous an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and why he ſeemed to come in two, when he had thrown the ſack off his ſhoulders. I demanded what the ſack had in it. I am going, anſwered he, betimes to town. Laſt night I quite forgot to bring my horſes their ſupply of oats, and they muſt eat before they leave the ſtable. So I roſe to get it; but pray do not ſpeak a word about it in the houſe, I beg you: they might think me very careleſs, and perhaps a thief. It came into my head, upon the ſpot, that he might in fact be what he ſeemed afraid of being thought. I had myſelf the night before, I remembered, met him with a ſack of oats upon his back. Beſides, it was not towards the ſtable that he was going; he was very near a little door which opened at the bottom of the garden towards a lane; and beſides, I thought two ſacks of oats were more a great deal than three horſes, for my uncle had but three, could want. At breakfaſt I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed my uncle of this buſineſs. After ſome examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was found that the coachman had a falſe key in his poſſeſſion, by means of which he had at different times purloined the corn intended for the horſes.</p>
               <p>Now, if when the phantom had approached, and called me by my name, I had not overcome my firſt fright, but run away to ſhun him, with what terrible ideas ſhould I have been poſſeſſed all night? The idea of this monſter might, perhaps, have accompanied me my whole life, and rendered me a coward, if it had not touched my brain, and robbed me of my underſtanding.</p>
               <p>In effect, this apprehenſion of Mr. Fitzwilliam's was by no means groundleſs. I have myſelf been very lately told of an unhappy incident, which ſhows how terrible the effects of fear may be on children. I will tell it you at length, my little friends, and I hope, the ſtory will not fail to cure you of a wiſh to frighten one another when it is dark, if ever you give way to ſuch a practice.</p>
               <p>Charles Pomeroy, a child of great vivacity and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, had adopted ſuch a turn towards muſic, that beſides his daily leſſon on the organ, which his maſter came to give him every morning, he would go at night upon a viſit to his maſter, who reſided in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and there repeat it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0360400704:186"/>Charles's brother Auguſtus was a good boy likewiſe, but had ſomething of a turn towards drollery; and ſpent the time, when Charles was at his book, in ſcheming how he might play off ſome trick or other, no ways mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who became the object of his waggery. He took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that his brother frequently came home alone, and ſometimes when it was dark, and turned his thoughts upon a contrivance to frighten him a little. He could walk in ſtilts. One evening, therefore, at the time that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was expected home, he put himſelf into a pair of very high ones, wrapped a great white ſheet about him, which trailed far behind upon the ground; and took a broad brimmed hat, which firſt of all he flapped, and having covered it with crape, of a ſufficient length to hang a great way down on every ſide, but moſt of all before him, put it on his head. Thus frightfully equipped, he placed himſelf upright, and at a little diſtance from the houſe, cloſe by the garden-gate, through which his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther always entered coming home. This laſt was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in the innocent delight peculiar to a child, and humming to himſelf the tune that he had been playing. He was ſcarce come within a dozen paces of the gate, when he perceived the vaſt Coloſſus, which held out its arms, advancing to attack him. Agitated with a mortal fright, at ſuch an apparition, he fell down upon the ground, deprived of underſtanding. Poor Auguſtus, who had not foreſeen the conſequences of his fatal frolic, threw away his maſk immediately, and fell upon his brother's almoſt breathleſs body; and did everything in his power to reanimate him: but alas! the unhappy little fellow, as he found, was every thing but abſolutely dead. His parents inſtantly came running to the ſpot, and with a great deal of difficulty brought him back to life. He opened his eyes, and viewed them with a vacant ſtupid look. They called him by every tender name; but he appeared as if he did not comprehend them. He endeavoured, but in vain, to ſpeak: his tongue eſſayed to do ſo, but without articulation. He is now deaf, dumb and fooliſh, and will very probably remain ſo all his life-time. Six or ſeven months have paſſed, ſince this deplorable occurrence, and the doctors who attend him have, as yet, done nothing towards his cure. Imagine little friends, if you are able, the diſtreſs and ſorrow of his parents. It would certainly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0360400704:187"/>have been better, both for them and him too, had he died upon the ſpot. They would not then have every day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them ſuch a piteous object of affliction and deſpair. But their diſtreſs is nothing in compariſon to Auguſtus's. Since the unhappy accident, he has been like a ſkeleton, much more than a human creature. He can neither eat nor ſleep. His tears exhauſt him. Twenty times a day he walks about the room, and ſuddenly ſtops ſhort: he wrings his hands, pulls up his hair, and curſes even his birth. He calls and embraces his dear brother, who no longer knows him. I have ſeen them both, and cannot tell which of the two is moſt unhappy.</p>

               <head>BACKGAMMON.</head>
               <p>MR. Parker had been buying, for his children, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony and Sylvia, what they call a draft-board, and backgammon table at the back, with thirty men, two red Morocco boxes, and a pair of dice.</p>
               <p>The children did not know, as yet, both games; they were a little ſkilled in drafts; but then backgammon was all Greek or Hebrew to them; ſo they begged their dear papa to give them ſome inſtruction in it. Mr. Parker, who was always ready to make one in their diverſions, undertook the taſk with pleaſure; and by turns, ſat down with both, while he that was not in the game, looked on for improvement.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not detain you with deſcribing how they reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the pips upon the dice when they had thrown them, by the aſſiſtance of their fingers; or the blunders that they were every minute making. I chuſe rather to inform you, that in little better than a month, they underſtood back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gammon tolerably well; and could ſit down and play with one another. Sylvia bent her ſtudy to ſecure the hit; but Anthony, much more ambitious, would be ſatisfied with nothing but the gammon.</p>
               <p>Their papa, one day, ſtood by, while they were play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—After ſome bad throws, Anthony loſt all temper, and his moves of courſe were very injudicious; but his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0360400704:188"/>ſiſter, who was calm and ſteady, carried every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her.</p>
               <p>Anthony, like other players, while he ſhook the dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box, did not fall to name the points that he wanted, either to fill up his table, or defeat his adverſary. <hi>Cinq</hi> and <hi>quatre,</hi> dried ne! <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>trey!</hi> but no: they would not come; and it was always deuce and ace, or double treys, or ſomething to the full as bad, that turned up in their ſtead. He ſtamped upon the ground, or when he threw the dice, was ſo outrageous, as to fling the dice-box after, crying out, Was ever any thing ſo croſs-grained and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky? one would think the matter were contrived to ſpite me!</p>
               <p>Sylvia, on the other hand, when ſhe, in throwing, called for ſuch a number as ſhe wanted, and was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, far from giving way to uſeleſs lamentation, thought within herſelf what <hi>move</hi> would be the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, after her bad throw; and frequently her father was ſurpriſed to ſee how ſhe would make amends for want of luck, and in an inſtant, as it were, recover, when he thought her on the point of being worſted.</p>
               <p>And whenever victory declared for her with all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of a triumph, ſhe would conſtantly and modeſtly avoid the glory of her conqueſt; while poor Anthony, aſhamed of being beaten, durſt not lift his eyes up. Upon one of theſe occaſions, when his father had been ſtanding by, and noticed his bad playing, he addreſſed him to the following purport: Anthony, you have richly merited to loſe this game.</p>

                  <p>I am aſhamed, on your account, to ſee you have recourſe to ſuch poor ſhifts as little minds employ, when they reſolve before hand to ſupport their cauſe; for tell me, have you really diſcerned in my compariſon any thing that hinders it from having a relation to the ſubject of which we are ſpeaking?</p>

                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>To ſay the truth then, no. I did not once think of it. I was only anxious to avoid the appearances of being worſted in the argument.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Parker.</speaker>
                  <p>You may ſee, then, what you get by ſuch evaſions. You were only to be blamed for wanting judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and you added inſtantly thereto what is much more to be condemned, a want of juſtice. By uſing ſuch a pitiful ſubterfuge againſt an adverſary of common ſenſe, do you think that he will become its dupe, and yield you up the conqueſt? Never. He will ſee the folly of it firſt, and afterwards the meanneſs. You will find, you might have been entitled to his pity, but will meet with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and not <hi>his</hi> only, but your own.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Parker.</speaker>
                  <p>You are ſenſible that I never ſpare reproof, when I ſee any thing that leads, however round-about, to meanneſs or injuſtice. Such a leſſon you will get from no one but your father; and I give it you from motives of affection, that another may not have occaſion to beſtow it on you from moroſeneſs. The confeſſion which you firſt made me, of not having once conſidered what you ſpoke, and which only could proceed from an ingenuous turn of mind, perſuades me that you will never want another leſſon of the kind.—Embrace me, my dear fellow.</p>

                  <p>I can hit upon no other way of doing ſo, than this of giving you inſtruction; but at preſent, let us
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0360400704:190"/>come to the compariſon that I inſtanced; and I hope we ſhall be no leſs able to derive improvement from it, than illuſtrate what we were ſpeaking of before.</p>

                  <p>Let us ſee then, papa: I promiſe I will not ſeek to contradict you: but, provided I obſerve it vary in the leaſt from what you meant it to explain, you give me leave in that caſe—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Parker.</speaker>
                  <p>I deſire no gentler treatment. I ſhall be rejoiced to have you give me juſter notions; for believe me, when I tell you, that a rational ſelf-love finds ſatisfaction, even in confeſſing its miſtakes. Self-love, if rational, has always an unfeigned reſpect for truth, a veneration for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal or mutual juſtice; and that reaſon, which can ſpring thus nobly from its fall, is in the way of never ſtumbling.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah papa! I ſee, I muſt this long while keep a tight rein on mine.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Parker.</speaker>
                  <p>You muſt; but looſen <hi>that</hi> at leaſt of your imagination, ſo that you may follow while I ſhow the way. I told you, that a player at backgammon ſhould purſue the conduct of a ſkilful gardener in his garden. If the one endeavours to procure his tree a handſome looking trunk, and make ſuch diſpoſition of the branches, as may get him the moſt frait, the other is employed in bringing up his men in ſuch a manner, that whatever points he throws, he may be able to fill up his tables, more or leſs. Thoſe points depend no more upon the one, than the variety of ſeaſons on the other; but what equally depends on both, is this: that they ſhould be upon their guard, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe uncertainties, and not expoſe the object for which they are labouring, without precaution on their part. The order of a game has many favourable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable turns, as has the order of the ſeaſons many beneficial and malignant influences. Now the lucky chances, I may ſay, have a reſemblance to thoſe kindly heats which introduce fertility; and the unlucky to thoſe nipping winds in ſummer, that are obſtacles to vegetation. The great point is to foreſee theſe changes. He that plays, is with diſcretion to run ſome few riſques, when nothing need be feared from his adverſary, but to ſtand upon his guard whenever he is in force; and he that plants is to expoſe his tree, that it may have the beneficial influence of the ſun, when all the elements are mixed in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0360400704:191"/>kindly union; but to defend it when the weather happens to grow ſtormy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>Very well, papa; things hitherto ſquare mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly well: but at backgammon, a good player, you are ſenſible, not only profits by his own dexterity, but is the better for his adverſary's want of judgment, and the faults that he makes; whereas the gardener, if he plays a game, muſt play it by himſelf in your compariſon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Parker.</speaker>
                  <p>True, Anthony; but you muſt not expect that a compariſon will take in every object and relation: mine is limited to thoſe I have mentioned.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you think ſo? Well then, I will proceed a little further with it, if you pleaſe, papa. I look on all the gardeners of the village, as if playing with each other, to determine which ſhall bring the beſt and greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of fruit to market. He that plays moſt ſkilfully, will do ſo; and of courſe diſpoſe of it at higher prices, if the reſt, through ignorance and inattention, ſhall have leſs or worſe to ſell; and conſequently he will win the game.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Parker.</speaker>
                  <p>Well argued, Anthony! You now ſee, I hope, what advantages one may derive from entering into rational debate, where neither party ſeeks to lay a ſnare to catch the other, and to ſatisfy his miſerable vanity, but where both wiſh to give reciprocal inſtruction, by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of what they know reſpectively. I only ſaw one face belonging to the object which I exhibited to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; but exciting your attention towards it, I have furniſhed you with the occaſion of diſcovering one that had eſcaped me, and which very likely may enable me, in my turn, to diſcern ſome other that it may ſtill poſſeſs. Men have obtained no ſort of knowledge otherwiſe than by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling and comparing thoſe ideas with which meditation has ſupplied them, in cultivating any branch of ſcience. I compare them to as many lamps, that ſhould be placed to burn before reflectors of a thouſand different ſurfaces, but every one reverberating to a common center. It is the bundle of theſe rays, ſome far more brilliant than the reſt indeed, but ſtrengthened all by one another, that makes up that glare of light collected in the focus of their union. I ſhall really be glad, if you inure yourſelf betimes, Anthony, to conſider all the objects of which you would judge, by comparing them with others that already are familiar to your underſtanding; by contraſing them with
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0360400704:192"/>one another, and remarking, in this contraſt, every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance by which they may reſemble, or be foreign to each other. This ſame method is moſt natural and ſure. It is a method which <hi>they</hi> have followed, who, by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing their imagination, have attained to the ſublimity and pathos of a Homer, a Voltaire, a Milton; who, by ſtudying the affections of the human heart, have made themſelves a Sophocles, a Moliere, or a Shakeſpeare; who, by riſing to the origin of our ideas, have become a Condillac, or Locke; who, by inveſtigating nature, have acquired the praiſes of an Ariſtotle, a Buffon, an Edwards; who, by mecitating on the title to give law, and form <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>You may well remember, there was once a time when Ifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ncerely loved you, and when you yourſelf appeared to merit my affection. Now that time is paſt. You have found out an object worthier of your love than I am. Since you act from the idea of promoting your felicity by ſuch a preference, I do not wiſh to thwart you.—We are free.—Do you retire where you think fit, while I live where I pleaſe; and that is here. I grant you a week's time to make your choice. I go away to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhall ſtay from home till Monday next, that you may not be incommoded with my preſence, or endure that trouble, of which it does not ſuit me in the leaſt to be a witneſs. Reſpecting our three children, you may be at peace on their account. Their mother, after her beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, muſt no longer have the leaſt communication with them; and whenever I think fit to make enquiry, I ſhall find ſome governeſs who will not be wholly unqualified to bring them up according to their birth. Receive for ever my adieu. Enjoy in peace your new condition, and endeavour, as much as you can, to blot out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that man, who formerly was proud to ſubſcribe himſelf your loving huſband, but is now no more than, &amp;c.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Should in vain endeavour to deſcribe the different emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions raiſed within my ſoul, by the peruſal of your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. You reſolve that a ſeparation ſhall take place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. Since you judge an open rupture needful, I ſubmit to your good pleaſure. If when we were firſt united, any one had told me that all our mutual vows would come to this, I ſhould certainly not have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that ſuch an event was poſſible. Nevertheleſs it has taken place. In my misfortunes however I have ſtill one conſolation left me; namely that in heaven there is a God, who has the means of manifeſting innocence. My conſcience clears me of reproach. My heart has no idea of an object worthier of me, as you ſay, than you are. It has always been devoted to you only. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt all this, not making uſe of oaths, but by a ſimple affirmation which my heart pronounces with aſſurance. I will make no effort to convince you of my innocence, and your injuſtice. I ſhall patiently purſue the path which God's providence points out for me. God's providence, I ſay, which hitherto has heaped its bleſſings on me; and, I hope, will ſtill continue ſo to do. It is a cruel ſtep, ſir, to take all my children from me. I may think, the mother who firſt gave them life in anguiſh, has a greater title to them than a father; and the laws would grant me the ſociety of one, at leaſt: but do not imagine that I have ſuch a doubt of your paternal tenderneſs and wiſh to make them happy, as to have recourſe to legal aid againſt you. I will figure to myſelf with reſignation, that God's will by death, has torn them from me, or that I myſelf am dead, and ſhall be very quickly followed by them. Farewel, and be at all times happy, moſt unjuſt, yet deareſt huſband. Every night and morning I will pray to God that, for your own repoſe, he may remove the miſt of error from before

                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear and Worthy FRIEND,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Send you my three girls, and earneſtly conjure you to beſtow your tendereſt care upon them, ſo that they may find a ſecond mother in you. After the deplorable event that has deprived them of the mother who firſt gave them life, I look upon it as a ſpecial bleſſing that your ladyſhip ſo generouſly condeſcends to ſuperintend their education. I am ſenſible how great a burthen I wiſh you to undertake, and how utterly unabled ſhall ever be to ſhew my gratitude for ſuch a favour. But then what will not a father dare to do for his children? Condeſcend, therefore my deareſt Madam, upon that account, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my paternal indiſcretion, and diſpoſe for ever both of me and every thing belonging to me. There is one particular that I cannot ſufficiently recommend to your attention; namely, the ſelection of a proper governeſs. Endeavour to ſecure them one according to your principles and mine. There are ſo few, Madam, fit for any thing but dreſſing and undreſſing dolls! and rather than deliver up my children to ſuch creatures, I would leave them in a wilderneſs, to vegetate, without receiving any educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as ſouls that afterwards prove worthy of each other, have a ſort of reciprocal attraction, by a ſecret ſympathy ſubſiſting in them, I am not without the hope that in ſo elegant a place as Bath, you will at leaſt be able to procure ſome woman of a ſuitable behaviour, with ſenſe ſufficient, and knowledge to bring up my children as I wiſh. I beg that you would ſuppoſe yourſelf at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to enter into any terms with ſuch a one as you yourſelf think proper, ſince I mean to ſpare no coſt upon a point of ſuch importance. I am quite impatient for a letter from you. It would highly pleaſe me, if your ladyſhip would charge my eldeſt daughter Harriet with ſome part of the correſpondence that will be between us; as by ſuch means, ſhe will come herſelf to write correctly betimes, and to expreſs herſelf with ſome degree of eaſe. It is in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0360400704:205"/>your power to render more ſupportable the great misfortune that I have undergone, and to give me in my children all the joy of which their mother has deprived me. In reality, I cheriſh ſuch a hope within me, to drive out the uneaſineſs that otherwiſe would overwhelm me; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe myſelf, with every ſentiment of gratitude, eſteem and friendſhip,</p>

                     <p>You have not deſerved it, my poor Jenny. You have, at all times, been a dutiful girl, and if, hereafter, Providence ſhould otherwiſe diſpoſe my lot, I will have none but you to wait upon me. But at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it is impoſſible that you ſhould continue with me any longer. We muſt abſolutely part. Be comforted it will not, I perſuade myſelf, be long before I have you back. I would, till then, have given you wherewithal to live, but that I fear the danger that might threaten your
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0360400704:206"/>youth and inexperience. You will be, with Lady Harbord, no leſs happy than you were with me, as I have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended you to her protection in a very earneſt manner. Take this little preſent as a token of remembrance; there is likewiſe in the bottom drawer of my bureau, a quantity of clothes and linen which I give you. Go, my poor dear Jeany, and do not cry before me thus. My eyes are full enough of tears already. Go; and, when you have put all your things together, I will ſee you once more.</p>

                     <salute>Dear papa,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE ſo many things to write to you, that I cannot tell with which I ſhould begin my letter. We are now no longer at Mrs. Villars's, but have removed to Mrs. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0360400704:213"/>our governeſs's houſe; it is in the Circus, and a very pleaſant ſituation. You cannot poſſibly conceive how happy we are all of us in being with her. She is ſuch a charming woman! quite as kind as our mama! She loves us juſt as if we were her children, and we love her alſo juſt as if ſhe were our mother! There is no need of laying out your money to have maſters come and teach us; ſhe herſelf knows every thing that we ought to learn. You would imagine that ſhe conſidered it her happineſs to teach us; and ſhe does it in ſo kind a way, that we are all delighted with inſtruction at her hands. Sophia and little Caroline already read quite charmingly, ſo much attention Mrs. Lambert has paid them! As for me, I have begun a courſe of geography and hiſtory with her: this, together with a little cyphering, and a few choice pieces both in verſe and proſe, which I take care to learn by heart, employs our morning. In the afternoon, for recreation ſake, I go to drawing, dancing, and the harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicord; and when the evening comes, ſit down and take my needle, at the uſe of which you cannot imagine how clever Mrs. Lambert is: and laſtly, to complete myſelf in cyphering, and acquire a little knowledge of the expences of a houſe, ſhe gives me all the bills to overlook, and makes me ſet down every little ſum of money that ſhe lays out. By theſe means I begin to know the price of many things, and, as ſhe tells me, may become your little ſtewardeſs when I return. With ſo much on my hands to do all day, you will perhaps, imagine that I am tired at night; not at all, papa. I am happy, on the contrary, to think that I have ſo well filled up my time, and ſhould have reaſon to complain, if any one deprived me of ſuch charming occupations.</p>
                  <p>I have put a little trick on Mrs. Lambert, and mean to tell you what it is. She went the other day with Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line to viſit Mrs. Villars, and left me at home to keep Sophia company. I thought it would divert her if I read a little; ſo I took a book that we have, called the Theatre of Education, from the French, and read the <hi>Poor Blind Woman.</hi> I could not refrain from crying very much; but, to my great ſurpriſe, Sophia did not. This quite vexed me, as you may eaſily imagine; upon which I pinched her, that ſhe might cry and keep me company. She cried indeed, and more a great deal than I wanted
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0360400704:214"/>her to do. At laſt however I appeaſed her, after many kiſſes and careſſes, but was angry with myſelf for having hurt her. I ſuppoſe, ſome object took off her attention while I read, and naturally thought that ſhe would be really affected, could ſhe read the piece herſelf: with this idea in my head, I formed a plan of putting her to con this charming piece in private, till ſhe could read it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; and Mrs. Lambert could not refrain laſt night from wondering at the progreſs that ſhe had made. We did not let her know our ſecret, but propoſe to catch her ſo again with Caroline. I am quite rejoiced that we can have theſe opportunities of pleaſing her, for all the trouble that ſhe is every moment taking upon our account.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, dear papa, are our amuſements and our ſtudies here; to which if you add our walks about the place, our viſits to a few poor people near us, whom we now and then aſſiſt with old clothes and money, and our labours in a little garden, where we tend our flowers, you will have the hiſtory of our times at large. We never were ſo well in health as now, and never in our lives ſo happy; we want nothing but the pleaſure of your company. If you would only take a little journey down to Bath, I would give every thing in the world that you might ſee this Mrs. Lambert. I am ſure, no woman breathing would prove worthier of your friendſhip. Oh! come, come papa!</p>
                  <p>But you muſt know, I have Caroline at preſent at my elbow, and ſhe aſks me if I am writing to you. She is ſo proud of having ſcrawled theſe few days paſt what ſhe calls letters, in a copy-book that Mrs. Lambert has made her, that ſhe ſays ſhe too will ſcribble you a line or two. It will be a charming hodge-podge, I foreſee, of great and little letters, and fine ſpelling, if ſhe ſets about it; but no matter, I muſt pleaſe her. She has got a pen, in hand already, and is groping in the ſtandiſh for ink. She is tugging me this very moment by the apron to leave off, and give her up my ſeat. Adieu then, dear papa. My governeſs deſires me to preſent you her reſpects. Sophia's duty to you, and mine alſo. I am, &amp;c.</p>

In reality, I wiſh to have it go before-hand, and in ſome ſort ſpare my tongue the ſhame and trouble of revealing what it is to tell you. Shall I even have ſufficient courage thus to let you know my ſituation? but the caſe is urgent; and beſides, I merit my humiliation. Well then, know,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0360400704:216"/>madam, I have ſhewn myſelf the moſt unjuſt and cruel of all huſbands! I have dared to diſparage the unſpotted virtue of my Amelia with my ſcandalous ſuſpicions; of my Amelia, I repeat, whoſe very looks I am unworthy now to meet. It was when I moſt inſulted her that ſhe was moſt ſtudious to preſerve my name from ignominy. One of my relations, a young man whom I patronized, was on the point of being utterly diſgraced among his brother officers, for certain youthful levities which he durſt not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to me, acquainted as he was with my impatient tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. It was ſhe who, with the fruits of her oeconomy, delivered him from the diſhonour that he was going to bring both upon himſelf and me. She had ſufficient ſtrength of mind to bear with my unworthy treatment and aſperſions, rather than expoſe him to my indignation by revealing his delinquency. I have diſcovered very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently this motive for thoſe ſecret interviews that ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed my mind, and cannot keep from curſing my deteſted jealouſy. But how ſhall I endure her preſence? At her feet, and without daring to look up, I will implore her pardon. I am poſting to that quarter where ſhe has fixed her retirement: fortunately I muſt paſs through Bath to reach it. I ſhall ſee you by the way, and kiſs my almoſt orphan little ones. Farewel! I dare not ſign a name which my jealouſy has made ſo criminal.</p>

                  <p>INSTEAD of ſeeing me, or any of the children, you will have a letter full of tears and lamentation. On the day after your departure, Harriet and Sophia all at once complained of being feveriſh, and were attacked with ſuch a head-ache that they could not poſſibly keep up. We put them, therefore, inſtantly to bed. Towards evening, Caroline made juſt the ſame complaint. All three are now covered quite over with a very thick ſmall-pox of ſuch a ſort as I am told is very virulent. I muſt forget that I never had this dreadful malady myſelf. All night, as well as day, I keep my ſituation by their bed, and every moment fear they will be ſuffocated. I have felt already, in myſelf, a laſſitude and heat in every limb; but my affection makes me ſtranger than I ſhould be otherwiſe. Their love and tenderneſs ſuſtain my courage. I perceive that, in the height of all their ſufferings, they refrain, as much as they are able, from complaint, for fear of giving me uneaſineſs. In the delirium of their fever, they do nothing but pronounce your name and mine, with tones of voice ſo moving, that one cannot poſſibly expreſs them; and no earlier than this very morning, Caroline deſired to ſee you. I replied that I could not ſend to London for you, leſt you ſhould catch her illneſs. "Oh, no, no, mama, ſaid ſhe, do not be afraid; I'll keep it all myſelf!" —"My child, replied I upon this, you might communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the infection to him, without loſing it yourſelf."— "So much the worſe," ſaid Caroline, and ſwooned away with weakneſs; but ſoon after, coming to herſelf, ſhe called me, ſaying, "Dear mama, you have the picture of papa about your neck; pray let me kiſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Harriet is afraid leſt my letter ſhould afflict you, and requeſts, with tears, that I would permit her writing ſomething to conſole you. I am fearful ſuch an effort may exhauſt her, but more fearful to afflict her by my refuſal; I am, therefore, giving her my letter, and her trembling hand writes this:

                  <p>YOU would never gueſs what has lately happened to my brother, to that upright and reſpected Daniel, whoſe good heart and prudent conduct made all his friends that were ſo happy as to be of his acquaintance! You remember, I ſuppoſe, the purſe that mama preſented him when you were by, with three new guineas in it. Well, thoſe three new guineas with the purſe are gone, and to increaſe your wonder, the poor boy will not or cannot tell which way. As it is ſuppoſed that he makes a ſecret of it from a principle of obſtinacy, he was ſhut up in a little room this morning, where he is not to be viſrted by any one, and whence he muſt not hope to be delivered but by making known the whole affair. How ſincerely I lament him, ſuffering this ſeverity of puniſhment! He has never been hitherto conſidered of an obſtinate or headſtrong diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. On the contrary, he has been always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his docility and frankneſs. I would willingly have pleaded in his favour, but could not obtain a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nevertheleſs, I am very ſure, he has not to reproach himſelf with any crime or meanneſs. Come this afternoon and ſee me, if you have your liberty. You may, in that caſe, comfort me in my dejected ſituation. The misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of my brother hurts me no leſs than it would do, had it happened to myſelf. Adieu! I am, in expectation of your viſit or reply,</p>

                  <p>I CANNOT but confeſs that I entertain ſome pity for your <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>reſpected</hi> Daniel; but ſo little, that he need not greatly tax his grateful nature to repay me. I could never pardon him for always finding ſomething or another to advance againſt me. Not that he has ever gone ſo far as publicly to tell his notions of me. If he had, I ſhould have known very well how to anſwer him: but it is an eaſy matter, by his looks, to be convinced he thinks me trifling, vain, capricious, and I know not what beſide. Whenever I have been cenſuring other people's imperſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their abſence, for the inſtruction of my friends, to hear his manner of defending them, one would imagine I were only venting ſlander. Well, at preſent then, my little judge himſelf is under condemnation; and indeed he muſt be highly guilty, ſince his very parents have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten all the ſilly fondneſs that they had for him. I am charmed that they have come to know him at laſt; and would lay a wager that he deſerves much greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he receives. Obſtinacy is a very frightful vice alone; but in addition, he is an awkward ſpendthrift. All the money that he can fiſh out of his father, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſes fooliſhly among a tribe of ragamuſſins, and has never had the ſpirit to employ it in a manner honourable to himſelf. If he had ſpent thoſe guineas in ſilk ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, faſhionable buckles, or the like, one might excuſe him. Did I ſay excuſe him? one might certainly applaud his judgment in that caſe. However, as I ſaid before, I pity him a little, being, as he is, your brother; but Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothea, you I pity moſt ſincerely, being, as you are, his ſiſter. I cannot poſſibly wait upon you this evening, it is ſuch charming weather for a walk: and then I have the prettieſt dreſs that ever you ſaw juſt come home, which I muſt certainly put on.

However, I muſt tell you, his affairs take now a very gloomy turn, at leaſt to all appearances. One of our ſervants has made a diſcovery of the purſe at a confec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner's hard by. It ſeems he went into the ſhop for change, and what ſhould the confectioner take out among his gold and ſilver, but the very purſe, which the ſervant inſtantly recollected? Yet he did not ſpeak a word about it there, but came directly home and told my father who is dreſſing now, that he may go to the confectioner's, and make enquiry how he got the purſe. It is no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that my brother ſhould have laid out three guineas on ſweetmeats, when he deprives himſelf of every thing by indulging his extreme generoſity. Papa himſelf is of the ſame opinion: but by what means could the purſe be where it is? He has not loſt it, ſince he knows (as he informed us) where it was; which certainly he meant to ſay by this expreſſion, <hi>it is at preſent in good hands.</hi> Why, therefore, ſhould he make a ſecret of it? Truly, I cannot tell what to think upon the ſubject: be it notwithſtanding

                  <p>I AM no leſs at my eaſe than you, upon account of Daniel, and as much perſuaded that this affair will turn out to his advantage. He has learnt, I make no doubt, already in his ſolitude, that he himſelf is far from being quite exempt from ſuch defects as he has frequently aſcribed to me; and the ſevere correction which he will certainly receive, will be revenge enough for me. On theſe conſiderations, I am entirely at my eaſe on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe by this means the affair will end to his advantage. It is indeed quite neceſſary to his growing perfection, that on this occaſion he ſhould undergo the ſevereſt puniſhment. How, my ſanctimonious Mr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel! you would perſuade your parents that you give every thing away in charity, and fiſh thus cunningly for money, which you afterwards lay out, three guineas at a time, in ſweetmeats! Truly, I do not wonder that he ſhould be ſo backward in revealing the affair. It would be very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to him. Obſtinate! a cheat! and a glutton! three good qualities indeed, and all at once diſcoverable in him! Mighty ſine! He calls the hands of a confectioner, good hands, becauſe, as I ſuppoſe, they make good things. There is charming logic for you! But adieu, my dear Dorothea! I ſincerely mourn your blindneſs to this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for-nothing brother's faults, and burn with abſolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, till you have told me how your hero will get clear of this adventure. After all my criticizing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I am ſo deeply intereſted in his welfare, as to beg that you would ſend me the firſt news poſſible concerning him.

                  <p>I TAKE the earlieſt opportunity in my power to ſatisſy your generous curioſity. My hero's grand adventure now is terminated in a way that gives ſatisfaction to every body —every body indeed, except the wicked. And this laſt circumſtance magnifies the pleaſure that I enjoy from this communication.</p>
                  <p>Here now follow the particulars of the affair at length. —My brother late laſt night was franding at the door, and ſaw a poor old man go by him, followed by three children that were crying bitterly. He ſupped them, and enquired the readen of their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſs. The old man was ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> aſhamed, he could not anſwer; but the eldeſt of the children told him, notwithſtanding frequent interruptions cauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bing, that they had not had a bit of any thing that day. "Alas! my little maſter," added he, "we are greatly to be pitied. We had formerly, as you have, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e houſe: but now are left without a ſhed to cover us. Our parents are both dead of broken hearts, and we have no friend to help us but our grandfather, and he is far too old and weak to work for our ſupport." The poor old man, while this was ſaying, hid his face and ſighed moſt lamentably. Daniel, who it ſeems was very much affected at the ſcene before him, had not time to take advice, but ran up ſtairs immediately to fetch his purſe, and gave it to the poor old man. He wept afreſh with joy and admiration at my little brother's generoſity, but would not take the money. Daniel fell into a paſſion ſeeing this, and nothing but the old man's acquieſcence in the gift could calm him. He did accept the purſe; but, as he judged the charity that he had received to be too conſiderable for a child like my brother to beſtow, he reſolved to bring it back next day. He went with ſuch a view to leave it at the ſhop of the confectioner, and aſked to have a ſhilling only to provide his little family a ſupper. I cannot tell you how he made the money up again, but not a quarter of an hour ago, and juſt before my father
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0360400704:227"/>could ſet out to ſpeak with the confectioner, he brought the purſe with all the money in it to our houſe. I could have wiſhed, miſs, that you had been preſent at this ſcene; you would then have been taught to entertain a different notion of my brother's generous heart. His noble ſacrifice, together with the old man's honeſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, made us all ſhed tears. The children and himſelf have had as much as twice the value of the purſe, and Daniel too has been paid for what he did, with ſiſty prayers and bleſſings. The concealment of this bounteous action, which my brother thought was nothing but his duty, puts a greater value on it in the eyes of my papa, and merits at my hand a meaſure of additional affection.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have diſmal news to tell you! Our good old friend Lawrence is no more. You recollect, he had been out of order ever ſince laſt autumn. For a fortnight paſt he had not left his room. Laſt Monday evening, when I came from ſchool, they told me that he had died that afternoon. I could not, I aſſure you, refrain from crying bitterly. His long indiſpoſition had before-hand rendered him much dearer to me. I employed the time that I had to ſpare from ſchool, in doing him whatever ſervice I was able. After all, alas! I owed him more than I had time and means to pay. He was our friend, and, I may add too, benefactor from the cradle. In our earlieſt childhood,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0360400704:228"/>we lived more a great deal in his arms, than on our feet. He was never out of temper, but always kind and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. How delighted was he, when he had it in his power to afford us any new pleaſure, or to diſguiſe an old one ſo that we might think it new! I verily believe, that all his pain in dying was, that death prevented him from being any longer uſeful to us. He had been of older ſtanding in the family than our papa; and though he was no better than a common ſervant, every body looked upon him with a ſort of veneration. During his laſt illneſs, no one paid a viſit here without enquiring; "and how fares the good old Lawrence?" I could ſee that the queſtion was agreeable to my papa, who always looked on Lawrence as a very faithful friend. If ſo, no wonder then that he ſupported him in his old age, and gave him every ſort of comfort that he could require. A gentleman could not have been more comfortably ſituated, or more attentively treated. Laſt night, when he was buried, I deſired papa's permiſſion to be preſent at the ceremony. He could not, without ſome difficulty, grant me ſuch a favoar, leſt it might have a bad effect upon me: but he ſaw that I ſhould have ſuffered more from being abſent. I accompanied the body therefore, holding up a corner of the pall. I thought that by this office we were ſtill attached to one another, and that really in ſome ſort I poſſeſſed him ſtill. When I was forced to quit my hold, my hand was juſt as if it had been numbed, and did not open without difficulty; but if this was mournful, it was much more melancholy when they let him down into the grave, and eſpecially when they filled it up. I could not take my eyes off from the ſpot. Till then I could not be perſuaded that Death had wholly ſeparated us. As long as I could ſee his coffin, there remained ſtill ſomething of him; but when this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder diſappeared, then I felt that I had for ever loſt him. All night long I ſaw him in my dreams: his ghoſt by no means frightened me: it ſeemed to ſmile upon me, and I ruſhed into its arms. I paſſed this morning in my chamber all alone, and was employed in writing you this letter. I deſigned to ſend you but a line or two, whereas my ſubject has extended while I ſpoke of Lawrence.—Our good friend is come to ſee me; Mr. Hutton, that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable worthy man, who takes ſo much delight in giving people pleaſure when he cannot do them good; and he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0360400704:229"/>has left me an exceedingly pathetic ſtory of a ſervant wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who worked hard to ſupport her miſtreſs after ſhe was fallen into poverty. Indeed I found it ſo exceedingly pathetic, that I ſet immediately about tranſcribing it, and ſend you a fair copy, ſince the reading of it may be a ſolace to you, as it was to me. At every act of friendſhip that Elſpy performed, I cried out, This Lawrence would have done for us, had we been in the ſituation of the lady. Ah, poor Lawrence! Ah, my good friend Lawrence!— Fare you well, dear ſiſter! I muſt here conclude my letter being ſent for down by my papa to entertain him, gloomy as I am myſelf. Aſſure my aunt and uncle of my beſt reſpects, and let each have two ſweet kiſſes, which they will place to my account. We have had a loſs in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which we cannot poſſibly make up but by loving one another more ſincerely.

               <p>MRS. Macdowell, a widow lady, of an ancient and reſpectable family in Scotland, after having enjoyed the advantages of fortune till the age of fifty years, ſaw herſelf all at once ſuddenly deprived of them, and reduced to the moſt helpleſs indigence. She never had been bleſſed with any children, who might now ſupport her by the labour of their induſtry; and every other individual of the family was equally involved in her misfortunes. Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the Highlands, ſhe was all day long ſoliciting a ſhelter for the night, and a morſel of bread for her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
               <p>Elſpy Campbell, who had been her faithful ſervant many years, and was always treated very kindly by her ancient miſtreſs, learns theſe diſmal tidings in her humble cottage, whither ſhe was now retired to paſs the remnant
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0360400704:230"/>of her days, far diſtant from her former ſervice. She immediately ſets out in ſearch of her reſpectable miſtreſs. There was a line marked our by her misfortunes, and the grateful Elſpy had but to walk in it. After much labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious travel, ſhe at laſt found the mournful object of her journey, and falling down on the ground before her, began thus: "Oh, my dear good miſtreſs! though I am hardly younger than yourſelf, I am, notwithſtanding that, much ſtronger and more capable of working. You, on the contrary, are far too feeble to go through with any thing like labour, on account of your former way of life, your troubles, and the ſeveral infirmities that are come all at once upon you. Come and take up your abode with me. I have a little cottage: it is well ſituated, and keeps out the weather. In addition to my cottage, I have a garden alſo, which produces me more potatoes than both of us can conſume. When I have tried all methods to ſupport you if I can, or rather when God's providence has once whatever he thinks proper to ſupport us both, you ſhall be free to quit me, if you find an inn with better entertainment: or ſtay with me, if you ſhould not find one.

I will live and die with one of ſo much gratitude; for I am ſure, God's bleſſing will be always with you."—They ſet out immediated, for Elſpy's dwelling. The cottage was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed extremely little, but poſſeſſed a healthful ſituation: cleanlineſs and order were the only decorations that it could boaſt. There was a hole on one ſide in the wall, through which a little light proceeded, when the wind was not that way: but when it would have incommoded her, the hole was ſtopped completely by a ſod with roſe leaves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eat into it, and poor blſpy was obliged to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the little light that reached her down the chimney. Elpy's bed, which was inviſible when people entered, was defended from the cold that would have reached it through the door-way, by a bank of earth. It
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0360400704:231"/>had a mattreſs ſtuft with ſtraw, good ſheets, a pair of blankets, and coarſe woollen rug. It had not curtains; but when Elſpy found that ſhe was in future to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the friendſhip and ſociety of ſo reſpectable a gueſt, ſhe bethought herſelf to hang the walls about it with a bulruſh lining, which was warmer than the ſilkieſt damaſk. In this bed ſlept Mrs. Macdowell, with her feet both placed againſt poor Elſpy's boſom, who was uſed to bend herſelf almoſt double, round the widow's legs, that ſhe might keep them warm. She never would conſent to lie beſide her miſtreſs; but the more ſhe ſaw her fallen from her former ſplendour, ſtill the more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and reſpect ſhe ſhowed her, to wipe out by that means all idea of the change ſhe had experienced in her fortune. An old Bible, Robinſon Cruſoe, and a few odd volumes of devotion and morality, which once had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, furniſhed ample matter for their evening's converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. With reſpect to their repaſts, they frequently had eggs, at all times milk, and were never without potatoes. The beſt baked potatoes, fieſheſt eggs, and largeſt bowl of milk, were conſtantly placed before Mrs. Macdowell.</p>
               <p>It will doubtleſs be a matter of ſome curioſity to know how Elſpy could keep up the honours of her cot in ſuch a ſtate of oeconomical abundance. To do this, ſhe had her ſpinning-wheel in winter, and her labours of the field <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n harveſt. It muſt notwithſtanding be acknowledged that ſhe poſſeſſed a manifeſt advantage over every younger woman, not ſo much for any natural activity, as for an obtuſe angle in her line of bodily direction, ſo that both her hands and eyes were nearer by a great deal to the ground than otherwiſe they would have been, and readier for her ſpinning-wheel. Beſides, when things were raiſed in price above her means to purchaſe them, ſhe had but to go out and beg aſſiſtance in the neighbouring towns and villages. For this ſhe had contrived a tolerable efficacious method. She would go among the richeſt farmers only, and when got before their door, ſtand ſtill, and lifting up her hands to heaven, cry out, "I come to aſk your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by no means for myſelf, for I can live on any thing, but for my miſtreſs, a lady of noble blood, daughter of Lord James, and grandchild of Lord Archibald."—If the farmers gave her any thing, or what ſufficed her reaſonable expectations, ſhe would add, "May the Almighty's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0360400704:232"/>with my miſtreſs's, and Elſpy Campbell's, come upon this houſe and its inhabitants!"—It is eaſy to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what ſucceſs this bleſſing, and the expectation of a different ſalutation from the lips of Elſpy, had ſhe been refuſed, produced from people naturally hoſpitable, and exceedingly attached to their nobility. She obtained by this method, victuals, cloaths, and very often money which ſhe carefully put up to buy her miſtreſs ſhoes and ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and theſe, when half worn out, ſerved afterwards for herſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus they lived, both happy; one in her exertions, and the other in her gratitude. The generous Elſpy was extremely rigorous on the ſubject of her duty. Mrs. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowell was a gentlewoman, and though ſupported by Elſpy, was not to forego the privileges of nobility; that is to ſay, ſhe was not to do any thing like work, no not ſo much as waſh her feet herſelf. One day, as Elſpy was employed in carrying out a baſket full of dung to lay on her potatoe beds, her miſtreſs had come out to get a pitcher full of water, and was now returning with it to the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Elſpy ſaw her, put the baſket down, and running to her, took away the pitcher, emptied it, and fetched her other water. When ſhe brought it in, ſhe ſaid with much reſpect, "Pardon me, madam! but you that are daughter of Lord James, and grandchild to Lord Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald, never ſhall demean yourſelf by carrying water while I live, and have my limbs to do it for you."</p>
               <p>The report of ſo much generoſity in one ſo indigent, at laſt reached me who am the writer of this ſtory, and I ſent her, every quarter, ſuch aſſiſtance as my fortune would allow. As long as Elſpy lived, which was upwards of ſix years from the time of my firſt learning theſe particulars, whenever I ſat down to dine or ſup in company, and was required to give my toaſt, it was always Elſpy Campbell. My attachment to this name generally made the company eager to know ſomething of the lady who engroſſed ſo great a ſhare of my affection. They would conſequently aſk me, begging pardon for their freedom; when I told them, Elſpy Campbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was an ancient beggar woman.— "What!" they would cry out, "a beggar!"—"Yes, but hear the reſt;" and then would follow the whole ſtory, ſuch in ſubſtance as I have already told it. Hardly ever could I finiſh, but half-crowns and half-guineas rained
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0360400704:233"/>into my hat for Elſpy. Theſe ſmall ſums, which I was ſure to ſend her pretty often, once occaſioned her to aſk my ſervant, "Who is it that ſends you? Doubtleſs, he is a friend of God. He does me good as God does, though I never ſee him."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Macdowell died, and Elſpy very quickly after, through affliction for the loſs of her good miſtreſs. She remembered nothing but the bounty of her former bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factreſs; what her gratitude had done in conſequence of that remembrance ſhe forgot.</p>
               <p>The generous, the heroic ſervility of Elſpy was not, as it might have been, a ſpark of gratitude that crackled for a moment and went out: it was an ardent flame that blazed for twenty years, till death ſuppreſſed it for a ſeaſon in the grave where ſhe was laid to reſt; for it is not utterly put out, ſince from her aſhes it will certainly burſt forth again, with renovated brightneſs, on the morning of that day that never is to finiſh.</p>

                  <p>WHAT ſorrowful tidings your letter brings me! Am I never more to ſee my dear friend Lawrence? Poor good man! he ſeemed to apprehend as much him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the day that I left you to come here. "It is very likely, dear Miſs Kitty," ſaid he, "you will never ſee me more, and therefore think of me at leaſt." Alas! I have been thinking of him, and concluded how it would pleaſe him when he found that I had, on my return. I thought to knit him a ſtout pair of ſtockings for next winter's wear, and was at work upon them at the very moment that I received your letter, with intelligence that he was dead. The work fell from me. After I had picked it up, I ſhed a ſtood of tears. "They are not then for him," I cried. "Oh! yes, they ſhall be; for I will finiſh both, and put them in my drawers, that they may daily be a token of remembrance for him."—You do not tell
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0360400704:234"/>me in your letter if he often ſpoke about me. I am ſure he did, but that you feared to aggravate my grief by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. I am greatly grieved that I was not preſent to attend upon him in his ſickneſs, as I verily believe that the pleaſure of our ſervices would have prolonged his days. I think, you acted very properly in going to his burial. I acknowledge, had I been at home, I ſhould not have poſſeſſed a heart to do ſo; but am therefore more affected at your ſtrength of mind and friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>In the ſorrow cauſed me by your letter, it was impoſſible for me to read the hiſtory of Elſpy Campbell without ſhedding tears. I thank you for it, and am thoroughly convinced, as you are, that our friend Lawrence would have done the ſame for us, had we been in the place of Mrs. Macdowell. I imagine it is the fault of maſters, if the major part of ſervants are not Lawrences and Elſpies. They addreſs them frequently ſo roughly, how can they ſuppoſe their ſervants ſhould do any thing but fear them? Since by accidental circumſtances they are placed in an inferior rank, is it humanity to tread them under foot? or rather, is it not our duty to afford ſuch tokens of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as may raiſe them in their own eſteem, and gain us their attachment? People ſeek to make themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by their countrymen and neighbours: why not then do more, and ſeek to be reſpected in their families, by thoſe who are preſent with them every moment of the day? Why not look upon them as a ſecond claſs of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Are there even many maſters who would do, to benefit the deareſt friend they are poſſeſſed of, what the generous Elſpy did in favour of her miſtreſs?—When my uncle had peruſed your letter, he informed me that a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of gentlemen in France had very lately recompenſed a conduct juſt like Elſpy's. I am glad to hear that it meets with imitation. It muſt certainly ſhew maſters the neceſſity of being kind and courteous to their ſervants, ſince it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I think, if ever we keep houſe, we ſhall be able, like papa, to fill it with ſuch people as will ſerve us with their hearts no leſs than with their hands.</p>

                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0360400704:235"/>This week has been a very ſad one for your poor ſiſter. Yeſterday my uncle took me out a walking with him in the country, to divert my ſorrow. Suddenly we heard a drum ſtrike up: we haſtened to the ſpot. It was for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral new recruits that had been levied and were going then to join their regiments. There were mixed among the ſoldiers many country-women who no doubt had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if not huſbands too, amongſt the party; for they did nothing but embrace and kiſs each other, and ſhed tears. When we had looked a little at this multitude, a woman dreſſed in mourning, of a very decent and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearance, drew our obſervation. She was taking leave of a young man who bit his lips to keep from crying. She gave him a bottle, which my uncle ſaid was brandy, and a little piece of canvas that had ſomething wrapped up in it. He accepted one, but would not take the other, though ſhe preſſed him very earneſtly. My uncle upon this drew near, and ſaid, Is that your ſon there, my good woman? Yes, ſays ſhe, my only ſon, ſir, and the would has not a better. My poor huſband died ten months ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and left me with three little girls beſides, the eldeſt not quite five years old. Our laſt bad harveſt made him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> five pounds in debt. When he was dead, the creditors came on me, and I thought would take away my little field which is all that we have for our ſupport. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting party then were with us, and a wealthy farmer's ſon had ſome how or another been drawn in to enliſt. He made it known about the country, that if any one would take his place, he ſhould receive four pounds. My ſon applied, and ſaid, that for five guineas he would be his man, which was at laſt agreed to. Of this I did not know a word until every thing was ſettled; otherwiſe I ſhould have begged my ſon to leave his ſiſters and myſelf to want a little for the preſent, rather than deprive me of his help, he being every thing imaginable to us, and the only friend that we have. I thought I ſhould have ſwooned when he preſented me the guineas which he had juſt received for enliſting. I applied to the recruiting ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant to break off the bargain, but he would not lend an ear to any thing that I ſaid. My ſon endeavoured to conſole me every way in his power, by ſaying that my little field was now ſet free, and therefore would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the children and myſelf from real want. Be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0360400704:236"/>ſaid he; I ſhall be quartered in the neighbourhood a little longer, ſo that every evening, when our exerciſe is over, I can come and work a little for you; and at worſt my time of ſervice is not longer than three years, and I ſhall then have my diſcharge.—Alas! cried ſhe, when every thing was going on ſo well, I did not doubt of being able ſoon to pay my debts; and he muſt leave me now! Perhaps the war will come again, and I ſhall never ſee him more.</p>
                  <p>My uncle aſked her what it was that ſhe would have given him in the piece of canvas. She replied, it was a guinea which had been paid her, not a week before, by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ady for the weaning of her child. It was all the money, added ſhe, that I have on earth, and I deſigned to keep it for ſome great emergency. I only wiſh that he would have taken it, but ſhould have known him better. He would never rob me, as he ſaid, no, not accept of any thing, when he had all day long been labouring for me; on the contrary, he uſed to give me what he earned among the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> for his work. My uncle took down her direction, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to do whatever he was able for her. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared extremely ſenſible of ſuch a kindneſs, and her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> lity affected me as much, for twenty times I was in tears while ſhe ſtood uttering her complaint; and yet I think, that I pitied the poor young man ſtill much more. It was very eaſy to diſcern the violence that he did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to hide his ſorrow from his mother and companions, notwithſtanding there was nothing in that ſorrow that he had any need to bluſh at. His poor mother wiſhed to go a little further with him; but, as ſoon as ever the drum ſtruck up, ſhe fell into a ſwoon. We brought her home, and tried all methods to conſole her: I, by gentle language, and my uncle by promiſes of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Hear me, my good brother, while I tell you an idea that has juſt now ſtruck me. From the loſs of Lawrence, we can tell how wretched they muſt be who are divided from the object of their love. The mother ſuffers ſurely more than we, as having loſt much more than we who do but mourn a friend. We cannot bring poor Lawrence back to life, but may reſtore at leaſt a ſon to his afflicted mother. I have done ſome needle-work to pleaſe my uncle, which he means to recompenſe by giving me an
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0360400704:237"/>elegant new gown. I will have the gown in ready money. And do you, on your ſide, uſe the greateſt expedition to complete the drawing that my papa has ordered. I am ſure, he will pay you very generouſly for it. We will then unite our little ſtock, and purchaſe the young ſoldier his diſcharge, thus ſhewing our regard to the memory of old Lawrence: ſo that, if mankind are to be recompenſed in future for the good that they do in this life, this kind action will be put to his account, who was the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and he will know that we love him ſtill as much as ever. I ſhall ſet out this day ſe'nnight to come home, when we will ſettle the affair together, and deſire papa to execute it. He will certainly be glad to ſerve us, and this hope is much the ſweeteſt that I can taſte, till I have once again the joy of ſeeng you. Farewel! I am rejoiced that I can on my part contribute the renewed friendſhip of which you ſpeak, and which will laſt as long as I have breath.</p>

                  <p>TRULY one muſt have queer notions to ſuppoſe that a ſiſter ſhould be proud of hearing from her brother! I imagine, all the boaſting ſhould be rather upon your ſide in reflecting, that for once at leaſt you have performed your duty, and not had your ears well pulled before-hand; though you loſe all merit in the matter, by inſinuating that you have written to me by papa's command, and for the ſake of little Noiſy. But indeed, you needed not have recommended Fidele ſo ſtrongly to my care, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed ſuch a deal of rhetoric in his behalf. He is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all my attention on his own account; ſo pray do not be uneaſy leſt I ſhould not uſe him kindly. It is true, I ſhall not fill his trough till it runs over, after the example of ſome little boys that I know, who would not care a farthing ſhould he burſt, as certainly he would, were he as fond as they are of his belly. Very likely too they would make one think that they overload him thus with victuals purely through kindneſs, when they only do it, that they may not have ſo troubleſome a taſk again upon their hands for ten or fifteen days to come. No, no; I will ſhow myſelf much more regular in my attention to him, as he certainly ſhall have freſh victuals every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Yeſterday when I approached his cage to clean it, the firſt thing that I ſaw was ſeed ſufficient to ſubtiſt him for a month, without including what was ſcattered on the bottom. To be ſure, I muſt confeſs he is ſuch a ſpend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hrift,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0360400704:240"/>that he ſcatters more about him in an hour, than would ſuffice him for a day. But how ſhall I deſcribe the floor of his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Thanks to your attention or your ſlothful waſte, it was exactly like a pond, occaſioned by continual overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from the fountain, and poor Fidele could not deſcend for fear of being drowned. How rejoiced he was to ſee the dry land! At firſt, he could not think of coming down, without precaution, as he tried it with one foot, while with the other he clung cloſely to the wire-work. Thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt expence have I enlarged his habitation; for he always kept upon the perches, fearing to dirt his feet and tail at leaſt, if not, as I have ſaid juſt now, to be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have ſtrewed a layer of fine ſand upon the bottom of his manſion, and adorned the ſides and top with groundſel, ſo that now he may ſuppoſe himſelf within a ſhady grove. In future, brother, you may do as you think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but it is I that take upon me to provide for Fidele. I will have his palace ſerve you as a model of propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and taſte in <hi>your</hi> apartment. I have written now enough I think to quiet the uneaſineſs that you intimated in your letter; and muſt tell you that I have alſo my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes, which I proceed to mention. You are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a little giddy-headed, and we have here a ſly black cat that comes a prowling daily. Take you care when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. I have obſerved that he has conceived a love for Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dele, ſufficient to alarm one. Yeſterday betimes, when I came in to give him food, I forgot to ſhut the door, and puſs had crept in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly after me. When I had waited on the bird, and given him what he wanted, I begun to thumb your books, when ſuddenly I heard a tender <hi>mewing</hi> behind me: I turned inſtantly about, and ſaw Grimalkin wriggling his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy every way upon a ſofa, oppoſite the cage. He was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring Fidele, he played his tail about, and ſeemed to ſay, "My dear, ſweet pretty bird, come now and perch cloſe by me; or elſe ſtay, I will jump upon your cage, for only ſee what nice ſoft paws I have to hug you! (but remark, he carefully concealed his claws.) I will fondle you all day, and preſs you to my tender heart. Do not let my whiſkers frighten you: they are long enough, I muſt acknowledge, but wont hurt you. I have a little mouth beneath them, Fidele, with which I will kiſs your pretty beak." Now what I do you imagine Fidele replied to theſe fine words?— Why nothing; but with eaſe one might diſcern that he
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0360400704:241"/>was not likely to become Grimalkin's dupe; and I ſuppoſe in puſſey's place he would have been as great a rogue. Have you been his inſtructor, brother, after all?—He ſtooped and raiſed his head, he ſhook his feathers, and caſt many a look of diffidence upon the orator, and of confidence on me, as if he would have ſaid, "I know you very well. Your ſugared words, your nice ſoft paws, and little mouth concealed beneath your whiſkers, are no leſs perfidious than your tender heart. You may deceive perhaps a poor mouſe: but me—Oh! no: I laugh at all your cunning, and defy your malice. I have here a friend to ſave me." Upon which he ſet a crying <hi>queek, queek, queek,</hi> with all his might. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him perfectly well; and without pretending that I heard any thing, I ran inſtantly to that part of the chamber, where there ſtood a ciſtern full of water, and beſprinkled our young gentleman ſo finely, as to put out all at once the fervour of his friendſhip. For he needed but one jump to be upon the floor, and as he ran away, he ſhook his coat as if he had the ague. Recollect this obſervation, ſhould he come incognito upon a viſit, after you have returned.</p>
                  <p>This mealy-mouthed, good-natured animal, whom many in the world reſemble, made me recollect an Ode our friend wrote, and which was lying in the paper-caſe. I ſend it you, that if you know of any good compoſer in your neighbourhood, you may prevail upon him for my ſake to ſet it, as they ſay, to muſic.</p>

                  <p>I have been hard at work theſe three days on the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of my travels, which I promiſed to ſend you, as a recompence for your care of Fidele. Papa approves the thought of our communicating our adventures thus to one another. His opinion, as I have already told you, is that by this ſort of correſpondence we ſhall acquire a habit of inditing with facility, and properly reflecting on ſuch objects as may ſtrike our ſight. As much as I have written, he informs me, ſeems to have been done with accuracy, and deſires to read the account that you have promiſed of your dinner in the country with mama. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric and Louiſa certainly were of the party: Oh, how much impertinence muſt of neceſſity have paſſed between you! but indeed, though you ſhould tell me only of your own, I know, you have a ſtock in hand ſufficient to ſupply a chapter, and that chapter not the ſhorteſt that was ever written. To encourage you in ſending me this chapter with the greateſt expedition, I ſhall be myſelf as quick as poſſible in the collation of the ſeveral parcels of my narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, inſcribed on more than twenty ſcraps of paper.

                  <p>WHAT can you be thinking of, to let me wait ſo long before I ſee the journal of your expedition? Are you gone, like Gulliver, to ſome unknown ſtrange iſland, for the ſake of having ſuch atchievements to record, as no one will be authorized to contradict? I cannot but admire the great exactitude and order on which you pride yourſelf ſo much, in the mention of your twenty ſcraps of paper,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0360400704:244"/>ſcattered up and down, no doubt in every corner of your chamber. It will be fortunate however, if the little cat belonging to your habitation does not pleaſe herſelf by playing with the beſt part of your narrative. I ſhould not be aſtoniſhed, were I to diſcover many chaſms in it, or perceive that you had begun with the concluſion, and affixed the fag-end, as we ſay, where the commencement ſhould be, which would prove at leaſt as entertaining as the chapter ſtuffed with my impertinences. I cannot tell at preſent, if the ciſtern-full of water would look well in my eſcutcheon: but ſuppoſe that your ſybill's leaves would make a ſpecial coat of arms for you.

                                 <p>ONE has no occaſion to go over ſo much ground as you have travelled, to be able to ſupply the reader with adventures. We had hardly paſſed the ſecond turnpike on the Clapham road, before we fell in with a drover, who was bringing up about a hundred ſheep to London. As our coachman thought his honour concerned in not permitting ſuch a ſcrabby drove of cattle to uſurp the road and make him quit his track, he drove the carriage through them. The poor ſheep, who are accounted to have honeſt hearts, but we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>k intellects, not knowing whither they ſhould run, in their confuſion got between the horſes legs; and ſome were even entangled in the ſpokes. The drover bid the coachman ſtop, as loud as he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0360400704:245"/>could roar; but the coachman, deaf to his vociferations, would not in the leaſt relax his ſpeed, and ſtill continued on the trot. The wind was rather freſh, and therefore we had all the glaſſes up. My brother Frederic wiſhed to know by what means the poor ſheep would free themſelves from their embarraſſment. Unfortunately, he forgot that if he wiſhed to look about him, it was neceſſary firſt of all to let the glaſs down, and of courſe he thruſt his head quite through and through the brittle cryſtal, which that moment broke into a thouſand pieces. You may judge with what alacrity he drew his head in once again; but in ſo doing, he was ſlightly wounded in his forehead by a piece of the broken glaſs. He put his hand directly on the part, and ſo contrived, as with the little blood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſcratch, to ſmear his face all over com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely, and looked exactly like the Jolly Bacchus, at the alehouſe oppoſite our door. Louiſa, at this ſight, was ſure that her brother muſt have had his noſe cut off, and did not doubt but it had dropped among the ſheep; on which the tender-hearted little thing began to cry, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric! ah my poor dear brother! till mama had, with a little ſcented water which ſhe poured upon her handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, wiped his face clean, and given it once more that ſly look which you know it poſſeſſes. Well, dear brother, what are your ideas? I, for my part, fancy that you do not engroſs all the giddineſs belonging to our family, and already little Frederic gives full proof that he is not a jot leſs giddy than his elder brother.</p>
                                 <p>Nothing worth mention happened after this event, till we arrived at Margaret's, our dear nurſe, with whom we were to dine and ſtay till evening. After having all of us received her kind embraces, we went through the houſe, and into the fields, where we propoſed to take a walk. By accident, I was a little diſtant from the reſt; and as I paſſed along a hedge, obſerved three little birds that had been taken by the leg in a perfidious ſpringe. The pretty creatures flapped their wings moſt lamentably, and implored me, or at leaſt I thought ſo, to ſet them free. You may ſuppoſe, I did not ſhow myſelf inſenſible to their petition. Inſtantly I broke their bonds, and had the pleaſure to behold how grateful they appeared; for I could fancy gratitude in all their motions, as they flew away. This pity that I had ſhown them did not pleaſe a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0360400704:246"/>little country boy who lived hard by, and had eſtabliſhed very greedy hopes upon the ſale of theſe three priſoners; ſo that their deliverance, as I mean to let you ſee, and ſhortly, but for accidental circumſtances, might have coſt us dear.</p>
                                 <p>The ſun towards noon had diſſipated all the miſts. The day was ſo delightful, that mama deſired we might enjoy the pleaſure of a rural meal, and therefore requeſted Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet to let us have our dinner in the garden. After din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we had ſtrawberries and cream; and at the very moment when poor Frederic with the freedom which country manners allow, happened to be lifting up the platter to his mouth, that he might ſave himſelf the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſpatching matters with the ſpoon, a ſtone (behold ye) ſtruck it right upon the rim, and overſet its whoſe contents upon the table, not without firſt plentifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkling ſeveral of us round about. You ſhould have ſeen us in the height of our confuſion, palpitating as we ſat with fright, as if we had imagined that Jupiter was flinging down his thunderbolts among us. Margaret's huſband, who is not a man to ſwoon away at every noiſe, that moment poſted towards the garden door, to catch this thundering deity, who was certainly the little peaſant that had ſet the ſpringes. But the deity, like thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Homer, who amuſed themſelves at the expence of mortals, had already made himſelf inviſible. It was all loſt labour that our hoſt ſtood ſentry at the door. He only ſaved us from the danger of another thunderbolt, which might have otherwiſe been pointed at us.</p>
                                 <p>Dinner was now over, and I thought of paying one more viſit to the neighbouring hedges, and delivering, if I could, ſome other priſoners, when mama informed us that we muſt think of ſetting out on our return. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the coach once more with ſome reluctance, after having made dear Margaret our little preſents each. There never ſure had been a finer evening. From a hill, upon the top of which our coachman ſtopped to give his horſes breath, we had the pleaſure to behold a ſpacious horizon aderned with clouds of every colour, and ſet off with gold. The ſun, that as I thought rejoiced in having acceſs to us given him by Frederic, coloured, out of gratitude, Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa's face and his with all the purple of his rays. Our couſin, who you know has been abroad, at ſuch a ſight
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0360400704:247"/>turned round, and told mama that they looked exactly like the cherubims that Roman Catholics are uſed to place for ornament about the altars in their churches.</p>
                                 <p>The poor ſheep that we met in the morning, certainly muſt have alarmed their comrades, and gone off, as we encountered none on our return. We met no ſort of company but half a dozen aſſes who had certainly a very reverend figure, and a mule or two. Our horſes, who, I fancy, thought they could diſcern a family reſemblance in theſe laſt, were giving up the right-hand ſide of the road, and complimenting them with fifty gambols and curvets; but our proud coachman would preſerve the honour of his ſeat, and feelingly convinced them with his whip, that they were creatures of much more importance; and that ranking as they did above them in all books of natural hiſtory, it was but juſt they ſhould preſerve it on the road. They were obliged to yield aſſent to arguments ſo ſtriking, and got home in perfect order, and without another miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure.</p>

And after having told you what has happened to me in the compaſs of a ſingle pariſh, you may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what ſurpriſing matters I ſhould have to tell you in a longer journey. I begin to think that at the period of Knight Errantry, I ſhould have made a pretty figure, and particularly if I myſelf ſung the great atchievements that I ſhould perform; which truſt me I would do, leſt any one, who might be tempted to record them, ſhould not do it to my l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <p>WE rolled along in ſilence for the ſpace of twenty minutes in our carriage, with no leſs velocity than the clouds above our heads. I bleſſed the memory of him who firſt of all invented this delightful way of travelling without pain or trouble; and ſhall always think it charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till ſome other perſon brings the project to perfection of tranſporting us ſtill more delightfully, by means of a ballcon, with eagles to direct it.</p>
                                 <p>I was meditating on this ſubject, when of a ſudden I perceived the coachman violently exerciſed at ſomething or another. His great coat had ſlipped from off his ſeat on one of the front wheels, which carried it about the center. After many revolutions, he had made ſhift to faſten on a ſleeve, which he was pulling to him, and eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating as he tugged, My coat! my coat! I thruſt my head out haſtily to ſee what ailed him, when my hat blew off; ſo I joined in concert with the coachman, and cried out as luſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>ly, My hat! my hat! Poor Jeffry, from his ſtation in the rear, ſtood witneſs to my lamentations, and leaned over towards me, when, behold ye! the furred cap that he wears, fell off. He did not imitate us, crying out, My cap! my cap! but aiming to recover it when falling, ſomehow or another loſt his footing, and came down the neareſt way head-foremoſt. Happily for Jeffry we were going through a very ſoft quagmire, otherwiſe I cannot pretend to tell you what misfortune would have befel his limbs; at leaſt, I am ſure, his noſe and chin would have been both demoliſhed, as he fell into the quagmire belly downwards. All this happened in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. My papa, in this confuſion, was the only perſon who retained his ſenſes. He let down the glaſs in front, and ſeizing on the coachman's reins, which now were fallen from him, ſtopped the horſes. Upon this, the coachman getting down, made ſhift to free his coat. But what long faces did he make, when he ſaw in the middle of the back a monſtrous rent, through which a judge might eaſily have thruſt his head, and not diſordered his huge wig. On his ſide, Jeffry, as I ſaw, had got his mouth ſo filled with mud, that he could not for a time bring out a ſingle ſyllable. O ſiſter! had you ſeen him
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0360400704:249"/>thus beplaiſtered as he was, affect a grin, in order to ſhow papa that his fall had broke no bones, I am ſure, you would have laughed for a month to come, at recollecting his appearance. He did nothing in the world but ſneeze, and ſputter, ſhake himſelf, and rub his knees and elbows with both hands: his coat, which had been green, no longer now preſerved that colour any where, except be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. In ſhort, he looked as if he was dreſt for a maſquerade.</p>
                                 <p>He went a little back to ſeek his fox-ſkin cap. By great good luck, the maker had not taken off the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's tail, but left it on to ſerve by way of plume. By that, it was diſcovered in the quagmire, and by that fiſhed up. When he had got it out, he was obliged to wring it twenty times, before it was in a ſtate for travelling, even under Jeffry's arm. He alſo picked up my hat, but not before the wind had made it cut a hundred capers this and that way in the air. It loſt however nothing by ſo many ſomerſets; on the contrary, it got a comfortable coat, which, though all the bruſhes of the houſe have frequently been exerciſed upon it, nevertheleſs it ſtill retains, and ſeems determined to retain, in ſpite of their beards.</p>
                                 <p>After we were once again prepared for motion forward, and affairs about us in their former order, we proceeded to philoſophize upon theſe accidents: but after having tried to do ſo in a very ſerious ſtrain, we fancied the beſt method was to take the affair more gaily. My papa drew conſolation from his purſe to give the coachman; and on my ſide, as I obſerved Jeffry in pain about his fur-cap only, ſince the livery was his maſter's property, I tipped him ſuch a wink as reſtored him to a better temper. After which, we all went forward, juſt as if no accident had happened.</p>
                                 <p>We were now come near a village, when papa diſcerned an ancient ſoldier ſeated on a ſtone beſide the road. One leg was under him, bent backward, and the other, a wooden one, ſtuck out ſtiff before him. A long crutch lay quietly upon his left, and on his right-hand ſat a great black dog. Papa, who loves a ſoldier, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when that ſoldier is a cripple, courteouſly ſaluted him, and bade me fling a ſhilling to him, which he gave me. I fulfilled ſo honourable a commiſſion in a very dexterous manner, I may ſay without the leaſt degree of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0360400704:250"/>oſtentation, as I did not miſs the hat. The ſoldier's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was uttered in ſo high a pitch, that it ſufficed to wake a ſorry beggar-woman, who lay ſleeping not far off upon a little ſtraw. She trotted after us, and reached the carriage juſt as we were ready to alight and put up at an inn. "Ah, ſir!" ſaid ſhe to my papa, "how you beſtow your charity! and if you give it to an old drunkeu fellow, what aſſiſtance will you afford an honeſt woman, as I am, who have not ſwallowed theſe ten years a glaſs of any liquor ſtronger than ſmall beer?"—Papa, whoſe mind was occupied on many ſubjects at that inſtant, was not thinking of the invalid, and viewed her with a viſible aſtoniſhment. "Yes, yes, ſir," continued ſhe, "it is of that drunken ſoldier I am ſpeaking. Oh! I heard how much he thanked you for the ſhilling which, it ſeems, you threw him by this little gentleman. I would lay a wager, that, before night comes, he will have ſpent it all in gin. And then, ſir, did not you remark the great black dog beſide him as he ſat? A beggar keep a dog! What is that but robbing other people who deſerve aſſiſtance?"—"Hold your tongue!" ſaid my papa, and ſeemed quite angry. "Why abuſe a man at this rate, who has no leſs need than you of my compaſſion? If he drinks a little gin, I can forgive an ancient ſoldier ſuch a fault. While we are ſeated at our eaſe before a good fire, and even you are not without ſo great a comfort, ſoldiers muſt endure the wind, ſnow, rain, and every rigour of cold winter. Where can be the wonder then, if they ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to what is ſure to warm them, and in time become accuſtomed to it? And reſpecting his great dog, perhaps that animal may be the only friend that he has, his tried aſſociate, and the ſingle creature who partakes of his bad days."—When he had ſaid theſe words, he held out two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, without looking at her. She received them with a kind of ſoorn, and went off grumbling all the way, as long as we could hear her ſpeak. The ill-natured wretch had made me angry. "I am very ſorry, ſir," ſaid I, "that you gave her any thing. She muſt be ſure a very horrid creature to abuſe a poor old ſoldier, and be envious of the alms that you gave him."—"You are in the right," replied my father. "He who wiſhes to excite my pity, to another's detriment, deſerves my indignation only. Yet I ſaw that ſhe was in want, and only upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0360400704:251"/>forgot her evil diſpoſition. It is puniſhment enough that ſhe is reduced to beg. Had ſhe but kept her tongue in bounds, I would have given her what the ſoldier had."</p>
                                 <p>While we were thus diſcourſing with each other, our hoſt had ſhown us up into a room, of which one window opened towards the road that we had been travelling, and another towards a yard behind the houſe. While they were getting dinner ready, I ſtood looking out, to mark the carriages that were continually going by; and what can you imagine, ſiſter, I beheld, when I had hardly been a minute there?—the beggar-woman, who was now come back, and had by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                    </gap>ime ſet herſelf upon a block beſide the gate-way. She p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>d out a little flaſket full of brandy from her pocket, and began to give a hearty pull. I called out to papa, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>nd bade him come and ſee. He told me not to ſpeak, leſt we ſhould be overheard. We both looked at her, and ſoon ſaw the ſoldier likewiſe coming down the road, ſupported by his crutch, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the great black dog. As ſoon as the old woman ſaw him haſting towards her, ſhe put up her flaſket with the greateſt haſte into her pocket. We were both of us the greateſt haſte into her pocket. We were both of us curious to overhear their converſation. "Mother," ſaid the ſoldier, who was now come pretty near her, "do you mean to take a lodging here, and have no dinner? You are not hungry, I ſuppoſe."—"Heaven help me!" ſaid the hypocrite, and made as if ſhe wept. "I aſſure you, my good friend, I do not want for an appetite: if I could but come at ſomething good to eat, I ſhould not much mind what it was."—"If that be all," replied the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſoldier, "I have ſufficient for us both." On this he ſat down by her, ſlipped a knapſack from his ſhoulder, and took out a lump of coarſe brown bread, together with a ſlice of cheeſe wrapt up in paper, which he held out to the woman, ſaying, "There, good woman, help your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf." She did, and pretty plentifully. He put up with what was left, though but a trifle; and of this, for every bit that he ate himſelf, the large black dog had likewiſe his ſhare, who had aſſumed his place behind, and all the while was reſting in a very friendly way his head upon his maſter's ſhoulder.</p>
                                 <p>During their repaſt, the hypocritical old woman turned her converſation on the unfeelingneſs of travellers; adding that the gentleman, who had but juſt before alighted from
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0360400704:252"/>his carriage and put up for dinner at the inn before them, gave her only a poor halfpenny. "That cannot be true," replied the honeſt-hearted ſoldier. "He muſt be a noble gentleman; or certainly he had no money in his purſe but gold, which could not eaſily be changed. See, what he threw me by the little gentleman his ſon—a ſhilling! It is not always that pieces of this weight of metal tumble into my hat. But do not you fret yourſelf, for you ſhall be the better for my luck. I cannot be happy by myſelf. A good repaſt requires good liquor, and I have not had a drop within my lips to-day, although it is very late. The truth is, my poor money bag was ſo conſumptive, that I could eaſily have paſſed it through a needle's eye this morning; but thank heaven, at preſent it is quite plump and jolly, ſo that I can well afford to lay out ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for us both. Come, good mother, let me have your hand."</p>
                                 <p>Saying thus, he roſe much in ſpirits, and quite jovial. The old woman took upon her the attendant's part, and officiouſly held him out his crutch, careſſing now and then the dog. I could have found it in my heart to beat the wretch for this diſſembled friendſhip. They walked up together to the houſe, and entered at the gate-way; while on our part, we above ſtairs ſhifted ground, and haſtened towards the other window which looked out into the yard. We heard the ſoldier call for a gill of brandy with two little glaſſes, one of which he filled and gave the woman, who made haſte and ſwallowed it immediately. Papa could not reſtrain his indignation any longer. "Out on ſuch a hateful creature!" cried he.—They both lifted up their heads. The woman recollecting us, that moment gave a ſhriek; but, on the contrary, the ſoldier was not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed. "See," ſaid he, "good ſir, how we are making merry through your bounty. Let me drink your health," continued he, and took his hat off, "with the gentleman your ſon's. I never forget any one, however little, that is but generouſly diſpoſed."—"Much good may the liquor do you, my worthy fellow," anſwered my papa. "I like your ſpirit. However poor you are, you can oblige; ſo here is a trifle more to ſtrengthen your remembrance of us," throwing him a half-crown piece. "But as for all thoſe wretches that can firſt abuſe an honeſt fellow, and then drink his liquor juſt as if it were their own"—
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0360400704:253"/>The wretch would hear no more, hung down her head, and in confuſion ſneaked away.</p>
                                 <p>While we were both at dinner, the landlord informed us that the honeſt ſoldier, whoſe name was Trim, had been a long while in the ſervice; that he had not quitted it before he loſt his leg, and had the friendſhip and eſteem of all his officers. "It is he," continued the hoſt, "who keeps up peace and order in the village, ſince his ſoldier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like appearance awes the vagabonds about us. Every body would be glad to give him victuals, if he would but take their bounty; but he never will accept of any thing that he has not earned by ſome good ſervice or another, as by going upon errands, which he does with no leſs expedition than fidelity. I ſhould have put him in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had I even refuſed to take his money for the gill of brandy. He aſſerts that I ought to live by what I get in trade, whoever are my cuſtomers; and ſays that, if I gave him any thing, I ſhould be then obliged to charge it elſewhere, which would be unjuſt. As regularly as the morning comes, he goes out loaded with a baſket full of flints upon his ſhoulder, and fills up the holes that have been made the day before along the road. You muſt have noticed in what admirable order it appeared. He never aſks for any thing; but there is ſcarce a traveller accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to the road who does not throw him ſomething as he paſſes by. He takes it without any heſitation, as he thinks that he has deſerved it. This is his employ all ſummer; and in winter, when the weather is at the coldeſt, he fills up his time in making children's wooden clog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>, for which he takes up his ſeat in my kitchen chimney. He generouſly gives theſe clogs to thoſe whoſe parents are ſo poor that they cannot pay his price, leſt they ſhould happen to catch cold. The only recompenſe that he aſks of them for this trouble, is to ſee them dance before him."</p>
                                 <p>Well, ſiſter, what are your thoughts of this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Trim? This laſt particular in his ſtory gave me ſo much pleaſure, that I ordered a pair immediately for you, which I ſhall take when I return. As you are far too generous, and beſides too di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>nt to diſcharge the value of the clogs in capers, I have engaged myſelf, as you would do, to pay him for them in hard money. I deſign to give him half-a-crown, and then the clogs will
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0360400704:254"/>be much worthier of you. They will not be uſeleſs, if you mean to run about at any time next winter in the garden.</p>
                                 <p>If I did not apprehend that my journal had already tired your patience, I ſhould have a great deal more to mention. I would tell you how, as we were going on, I terminated an important matter in a way which Don Quixote, celebrated as he was for bravery, would never have thought of. You will ſuppoſe, perhaps, that after ſuch a preface, there was an inchanter, or at leaſt a giant in the caſe, or ſome illuſtrious princeſs to deliver, or ſome great kingdom to be recovered by conqueſt. It was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this. It was no other than a little girl who was tending a cow, and a boy engaged in the ſame office with an aſs, who were ſtruggling with each other for an apple which the former had found. After having very gravely taken all the neceſſary information of their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, I took up, as you may gueſs, the weaker party, and defended her, but not in more than words, ſince fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for the ſtronger, I had neither lance nor ſhield; or rather, to confeſs a truth, becauſe, even though I had, he was of a ſize to thraſh my knighthood ſoundly. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived immediately that the moderation of a Solomon or a Titus ſuited much better with my inferiority of ſize, and therefore I adjuſted the affair in conteſt to the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both combatants, by ſharing equally between them the remainder of that tart which you know the cook had made me, that I might not faint with hunger by the way.</p>
                                 <p>I might go on, and tell you of the pitiable fortune of a hare that we ſaw running acroſs the country, followed by a pack of hounds and huntſmen. The poor creature, after having often thrown them out, as is the phraſe with ſportſmen, by her doublings on the open plain, had crimbed a pointed rock. A furious dog perceived her in this laſt retreat, and had the audacity to force her. I beheld them both roll down the precipice together, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably mangled.—But this picture is much too cruel: is it not Jeſſica?—Let me therefore touch on themes more p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If your dry jokes had not for ever undeceived me on the ſubject of my own excluſive merit, I ſhould think myſelf a cleverer fellow, from the hearty welcome that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. It is much more modeſt in me to ſuppoſe myſelf
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0360400704:255"/>indebted for that welcome to the recollection of your viſit here, which they have cheriſhed ever ſince laſt year. I do ſuppoſe it, and place all my boaſt in thanking you for having laid the ground-work of the entertainment that I am now experiencing.</p>
                                 <p>And thus, dear ſiſter, I have ſent you a recital of my wonderful adventures, which perhaps you will think too tedious. The moſt perilous of every circumſtance attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them was, when, to give you ſome amuſement, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to put them down in black and white. I thought that I never ſhould have come to the concluſion of my taſk. I will not boaſt of any merit in the execution of my great undertaking, and yet I pleaſe myſelf with thinking that you will owe my kindneſs ſomething, when you come to be acquainted that at preſent they have been ringing for me theſe ten minutes to come down and eat ſome fritters which are growing cold, while I myſelf am hard at work in winding up my letter. I can hardly fancy that the heroiſm of fraternal love ever yet went much farther than I have puſhed it in this ſingle inſtance for your ſake.</p>
                                 <p>Adieu, dear ſiſter! I will divert myſelf as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for your ſake rather than my own, that at the time of my return I may preſent myſelf before you ſo much the more merry-hearted. I cannot tell what you may think of this; but I, for my part, think that you ſhould look upon it as a proof of the tenderneſs of that attachment with which I am, dear ſiſter, yours,</p>
