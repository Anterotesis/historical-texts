            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
            <p>IF there is any Thing, in my Writings, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be remember'd, They will <hi>live,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Patronage: If They ought to be forgotten, They wou'd <hi>die,</hi> in ſpite of Protection. So I commit them to the World, unſuſtain'd by <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—</hi>No Patron's Authority can protect a <hi>bad</hi> Work.—And a <hi>good</hi> one can want no Protection.</p>
            <p>I am afraid, we need look no farther, than the <hi>Dedications</hi> of our Poetick Writings, for the Source of that <hi>Neglect,</hi> which the <hi>Art, Itſelf,</hi> complains of.—While Poetry preſerv'd its Honeſty, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd with Diſtinction; But, when it degenerated into a Traffick, between <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Reward,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came deſpis'd, like the Gold of <hi>Utopia,</hi> not by Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of its Value, but through ſcorn of the Uſe, It was put to.</p>
            <p>Before I ſpeak of the following Tragedy, I am oblig'd to take Notice of another, the firſt Dramatic Sally of my Youth: And which, I ſhou'd be aſham'd to confeſs, I had the Folly to begin and finiſh in a Week, but that I have Occaſion, from that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to hope Pardon of its Faults; and admire the <hi>Engliſh Good-nature,</hi> which receiv'd it, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerv'd Indulgence.—It was written on the ſame Subject with <hi>This,</hi> (upon Mr. <hi>Booth's</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it to my Choice.) It was, alſo, acted at the ſame Theatre; and is, ſtill, a Living Evidence, againſt me, under the Name of <hi>Elfrid;</hi> or, the <hi>Fair Inconſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I knew nothing of the Rules of Writing, the Play was, conſequently, an unprun'd Wilderneſs of Fancy, with here and there, a Flower, among the Leaves; but without any Fruit, of Judgment.—I know not how it came to paſs, that <hi>Athelwold,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0099700300:4"/>
even in That Piece, deſerv'd ſome little Pity: But, I am afraid, I was too Dull a Painter, to hit a Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Ladies.<hi>—Elfrid</hi> ſuffer'd more, by <hi>my</hi> ill Conduct, than Her own; and was a lighter <hi>Inconſtant,</hi> than the Hiſtories of thoſe Times have ſhown her: And, as for <hi>Edgar,</hi> The Monarch came out of <hi>my</hi> Hands, as one of his Succeſſors, out of the Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi>'s; ſtript of Every Thing that became his Condition, and only a King in his <hi>Title.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I therefore conſider'd myſelf as not deſerving Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, from the Publick, till I had purchas'd it, with ſomething, <hi>Better,</hi> on the ſame Subject.—This was the Original of <hi>Athelwold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The New Play has neither Thought, Deſign, nor Expreſſion, in the leaſt, reſembling the Old one; And my only Reaſon, for troubling the Reader with this little Story, is, becauſe, ſhou'd there be any Thing in the ſecond Attempt, greatly Preferable to the Firſt, it will be a <hi>Proof,</hi> that Fancy (for, to ſay <hi>Genius,</hi> wou'd be making bold, with what is none of my own,) wants the Aid of the Judgment; and ſhou'd have Regard to the <hi>Rules,</hi> of an Art, which, like Religion, had an Orthodox Eſtabliſhment; but (like that too) has been warp'd, and weaken'd, by myſterious Dullneſs, and the dry Pride of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators.</p>
            <p>I am unable to execute any Thing in Poetry, if I have <hi>waſted</hi> the Care, I beſtow'd on this Tragedy:—Nor can I have ſo unjuſt an Opinion of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Taſte, (tho I think Nobody will celebrate it, for Poetry,) as not to know, that ſhou'd there be Merit in <hi>Athelwold,</hi> there are Spirits, in the Nation, who have Influence, and Generoſity, to awaken others, into their Sentiments.—I ſay this, for the ſake of the <hi>Stage;</hi> for, as to myſelf, the Diſtinction of Deſerving to be <hi>Read,</hi> is all the Advantage I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe from my Writings.</p>
