            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WHAT odd fantaſtick Things we Women do!</l>
               <l>Who wou'd not liſten when young Lovers woo?</l>
               <l>But die a Maid, yet have the Choice of Two!</l>
               <l>Ladies are often cruel to their Coſt;</l>
               <l>To give you Pain, themſelves they puniſh moſt.</l>
               <l>Vows of Virginity ſhou'd well be weigh'd;</l>
               <l>Too oft they're cancell'd, tho' in Convents made.</l>
               <l>Wou'd you revenge ſuch raſh Reſolves—you may:</l>
               <l>Be ſpightful—and believe the thing we ſay,</l>
               <l>We hate you when you're eaſily ſaid Nay.</l>
               <l>How needleſs, if you knew us, were your Fears?</l>
               <l>Let Love have Eyes, and Beauty will have Ears.</l>
               <l>Our Hearts are form'd, as you your ſelves wou'd chuſe,</l>
               <l>Too proud to ask, too humble to refuſe:</l>
               <l>We give to Merit, and to Wealth we ſell;</l>
               <l>He ſighs with moſt Succeſs that ſettles well.</l>
               <l>The Woes of Wedlock with the Joys we mix;</l>
               <l>'Tis beſt repenting in a Coach and ſix.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Blame not our Conduct, ſince we but purſue</l>
               <l>Thoſe lively Leſſons we have learn'd from you:</l>
               <l>Your Breaſts no more the Fire of Beauty warms,</l>
               <l>But wicked Wealth uſurps the Power of Charms;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0057801000:70"/>
What Pains to get the Gaudy Thing you hate,</l>
               <l>To ſwell in Show, and be a Wretch in State!</l>
               <l>At Plays you ogle, at the Ring you bow;</l>
               <l>Even Churches are no Sanctuaries now.</l>
               <l>There, golden Idols all your Vows receive;</l>
               <l>She is no Goddeſs that has nought to give.</l>
               <l>Oh, may once more the happy Age appear,</l>
               <l>When Words were artleſs, and the Thoughts ſincere;</l>
               <l>When Gold and Grandeur were unenvy'd Things,</l>
               <l>And Courts leſs coveted than Groves and Springs.</l>
               <l>Love then ſhall only mourn when Truth complains,</l>
               <l>And Conſtancy feel Tranſport in its Chains.</l>
               <l>Sighs with Succeſs their own ſoft Anguiſh tell,</l>
               <l>And Eyes ſhall utter what the Lips conceal:</l>
               <l>Virtue again to its bright Station climb,</l>
               <l>And Beauty fear no Enemy but Time.</l>
               <l>The Fair ſhall liſten to Deſert alone,</l>
               <l>And every <hi>Lucia</hi> find a <hi>Cato</hi>'s Son.</l>
