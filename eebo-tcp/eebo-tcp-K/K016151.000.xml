            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are few Men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (except ſome of my own Country, miſled by a Zeal both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet and unwarrantable) who do not readily acknowledge <hi>POE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRY,</hi> to be the Daughter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and originally deſign'd, to tune Men's Minds to Devotion. This is evident from the many noble Poems, in the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> to ſay Nothing of other Writings. But the primitive Simplicity, becoming gradually loſt, as the Art was apply'd to Ends, unworthy its Inſtitution, the Reformers were obliged to take Advantage of Mens Paſſions, by giving it a new Turn, which, under the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Delight, diſguis'd the Doctrine they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. <hi>TRAGEDY,</hi> in particular, was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>Muſe's</hi> Power. Till <hi>that</hi> became known, there was wanting a kind of Poetry, which, imitating the Actions of Mankind, might work a readier, and more ſenſible Effect, by a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vection of the Paſſions. The Prevalence of Vice, 'tis true, and Men's natural Propenſity to reſiſt good Inſtruction, allow'd not a Succeſs to <hi>TRAGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DY,</hi> ſo univerſal, as it merited. But ſince no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Help, than <hi>this,</hi> can be devis'd, the Friends, of Vertue and Genius, muſt uſe the means it affords them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1269802300:7"/>
In Countries, where <hi>CHRISTIANITY</hi> is receiv'd and eſtabliſhed, ſome may, poſſibly, imagine, there is, now, no longer Need of the Aſſiſtance of <hi>TRAGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DY:</hi> But Experience convinces us, That many frequent the <hi>STAGE,</hi> who would hardly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon, to receive Counſel from the <hi>PULPIT.</hi> The <hi>CLERGY,</hi> therefore, ſhould conſider, as Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries and Fellow-Labourers, thoſe <hi>POETS,</hi> who preach Vertue, from the <hi>Preſs,</hi> or the <hi>Theatre.</hi> And ſince we ſeek not a Share of <hi>their</hi> Revenues, for the Pains we take, in their Service, they ought, at leaſt, in Civility, to allow us their Countenance and Acknowledgement! Is there a Kirkman, among my Adverſaries, whoſe Zeal is ſo militant, as to fight without Wages? Why, then, am I condemn'd, who, more generouſly, go to War, in a Way, they could not take themſelves, were they hindred from fighting againſt Vice from the Pulpit! Who is ſo rude, as to blame an honeſt <hi>Volunteer,</hi> in a good Cauſe? Or, if one deſerves, to be a <hi>Commander in Chief,</hi> Why is he grudged Preferment, beyond the Liſt and Rate, of an <hi>Half-Pay-Officer.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome, who are moderate, becauſe more wiſe, than <hi>thoſe</hi> I have had to do with, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the <hi>STAGE capable</hi> of being made <hi>uſeful,</hi> yet condemn it, on Account of the <hi>Abuſes</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges.—Would they deſtroy the <hi>Being</hi> of an Art, becauſe its Uſe is corrupted? They argue, like thoſe Zealous indeed, but <hi>weak</hi> Reformers, who were for demoliſhing Churches, that they might be ſure to leave no Images. According
<pb facs="tcp:1269802300:8"/>
to theſe Mens Way of Reaſoning, every Thing, that is not perfect, is dangerous and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for there is nothing ſo excellent, where Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may not enter. <hi>Preaching,</hi> thêy know well, is often <hi>abuſed,</hi> will they allow me, therefore, to cry out, That all <hi>Preaching</hi> is <hi>unlawful?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I writ the following ſhort <hi>TRAGEDY,</hi> to give my Countrymen, of the Kirk, an Example, that ſound and uſeful Inſtruction may be drawn from the <hi>Theatre,</hi> and that, only, the Abuſe is blameable. I might, indeed, have referred my over-rigid Adverſaries to other Pieces of <hi>Dramatic POETRY,</hi> already extant: But ſome Peculiarities, in my Caſe, (which the World is likely to know more of, very ſoon,) obliged me, to give a Specimen, my ſelf, of a Play, wherein nothing, juſtly, can be condemned, by the Rules of Religion and Vertue. I am, therefore, not afraid, to be try'd by good Chriſtians; and, I hope, to paſs uncenſured by good Criticks alſo, notwithſtanding the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Manner, in which, I have attempted it.</p>
            <p>Five Acts, I know, are Cuſtomary: But they can, by no means, be proved neceſſary. On the Contrary, if any determinate Number were to be appointed, as a Standard, <hi>Three Acts</hi> ſeem bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Five,</hi> by the Critick's own Rule. A <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> a <hi>Middle,</hi> and an <hi>End,</hi> ſay theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, are the Stages of the Drama. A firſt Act, then, would open, and prepare, the Matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. A Second would perfect, and heighten it to its Summit; and the Third, in a juſt, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Deſcent, ſerves to clear up the Embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:1269802300:9"/>
and bring on the Cataſtrophe. Thus, may <hi>Three</hi> Acts he defended by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> better than <hi>Five</hi> from <hi>Cuſtom:</hi> But I intend not, hereby to promote the Introduction of a new Manner.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Tragedy</hi> was writ ſo ſhort, for want of Time to enlarge it, by Addition of other Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Epiſodical Incidents; yet, becauſe I would not be ſubject to the Reproaches of miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Petulance, I thought it neceſſary to obſerve, that if a <hi>dramatic</hi> Story is compleat, in its <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Progreſs,</hi> and <hi>Concluſion,</hi> it is of no great Importance, what Number of Acts it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of.</p>
            <p>But one general Error, if I miſtake not, among Writers of <hi>TRAGEDY,</hi> is a Failure in their very <hi>Principle.</hi> They teach not a <hi>Moral,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſome Piece of <hi>Hiſtory.—</hi>The Buſineſs of the <hi>STAGE,</hi> if I apprehend it rightly, is, firſt, to intend ſome general and uſeful <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> how Men may avoid certain Miſchiefs in Life, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting thoſe Paſſions, which muſt naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them; and then, to find, or invent, ſome <hi>Story,</hi> which may ſerve as an <hi>Example,</hi> for ſtrengthening that <hi>Precept,</hi> and ſhew a Man made miſerable by Effect of thoſe Paſſions, which the Writer would teach his Audience to reſiſt, or keep Guard againſt. Every Thing, in a <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> which has not a direct, and viſible, Tendency to the Moral it is writ for, is ſuperfluous, and monſtrous; and, however pompouſly embelliſhed, ſerves for nothing, but to weaken the Inſtruction,
<pb facs="tcp:1269802300:10"/>
and diſtract the Attention, and Apprehenſion, of an Audience.</p>
            <p>I took the Hint (and only the Hint, as the Reader may ſee) of that Story, which I have fitted to the Moral of the following little Piece, from <hi>SHAKESPEAR'S Yorkſhire Tragedy,</hi> which was put into my Hands, on purpoſe, by my good Friend, Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> to whom I take this Occaſion of expreſſing my Gratitude, in the moſt publick manner I can; all Endeavours, beſide Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, being vain, to match the Inſtances of his Friendſhip, and that uncommon Humanity, and Frankneſs of Spirit, ſo peculiar to himſelf, in his manner of beſtowing Favours: But 'tis needleſs, to tell the World, how much I am oblig'd to him, and what juſt Senſe I have of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Regard to me. They, who know him well, and what a Waſte of his important Time he has made for my Intereſt, will be beforehand with my Acknowledgements, and enumerate the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which I could not miſs from his Friendſhip.—I owe much, in the Scheme, in the Sentiments, and Language, of this Piece, to the Direction of that accompliſhed Gentleman, who, has either no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or they are ſuch, becauſe Strangers to his good Qualities; for, 'tis only neceſſary to <hi>know</hi> him, to be, by Choice, or Obligation, made invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably his own.—I embrace this Opportunity of thanking him for his excellent Prologue, which ſo well prepared the Audience for the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor can I help thanking him even for the Epilogue, tho' not leſs pleaſant on my ſelf, than
<pb facs="tcp:1269802300:11"/>
on my Adverſaries among the <hi>Scots</hi> Clergy; for who would not be contented under a Stroke, or two, of his Satyr, whoſe <hi>Praiſe,</hi> (as <hi>Juba</hi> ſays of <hi>Cato)</hi> I would rather have, than Worlds for my Admirers.</p>
            <p>Before I end this Preface, I muſt not forget to thank the Generoſity of my Friends, of all Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, who, ſo nobly, grac'd the Action of my firſt Endeavour, in <hi>TRAGEDY.</hi> I ſhould have very little Merit, not to improve on ſuch Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.—Before ſo ſelect, and illuſtrious an Audience, the admirable Mrs. <hi>Seymour,</hi> and the Gentlemen, who ſo well performed the Parts, muſt have felt a Satisfaction, equal to that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, which their Action deſerved, and met with.</p>
