            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Comedy was begun at <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
in the Year 1728, and after
it had been sketched out into a few looſe
Scenes, was thrown by, and for a long
while no more thought of. It was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
writ for my private Amuſement;
as it would indeed have been little leſs
than Quixotiſm itſelf to hope any other
Fruits from attempting Characters wherein
the inimitable <hi>Cervantes</hi> ſo far excelled.
The Impoſſibility of going beyond, and the
extreme Difficulty of keeping pace with him,
were ſufficient to infuſe Deſpair into a very
adventurous Author.</p>
            <p>I ſoon diſcovered too, that my too ſmall
Experience in, and little Knowledge of the
World, had led me into an Error. I ſoon
found it infinitely more difficult than I
imagined, to vary the Scene, and give my
<pb facs="tcp:0048300600:9"/>
Knight an Opportunity of diſplaying himſelf
in a different manner from that wherein he
appears in the Romance. Human Nature
is every where the ſame. And the Modes
and Habits of particular Nations do not
change it enough, ſufficiently to diſtinguiſh
a <hi>Quixore</hi> in <hi>England</hi> from a <hi>Quixote</hi> in
<hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe Sentiments Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> concurred with me, who, upon
ſeeing the aforeſaid Sketch, both diſſuaded
me from ſuffering it to be repreſented on
the Stage; and accordingly it was reman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
back to my Shelf, where, probably, it
would have periſhed in Oblivion, had not
the Solicitations of the diſtreſt Actors in
<hi>Drury-Lane</hi> prevail'd on me to reviſe it,
at the ſame time that it came into my
Head to add thoſe Scenes concerning our
Elections.</p>
            <p>Being thus altered, it was often rehearſed
on that Theatre, and a particular Day
appointed for its Action; but the Giant
<hi>Cajanus,</hi> of a Race who were always
<pb facs="tcp:0048300600:10"/>
Enemies to our poor <hi>Don,</hi> deferred his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
ſo long, that the Intervention of
the Actor's Benefits would have put it off
till the next Seaſon, had I not brought it on
where now it appears.</p>
            <p>I have troubled the Reader thus long, to
account for this Comedy's appearing as it
now does, and that he might diſtinguiſh
thoſe Parts of it which were the Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Seaſon from thoſe which were
written in my more juvenile Years, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
moſt of the Pieces with which I have
endeavoured to entertain the Publick.</p>

               <p>NO Prologue, Sir! The Audience will never bear
it. They will not bate you any thing of their
due.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Auth.</speaker>
               <p>I am the Audience's very humble Servant;
but they cannot make a Man write a Prologue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can or no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, there is nothing eaſier: I have
known an Author bring three or four to the Houſe
with one Play, and give us our Choice which we
would ſpeak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Auth.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir; and I have now three in my Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
written by Friends, of which I chooſe none ſhould
be ſpoke.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>How ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Auth.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe they have been all ſpoke already twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
times over.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>Let me ſee them, pray.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Auth.</speaker>
               <p>They are written in ſuch damn'd cramp Hands,
you will never be able to read them; but I will tell
you the Subſtance of them. One of them begins with
abuſing the Writings of all my Cotemporaries, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
the fallen State of the Stage; and laſtly, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
the Audience that this Play was written with a
Deſign to reſtore true Taſte, and their approving it
is the beſt Symptom they can give of their having
any.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>Well, and a very good Scheme.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Auth.</speaker>
               <p>May be ſo; but it hath been the Subject of
almoſt every Prologue for theſe ten Years laſt paſt.
The Second is in a different Caſt: The firſt twelve
Lines inveigh againſt all Indecency on the Stage, and
the laſt twenty Lines ſhew you what it is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>That would do better for an Epilogue: But
what is the Third?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Auth.</speaker>
               <p>Why, the Third has ſome Wit in it, and
would have done very well, but for a Miſtake.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>Ay! What Miſtake?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Auth.</speaker>
               <p>Why, the Author never read my Play, and
taking it for a regular Comedy of Five Acts, hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
very ſeverely on Farce: However, it is a pretty
good one, and will do very well for the firſt genteel
Comedy you bring on the Stage.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>But don't you think a Play, with ſo odd a
Title as yours, requires to be a little explain'd? May
they not be too much ſurpris'd at ſome things?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Auth.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all. The Audience, I believe, are all
acquainted with the Character of <hi>Don Quixote</hi> and
<hi>Sancho.</hi> I have brought them over into <hi>England,</hi> and
introduced them at an Inn in the Country, where, I
believe, no one will be ſurpris'd that the Knight finds
ſeveral People as mad as himſelf. This I could have
told them in forty dull Lines, if I would, but I rather
choſe to let it alone; for, to tell you the Truth, I can
draw but one Concluſion from the Prologues I have
ever ſeen, that the Authors are ſo ſenſible of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits
of their Plays, that they deſire to ſet the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
aſleep before they begin: But of what real Uſe
is a Bill of Fare to any Entertainment, where the
Gueſts are not left to their Choice what Part they will
pick at, but are oblig'd to ſwallow the Whole indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently?</p>

               <speaker>Play.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, the Audience make ſuch a Noiſe with
their Canes, that, if we don't begin immediately, they
will beat the Houſe down before the Play begins; and
it is not adviſable to put them out of Humour, for
there are two or three of the loudeſt Cat-calls, in the
Gallery, that ever were heard.</p>

Children according to their Minds, not to their Births; theſe

when I ſee a Gentleman in his own Coach-box, I regret the
Loſs which ſome one has had of a Coachman; the Man who
toils all Day after a Partridge or a Pheaſant, might ſerve his
Country by toiling after a Plough; and when I ſee a low,
mean, tricking Lord, I lament the Loſs of an excellent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney.

not Fiſh that ſwims. Many a Man wants a Wife, but more
want to get rid of one. Two Cuckolds ſee each other's Horns
when neither of them can ſee his own. Money is the Fruit of
Evil, as often as the Root of it. Charity ſeldom goes out of her
own Houſe; and Ill-nature is always a rambling abroad. Every
Woman is a Beauty, if you will believe her own Glaſs; and
few, if you will believe her Neighbours.</p>

one Word he ſays. Our Curate was a Fool to e'en;
and yet he has talk'd what I could not underſtand neither, but
that's neither here nor there; an empty Purſe cauſes a full

                     <p>Nay, nay, he can't be choſe if he ſhould ſtand; for, to

that's worſe: But rather than it ſhould come to that, I would
ride all over the Kingdom for a Candidate; and if I thought
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> intended to ſteal us in this manner, he ſhould have

that way of Reaſoning; it ſavours too much of Bribery. I
like an Oppoſition, becauſe otherwiſe a Man may be oblig'd to
vote againſt his Party; therefore when we invite a Gentleman
to ſtand, we invite him to ſpend his Money for the Honour of
his Party; and when both Parties have ſpent as much as they
are able, every honeſt Man will vote according to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

                     <p>Ay, ay, Mr. <hi>Guzzle,</hi> I never gave a Vote contrary to

to all my Brethren: But before that, I recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Town-Intereſt, that is, the Intereſt of this Corporation;
and firſt of all I recommended to every particular Man to take
a particular Care of himſelf. And it is with a certain way of
Reaſoning, That he that ſerves me beſt, will ſerve the Town
beſt; and he that ſerves the Town beſt, will ſerve the Country
beſt.</p>

                        <hi>Sancho,</hi> I am not concern'd at the evil Opinion of
Men. Indeed, if we conſider who are their Favourites, we
ſhall have no reaſon to be ſo fond of their Applauſe. Virtue,
<hi>Sancho,</hi> is too bright for their Eyes, and they dare not behold
her. Hypocriſy is the Deity they worſhip. Is not the Lawyer
often call'd an honeſt Man, when for a ſneaking Fee he pleads
the Villain's Cauſe, or attempts to extort Evidence to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the Innocent? Does not the Phyſician live well in
his Neighbourhood, while he ſuffers them to bribe his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to their Deſtruction? But why ſhould I mention thoſe
whoſe Profeſſion 'tis to prey on others? Look thro' the World,
What is it recommends Men, but the Poverty, the Vice, and
the Miſery of others? This, <hi>Sancho,</hi> they are ſenſible of, and
therefore, inſtead of endeavouring to make himſelf better, each
Man endeavours to make his Neighbour worſe. Each Man ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to Admiration by treading on Mankind. Riches and Power
accrue to the One, by the Deſtruction of Thouſands. Theſe
are the general Objects of the good Opinion of Men: Nay,
and that which is profeſs'd to be paid to Virtue, is ſeldom more
to any thing than a ſupercilious Contempt of our Neighbour.
What is a good-natur'd Man? Why, one, who ſeeing the
Want of his Friend, cries he pities him. Is this real? No:
If it was, he would relieve him. His Pity is triumphant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
and Inſult: It ariſes from his Pride, not from his
Compaſſion. <hi>Sancho,</hi> let them call me mad; I'm not mad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to court their Approbation.</p>

I find there's nothing in making Love, when a Man's

                     <p>The uſual Madneſs of Mankind! Do you marry
your Daughter for her ſake, or your own? If for her's, ſure
'tis ſomething whimſical, to make her miſerable in order to
make her happy. Money is a Thing well worth conſidering in
theſe Affairs; but Parents always regard it too much, and Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
too little. No Match can be happy, which Love and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
do not conſpire to make ſo. The greateſt Addition of
either, illy ſupplies the intire Abſence of the other; nor wou'd
Millions a Year make that Beaſt, in your Daughter's Eye, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to this Youth with a Thouſand.</p>
