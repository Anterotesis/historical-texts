            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head type="sub">Painters in the Reign of Charles II.</head>
               <p>THE arts were in a manner expelled with the Royal Family
from Britain. The anecdotes of a Civil War are the hiſtory
of Deſtruction. In all ages the mob have vented their hatred
to Tyrants, on the pomp of Tyranny. The magnificence the people
have envied, they grow to deteſt, and miſtaking conſequences for
cauſes, the firſt objects of their fury are the palaces of their maſters.
If Religion is thrown into the quarrel, the moſt innocent arts are cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logued
with ſins. This was the caſe in the conteſts between Charles
and his parliament. As he had blended affection to the ſciences with
a luſt of power, nonſenſe and ignorance were adopted into the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the ſubject. Painting became idolatry; monuments were
deemed carnal pride, and a venerable cathedral ſeemed equally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to Magna Charta and the Bible. Learning and wit were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued
to be ſo heathen, that one would have thought the Holy Ghoſt
could endure nothing above a pun. What the fury of Henry VIII.
had ſpared, was condemned by the Puritans: Ruin was their harveſt,
and they gleaned after the Reformers. Had they countenanced any
of the ſofter arts, what could thoſe arts have repreſented? How pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0853300503:3"/>
was the figure of an Anabaptiſt? But ſectaries have no oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
enjoyments; their pleaſures are private, comfortable and groſs.
The arts that civilize ſociety are not calculated for men who mean to
riſe on the ruins of eſtabliſhed order. Jargon and auſterities are the
weapons that beſt ſerve the purpoſes of hereſiarcs and innovators. The
ſciences have been excommunicated from the Gnoſtics to Mr.
Whitfield.</p>
               <p>The reſtoration of royalty brought back the arts, not taſte. Charles
II. had a turn to mechanics, none to the politer ſciences. He had
learned <note n="*" place="bottom">See before, vol. ii. p. 109.</note> to draw in his youth; in the imperial library at Vienna is
a view of the iſle of Jerſey, deſigned by him; but he was too indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
even to amuſe himſelf. He introduced the faſhions of the court
of France, without it's elegance. He had ſeen Louis XIV. counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
Corneille, Moliere, Boileau, Le Sueur, who forming themſelves
on the models of the ancients, ſeemed by the purity of their writings
to have ſtudied only in <note n="†" place="bottom">It has been objected by ſome perſons that the expreſſion of <hi>ſtudying in Sparta</hi> is improper, as the Spartans were an illiterate people and produced no authors. A Criticiſm I think very ill-founded. The purity of the French writers, not their learning, is the object of the text. Many men travelled to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon to ſtudy the laws and inſtitutions of Lycurgus. Men viſit all countries, under the pretence at leaſt of ſtudying the reſpective manners: nor have I ever heard before that the term <hi>ſtudying</hi> was reſtricted to meer reading. When I ſay an author wrote as chaſtly as if he had ſtudied only in Sparta, is it not evident that I meaned his morals, not his information, were formed on the pureſt models?</note> Sparta. Charles found as much genius at
home, but how licentious, how indelicate was the ſtyle he permitted or
demanded! Dryden's tragedies, are a compound of bombaſt and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic
obſcenity, incloſed in the moſt beautiful numbers. If Wycherley
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0853300503:4"/>
had nature, it is nature ſtark naked. The painters of that time veiled
it but little more; Sir Peter Lely ſcarce ſaves appearances but by a bit
of fringe or embroidery. His nymphs, generally repoſed on the turf,
are too wanton and too magnificent to be taken for any thing but
maids of honour. Yet fantaſtic as his compoſitions ſeem, they were
pretty much in the dreſs of the times, as is evident by a puritan tract
publiſhed in 1678, and intituled, "Juſt and reaſonable Reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of naked Breaſts and Shoulders." The court had gone a good
way beyond the faſhion of the preceding reign, when the galantry in
vogue was to wear a lock of ſome favorite object; and yet Prynne had
thought that mode ſo damnable, that he publiſhed an abſurd piece
againſt it, called, The Unlovelineſs of Love-locks <note n="*" place="bottom">At the ſale of the late lady Worſeley, was the portrait of the ducheſs of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet, daughter of Robert earl of Eſſex, [Q. Elizabeth's favorite] with a lock of her father's hair hanging on her neck; and the lock itſelf was in the ſame auction.</note>.</p>
               <p>The ſectaries, in oppoſition to the king, had run into the extreme
againſt politeneſs: The new court, to indemnify themſelves and mark
averſion to their rigid adverſaries, took the other extreme. Elegance
and delicacy were the point from which both ſides ſtarted different
ways; and taſte was as little ſought by the men of wit, as by thoſe
who called themſelves the men of God. The latter thought that to
demoliſh was to reform; the others, that ridicule was the only rational
corrective; and thus while one party deſtroyed all order, and the
other gave a looſe to diſorder, no wonder the age produced ſcarce any
work of art, that was worthy of being preſerved by poſterity, Yet
in a hiſtory of the arts, as in other hiſtories, the times of confuſion and
barbariſm muſt have their place to preſerve the connection, and to
aſcertain the ebb and flow of genius. One likes to ſee through what
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0853300503:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
clouds broke forth the age of Auguſtus. The pages that follow will
preſent the reader with few memorable names; the number muſt
atone for merit, if that can be thought any atonement. The firſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Vertue was told by old Mr. Laroon, who ſaw him in Yorkſhire, that the celebrated Rembrandt was in England in 1661, and lived 16 or 18 months at Hull, where he drew ſeveral gentlemen and ſeafaring perſons. Mr. Dahl had one of thoſe pictures. There are two fine whole lengths at Yarmouth, which might be done at the ſame time. As there is no other evidence of Rembrandt being in England, it was not neceſſary to make a ſeperate article for him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at a time when he is ſo well known, and his works in ſuch repute, that his ſcratches, with the difference only of a black horſe or a white one, ſell for thirty guineas.</note>
perſon who made any figure, and who was properly a remnant of a
better age, was</p>
               <p>ISAAC FULLER,</p>
               <p>Of his family or maſters, I find no account, except that he ſtudied
many years in France under Perrier, who engraved the antique
ſtatues. Graham ſays "he wanted the regular improvements of
travel to conſider the antiques, and underſtood the anatomic part of
painting, perhaps equal to Michael Angelo, following it ſo cloſe,
that he was very apt to make the muſcelling too ſtrong and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent."
But this writer was not aware that the very fault he objects
to Fuller did not proceed from not having ſeen the antiques, but from
having ſeen them too partially, and that he was only to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Michael Angelo from a ſimilitude of errors, flowing from a
ſimilitude of ſtudy. Each caught the robuſt ſtyle from ancient ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
without attaining it's graces. If Graham had avoided hyperbole,

<figure>
                     <pb facs="tcp:0853300503:6"/>
                     <head>ISAAC FULLER.</head>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0853300503:7"/>
he had not fallen into a blunder. In his hiſtoric compoſitions Fuller
is a wretched painter, his colouring was raw and unnatural, and not
compenſated by diſpoſition or invention. In portraits his pencil was
bold, ſtrong, and maſterly: Men who ſhine in the latter, and miſcarry
in the former, want imagination. They ſucceed only in what they ſee.
Liotard is a living inſtance of this ſterility. He cannot paint a blue
ribband if a lady is dreſſed in purple knots. If he had been in the
priſon at the death of Socrates, and the paſſions were as permanent as
the perſons on whom they act, he might have made a finer picture
than Nicolò Pouſſin.</p>
               <p>Graham ſpeaks of Fuller as extravagant and burleſque in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and ſays, that they influenced the ſtyle of his works <note n="*" place="bottom">Elſum in an epigram, that is not one of his worſt, agrees with this opinion;
On a drunken Sot,
His head does on his ſhoulder lean,
His eyes are ſunk and hardly ſeen;
Who ſees this ſot in his own colour
Is apt to ſay, 'twas done by Fuller.</note>. The
former character ſeems more true than the latter. I have a picture
of Ogleby by him, in which he certainly has not debaſed his ſubject,
but has made Ogleby appear a moonſtruck bard, inſtead of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
one. The compoſition has more of Salvator than of Brau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.
His own <note n="†" place="bottom">It is much damaged, and was given to the Univerſity by Dr. Clarke.</note> portrait in the gallery at Oxford is capricious, but
touched with great force and character. His altar-pieces at <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. Addiſon wrote a latin poem in praiſe of it.</note> Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen
and All-ſouls colleges in Oxford are deſpicable. At Wadham
college is an altar-cloth in a ſingular manner, and of merit: It is juſt
bruſhed over for the lights and ſhades, and the colours melted in with
a hot iron. He painted too the inſide of St. Mary Abchurch in Canon-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0853300503:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
While Fuller was at Oxford he drew ſeveral portraits, and copied
Dobſon's decollation of St. John, but varying the faces from real per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
For Herodias, who held the charger, he painted his own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs;
her mother for the old woman receiving the head in a bag, and
the ruffian, who cut it off, was a noted bruiſer of that age. There was
beſides a little boy with a torch, which illuminated the whole picture.
Fuller received 60 pieces for it. In king James's catalogue is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
a picture by him, repreſenting Fame and Honour treading
down Envy. Colonel Seymour <note n="*" place="bottom">Vertue bought it, and from his ſale I purchaſed it.</note> had a head of Pierce, the carver,
by Fuller. He was much employed to paint the great taverns <note n="†" place="bottom">Sir P. Lely ſeeing a portrait of Norris, the king's frame-maker, an old grey-headed man, finely painted by Fuller, lamented that ſuch a genius ſhould drown his talents in wine.</note> in
London; particularly the mitre in Fenchurch-ſtreet, where he adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the ſides of a great room in pannels, as was then the faſhion.
The figures were as large as life; a Venus, Satyr and ſleeping Cupid;
a boy riding a goat and another fallen down, over the chimney; this
was the beſt part of the performance, ſays Vertue; Saturn devouring
a child, Mercury, Minerva, Diana, Apollo; and Bacchus, Venus, and
Ceres embracing; a young Silenus fallen down, and holding a goblet,
into which a boy was pouring wine; the ſeaſons between the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
and on the ceiling two angels ſupporting a mitre, in a large
circle; this part was very bad, and the colouring of the Saturn too
raw, and his figure too muſcular. He painted five very large pictures,
the hiſtory of the king's eſcape after the battle of Worceſter; they
coſt a great ſum, but were little eſteemed.</p>
               <p>Vertue had ſeen two books with etchings by Fuller; the firſt, Caeſar
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0853300503:9"/>
Ripa's Emblems; ſome of the plates by Fuller, others by Henry
Cooke and Tempeſta. The ſecond was called, Libro da Diſegnare;
8 or 10 of the plates by our painter.</p>
               <p>He died in Bloomſbury-ſquare, July 17, 1672, and left a ſon, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
but idle man, according to Vertue, chiefly employed in coach-painting.
He led a diſſolute life and died young.</p>
               <p>Fuller had one Scholar, Charles Woodfield; who entered under him
at Oxford, and ſerved ſeven years. He generally painted views,
buildings, monuments, and antiquities, but being as idle as his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
ſon, often wanted neceſſaries. He died ſuddenly in his chair in
the year 1724, at the age of 75.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS BOLL,</p>
               <p>A painter of whom I find no particulars, but that he made views of
London before the fire, which proves that he was here early in this
reign if not in the laſt; theſe views were at Sutton-place in Surrey,
and repreſented Arundel-houſe, Somerſet-houſe and the Tower.
Vertue, who ſaw them, ſays, they were in a good free taſte.</p>
               <p>JOHN FREEMAN,</p>
               <p>An hiſtoric painter, was a rival of Fuller, which ſeems to have been
his greateſt glory. He was thought to have been poiſoned in the
Weſt-indies, but however died in England, after having been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in painting ſcenes for the theatre in Covent-garden <note n="*" place="bottom">Graham p. 419.</note>.

the works of Vandyck; he imitated too with ſucceſs the Flemiſh

himſelf. I have already mentioned his ſmall picture from Holbein,
of the two Henrys and their queens, and that his purchaſe in king
Charles's ſale of the king on horſeback was taken from him, by a ſuit
at law, after he had demanded 1500 guineas for it at Antwerp and
been bid 1000. The earl of Pomfret at Eaſton had a copy of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael's
Galatea by him, and at Penſhurſt is a ſmall whole length of
Francis earl of Bedford aet. 48, 1636, from Vandyck. Mr. Stevens,
hiſtoriographer to the king, had ſome portraits of his family painted
by Remèe. The latter had a well-choſen collection of prints and
drawings <note n="*" place="bottom">Graham, p. 458.</note>. He died in Nov. 1675, and was buried in the church-yard
of Covent-garden, as his ſon Charles had been in 1651. His daughter

that Streater's being a good hiſtorian contributed not a little to his
perfection in that way of painting. He might as well ſay that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Rape of the Lock would make one a good hair-cutter. I
ſhould rely more on Sanderſon, who ſpeaking of landſcape, ſays "of
our own nation I know none more excellent but Streater, who indeed

countrymen with foreigners, in different branches, he adds, "Streater

hand, I can by no means ſubſcribe to theſe encomiums: The Theatre
at Oxford, his principal performance, is a very mean one; yet Streater
was as much commended for it, as by the authors I have mentioned
for his works in general. One Robert Whitehall <note n="¶" place="bottom">V. Wood's Athenae, vol. ii. p. 786. A deſcription in proſe of that paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in the new Oxford-guide.</note>, a poetaſter of

were ſold by auction. Among them were the following by Streater

               <p>Was diſciple of Streater, whoſe manner he followed in landſcape and

portrait-painting, and having drawn the famous Mrs. Stuart, ducheſs

He painted ſtill-life, oranges and lemons, plate, damaſk curtains,

earl of Radnor, who at his houſe in St. James's ſquare, had near
eighteen or twenty of his works, over doors and chimnies, &amp;c.
there was one large piece, loaded with fruit, flowers, and dead game
by him, and his own portrait in it, painted by Laguerre, with a
hawk on his fiſt. The ſtair-caſe of that houſe was painted by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerre,

               <p>Was another of thoſe painters of ſtill life, a manner at that time in
faſhion. It was not known that he had been in England, till Vertue
diſcovered it by a picture of his hand at a ſale in Covent-garden 1730.
The ground repreſented a walnut-tree board, with papers, pens, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife
and an Engliſh almanack of the year 1663, a gold medal, and
the portrait of the author in a ſuppoſed ebony frame, long hair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to red, and his name, S. V. Hoogſtraten. The circumſtance
of the Engliſh almanack makes it probable that this painter was in
England at leaſt in that year, and Vertue found it confirmed by Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braken
his ſcholar, who in his lives <note n="*" place="bottom">There is alſo an account of him in the ſecond volume of Deſcamps, which was publiſhed but a little time before the death of Vertue.</note> of the painters ſays, that Hoog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraten

was bold and free, and except Rubens and Snyder, few maſters have
painted animals in ſo great a ſtyle. Though he drew both figures
and landſcape, dogs and huntings were his favorite ſubjects. Vertue
ſays he was a man of humour, and that one of his maxims was, that
the goods of other men might be uſed as our own; and that finding
another man's wife of the ſame mind, he took and kept her till ſhe
died; after which he married. He lived on Ludgate-hill, but died
of a ſevere courſe of the gout in 1695, at the blackmore's head over-againſt
Water-lane Fleet-ſtreet. One of his firſt pictures was the
burning of Troy; and he frequently painted candle-lights. His
beſt was a dog-market, ſold at Mr. Halſted's auction in 1726: Above
on ſteps were men and women well executed. My father had two
large pieces of his hand, the one a boar, the other a ſtag-hunting,
very capital. Vertue mentions beſides a landſcape painted in 1666;
Diana returned from hunting, and a bull-baiting, dated 1678.</p>

Jodocus Hondius, probably the grand-father of Abraham, had

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0853300503:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lys or Lely, which became the proper name of the ſon. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his firſt inſtructions in painting from one De Grebber, and
began with landſcape and hiſtoric figures leſs than life; but coming
to England in 1641, and ſeeing the works of Vandyck, he quitted
his former ſtyle and former ſubjects, and gave himſelf wholly to
portraits in emulation of that great man. His ſucceſs was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
though not equal to his ambition; if in nothing but ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
he fell ſhort of his model, as Statius or Claudian did of Virgil.
If Vandyck's portraits are often tame and ſpiritleſs, at leaſt they are
natural. His laboured draperies flow with eaſe, and not a fold but
is placed with propriety. Lely ſupplied the want of taſte with clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quant;
his nymphs trail fringes and embroidery through meadows

Varelſt, patronized by the duke of Buckingham; from Gaſcar who
was brought over by the ducheſs of Portſmouth; and from the riſing
merit of Kneller, whom the French author I have mentioned, ſets
with little reaſon far below Sir Peter. Both had too little variety in

in finiſhing. The latter ſhowed by his pains how high he could

arrive: It is plain that if Sir Godfrey had painted much leſs and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
more, he would have been the greater maſter. This perhaps
is as true a parallel, as the French author's, who thinks that Kneller
might have diſputed with Lely in the beauty of his head of hair.
Deſcamps is ſo weak as to impute Sir Peter's death to his jealouſy of
Kneller, though he owns it was almoſt ſudden; an account which is
almoſt nonſenſe, eſpecially as he adds that Lely's phyſician, who knew
not the cauſe of his malady, heightened it by repetitions of Kneller's

He gave a plan for rebuilding London after the fire; but though it was not accepted, he got a large ſum of money, as one of the commiſſioners, from the perſons who claimed the ſeveral diſtributions of the ground, and this money he locked up in an iron cheſt for thirty years.

Sir Peter Lely employed him for his back-grounds, A ſingle ceiling
of his was at Mr. Kent's at Cauſham, in Wiltſhire near Bath. He
ſometimes drew from the life, and imitated the manner of Titian, in

a grace for beauty, and a muſe for wit. Dryden has celebrated her
genius for painting and poetry in a very long ode, in which the rich
ſtream of his numbers has hurried along with it all that his luxuriant
fancy produced in his way; it is an harmonious hyperbole compoſed
of the fall of Adam, Arethuſa, Veſtal Virgins, Diana, Cupid, Noah's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark,
the Pleiades, the valley of Jehoſaphat and the laſt Aſſizes: Yet
Antony Wood aſſures us "there is nothing ſpoken of her, which ſhe
was not equal to, if not ſuperior;" and his proof is as wiſe as his
aſſertion, for, ſays he, "if there had not been more true hiſtory in
her praiſes, than compliment, her father would never have ſuffered
them to paſs the preſs." She was maid of honour to the ducheſs of
York, and died of the ſmall-pox in 1685, in the 25th year of her

Sueur and Le Brun, the latter of whom adviſed him to adhere to
portraits for which he had a particular talent. The French author <note n="*" place="bottom">Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres, vol. ii. p. 329.</note>,
from whom I tranſcribe, ſays that in that ſtyle he equalled the beſt
maſters of that country, and that paſſing into England he was
reckoned a ſecond Vandyck. If he was thought ſo then, it is entirely
forgotten. Both Graham and Vertue knew ſo little of him, that the
firſt mentions him not, and the latter confounded him with Valentine
Le Fevre of Bruſſels, who never was here; yet mentions a mezzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tint
of Alexandre Boudan imprimeur du roi, done at Paris by Sarabe,
the eyes of which were printed in blue and the face and hands in fleſh-colour.
From hence I conclude that Graham made another miſtake
in his account of</p>
               <p>LE FEVRE DE VENISE,</p>
               <p>Whoſe chriſtian name was Roland, and who he ſays gained the favour
of prince Rupert by a ſecret of ſtaining marble. As that prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
mezzotinto, I conclude it was Claude who learned it of his
highneſs, during his intercourſe with him, and communicated it to
Sarabe at Paris. Le Fevre de Veniſe certainly was in England and
died here, as Claude did. Vertue ſays that his Le Fevre painted
chiefly portraits and hiſtories in ſmall, in the manner of Vandyck,
the latter of which were not always very decent. As I am deſirous of
adjuſting the pretenſions of the three Le Fevres, and ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to attribute to either of the wrong what his modeſty might
make him decline, I mean the laſt article, I am inclined to beſtow the
nudities on Roland, qui ſe plaiſoit, ſays <note n="†" place="bottom">Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres, vol. ii. p. 331.</note> my author, à deſſiner

               <p>Claude died in 1675 at the age of forty-two; Roland died in Bear-ſtreet
near Leiceſter-fields in 1677, about the 69th year of his age,
and was buried at St. Martin's.</p>
               <p>Mercier, painter to the late prince of Wales, bought at an auction
the portrait of Le Fevre, in a ſpotted-furr-cap, with a pallet in his

               <p>Remarkable for copying Vandyck well, and for being a rival of Lely.
A portrait of himſelf in water-colours, purchaſed by colonel Seymour
at Mr. Bryan's ſale, ill drawn but ſtrongly coloured, induced Vertue
to think that Lely was not the only perſon whom Hayls had an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to rival, but that this was a firſt eſſay in competition with
Cooper. However I find by a note in a different volume, that ſome
thought this miniature was by Hoſkins. At Woburn is the portrait
of colonel John Ruſſel, (of whom there is a better picture in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires
de Grammont) third ſon of Francis earl of Bedford; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of lady Diana, ſecond daughter of William the firſt duke of that
houſe, both by Hayls, and he drew the father of ſecretary Pepys. He
lived in Southampton-ſtreet Bloomſbury, and dying there ſuddenly in
1679, was buried in St. Martin's.

               <p>Another competitor of Sir Peter, was a French portrait-painter, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized
by the ducheſs of Portſmouth, and in compliment to her
much encouraged. Graham ſpeaks of his tawdry ſtyle, which was
more the fault of the age than of the painter. The pomp of Louis
XIV. infected Europe; and Gaſcar, whoſe buſineſs was to pleaſe,
ſucceeded as well in Italy as he had in England, from whence he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
above 10,000<hi>l.</hi> At Cheſterton Vertue ſaw a head in armour
of Edmund Verney, with Gaſcar's name to it. His beſt performance
was a half length at lord Pomfret's of Philip earl of Pembroke,
which he drew by ſtealth, by order of his patroneſs, whoſe ſiſter
lord Pembroke had married. I ſuppoſe this deſire of having her
brother-in-law's picture was dated before a quarrel ſhe had with him
for ill-uſage of her ſiſter: The ducheſs threatened to complain to the
king; the earl told her, if ſhe did, he would ſet her upon her head at
Charing-croſs, and ſhow the nation it's grievance.</p>
               <p>SIMON VARELST,</p>
               <p>A real ornament of Charles's reign, and one of the few who have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at capital excellence in that branch of the art, was a Dutch
flower-painter. It is not certain in what year he arrived in England;
his works were extremely admired, and his prices the greateſt that had
been known in this country. The duke of Buckingham patronized
him, but having too much wit to be only beneficent, and perceiving
the poor man to be immoderately vain, he piqued him to attempt
portraits. Varelſt thinking nothing impoſſible to his pencil, fell into
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0853300503:44"/>
the ſnare, and drew the duke himſelf, but crouded it ſo much with
fruits and ſun-flowers, that the king, to whom it was ſhowed, took it
for a flower-piece. However, as it ſometimes happens to wiſer buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons
than Varelſt, he was laughed at till he was admired, and Sir
Peter Lely himſelf became the real ſacrifice to the jeſt: he loſt much
of his buſineſs, and retired to Kew, while Varelſt engroſſed the faſhion,
and for one half length was paid an hundred and ten pounds. His
portraits were exceedingly laboured, and finiſhed with the ſame deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
as his flowers, which he continued to introduce into them.
Lord chancellor Shaftſbury going to ſit, was received by him with his
hat on. Don't you know me? ſaid the peer. Yes, replied the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
you are my lord chancellor. And do you know me? I am Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſt.
The king can make any man chancellor, but he can make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
a Varelſt. Shaftſbury was diſguſted and ſat to Greenhill. In
1680 Varelſt, his brother Harman, Henny and Parmentiere, all
painters, went to Paris, but ſtaid not long. In 1685 Varelſt was a
witneſs on the divorce between the duke and ducheſs of Norfolk;
one who had married Varelſt's half ſiſter was brought to ſet aſide his
evidence, and depoſed his having been mad and confined. He was
ſo, but not much more than others of his profeſſion have been; his
lunacy was ſelf-admiration; he called himſelf the <note n="*" place="bottom">

two or three hours. Being repulſed, he ſaid, "He is king of
England, I am king of painting, why ſhould not we converſe together
familiarly?" He ſhowed an hiſtoric piece on which he had laboured
twenty years, and boaſted that it contained the ſeveral manners and
excellencies of Raphael, Titian, Rubens, and Vandyck. When Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſt,

Varelſt was ſhut up towards the end of his life, but recovered his
ſenſes at laſt, not his genius, and lived to a great age, certainly as late
as 1710, and died in Suffolk-ſtreet. In king James's collection were
ſix of his hand, the king, queen, and ducheſs of Portſmouth, half
lengths, a landſcape, flowers, and fruit: In lord Pomfret's were nine
flower-pieces.</p>
               <p>His brother Harman Varelſt lived ſome time at Vienna, till the
Turks beſeiged it in 1683. He painted hiſtory, fruit and flowers,
and dying about 1700 was buried in St. Andrew's Holbourn. He
left a ſon of his profeſſion called Cornelius, and a very accompliſhed
daughter, who painted in oil, and drew ſmall hiſtories, portraits both
in large and ſmall, underſtood muſic, and ſpoke Latin, German, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
and other languages.</p>
               <p>ANTONIO VERRIO,</p>
               <p>A Neapolitan; an excellent painter for the ſort of ſubjects on which
he was employed, that is, without much invention, and with leſs taſte,
his exuberant pencil was ready at pouring our gods, goddeſſes, kings,
emperors and triumphs, over thoſe public ſurfaces on which the eye
never reſts long enough to criticize, and where one ſhould be ſorry to
place the works of a better maſter, I mean, cielings and ſtair-caſes.

The New Teſtament or the Roman Hiſtory coſt him nothing but
ultra-marine; that and marble columns, and marble ſteps he never
ſpared. He firſt ſettled in France, and painted the high altar of the
Carmelites at Thoulouſe, which is deſcribed in Du Puy's Traitè ſur la
Peinture, p. 219. Thoul. 1699.</p>
               <p>Charles II. having a mind to revive the manufacture of tapeſtry at
Mortlack, which had been interrupted by the civil war, ſent for Verrio
to England; but changing his purpoſe, conſigned over Windſor to
his pencil. The king was induced to this by ſeeing ſome of his paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at lord Arlington's, at the end of St. James's-park, where at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtands Buckingham-houſe. The firſt picture Verrio drew for
the king was his majeſty in naval triumph, now in the public dining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room
in the caſtle. He executed moſt of the ceilings there, one whole
ſide of St. George's-hall, and the chapel. On the ceiling of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
he has pictured Antony earl of Shaftſbury, in the character of Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
diſperſing libels; as in another place he revenged a private quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel

The king's bounty did not ſtop here; Verrio had a place of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-gardiner,
and a lodging at the end of the park, now Carleton-houſe.
He was expenſive, and kept a great table, and often preſſed
the king for money with a freedom which his majeſty's own frankneſs
indulged. Once at Hampton-court, when he had but lately received
an advance of a thouſand pounds, he found the king in ſuch a circle
that he could not approach. He called out, Sire, I deſire the favour
of ſpeaking to your majeſty.—Well, Verrio, ſaid the king, what is
your requeſt? Money, Sir, I am ſo ſhort in caſh, that I am not able
to pay my workmen, and your majeſty and I have learned by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that pedlars and painters cannot give credit long. The king
ſmiled, and ſaid he had but lately ordered him 1000<hi>l.</hi> Yes, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
he, but that was ſoon paid away, and I have no gold left. At
that rate, ſaid the king, you would ſpend more than I do, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
my family. True, anſwered Verrio, but does your majeſty keep
an open table as I do?</p>
               <p>He gave the deſigns for the large equeſtrian picture of that monarch
in the hall at Chelſea-college; but it was finiſhed by Cook, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by lord Ranelagh.</p>
               <p>On the acceſſion of James II. Verrio was again employed at Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
in Wolſey's Tomb-houſe, then deſtined for a Romiſh-chapel. He
painted that king and ſeveral of his courtiers, in the hoſpital of
Chriſt-church London. Among other portraits there is Dr. Hawes,
a phyſician; Vertue ſaw the original head from whence he tranſlated
it into the great piece, which Verrio preſented to the hoſpital. He
painted too at that of St. Bartholomew.</p>
               <p>The revolution was by no means agreable to Verrio's religion or
principles. He quitted his place, and even refuſed to work for king
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0853300503:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
William. From that time he was for ſome years employed at the lord
Exeter's at Burleigh, and afterwards at Chatſworth. At the former
he painted ſeveral chambers, which are reckoned among his beſt
works. He has placed his own portrait in the room where he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the hiſtory of Mars and Venus; and for the Bacchus beſtriding
a hogſhead, he has, according to his uſual liberty <note n="*" place="bottom">It was more excuſable, that when his patron obliged him to inſert a pope, in a proceſſion not very honorable to the Romiſh religion, he added the portrait of the archbiſhop of Canterbury then living.</note>, borrowed the
countenance of a dean, with whom he was at variance. At Chatſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
is much of his hand. The altar-piece in the chapel is the beſt
piece I ever ſaw of his; the ſubject, the incredulity of St. Thomas.
He was employed too at Lowther-hall, but the houſe has been burnt.
At laſt by perſuaſion of lord Exeter he condeſcended to ſerve king
William, and was ſent to Hampton-court, where among other things
he painted the great ſtair-caſe, and as ill, as if he had ſpoiled it out
of principle. His eyes failing him *, queen Anne gave him a penſion
of 200<hi>l.</hi> a year for life, but he did not enjoy it long, dying at
Hampton-court in 1707.</p>
               <p>Scheffers of Utrecht was employed by Verrio for twenty-five years.
At his firſt arrival he had worked for picture-ſellers. Lanſcron was
another painter in Verrio's ſervice, and aſſiſted him ſeven or eight
years at Windſor.
<note n="†" place="bottom">It was not only this decay, but his death that prevented his being employed at Blenheim, as probably was intended, for the author of ſome verſes addreſſed to Verrio in the ſixth volume of Dryden's miſcellanies, carried his prophetic imagination ſo far as to behold the duke's triumphs repreſented there by our painter; who died before the houſe was built.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Was born at Antwerp in 1656, and ſtudied under Bakerel, a ſcholar
of Rubens, and competitor of Vandyck. Bakerel was a poet too,
and a ſatyric one, and having writ an invective againſt the Jeſuits,
was obliged to fly. Huyſman, deprived of his maſter, came to
England, and painted both hiſtory and portraits. In the latter he
rivalled Sir Peter Lely, and with reaſon. His picture of lady Byron
over the chimney in the beauty-room at Windſor, is at leaſt as highly
finiſhed and coloured with as much force as Sir Peter's works in that
chamber, tho' the <note n="†" place="bottom">I find in Vertue's notes that he had been told it is not lady Byron, but lady Bellaſſis. If it was the lady Bellaſſis, who was miſtreſs to king James, it becomes more valuable, and while Charles paid his brother the compliment of enrolling the latter's miſtreſs with his own, he tacitly inſinuated how much better a taſte he had himſelf.

her like St. Catherine. King James <note n="‡" place="bottom">See his catalogue. There too is mentioned the ducheſs of Richmond in man's apparel by Huyſman. It is a pretty picture, now at Kenſington: the dreſs is that of a Cavalier about the time of the civil war, buff with blue ribbands.</note> had another in the dreſs of a
ſhepherdeſs; and there is a third in Painter's-hall. He created
himſelf the queen's painter, and to juſtify it, made her ſit for every
Madonna or Venus that he drew. His capital work was over the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0853300503:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
altar of her chapel at St. James's, now the French church. He died
in 1696, and was buried in St. James's-church.</p>
               <p>Vertue mentions another painter of the ſame ſurname, whom he
calls Michlaer Huyſman of Mecklin, and ſays he lived at Antwerp;
that he ſtudied the Italians, and painted landſcapes in their manner,
which he adorned with buildings and animals. He came to England,
and brought two large landſcapes, which he kept to ſhew what he
could do; for theſe he had frames richly carved by Gibbons, and
gave the latter two pictures in exchange. In a ſale in 1743 Vertue
ſaw three ſmall landſcapes and figures by him of great merit. On
the revolution he returned to Antwerp, and died there 1707, aged
near 70.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL WRIGHT,</p>
               <p>Was born in Scotland, but came to London at the age of 16 or 17,
and proved no bad portrait-painter. In 1672 he drew for Sir Robert
Vyner a whole length of prince Rupert in armour with a large wig.
On the back he wrote the prince's titles at length, and his own name
thus, Jo. Michael Wright Lond. pictor regius pinxit 1672. The earl
of Oxford had a half length by him of Sir Edward Turner, ſon of
Sir Edward, ſpeaker of the Houſe of Commons and chief baron. On
that he called himſelf Joſ. Michael Wright <hi>Anglus,</hi> 1672, but on the
portraits of the judges in Guildhall he wrote <hi>Scotus.</hi> Sir Peter Lely
was to have drawn theſe pictures, but refuſing to wait on the judges
at their own chambers, Wright got the buſineſs, and received 60<hi>l.</hi> for
each piece. Two of his moſt admired works were a highland laird
and an Iriſh tory, whole lengths in their proper dreſſes, of which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0853300503:53"/>
copies were made. At Windſor is his large picture of John
Lacy the comedian in three different characters, Parſon Scruple in
the Cheats, Sandy in the Taming of the Shrew, and Monſieur de
Vice in the Country Captain. It was painted in 1675, and ſeveral
copies taken from it. He twice drew a duke of Cambridge ſon of
king James <note n="*" place="bottom">V. catalogue.</note>, perhaps the two children who bore that title; one of
them is in the king's cloſet at St. James's. He painted too a cieling
in the king's bedchamber at Whitehall.</p>
               <p>Wright attended Roger Palmer earl of Caſtlemain, as ſteward of
his houſhold, on his embaſſy to the Pope, <note n="†" place="bottom">It is well known with what neglect and indifference this Embaſſy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Pope. The Jeſuits endeavoured to compenſate for the Pontiff's contempt: they treated Caſtlemaine in a moſt magnificent manner, and all the arts were called in to demonſtrate their zeal, and compliment the bigot-monarch. But the good fathers were unlucky in ſome of their inſcriptions, which furniſhed ample matter for ridicule; particularly ſpeaking of James, they ſaid, <hi>Alas Carolo addidit</hi>; and that the former might chuſe an Embaſſador worthy of ſending to heaven, <hi>He diſpatched his brother.</hi> V. Hiſt. of England in two volumes. Vol. ii. p. 113. 5th edition 1723.</note> and at his return publiſhed
a pompous account of it, firſt in Italian, then in Engliſh. He had
been in Italy before. At his return from the embaſſy he was morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to find that Sir Godfrey Kneller had engroſſed moſt of his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
In 1700, upon a vacancy of the king's painter in Scotland,
he ſollicited to ſucceed, but a ſhop-keeper was preferred—and in
truth Wright had not much pretenſions to favour in that reign—yet
as good as his fellow-labourer Tate, who wrote panegyrics in Wright's
edition of the embaſſy, and yet was made Poet Laureat to king Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam.

Orlandi mentions Wright; "Michaele <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. T. Pelham of Stanmore has a ſmall three-quarters of Mrs. Cleypole, on which is written M. Ritus. Fec. It is an emblematic piece, the allegory of which is very obſcure, but highly finiſhed. There is another exactly the ſame, except that it wants the painter's name, at Eaſt Horſley, formerly the ſeat of Sir Edward Nicholas.</note> Rita Ingleſe notato

left a ſon at Rome, who was maſter of languages and died there.
He had a nephew too of his own name, educated at Rome, but who
ſettled in Ireland, where he had ſo much ſucceſs, that he gained 900<hi>l.</hi>
the firſt year, and was always paid 10<hi>l.</hi> a head. Pooley and Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Smith were there at the ſame time; the latter and young Wright
were rivals.</p>
               <p>Wright the uncle had a fine collection of gems and coins, which
were purchaſed by Sir Hans Sloane after his death, which happened
about the year 1700, in James-ſtreet Covent-garden. He is buried

               <p>Scholar of Wright, was well deſcended, and painted both in oil and
crayons, in which he made great improvements for multiplying the
tints. He inſtructed Lutterel, who added the invention of uſing
crayons on copper plates. Vertue had ſeen a head of Sir John Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
afterwards lord Oſſulſton, painted neatly by Aſhfield, tho' not in
a good manner: but at Burleigh is a ſmall portrait of a lady Herbert
by him highly finiſhed and well painted.

               <p>GERARD SOEST, called ZOUST,</p>
               <p>Was born in Weſtphalia, and came to England probably before the
reſtoration, <note n="*" place="bottom">Printed in 1685. Deſcribing a picture of a huſband and wife, he ſays, "It muſt be valued an ornament to the dyning-room; being beſides well known to be the art of Sowſt's handy-work, and he a maſter of ſufficiencie. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phice p 43. At Welbeck is Lucy lady Hollis by him, 1657.</note> for Sanderſon mentions him as then of eſtabliſhed
reputation. By what I have ſeen of his hand, particularly his
own head at Houghton, he was an admirable maſter. It is animated
with truth and nature; round, bold, yet highly finiſhed. His dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries
were often of ſattin, in which he imitated the manner of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
a Dutch painter of converſations, but enlarged his ideas, on
ſeeing Vandyck. He was inliſted among the rivals of Sir Peter Lely;
the number of them is ſufficient honour to the latter. Emulation ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
unites a whole profeſſion againſt one, unleſs he is clearly their
ſuperior. Soeſt is commended by Vertue and Graham for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits
of men: Both confeſs that his taſte was too Dutch and ungrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and his humour too rough to pleaſe the ſofter ſex. The gentle
manners of Sir Peter carried them all from his competitor. Soeſt
who was capricious, ſlovenly and covetous, often went to the door
himſelf, and if he was not in a humour to draw thoſe who came to ſit,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0853300503:59"/>
or was employed in the meaner offices of his family, he would act the
ſervant and ſay his maſter was not at home: his dreſs made him eaſily
miſtaken. Once when he lived in Curſitor's-alley, he admitted two
ladies, but quitted the houſe himſelf.—His wife was obliged to ſay,
that ſince he could not pleaſe the ladies, he would draw no more of
them. Greenhill carried <note n="*" place="bottom">Of this perſon I find no other account.</note> Wildt the painter to Soeſt, who then lived
at the corner houſe in Holbourn-row, and he ſhowed them a man and
horſe large as life on which he was then at work, out of humour with
the public and the fairer half of it. In Jervaſe's ſale was a portrait
of Mr. John Norris by Soeſt, which Jervaſe eſteemed ſo much, that
he copied it more than once, and even imitated it in his firſt pictures.
On the back was written 1685, but that was a miſtake; Soeſt died
in Feb. 1681. I have a head by him, I believe of Griffiere; it has a
mantle of purple ſattin, admirably coloured. At the Royal Society is
a head of Dr. John Wallis; at Draper's-hall Sheldon Lord Mayor,
whole length; in the audit-room of Chriſt-church Oxford, a head of
Fuller biſhop of Lincoln; and at Wimpole was a good double half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>length
of John earl of Bridgwater and Grace, his counteſs, ſitting.
Vertue deſcribes another head of Sir Francis Throckmorton, in a full
wig and a cravat tied with a ribband, and the painter's name; a fine
head of Loggan the engraver; and another which he commends ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely

drapery: on the ſtraining frame was writ

               <p>Born at Dronthem in Norway, painted both hiſtory and portraits. He
was employed by Sir William Temple for three or four years, at his
houſe at Shene near Richmond where he died. All that Graham
knew remarkable relating to him, was that he was the firſt man bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

               <p>ADAM COLONI,</p>
               <p>Of Roterdam, lived many years in England, and was famous for ſmall

pictures of Baſſan, particularly thoſe in the royal collection. He died

               <p>His ſon Henry Adrian Coloni, was inſtructed by his father and by
his brother-in-law Vandieſt, and drew well. He ſometimes painted
in the landſcapes of the latter, and imitated Salvator Roſa. He was
buried near his father in 1701, at the age of 33.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFIERE,</p>
               <p>An agreable painter, called the gentleman of Utrecht, was born at
Amſterdam in 1645, and placed apprentice to a carpenter, a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
not at all ſuiting his inclination. He knew he did not like to be
a carpenter, but had not diſcovered his own bent. He quitted his
maſter, and was put to ſchool, but becoming acquainted with a lad
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0853300503:62"/>
who was learning to paint earthen-ware, young Griffiere was ſtruck
with the ſcience tho' in ſo rude a form, and paſſed his time in aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his friend inſtead of going to ſchool, yet returning regularly at
night as if he had been there. This deception however could not
long impoſe on his father, who prudently yielded to the force of the
boy's genius, but while he gratified it, hoped to ſecure him a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and bound him to the ſame maſter with his friend the tyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painter.
Griffiere improved ſo much even in that coarſe ſchool, that
he was placed with a painter of flowers, and then inſtructed by one
Roland Rogman, whoſe landſcapes were eſteemed. He received oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
leſſons too from Adrian Vandevelde, Ruiſdale, and Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brant,
whoſe peculiarity of ſtyle, and facility of glory, acquired rather
by a bold trick of extravagant chiaro ſcuro than by genius, captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the young painter, and tempted him to purſue that manner. But
Rogman diſſuaded him, and Griffiere tho' often indulging his taſte,
ſeems to have been fixed by his maſter to landſcapes, which he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with richneſs and neat colouring, and enlivened with ſmall figures,
cattle and buildings.</p>
               <p>When he quitted Rogman and Utrecht, he went to Roterdam, and
ſoon after the fire of London, came to England, married and ſettled
here; received ſome inſtructions from Loten, but eaſily excelled him.
He drew ſome views of London, Italian ruins and proſpects on the
Rhine. Such mixed ſcenes of rivers and rich country were his favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
ſubjects. He bought a yatch, embarked with his family and
his pencils, and paſſed his whole time on the Thames, between Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
Greenwich, Graveſend, &amp;c. Beſides theſe views, he excelled in
copying Italian and Flemiſh maſters, particularly Polenburgh, Teni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Hondecooter, Rembrandt and Ruyſdale.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0853300503:63"/>
After ſtaying here many years, he ſailed in his own yatch to Roter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
but being tempted by a pilot who was coming to England,
ſuddenly embarked again for this country, but was ſhipwrecked, and
loſt his whole cargo except a little gold which his daughter had wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in a leathern girdle. He remained in Holland ten or twelve years:
and returning to England, ſtruck upon a ſand-bank, where he was
eight days before he could get off. This new calamity cured him of
his paſſion for living on the water. He took a houſe in Millbank,
where he lived ſeveral years, and died in 1718, aged above 72. <note n="*" place="bottom">His pictures were ſold in Covent-garden after his death, with a collection by Italian and Flemiſh maſters, brought from Holland by his ſon Robert. Among the father's paintings were ſome in imitation of the different manners of Elſheim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Polenburg, Pouſſin, Wouverman, Berghem, Titian, Salvator Roſa, Gerard Dou, Baſſan, Guido, and Vanderwerffe. In the ſame catalogue is mentioned a piece in water-colours by Polenburg.</note> In
lord Orford's collection are two pretty pictures by him, a ſea-port
and a landſcape. He etched ſome ſmall plates of birds and beaſts
from drawings of Barlow, and five large half-ſheet plates of birds in
a ſet of twelve; the other ſeven were done by Fr. Place.</p>
               <p>Robert Griffiere, his ſon, born in England 1688, was bred under
his father, and made good progreſs in the art. He was in Ireland
when his father was ſhip-wrecked, and going to him in Holland, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
his manner of painting and that of Sachtleven. John Griffiere,
a good copyiſt of Claud Lorrain, and who died in Pall-mall a few
years ago, was, I believe, the younger ſon of old Griffiere.</p>
               <p>GERARD EDEMA,</p>
               <p>Born according to Vertue in Frieſland; Graham ſays at Amſterdam,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0853300503:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was ſcholar of Everding, whoſe manner he followed, and of whom
there is a ſmall book of mountainous proſpects, containing ſome 50
plates. Edema came to England about 1670, and made voyages
both to Norway and Newfoundland, to collect ſubjects for his pictures
among thoſe wildneſſes of nature; he delighting in rocky views,
falls of water, and ſcenes of horrour. For figures and buildings he
had no talent, and where he wanted them was aſſiſted by Wyck. The
latter, Vandevelde and Edema lived ſome time at Mount-Edgcumbe
with Sir Richard, grandfather of the preſent lord Edgcumbe, and
painted ſeveral views of the mount in concert, which are now in a
manner decayed. Edema's temper was not ſo unſociable as his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;
he loved the bottle, and died of it at Richmond about the year
1700; Graham ſays in the 40th year of his age, which probably is a
miſtake, if he came to England in 1670—he could not have learnt
much of Everding, if he quitted his ſchool at ten years old.</p>

               <p>Scholar of Aggas <note n="*" place="bottom">Aggas, whom I have mentioned in the firſt volume, p. 169, was little more than a ſcene-painter, for which reaſon I do not give him a ſeparate article here. All the account we have of him is from Graham.</note>, who painted landſcape in oil, figures and archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture
in diſtemper. The latter is only a dignified expreſſion, uſed

               <p>A French man, ſtudied under Le Brun, and afterwards in Italy the
Venetian ſchool. He came to England, and painted ſeveral pictures.
One for the famous Mrs. Stuart ducheſs of Richmond repreſented
Venus receiving armour from Vulcan for her ſon. The head-dreſs of
the goddeſs, her bracelets, and the Cupids had more the air of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles
than Latium. On the anvil was the painter's name, and the
date 1672. Notwithſtanding the good breeding of his pencil, Duval
was unſucceſsful, but Mr. Boyle finding in him ſome knowledge of
chymiſtry, in which he had hurt his ſmall fortune, generouſly allowed
him an annuity of 50<hi>l.</hi> On the death of his patron Duval fell into
great indigence, and at laſt became diſordered in his ſenſes. He was
buried at St. Martin's about 1709.</p>
               <p>EDWARD HAWKER,</p>
               <p>Succeeded Sir Peter Lely in his houſe, not in his reputation. He
painted a whole length of the duke of Grafton, from which there is a
print and a head of Sir Dudley North; was a poor knight of Windſor,
and was living in 1721, aged fourſcore. The reader muſt excuſe

ſhades, caught the roundneſs of his fleſh, but with a diſagreable livid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and poſſeſſed at leaſt as much grace and dignity. He came to
England, and was one of Charles's painters. In king James's cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
are mentioned twelve of his hand; moſt of them, I believe, are
ſtill in the royal palaces, four are at Windſor. At Chatſworth are
three by him; and Lot and his daughters at Coudray. His Hercules
and Deianira was ſold at Streater's ſale for 11 <hi>l.</hi> He was born in 1633,
and died in 1715. It is ſaid that he had a miſtreſs of whom he was
jealous, and whom he would not ſuffer the king to ſee.</p>
               <p>GASPAR NETSCHER <note n="*" place="bottom">he was diſciple of Terburg, who Deſcamps and the French author that I ſhall mention preſently, ſay, was in England; and the former adds that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived immenſe prices for his works, and that he twice drew king William III. However, his ſtay here was certainly ſhort, and as I cannot point out any of his works, it is not worth while to give him a ſeparate article. His life may be ſeen in the authors I quote. Teniers, who, according to the ſame writers, was here too, came only to buy pictures, and therefore belongs ſtill leſs to this catalogue.</note>,</p>
               <p>painted ſmall portraits in oil. He was invited to England by Sir

William Temple and recommended to the king, but <note n="*" place="bottom">The French author of the Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that he never was here, being apprehenſive of the tumult of a court, and that he compounded with the king by ſending him ſeveral pictures, p. 39. One would think that Charles had invited Netſcher to his parties of pleaſure, or to be a miniſter. The ſolitude of a painter's life is little diſturbed by working for a court. If the reſearches of Vertue were not more to be depended on than this inaccurate writer, the portraits of lord Berkeley and his lady would turn the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in his favour. Did Netſcher ſend them for preſents to the king? I don't mean in general to detract from the merits of this writer; he ſeems to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the profeſſion, and is particularly valuable for having collected ſo many portraits of artiſts, and for giving liſts of engravers after their pictures. His work conſiſts of three volumes quarto.</note> ſtaid not long
here. Vertue mentions five of his pictures: one, a lady and a dog,
with his name to it: another of a lady, her hands joined, oval on
copper: the third, lord Berkeley of Stratton, his lady, and a ſervant,
in one piece, dated 1676. The others, ſmall ovals on copper of king
William and queen Mary, painted juſt before the revolution, in the
collection of the duke of Portland. Netſcher died of the gravel and
gout in 1684.

huntings, proceſſions, &amp;c. and his brothers Roderigo and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
engraved them. If the pictures were equal to the plates from
them, which are extremely in the manner of Della Bella, Peter was
an artiſt of great merit. Graham ſays ſo, but that his reputation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
on the arrival of Wyck. Stoop was employed by one Doily, a
dealer in pictures, ſtuffs, &amp;c. and gave ſome inſtructions in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Johnſon that admirable old comedian, the moſt natural and of
the leaſt geſticulation I ever knew, ſo famous for playing the grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digger
in Hamlet, Moroſe, Noll Bluff, Biſhop Gardiner, and a few
other parts, and from whom Vertue received this account. Stoop
lived in Durham-yard, and when an aged man retired to Flanders
about 1678, where he died eight years afterwards. Vertue does not
ſay directly that the other two were brothers of Stoop; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
he confounds Roderigo with Peter, but I conclude they were his
brothers or ſons, from the prints etched by them about the very time
of Peter's arrival in England. They are a ſet of eight plates contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the public entry of admiral Sandwich into Liſbon, and all the

Theodore Stoop, ipſius regiae majeſtatis pictor, and is the only one to
which Vertue mentions the name of Theodore. The other in my

"Mr. William Vandevelde, ſenior, late painter of ſea-fights to
their majeſties king Charles II. and king James dyed 1693."</p>
               <p>William Vandevelde, the ſon, was the greateſt man that has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this branch of painting; the palm is not leſs diſputed with Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael
for hiſtory, than with Vandevelde for ſea-pieces: Annibal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racci
and Mr. Scott have not ſurpaſſed thoſe chieftains. William was
born at Amſterdam in 1633, and wanted no maſter but his father, till
the latter came to England; then for a ſhort time he was placed with
Simon de Vlieger, an admired ſhip-painter of that time, but whoſe
name is only preſerved now by being united to his diſciple's. Young
William was ſoon demanded by his father, and graciouſly entertained
by the king, to whoſe particular inclination his genius was adapted.
William, I ſuppoſe, lived chiefly with his father at Greenwich, who
had choſen that reſidence as ſuited to the ſubjects he wanted. In
king James's collection were eighteen pieces of the father and ſon;
ſeveral are at Hampton-court and at Hinchinbrook. At Buckingham-houſe
was a view of <note n="*" place="bottom">Vandevelde, by order of the Duke of York, attended the engagement in a ſmall veſſel.</note> Solebay-fight by the former, with a long inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But the beſt choſen collection of theſe maſters is in a chamber
at Mr. Skinner's in Clifford-ſtreet Burlington-gardens, aſſembled at
great prices by the late Mr. Walker. Vandevelde the ſon having
painted the junction of Engliſh and French fleets at the Nore, whither
king Charles went to view them, and where he was repreſented going
on board his own yatch, two commiſſioners of the Admiralty agreed
to beg it of the king, to cut it in two, and each to take a part. The
painter, in whoſe preſence they concluded this wiſe treaty, took away
the picture and concealed it, till the king's death, when he offered it to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0853300503:74"/>
Bullfinch, the printſeller (from whom Vertue had the ſtory) for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
pounds. Bullfinch took time to conſider, and returning to the
purchaſe, found the picture ſold for 130 guineas. Afterwards it was
in the poſſeſſion of Mr. Stone, a merchant retired into Oxfordſhire.</p>
               <p>William the younger died in 1707, as appears by this inſcription

               <p>William the elder had a brother named Cornelius <note n="*" place="bottom">The anonymous author of the Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres, mentions three other Vandeveldes; Adrian who, he ignorantly ſays, was <hi>le plus connu,</hi> was no relation of the others, and John an engraver, and Iſaiah, a battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painter, both brothers of the firſt William, as well as this Cornelius, p. 102.</note>, who like him

               <p>The younger William left a ſon, a painter too of the ſame ſtyle, and
who made good copies from his father's works, but was otherwiſe no
conſiderable performer. He went to Holland and died there. He

by two views of Windſor, ſtill in the gallery there. After the rapid
conqueſts of the French in 1672 he removed from Utrecht to Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,
and pleaſing the marquis de Bethune, was made his major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domo,
employed to purchaſe pictures, and carried by him to France,
from whence he paſſed into England, and painted for king Charles a
chimney-piece at Whitehall, and a few other things <note n="*" place="bottom">He painted a view of Sterling-caſtle, the figures by Wyck, from whence we may conclude that they took a journey to Scotland.</note>; but demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

many commiſſions from court; and being as vain in his expence as

to the king for delivery: his countrymen freed him by a contribution.
Sir William Soames being ſent embaſſador to Conſtantinople by
James II. Voſterman accompanied him, intending to paint the delights
of that ſituation; but Sir William dying on the road, it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

               <p>WILLIAM WISSING,</p>
               <p>Was born at Amſterdam and bred under Dodaens an hiſtoric painter
of the Hague, from whence Wiſſing paſſed into France, contracted
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0853300503:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the furbelowed ſtyle of that country and age, and came into England,
where at leaſt he learned it in it's perfection from Sir Peter Lely for
whom he worked, and after whoſe death he grew into faſhion. He
drew all the royal family, and particularly the duke of Monmouth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times, which ingratiated him with the king and the ladies. Sir
Godfrey Kneller, then the riſing genius, was a formidable rival, but
death put an end to the conteſt in the thirty-firſt year of Wiſſing's age,
who deceaſed at Burleigh, the lord Exeter's, in 1687. He was buried
at the expence of that earl in St. Martin's Stamford, where againſt a
pillar in the middle iſle of the church, is a monumental table to his
memory; the inſcription may be ſeen in Graham. There are ſeveral
prints from his works, particularly one of queen Catherine with a dog.

               <p>ADRIAN HENNY or HENNIN,</p>
               <p>One of the laſt painters who arrived in the reign of Charles II. little
is known of him, but that having been two years in France, he adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the manner of Gaſpar Pouſſin. Vertue thought he came in 1680;
if ſo, the title-plate to a hiſtory of Oxford deſigned by him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved
by White in 1674, muſt have been done antecedent to his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0853300503:78"/>
He painted much at Eythorp, the ſeat of Dormer lord Carnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von,
now of Sir William Stanhope, and died here in 1710.</p>
               <p>HERBERT TUER</p>
               <p>Was ſecond ſon of Theophilus Tuer, by Catherine, neice of Mr.
George Herbert the poet: his grandfather and great-grandfather
were vicars, the former of Elſenham in Eſſex, the latter of Sabridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
in Hertfordſhire, towards the latter end of Elizabeth. Herbert,
who received his name from his maternal uncle, withdrew with his
youngeſt brother Theophilus, into Holland, after the death of Charles
1ſt. The latter followed arms; Herbert applied to painting, and
made good progreſs in portraits, as appears by ſome ſmall ones of
himſelf and family, now in England, where however they are little
known. A print of Sir Lionel Jenkins, probably drawn at Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,
is from a picture by Tuer. He married two wives, Mary Van
Gameren, daughter of a procurer of Utrecht, and Elizabeth Van Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menbergh.
John, his ſon by the firſt, was reſident at Nimeguen with
his mother-in-law in 1680, at which time Herbert was dead. It is
believed that he died at Utrecht, where in the Painter's-hall is ſaid to
be a head finely coloured by him.</p>
               <p>TEMPESTA and TOMASO,</p>
               <p>Two painters who worked at Wilton, painting cielings and pannels
of rooms. Tempeſta was I believe, ſon of a well-known painter of
the ſame name. Tomaſo, and a brother of his, who was employed at
Wilton too, were brought over by Sir Charles Cotterel, for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0853300503:79"/>
I have placed them here, tho' I do not know exactly whether their
performances were not dated a little later than this period. I find no
other mention of them <note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Delawar has a picture of Apollo and the Muſes, evidently a copy of Rubens; in one corner is the painter's name, J. Tomaſo.</note> or Tempeſta in England. There are at Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
two pieces of tapeſtry after the Cartoons of Raphael, with the
workman's name Stephen Mayn, and his arms, a croſs of St. George;
probably executed long before this period, and perhaps not in England.</p>
               <p>If our painters in oil were not of the firſt rate during the period I

               <p>SAMUEL COOPER,</p>
               <p>Owed great part of his merit to the works of Vandyck, and yet may
be called an original genius, as he was the firſt who gave the ſtrength
and freedom of oil to miniature. Oliver's works are touched and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched
with ſuch careful fidelity that you cannot help perceiving they
are nature in the abſtract; Cooper's are ſo bold that they ſeem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
nature only of a leſs ſtandard. Magnify the former, they are ſtill
diminutively conceived: if a glaſs could expand Cooper's pictures to
the ſize of Vandyck's, they would appear to have been painted for that
proportion. If his portrait of <note n="†" place="bottom">This fine head is in the poſſeſſion of the lady Frankland, widow of Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,

piece, cardinal Bentivoglio: The quick fineſſe of eye in a florid Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
writer was not a ſubject equal to the protector; but it would be
an amuſing trial to balance Cooper's Oliver and Vandyck's lord Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.
To trace the lineaments of equal ambition, equal intrepidity,
equal art, equal preſumption, and to compare the ſkill of the maſters
in repreſenting the one exalted to the height of his hopes, yet perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a command he could ſcarce hold, did not dare to relinquiſh,
and yet dared to exert; the other, daſhed in his career, willing to
avoid the precipice, ſearching all the receſſes of ſo great a ſoul, to
break his fall, and yet ready to mount the ſcaffold with more dignity
than the other aſcended the throne. This parallel is not a picture
drawn by fancy; if the artiſts had worked in competition, they could
not have approached nigher to the points of view in which I have
traced the characters of their heroes.</p>
               <p>Cooper with ſo much merit had two defects. His ſkill was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a meer head; his drawing even of the neck and ſhoulders ſo
incorrect and untoward, that it ſeems to account for the numbers of
his works unfiniſhed. It looks as if he was ſenſible how ſmall a way
his talent extended. This very poverty accounts for the other, his
want of grace: A ſignal deficience in a painter of portraits—yet how
ſeldom poſſeſſed! Bounded as their province is to a few tame atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
how grace attones for want of action! Cooper, content, like
his countrymen, with the good ſenſe of truth, neglected to make
truth engaging. Grace in painting ſeems peculiar to Italy. The
Flemings and the French run into oppoſite extremes. The firſt
never approach the line, the latter exceed it, and catch at moſt but a
leſſer ſpecies of it, the genteel, which if I were to define, I ſhould call
familiar grace, as grace ſeems an amiable degree of majeſty. Cooper's
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0853300503:82"/>
women, like his model Vandyck's, are ſeldom very handſome. It is
Lely alone that excuſes the galantries of Charles II. He painted an
apology for that Aſiatic court.</p>
               <p>The anecdotes of Cooper's life are few; nor does it ſignify; his
works are his hiſtory. He was born in 1609 and inſtructed, with his
brother Alexander, by their uncle Hoſkins, who, ſays Graham, was
jealous of him, and whom he ſoon ſurpaſſed. The variety of tints that
he introduced, the clearneſs of his carnations, and looſe management
of hair exceed his uncle, though in the laſt Hoſkins had great merit
too. The author I have juſt quoted mentions another capital work of
Cooper, the portrait of one Swingfield, which recommended the artiſt
to the court of France, where he painted ſeveral pieces larger than his
uſual ſize, and for which his widow received a penſion during her life.
He lived long in France, and Holland, and dying in London May 5, <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Willett in Thames-ſtreet has a head of a young man in armour, of the family of Deane in Suffolk, not equal to moſt of Cooper's works. My reaſon for mentioning it, is, it's being ſet in an enamelled caſe, on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of which are two beautifull Madonnas, each with the child, freely painted, in a light ſtyle: within, is likewiſe an enamelled landſcape. The picture is dated 1649. This, collated with my enamel of general Fairfax, ſeems to corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate my opinion that Bordier (by whom I take theſe enamels to be painted) remained here after Petitot left England.</note>
1672 at the age of 63 was buried in Pancras-church, where is a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for him. The inſcription is in Graham, who adds that he had
great ſkill in muſic, and played well on the lute.</p>
               <p>His works are too many to be enumerated, ſeven or eight are in
queen Caroline's cloſet at Kenſington; one of them, a head of
Moncke, is capital; but unfiniſhed. Lord Oxford had a head of

his monument by Ryſbrach was taken from a picture of Cooper.</p>
               <p>It is an anecdote little known, I believe, and too trifling but for
ſuch a work as this, that Pope's mother was ſiſter of Cooper's wife.
Lord Carleton had a portrait of Cooper in crayons, which Mrs. Pope
ſaid was not very like, and which, deſcending to lord Burlington, was
given by his lordſhip to Kent. It was painted by one Jackſon, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Cooper, of whom I know nothing more, and who, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
drew another head of Cooper, in crayons, in queen Caroline's
cloſet, ſaid to be painted by himſelf; but I find no account of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays
in that way. He did once attempt oil, as Murray the painter
told Vertue, and added, that Hayles thereupon applied to miniature,
which he threatened to continue, unleſs Cooper deſiſted from oil;
which he did—but ſuch menaces do not frighten much, unleſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by want of ſucceſs. Among Orinda's poems is one to Cooper
on drawing her friend Lucaſia's picture, in 1660.</p>
               <p>RICHARD GIBSON,</p>
               <p>The Dwarf, being page to a lady at Mortlack, was placed by her
with Franceſco Cleyne, to learn to draw, in which he ſucceeded, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
himſelf by copying the works of Sir Peter Lely, who drew
Gibſon's picture leaning on a buſt, 1658, another evidence of Sir
Peter being here before the reſtoration. It was in the poſſeſſion of

never received it. Her <note n="*" place="bottom">See notes to Fenton's Waller.</note> name was Anne Shepherd. The little
pair were each three feet ten inches high. Waller has celebrated
their nuptials in one of his prettieſt poems. The huſband was page
to the king, and had already attained ſuch excellence, that a picture
of the man and loſt ſheep painted by him, and much admired by the
king, was the cauſe of Vanderdort's death, as we have ſeen in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
volume. Thomas <note n="†" place="bottom">Gibſon had been patronized by Philip earl of Pembroke, and painted Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's picture ſeveral times.

dwarfs hand in hand by Sir Peter Lely, and exchanging it for another
picture, it fell into the poſſeſſion of Cock the auctioneer, who ſold it

Vandyck. Mr. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. W. Hamilton, Envoy to Naples, has a drawing of Gibſon by Vandyck.</note> Roſe had another ſmall piece of the dwarf and his

Gibſon taught queen Anne to draw, and went to Holland to inſtruct
her ſiſter the princeſs of Orange. The ſmall couple had nine chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

portraits in oil, but changed that manner for crayons. His own pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
done by himſelf in this way 1690, was at Tart-hall. Edward
died at the age of 33.</p>
               <p>JOHN DIXON</p>
               <p>Scholar of Sir Peter Lely, painted both in miniature and crayons, but
moſtly the former. In the latter was his own head. In water-colours
there are great numbers of his works; above ſixty were in lord
Oxford's collection, both portraits and hiſtories, particularly, Diana
and her Nymphs bathing, after Polenburg, and a ſleeping Venus,
Cupids, and a Satyr. Theſe were his beſt works. He was keeper
of the king's picture-cloſet; and in 1698 was concerned in a bubble
Lottery. The whole ſum was to be 40,000<hi>l.</hi> divided into 1214
prizes, the higheſt prize in money 3000<hi>l.</hi> the loweſt 20<hi>l.</hi> One prize,
a collection of limnings, he valued ſo highly, that the perſon
to whom it ſhould fall, might, in lieu of it, receive 2000<hi>l.</hi> each
ticket twenty ſhillings. Queen Anne, then princeſs, was an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer.
This affair turned out ill, and Dixon, falling into debt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
for ſecurity from St. Martin's-lane, where he lived, to the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0853300503:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King's-bench-walks in the Temple, and latterly to a ſmall eſtate he
had at Thwaite near Bungay in Suffolk, where he died about 1715;
and where his widow and children were living in 1725. Dixon, adds
Vertue, once bought a picture for a trifle at a broker's, which he ſold
to the duke of Devonſhire for 500<hi>l.</hi> but does not ſpecify the hand
or ſubject.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER MARSHAL</p>
               <p>Another performer in water-colonrs, who painted on velom a book of
Mr. Tradeſcant's <note n="*" place="bottom">V. Muſeum Tradeſcantianum. It is a ſmall book containing a catalogue of the rarities in that collection at Lambeth, with two prints by Hollar of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſon.</note> choiceſt flowers and plants. At Dr. Friend's Vertue
ſaw ſeveral pretty large pieces after Vandyck, the fleſh painted very
carefully. He mentions too one Joſhua Marſhall, a ſculptor, who in
1664, executed the monument of Baptiſt lord Noel and his lady in
Glouceſterſhire.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HASSEL</p>
               <p>Another painter known only to the induſtry of Mr. Vertue, who ſaw
an oval miniature of a Scotch gentleman, which being engraved by
P. Vanderbank was falſely inſcribed <hi>lord Marr.</hi> The mark on the
picture was W. H. 1685. This, ſays Vertue, I think, was William
Haſſel. Since the firſt edition I am informed that Mr. Haſſel not
only painted in miniature but in oil, in which way he executed an oval
head of Mr. Hughes, author of the ſeige of Damaſcus, who joined
the ſiſter arts, and painted ſeveral ſmall pieces in water-colours for his

from whom I received theſe notices has a buſt of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Mr. Hughes done by her in Indian ink. There lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ſame time one Conſtantine, a landſcape-painter, and Mr.
White, a limner: Mr. Hughes addreſſed a poem to the former.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW SNELLING</p>
               <p>A gentleman who painted in miniature, and that (being very galant)
ſeldom but for ladies. In Mr. Roſe's ſale 1723 was a head of Snel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by Cooper 1644, finely painted, but the hands and drapery poor.
Mr. Beal mentious him in one of his pocket-books <note n="*" place="bottom">See the next article.</note>, for ſending pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
of colours to his wife in 1654, and 1658; and that in 1678,
Mr. Snelling offered him thirty guineas for a Venus and Cupid after
Rottenhamer, for which he aſked forty guineas and was worth fifty. I
do not know whether this perſon was related to Thomas Snelling, a
poet recorded in Wood's Athenae, vol. ii. p. 135.</p>
               <p>MARY BEALE</p>
               <p>Was daughter of Mr. Cradock, miniſter of Walton <note n="†" place="bottom">Where Mr. Beale afterwards erected a monument for him.</note> upon Thames,
and learned the rudiments of painting from Sir Peter Lely, and had
ſome inſtructions, as Vertue thought, from Walker. She painted in
oil, water-colours and crayons, and had much buſineſs; her portraits
were in the Italian ſtyle which ſhe acquired by copying ſeveral pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and drawings from Sir Peter Lely's and the royal collections.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0853300503:90"/>
Her maſter was ſuppoſed to have had a tender attachment to her,
but as he was reſerved in communicating to her all the reſources of
his pencil, it probably was a galant paſſion, rather than a ſucceſsful
one. Dr. Woodfall wrote ſeveral poems to her honour, under the
name of Beleſia; but the fulleſt hiſtory of her life and works was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
by her own huſband, who in ſmall almanac-pocket-books
minuted down almoſt daily accounts of whatever related to himſelf,
his buſineſs, and his wife's pictures. Of theſe almanacs there were
above thirty, which with moſt of Mr. Beale's papers came into the
hands of Carter, colourman, to whom Beale bequeathed them. Some
were ſold to Mr. Brooke a clergyman. His ſhare Carter lent to a
low painter, whoſe goods being ſeized the pocket-books were loſt, but
ſeven of them a friend of Vertue's met with on a ſtall, bought, and
lent to him. Moſt of his extracts I ſhall now offer to the reader,
without apprehenſion of their being condemned as trifling or tireſome.
If they are ſo, how will this whole work eſcape? When one writes
the lives of artiſts, who in general were not very eminent, their
pocket-books are as important as any part of their hiſtory—I ſhall
uſe no farther apology—if even thoſe that are loſt ſhould be
regretted!</p>
               <p>"The firſt is 1672. 20 April. Mr. Lely was here with Mr. Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Mr. Skipwith, to ſee us, and commended very much her
(Mrs. Beale's) coppy after our Saviour praying in the garden, &amp;c.
after Anto. da Correggio: her coppy in little after Endimion Porter
his lady and three ſons he commended extraordinarily, and ſaid (to
uſe his own words) it was painted like Vandyke himſelf in little, and
that it was the beſt coppy he ever ſaw of Vandyke. Alſo he very
well liked her two coppyes in great of Mr. Porter's little ſon Phil. He
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0853300503:91"/>
commended her other works, coppyes and thoſe from the life. Both
he and Mr. Gibſon both commended her works.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lely told me at the ſame time as he was moſt ſtudiouſly
looking at my biſhop's picture of Vandyke's, and I chanced to aſk him
how Sir Antony cou'd poſſibly diviſe to finiſh in one day a face that
was ſo exceeding full of work, and wrought up to ſo extraordinary a
perfection—I believe, ſaid he, he painted it over fourteen times.
And upon that he took occaſion to ſpeake of Mr. Nicholas Laniere's
picture of Sr. Anto. V. D. doing, which, ſaid he, Mr. Laniere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
told me he ſatt ſeaven entire dayes for it to Sr. Anto. and that he
painted upon it of all thoſe ſeaven dayes both morning and afternoon,
and only intermitted the time they were at dinner. And he ſaid like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that tho' Mr. Laniere ſatt ſo often and ſo long for his picture,
that he was not permitted ſo much as once to ſee it, till he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
finiſhed the face to his own ſatisfaction. This was the picture
which being ſhow'd to king Charles the firſt cauſed him to give order
that V. Dyck ſhou'd be ſent for over into England.</p>

had 6000<hi>l.</hi> and ſeveral children, among whom was the well-known
laureat, born in 1671 at his father's houſe in Southampton-ſtreet
facing Southampton-houſe. Gabriel Cibber the ſtatuary was carver
to the king's cloſet and died about 1700 at the age of 70. His ſon
had a portrait of him by old Laroon, with a medal in his hand. I
have one in water-colours with a pair of compaſſes, by Chriſtian
Richter; probably a copy from the former, with a ſlight variation.
What is wanting in circumſtances, is more than compenſated by his
works. The moſt capital are the two figures of melancholy and
raving madneſs before the front of Bedlam. The baſreliefs <note n="†" place="bottom">A deſcription of them may be ſeen in the new account of London and the environs. Vol. v. p. 3.</note> on two
ſides of the monument are by his hand too. So are the fountain in
Soho-ſquare and one of the fine vaſes at Hampton-court, ſaid to be
done in competition with a foreigner who executed the other, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
has told us which is Cibber's. He carved moſt of the ſtatues of
kings round the Royal-exchange, as far as king Charles, and that of
Sir Thomas Greſham in the piazza beneath. The firſt duke of Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire
employed him much at Chatſworth; where two ſphinxes on large
baſes, well executed and with ornaments in good taſte are of his work,
and till very lately there was a ſtatue of Neptune in a fountain, ſtill
better. He carved there ſeveral door-caſes of alabaſter with rich fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liage,
and many ornaments in the chapel; and on each ſide of the
altar is a ſtatue by him, Faith and Hope; the draperies have great
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0853300503:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
merit, but the airs of the heads are not ſo good as that of the Neptune.
Cibber built the Daniſh church in London and was buried there him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
with his ſecond wife, for whom a monument was erected in 1696.
The ſon will be known as long as the Careleſs Huſband and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires
of his own Life exiſt, and ſo long the injuſtice of calling the
figures at Bedlam<q>—his brazen brainleſs brothers,</q>and the peeviſh weakneſs of thruſting him into the Dunciad in the

               <p>FRANCIS DU SART</p>
               <p>Of Hanau, is mentioned in De Bie's Golden Cabinet, who ſays, he
was employed by the king of England to adorn his palace with works
in marble and models in clay, and that he died in London 1661. It
is uncertain whether this <hi>king</hi> was Charles the firſt, or whether Du

become great poets or great painters becauſe their talents have capital
models before their eyes. An inventor is equally a maſter, whether
born in Italy or Lapland. There is no inſtance of a man before
Gibbons who gave to wood the looſe and airy lightneſs of flowers, and

chained together the various productions of the elements with a free
diſorder natural to each ſpecies: Vertue had received two different
accounts of his birth; from Murray the painter, that he was born in
Holland of Engliſh parents, and came over at the age of nineteen;
from Stoakes (relation of the Stones) that his father was a Dutchman,
but that Gibbons himſelf was born in Spur-alley in the Strand.
This is circumſtantial, and yet the former teſtimony ſeems moſt true,
as Gibbons is an Engliſh name, and Grinling probably Dutch. He
afterwards lived, added Stoakes, in Belſavage-court on Ludgate-hill,
where he carved a pot of flowers which ſhook ſurprizingly with the
motion of the coaches that paſſed by. It is certain that he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by Betterton on the decorations of the Theatre in Dorſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden,
where he carved the capitals, cornices and eagles. He lived
afterwards at Deptford, in the ſame houſe with a muſician, where the
beneficent and curious Mr. Evelyn found and patronized them both.
This gentleman, Sir Peter Lely, and Bap. May, who was ſomething
of an architect himſelf, recommended Gibbons to Charles II. who
though too indolent to ſearch for genius, and too indiſcriminate in his
bounty to confine it to merit, was always pleaſed, when it was
brought home to him. He gave the artiſt a place in the board of
works, and employed his hand on the ornaments of moſt taſte in his
palaces, particularly at Windſor, where in the chapel the ſimplicity of
the carver's foliage at once ſets off and atones for the glare of Verrio's
paintings. Gibbons in gratitude made a preſent of his own buſt in
wood to Mr. Evelyn who kept it at his houſe in Dover-ſtreet. The
piece that had ſtruck ſo good a judge was a large carving in wood of
St. Stephen ſtoned, long preſerved in the ſculptor's own houſe, and
afterwards purchaſed and placed by the duke of Chandos at Cannons.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0853300503:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
At Windſor too, Gibbons, whoſe art penetrated all materials, carved
that beautiful pedeſtal in marble for the equeſtrian <note n="*" place="bottom">Under the ſtatue is an engine for raiſing water contrived by Sir Samuel Morland alias Morley; he was ſon of Sir Samuel Morland of Sulhamſted Bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the county of Berkſhire, created a baronet by Charles II. in conſideration of ſervices performed during the king's exile. The ſon was a great mechanic; and was preſented with a gold medal, and made Magiſter Mechanicorum by the king in 1681. He invented the drum-capſtands for weighing heavy anchors; and the ſpeaking trumpet, and other uſeful engines. He died and was buried at Hammerſmith in Middleſex 1696. There is a monument for the two wives of Sir Samuel Morland in Weſtminſter-abbey. His arms were ſable a leopard's head jeſſant a fleur de lys, or. There is a print of the ſon by Lombart after Lely. This Sir Samuel built a large room in his garden at Vaux-hall, which was much admired at that time; on the top was a punchinello holding a dial.

it, of his hand. There is great eaſe in the attitude, and a claſſic ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.

for a ſtatue of James II. the price 300<hi>l.</hi> half to be paid down on ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I am the rather inclined to attribute the ſtatue at Whitehall to Gibbons, becauſe I know no other artiſt of that time capable of it.</note>.</p>
               <p>Gibbons made a magnificent tomb for Baptiſt Noel Viſcount
Camden, in the church of Exton in Rutlandſhire; it coſt 1000<hi>l.</hi> is
22 feet high, and 14 wide. There are two figures of him, and his
lady, and baſreliefs of their children. The ſame workman performed
the wooden throne at Canterbury, which coſt 70 <hi>l.</hi> and was the dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of archbiſhop Teniſon. The foliage in the Choir of St. Paul's is
of his hand. At Burleigh is a noble profuſion of his carving, in pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-frames,
chimney-pieces, and door-caſes, and the laſt Supper in
alto relievo, finely executed. At Chatſworth, where a like taſte col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
ornaments by the moſt eminent living maſters, are many by Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons,
particularly in the chapel; in the great anti-chamber are ſeveral
dead fowl over the chimney, finely executed, and over a cloſet door,
a pen not diſtinguiſhable from real feather. When Gibbons had
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0853300503:110"/>
finiſhed his works in that palace, he preſented the duke with a point
cravat, a woodcock, and a medal with his own head, all preſerved in
a glaſs-caſe in the gallery. I have another point cravat by him, the
art of which arrives even to deception, and Herodias with St. John's
head, alto relievo in ivory. In Thoreſby's collection was Elijah under
the juniper-tree ſupported by an Angel, ſix inches long and four wide. <note n="*" place="bottom">Ducatus Leodienſis, p. 488.</note>
At Houghton two chimneys are adorned with his foliage. At Mr.
Norton's at Southwick in Hampſhire was a whole gallery embroider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in pannels by his hand—but the moſt ſuperb monument of his
ſkill is a large chamber at Petworth enriched from the cieling, between
the pictures, with feſtoons of flowers and dead game, &amp;c. all in the
higheſt perfection and preſervation. Appendant to one is an antique
vaſe with a baſrelief, of the pureſt taſte, and worthy the Grecian age
of Cameos. Selden, one of his diſciples and aſſiſtants—for what one
hand could execute ſuch plenty of laborious productions? loſt his life
in ſaving this carving when the ſeat was on fire. The font in St.
James's-church was the work of Gibbons.</p>
               <p>If theſe encomiums <note n="†" place="bottom">Tate wrote a poem on the ſight of a buſt in marble of Gibbons.</note> are exaggerated, the works are extant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
me. Let us now ſee how well qualified a man, who vaunts
his having been in England, was, to ſpeak of Gibbons. It is the
author of the Abregè whom I have frequently mentioned. "Les
Anglois, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vol. ii. p. 216.</note> ſays he, n'ont eu qu'un bon ſculpteur, nommè Gibbons,
mais il n'etoit pas excellent. La figure de marbre de Charles II. pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cêe
au milieu de la bourſe à Londres eſt de ſa main." What would
this author have ſaid of him, if he had waſted his art on ribbands
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0853300503:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sand ringlets flowing in one blended ſtream from the laurel of Louis
XIV. to the tip of his horſe's tail <note n="*" place="bottom">This is litterally the caſe in the equeſtrian ſtatue at Lyons.</note>?</p>
               <p>Gibbons died Aug. 3d, 1721, at his houſe in Bow-ſtreet, Covent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden,
and in November of the following year, his collection, a very
conſiderable one, of pictures, models, &amp;c. was ſold by auction.
Among other things, were two chimney-pieces of his own work, the
one valued at 100<hi>l.</hi> the other at 120; his own buſt in marble, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
but the wig and cravat extravagant; and an original of Simon
the engraver by Sir Peter Lely, which had been much damaged by
the fall of Gibbons's houſe.</p>
               <p>There are two different prints of Gibbons by Smith, both fine;
the one with his wife, after Cloſterman; the other from a picture at
Houghton by Sir Godfrey Kneller, who has ſhown himſelf as great
in that portrait as the man was who ſat to him.</p>
               <p>Gibbons had ſeveral diſciples and workmen; Selden I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
Watſon aſſiſted chiefly at Chatſworth, where the boys and
many of the ornaments in the chapel were executed by him. Dievot
of Bruſſels, and Laurens of Mechlin were principal journeymen—
Vertue ſays they modelled and caſt the ſtatue I have mentioned in the
Privy-garden, which confirms my conjecture of it's being the figure
intended in the agreement. If either of them <hi>modelled</hi> it, and not
Gibbons himſelf, the true artiſt deſerves to be known. They both
retired to their own country on the Revolution; Laurens performed
much both in ſtatuary and in wood, and grew rich. Dievot lived till
1715 and died at Mechlin.

Wren even as an architect. Every circumſtance of his ſtory has been
written and repeated. Biſhop Sprat, Antony Wood, Ward in his
lives of the Greſham Profeſſors, the General Dictionary, and the New
Deſcription of London and the Environs, both in the hands of every
body, are voluminous on the article of Sir Chriſtopher: above all a
deſcendent of his own has given us a folio, called Parentalia, which
leaves nothing to be deſired on this ſubject. Yet in a work of ſuch a
nature as this, men would be diſappointed, ſhould they turn to it, and
receive no ſatisfaction. They muſt be gratified, though my province
becomes little more than that of a meer tranſcriber.</p>
               <p>Sir Chriſtopher Wren, of an ancient family in the Biſhoprick of
Durham, was ſon of a dean of Windſor, and nephew of Matthew,
biſhop, ſucceſſively, of Hereford, Norwich, Ely. He was born at
London in 1632, and educated at Oxford. His mathematical abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
unfolded themſelves ſo early, that by twenty he was elected pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
of aſtronomy at Greſham-college, and eight years afterwards
Savilian profeſſor of aſtronomy at Oxford. His diſcoveries in philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
mechanics, &amp;c. contributed to the reputation of the new
eſtabliſhed Royal-ſociety, and his ſkill in architecture had raiſed his
own name ſo high, that in the firſt year of the Reſtoration he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
coadjutor to Sir John Denham ſurveyor of the works, whom
he ſucceeded in 1668. Three years before that he had viſited France—
and unfortunately went no farther—the great number of drawings
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0853300503:117"/>
he made there from their buildings, had but too viſible influence on
ſome of his own—but it was ſo far lucky for Sir Chriſtopher, that
Louis XIV. had erected palaces only, no churches. St. Paul's eſcaped,
but <note n="*" place="bottom">I have been aſſured by a deſcendent of Sir Chriſtopher, that he gave another deſign for Hampton-court in a better taſte, which queen Mary wiſhed to have had executed, but was over-ruled.</note> Hampton-court was ſacrificed to the god of falſe taſte. In 1680
he was choſen preſident of the Royal-ſociety; was in two parliaments,
was twice married, had two ſons and a daughter, and died <note n="†" place="bottom">Elkanah Settle publiſhed a funeral poem on him, called Threnodia Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris; there is another in Latin in the Parentalia.</note> in 1723,

Paul's; a fabric, and an event, which one cannot wonder left ſuch an
impreſſion of content on the mind of the good old man, that being
carried to ſee it once a year, it ſeemed to recall a memory that was
almoſt deadened to every other uſe. He was buried under his own
fabric, with four words that comprehend his merit and his fame; ſi

He drew a view of Windſor, which was engraved by Hollar;

Vertue thinks they were engraved by Loggan. He found out a
ſpeedy was of etching, and was the inventor of drawing pictures by
miſcroſcopic glaſſes; and he ſays himſelf, that he invented ſerpentine-rivers.

is the beſt excuſe for another fault, the union of Grecian and Gothic.
The Ionic Colonade that croſſes the inner quadrangle of Hampton-court
is a glaring blemiſh by it's want of harmony with the reſt of
Wolſey's fabric. Kent was on the point of repeating this incongruity
in the ſame place in the late reign, but was over-ruled by my father.</p>

never ſaw a beautiful modern ſteeple. They are of Gothic origine,
and have frequently great merit either in the ſolid dignity of towers,
or in the airy form of taper ſpires. When broken into unmeaning
parts, as thoſe erected in later times are, they are a pile of barbarous
uglineſs, and deform the temples to which they are coupled. Sir
Chriſtopher has ſhown how ſenſible he was of this abſurdity impoſed

finiſhed in a year. The impropriety of the ſituation and the haſte of
the execution are ſome excuſe for the architect—but Sir Chriſtopher
was not happy in all kind of buildings. He had great abilities rather
than taſte. When he has ſhewed the latter, it was indeed to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
The circular porticos and other parts of St. Paul's are truly
gracefull; and ſo many great architects as were employed on St.
Peter's have not left it upon the whole a more perfect edifice than
this work of a ſingle mind. The gawdineſs of the Romiſh religion
has given St. Peter's one of it's chief advantages. The exceſs of
plainneſs in our cathedral diſappoints the ſpectator after ſo rich an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
The late prince of Wales, I have heard, intended to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
tombs into it, and to begin with that of his grandfather. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that Weſtminſter-abbey is overſtocked, and that the moſt
venerable monuments of antiquity are daily removed there to make
room for modern (a precedent that one ſhould think would diſcourage
even the moderns from dealing with the chapter) St. Paul's would
afford a new theatre for ſtatuaries to exert their genius—and the
Abbey would ſtill preſerve it's general cuſtomers, by new recruits of
waxen puppets. The towers of the laſt mentioned fabric, and the
propoſed ſpire were deſigned by Sir Chriſtopher.</p>
               <p>The Monument. The architect's intention was to erect the ſtatue
of Charles II. on the ſummit, inſtead of that ſilly pot of flames; but
was over-ruled, as he often was by very inferior judgments.</p>
               <p>The Theatre in Drury-lane; and the old Theatre in Saliſbury-court.
The reſt of his churches, publications, deſigns, &amp;c. may be
ſeen at large in the Parentalia. Among the latter was the mauſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum
of Charles I. It was curious piety in Charles II. to erect a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument

father!</p>
               <p>Many drawings by Sir Chriſtopher, particularly for St. Paul's,
were ſold in his ſon's auction a few years ago.</p>
               <p>The medalliſts in this reign lie in a narrow compaſs, but were not
the worſt Artiſts.</p>
               <p>The ROTIERS</p>
               <p>Were a family of medalliſts. The father, a goldſmith and banker,
aſſiſted Charles II. with money during his exile, in return for which
the king promiſed, if he was reſtored, to employ his ſons, who were
all gravers of ſeals and coins. The Reſtoration happened; and
Charles, diſcontent with the inimitable Simon, who had ſerved Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
and the Republic, ſent for Rotier's ſons. The two eldeſt, John
and Joſeph, arrived (not entirely with their father's conſent who
wiſhed to have them ſettle in France, of which I ſuppoſe he was a
native) They were immediately placed in the mint, and allowed a
ſalary and a houſe, where they ſoon grew rich, being allowed 200 <hi>l.</hi>
for each broad ſeal, and gaining 300<hi>l.</hi> a year by vending great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of medals abroad. On their ſucceſs, Philip the third brother
came over, and worked for the government too. He is the only one
of the three, though John was reckoned the beſt artiſt, who has left
his name <note n="*" place="bottom">Unleſs a medal which I have mentioned in the ſecond volume of this work, p. 41. was executed by Norbert.</note> or initials on any of our medals; and he it was I believe,
who being in love with the fair Mrs. Stuart, ducheſs of Richmond,

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0853300503:122"/>
of a large medal with the king's head. Simon, diſcontent with
ſome reaſon at the preference of ſuch inferior performers, made the
famous crown-piece, which though it did not explode the others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his own ſalary, and from that time he and his rivals lived
amicably together. It was more than they themſelves did. John
had three ſons, the eldeſt of which he loſt, but James and Norbert,
being much employed by him, their uncles grew jealous and left
England, Joſeph going to France, Philip to Flanders, where each
being entertained by the reſpective governments, the three brothers
were at the ſame time in the ſervice of three kings, of England, France
and Spain. James Rotier being hurt by a fall from his horſe, and
retiring to Bromley for the air, caught cold and died. Norbert and
his father remained working for the crown till the Revolution, when,
though offered to be continued in his poſt, no ſollicitation could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
on John the father to work for king William. This rendering
him obnoxious, and there being ſuſpicions <note n="*" place="bottom">There are many evidences that theſe and other ſuſpicions were not ill-founded. Rotier was believed to have both coined and furniſhed dies for coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money, I ſuppoſe with the ſtamp and for the ſervice of king James. Smith in his Memoirs of ſecret ſervice mentions his information and diſcovery of the dies in the Tower being conveyed away by one Hewet and others, by the help of Mr. Rotier, and that they were found at Mr. Vernon's in January 1695. In the Journals of the Houſe of Commons, vol. xi. p. 686, is a report from the Committee to examine what dies were gone out of the Tower and by what means. From that report it appears that Rotier wou'd not ſuffer captain Harris the patent-officer to enter the houſe where the dies were kept; that one Ware made a preſs for White, then under ſentence of condemnation, who told Ware he cou'd have dies from Rotier when he pleaſed: that Rotier, who was a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, kept an Iriſh papiſt in his houſe, and that the lord Lucas, governor of the Tower, had complained, that the Tower was not ſafe, while ſo many papiſts were entertained in Rotier's houſe. It appears too from the Journal of Henry Earl of Clarendon, that when his lordſhip, who by his own account had dealt with the moſt diſaffected perſons, was committed to the Tower in 1690, he aſked lord Lucas to let Rotier come to him, which the governor would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to do alone, becauſe he was a papiſt.—Lord Clarendon moſt probably had another reaſon for deſiring Rotier's company.</note> of his carrying on a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0853300503:123"/>
correſpondence, guards were placed round his houſe in the
Tower, and lord Lucas, who commanded there, made him ſo uneaſy
that he was glad to quit his habitation. He was rich and very infirm,
labouring under the ſtone and gravel, additional reaſons for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring.
He took a houſe in Red-lion-ſquare. Norbert, leſs difficult,
executed ſome things for the government, particularly, <note n="*" place="bottom">He and his brother James ſtruck a medal of king William alone in 1693, which was advertiſed, with another by them of Charles 1ſt.</note> as Vertue
thinks, the coronation medal for William and Mary, and ſome dies
for the copper money. On the proofs were the king's and queen's
heads on different ſides, with a roſe, a ſhip, &amp;c. but in 1694 it was
reſolved, that the heads ſhould be coupled, and Britannia be on the
reverſe. Hence aroſe new matter of complaint—Some penetrating
eyes thought they diſcovered a Satyr's head <note n="†" place="bottom">I remember ſuch a viſion about the firſt half-penny of the late king George II. The knee of Britannia was thought to repreſent a rat (a Hanoverian one) gnawing into her bowels.</note> couched in the king's.
This made much noiſe, and gave riſe to a report that king James was
in England, and lay concealed in Rotier's houſe in the Tower. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
on theſe diſſatisfactions left England, and retiring into France,
where he had been educated in the academy, was received and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0853300503:124"/>
by Louis XIV. where, whatever had been his inclinations
here, he certainly made ſeveral medals of the young chevalier.</p>
               <p>John, the father, ſurvived king William. A medal being ordered
of the new queen, Harris a player who ſucceeded Rotier, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of the office, employed workmen to do the buſineſs, among
whom was Mr. Croker, who afterwards obtained the place. Sir
Godfrey Kneller drew a profile of the queen, and Mr. Bird the ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
modelled it. Her majeſty did not like the eſſay, and recollected
Rotier, but was told the family had left England or were dead. Sir
Godfrey being ordered to inſpect the work, and going to the Tower,
learned that John Rotier was ſtill living, whom he viſited and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with what had happened. The old man, in a paſſion, began
a die, but died before he could finiſh it, in 1703, and was buried in
the Tower. The unfiniſhed die, with others of the twelve caeſars,
were ſent to France to his relations, whence two of them arrived,
hoping to be employed. One of them modelled the face of Sir Hans
Sloane, and ſtruck a ſilver medal of the duke of Beaufort; but not
meeting with ſucceſs, they returned. This entire account Vertue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in 1745 from two ſurviving ſiſters of Norbert Rotier. Their
mother, who had a portrait of her huſband John, which the daughters
ſent for, died in Flanders about 1720.</p>
               <p>Of the works of the Rotiers, ſome may be ſeen in Evelyn. John
made a large milled medal of duke Lauderdale in 1672, with the
graver's own name. Norbert, a medal of Charles I. (ſtruck about the
time of the Revolution) and another of his queen. One of them, I
know not which, graved a large medal of a Daniſh admiral, in the
reign of king James. A cornelian ſeal with the heads of Mars and
Venus, which Vertue ſaw, was cut by John Rotier. Of Joſeph, there
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0853300503:125"/>
is a print, while he was in the ſervice of the French king, and calling
him, "Cydevant graveur de la monoye de Charles II. d'Angleterre."</p>

ſmall encouragement to the arts. His religion was not of a

proſecutions, innovations, were not likely to make a figure

               <p>Of Paris, ſtudied firſt under Swanevelt, who had married one of his
relations, and then improved himſelf by a journey to Italy, practicing
ſolely in perſpective, architecture and landſcape. On his return home
he was employed at Marly, but being a proteſtant, he quitted his
work on the perſecution of his brethren, and retired to Swiſſerland.
Louvois invited him back; he refuſed, but ſent his deſigns, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
a proper perſon to execute them. After a ſhort ſtay in
Swiſſerland, he went to Holland, whence he was invited over by
Ralph duke of Montagu to adorn his new houſe in Bloomſbury,
where he painted much, and had the ſuperviſal of the building, and
even a hand in it. His work amounted to 1500 <hi>l.</hi> in lieu of which
the duke allowed him an annuity for his life of 200 <hi>l.</hi> a year. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it but two years, dying <note n="†" place="bottom">He was buried in St. Anne's.</note> in Soho-ſquare at the age of 68 about
1694. Some of his pictures, both in landſcape and architecture, are
over doors at Hampton-court; and he etched after ſome of his own
deſigns. He left a widow, but bequeathed moſt of what he had to
his fellow-ſufferers, the Refugèes. Lord Burlington had a portrait of
him by Le Fevre.</p>

the point in which their beſt maſters have failed. La Foſſe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to England by the duke of Montagu, mentioned in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
article, and painted two cielings for him, the Apotheoſis of Iſis,
and an Aſſembly of the Gods. The French author ſays that king
William preſſed him to ſtay here, but that he declined the offer, in
hopes of being appointed firſt painter to his own monarch. Parmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere
aſſiſted La Foſſe in laying the dead colours for him, in his works

               <p>N. HEUDE</p>
               <p>Lived about this time, and painted in the manner of Verrio, to whom
he is ſaid to have been aſſiſtant. He painted a ſtair-caſe at the lord
Tyrconnel's in Arlington-ſtreet, now demoliſhed, and a cieling at
Bulſtrode, in both which he placed his own portrait and name. He
was maſter of Mr. Carpenter, the ſtatuary.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DE KEISAR,</p>
               <p>Of Antwerp, was bred a jeweller, in which profeſſion he became very
eminent, but having been well educated and taught to draw, he had a
ſtrong bent towards that profeſſion, and employed all his leiſure on it,
practicing miniature, enamel, and oil-colours, both in ſmall and large.
Vertue ſays he fixed at laſt wholly on the former: Graham that he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0853300503:130"/>
painted in little after the manner of Elſheimer, that he imitated va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
manners, drew cattle and birds, and painted tombs and baſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs
in imitation of Vergazon, and that he worked ſome time with
Loten the landſcape-painter. This laſt circumſtance is not very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
for Vertue, who was acquainted with his daughter, gives a
very different account of his commencing painter by profeſſion.
Having painted ſome altar-pieces at Antwerp, his buſineſs called him
to Dunkirk, where he drew a picture for the altar of the Engliſh nuns.
They were ſo pleaſed with it, that they perſuaded Keiſar to go to
England, and gave him letters of recommendation to lord Melfort,
then in favour with king James. The enthuſiaſtic painter could not
reſiſt the propoſal; he embarked on board an Engliſh veſſel, and
without acquainting his wife or family, ſailed for England. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
was equal to his wiſhes. He was introduced to the king who
promiſed to countenance him, and ſeveral perſons of rank, who had
known him at Antwerp, encouraged him in his new vocation. Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
with his proſpect, he ſent for his wife, ordering her to diſmiſs
his workmen, and convert his effects into money.—Within half a year
the bubble burſt; the Revolution happened, Keiſar's friends could no
longer be his protectors, his buſineſs decreaſed, and the purſuit of the
Philoſopher's ſtone, to which he had recourſe in his deſpair, compleated
his ruin. He died at the age of 45 in four or five years after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.
He left a daughter whom he had taken great pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
in his favorite ſtudy, and with ſucceſs. She painted ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits
in oil and copied well; but marrying one Mr. Humble a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
he would not permit her to follow the proſeſſion. After his
death ſhe returned to it, and died in December 1724. She had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

               <p>THIS prince, like moſt of thoſe in our annals, contributed
nothing to the advancement of arts. He was born in a
country where taſte never flouriſhed, and nature had not given
it to him as an embelliſhment to his great qualities. He courted
Fame, but none of her miniſters. Holland owed it't preſervation to
his heroic virtue, England it's liberty to his ambition, Europe it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence
to his competition with Louis the fourteenth; for, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
unſucceſsful in the conteſt, the very ſtruggle was ſalutary. Being
obliged to draw all his reſources from himſelf, and not content to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
glory by proxy, he had no leiſure, like his rival, to preſide over
the regiſters of his fame. He fought his own battles, inſtead of
chooſing mottoes for the medals that recorded them; and though my
lord Halifax promiſed <note n="*" place="bottom">It has been obſerved that I have miſquoted lord Halifax, who does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe king William an immortality in tapeſtry for his wound, but tells him, the French would have flattered him in that manner.

His majeſty certainly did not beſpeak a ſingle ſuit of tapeſtry in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the action. In England he met with nothing but diſguſts.
He underſtood little of the nation, and ſeems to have acted too much
upon a plan formed before he came over, and however neceſſary to
his early ſituation, little adapted to ſo peculiar a people as the Engliſh.
He thought that valour and taciturnity would conquer or govern the
world, and vainly imagining that his new ſubjects loved liberty better
than party, he truſted to their feeling gratitude for a bleſſing which
they could not help ſeeing was conferred a little for his own ſake.
Reſerved, unſociable, ill in his health, and ſowered by his ſituation,
he ſought none of thoſe amuſements that make the hours of the happy
much happier. If we muſt except the palace at Hampton-court, at
leaſt it is no monument of his taſte; it ſeems erected in emulation of,
what it certainly was meant to imitate, the pompous edifices of the
French monarch. We are told that <q>

                     <l>To fix him gracefull on the bounding ſteed:</l>
                  </q>In general I believe his majeſty patronized neither painters, nor <note n="*" place="bottom">King William had ſo little leiſure to attend to, or ſo little diſpoſition to men of wit, that when St. Evremont was introduced to him, the king ſaid coldly, "I think you was a major-general in the French ſervice."</note>

a great prince may have a Garth, a Prior, a Montagu, and want
Titians and Vandycks, if he encourages neither—You muſt addreſs
yourſelf to a painter, if you wiſh to be flattered—a poet brings his
incenſe to you. Mary ſeems to have had little more propenſity to the
arts than the king: the good queen loved to work and talk, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
herſelf with praying to God that her huſband might be a great
hero, ſince he did not chuſe to be a fond huſband. A few men of
genius flouriſhed in their time, of whom the chief was</p>
               <p>Sir GODFREY KNELLER,</p>
               <p>A man leſſened by his own reputation, as he choſe to make it ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient

"Painters of hiſtory, ſaid he, make the dead live, and do not begin to live themſelves till they are dead.—I paint the living and they make me live."</note>. Had he lived in a country where his merit
had been rewarded according to the worth of his productions, inſtead
of the number, he might have ſhone in the roll of the greateſt maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
but he united the higheſt vanity with the moſt conſummate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence

fame, he ſacrificed twenty to lucre; and he met with cuſtomers of ſo

would gladly have diſowned his works the moment they were
paid for. Ten <note n="†" place="bottom">Charles II. James II. and his queen; William and Mary, Anne, George I. Louis XIV. Peter the Great, and the emperor Charles VI.

When he had finiſhed the picture of Louis XIV, that prince aſked him what mark of his eſteem wou'd be moſt agreable to him? he anſwered modeſtly and genteely, that if his majeſty would beſtow a quarter of an hour on him, that he might make a drawing of his head for himſelf, he ſhould think it the higheſt honour he could poſſibly receive.

who ſee king William, the Czar Peter, Marlborough, Newton, Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
Godolphin, Somers, the ducheſs of Grafton, lady Ranelagh, and
ſo many ornaments of an illuſtrious age, tranſmitted to us by Kneller's
pencil, muſt not regret that his talent was confined to portraits—
Perhaps the treaſure is greater, than if he had decorated the chambers
of Hampton-court with the wars of Aeneas or the enchanted palace of
Armida: and when one conſiders how ſeldom great maſters are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
employed, it is better to have real portraits, than Madonnas
without end. My opinion of what Sir Godfrey's genius could have
produced, muſt not be judged by the hiſtoric picture of king William
in the palace juſt mentioned: it is a tame and poor performance. But
the original ſketch of it at Houghton is ſtruck out with a ſpirit and
fire equal to Rubens. The hero and the horſe are in the heat of battle:
In the large piece, it is the king riding in triumph, with his uſual
phlegm. Of all his works, Sir Godfrey was moſt proud of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Chineſe at Windſor; but his portrait of Gibbons is ſuperior to
it. It has the freedom and nature of Vandyck, with the harmony of
colouring peculiar to Andrea Sacchi; and no part of it is neglected.
In general, even where he took pains, all the parts are affectedly kept
down, to throw the greater force into the head—a trick unworthy ſo

This fault, which in Kneller proceeded from haſte and rapaciouſneſs, was affectedly imitated by ſome of the painters who ſucceeded him, while his great reputation was ſtill in vogue. Yet with all Sir Godfrey's deſire of acquiring riches, he left 500 portraits unfiniſhed—for his cuſtomers were not equally ready to pay, as to ſit. There is an entertaining account of theſe facts in Rouquet's State of the Arts in England.</note> careleſly finiſhed, that they
reſemble no ſilk or ſtuff the world ever ſaw. His airs of heads have
extreme grace; the hair admirably diſpoſed, and if the locks ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
elevated, it muſt be conſidered as an inſtance of the painter's
art. He painted in an age when the women erected edifices of three
ſtories on their heads. Had he repreſented ſuch prepoſterous attire,
in half a century his works would have been ridiculous. To lower
their dreſs to a natural level when the eye was accuſtomed to pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids,
would have ſhocked their prejudices and diminiſhed the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.—He
took a middle way and weighed out ornament to them
of more natural materials. Still it muſt be owned, there is too great
a ſameneſs in his airs, and no imagination at all in his compoſitions.
See but a head, it intereſts you—uncover the reſt of the canvaſs, you
wonder faces ſo expreſſive could be employed ſo inſipidly. In truth,
the age demanded nothing correct, nothing compleat. Capable of
taſting the power of Dryden's numbers, and the majeſty of Kneller's
heads, it overlooked doggrel and daubing. What pity that men of
fortune are not bleſt with ſuch a pen or ſuch a pencil! That a genius
muſt write for a bookſeller, or paint for an alderman!</p>

of the mines and inſpector of count Mansfeldt's revenues. By his
wife of the family of Crowſen, he had one ſon Zachary, educated at
Leipſic, and for ſome time in the ſervice of Guſtavus Adolphus's
widow. After her death, he removed to Lubec, married, profeſſed
architecture, and was chief ſurveyor to his native City. He left two
ſons, John Zachary, and Godfrey. The latter, who at firſt was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
for a military life, was ſent to Leyden, where he applied to
mathematics and fortification; but the predominance of nature deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
him to painting, his father acquieſced and ſent him to Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
where he ſtudied under Bol, and had ſome inſtructions from
Rembrandt. Vertue nor any of his biographers take notice of it,
nor do I aſſert it, but I have heard that one of his maſters was
Francis Hals. It is certain that Kneller had no ſervility of a diſciple,
nor imitated any of them. Even in Italy whither he went in 1672,
he mimicked no peculiar ſtyle, nor even at Venice where he reſided
moſt and was eſteemed and employed by ſome of the firſt families,
and where he drew cardinal Baſſadonna. If he caught any thing, it
was inſtructions not hints. If I ſee the leaſt reſemblance in his works
to any other maſter, it is in ſome of his earlieſt works in England,
and thoſe his beſt, to Tintoret. A portrait at Houghton of Joſeph
Carreras, a poet and chaplain to Catherine of Liſbon, has the force
and ſimplicity of that maſter, without owing part of it's merit to Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toret's
univerſal black drapery, to his own, afterwards, neglected
draperies, or to his maſter Rembrandt's unnatural Chiaro Scuro.
Latterly Sir Godfrey was thought to give into the manner of Rubens;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0853300503:143"/>
I ſee it no where but in the ſketch of king William's equeſtrian figure,
evidently imitated from Rubens's deſign of the cieling for the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-houſe,
which, as I have ſaid, in the life of that painter, was
in Kneller's poſſeſſion. The latter had no more of Rubens's rich
colouring, than of Vandyck's delicacy in habits; but he had more
beauty than the latter, more dignity than Sir Peter Lely. The latter
felt his capacity in a memorable inſtance; Kneller and his brother
came to England in 1674 without intending to reſide here, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
through France to Venice. They were recommended to Mr.
Banks, a Hamburgh-merchant, and Godfrey drew him and his family.
The pictures pleaſed. Mr. Vernon, ſecretary to the duke of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
ſaw them, and ſat to the new painter, and obtained his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
picture by the ſame hand. The duke was ſo charmed, that he
engaged the king his father to ſit to Kneller, at a time that the duke
of York had been promiſed the king's picture by Lely. Charles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to have double trouble, propoſed that both the artiſts ſhould
draw him at the ſame time. Lely as an eſtabliſhed maſter, choſe the
light he liked: the ſtranger was to draw the picture as he could; and
performed it with ſuch facility and expedition, that his piece was in a
manner finiſhed, when Lely's was only dead-coloured. The novelty
pleaſed—yet Lely deſerved moſt honour, for he did juſtice to his
new competitor; confeſſed his abilities and the likeneſs. This ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
fixed Kneller here. The ſeries of his portraits prove the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his reputation.</p>
               <p>Charles II. ſent him to Paris to draw Louis XIV. but died in his
abſence. The ſucceſſor was equally favorable to him, and was ſitting
for his picture for ſecretary Pepys, when he received the news that the
prince of Orange was landed.</p>

King William diſtinguiſhed Kneller ſtill more; for <note n="*" place="bottom">They were painted in his reign, but the thought was the queen's, during one of the king's abſences; and contributed much to make her unpopular, as I have heard from the authority of the old counteſs of Carliſle (daughter of Arthur earl of Eſſex) who died within theſe few years and remembered the event. She added, that the famous lady Dorcheſter adviſed the queen againſt it, ſaying, "Madam, if the king was to aſk for the portraits of all the wits in his court, wou'd not the reſt think he called them fools?"</note> that prince he
painted the beauties at Hampton-court, and was knighted by him in
1692, with the additional preſent of a gold medal and chain weighing

queen Anne he painted the king of Spain, afterwards Charles VI.
ſo poor a performance that one would think he felt the fall from Peter
to Charles. His works in the gallery of <note n="†" place="bottom">Seven of thoſe heads are by Kneller, the reſt by Dahl.</note> Admirals were done in the
ſame reign, and ſeveral of them worthy ſo noble a memorial. The
Kit-cat-club, generally mentioned as a ſet of wits, in reality the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots
that ſaved Britain, were Kneller's laſt works in that reign, and his
laſt public work. He lived to draw George I. was made a baronet
by him, and continued to paint during the greater part of his reign;
but in 1722 Sir Godfrey was ſeized with a violent fever, from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
danger of which he was reſcued by Dr. Meade. The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
however fell on his left arm; and it was opened. He remained
in a languiſhing condition and died Oct. 27, 1723. His body lay in
ſtate, and was buried at Witton, but a monument was erected in
Weſtminſter-abbey <note n="‡" place="bottom">His monument, executed by Ryſbrach, was directed by himſelf; he leſt 300<hi>l.</hi> for it.</note>, where his friend Mr. Pope, as if to gratify an

him a tranſlation of Raphael's epitaph—as high a compliment as even
poetry could be allowed to pay to the original; a ſilly hyperbole
when applied to the modern. This was not the only inſtance in which
the poet incenſed the painter. Sir Godfrey had drawn for him the
ſtatues of Apollo, Venus and Hercules; Pope paid for them with theſe
lines,<q>
                     <l>What god, what genius did the pencil move,</l>
                     <l>When Kneller painted theſe!</l>
                     <l>'Twas friendſhip, warm as Phaebus, kind as love,</l>
                     <l>And ſtrong as Hercules.</l>
                  </q>He was in the right to ſuppreſs them—what idea does muſcular
friendſhip convey? It was not the ſame <note n="*" place="bottom">Pope's character of Helluo is believed to allude to Sir Godfrey.</note> warmth of friendſhip that
made Pope put Kneller's vanity to the ſtrongeſt trial imaginable. The
former laid a wager that there was no flattery ſo groſs but his friend
would ſwallow. To prove it, Pope ſaid to him as he was painting,
"Sir Godfrey, I believe if God Almighty had had your aſſiſtance,
the world would have been formed more perfect." "Fore God, Sir,
replied Kneller, I believe ſo." This impious anſwer was not extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in the latter.—His converſation on religion was extremely
free.—His <note n="†" place="bottom">In the ſame ſtrain he ſaid to a low fellow whom he over-heard curſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; "God damn <hi>you</hi>! God may damn the duke of Marlborough, and perhaps Sir Godfrey Kneller; but do you think he will take the trouble of damning ſuch a ſcoundrel as you!" The ſame vanity that cou'd think itſelf intitled to preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence even in horrors, alighted on a juſter diſtinction, when he told his taylor, who offended him by propoſing his ſon for an apprentice, "Doſt thou think, man, <hi>I</hi> can make thy ſon a painter! No; God almighty only makes painters."</note> paraphraſe on a particular text of ſcripture, ſingular. "In
my father's houſe are many manſions;" which Sir Godfrey interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0853300503:146"/>
thus. "At the day of judgment, ſaid he, God will examine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
on their different profeſſions: to one he will ſay, Of what ſect
was you? I was a Papiſt—go you there. What was you? A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant—go
you there.—And you?—A Turk—go you there.—And
you, Sir Godfrey?—I was of no ſect—then God will ſay, Sir Godfrey,
chuſe your place." His wit was ready; his bonmots deſervedly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired.
In great Queen-ſtreet <note n="*" place="bottom">He firſt lived in Durham-yard, then 21 years in Covent-garden, and laſtly in great Queen-ſtreet, Lincoln's-inn-fields.</note> he lived next door to Dr. Ratcliffe;
Kneller was fond of flowers, and had a fine collection. As there was
great intimacy between him and the phyſician, he permitted the latter
to have a door into his garden, but Ratcliffe's ſervants gathering and
deſtroying the flowers, Kneller ſent him word he muſt ſhut up the door.
—Ratcliffe replied peeviſhly, "Tell him he may do any thing with
it but paint it.—And I, anſwered Sir Godfrey, can take any thing
from him but phyſic." Sir Godfrey at Witton acted as Juſtice of
Peace, and was ſo much more ſwayed by Equity than Law, that his
judgments accompanied with humour are ſaid to have occaſioned thoſe
lines by Pope.<q>
                     <l>I think Sir Godfrey ſhould decide the ſuit,</l>
                     <l>Who ſent the Thief (that ſtole the caſh) away,</l>
                     <l>And puniſh'd him that put it in his way.</l>
                  </q>This alluded to his diſmiſſing a ſoldier who had ſtolen a joint of meat,
and accuſed the butcher of having tempted him by it. Whenever Sir
Godfrey was applied to, to determine what pariſh a poor man belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to, he always inquired which pariſh was the richer, and ſettled the
poor man there; nor wou'd ever ſign a warrant to diſtrain the goods
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0853300503:147"/>
of a poor man, who could not pay a tax. Theſe inſtances ſhowed
the goodneſs of his heart; others, even in his capacity of juſtice, his
peculiar turn; a handſome young woman came before him to ſwear a
rape; ſtruck with her beauty, he continued examining her, as he ſat
painting, till he had taken her likeneſs. If he diſliked interruption,
he would not be interrupted. Seeing a conſtable coming to him at
the head of a mob, he called to him, without inquiring into the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair;
"Mr. Conſtable, you ſee that turning; go that way, and you
will find an ale-houſe, the ſign of the king's head—go, and make
it up."</p>
               <p>He married Suſannah Cawley, daughter of the miniſter of Henley
upon Thames. She out-lived him and was buried at Henley, where
are monuments for her and her father. Before his marriage, Sir
Godfrey had an intrigue with a Quaker's wife, whom he purchaſed of
her huſband, and had a daughter, whoſe portrait he drew like St. Agnes
with a lamb; there is a print of it by Smith. Kneller had amaſſed a
great fortune, though he lived magnificently, and loſt 20,000<hi>l.</hi> in the
South-ſea; yet he had an eſtate of near 2000<hi>l.</hi> a year left. Part he
bequeathed to his wife, and entailed the reſt on Godfrey Huckle, his
daughter's ſon, with orders that he ſhould aſſume the name of Knel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
To three neices at Hamburgh, the children of his brother, he
left legacies; and an annuity of 100<hi>l.</hi> a year to Bing, an old ſervant,
who with his brother had been his Aſſiſtants. Of theſe he had many,
as may be concluded from the quantity of his works, and the badneſs
of ſo many. His chief performers were, Pieters, Vander Roer, and
Bakker—ſometimes he employed Baptiſt and Vergazon. His prices
were fifteen guineas for a head, twenty if with one hand, thirty for a
half, and ſixty for a whole length.</p>

Kneller frequently drew his own portrait; my father had one, a
head when young, and a ſmall one of the ſame age, very maſterly; it
is now mine. It was engraved by Becket. Another in a wig; by
Smith. A half-length ſent to the Tuſcan gallery. A half-length in
a brocaded waiſtcoat with his gold chain; there is a mezzotinto of it,
accompanying the Kit-cat-heads. Another head with a cap; a half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>length
preſented to the gallery at Oxford, and a double piece of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his wife. Great numbers of his works have been engraved,
particularly by Smith, who has more than done juſtice to them; the
draperies are preferable to the originals. The firſt print taken from
his works was by White of Charles II. He had an hiſtoric piece of
his own painting before he went to Italy, Tobit and the Angel. At
his ſeat at Witton were many of his own works, ſold ſome years after
his death. He intended that Sir James Thornhill ſhould paint the
ſtaircaſe there, but hearing that Sir Iſaac Newton was ſitting to Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,
Kneller was offended, ſaid, no portrait-painter ſhould paint his
houſe, and employed Laguerre.</p>
               <p>Pope was not the only bard that ſoothed this painter's vain-glory.
Dryden repaid him for a preſent of Shakeſpeare's picture with a copy
of verſes full of luxuriant but immortal touches; the moſt beautiful
of Addiſon's poetic works was addreſſed to him: the ſingular happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the alluſions, and applications of fabulous theology to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
drawn by Kneller, is very remarkable:<q>
                     <l>Great Pan, who wont to chaſe the fair,</l>
                     <l>And love the ſpreading oak was there,</l>
                  </q>For Charles II.—And for James,</p>

                  <q>
                     <l>Old Saturn too with upcaſt eyes</l>

And the reſt on William and Mary, Anne, and George I. are all
ſtamped with the moſt juſt reſemblance.</p>
               <p>Prior complimented Kneller on the duke of Ormond's picture;
Steele wrote a poem to him at Witton; Tickell another; and there
is one in the third part of Miſcellaneous Poems 8vo. Lond. 1693, on
the portrait of the lady Hyde. Can one wonder a man was vain, who
had been flattered by Dryden, Addiſon, Prior, Pope and Steele? Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph
Harris dedicated to him his Tragi-comedy of the Miſtakes or
Falſe Report in 1690, in which Dryden, Tate, and Mountford had
aſſiſted. And John Smith (I ſuppoſe the celebrated mezzotinter) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
his tranſlation of Le Brun's Conference on the Paſſions to Sir
Godfrey. On his death was written another Poem printed in a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellany
publiſhed by D. Lewis, 8vo. in 1726. His Brother</p>
               <p>JOHN ZACHARY KNELLER,</p>
               <p>Who was thirteen years older than Sir Godfrey, came to England with
him, and painted in freſco, architecture, and ſtill-life, ſmall pieces in
oil, and laſtly in water-colours, in which he copied ſeveral of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
heads. Sir Godfrey drew his portrait, one of his beſt works.
Of John's was a piece of ſtill-life with a great tankard in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
and a ſmall head of Wyck, almoſt profile in oil, in the poſſeſſion
of Dr. Barnard biſhop of Derry, with the names of both artiſts, dated
1684. John Kneller died in 1702 in Covent-garden and was buried
in that church.</p>
               <p>JOHN JAMES BAKKER</p>
               <p>Painted draperies for Kneller, and went to Bruſſels with him in 1697,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0853300503:150"/>
where Sir Godfrey drew the elector of Bavaria on a white horſe. I
don't know whether Bakker ever practiced for himſelf. He was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Adrian Bakker, who painted hiſtory and portraits at Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
and died in 1686.</p>
               <p>JACOB VANDER ROER,</p>
               <p>Another of Kneller's aſſiſtants, was ſcholar of J. De Baan, and lived
many years in London; died at Dort. See an account of him in the
third volume of Deſcamps.</p>
               <p>JOHN PIETERS</p>
               <p>Was born at Antwerp, and learned of Eykens, a hiſtory-painter. He
came to England in 1685, at the age of eighteen <note n="*" place="bottom">He was ſo poor that he engaged himſelf as a domeſtic in the ſervice of cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Dada, the pope's nuntio; but quitted him before night.</note>, and was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended

Pieters and Bakker were both kind to

               <p>One of the greateſt maſters that has appeared for painting flowers.
They are not ſo exquiſitely finiſhed as Van Huyſum's, but his colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and compoſition are in a bolder ſtyle. He was born at Liſle in
1635, and educated at Antwerp as a painter of hiſtory, which he ſoon
changed for flowers, and going to Paris in 1663 was received into the
academy with applauſe; and though his ſubjects were not thought
elevated enough to admit him to a profeſſorſhip, he was in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his merit made a counſellor; a ſilly diſtinction, as if a great
painter in any branch, was not ſitter to profeſs that branch, than give
advice on any other. He was employed at Verſailles, Trianon, Marly,
and Meudon; and painted in the hotel de Bretonvilliers at Paris, and
other houſes. The duke of Montagu brought him to England, where
much of his hand is to be ſeen, at Montagu-houſe, Hampton-court,
the duke of St. Albans's at Windſor, Kenſington, lord Carliſle's, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington-houſe,

a ſincere confeſſion from the Engliſh, "Qu'on ne peut aller plus
loin en fait de peinture." Baptiſt is undoubtedly capital in his way—
but they muſt be ignorant Engliſhmen indeed, who can ſee any thing
maſterly in the two others. Baptiſt paſſed and repaſſed ſeveral times
between France and England, but having married his daughter to a
French painter who was ſuffered to alter and touch upon his pictures,
Baptiſt was offended and returned to France no more. He died in
Pallmall in 1699. His ſon Antony, called young Baptiſt, painted in
his father's manner, and had merit. There is a good print by White

landſcape and hiſtory-painting. He died here about 1699, at the

               <p>SIMON DUBOIS,</p>
               <p>Was a better maſter. He lived 25 years at home, but came to
England as early as 1685, ſeveral ſmall heads in oil being dated in
that year; they are commonly diſtinguiſhed by the faſhion of that
time, laced cravats. Portrait however was not his excellence; origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
he painted battles, ſmall, and in the Italian manner; afterwards,
horſes <note n="*" place="bottom">He had received ſome inſtructions from Wouverman.</note> and cattle, with figures, the faces of which were ſo neatly
finiſhed, that a lady perſuaded him to try likeneſſes, and ſat to him
herſelf. He ſold many of his pieces for originals by Italian hands,
ſaying ſenſibly, that ſince the world would not do him juſtice, he
would do it himſelf; his works ſold well, when his name was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.
Lord Somers diſtinguiſhed better; he went unknown and
ſat to Dubois; and going away gave him 50 guineas, ordered the
robes of chancellor, and when the picture <note n="†" place="bottom">Elſum has an epigram on this picture.</note> was finiſhed, gave him
as much more. The two brothers lived together in Covent-garden
without any ſervant, working in obſcurity, and heaping up money,
both being avaricious. When Edward died, Simon, left without
ſociety, began to work for Vandevelde, and one day in a fit of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
offered to draw the portrait of his eldeſt daughter. This drew
on a nearer acquaintance, and the old man married her, but died in a
year, leaving her his money, and a fine collection of pictures, and
naming his patron lord Somers executor; he was buried May 26,
1708. His young widow married again, and diſſipated the fortune

               <p>HENRY COOKE</p>
               <p>Was born in 1642, and was thought to have a talent for hiſtory. He
went to Italy, and ſtudied under Salvator Roſa. On his return,
neither rich nor known, he lived obſcurely in Knave's-acre, in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip
with a houſe-painter. Lutterel introduced him to Sir Godfrey
Copley, who was pleaſed with his works, and carried him into York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire

received 150<hi>l.</hi> He then lived five years with the father of Antony
Ruſſel, whom I have mentioned in the preceding volume, but quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with a man about a miſtreſs whom Cooke kept, by whom he had
children, and whom he afterwards married, Cooke killed him and

               <p>PETER BERCHETT</p>
               <p>Was born in France, 1659, and beginning to draw at the age of 15
under La Foſſe, he improved ſo faſt, that in three years he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the royal palaces. He came to England in 1681, to work
under Rambour, a French painter of architecture, who, ſays Vertue,
was living in 1721, but then ſtaid only a year, and returned to Marli.
He came again, and painted for ſome perſons of rank in the weſt.
King William building a palace at Loo, ſent Berchett thither, where
he was engaged fifteen months, and then came a third time to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
where he had ſufficient buſineſs. He painted the cieling in the
chapel of Trinity-college, Oxford, the ſtaircaſe at the duke of Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg's
in Pallmall, and the ſummer-houſe at Ranelagh. His drawings
in the academy were much approved. Towards the end of his life,
being troubled with a ptyſic, he retired to Marybone and painted
only ſmall pieces of fabulous hiſtory; his laſt was a bacchanalian, to
which he put his name the day before he died; it was in January
1720, at Marybone, where he was buried. He left a ſon that died
ſoon after him at the age of ſeventeen.</p>
               <p>LOUIS CHERON,</p>
               <p>Born at Paris in 1660, was ſon of Henry Cheron, an enamel painter,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0853300503:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and brother of Elizabeth Sophia Cheron, an admired paintreſs, and
who engraved many ancient gems. Louis went to Italy, and ſays the
* author of his life, "A toujours cherchè Raphael &amp; Jules Romain."
—A purſuit in which he was by no means ſucceſsfull. He came to
England on account of his religion in 1695, and was employed at the
duke of Montagu's at Boughton, at Burleigh, and at Chatſworth,
where he painted the ſides of the gallery, a very poor performance.
He had before fallen into diſeſteem, when he painted at Montagu-houſe,
where he was much ſurpaſſed by Baptiſt, Rouſſeau and La
Foſſe. On this ill-ſucceſs he turned to painting ſmall hiſtories; but
his beſt employment was deſigning for the painters and engravers of
that time; few books appeared with plates, but from his drawings.
Vanderbank, Vandergutch, Simpſon, Kirkall, &amp;c. all made uſe of
him. His drawings are ſaid to be preferable to his paintings. He
etched ſeveral of his own deſigns, as the labours of Hercules, which
were afterwards retouched with the burin by his diſciple, Gerard Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergutch;
and towards the end of his life Cheron etched from his
own drawings a ſuite of twenty-two ſmall hiſtories for the life of
David; they were done for, or at leaſt afterwards purchaſed by P. F.
Giffart, a bookſeller at Paris, who applied them to a verſion of the
Pſalms in French metre, publiſhed in 1715. Some time before his
death, Cheron ſold his drawings from Raphael, and his academic
figures to the earl of Derby for a large ſum. He was a man of a fair
character, and dying in 1713 of an apoplexy, left 20<hi>l.</hi> a year to his
maid, and the reſt of his fortune to his relations and to charitable uſes.
He was buried from his lodgings in the piazza of Covent-garden,
and lies in the great porch of that church.

                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0853300503:159"/>JOHN RILEY</p>
               <p>One of the beſt native painters that has flouriſhed in England, whoſe
talents while living were obſcured by the fame, rather than by the
merit of Kneller, and depreſſed ſince by being confounded with Lely;
an honour unlucky to his reputation. Graham too ſpeaks of him
with little juſtice, ſaying he had no excellence beyond a head; which
is far from true. I have ſeen both draperies and hands painted by
Riley, that would do honour to either Lely or Kneller. The portrait
of lord-keeper North at Wroxton is capital throughout. Riley, who
was humble, modeſt, and of an amiable character, had the greateſt
diffidence of himſelf, and was eaſily diſguſted with his own works,
the ſource probably of the objections made to him. With a quarter
of Sir Godfrey's vanity, he might have perſuaded the world he was as
great a maſter.</p>
               <p>He was born <note n="†" place="bottom">One Thomas Riley was an Actor, and has a copy of verſes addreſſed to him in Randolph's poems. This might be the painter's father.

Zouſt, but was little noticed till the death of Lely, when Chiffinch

him to the king. Charles ſat to him, but almoſt diſcouraged
the baſhfull artiſt from purſuing a profeſſion ſo proper for him.
Looking at the picture he cried "Is this like me? then, od's fiſh, I
am an ugly fellow." This diſcouraged Riley ſo much, that he could
not bear the picture, though he ſold it for a large price. James and
his queen ſat to him. So did their ſucceſſors, and appointed him

died in 1691 at the age of 45, and was buried in Biſhopſgate-church;
in which pariſh he was born. Richardſon married a near relation of
Riley, and inherited about 800<hi>l.</hi> in pictures, drawings and effects.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLOSTERMAN.</p>
               <p>Son of a painter, was born at Oſnabrugh, and with his countryman,
one Tiburen, went to Paris in 1679, where he worked for De Troye.
In 1681, they came to England, and Cloſterman at firſt painted dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries
for Riley, and afterwards they painted in conjunction, Riley ſtill
executing moſt of the heads. On his death Cloſterman finiſhed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of his pictures, which recommended him to the duke of Somerſet,
who had employed Riley. He painted the duke's children, but loſt
his favour on a diſpute about a picture of Guercino which he had
bought for his grace, and which was afterwards purchaſed by lord
Halifax; and on which occaſion the duke patronized Dahl. Cloſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
however did not want buſineſs. He drew Gibbons the carver
and his wife in one <note n="*" place="bottom">There is a mezzotinto from it.</note> piece, which pleaſed, and Cloſterman was even
ſet in competition with Sir Godfrey. He painted the duke and
ducheſs of Marlborough and all their children in one picture, and the
duke on horſe-back, on which ſubject however he had ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
with the ducheſs, that the duke ſaid, "It has given me more
trouble to reconcile my wife and you, than to fight a battle." Cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terman,
who ſought reputation, went to Spain, where he drew the
king and queen, and from whence he wrote ſeveral letters on the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in that country to Mr. Richard Graham. He alſo went twice
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0853300503:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Italy, and brought over ſeveral good pictures. The whole length
of queen Anne at Guildhall is by him, and another at Chatſworth of
the firſt duke of Rutland; and in Painter's-hall a portrait of Mr.
Saunders. Elſum has beſtowed an epigram on his portrait of Dryden;

time, but returned to and died in Scotland, and was buried in the

painted moſt of the Scotch nobility, but was not rich, having twenty

one La Zoon, a portrait-painter, and then with Fleſhiere, but owed
his chief improvement to his own application. He lived ſeveral
years in Yorkſhire; and when he came to London again, painted
draperies for ſir Godfrey Kneller, in which branch he was eminent;
but his greateſt excellence was in imitating other maſters, and thoſe
conſiderable. My father had a picture by him that eaſily paſſed for
Baſſan's. He painted hiſtory, portraits, converſations, both in large
and ſmall. Several prints were made from his works, and ſeveral

London, and the proceſſion at the coronation of William and Mary

of thoſe in his work. The ſubſtance of it is, that though born to an
eſtate, he could not reſiſt his impulſe to drawing, which made him
ramble over great part of Europe to ſtudy painting, which he ſcarcely
ever practiced, drawing only in black and white, and carried him to
Grand Cairo, where, as he could ſee no pictures, I am ſurprized he
did not take to painting. Moſt of his performances were produced
over a bottle, and took root where they were born: the Mitre
Tavern at Stock's market, and the Bell at Weſtminſter were adorned
by this jovial artiſt. At the former was a room called <hi>the Amſterdam,</hi>
from the variety of ſects Mr. Le Piper had painted in it, particularly
a Jeſuit and a Quaker. One branch of his genius, that does not ſeem
quite ſo good humoured as the reſt of his character, was a talent for
caricaturas. He drew landſcapes, etched on ſilver plates for the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-boxes
of his friends, and underſtood perſpective. Towards
the end of his life, his circumſtances were reduced enough to make
him glad of turning his abilities to ſome account.—Becket paid him
for deſigning his mezzotintos. Several heads of grand ſigniors in ſir
Paul Rycaut's hiſtory were drawn by him, and engraved by Elder.
At laſt, Le Piper took to modelling in wax, and thought he could
have made a figure in it, if he had begun ſooner. On the death of
his mother, his fortune being re-eſtabliſhed, he launched again into a
courſe of pleaſure, contracted a fever, and being bled by an ignorant
ſurgeon who pricked an artery, he died of it in 1698, in Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
and was buried in the church of St. Mary Magdalen Bermond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey
in Southwark. Vertue had a large picture by Fuller, containing
the portraits of ſeveral painters and of one woman; the perſon in the
middle was Le Piper.

he once drew king William, but as the piece was to be by candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
he gave his majeſty the candle to hold, till the tallow ran down

him at Althorp; at Windſor is a well-known picture in the gallery.

long, and got much money. He returned to Holland, and was made

               <p>A Landſcape-painter, reſided in London about the year 1690

One day ſitting down to paint, he could do nothing to pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
He made a new attempt, with no better ſucceſs. Throwing
down his pencils, he ſtretched himſelf out to ſleep, when thruſting

related to the gentleman who bought the picture. His drawings are

               <p>Born in London about 1672, was a portrait-painter, and happy in
taking likeneſſes, but I ſuppoſe never excellent, as his price was but
five guineas for a ¾ cloth. He married the daughter of one Green,
an attorney, by whom he had ſeveral children, of which one ſon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his father's profeſſion. In 1704 the father reſided in Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,
and afterwards near Covent-garden. He died an aged man in
the Charter-houſe. Beſides painting, he performed on the violin and
flute, and played at the concert held at the houſe of that extraordinary
perſon, Thomas Britton, the ſmallcoal-man, whoſe picture he twice
drew, one of which portraits was purchaſed by Sir Hans Sloane, and
is now in the Britiſh Muſeum. There is a mezzotinto from it. T.
Britton, who made much noiſe in his time, conſidering his low ſtation
and trade, was a collector of all ſorts of curioſities, particularly draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
prints, books, manuſcripts on uncommon ſubjects, as myſtic
divinity, the philoſopher's ſtone, judicial aſtrology, and magic; and
muſical inſtruments, both in and out of vogue. Various were the
opinions concerning him: Some thought his muſical aſſembly only a
cover for ſeditious meetings; others for magical purpoſes. He was
taken for an Atheiſt, a Preſbyterian, a Jeſuit. But Woolaſton the
painter and the father of a gentleman from whom I received this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and who were both members of the muſic-club, aſſured him
that Britton was a plain, ſimple, honeſt man, who only meaned to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe
himſelf. The ſubſcription was but ten ſhillings a year: Britton
found the inſtruments, and they had coffee at a penny a diſh. Sir
Hans Sloane bought many of his books, and MSS. (now in the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum)

               <p>JOHN SCHNELL,</p>
               <p>Of whom, or of his works, ſays Vertue, I never heard, except from
his epitaph in St. James's-church-yard at Briſtol. H. S. E. John
Schnell, portrait-painter, born at Baſil April 28, 1672, died Nov. 24,
1714. One Linton was a painter of ſeveral citizens in this reign,
from whoſe works there are prints. Theſe trifling notices, as I have
ſaid, are only inſerted, to lead to farther diſcoveries, or to aſſiſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies

               <p>A German, came over as a ſoldier in king William's Dutch troops,
obtained his diſcharge, and remained here ſeveral years, dying, it is
ſaid, in queen Anne's reign. He painted landſcapes, flowers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects
neatly in water-colours, but with too little knowledge of chiaro
ſcuro. He ſold a few of his works to collectors, and the reſt, being
very poor, to printſellers. They are now very ſcarce. Mr. Willett,
a merchant and virtuoſo in Thames-ſtreet, has about thirty, and Mr.
Chadd, jeweller in Bond-ſtreet, about a dozen.

               <p>Vertue ſays he had ſeen two drawings in black-lead by the biſhop of
Ely, the one of arch-biſhop Dolben from Loggan, the other of arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
Teniſon from White, but he does not ſpecify the name of the
biſhop. If theſe portraits were done at the time of Teniſon being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
it was probably Simon Patrick biſhop of Ely, who, ſays his
epitaph, was illuſtrious, Optimis artibus colendis promovendiſque.
But if it was the biſhop, living when Vertue's MS. is dated, which is,
1725, it was Dr. Thomas Green. Graham mentions another prelate,</p>

               <p>Daughter of Gibſon the dwarf and wife of a jeweller, painted in water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colours
with great freedom. In Mr. Roſe's ſale 1723, was a half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>length
miniature of an embaſſador from Morocco, eight inches by ſix,
painted by her in 1682, with the embaſſador's names on it; he ſat to
her and to Sir Godfrey Kneller at the ſame time. I have the portrait

               <p>JOHN BUSHNELL,</p>
               <p>An admired ſtatuary in his own time, but only memorable to us by a
capricious character. He was ſcholar of Burman, who having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
his ſervant-maid, obliged Buſhnell to marry her. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in diſguſt left England, ſtaid two years in France, and from
thence went to Italy. He lived ſome time at Rome and at Venice;
in the laſt city he made a magnificent monument for a Procuratore di
San Marco, repreſenting the ſeige of Candia, and a naval engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the Venetians and Turks. He came home through
Germany by the way of Hamburgh. Some of his firſt works after
his return were the Statues of Charles I, and II, at the Royal-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0853300503:183"/>
and Sir Thomas Greſham there above ſtairs. His beſt were
the kings at Temple-bar. He carved ſeveral marble monuments,
particularly one for lord Aſhburnham in Suſſex; one for Dr. Grew's
wife in Chriſt-church London, one for lord Thomond in Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſhire;
Cowley's and Sir Palmes Fairborn's in Weſtminſter-abbey,
and cut a head of Mr. Talman. He had agreed to compleat the ſet
of kings at the Royal-exchange, but hearing that another perſon (I
ſuppoſe, Cibber) had made intereſt to carve ſome of them, Buſhnell
would not proceed, though he had begun ſix or ſeven. Some of his
profeſſion aſſerting that, though he was ſkillfull in drapery, he could
not execute a naked figure, he engaged in an Alexander the Great,
which ſerved to prove that his rivals were in the right, at leaſt in what
he could <hi>not</hi> do. His next whim was to demonſtrate the poſſibility of
the Trojan horſe, which he had heard treated as a fable that could not
have been put in execution. He undertook ſuch a wooden receptacle,
and had the dimenſions made in timber, intending to cover it with
ſtucco. The head was capable of containing twelve men ſitting
round a table; the eyes ſerved for windows. Before it was half com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
a ſtorm of wind overſet and demoliſhed it, and though two
Vintners, who had contracted with him to uſe his horſe as a drinking
booth, offered to be at the expence of erecting it again, he was too
much diſappointed to recommence. This project coſt him 500<hi>l.</hi>
Another, of veſſels for bringing coals to London, miſcarried too, with
deeper coſt. Theſe ſchemes, with the loſs of an eſtate that he had
bought in Kent, by a law-ſuit, quite overſet his diſordered brain.
He died in 1701, and was buried at Paddington, leaving two ſons
and a daughter. The ſons, of whom one had 100<hi>l.</hi> a year, the other
60<hi>l.</hi> were as great humouriſts as the Father; they lived in a large

houſe fronting Hyde-park, in the lane leading from Piccadilly to
Tyburn, which had been built by the father, but was unfiniſhed, and
had neither ſtair-caſe nor floors. Here they dwelt like hermits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe
from all mankind, ſordid and impracticable, and ſaying the
world had not been worthy of their father. Vertue in one of his MSS.
dated 1725, begins thus; After long expectations I ſaw the inſide of
John Buſhnell's houſe, the ſons being abroad both." He deſcribes it
particularly, and what fragments he ſaw there, particularly a model
in plaiſter of Charles II. on horſeback, deſigned to have been caſt in
braſs, but almoſt in ruins: the Alexander and the unfiniſhed kings.
Againſt the wall a large piece of his painting, a triumph, almoſt

iron, thicker than a man's wriſt, broken by an invention of Buſhnell.</p>

               <p>A ſtatuary, made a tomb in the church of Stratford upon Avon,

               <p>Was a carver in ivory born at Dieppe; was many years in England,
and cut a great number of heads in baſ-relief, and ſome whole
figures in ivory: Mr. Weſt has his head carved by himſelf, oval.
Lord Oxford had the buſt of lord Somers by him. He alſo did one
of Sir Iſaac Newton, another was a profile of Charles Marbury, ſet in
a frame of looking-glaſs. Mr. Willet has another head of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

               <p>Born at Weſt-Lavington in Wiltſhire, where he had an eſtate, was
comptroller of the works in the reign of king William, but of his life
I find ſcarce any particulars, though he was an architect employed in
conſiderable works. In 1671 he built Thoreſby-houſe in Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire,
burned a few years ago, Dynham-houſe in Glouceſterſhire
1698, and Chatſworth; the elegance and lightneſs of the latter front
do great honour to the artiſt; the other ſides are not equally beautiful.
The flight of ſteps by which you aſcend from the hall to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
was thought noble enough by Kent to be borrowed for Holkam.
His ſon John Talman reſided much in Italy, and made a large col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of prints and drawings, particularly of churches and altars,
many of which were done by himſelf. Mr. Sadler had many altars
and inſides of churches at Rome, waſhed by him in their proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,

Formed to pleaſe both Auguſtus, and an Egyptian monarch who

               <p>Was brought from Venice in this reign by the duke of Mancheſter,
for whom he painted a ſtaircaſe in Arlington-ſtreet, now deſtroyed.
He performed ſeveral works of this kind, for the duke of Portland
and lord Burlington, a ſalon, ſtaircaſe, and cielings at Caſtle Howard,
the ſtaircaſe at Kimbolton, and a hall at Sir Andrew Fountain's at
Narford in Norfolk. He made ſeveral deſigns for painting the dome
of St. Paul's, and was paid for them, though they were not executed,
and was choſen one of the directors of the academy. He painted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
many ſmall pieces of hiſtory, before he left England <note n="*" place="bottom">When the famous ſyſtem of Mr. Lawes was ſet on foot in France, the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as oſtentatious as their apes, the Southſea-company, purchaſed the Hotel de Nevers, and began to decorate it in the moſt pompous manner. Pelegrini was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited from England to paint the cieling of the principal gallery, and wrote a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his work—all that now remains of it; for the ſyſtem burſt, and the king purchaſing the viſionary palace, it was converted into the Royal Library and Pelegrini's labours demoliſhed. France, the heathen gods, the river of Miſſiſſipi, religion, and all the virtues, and half the vices, as allegoric perſonages, with which the flatterers of the former reign had fatigued the eyes of the public, were here again re-aſſembled; and avarice and prodigality and impoſture were perfumed out of the ſame cenſers with which ambition, and vain-glory, and ſuperſtition had been made drunk before.

He and Pelegrini diſagreeing, Marco went to Venice and
perſuaded his uncle to come over, Sebaſtian Ricci, who had been
Pelegrini's maſter, and who was ſoon preferred to the diſciple.
Ricci's works are ſtill admired, though there is little excellence in
them; his colouring is chalky and without force. He painted the
chapel at Bulſtrode for the duke of Portland, and in the laſt ſupper
has introduced his own portrait in a modern habit. At Burlington-houſe
the hall and ſome cielings are by him, and a piece of ruins in
the manner of Viviano. Ricci and Caſſini, another painter here at
that time <note n="*" place="bottom">Sebaſtian Ricci excelled particularly in imitations of Paul Veroneſe, many of which he ſold for originals; and once even deceived La Foſſe.

               <p>Was born of a genteel family in Hungary; his father, a deputy from
the ſtates of that country to the emperor. The ſon was not brought
up to the profeſſion, but made conſiderable progreſs by the force of
his natural abilities. Fruit, flowers, and eſpecially birds were his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence.
Queen Anne beſpoke ſeveral of his pieces, ſtill in the royal
palaces. He was a man of a gentle and fair character, and lived
between forty and fifty years in England, known at firſt only by the
name of the Hungarian. He had raiſed an eaſy fortune, but being
perſuaded to make it over to his ſon, who was going to marry a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
fortune, who proved no fortune at all, and other misfortunes
ſucceeding, poverty and ſickneſs terminated his life at his houſe in
Great Queen-ſtreet. His pictures and goods were ſold by auction at
his houſe, the ſign of the golden eagle, in Great Queen-ſtreet, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln's-inn-fields.
His ſon is in the board of Ordnance, and formerly
painted in his father's manner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLARET</p>
               <p>Imitated Sir Peter Lely, from whom he made many copies. There is
a print from his picture of John Egerton earl of Bridgwater, done as
early as 1680. Claret died at his houſe in Lincoln's-inn-fields in
1706, and being a widower, made his houſe-keeper his heireſs.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MURRAY</p>
               <p>Painted many portraits. At the Royal-ſociety is a picture of Dr.
Halley by him, and the earl of Halifax had one of Wycherley.
There is a mezzotinto of Murray.

               <p>Better known by Prior's beautiful verſes to him, than by his own
works, was ſon of Ralph Howard doctor of phyſic, and was born in
Dublin Feb. 7, 1675. His father being driven from Ireland by the
troubles that followed the Revolution, brought the lad to England,
who diſcovering a diſpoſition to the arts and Belles Lettres, was ſent
to travel in 1697, and on his way to Italy, paſſed through Holland
in the train of Thomas earl of Pembroke, one of the plenipotentiaries
at the treaty of Ryſwick. Mr. Howard proceeded as he had intended,
and having viſited France and Italy, returned home in October 1700.</p>
               <p>Some years he paſſed in Dublin, but the greateſt and latter part of
his life he ſpent entirely in England, practicing painting, at leaſt with
applauſe; but having ingratiated himſelf by his fame and knowledge
of hands with men of the firſt rank, particularly the duke of Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire
and lord Pembroke, and by a parſimonious management of his
good fortune and of what he received with his wife, he was enabled to
quit the practical part of his profeſſion for the laſt twenty years of his
life, the former peer having obtained for him the poſts of keeper of
the ſtate-papers and pay-maſter of his majeſty's palaces. In this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſituation he amuſed himſelf with forming a large collection of
prints, books and medals, which at his <note n="*" place="bottom">He died in Pall-mall, and was buried at Richmond.</note> death (March 17, 1737)
he bequeathed to his only brother Robert Howard biſhop of Elphin,
who tranſported them to Ireland.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard's picture was drawn by Dahl, very like, and publiſhed
in mezzotinto about a year before his death. Howard himſelf etched,
from a drawing of Carlo Maratti, a head of Padre Reſta, the collector,
with his ſpectacles on, turning over a book of drawings.

                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0853300503:195"/>JAMES PARMENTIER,</p>
               <p>A Frenchman born in 1658, was nephew of Bourdon by whom he
was firſt inſtructed, but his uncle dying, he came to England in 1676,
and was employed at Montagu-houſe by La Foſſe to lay his dead co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
King William ſent Parmentier to his new palace at Loo, but
he quarrelled with Marot, the ſurveyor of the buildings, and returned
to London, where not finding much employment, he went into York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
and worked ſeveral years, both in portrait and hiſtoric paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The altar-piece in a church at Hull, and another in St. Peter's
at Leeds, Moſes receiving the law, much commended by Thoreſby,
are of his hand. His beſt work was the ſtaircaſe at Workſop. To
Painter's- hall he gave the ſtory of Diana and Endymion. On the
death of Laguerre in 1721, he returned to London, in hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to the buſineſs of the latter. He died in indifferent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
Dec. 2, 1730, as he was on the point of going to Amſterdam,
whither he had been invited by ſome relations. He was buried in St.
Paul's Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>JOHN VANDER VAART</p>
               <p>Of Harlem, came to England in 1674, and learned of Wyck the
father, but did not confine himſelf to landſcape. For ſome time he
painted draperies for Wiſſing, and portraits <note n="*" place="bottom">He twice drew his own portrait, at the age of 30, and of 60; and one of Kerſeboom.</note> for himſelf, and ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life.
He was particularly famous for repreſentations of partridges
and dead game. In old Devonſhire-houſe in Piccadilly he painted a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0853300503:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
violin againſt a door, that deceived every body. When the houſe was
burned, this piece was preſerved and is now at Chatſworth. In 1713
he ſold his collection, and got more money by mending pictures than
he did in the former part of his life by painting them. He built a
houſe in Covent-garden of which pariſh he was an inhabitant above
fifty years. He was a man of an amiable character, and dying of a
fever in 1721 at the age of ſeventy-four, was buried in the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
iſle of the church of Covent-garden. Prints were taken from
ſeveral of his works; ſome he executed in mezzotinto himſelf, and
others from Wiſſing; in which art he gave inſtructions to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
John Smith. Vander Vaart, who was a batchelor, left a
nephew, Arnold, who ſucceeded him in the buſineſs of repairing
pictures.</p>
               <p>RHODOLPHUS SHMUTZ</p>
               <p>Was born at Baſil in Swiſſerland, and in 1702 came into England,
where he painted portraits: Vertue ſays, "They were well-coloured,
his draperies pleaſant, and his women gracefull. He died in 1714,
and was buried at Pancras.</p>

               <p>Born at Berlin of French parents, and educated in the academy there,
went for ſome time to Italy, returned to Berlin and from thence came
to England in 1712, where he was much employed in copying pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and making drawings in chalk from Italian maſters for engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
There was a deſign of engraving a ſet of prints from all the

beſt pictures in this country, and Preudhomme went to Wilton with
that view, where, after an irregular life, he died in 1726 at the age
of forty. He had contracted a French ſtyle in his pictures from his
maſter Monſieur Peſne.</p>
               <p>Colonel SEYMOUR,</p>
               <p>Nearly related to the preſent duke of Somerſet and the earl of Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
had ſome fine pictures, and painted in water-colours and cray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
In the latter he copied from Cooper a head of Sir John Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
lieutenant of the Tower. He alſo drew many hiſtoric heads, and
portraits with a pen. He lived in the houſe in Hyde-park at the end
of Kenſington-garden.</p>

                  </gap> BOIT,</p>
               <p>Well-known for his portraits in enamel, in which manner he has
never perhaps been ſurpaſſed but by his predeceſſor Petitot, and his
ſucceſſor Zincke. Before I give an account of him, I muſt premiſe
that I do not anſwer for the truth of ſome parts of his ſtory, which
to me ſeem a little incredible. I give them as I find them in two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
MSS. of Vertue, who names his authors, Peterſon, a ſcholar
of Boit and another perſon. Vertue was incapable of falſhood—per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he was too credulous.</p>
               <p>Boit, whoſe father was a Frenchman, was born at Stockholm, and
bred a jeweller, which profeſſion he intended to follow here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
but changed for painting, but was upon ſo low a foot, that he
went into the country, and taught children to draw. There he had
engaged one of his ſcholars, a gentleman's daughter to marry him,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0853300503:198"/>
but the affair being diſcovered, Boit was thrown <note n="*" place="bottom">An act of tyranny, as the affair was not compleat, nor was there then a marriage-act.</note> into priſon. In
that confinement, which laſted two years, he ſtudied enamelling; an
art to which he fixed on his return to London, and practiced with the
greateſt ſucceſs: Dahl chiefly recommended him. His prices are not
to be believed. For a copy of colonel Seymour's picture by Kneller,
he had thirty guineas; for a lady's head not larger, double that ſum,
and for a few plates 500 <hi>l.</hi> If this appears enormous, what will the
reader think of the following anecdote? He was to paint a large plate
of the queen, prince George, the principal officers and ladies of the
court, and Victory introducing the duke of Marlborough and prince
Eugene; France and Bavaria proſtrate on the ground; ſtandards,
arms, trophies. The ſize of the plate to be from 24 to 22 inches
high, by 16 to 18 inches wide. Laguerre actually painted the deſign
for it in oil. Prince George, who earneſtly patronized the work, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
an advance of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to Boit, who took a ſpot of ground in
May-fair, and erected a furnace, and built convenient rooms adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to work in. He made ſeveral eſſays before he could even lay the
enamelled ground, the heat neceſſary being ſo intenſe that it muſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
as much in a few hours, as furnaces in glaſs-houſes do in 24 hours.
In theſe attempts he waſted ſeven or eight hundred pounds. In the mean
time the prince, who had often viſited the operation, died. This put
a ſtop to the work for ſome time; Boit however began to lay colours
on the plate; but demanded and obtained 700 <hi>l.</hi> more. This made
conſiderable noiſe, during which happened the revolution at court,
extending itſelf even to Boit's work. Their graces of Marlborough
were to be diſplaced even in the enamel, and her majeſty ordered Boit,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0853300503:199"/>
to introduce Peace and Ormond, inſtead of Victory and Churchill.
Theſe alterations were made in the ſketch, which had not been in the
fire, and remained ſo in Peterſon's hands, when he related the ſtory to
Vertue. Prince Eugene refuſed to ſit. The queen died. Boit ran
in debt, his goods were ſeized by execution, and he fled to France;
where he changed his religion, was countenanced by the regent, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a penſion of 250 <hi>l.</hi> per ann. and an apartment, and was much
admired in a country where they had ſeen no enameller ſince Petitot.
Boit died ſuddenly at Paris, about Chriſtmas 1726. Though he never
executed the large piece in queſtion, there is one at Kenſington of a
conſiderable ſize, repreſenting queen Anne ſitting, and prince George
ſtanding by her. At Bedford-houſe is another very large plate of the
duke's father and mother. I have a good copy by him of the Venus,
Cupid, Satyr and Nymphs, by Luca Jordano at Devonſhire-houſe,
and a fine head of admiral Churchill; and miſs Reade, the paintreſs,
has a very fine head of Boit's own daughter, enamelled by him from
a picture of Dahl. This daughter was married to Mr. Graham,
apothecary, in Poland-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>LEWIS CROSSE,</p>
               <p>A painter in water-colours, who is not to be confounded with <note n="*" place="bottom">It is Michael Croſſe, of whom there is an account in Graham.</note> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Croſſe or De La Crux, whom I have mentioned in the reign of
Charles I. Lewis Croſſe painted ſeveral portraits in miniature in
queen Anne's time, many of which are in the collection of the ducheſs
of Portland, the counteſs of Cardigan, &amp;c. This Croſſe repaired a
little picture of the queen of Scots in the poſſeſſion of duke Hamilton,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0853300503:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and was ordered to make it as handſome as he could. It ſeems, a
round face was his idea of perfect beauty, but it happened not to be
Mary's ſort of beauty. However, it was believed a genuine picture,
and innumerable copies were made from it. It is the head in black
velvet trimmed with ermine. Croſſe had a valuable collection of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatures,
the works of Peter Oliver, Hoſkins and Cooper. Among
them was a fine picture of a lady Sunderland by the latter, his own
wife, and a head almoſt profile in crayons of Hoſkins; a great curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
as I neither know of any other portrait of that maſter, nor where
the picture itſelf is now. That collection was ſold at his houſe the
ſign of the blue anchor in Henrietta-ſtreet Covent-garden Dec. 5,
1722, and Croſſe died in October 1724.</p>
               <p>Statuary in this reign, and for ſome years afterwards, was in a
manner monopolized by</p>
               <p>FRANCIS BIRD.</p>
               <p>The many public works by his hand, which inſpire nobody with a
curioſity of knowing the artiſt, are not good teſtimonies in his favour.
He was born in Piccadilly 1667, and ſent at eleven years of age to
Bruſſels, where he learned the rudiments of his art from one Cozins,
who had been in England. From Flanders he went to Rome, and
ſtudied under Le Gros. At nineteen, ſcarce remembring his own
language, he came home, and worked firſt for Gibbons, then for Cib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
He took <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe two journies, it is ſaid, he performed on foot.</note> another ſhort journey to Italy, and at his return ſet up
for himſelf. The performance that raiſed his reputation, was the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0853300503:201"/>
monument of Buſby. The latter had never permitted his picture to
be drawn. The moment he was dead, his friends had a caſt in plaiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
taken from his face, and thence a drawing in crayons, from which
White engraved his print, and Bird carved his image. His other
principal works, which are all I find of his hiſtory, were,</p>
               <p>The converſion of St. Paul in the pediment of that cathedral. Any
ſtatuary was good enough for an ornament of that height, and a great
ſtatuary had been too good.</p>
               <p>The baſ-reliefs under the portico.</p>
               <p>The ſtatue of queen Anne, and the four figures round the pedeſtal,
before the ſame church. The author of the Abregè, ſpeaking of
Engliſh artiſts, ſays, "à l'egard de la ſculpture, le marbre gemit pour
ainſi dire, ſous des ciſeaux auſſi peu habiles que ceux qui ont executé
le groupe de la reine Anne, placè devant l'Egliſe de St. Paul, &amp; les
tombeaux de l'Abbaye de Weſtminſter." This author had not ſeen
the works of Ryſbrach and Roubiliac; and for the ſatire on the groupe
of queen Anne, we may pardon the ſculptor who occaſioned it, as it
gave riſe to another ſatire, thoſe admirable lines of Dr. Garth.</p>
               <p>The ſtatue of cardinal Wolſey at Chriſt-church.</p>
               <p>The brazen figure of Henry VI. at Eton-college—a wretched
performance indeed!</p>
               <p>A magnificent monument in Fulham-church for the lord viſcount
Mordaunt. Bird received 250<hi>l.</hi> for his part of the ſculpture.</p>
               <p>The ſumptuous monument of the laſt duke of Newcaſtle in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-abbey,
erected by the counteſs of Oxford, his daughter. The
cumbent figure is not the worſt of Bird's works.</p>
               <p>At lord Oxford's auction was ſold his copy of the faun.
Bird died in 1731, aged 64.

he broke through all rule and compenſated for it by no imagination.
He ſeems to have hollowed quarries rather than to have built houſes;
and ſhould his edifices, as they ſeem formed to do, out-laſt all record,

If Vanbrugh had borrowed from Vitruvius as happily as from
Dancour, Inigo Jones <note n="*" place="bottom">Inigo Jones imitated the taſte of the antique, but did not copy it ſo ſervilely as Palladio. Lord Burlington, who had exquiſite taſte, was a little too fearful of deviating from his models. Raphael, Michael Angelo, Vignola, Bernini, and the beſt Italian architects, have dare to invent, when it was in the ſpirit of the ſtandard. Perhaps there could not be a more beautiful work, than a volume collected and engraved from the buildings and hints of buildings in the pictures of Raphael, Albano, Pietrò Cortona, and Nicolò Pouſſin. It is ſurprizing that Raphael's works in this manner have not been aſſembled. Beſides thoughts in his paintings, he executed ſeveral real buildings of the trueſt delicacy.</note> would not be the firſt architect of Britain.</p>
               <p>Sir John Vanbrugh died at Whitehall March 26, 1726. In his

            <head type="sub">The following ſlight notices relating to artiſts who have
worked for the Engliſh but came not to England, or
who are curſorily mentioned to have been here, are
extracted from Deſcamps.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HUBERT JACOBS,</hi> of Delft, painted portraits of ſeveral
Engliſh; and it is pretended that to ſatisfy their natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
he formed a haſty manner that prejudiced his works and
reputation. Vol. ii. p. 36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John David de Heem,</hi> of Utrecht, a celebrated painter of flowers,
had ſold a capital piece to Vander Meer, another painter, for 2000
florins. Vander Meer being plundered by ſome troops, had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource
but in preſenting that curioſity to king William, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
the monarch's head in the garland. The king brought it to
England, having beſtowed a lucrative employment on the donor.
Vol. ii. p. 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry Pot,</hi> of Harlem, drew the portraits of the king and queen
of England, and of the principal nobility—at what time is not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified—probably
they were Charles II, and his mother, &amp;c. during
their exile. Ib. 43.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0853300503:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>John Lievens,</hi> born at Leyden in 1607, was an admired painter of
portraits. The prince of Orange preſented to the Engliſh embaſſador
(who gave it to the king) the picture of a ſtudent ſitting by the fire,
which pleaſed ſo much that Lievens came to England on the credit of
it, drew moſt of the royal family and many of the nobility, though
then but 24, (it was in 1630) and ſtaid here three years. This is all
the account I find of this painter in England, nor do I know any of
his works here; yet the tradition is confirmed by a MS. catalogue of
king Charles's pictures, in which are named, the ſtudent; portraits
of the prince and princeſs; and a ſalutation of the virgin. Deſcamps,
vol. ii. p. 117.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Palamedes Stevens,</hi> according to Deſcamps, is ſtill more our own,
having been born at London in 1607, though he never practiced
here. His father, an eminent ſculptor of Delft, was celebrated for
carving vaſes in porphyry, agate, jaſper, and other precious materials,
and was invited to England by James I, where the ſon was born,
ſoon after which he was carried by his father to Holland, and died at
the age of 31. Ib. p. 118.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicholas de Heltſtokade,</hi> of Nimeguen, painted the king of England.
I ſuppoſe, Charles II. Ib. p. 112.</p>
            <p>The directors of the Dutch Eaſt-india-company gave 4000 florins
for a picture of Gerard Dow, repreſenting a woman with an infant
on her lap, playing with a little girl; they preſented it to Charles II.
on his reſtoration; king William carried it back to Loo. Ib. 221.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giles Schagen,</hi> of Alcmaer, was a great copyiſt, and painted por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits
and ſea-pieces. He was born in 1616, and Deſcamps ſays, he
was in England. Ib. 253.</p>
            <p>King William gave 900 florins for a picture by <hi>Mary Van Ooſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0853300503:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>John Henry Roos,</hi> born at Otterburg in the lower Palatinate in 1631,
was a painter of landſcape and animals, and, according to Deſcamps,
came into England; but probably ſtaid here very little time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Sckellinks,</hi> according to the foregoing authority, was here
too, but ſtaid as little. He painted in Holland the embarkation of
Charles II, at the reſtoration, which was reckoned his capital work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John de Baan,</hi> born at Harlem 1633, became ſo conſiderable a
portrait-painter that on his arrival in England, Lely, who if Deſcamps
were to be credited, was the moſt jealous of his profeſſion, (which is
a paſſion more likely to be felt by the worſt artiſts than by the beſt)
was exceedingly glad that De Baan returned ſoon to the Hague. He
frequently drew king William and queen Mary, and painted king
James in his paſſage through Holland. John de Baan died in 1702.</p>
            <p>That neat and curious painter <hi>Vander Heyden</hi> was probably in
England, for Deſcamps (vol. iii. p. 49.) mentions a view of the
Royal-exchange by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franciſco Milè</hi> was here, but made no ſtay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert du Val,</hi> who had been employed by king William at Loo,
was ſent over to clean the Cartoons, and place them in Hampton-court.
See his Life in Deſcamps, vol. iii. p. 172.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Van Hugtenburch,</hi> of Harlem, was employed by prince Eugene
to paint his battles, and had a ſhare in the deſigns for the triumphal
tapeſtry at Blenheim.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſtine Terweſten,</hi> of the Hague, born in 1649, viſited England
in the courſe of his ſtudies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Vander Spriet,</hi> of Delft, painter of portraits, died at London.
He is quite unknown. V. Deſcamps, vol. iii. p. 261.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simon Vander Does,</hi> ſtaid here but a very ſhort time.</p>
