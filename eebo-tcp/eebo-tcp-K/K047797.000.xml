            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE promiſcuous collection of queſtions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Arithmetic, was intended for the exerciſe of pupils after they had gone through the ſeveral rules of the book, and has been found very uſeful to them, by accuſtoming them to think, and to ſtrike out methods of ſolution unaſſiſted by other helps. But many gentlemen having expreſſed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have a publication of the ſolutions of thoſe queſtions at full length, that they might have the ſatisfaction to compare their own ſolutions with thoſe of the Author, and thereby the opportunity of chuſing which they like beſt, he has herein complied with their requeſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſolutions are publiſhed apart from the work itſelf, that the teacher may avail himſelf of them, and yet keep them from the ſight of his pupils if he ſo chuſes, each learner having only the book of arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic for the purpoſes therein mentioned.</p>
            <p>The ſolutions are all delivered in what have been judged to be the beſt forms. Sometimes two me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods are given, where they ſeemed neceſſary. In ſuch of them as contain any proportions, or rule-of-three ſtatings, the fourth term is generally put down in the form of a vulgar fraction, placing the product of the ſecond and third terms, as numerator, to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0030700600:3"/>divided by the firſt as a denominator; the fraction is then abbreviated as much as it can be, before the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication and diviſion are performed; by which means generally theſe two operations are intirely ſaved, or at leaſt much ſhortened and facilitated, by bringing them to ſuch ſmall numbers as can be eaſily multiplied and divided mentally, and the anſwer thence diſcovered without any other intermediate fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures or operations to be written down. So that there is never occaſion for more writing than appears in the operations as here printed, where it will be found that, to avoid the long form of diviſion, the large diviſors are ſeparated into their component parts, and the diviſions performed ſeparately by them, which are always done by writing down only the quotients. But where the numbers are ſo large as to make long diviſions, or multiplications, unavoidable, thoſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are always placed down at the bottom of the ſolution, that ſo none of the neceſſary part of the writing in the full ſolution, might be omitted.</p>

                  <p>But the damaged part ſold at 5s. <hi>per</hi> yard, therefore as 5s. or ¼l. ∶ 116⅔l. ∷ 1 yd. ∶ 116⅔ × 4=466⅔ yards, the quantity which was damaged. And the double of it, or 933⅓ yards was the undamaged part, which muſt ſell for 433⅓l. Therefore as 933⅓ ∶ 1 ∷ 433⅓ ∶ 433⅓ / 933⅓ = (by multiplying the terms both by 3) 1300/2800=13/28l. the price <hi>per</hi> yard.</p>

                  <p>OTHERWISE.</p>
                  <p>Since the ſound part is the double of the part damaged, and the former muſt gain a ſum juſt the double of that which was loſt by the latter, it is evident that <hi>it</hi> muſt be ſold at a rate as much above the prime coſt, as the other was below it.</p>
                  <p>Now the loſs on ⅓ part was 50l. at which rate the whole 500 would have brought only 350; therefore as 350 ∶ 500, or as 7 ∶ 10 ∷ 5s. ∶ 50/7=7 1/7s. the prime coſt per yard.</p>
                  <p>Hence 7 1/7 − 5=2 1/7=the loſs <hi>per</hi> yard on the damaged part, and 7 1/7 + 2 1/7=9 2/7s. the price <hi>per</hi> yard of the ſound part.</p>
