            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT muſt not be diſſembled that there are many real diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in the Chriſtian ſcriptures; whilſt at the ſame time
more, I believe, and greater may juſtly be imputed to certain
maxims of interpretation, which have obtained authority
without reaſon, and are received without enquiry.—One of
theſe, as I apprehend, is the expecting to find in the preſent
circumſtances of chriſtianity, a meaning for, or ſomething
anſwering to, every appellation and expreſſion which occurs
in ſcripture; or in other words, the applying to the perſonal
condition of Chriſtians at this day, thoſe titles, phraſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
and arguments, which belong ſolely to the ſituation
of chriſtianity at its firſt inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0210201600:4"/>
I am aware of an objection which weighs much with many
ſerious tempers, namely, that to ſuppoſe any part of ſcripture
to be inapplicable to us, is to ſuppoſe a part of ſcripture to be
uſeleſs; which ſeems to detract from the perfection we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to theſe oracles of our ſalvation.—To this I can only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that it would have been one of the ſtrangeſt things in
the world, if the writings of the new teſtament had not, like
all other books, been compoſed for the apprehenſion, and
conſequently adapted to the circumſtances, of the perſons they
were addreſſed to; and that it would have been equally ſtrange,
if the great, and in many reſpects the inevitable, alterations,
which have taken place in thoſe circumſtances, did not vary
the application of ſcripture language.</p>
            <p>I deſign in the following diſcourſe to propoſe ſome examples
of this variation, from which you will judge, as I proceed, of
the truth and importance of our general obſervation.</p>
            <p>1. At the time the ſcriptures were written, none were <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi>
but converts, and none were converted but from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
and conviction produced for the moſt part a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding
reformation of life and manners.—Hence <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
was only another name for converſion, and converſion was
ſuppoſed to be ſincere—in this ſenſe was our Savior's promiſe,
"<note n="a" place="bottom">Mark xvi. 16.</note> he that believeth and is <hi>baptized</hi> ſhall be ſaved," and in the
ſame his command to St. Paul "<note n="b" place="bottom">Acts xxii. 16.</note> ariſe and be <hi>baptized</hi> and
waſh away thy ſins;" this was that <hi>baptiſm</hi> "for the remiſſion
of ſins," to which St. Peter<note n="c" place="bottom">Acts ii, 38,</note> invited the Jews upon the day of
Pentecoſt; that "<hi>waſhing</hi> of regeneration" by which as St. Paul<note n="d" place="bottom">Titus iii. 5.</note> writes to Titus "he ſaved us." Now when we come
to ſpeak of the <hi>baptiſm</hi> which obtains in moſt chriſtian
churches at preſent, where no converſion is ſuppoſed, or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0210201600:5"/>
poſſible; it is manifeſt, that if theſe expreſſions be applied at
all, they muſt be applied with extreme qualification and
reſerve.</p>
            <p>2. The community of chriſtians were at firſt a handful of
men connected amongſt themſelves by the ſtricteſt union, and
divided from the reſt of the world by a real difference of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
and perſuaſion, and what was more obſervable, by many
outward peculiarities of worſhip and behavior.—This
ſociety conſidered collectively, and as a <hi>body,</hi> were ſet apart
from the reſt of mankind for a more gracious diſpenſation, as
well as actually diſtinguiſhed by a ſuperior purity of life and
converſation.—In this view, and in oppoſition to the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
world, they were denominated in ſcripture by titles of
great ſeeming dignity and import—they were "<note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 33. i. 6, 7.</note> elect,"
"called," "faints"—they were "<note n="b" place="bottom">viii. 1.</note> in Chriſt"—they were
"<note n="c" place="bottom">1 Pet. ii. 9.</note> a choſen generation, a royal prieſthood, a holy nation, a
"peculiar people."—That is, theſe terms were employed to
diſtinguiſh the profeſſors of chriſtianity from the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
in the ſame manner as the names of Greek and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
Jew and Gentile, diſtinguiſhed the people of Greece and
Iſrael from other nations. The application of ſuch phraſes
to the whole <hi>body</hi> of chriſtians is become now obſcure; partly,
becauſe it is not eaſy to conceive of chriſtians as a <hi>body</hi> at all,
by reaſon of the extent of their name and numbers, and the
little viſible union that ſubſiſts among them; and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the heathen world with whom they were compared, and
to which compariſon theſe phraſes relate, is now ceaſed, or is
removed from our obſervation.—Suppoſing therefore theſe
expreſſions to have a perpetual meaning, and either forgetting
the original uſe of them, or finding <hi>that,</hi> at this time, in a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0210201600:6"/>
great meaſure exhauſted and inſignificant, we reſort to a ſenſe
and an application of them, eaſier it may be to our compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
but extremely foreign from the deſign of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
namely, to diſtinguiſh individuals amongſt us, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of Chriſtianity from one another—agreeably to which
Idea the moſt flattering of theſe names, the "elect," "called,"
"ſaints," have by bold and unlearned men been appropriated
to themſelves and their own party with a preſumption and
conceit, injurious to the reputation of our religion amongſt
"them that are without," and extremely diſguſting to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
part of its profeſſors: whereas, that ſuch titles were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in a ſenſe common to all chriſtian converts is well
argued from many places in which they occur, in which places
you may plainly ſubſtitute the terms <hi>convert</hi> or <hi>converted</hi> for
the ſtrongeſt of theſe phraſes without any alteration of the
author's meaning, e. g. "<note n="a" place="bottom">1 Cor. vi. 1.</note> dare any of you go to Law before
the unjuſt and not before the ſaints?" "<note n="b" place="bottom">vii. 18.</note> is any man <hi>called</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
circumciſed, let him not become uncircumciſed?"—"<note n="c" place="bottom">1 Pet. v. 13.</note> the
church that is at Babylon <hi>elected</hi> together with you ſaluteth
you"—"<note n="d" place="bottom">Rom. xvi. 7.</note> ſalute Andronicus and Junia who were <hi>in Chriſt</hi>
before me."</p>
            <p>3. In oppoſition to the Jews who were ſo much offended
by the preaching of the Goſpel to the Gentiles, St. Paul main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
with great induſtry, that it was God Almighty's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from <hi>the firſt</hi> to ſubſtitute at a fit ſeaſon into the place of
the rejected Iſraelites a ſociety of men, taken indifferently out
of all nations under heaven, and admitted to be the people of
God upon eaſier and more comprehenſive terms—this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, as follows;"<note n="e" place="bottom">Eph. i. 9, 10. alſo ſee Eph. iii. 5, 6.</note> having
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0210201600:7"/>
made known to us the myſtery of his will, according to his
good pleaſure which he hath <hi>purpoſed in himſelf,</hi> that in the
diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together
in one all things in Chriſt."—The ſcheme of collecting ſuch
a ſociety was what God <hi>foreknow</hi> before the foundation of the
world; was what he did <hi>predeſtinate;</hi> was the <hi>eternal purpoſe</hi>
which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus: and by conſequence this
ſociety in their collective capacity were the objects of this <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
predeſtination,</hi> and <hi>purpoſe;</hi> that is, in the language
of the apoſtles, they were they "<note n="a" place="bottom">Rom, viii. 29.</note> whom he did <hi>foreknow,</hi>" they
"whom he did <hi>predeſtinate</hi>"—they were "<note n="b" place="bottom">Eph, i. 4.</note> 
               <hi>choſen in Chriſt</hi>
before the foundation of the world"—they were "<note n="c" place="bottom">1 Pet. i, 2.</note> 
               <hi>elect</hi>
according to the <hi>foreknowledge</hi> of God the Father." This doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
has nothing in it harſh or obſcure.—But what have we
made of it?—The rejection of the Jews, and the adopting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
community into their place, compoſed, whilſt it was
carrying on, an object of great magnitude in the attention of
the inſpired writers who underſtood and obſerved it.—This
event, which engaged ſo much the thoughts of the Apoſtle, is
now only read of, and hardly that—the reality and the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it are little known or attended to.—Loſing ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the proper occaſion of theſe expreſſions, yet willing
after our faſhion to adapt them to ourſelves, and finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe in our circumſtances that ſuited with them, we have
learnt at length to apply them to the final deſtiny of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
at the day of judgement; and upon this foundation has
been erected a doctrine which lays the ax at once to the root
of all religion, that of an abſolute appointment to ſalvation or
perdition, independent of ourſelves or any thing we can do:
and, what is extraordinary, thoſe very arguments and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0210201600:8"/>
(Rom. Chap. ix. x. xi.) which the Apoſtle employed
to vindicate the impartial mercies of God, againſt the narrow
and excluding claims of Jewiſh prejudice, have been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
to eſtabliſh a diſpenſation the moſt arbitrary and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
that could be deviſed.</p>
            <p>4. The converſion of a grown perſon from heatheniſm to
chriſtianity, which is the caſe of converſion commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in the epiſtles, was a change of which we have now no
juſt conception—it was a new name, a new language, a new
ſociety; a new faith, a new hope; a new object of worſhip,
a new rule of life; a hiſtory was diſcloſed full of diſcovery and
ſurpriſe; a proſpect of futurity was unfolded, beyond imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
awful and auguſt; the ſame deſcription applies in a
great part though not entirely to the converſion of a Jew.—
This, accompanied as it was with the pardon of every former
ſin, (Romans iii. 25.) was ſuch an aera in a man's life, ſo
remarkable a period in his recollection, ſuch a revolution of
every thing that was moſt important to him, as might well
admit of thoſe ſtrong figures and ſignificant alluſions by which
it is deſcribed in ſcripture—it was a "<note n="a" place="bottom">Tit. iii. 5.</note> 
               <hi>regeneration,</hi>" or a
new birth—it was to be "<note n="b" place="bottom">John i. 13. iii. 5.</note> born again of God and of the
ſpirit"—it was to be "<note n="c" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 2, 13.</note> dead to ſin," and" alive from the
dead"—it was to be "<note n="d" place="bottom">Col. ii. 12.</note> buried with Chriſt in baptiſm, and
raiſed together with him"—it was "<note n="e" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 17.</note> a new creature" and
"<note n="f" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 24.</note> a new creation"—it was a tranſlation from the condition
of "<note n="g" place="bottom">Gal. iv. 7.</note> ſlaves to that of ſons"—from "<note n="h" place="bottom">Eph. ii, 19.</note> ſtrangers and foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to be fellow citizens with the ſaints and of the houſhold of
God." It is manifeſt that no change equal or ſimilar to the
converſion of a heathen can be experienced by us, or by any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0210201600:9"/>
one educated in a chriſtian country, and to whom the facts,
precepts and hopes of chriſtianity have been from his infancy
familiar—yet we will retain the ſame language—and what
has been the conſequence? One ſort of men, obſerving nothing
in the lives of chriſtians, correſponding to the magnificence,
if I may ſo ſay, of theſe expreſſions, have been tempted to
conclude, that the expreſſions themſelves had no foundation
in truth and nature, or in any thing but the enthuſiaſm of
their authors.—Others again underſtand theſe phraſes to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
nothing more, than that gradual amendment of life and
converſation, which reaſon and religion ſometimes produce in
particular chriſtians—of which interpretation it is truly ſaid,
that it degrades too much the proper force of language, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
expreſſions of ſuch energy and import to an event, ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in its own nature, and which is common to chriſtianity
with every other moral inſtitution. Laſtly, a third ſort, in
order to ſatisfy theſe expreſſions to their full extent, have
imagined to themſelves certain perceptible impulſes of the
Holy Ghoſt, by which, in an inſtant, and in a manner, no
doubt, ſufficiently extraordinary, they are "<hi>regenerate</hi> and <hi>born
of the ſpirit</hi>"—they become "<hi>new creatures</hi>"—they are made
the "<hi>ſons of God</hi>" who were before the "<hi>children of wrath</hi>"—
they are "<hi>freed,</hi> from ſin," and "from death"—they are
choſen, that is, and ſealed, without a poſſibility of fall, unto
final ſalvation.—Whilſt the patrons of a more ſober expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
have been often challenged, and ſometimes confounded
with the queſtion—if ſuch expreſſions of ſcripture do not
mean <hi>this,</hi> what do they mean? To which we anſwer—no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
—nothing, that is, to us—nothing to be found, or
ſought for, in the preſent circumſtances of chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>

More examples might be produced, in which the unwary
uſe of ſcripture language has been the occaſion of difficulties
and miſtakes—but I forbear—the preſent are ſufficient to
ſhow, that it behoves every one, who undertakes to explain
the ſcriptures, before he determine to whom or what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is now a days to be applied, to conſider diligently
whether it admit of any ſuch application at all; or whether
it is not rather to be reſtrained to the preciſe circumſtances
and occaſion for which it was originally compoſed.</p>
            <p>I make no apology for addreſſing this ſubject to this audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
becauſe whatever relates to the interpretation of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
relates, as I conceive, to us; for, if, by any light we may
caſt upon theſe ancient books, we can enable and invite the
people to read the Bible for themſelves, we diſcharge in my
judgement the firſt duty of our function—ever bearing in
mind that we are the miniſters not of our own ſame or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
but of the ſincere Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
