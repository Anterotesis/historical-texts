            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE <hi>PREFACE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THERE is no Perſon more Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the Man who makes himſelf greatly Eminent. It is a ſort of tacit Reproach on the reſt of the Species: and every one feels his own meanneſs the more ſenſibly, when he looks toward thoſe exalted Genius's, who have gain'd a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over the reſt of mankind. This may make it obvious to imagine, that the following Dialogues are partly deſign'd as Invectives; and produc'd chiefly from that Blind-ſide in Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, which makes Men willing to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rogate from every one, who has <hi>merit</hi> enough, to provoke; and <hi>fame</hi> enough, to make others think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves leſſen'd by the overgrowth of his Character.</p>
            <p>Tho' this reaſoning be exceedingly true in general, it ought to be conſider'd
<pb facs="tcp:0128700300:3"/>
at the ſame time, that any diſlike to the Eminence of others na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ariſes, only among ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as are got into the ſame paths of Fame. The Gentlemen of the Sword cannot bear to have others riſe over their head; the Men of Genius look maliciouſly on a prevailing Poet: But <hi>Pope,</hi> I preſume, never envied <hi>Marlborough</hi> the Battle of <hi>Blenheim,</hi> any more than that Hero envied him his Tranſlation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Give me leave to ſay farther, that in reading that Work of his, which occaſion'd this Eſſay, no one cou'd be more delighted, than I was, in ſeveral parts of it. Many Beauties I ſaw in it; and I imagin'd I ſaw ſome
<pb facs="tcp:0128700300:4"/>
Faults: In ſome particular Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this Head, I have found my ſelf indifferent in the Caſe: and now I have here flung the Thoughts on both together, I hope, with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Impartiality. But if ſome things ſhou'd be blamed without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reaſon, or others commended too highly, and in a manner diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to what they deſerve, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit each to the many better judges, who may happen to meet with theſe ſheets. I ask pardon for any Errors in them: I beg to be ſet right.</p>
            <p>Prefaces, I think, are the only pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which a Man may be allow'd to talk freely of that worſt of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>Himſelf:</hi> I hope no body will deny one the uſe of ſo <hi>aukward a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege;</hi> and ſhall therefore go on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther Apologies.</p>
            <p>To many it may perhaps ſeem ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant to find fault at all with ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd and ſo noble a Poet as Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi> Indeed here are ſome things propoſed as faulty from his Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but they are only propoſed: the
<pb facs="tcp:0128700300:5"/>
World is to judge of them. Where I have been miſtaken in any of theſe Points, it is not for want of a due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the merits of this Writer; but from the ſhortneſs of my own ſight. On the contrary, if any ſuch Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms happen ſometimes to be right, the Eminence of the Poet will be ſo far from being a reaſon againſt them, that it makes any true Cautions the more proper, and in ſome ſenſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Beſides: The learned World, as I take it, have ever allow'd a Liberty of thinking and of ſpeaking one's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents. That <hi>ſerene Republick</hi> knows none of the diſtance and diſtinctions which cuſtom has introduced into all others. There is a decent familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be admitted between the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the Meaneſt Perſon in it. This has often raiſed a Thought in me, which has ſomething wild and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when indulged to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: 'Tis in Relation to the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar happineſs of Men of Letters; in that they can ſit down in their cloſets
<pb facs="tcp:0128700300:6"/>
and converſe with the greateſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of every Age, or of any Nation; and that in as much freedom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy, as their neareſt Friends cou'd ever uſe toward any of them, when living. What an illuſtrious Aſſembly is there on thoſe Shelves? The Courts of <hi>Auguſtus, Lewis</hi> the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, or <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, never beheld ſuch a frequency of great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's, as ſtand round a Man in his own private Study. How large an Happineſs is it for a Perſon to have it in his Power to ſay at any time, That he is going to ſpend the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon with the moſt agreeable and moſt improving Company, he will chuſe out of all Ages? If he is in a gay Humour, perhaps with <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Anacreon,</hi> and L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Dorſet;</hi> or if more ſolid, either with <hi>Plato,</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> or Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis this eaſe of acceſs, 'tis the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ariſing from it, which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and preſerves the felicity of the <hi>Republick</hi> of Letters. The meaner ſort, which compoſe it, are all Freevoters;
<pb facs="tcp:0128700300:7"/>
and may ſpeak their real Opinion without reſerve: at the ſame time the Characters too, even of the greateſt and firſt Men in it, muſt be form'd and eſtabliſh'd on this open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judging, and that freedom of Obſervation.</p>
            <p>But waving whatever has been ſaid of this Liberty in the Learned World, moſt people will be apt to help one to an Excuſe of another kind: for moſt, I think, are very ready to agree, that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> is only the Maſter-hand in this Tranſlation; and that he has been obliged with the aſſiſtance of ſome other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in ſeveral parts of it. Tho', I believe, I am acquainted with this affair more than many who ſpeak of it with a great deal of Confidence and Aſſurance, any mention of it in the Piece is purpoſely avoided. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has recommended the whole with his Name; He gives the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtroke to every thing: and the Dialogues ſpeak of him, as if he were really the Author of the whole. It
<pb facs="tcp:0128700300:8"/>
wou'd have been a confuſed thing, and often not practicable, to have ſpoken at every turn to the right Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This has occaſion'd ſeveral ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of the Poet, which may ſeem too high for a ſtranger: But as I have ſince had the greateſt reaſon to be perſwaded, that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> is not the ſole Tranſlator; I have at the ſame time equal reaſon to think, that the other Gentlemen engaged are perſons of eſtabliſh'd Characters in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ick World.—After this, perhaps, thoſe Compliments may ſtill be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to ſtand, as they are: I hope they are never wrought too high for Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf; and I believe they may generally be ſpoken very juſtly of his <hi>Seconds</hi> in the Work.</p>
            <p>One word more, and I have done. As to the manner of theſe Dialogues; 'Tis the old <hi>Platonick</hi> way, which <hi>Cicero</hi> brought from <hi>Greece,</hi> and uſed ſo happily in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. It has had its Succeſſes too among the Moderns: <hi>Fontenelle</hi> will always be read with the greateſt Pleaſure, where
<pb facs="tcp:0128700300:9"/>
he has follow'd it; That Writer is peculiarly happy in all his Dialogues, of whatever ſort; and, in general, may be ſaid <hi>to talk as well with Pen and Ink,</hi> as any Man in the World. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it among us by their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Indeed the method it ſelf is more capable of variety, and (which makes it particularly proper for the preſent Caſe) it hath ſomething of Action and Reality in it. Beſides that the common way among us of merely keeping up a Diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two blind Names, is perhaps not very Commendable: the Perſons of the Dialogue in ſuch Caſes are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally like thoſe Actors, who have no Character in the Play; and who only come in <hi>to talk</hi> upon the Stage. They have no more diſtinction, no other marks by which you may know one from another, than the two <hi>Capital Letters,</hi> which uſually ſtand for them. It is much otherwiſe, and and much better, among the Perſons introduced by the Writers in the other
<pb facs="tcp:0128700300:10"/>
method: their Great Names I uſe only to authorize this <hi>manner</hi> of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, as that is all which I can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to imitate in them.</p>
            <p>As I ought to beg pardon of the Reader, for troubling him with ſo long a Preface; I ſhall at the ſame time take the opportunity of begging Pardon of <hi>Antiphaus</hi> and <hi>Philypſus,</hi> (the two Gentlemen who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed under the Perſons of theſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues) for giving to the World, what was chiefly their Thoughts, in a manner ſo much inferiour to what either of them might have done them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I wiſh I might have leave to mention their real Names in this place: That would add a weight to every thing they ſay. Tho' indeed the Sentiments of thoſe Gentlemen, were they fully repreſented, would not want the luſtre of any Authorities to ſet them off; except that of the the Reaſonableneſs with which they both <hi>think</hi> and <hi>ſpeak;</hi> and for both which they have made themſelves ſo remarkable in the World.</p>

The enlarged Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of <hi>Philypſus</hi> always led him to dwell upon the moſt beautified Parts of a Poem with the greateſt Pleaſure; while <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaüs,</hi> who has a very clear Head, and has given much into a ſtrict way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is taken moſt with juſt Deſcriptions, and plain natural Ideas: The one was ſo poſſeſt with the Pleaſure which he felt from fine Thoughts and warm Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that He did not take a full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in low Beauty, and ſimple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of Nature; the other, on the contrary, had ſuch an averſion to <hi>glitterings</hi> and <hi>elevation,</hi> that he was diſtaſted at any the leaſt appearance of either. If the latter was prejudiced for the Ancients, from the Purity and Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which we find in moſt of their Works; <hi>Philypſus</hi> had his <hi>foible</hi> too, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0128700300:13"/>
was ſometimes caught by the Flouriſh and Colouring of the Moderns. In a word, if <hi>Philypſus</hi> wou'd ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn a Point as low and mean, tho' in reality proper enough, and naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd; <hi>Antiphaus,</hi> in his turn, might happen now and then to blame a Paſſage which requir'd a good degree of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being too glaring and artificial.</p>
                  <p>Among ſeveral other Topicks, one Evening, they happen'd to fall into a diſcourſe on Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s new Tranſlation of the <hi>Odyſſey.</hi> As they both found Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in that Piece agreeable to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Taſtes, they had read it over with a great deal of Pleaſure: however <hi>Philypſus</hi> was the Perſon who admired it the moſt. "There are ſome Lines, ſays he to <hi>Antiphaus</hi> (pointing to the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> which lay before them) there are ſome Favourites of mine in that Poem, which you muſt not look upon with your uſual ſeverity: Prithee <hi>Antiphaus,</hi> be more ſenſible to the Flame and Spirit of a Writer, who is evidently Our preſent <hi>Laureate in Genius,</hi> and the moſt enliven'd Tranſlator of the Age. "I will very readily allow what you ſay of that Great Man, return'd <hi>Antiphaus;</hi> and ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pay a deference to your more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taſte of the Fine and Sublime in Poetry;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0128700300:14"/>
but you muſt give me leave to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from you in ſome Particulars: if I do not agree with your Sentiments, in relation to ſeveral Lines and Paſſages of that Tranſlation, 'tis perhaps becauſe I fall ſo much ſhort of you, in your <hi>inward ſenſe</hi> of the high and elevated Beauties of Language. As I cannot imagine that to be the reaſon, ſays <hi>Philypſus,</hi> I beg to hear thoſe Particulars you talk'd of; I am perſwaded, ſeveral of the Paſſages, which I have obſerv'd you to be leſs taken with in reading the Tranſlation, will upon a cloſer view appear to be really Beauties; to tell you the truth, I long to make a Convert of you; and beg you wou'd be full and large in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating whatever Remarks you have made on this Performance. The Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are long; we have ſufficient time upon our Hands; and I know not how we can paſs it away more agreeably.</p>

You will allow me, I believe, in the firſt place, That Lines very good in themſelves, may be bad when conſider'd as a Tranſlation. The aim of a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator is to give us the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; and where the Original is juſt, the very <hi>manner</hi> is to be obſerv'd. By the Manner, I would not intend the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words, or the meer turn of a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od; but that the Imitation ought to be eaſy, ſimple, and unadorn'd, wherever the firſt Writer uſes either of thoſe Styles with Judgment. You are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that plain humble manner of <hi>Homer,</hi> which is more particularly kept up by him in the <hi>Odyſſey:</hi> And as much as I admire ſeveral parts in this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, I cannot but think there are places in it, which differ from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Homer,</hi> without ſufficient reaſon for a Change. The Poet, in ſeveral parts of that Work, ſeems to me to have let fall ſome Lines that are forc'd; ſome of too much flouriſh, and ornament; and a few, even ſwelling, and unnatural; where the Original is with good reaſon plain, and natural, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd unadorn'd.</p>
                  <p>Where we admire the Simplicity of <hi>Homer</hi> with Juſtice, we cannot avoid blaming the want of it in his Tranſlator. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> intimates in one of his <note n="a" place="bottom">B. 14. 1.</note> Notes,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0128700300:16"/>
                     <hi>That</hi> no Reproach has ever fall'n up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Homer,</hi> in relation to his ſinking too Low, or being too Familiar; That as to theſe Particulars he preſerves an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Juſtneſs: and that there is not any one place in his Poem, which can be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cenſur'd upon this account. If ſo, a Tranſlator of <hi>Homer</hi> has no occaſion for raiſing any thing, beyond what it is in the Original; If he follows his Maſter it is ſufficient: All additional Flouriſh and Glitterings, where we ſhould meet with the plain and the familiar, are at beſt ſo many beautiful Excreſcencies.</p>
                  <p>There is one Caſe, which ſeems more particularly to lead Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> into a gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Stile: 'tis almoſt ever to be found in his Deſcriptions of <hi>Day,</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and of the <hi>Morning.</hi> 'Tis true, theſe are ſubjects which in themſelves may require ſome brightneſs in the language; but there is a great difference between giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Light, and dazling ones Eyes. Beſide the conformity to the Original, there is another certain and eaſy way of judging, whether the Brightning in theſe or any other Points, be proper or not: that Light, we may be ſure, falls in a wrong manner, or an undue proportion, which does not make the thing more viſible.</p>

There are of theſe Deſcriptions, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſus,</hi> which ſeem both to refine too much upon the Original, and to err ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Rule. Did you ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe lines on one of the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Images in the World, The break of Day? they are in the beginning of the third Book: If you will give me leave, I will read them to you.</p>

                  <p>This, if over-wrought, is the more blameable, becauſe the matter is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very far even in the Original, and ſo is the leſs capable of being ſtretch'd any farther.

                  <p>By comparing theſe Paſſages, You will ſee that which I intend; the difference of Manner in the Ancient and Modern Poetry: In the latter we find Expreſſions added, which ſeem to be added for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and which in reality perhaps only turn the Plainneſs and Strength of the Original, into the <hi>Fine</hi> and the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.</hi>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> without queſtion is happy in a great ſhare of Judgment, as well as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity and Spirit in Writing: but it is next to impoſſible, in ſo long a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially as it is in <hi>Rhime,</hi> not to give ſometimes into Sound and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when to crown all, the Vogue of the World goes ſo ſtrong for both. Do not ask, whether I ſhould deſire to ſee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0128700300:30"/>
both of them baniſht out of Poetry; far from it: Expreſſive Sounds are of uſe in the moſt natural, and Variety in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of them, is neceſſary to keep up Attention in the Reader: That, and Ornament, is what ſets Poetry above Proſe. All I wou'd ſay is this, that Sound is not ſufficient where we might expect Senſe; and that in <hi>humble</hi> Paſſages, in <hi>natural</hi> Deſcriptions, or in moving moſt of the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> additional ornaments are ſo many blemiſhes. Dreſſing up the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſiveneſs of <hi>Homer,</hi> in ſuch fineries, is much the ſame as if one ſhou'd throw a very gay modern dreſs over the <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> or any of the moſt Nervous Statues of the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>But You will allow Ornament, where the ſubject will bear it, and where the Original leads the Way?—In a tranſlation (anſwer'd <hi>Antiphaus)</hi> it is proper perhaps, only in the latter Caſe; but allowing it in both, it ſhou'd never be over-wrought in either. Too much Finery is always Affectation: and I wiſh our Writers at preſent were not ſo generally given <hi>to elevate and ſurprize, and all that,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> calls it.</p>
                  <p>The running into this exceſs ſo much, is what has unſinew'd our Poetry. 'Tis with Poetry, as it is in Buildings; the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0128700300:31"/>
being vaſtly Studious of Ornament does not only take away from the Strength of the Work, but is a ſure token of a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated taſte in the Deſigner.</p>
                  <p>You are always blaming the Modern Refinements, ſays <hi>Philypſus;</hi> but will you not allow that this taſte of the Age is a ſufficient juſtification at leaſt of Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> in thoſe caſes where he complies with it?—We muſt <hi>write</hi> ſo as to pleaſe the World, and <hi>ſpeak</hi> ſo as to be moſt eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: Cuſtom will often wear away the propriety of things of this Nature; and as for the propriety of language, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it entirely.

                  <p>They may become the Heroes of our Age (replied <hi>Antiphaus</hi> ſmiling) perhaps on a far different account: there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Character now wove into and blended with that of a Soldier, to which theſe things are very agreeable: How many are there of theſe Heroes, as you call them, whoſe Courage reaches no farther than their Sword-knot, and whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is taken up wholly in their Dreſs? But conſider a Man barely as a Soldier;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0128700300:32"/>
think of him in the midſt of ſome warm Action, and theſe little Ideas of him will diſappear: Then it is <hi>that</hi> poſture, <hi>that</hi> preſſing on the foe, <hi>that</hi> graſping of his Sword, <hi>that</hi> fierceneſs in his Eyes, <hi>that</hi> ſerenity and <hi>that</hi> eagerneſs on his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which ſtrike us wholly, and take up all our attention.

                     <hi>Metaphor,</hi> ſays <hi>Philypſus,</hi> is certainly the moſt univerſal enlivener of Poetry. At the ſame time that it adds to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Verſe, it gives it an agreeable variety; together with a power of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out all its Images, in the boldeſt and ſtrongeſt manner in the World. 'Tis this which animates thoſe objects, which muſt otherwiſe be ſtill and unaffecting: it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus when the Battles are going to join, You ſee <hi>Rage ſtalk</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the Combatants; pointing with one <hi>Hand</hi> to the Enemy, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhaking the <hi>Torch of War.</hi> By this, the Valleys and Mountains <hi>rejoice,</hi> when <hi>Peace</hi> once more <hi>ſpreads</hi> her downy Wings, and <hi>Plenty</hi> deſcends from Heaven upon the <hi>happy</hi> climate.

I long, ſays he, to ſee your Remarks: ſuch a method of viewing a Poem, is ſomething like the way of our favourite <hi>Vertot</hi> in writing Hiſtory: we have the material Parts of it, without paſſing thro' the dead Lines, which go toward the Narrative; or the leſs ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Paſſages, which are to fill up the Chain of Events.

any great Matters, anſwer'd <hi>Philypſus:</hi> Tho' I have had longer time than we talk'd of at firſt, it has been ſufficient only for collecting ſome of the ſcatter'd Beauties of this excellent Tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Lines which you repeated the former Evening, ſhew'd that the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Genius, had led Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſometimes into an Exceſs: if things can be too much beautified, that fault does certainly belong to him. In a few lines, I confeſs, he diſcovers a greater love of Ornament, than is becoming. This is the fountain of all the ſeveral Peccadillo's which you obſerv'd from his writings; whatever there is to be found in them either too <hi>glaring,</hi> or <hi>forc'd,</hi> or <hi>figurative,</hi> or too much <hi>elevated,</hi> may fairly be accounted for this way. You, Sir, produc'd ſome Paſſages, as I remember, under each of theſe Characters: But how pardonable is it, for ſo exalted a Genius, to run ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into an exceſs of Ornament? And how admirable for ſuch, to excell often in the juſt, handſome, natural <hi>Manner?</hi> As Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> in the former, may poſſibly want ſome favourable Allowances; He muſt certainly command the higheſt Eſteem in the latter.</p>

                  <p>The whole <hi>Epiſode</hi> is particularly well wrote; but the things chiefly to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd in it are, the <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus;</hi>—His Speech on the unhappy Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of Men;—the account immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, of the Deaths of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon;</hi> and, above all that enliven'd Concluſion, in Relation to <hi>Elyſium,</hi> and, the future Happineſs of <hi>Menelaus.</hi> You remember the various Transformations of <hi>Proteus;</hi> and, I believe, will allow them to be exceedingly well expreſs'd:</p>

                  <p>The Lines are extremely good, ſays <hi>Antyphaus;</hi> but I had a Thought came into my Head, that poſſeſs'd me, all the time, you were reading them: I cou'd not forbear thinking, what an happy Contrivance it wou'd be in the Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the <hi>Old Houſe,</hi> to bring this Deity upon the Stage, in the ſame manner, that he appears in theſe Verſes. Such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance wou'd ſet their Character in the moſt eminent Light: They wou'd infallibly get the ſtart of their ingenious Rivals; and poor <hi>Doctor Fauſtus,</hi> and his <hi>Dragon,</hi> wou'd no longer be the higheſt Entertainment of the <hi>Beaux Eſprits</hi> of this Age.</p>
                  <p>I am got into another Part of the Poem (ſays <hi>Philypſus)</hi> which might ſerve, in ſome meaſure, to arm their Rivals of <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> againſt ſo formidable an Undertaking.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0128700300:55"/>
part, when <hi>the Heroes</hi> come to make their Appearance. Tho' I am always loſt in the Variety of Beauties, which we find in it; I muſt ſingle out the Speech of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and read (at leaſt) the Concluſion of it to you:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>When War has thunder'd with its loud eſt Storms,</l>
                     <l>Death thou haſt ſeen in all her ghaſtly forms;</l>
                     <l>In duel met her, on the liſted Ground,</l>
                     <l>When hand to hand they wound return for wound:</l>
                     <l>But never have thy Eyes aſtoniſh'd view'd</l>
                     <l>So vile a deed, ſo dire a Scene of Blood.</l>
                     <l>Ev'n in the flow of joy, when now the bowl</l>
                     <l>Glows in our Veins, and opens ev'ry Soul,</l>
                     <l>We groan, we faint; with Blood the dome is dy'd,</l>
                     <l>And o'er the pavement floats the dreadful tyde—</l>
                     <l>Her breaſt all gore, with lamentable cries,</l>
                     <l>The bleeding innocent <hi>Caſſandra</hi> dies!</l>
                     <l>Then, tho' pale death froze cold in ev'ry vein,</l>

                  <p>Surely nothing in Nature can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of greater Strength and Emotion, than this Circumſtance. We ſee the Hero weltring on the Floor, all cover'd with Blood, and in the laſt agonies of Death. It was then, that he heard the Cries and Shrieks of the Daughter of <hi>Priam,</hi> purſued by the Traytors, and ſtab'd to the Heart by the barbarous
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0128700300:56"/>
                     <hi>Clytemneſtra:</hi> expiring as he was, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to raiſe up his Arm, and at laſt gets his Hand upon the hilt of his Sword; which he had ſtrength only to graſp, with a look full of Rage, Compaſſion, and Revenge. Methinks, <hi>Antiphaus,</hi> I ſee him now expired, and dropt upon the Floor: but tho' expired, there is ſtill that Rage and Paſſion in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; he ſtill graſps his Sword, and ſeems to threaten the Traytors and the Adultereſs with his looks.</p>
                  <p>I know nothing finer (ſays <hi>Antiphaus)</hi> than theſe laſt Efforts of dying Heroes. They affect the Soul wonderfully: And the weakneſs of their Body, which will not permit their acting at ſuch times, in my Opinion ſets off their Courage, and their Deſire of Action, in the ſtrongeſt Light imaginable. There is nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural in this; tho' indeed it follows Nature to its laſt Pitch: The beſt Hiſtorians, as well as the firſt Poets, make uſe of ſuch Circumſtances very finely; and I remember Inſtances of it <note n="a" place="bottom">Etiam quos vires ſanguiſque deſereret, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

No, interrupted <hi>Antiphaus,</hi> nothing can be more certain, than the freedom and honeſty of Speech us'd among the Ancients, in this particular; not only before <hi>Homer,</hi> but very long after his time.—If <hi>Homer's Ulyſſes</hi> here calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the wiſeſt of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> his <hi>Achilles</hi> does not ſtick at calling himſelf <hi>the Beſt and moſt Valiant of them;</hi> and that too, in a Council of all the <hi>Princes: Virgil</hi> has given us his Approbation of both the one and the other, in making <hi>Aeneas</hi> talk frequently of his own piety and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.

                  <p>If the <hi>Poet,</hi> proceeded <hi>Philypſus,</hi> can paint out the <hi>Ideas</hi> in the Mind with ſo much Juſtice, as he appears to do by this inſtance; and more particularly by another mention'd before (of the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>openings</hi> and <hi>unfolding</hi> of an unknown Truth, in the Mind of <hi>Circe)</hi> we ſhall find him to have been equally Happy in expreſſing the <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the Soul.

                  <p>But then (continued he) how blind was I to the defects of this Poet. Has not <hi>Antiphaus</hi> ſhown me ſeveral, which before I had no ſenſe of, and which now appear evidently to be ſuch? Indeed that over-ſight was more excuſable in reading the Works of this celebrated Writer, than it wou'd have been in any other: Reaſon may well loſe ſomething of her Liberty, when ſhe is taken up with an Object every way ſo agreeable and engaging: However, for the future, I reſolve to keep my ſelf obſtinately from

                  <p>With theſe Thoughts he open'd the Tranſlation which lay on his desk; and was very buſy in conſidering it, when Company came in, and interrupted him for that Night: The next Day he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd himſelf in the ſame manner; This ſort of view was new to him, and of courſe the more agreeable: Sometimes he met with a line or two, that diſguſted him a little; but much more frequently was he ſtruck with the Beauties of the Poem; and thoſe he enjoy'd with a full Delight, as he found that Delight to be rational and juſt. This ſearch drew him on ſtrangely; he did not know how to leave off: And tho' <hi>Antiphaus</hi> ſtay'd for the Evening before he wou'd diſturb him, he found him ſtill cloſely employ'd at it: "My <hi>Philypſus,</hi> (ſays he) I'm glad to ſee you engag'd thus in the <hi>Odyſſey:</hi> What new light ſhall we have into the excellencies of this writer?

my buſineſs was quite contrary to what you imagine: I was upon a more difficult task; I was endeavouring to try what Faults I cou'd diſcover in it.

mean, tho' that Poet took the <hi>advantage</hi> of writing in Blank-verſe, and freed himſelf from the ſhackles of Modern Rhime. I will not make a digreſſion here (proceeds that Writer) tho' I am ſtrangely tempted to it; but will only ſay, that he who can write <hi>well</hi> in Rhime, may write <hi>better</hi> in Blank-verſe. Rhime is certainly a conſtraint even to the <hi>beſt</hi> Poets, and thoſe who make it with <hi>moſt eaſe:</hi>—What it adds to <hi>Sweetneſs,</hi> it takes away from <hi>ſenſe;</hi> and he who loſes the <hi>leaſt</hi> by it, may be call'd a <hi>Gainer.</hi> It often makes us <hi>ſwerve</hi> from an Author's meaning: as if a mark be ſet up for an Archer at a great diſtance, let him aim as exactly as he can, the leaſt Wind will take his Arrow, and divert it from the White.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> And his opinion weighs the more with me in this caſe; becauſe, if any thing, we might expect that he ſhou'd be prejudiced in favour of Rhime, but the reaſon of the thing, You ſee, prevailed over all other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations: He goes ſofar as to condemn his own manner of Writing, rather than ſuffer ſuch a corruption to paſs without a ſevere Cenſure; and to that end, very generouſly gives up his Practice, to his Judgment.</p>

Indeed I know of but one argument (and that the meereſt <hi>Circle</hi> in the World) to ſupport the preſent practiſe of writing in rhime; we muſt <hi>uſe</hi> it, becauſe 'tis all the <hi>faſhion.</hi> We who were never ſo far infected, can laugh heartily at ſome of the <hi>French,</hi> for rhiming thoroughout their Comedies; yet Rhime in Tragedy was very becoming among us, in an Age, not the leaſt knowing and polite.

                  <p>Well, (ſays <hi>Philypſus)</hi> I own, there is the greater majeſty in Blank verſe; but you will own too, that the other is the more beautiful.

And even as to the Sound, Thoſe muſical returns (if allow'd to be true Beauties) are more than ballanc'd by the <hi>Dead Manner,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd with them into Poetry; What I mean, is that <hi>perpetual likeneſs</hi> in the cadence, and turn of the Periods: How frequently do they fall in ſeveral repeated Couplets, without any variety, or relief to the Ear? You will ſometimes meet with a Rhime-Poem, all the Lines of which run off entirely with the ſame pauſes; the ſtream always equal, and ſo level that you can ſcarce perceive it to move: What do you think of each Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet, chiming on in the ſame ſtops and meaſure, with the moſt tedious unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſound imaginable?—That is the fault of the Poet, not of the uſe of Rhime, ſays <hi>Philypſus:</hi> I could name you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true our Poets of late have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to diverſify the ſound, as much as poſſible: We ſee great improvements of this kind, in the excellent Tranſlator of <hi>Vida</hi>'s <hi>Poeticks;</hi> and ſeveral in the moſt nervous and vigorous of all our Tranſlators, both in his <hi>Manilius</hi> and <hi>Lucretius:</hi> Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſeems to have thought of this much more frequently in his <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> than in the former Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Iliad;</hi> and gives us an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable <note n="a" place="bottom">Od.

But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, let our Poets manage the cadence and ſtructure in Rhime-verſe never ſo artfully, it will fall vaſtly ſhort of Blank in theſe particulars; Indeed Rhime is a natural Enemy to them: it breaks and diſturbs both the ſtructure, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The very ſound of any periods the beſt contriv'd will convince one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

when the ſound of it is not ſufficiently kept under; you will find, that it ſpoils the continuance, and occaſions too great a break in the period.</p>
                  <p>You may ſee by what I have been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this charge is not deſign'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>ſingle Couplets;</hi> The corruption in this reſpect evidently ceaſes, where there are no periods to be varied. To deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine preciſely where it will grow preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial, wou'd be difficult, and is not very material: Tho' I know not but what it might be uneaſy to a very nice Ear, to have only four Lines together with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Rhime: and poſſibly on this very account, the Stanza but of two Couplets has generally unequal Rhimes, (the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Line anſwering the Fourth) and that of Three, varies in the laſt Couplet. However forc'd or delicate this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be thought, one thing I cou'd aſſert with ſome degree of Confidence: I dare ſay, any one of a good Ear, who reads only ten Lines of the beſt Rhime-Verſification, and an equal number of <hi>Milton</hi>'s true harmonious Verſes, upon this view; will find a nobler ſound, and that variety (which is neceſſary to the beauty of periods, and to the pleaſure of a Reader) much ſtronger and much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What has been ſaid of <hi>Couplets,</hi> may in a great Meaſure be ſaid of <hi>Odes,</hi> which conſiſt of proper <hi>Stanzas:</hi> As theſe come next to Couplets for ſhortneſs, they have ſcarce room, ſingly, for the tedious Uniformity, we have been complaining of: and unleſs the <hi>Ode</hi> be long, they do not produce it by their <hi>Number.</hi> There may be a variety too of ſingular uſe in this ſort of Poetry, where a perſon can run theſe <hi>Stanzas</hi> artfully into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if the interweaving of them be not ſo frequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But ſuppoſing Rhime a real beauty in Poems of an higher kind, which I am perſwaded it is not; (to ſpeak nothing of its uniform returns, and the havock which it makes in the Periods; nor even of the <hi>diverſion</hi> it gives the thoughts of the <hi>Reader,</hi> and its general diſſervice to pieces that ſhou'd be ſolid and pathetick: to omit all this) the ſingle reaſon which introduc'd this queſtion is, as I take it, ſufficient to determine it.

In the time that was taken up by this agreeable Search, he call'd often upon that Friend, with whom he ſhar'd his Studies, as well as his Affections. This was rather a Dividing, than Leaving his Purſuits: for he ſcarce ever ſaw <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaus,</hi> without mentioning ſomething of the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> and hearing his Sentiments in return. When he had gone entirely thorough the Poem, he went immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſire a Meeting, in ſome place where they might talk more at large up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Head. By good luck <hi>Antiphaus</hi> was perfectly diſengag'd: <q>'Tis a fine Evening, ſays he; and if you pleaſe we will take a turn together in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of <hi>Horatio:</hi> ſince we cannot enjoy his Company, at leaſt let us make uſe of that Liberty he has left with us.

cannot fail of pleaſing the Eye very much: Yet that Wildneſs and Variety abroad, the River, Lawn, Fields and Woods ſo beautifully interſpers'd, compoſe a Scene much finer and more engaging. For my part, I ſhou'd be apt to prefer that ſingle Grot yonder, and the hanging Precipice over it, to a whole Scenary of natural Objects laid out in the moſt regular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der imaginable. There is ſomething of this in the Pleaſure which is given us by the greateſt Writers. A Noble natural Genius, however irregular and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, delights us in a much higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, than the moſt uniform and correct: And the Writer who enjoys this freedom of Soul, amidſt all his Starts and Errors, is greatly to be prefer'd to the Juſtneſs of one, who is too ſevere to commit a Fault, and too cool and phlegmatick to be a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Such a temper (reply'd <hi>Antiphaus)</hi> can never produce any thing truly Great. The nobleſt Poet in the World has not the feweſt Faults: and the ſame Spirit which qualified <hi>Homer</hi> to be ſo, is what at the ſame time might hurry him away from a nicer Obſervation of ſome little Particulars. The very Negligencies of <hi>Homer</hi> ſhew the Greatneſs of his Spirit: and where there may be any like Negligencies
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0128700300:182"/>
in the Verſion of <hi>Homer,</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, it wou'd be but Juſtice to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute them to the ſame Cauſe: at leaſt where the Spirit of that Poet is ſo diſcernible, as it is in this late Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but ſmile ſometimes, when I hear a ſeverer Reader very gravely condemning a Poem for a few Faults, which may be evident in it here and there. Nothing can be plainer than that our Judgments ought to be form'd upon the Whole, and not upon Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: the Superiority of Beauties or D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects is the only thing that can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Character of the Piece. 'Tis poſſible that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> may have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd a word or two correctly, where the New Tranſlation has deviated into a Metaphorical or licentious Expreſſion: but what a ſtrange method of Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would it be, to ſettle our opinion of the Writers from hence? By ſuch a way of proceeding we might prefer one, who loſes the Life and Vigour of Poetry throughout, to others who preſerve it ſo ſtrongly in the general Turn of their Compoſitions.</p>
                  <p>As we go on, <hi>Philypſus,</hi> with our u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual freedom of ſpeaking our Sentiments on each particular Paſſage; I dare ſay,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0128700300:183"/>
that even all thoſe, which may ſeem faulty to us, will make but a ſmall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, when compar'd to the ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of this Piece. As for my part, after a Reſearch of ſome care thro' the whole Tranſlation, I find no reaſon at all to alter my Opinion, <q>That the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it are far more numerous, and far more conſiderable, than its Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes: even taking all thoſe things for <hi>real</hi> Blemiſhes, which we may only <hi>imagine</hi> to be ſuch.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the faſhionable Choice of <hi>Verſe</hi> be juſtly blameable; it may as juſtly be ſaid that no one moves with more freedom in his Fetters. In particular Lines, there may be ſome farther diſagreeable <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> of Sound; but the <hi>Variety</hi> of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in general is great and handſome: What Smoothneſs and Harmony do we find thro' the courſe of the Poem; and how ſeldom are they interrupted either by the <hi>Littleneſs,</hi> or the <hi>Vaſtneſs</hi> of the Words? by the <hi>Openneſs</hi> of the Vowels, the <hi>Claſhing</hi> of Conſonants, or any other Roughneſſes whatever: Not to mention againſt theſe, that <hi>Significance</hi> of Sound, which is more frequent, and more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily practis'd by Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, than by any other of the Modern Poets.</p>

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0128700300:184"/>
As to the <hi>Diction;</hi> not only the Poem but our Language itſelf is enrich'd by it. Where it is once Mean, it is in many inſtances Great, Noble, and Solemn. Where a Simplicity beyond our Taſte is to be preſerv'd, we may expect ſome Flatneſſes: And it may be to theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we owe that Juſtneſs and Purity, which in ſo many places makes us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that we are converſing with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe Firſt Ages of the World, in all their Plainneſs and Honeſty of Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. At other times the Narration is rais'd, and the Images ſtrengthen'd by a figurative way of ſpeaking, tho' no doubt, in ſome caſes, to exceſs: but theſe Exceſſes may well be paſs'd over, when we conſider, that they proceed from Liberties, which are highly uſeful in rendering the Stile the more various and poetical; ſo far, as frequently to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove upon <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Above all, is that <hi>flame</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd thro' the whole Poem; and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo well kept up, as to make us forget, that we are reading a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When we are engag'd in the Piece, do not the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents we meet with perpetually, make a few Thoughts, which have ſomething <hi>cold</hi> or <hi>little</hi> in them, appear inconſiderable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0128700300:185"/>
upon the firſt Compariſon? What <hi>Eclairciſements</hi> have we, and how little <hi>Obſcurity?</hi> What a number of natural Thoughts, Images, and Deſcriptions might be produc'd, to over-ballance ſuch Lines in it, as may ſeem to be Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or too Artificial?</p>
                  <p>Thus which ever way we turn our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether we conſider the <hi>Poetical Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Language,</hi> or the <hi>Verſification;</hi> in each of them the Beauties far exceed the Defects. It is with this Notion we ought to proceed in our Enquiries: we muſt carry this Thought all along with us. Let us remember <hi>Philypſus,</hi> 
                     <q>That all human Excellence ſtands merely on Compariſon: that no one is without Faults, and that very few arrive in any tolerable degree towards Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> does not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear among the Few, but that his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority is every way viſible: If we compare his Compoſitions in general with thoſe of our other Poets, the Diſproportion is as great, as when we compare the Blemiſhes of his own Poetry, with the Beauties which every where abound in it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of theſe we are now to conſider; and we may enter on this View with the greater Pleaſure, as we have the advantage
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0128700300:186"/>
of Mr. <hi>Pope's</hi> own Obſervations in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Points, both as to thoſe things, in which he met with the greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the Methods he has taken of raiſing his Language, and improving the Verſification.</p>
                  <p>One of the greateſt Sources of raiſing, as well as enlarging the Poetical Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is by inventing New Words, or importing old Ones from a foreign Soil. Words, when they are us'd vulgarly, grow mean: Like other Faſhions, when their uſe is once got among the Populace, they ſoon begin to be rejected by the politer Part of the World. This it is (as <note n="a" place="bottom">

Thus whoever has a Felicity this way, is a Benefactor to the Publick: he adds ſo much to the Bank; and gives his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſupporting the preſent Credit of Language among us.</p>
                  <p>It wou'd be equally trifling and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, to give all the particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Verſion's enriching our Language. It is every where viſible; there

is no reading a Book in the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving it frequently. You will almoſt conſtantly find his new Words to be apt, eaſy, and poetical.

We admire the Stranger in our Habit; and are extremely taken to ſee him look as free and eaſy as if he were a Native, and had been always truly Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>The Poet has the ſame Art and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy in <hi>Connecting</hi> two Words into one, a thing much more difficult than <hi>Invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> The Union is proper and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; there is no Knot, where they are ingrafted: in ſhort, they <note n="a" place="bottom">Thus: <hi>Mellif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

general we may affirm, that as his Tranſlation is wrought off from a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which in this Reſpect greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all that ever were; So the Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, this way, are unuſually Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Harmonious.</p>
                  <p>To deviate from the ſtrict Rules which Grammarians wou'd impoſe on Words, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſingle, or as they ſtand in their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to one another, gives an agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Air to Language; but in the very Notion of it carries ſomething of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and niceneſs along with it. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſeems to have thought it the ſafeſt way in ſuch Caſes to follow or reſemble thoſe Deviations, which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Authoriz'd by ſome Maſterly hand: and where he ſtrikes more boldly into any new Freedom, he is generally careful of giving things ſuch an Openneſs, that they may neither perplex the Senſe, nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs the Period.</p>
                  <p>A thing more uſeful and agreeable than either of theſe, is to turn the ſtream of Words out of their common Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.—There is a good deal of Stiffneſs, which yet attends our Language, from the ſtated order of Words in ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Succeſſion: and tho' we are much freer than our Neighbours the <hi>French</hi> in this particular, I ſhou'd be glad to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0128700300:189"/>
ſee our Poets, at leaſt, go yet farther to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Liberties of the old <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has ſome ſtrokes toward this: he is ſometimes bold in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the expected range of Words, to give his Sentences a new and agreeable air: he tranſpoſes their order, often by his own Judgment, and often in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſome of our beſt Poets, who have ſucceeded in it before.</p>
                  <p>I wou'd not have a certain Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, or two, over-hear me commending theſe Liberties ſo freely: it wou'd cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly coſt one a Diſpute. You know the Men: they are as ſtrict in the Puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's of Words, as ſome formal People are in the little Points of Behaviour. I warrant you, your Neighbour, The Doctor, wou'd ſtand as ſtrictly upon the <hi>Nominative Caſe's going before the Verb,</hi> as <hi>Wicquefort</hi> wou'd for the Precedence of an Embaſſador: 'Tis certain he can ſettle all the Rules of Place from unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Authorities; diſpoſes of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-hand with perfect Oeconomy; and, upon the whole, would make an Excellent <hi>Maſter of the Ceremonies</hi> among Words and Syllables.</p>

                  <p>I wou'd not willingly interrupt you (ſays <hi>Philypſus)</hi> but the humour of heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperannuated Words in ſome late Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, is too provoking to be paſs'd by.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0128700300:191"/>
proſtituted them on all occaſions: in what an undiſtinguiſhing manner do they labour to draw into their Works, any word which their great Maſter has adopted into his <hi>Paradiſe Loſt?—Erſt, Nathleſs, Beheſts, Welkin,</hi> and a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other Expreſſions of equal beauty and agreeableneſs of Sound, are repeated ten times in every Sheet of theirs: in ſhort, theſe Gentlemen have made me quite ſick of People's going two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years backward for their Language; and furniſhing out half their Poems from the Vocabularies annex'd to <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Chaucer.</hi>

You obſerve, <hi>Antiphaus,</hi> that this Event which is ſo often anticipated by the Poet, is the great Point on which the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Fable turns: and I believe you may have obſerv'd, that <hi>Virgil</hi> puts on the Prophetick air, <note n="a" place="bottom">See <hi>Aen.</hi> 10, 501.</note> exactly in the ſame Caſe. <hi>Virgil</hi> oftentimes improves upon his Maſter: the Circumſtance that introduces that Paſſage in the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and the greater diſtance of time, give it a much finer and a nobler Air, than we find in <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Figures (for ſo I beg leave to call all unuſual manners of Speech) are of more difficult Obſervation, as they lye out of the common road: I am afraid of wandering too far; and ſhall therefore return very readily to the more beaten Path.</p>

                  <p>I ought not to diſſemble one thing; That the Tranſlation is not to be truſted entirely in this Argument: we find theſe Paſſages improv'd in the Handling; and thoſe Lines, in which they reſemble our ſacred Writings, may be drawn more ſtrongly. However, the Original it ſelf may give us a great deal of reaſon to ſuppoſe, either that <hi>Homer</hi> had borrow'd ſome lights from thence; or that he cou'd diſcern the Light of Nature more
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0128700300:282"/>
clearly, than any other of the Heathen Writers.</p>
                  <p>Before I compar'd Paſſages, I muſt own to you, that I was in particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Improvements from Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> under this Article. A virtuous gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Soul is certainly as neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Great Poet, as a Great Orator: and in Sentiments like theſe, we may diſcover that temper of Mind, which I dare ſay has contributed much towards making that Gentleman ſo good a Poet, as well as ſo good a Friend.</p>
                  <p>There is one particular more extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frequent in <hi>Homer:</hi> it runs thorough all his Works; and is ſcarce once omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where there is any occaſion for it. I believe your Thoughts outrun me, and might prevent my ſaying, that I mean His Reflections on the Miſeries of this Life. They are moſtly very emphatical; and lead to a very eaſy and uſeful infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0128700300:294"/>
thing fully, and to ſay nothing that is needleſs, requires a great Judgment, and much force in our Expreſſions. The great <hi>Monſieur Paſcal</hi> had a particular hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of comprizing <hi>much</hi> in a <hi>few</hi> Words: he had a very Mathematical Turn of Thought; and of all things hated an idle Prolixity. You will be pleas'd with an Excuſe of his in a certain Caſe, where he had been guilty of it: 'Tis in the cloſe of one of his Letters, where he begs his Friend to pardon the unuſual length of it, by ſaying, <hi>that he really had not time to make it ſhorter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some emphatical Paſſages are not only ſo conciſe, as to contain juſt as <hi>many Ideas</hi> as <hi>Words;</hi> they have often force enough even to <hi>intimate</hi> ſeveral Ideas more than they <hi>expreſs.</hi>

I ſhall not preſume to ſay, how far the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> or <hi>Iliad</hi> might be blameable for any of theſe Meanneſſes in the Days of <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf: it is the Priviledge of every dead Language, to be entirely free from them at preſent. We hear not the Proverbs, nor know the current Ridicule of thoſe Times. His Language is ſafe enough from the Vulgar now; And as to any Words, that might be vulgar enough then, to ſeem low, we are in an entire ignorance. This is a conſiderable Advantage which the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents have over every Living Writer; and for which, by the way, there ſhould be a large allowance made in any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between an Ancient and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern.</p>

                  <p>We may obſerve, by the way, that the Heathen Poets, in comparing a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to any of their Deities, had a ſure Method of giving their Readers a Picture of that Perſon. The Statues of their Deities were known by every one; and the Faces of each as well aſcertain'd, as the Faces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors (for inſtance) can be, by frequently converſing with their Medals; This I take to be one Reaſon, why this ſort of Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ſo very frequent in the Ancients: The Caſe is very different in any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Compoſition; tho' we ſeem to be equally fond of the ſame Compariſons.</p>

                  <p>'Tis the proper air of Poetry to be unconfin'd and free: The Muſe loves a flowing Dreſs: Her motions are ever Eaſy, and her very ornaments muſt be Natural.

                     <hi>Homer</hi> is almoſt ſingular in another ſort of Similie, the Reverſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: when the Principal Figures have in themſelves no Likeneſs, but agree in ſome one Circumſtance of Action.

                  <p>Perhaps this is blameable; and ſo may be that ſtringing of ſeveral Similies together, which we ſometimes meet with in <hi>Homer.</hi> I do not mean when ſeveral things are choſen to illuſtrate the <note n="a" place="bottom">See Ιλ. ξ, 394.</note>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0128700300:360"/>
Diſſimulation well in Poetry. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Paſſion muſt appear moſt ſtrongly, and yet the real Paſſion muſt appear under it. It muſt be like the Drapery in Pictures, which ſhews the turn of the Limbs, at the ſame time that it hides them; and in particular, puts one in Mind of that Veil in <hi>Homer, which ſeems and only ſeems</hi> to ſhade the Face of <hi>Penelope.</hi>

                  <p>There is nothing more difficult in Poetry, than to expreſs juſtly Ideas in the Minds of Perſons whom we deſcribe.

Theſe will alter Men's Views of the very ſame Point; When <hi>Neſtor</hi> talks of Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in War, he will dwell chiefly upon the Prudence and Experience of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; <hi>Hector</hi> will mention the great effects of Strength and Courage; <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A Man's Notions of Excellence are form'd generally from ſome advanc'd Powers of his own. Each Man is apt to make himſelf the Meaſure of all the Species; and his Species the Standard of all Perfection. All Beings above him muſt be exactly like the ſuperior Moyety of his own Being, and all below him muſt be purely of the Inferior. The Vulgar of Mankind form their Heaven hereafter out of thoſe things which have pleas'd them moſt in Life; and the very Notions of the Deity in moſt Men take a Turn from their own Complexions. The God of proud <hi>tyrannical</hi> Minds is a Being, that delights only in the <hi>Glory of being Terrible;</hi> as with the ſoft and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, The Deity is <hi>all Mercy:</hi> the Gods of <hi>Epicurus</hi> were mere pleaſurable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences; and the Deities of the <hi>Irro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quois</hi> are <hi>Mighty Hunters.</hi> Commend me to that Philoſopher who ſaid, that <hi>were his Horſe to give us his Notion in this Caſe; A Broad Cheſt and a Flowing Mane would certainly be the Principal things in it.</hi>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0128700300:362"/>
our Minds. I know not that it is yet deſignedly manag'd in any Syſtem of Philoſophy, (for Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s <hi>Aſſociation</hi> of <hi>Ideas</hi> ſeems to be ſomething very diſtinct from it) and as it wants a Name, give me leave to call it for the preſent, The <hi>Aſſimilation of Ideas.</hi>

We may ſee in the Deſcriptions of the Poets, how this Paſſion acts on the Soul through all its different Degrees, from a <hi>Wavering</hi> and <hi>Irreſolution</hi> of Mind, to the Exceſs of <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Deſpair.</hi>

                  <p>It is to the Honour of the Art (in this general Senſe) that the Poets, when they are copying from Painting, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally exceed themſelves.

                  <p>In both of theſe, the Poets uſe a way of ſpeaking in relation to Picture, which is very Strong and Emphatical; and which may ſhew the high Notions they entertain'd of this Art: They do not ſay, that the Images <hi>ſeem</hi> to perform ſuch Actions; but talk of 'em as <hi>real Life:</hi> They ſay directly, that they Move, and Act, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Kind of Muſical Sympathy. How far this may reach in others, I know not; but as for my particular Make, 'tis ſtrangely ſuſceptible of ſuch Impreſſions.

                  <p>Why, ſeriouſly, ſays <hi>Philypſus,</hi> I have often thought him quite tedious on theſe particulars: The Orator, even the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, ſeem'd to be loſt ſometimes, and nothing but a mere Pedant appear in their room.

Beſides: this is not ſo difficult to be attain'd, as one wou'd imagine. The fitneſs of Sounds to things is natural: <hi>Invention</hi> itſelf will go ſome way in the Work; and where there is naturally (What we call) a <hi>Good Ear,</hi> Nature will do the Buſineſs almoſt without the help of Art. I do not ſpeak this in a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory way, Good <hi>Philypſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s;</hi> I imagine Fact and Experience will go a great way in proving what I ſay. A Man, who thinks vehemently, will ſpeak ſwiftly; and when we are on a grave Point, our Words will of themſelves be in a great Meaſure ſlow and weighty. This is yet plainer from the <hi>Invention</hi> of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; How many ſingle Words are there in every Tongue, that have been originally caſt in a proper Mould, and on the firſt Heat carried off the Images of things impreſs'd upon them? I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too, that the poſture of the Mind at the time of Compoſing, will aſſiſt the turn of the Compoſition; And is this more abſurd in particular Caſes, than that the Temper of a People in general ſhould affect their Language in the ſame manner? Yet has it been often obſerv'd that the Diſpoſitions of a People are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable in that Turn of Words they chiefly delight in. Thus the <hi>French</hi>

Tongue is brisk and voluble: The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> talk in vaſt Syllables and perpetual Conſonants: <hi>Engliſh</hi> is neither too ſoft, nor too rough: tho' our <hi>Northerly</hi> Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inclines us rather to the latter: And, as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is the moſt haughty of all Nations, their Language is the moſt Grand; it prides itſelf in firm Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, in a frequency of the fulleſt Vowel, and the moſt ſonorous Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its Words.</p>
                  <p>Nature certainly forms us within for fit Sounds: We ſee every Day that even Brutes can expreſs their Paſſions by the <hi>Tone</hi> of their Voice; and is not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Being as well qualified by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to adapt Sounds to his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

What Nature has done in ſingle Words the Poet carries on in Compoſition; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the particular Names of Sounds themſelves, for inſtance, are naturally ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant in moſt Languages; as with us, the <hi>Roaring</hi> of Waves, the <hi>Whiſtling</hi> of Winds &amp;c. Of ſuch Words, aſſiſted by a proper ſtructure of Quantities, and a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Cadence of Verſe, the Poet makes an Hurricane by Land, or a Storm at Sea. Nature firſt preſided in eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe proper ſounds, and ſtill directs in the Aſſemblage of them.</p>

Hence it is that this Point takes ſuch a Compaſs in the Doctrine of the Criticks.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0128700300:388"/>
Sounds do not, like the Modern, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to rival the Senſe; their whole Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to make the Sentiments more ſtrongly perceiv'd, and more effective on the Mind.</p>
                  <p>I have heard it frequently objected to thoſe Gentlemen, the Criticks, that they find out ſeveral Beauties of this Kind in the Works of <hi>Homer,</hi> which he, never ſo much as dream't of in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing 'em. In many Caſes this may be true; and in many the Lines may be juſtly commended, and really ſignificant, tho' that particular Beauty might not be deſign'd in compoſing them: But thoſe, who can perſwade themſelves, that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> never deſign'd any ſuch thing in his Writings, I ſhould think, might ſoon bring themſelves to believe (what has been ſo frequently produc'd as an inſtance of Abſurdity) that his Poems might be made by chance.</p>
                  <p>The Notes of Muſick in a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition are fitted to the Subject: And a good Copy of Verſes wrote for Muſick will be fitted for Notes. I cannot once doubt, that the firſt Stanza in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Ode for St. <hi>Caecilia</hi>'s Day has a <hi>deſign'd</hi> Harmony all thorough it. 'Tis juſt the ſame Caſe with <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poems:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0128700300:389"/>
They were all made for Muſick; and have been all ſang to the Lyre.</p>
                  <p>As for my part, ſays <hi>Philypſus,</hi> I find Muſick enough in them, even now, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Lyriſt. Neither have I any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the Criticks for giving meplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and pointing out Beauties of this kind, whether deſign'd by <hi>Homer</hi> or not. But I wonder at one thing: while they ſpeak of the Defect in this point perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, I never yet heard them ſpeak of any Exceſs in it: 'Tis certain, that the greater Number of Poets err in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſignificant Turn of their Verſes: but is there no erring too by an Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it?</p>
                  <p>I thank you, (anſwer'd <hi>Antiphaus)</hi> for putting me in mind of this particular. Undoubtedly there may be faults on both ſides: Even in the Poem before us I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, this is ſometimes carried too far, and ſometimes us'd improperly: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmneſs of a Couplet, mention'd on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occaſion, agrees with the thing deſcrib'd, and may perhaps be blameable on that very Account.</p>
