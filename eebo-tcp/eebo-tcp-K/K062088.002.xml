            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE reflections of Celeſtina when ſhe
was alone were full of bitterneſs and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.
It was in vain that ſhe wearied her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with conjectures on the cauſe of her
misfortune: ſhe could find no probability
in any that preſented themſelves. It could
not be caprice, nor that cruel delight
which men have ſometimes taken in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly
inflicting pain, and torturing by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
the hearts they have taught
to love them, for of ſuch conduct ſhe
knew Willoughby to be incapable; it
could not be a diſpute with Vavaſour or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0206900202:4"/>
any other young man, for ſuch, however
alarming, muſt ſoon have been decided;
nor could it be any pecuniary difficulty
that had thus divided them, ſince Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
in talking over their future
proſpects, had related to her the ſituation
of his fortune with the utmoſt clearneſs
and preciſion; it could hardly be a prior
matrimonial engagement, for from his
infancy he had loved her, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly
told her that he never had the
leaſt partiality for any other woman, and
he was truth and candour itſelf; it could
not be any impediment raiſed by the
Caſtlenorths, for however great might be
their diſpleaſure and diſappointment, they
had no power over Willoughby's actions,
and he did not love them well enough to
make it probable that their perſuaſions or
remonſtrances could induce him to give
up the favourite project of his life, and
abandon her whom he ſo paſſionately loved
to diſgrace and miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0206900202:5"/>
Whatever was the cauſe, however, of
the ſudden reſolution he had taken, miſery
was certain: ſhe obſerved that in the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
which Cathcart repeated as having
paſſed between him and Willoughby, no
mention was made of a probability of his
return—no hope thrown out, that their
union was rather ſuſpended than put an
end to. All was dark and comfortleſs;
and in the myſtery which ſurrounded the
whole affair, there was ſomething of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and apprehenſion which ſeemed more
inſupportable than the certainty of any evil
except Willoughby's death.</p>
            <p>Cathcart, however, had given her a
motive to ſupport her courage, in telling
her that nothing but the knowledge of her
bearing his loſs without injury to her
health or her affection for him, could
ſoothe or diminiſh the anguiſh with which
Willoughby was himſelf oppreſſed. "Let
me endeavour then," ſaid ſhe, "to give
him this ſatisfaction, as the laſt proof I
ſhall perhaps ever be able to give him of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0206900202:6"/>
my tender, my unalterable love. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as I am to everlaſting regret,
daſhed from the ſummit of happineſs to
long and hopeleſs ſorrow for the reſt of
my life, let my reſolution in ſuffering with
calmneſs ſhew that I ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the happineſs which heaven once
ſeemed to have ſettled as my lot. Heaven
only knows wherefore I am condemned to
loſe and lament it."</p>
            <p>The ſolemn promiſe which Willoughby
had owned his mother had aſked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him in her laſt moments now
occurred to her. "Perhaps it is for the
intended breach of that promiſe," cried
ſhe, "that we are puniſhed: yet from
whence? the ear that heard it, the anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
maternal heart that obtained it, are
duſt! My benefactreſs comes not from the
grave to claim it: it was known only to
her, to her ſon, and to me. Who is there
who could enforce it now, and to whom
would Willoughby liſten, after obviating
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0206900202:7"/>
all the objections I urged againſt it's viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?"</p>
            <p>This fatal promiſe, however, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
hung heavy on the heart of Celeſtina,
even in her happieſt moments, and ſhe
ſeemed now to be paying the price of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ever conſented to break it. Still, ſtill
the inexplicable myſtery remained; and
the hand from which the blow came that
had divided her and Willoughby was
equally hid in obſcurity.</p>
            <p>When a misfortune, however heavy, is
certain, the mind ſinks reſiſtleſs beneath it;
and feeling all remedy ineffectual, it ceaſes
all attempt to apply any: but this was
not the caſe with Celeſtina: while the
cauſe of her being torn from Willoughby
was unknown, there appeared a poſſibility
that it might be removed; and though he
had held out no ſuch hope in his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Cathcart, her reaſon now ſeized
this idea as her only reſource. He had
beſought her to bear their ſeparation with
patience; he had hopes then ſurely that it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0206900202:8"/>
would end: he had entreated her not to
forget her affection for him; ſurely he had
expectations then that he might again
claim it. Her ſanguine temper encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
theſe faint rays of comfort, which a
few moments before ſeemed to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
for ever. The firſt ſhock was
paſſed; the tears ſhe had ſhed had relieved
her overburthened heart, and ſhe prepared
with ſome degree of ſerenity to go down to
Mr. Thorold, Cathcart, and Jeſſy, and to
conſult with them on what ſhe ought to do.</p>
            <p>When ſhe again entered the room, the
little group which were aſſembled in it,
their melancholy and anxious looks, and
the different expectations with which their
meeting had been appointed, combined
to affect her, and to ſhake the little reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
ſhe had with ſo much difficulty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired:
ſhe ſat down, however, and Mr.
Thorold, with a degree of fatherly tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
approached her and took her hand.</p>
            <p>"My dear young friend," ſaid the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
man, "this dignified compoſure is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0206900202:9"/>
worthy of your excellent underſtanding.
Do you think me deſerving the honour of
being your adviſer, if, in the preſent ſtate
of circumſtances, you feel that you want
one?"</p>
            <p>"I do indeed ſeverely feel," replied
Celeſtina faultering, "the neceſſity of a
friend who is able to adviſe me; and where,
dear Sir, can I find one ſo equal to it, if
you will but undertake the trouble."</p>
            <p>"Well then," replied Mr. Thorold,
"we will not go over the occurrences that
have happened, nor attempt to account
for them: ſome unforeſeen events have
divided you and my friend Willoughby,
and I am very ſure, that whatever they are,
they muſt, if irretrievable, embitter the
reſt of his life: he wiſhes you, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
from Mr. Cathcart, to remain here at
leaſt till you have letters from him. Do you
intend to do ſo?"</p>
            <p>"I hardly know," anſwered Celeſtina
faintly, "what I ought to do."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0206900202:10"/>
"It ſeems to me," ſaid Mr. Thorold,
"that whatever reaſon has had ſo much
influence on him as to compel him to quit
you, ſhould render your abode in his houſe
improper."</p>
            <p>"I will return then, Sir, ſince that is
your opinion, to the lodging I left at
Thorpe Heath."</p>
            <p>"That will be very melancholy and
unpleaſant to you I fear."</p>
            <p>"It certainly will: but what have I to
do now but to learn to ſuffer? Local cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
will have little power to add
to the ſorrow I muſt endure, while uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of what is become of Mr. Willoughby:
doubting whether I may not have been the
cauſe that ſome evil has befallen him, and
ſure of nothing—but that I muſt be
wretched if I never ſee him again."</p>
            <p>"I would very fain comfort without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
you if I could. <hi>I hope you will</hi>
ſee him again: yet nothing ſurely but ſome
very extraordinary event could have taken
him from you; but you hear that he was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0206900202:11"/>
well—that he promiſed to write to you:
it is poſſible that letter may explain what
all our conjectures can do little in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up: let us leave them, therefore; and
do you, my dear Miſs de Mornay, reſolve
to fulfil his parting injunctions as far as
prudence will permit. I cannot ſay I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of your ſtaying here, or of your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back to indulge your uneaſineſs in the
mournful ſecluſion of your cottage; let me
propoſe therefore a middle way, by which
you will receive this expected letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
quitting the neighbourhood, and be
ready to obey any wiſh of our dear Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
without receiving it at Thorpe
Heath, where you would have nobody to
aſſiſt you in it's execution. Will you go
home with me?"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who already felt the value of
ſuch a friend as ſhe ſeemed to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in Mr. Thorold, and who foreſaw
that ſhe muſt loſe Jeſſy, who could not
ſtay long from her grandfather, would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have embraced this offer. She knew
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0206900202:12"/>
that Willoughby had the warmeſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
for Mr. Thorold, and that he would
probably approve of ſuch a propoſal; but
ſhe was unacquainted with his wife, and
dreaded to intrude herſelf into a family
where ſhe might find only the maſter of it
diſpoſed to receive her: ſhe objected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the trouble ſhe ſhould give, and to
the impropriety of introducing herſelf, thus
unaſked, to the acquaintance of his
lady; but Mr. Thorold obviated all her
objections, aſſured her ſhe ſhould have an
apartment to herſelf, and that his wife
would conſider her as his daughter, his
daughter as her ſiſter; and Celeſtina, who
could not think without pain of going
alone to Thorpe Heath, which ſhe had
left with proſpects ſo very different, and
from whence her books and cloaths had
been removed, conſented to go with Mr.
Thorold, and to remain with him at leaſt
till ſhe heard from Willoughby.</p>
            <p>It was then ſettled that at leaſt part of
the original errand which had brought Mr.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0206900202:13"/>
Thorold to Alveſtone ſhould be completed,
and that Cathcart and Jeſſy ſhould be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
ſince her father was already waiting
to give her away, and ſince Cathcart was
to remain at Alveſtone by the particular
directions of Willoughby on their parting.
Celeſtina could not be preſent at the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
but while it was performing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
herſelf with as much reſolution as
ſhe could for her little journey. When
they returned from the altar, ſhe kiſſed in
ſilence the weeping Jeſſy, who clung round
her unable to bid her adieu: ſhe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to Cathcart the cloſeſt adherence
to every injunction laid on him by Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
and beſought him to come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
over to her with the expected letter as
ſoon as it arrived; and then with faulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſteps went to the chaiſe which was in
waiting for her by Mr. Thorold's orders.
He placed himſelf by her; and ſhe was
thus removed, probably as ſhe thought for
ever, from the houſe, of which, only a few
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0206900202:14"/>
hours before, ſhe conſidered herſelf as the
fortunate miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>As ſhe paſſed along the avenue, the
bench under one of the great elms, where
ſhe had ſo often ſat with Willoughby in
their childhood, and where only a few
days before he had been recalling thoſe
delightful times to her recollection, ſtruck
her moſt: it looked like a monument to
the memory of loſt happineſs! As the
great gate of the park ſhut after the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
ſhe felt exiled for ever from the
only ſpot in the world that contained any
odject intereſting to her; and though little
diſpoſed to think of poetry, almoſt invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
repeated—</p>
            <q>
               <l>O unexpected ſtroke, worſe than of death,</l>
               <l>Muſt I then leave thee paradiſe? thus leave</l>
               <l>Thee native ſoil, theſe happy walks and ſhades!</l>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. Thorold, to whom ſorrow was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
attempted not to call off her thoughts
from their preſent mournful employment;
but glad to ſee that her ſorrow broke not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0206900202:15"/>
out in thoſe violent and convulſive expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
which many women would have
given way to, he contented himſelf with
adminiſtering to her in ſilence all the
offices of friendſhip; and when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at his houſe, which was about five
miles from Alveſtone, he got out and went
in firſt to prepare his family for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their unexpected viſitor. After a
few moments he returned, and aſſured her
that both Mrs. Thorold and his daughter
would be happy to ſee her, and think
themſelves honoured by her abode with
them; "but," added he, "perhaps you
had rather go to your own chamber than
be introduced immediately to ſtrangers."
Celeſtina had already repented of having
accepted Mr. Thorold's offer, however
friendly it was, and felt that in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate of mind the moſt forlorn ſolitude
would have been better for her than the
reſtraint ſhe muſt unavoidably ſubmit to,
and the enquiries that, if not by words,
the looks of all who ſaw her would make
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0206900202:16"/>
into the cauſe of the ſtrange revolution that
had happened in her circumſtances: but it
was now too late to retreat, and ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to go through at once a ceremony,
the delay of which would not render it leſs
diſtreſſing.</p>
            <p>She anſwered, therefore, with more ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
of voice than could be expected, that
ſhe could not too ſoon avail herſelf of
Mrs. Thorold's kindneſs, and was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
introduced to her and her only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married
daughter.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Thorold was what the world agrees
to call a very good ſort of woman, but one
of thoſe who are beſt deſcribed by nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
ſhe had no poſitive failings, but a
ſort of feminine pride, which made her
very anxious that none of her neighbours,
at leaſt none of the rank of private gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
ſhould have handſomer cloaths, or
better furniture, or a nicer houſe; and
while ſhe carefully guarded her own dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
ſhe indulged ſomewhat too much
curioſity in enquiring into the minuteſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0206900202:17"/>
by which the conſequence of others
could be diminiſhed or encreaſed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thorold, whoſe ſtrong underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taught him to ſee and bear her foibles,
had taken the utmoſt pains to check in his
daughters a propenſity to imitate them.
The three elder had been married ſome
years, and were ſettled in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of London. Arabella, the youngeſt,
was now about two and twenty, rather
pretty in her perſon, and pleaſing in her
manners: with much of her father's ſenſe,
ſhe had a little of the vanity of her mother;
but it had taken another turn: though ſhe
dreſſed faſhionably, and her ſiſters always
took care, by ſending her the neweſt modes
from London, to enable her to give the
<hi>ton</hi> in that remote country, ſhe piqued her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
leſs on that advantage than on being
reckoned extremely accompliſhed. In
conſequence of this rage, ſhe played on
ſeveral kinds of inſtruments mechanically,
for ſhe had no ear, and ſung in a feigned
voice, for nature had denied her a natural
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0206900202:18"/>
one. In languages ſhe was more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
under the inſtructions of her father
ſhe had early been taught Latin, and that
knowledge facilitated her acquiring the
French and Italian, which ſhe wrote and
underſtood better than ſhe ſpoke them:
ſhe took likeneſſes in crayons; painted
landſkapes in oil; and the apartments
were furniſhed with her worſted works and
embroidery.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina had hardly gone through the
firſt ceremonies of her reception than ſhe
found a relief from the inquiſitive looks of
the mother and daughter, in admiring
theſe performances. "You do my trifling
productions a great deal of honour," ſaid
Miſs Thorold, "and your praiſe cannot
fail of being very gratifying to me, as I
underſtand you are yourſelf ſo extremely
accompliſhed."</p>
            <p>"Indeed," anſwered Celeſtina, "you
have been miſinformed. I can boaſt of
no ſuch advantage: but I am extremely
fond of muſic and of drawing, and uſed to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0206900202:19"/>
pleaſe a very partial friend by attempting
them: ſince her death, my time has paſſed
in a very unſettled way, and I have now
no motive to tempt me to recover what
in that deſultory life I have loſt of the little
I knew."</p>
            <p>Miſs Thorold, who had heard Celeſtina
repreſented as excelling, was not ſorry to
find ſhe poſſeſſed no ſuch very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
over her; and Celeſtina, to whom
any thing was preferable to converſation,
preſſing her to ſit down to the harpſichord,
ſhe complied with that air of confidence
which the certainty of excelling gives; and
till dinner ſhe continued to play ſonatas
and leſſons, all of which Celeſtina failed
not to applaud, though ſhe had ſo little
idea of what ſhe heard, that ſhe could not
have aſſigned one to it's proper compoſer:
her thoughts were fled after Willoughby;
and from the ſtrange reverſe ſhe had experienced,
nothing had power to detach
them. Dinner, tea, and ſupper, at length
were over; the preſence of Mr. Thorold
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0206900202:20"/>
prevented his wife from aſking queſtions
which were every moment riſing to her
lips; and Celeſtina was permitted to retire
to her own room at an early hour. The
extreme fatigue ſhe had ſuffered the night
before, and the ſolicitude of ſpirit ſhe had
endured for ſo many hours, had ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
nature that ſhe ſunk into ſlumber;
but it was diſturbed and broken by hideous
dreams. In the morning, however, ſhe
found herſelf better: her mind had not yet
recovered from it's conſternation, but ſhe
could now think of all that had happened
with more ſteadineſs. In the letter ſhe
expected from Willoughby, ſhe had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to look forward to, which might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate
but could not encreaſe her anxiety,
as whatever cleared up the myſtery would,
ſhe thought, be a relief to her, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
however painful, ſhe was ſure ſhe
could endure better than wild conjectures
and terrifying ſuſpenſe.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <p>ALL the following day paſſed without
any tidings of Cathcart, in ſearch of
whom the anxious eyes of Celeſtina were
continually turned towards the window.
Mr. Thorold went out to his farm and
among his pariſhioners in his uſual way,
and had charged his wife to let Celeſtina
be miſtreſs of her time, and not to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
her with queſtions or even with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation:
to Arabella alſo he had given
the ſame injunctions: but the native po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs
of Celeſtina had made both the
ladies believe ſhe was pleaſed by their
converſation and intereſted in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
and to avoid the appearance of
rudeneſs or ſingularity, Celeſtina now
forced herſelf into ſome degree of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0206900202:22"/>
to their endeavours to entertain her,
liſtened to the details Mrs. Thorold gave
of the affairs of the neighbourhood, and
gave her daughter her opinion of the
moſt elegant mixture of colours in a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag
ſhe was compoſing for one of her
ſiſters, heard with patient politeleſs a long
poem, written by young Thorold, who
was now at Oxford, and aſſented to the
juſtice of Arabella's complaints that there
was very little rational ſociety in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that every body now forſook their
diſtant ſeats to paſs their ſummers at
ſome watering place, and that unleſs one
could enter into the amuſements of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
circle, there was to be found in the
country no amuſement at all.</p>
            <p>So paſſed the long long day, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and another in the ſame manner,
relieved by nothing but the ſilent though
tender ſympathy with which Mr. Thorold
himſelf ſeemed to enter into the feelings of
his fair, unhappy gueſt. He looked at
her with eyes that told her all the concern
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0206900202:23"/>
her ſituation gave him; and appeared
hurt that both his wife and daughter, though
they behaved to her with all the attention
and kindneſs poſſible, ſeemed not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that on a mind like hers, in its
preſent ſituation, the common occurrences
of life could not be obtruded but to pain
and fatigue. He however ſpoke not to
them, of what, he feared, they had not
delicacy of feeling enough to comprehend;
but knowing of the expected letter from
Willoughby, he became towards the noon
of the fourth day almoſt as anxious for
its arrival, and almoſt as uneaſy at its long
delay, as Celeſtina herſelf.</p>
            <p>Her ſolicitude was by that time become
inſupportable. She could no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it under the appearance of attending
to her hoſts; but took the opportunity of
Mrs. Thorold's being engaged in domeſtic
buſineſs, and Arabella at her muſic, to
ſteal into the garden; where ſhe hid herſelf
in a ſort of alcove cut in an hedge of holly
and other evergreens that bounded the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0206900202:24"/>
garden towards the road, and there gave
way to the tormenting apprehenſions that
corroded her heart. It was now Tueſday:
Willoughby had been gone ſince the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Wedneſday evening; and had he
gone to London immediately, and written
from thence as he promiſed, the letter
muſt long ſince have reached Cathcart by
the return of the poſt: but ſhe knew that
unleſs he was greatly changed it was not
to the poſt he would entruſt the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a letter on which her exiſtence
perhaps depended; the delay therefore ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
all the terrors ſhe felt; but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day paſt, and ſhe was ſtill obliged to
endure them. To diſguiſe her diſtreſs
however was impracticable; and without
hoping to impoſe upon her friends by ſo
common an artifice, ſhe was at length com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to ſay, that ſhe had an head ach
which was very ſevere unleſs when ſhe was
in the open air; and that ſhe was rendered
by it quite incapable of converſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0206900202:25"/>
Having thus obtained the liberty of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
alone in the garden, ſhe paſſed
there the whole morning of Wedneſday:
ſometimes reflecting with the bittereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
on the different proſpects which were
before her on the Wedneſday of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
week, and ſometimes bewildering
herſelf in conjectures, on the cauſe of their
having thus vaniſhed from her.</p>
            <p>Spring had within that period made a
rapid progreſs; but Celeſtina no longer
heeded the beauties that ſurrounded her:
hers was now that ſtate of mind when—</p>
            <q>
               <l>'Tis nought but gloom around; the darken'd Sun</l>
               <l>Loſes his light; the roſy-boſom'd Spring</l>
               <l>To weeping Fancy pines, and yon bright arch,</l>
               <l>Contracted, bends into a duſky vault:—</l>
               <l>All Nature fades extinct—<note n="*" place="bottom">Thomſon.</note>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>Even flowers, of which ſhe was paſſionately
fond, had loſt the influence they once had
over her fancy. She ſaw them not; or
ſeeing them, only recollected that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0206900202:26"/>
had ſhewn her at Alveſtone a bed
of ſuch hyacinths, whoſe bloom and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance
he had fondly anticipated, knowing
how much ſhe delighted in them: ſhe
remembered with a ſigh each particular
leaf and bloſſom that compoſed the laſt
noſegay he gathered for her, on the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that day, when they were divided,
never, as ſhe now feared—to meet again!</p>
            <p>Such were her ſad recollections, as, hardly
knowing what ſhe did, ſhe traverſed the
graſs walk which was divided by a hedge
of evergreens from the road. Her mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
reverie was interrupted by the ſound of
horſes feet. She flew to the gate: it was
Cathcart! who on perceiving her threw
himſelf from his horſe and gave her the
long expected letter, which ſhe received
with ſuch marks of extreme agitation, that
Cathcart, afraid ſhe would fall, left his
horſe to find it's way to the ſtable, and
came to ſupport her.</p>
            <p>She leaned on his arm, attempting to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0206900202:27"/>
ſpeak, and after a moment's pauſe ſaid—"Cathcart,
you have had a letter alſo?"</p>
            <p>"I have."</p>
            <p>"Before I have courage to open my
own, tell me—is Willoughby well? and
are there hopes of our ſeeing him again?"</p>
            <p>"He is well," anſwered Cathcart; but
of ſeeing him again he gives me no hopes:
to you, perhaps, he may be, and I hope
is more explicit."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina ſtaid not to reply; but hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as well as ſhe was able to her own
room, tore open her letter, which was in
theſe words:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>

                  <p>What muſt be the miſery the man
endures, who only a few days ſince had
the immediate proſpect of calling Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
his, and who is now compelled
not only to leave her, but to leave her
uncertain whether he may ever again
dare to entertain that hope—whether he
ſhall ever ſee her more!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0206900202:28"/>
How I have loved you, Celeſtina—how
I ſtill love you—I ſurely need not
repeat. This paſſion you well know—
<q>Grew with my growth, and ſtrengthen'd with my
ſtrength:</q>
you will not therefore believe that any
circumſtance can diminiſh—any time
efface it. Yet ſuch are the barriers
that may be between us, that perhaps
I may never dare again to ſee you; or
only when I have ſubmitted to the
dreadful ſacrifice required of me, and
given my hand to one to whom my
heart muſt ever be a ſtranger: and
yet, Celeſtina, if to this I ever do
ſubmit, it will only be to enable me to
place you in the ſituation you deſerve as
to fortune, and becauſe it matters not,
if I cannot paſs my life with you, with
whom it may be my deſtiny to paſs
it; for then, it muſt in every event
be equally unhappy. Celeſtina! I am
aware of the appearance my conduct
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0206900202:29"/>
muſt have in your eyes; aware of it
without having the power to explain
it. I have ſworn that I will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil
this fatal myſtery till I either can
ſee you, with all thoſe delicious hopes
<hi>unempoiſoned</hi> that were ſo lately mine,
or till I have learned to regard you—not
with leſs affection, for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
but with—I bewilder my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—I
know not what I would ſay—only
let this be underſtood as my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that wherever I may be, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I may become, my fondeſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
my love, my eſteem, muſt be
yours. It is more than probable that I
ſhall go abroad; and you, Celeſtina,
whither will you go? Suffer me to
name my wiſhes, though I hardly dare
hope you will comply with them—Why
ſhould you not ſtay at Alveſtone? If
<hi>ever I return to it,</hi> you will be it's
miſtreſs; if I never return, you might
find a melancholy pleaſure—But again
I am wandering from my point: I will
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0206900202:30"/>
not dictate to you, my lovely friend, I,
who am incapable of judging what I
ought to do for myſelf; for in the midſt
of my reflections a thouſand bitter
poſſibilities diſtract me: Celeſtina may
renounce me as unworthy of her; may
learn to deſpiſe me, or what is yet
more dreadful, ſhe may learn to love
another. Oh! Celeſtina! ſhould this
ever happen—ſhould you ever give
that heart, which it was the glory of
my life to poſſeſs, to another!—and
yet, ſituated as I may find myſelf, it
may perhaps be—But I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
while I am able, and call off my
thoughts from myſelf, to promote Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina's
future comforts, if I can yet
contribute to it, who have perhaps been
it's deſtroyer.</p>
                  <p>Do not write to me. Expreſſions of
your anxiety and regret I cannot bear.
It is as much as I can now do to keep
my ſenſes. Gracious heaven! that ever
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0206900202:31"/>
I ſhould ſay to Celeſtina, do not write
to me!</p>
                  <p>Cathcart has my directions how to
act in all pecuniary matters at Alveſtone,
and to ſtay in the houſe till he takes
poſſeſſion of his own, which I ſuppoſe
will be as ſoon as old Winnington dies:
then he will continue to ſuperintend the
farm, and to receive the rents, out of
which I have directed him to pay you
fifty guineas every quarter, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
any farther demands that you may
make upon him: and you muſt not,
Celeſtina, refuſe this; for remember that
the maſter of the whole fortune ſhould
now have been your's, and that you
have a right to this trifle—perhaps to
much more. But if theſe reaſons are
inſufficient to conquer your reluctance,
remember, Celeſtina, that Willoughby,
the unhappy Willoughby aſks it of you,
as the greateſt alleviation his wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
now admits of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0206900202:32"/>
Wherever you are, let Cathcart give
me conſtant information; and whenever
I can tell you that the weight which now
preſſes on my heart is removed, I will
write—write! no I will then fly to my
Celeſtina from the extremity of the
earth. Perhaps I may now be in a few
days on the ſea; but I go no farther
but to the South of Europe. Celeſtina,
it would be a very great comfort to me
to hear from Cathcart, before I go,
what you intend to do: it would be a
ſtill greater to know that you deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
to remain at leaſt this ſummer at
Alveſtone: but you are now with a
moſt excellent man, who is capable of
adviſing you: in him, Celeſtina, you
will have a friend and protector.</p>
                  <p>Oh! why is it my lot to refer you
to another for protection, when to be
your friend, your lover, your huſband,
was ſo lately the firſt hope, as it has
ever been the firſt with of my exiſtence.
But I am running again into uſeleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0206900202:33"/>
Celeſtina, if I ever ſeemed
worthy of your regard, give not away
haſtily thoſe affections which were
mine! If ever I can claim them again—we
may be happy; if not—but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
finiſh the ſentence—I know not
what I would write, nor am I able to
read over what I have written. May
God bleſs and protect you! Adieu,
deareſt Celeſtina!</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>GEORGE WILLOUGHBY.</signed>

               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Celeſtina read over this letter the firſt
time in ſuch perturbation, that except a
general notion that notwithſtanding Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
had <hi>involuntarily</hi> left her they
ſhould meet no more, ſhe had very little
idea of it's contents.</p>
            <p>Her's were ſenſations of anguiſh which
no appeal to friendſhip, no participation of
her ſentiments with another, could mitigate
or appeaſe. Cathcart knew no more of the
motives of Willoughby's conduct than ſhe
did herſelf; Mr. Thorold was equally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0206900202:34"/>
and to neither of them could ſhe
look for conſolation. She tried to recover
her compoſure; ſhe a ſecond time read the
letter: it grew more and more inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and after having anxiouſly waited for
it ſo many days, it's arrival ſeemed now
only either to embarraſs her with new
conjectures, or to torment her with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of his marrying Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
for to that the cloſe of the firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
evidently alluded. Nothing but the
natural ſtrength of her underſtanding could
have ſupported her under the firſt tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſenſations of redoubled conſternation
and wild conjecture, which now aſſailed
her. The longer ſhe ſtudied the letter, the
more impoſſible ſhe found any explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Willoughby's conduct: ſtill the
aſſurances of his unſhaken attachment
ſweetened the bitterneſs of her deſtiny; he
was living; he ſtill loved her; her ſituation,
therefore, however uneaſy, was not deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
and, as the firſt aſtoniſhment at the
incomprehenſible contents of a letter, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0206900202:35"/>
was expected to clear up every doubt,
ſubſided, ſhe ſaw leſs cauſe of deſpondence,
and again ſhe examined every ſeparate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph,
trying to extract from all that
would bear it, ſomething to cheriſh that
hope, without which her exiſtence would
have been inſupportable.</p>
            <p>Every requeſt of Willoughby had with
her the force of a command; but that he
made in regard to her continuing at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtone
was ſo worded, as if he hardly
himſelf thought ſhe ought to comply with
it. The impropriety of it appeared evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
but in every other inſtance ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to be governed by his wiſhes,
and as far as was now in her power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to his ſatisfaction by affording him
all the conſolation that depended upon
her. Of the pleaſure of living for a
beloved object, though perhaps perſonally
diſunited for ever, of believing that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was, her eaſe and happineſs were
ever in his thoughts, ſhe was fully ſenſible;
and ſhe now found in it a conſolation ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0206900202:36"/>
ſoothing to her mind, that ſhe was ſoon
enabled to return to Cathcart, who waited
for her in the parlour, with more compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
than on her leaving him it was likely
ſhe would ſoon obtain. She found herſelf
unequal to entering on a diſcuſſion of the
letter, which ſhe gave Cathcart to read;
and on his returning it in ſilence, but with
a look ſufficiently expreſſive of his aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
ſhe told him, that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
but for them to fulfil as nearly as
poſſible all the injunctions of Willoughby.
"He deſires me not to write to him," ſaid
ſhe. "Even in that I ſhall, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
reluctance, obey him at preſent, and
ſo I certainly ſhall in what relates to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the advice of Mr. Thorold. A
little time will be neceſſary before I can
fix on any plan of life: but as my dear
Willoughby expects to hear of me from
you, tell him that I bear our ſeparation,
cruel as it is, with fortitude and calmneſs,
convinced as I am that our connection is
not broken by any cauſe that ought to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0206900202:37"/>
make me bluſh that it had ever been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended."
She ſtopped a moment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
her voice, which faultered and almoſt
failed, and then added—"No, Cathcart,
whatever has divided us, I have the firmeſt
reliance on Willoughby's honour."</p>
            <p>"And on his love," ſaid Cathcart,
"you may, dear Madam, with equal
firmneſs rely: and though theſe perfect
convictions render this ſtrange ſeparation
more wonderful, they will I truſt ſuſtain
your courage through it—I ſay through
it, becauſe I am almoſt certain it will be
of no long duration."</p>
            <p>"Ah! Cathcart!" cried Celeſtina
mournfully, "I would I could think ſo!
But it is indeed very fruitleſs and very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to enter again on theſe bewildering
conjectures, in which, as there is no end,
there is little uſe: and I have need of all
my ſpirits to enable me to ſupport an evil,
for which I cannot account; I will not
therefore waſte them in gueſſing or lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but employ them to obey him to whom
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0206900202:38"/>
my heart muſt, in every change of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and though I were certain never
more to ſee him, be fondly and faithfully
devoted. Tell him ſo, my good friend:
tell him how well I bear this ſevere blow,
more ſevere as coming from an unknown
hand; and aſſure him that if he will allow
me to write to him, I will not diſtreſs him
by uſeleſs complaints, or aggravate his
ſorrow by repreſenting my own."</p>
            <p>Again ſhe ſtopped, while Cathcart ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
his admiration of her juſt and noble
reſolutions; and after a moment, finding
the exertion too much for her, ſhe added
haſtily—"tell him thus much, Cathcart,
in the letter you will of courſe write to
him this afternoon; and tell him that your
next letter ſhall inform him, if it is ſtill
uneaſy to him to receive a letter from me,
of the arrangements I will make under the
guidance of Mr. Thorold for my future
life: but ſay, that they will be ſuch as
will render his generous intentions as to
pecuniary matters needleſs. I would fain
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0206900202:39"/>
explain my thoughts in that reſpect; but
in truth I am not able juſt now. Some
hours of reflection will be neceſſary to me.
Farewel, therefore, dear Cathcart, for this
morning; I ſhall of courſe ſee you again
in a few days."</p>
            <p>Cathcart aſſured her he would be with
her again the following Friday; or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening
day, if he received any new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
from Willoughby. She then
charged him with many kind wiſhes and
remembrances to Jeſſy, who was now, he
told her, ſo confined by her grandfather
that ſhe could not get to her, and then
took his leave to return to Alveſtone, and
execute the wiſhes of Willoughby by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him a minute detail of all that had
paſſed with Celeſtina.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
            <p>MR. Thorold, who was informed that
Celeſtina had received letters from Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
felt a true friendly impatience to
know their contents: but feeling alſo how
much his lovely gueſt muſt in any event
be agitated, he not only forbore to intrude
upon her with any enquiries himſelf, but
in order that ſhe might not ſuffer even
from the looks of his family, which he
knew could not fail to expreſs ſolicitude
ariſing from leſs generous motives, he ſent
her up a note to her own apartment, in
which he begged ſhe would not come
down to dinner, to put herſelf, through
form, into any ſituation that might be in
any degree painful. This exemption was
particularly gratifying to her, as the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0206900202:41"/>
younger Thorold was this day expected at
dinner, and was to remain at home for
ſome weeks; and his elder brother, a
Captain in the army, who had been ſome
time in Ireland, was to meet him in the
evening. Celeſtina was unfit for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and above all, the company of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and again ſhe regretted that in the
firſt unſettled tumult of her ſpirits ſhe had
agreed to Mr. Thorold's propoſal, inſtead
of going back to the lodgings ſhe had
formerly inhabited: ſhe was now, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
compelled to remain where ſhe was,
till ſhe could determine, with the advice
of Mr. Thorold, whither to go. She
thought it probable that he might wiſh
her to remain with him; but to this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
his friendly regard for her, and the
advantage of being near Cathcart and
Jeſſy, ſhe had no inducement; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhe was, ſhe determined it ſhould not
be as a mere viſitor for any length of time,
but that ſhe would pay for her board.
Again the quiet and liberty of her cottage
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0206900202:42"/>
on the heath recurred to her; but when
ſhe enjoyed that quiet, her heart had not
undergone thoſe viciſſitudes of happineſs
and miſery, which had now, ſhe greatly
feared, excluded tranquillity from her
boſom for ever; what had then afforded
her a ſpecies of melancholy pleaſure, the
diſtant view of a ſpot in Alveſtone Park,
would now ſerve only to render her more
unhappy, and to encourage that tendency
to repine, which her reaſon told her ſhe
ſhould, both on Willoughby's account and
her own, rather reſolve to conquer than
endeavour to indulge: ſhe believed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that if once ſome reſolution was
formed as to her future reſidence, ſhe
ſhould be eaſier herſelf, and be better
able to ſatisfy Willoughby. To this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
therefore, ſhe turned her thoughts,
and examined with a heavy heart ſeveral
different plans that offered themſelves to
her mind.</p>
            <p>Nothing could be more comfortleſs than
her reflections: ſhe was not only an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0206900202:43"/>
and a ſtranger in England, but
knew not whether there was in the world
any being whoſe protection ſhe had the
remoteſt right to claim. Lady Molyneux
had never written to her ſince their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and even if Willoughby ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of her again ſeeking the protection
of his ſiſter, which ſhe had great reaſon to
doubt, ſhe knew not whether Matilda and
her huſband would receive her; and from
that want of heart ſhe had too often diſcovered
in them both, ſhe could not think
of making the experiment. She had no
intimacy with any other perſon; for though
many of the families ſhe had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
to viſit while Mrs. Willoughby
lived, had daughters, who had cultivated
an acquaintance with her, ſhe had already
ſeen enough of the general conduct of the
world to know that ſhe ſhould now be no
longer an acceptable gueſt, and that an
individual to whom court is made aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
while ſhining as an equal among
faſhionable circles, is ſoon forgotten; or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0206900202:44"/>
if remembered, deſpiſed, when thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious
advantages ſurround her no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
She had heard from Vavaſour, for
Willoughby himſelf had always carefully
avoided the ſubject, that the ſudden deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Miſs Fitz-Hayman, to whom Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
was ſuppoſed to be ſo firmly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
and his reſolution of marrying his
mother's adopted daughter, had been very
much talked of in the extenſive circle who
were connected or acquainted with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
ſhe could not doubt but that their
ſudden ſeparation on the very eve of their
marriage was as generally known; and had
ſhe found any temptation to return to the
ſociety ſhe had quitted, this painful cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
the prying curioſity that would be
excited, and the malicious conjecture that
would be made, would effectually have
counteracted it.</p>
            <p>Towards evening ſhe found ſufficient
courage to entreat Mr. Thorold's attention
for half an hour. He came to her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0206900202:45"/>
and ſhe put into his hands the
letter ſhe had received from Willoughby.</p>
            <p>He read it with great attention, and as
it ſhould ſeem with great concern, and
then, in the expreſſive manner that was
uſual with him, gave it back to her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>Benevolence and pity were now viſible
in his features, which were maſculine,
ſtrong, and frequently ſtern; but Celeſtina
was hardly enough accuſtomed to him to
underſtand his ſilence completely. "You
ſee, dear Sir," ſaid ſhe timidly—"you
ſee that Willoughby refers me to you, and
I would very fain avail myſelf of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of your advice."</p>
            <p>"It is always at your ſervice," replied
Mr. Thorold; "but on what occaſion do
you now aſk it?"</p>
            <p>"I wiſh to know," replied ſhe with
ſtill greater heſitation, "what you think
it adviſable for me to do? where you think
I ought to ſettle myſelf?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0206900202:46"/>
"I am ſorry," anſwered he, "you
think it ſo ſoon neceſſary to turn your
thoughts that way. I hoped that you
would ſtay here at leaſt for ſome weeks;
and really I can give you no other advice
than to do ſo. The myſtery which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
develope, may by that time be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and we ſhall have time not only
to hear more of Willoughby, but if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
occurs on his part to re-eſtabliſh you
at Alveſtone, to caſt about for a proper
and permanent ſituation for you: think no
more, therefore, my dear ward, for ſuch
I conſider you, of leaving us at preſent,
and rather exert your admirable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in quieting your ſpirits, and in
acquiring fortitude to bear adverſity and
evil, if they ſhould be finally your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
or equality of temper to enjoy, what
it is more difficult to enjoy well—happineſs
and proſperity"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina would now liave ſpoken of the
inconvenience to which ſo long a viſit
might put his family, and the little claim
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0206900202:47"/>
ſhe had to ſuch unuſual kindneſs from him
and Mrs. Thorold; but he ſuffered her
not to continue theſe apologies, ſeemed
little pleaſed that ſhe attempted to make
them; and then re-aſſuming his good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
he left her, bidding her try to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
her looks, and to diſmiſs as much
as ſhe could from her mind the diſtreſſing
events of the laſt ten days.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina now found that ſhe could not
immediately remove without offending the
friend to whom Willoughby had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
her, and prepared, ſince ſhe could
not be indulged with ſolitude, to mix with
his family, and be as little as poſſible a
weight on thoſe, who, whatever might
be their good humour, could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to enter into her ſorrows; the next
morning therefore at breakfaſt ſhe joined
Mrs. Thorold, her daughter, and her two
ſons, to both of whom ſhe was immediately
introduced, and from whoſe ſcrutinizing
looks ſhe ſought refuge in talking with
forced cheerfulneſs to Arabella.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0206900202:48"/>
Captain Thorold was the eldeſt of the
family, and Montague the youngeſt.
The former of theſe young men had been
adopted by his uncle, who, after a life
paſſed in the army, had died a general
officer at a very advanced age, and had
left his nephew his whole fortune, which
was near fifteen hundred a year, after the
death of his wife, who ſurviving him
only a twelvemonth, Captain Thorold had
now been ſome time in poſſeſſion of his
eſtate, and of a conſiderable ſum of money.</p>
            <p>But accuſtomed from his infancy to the
unſettled life of a ſoldier, he ſtill continued
it from habit and choice; and though his
father and his family were very ſolicitous
to have him marry and ſettle near them,
he ſeemed to have no inclination to reſign
his freedom for the pleaſures of domeſtic
ſociety. Novelty and amuſement were
his purſuits, and his fortune gave him the
power to indulge himſelf. He had what
is generally called a very handſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but without his military air, his figure
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0206900202:49"/>
would have been rather eſteemed clumſy
than graceful. He had lived much among
the circles who give the ton, dreſſed well,
and had that ſort of underſtanding which
recommended him to general ſociety, and
particularly to that of the ladies, with
whom he was an almoſt univerſal favourite,
and who had agreed to call him the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Thorold, even before he became
poſſeſſed of a fortune, which in the opinion
of moſt of the belles at country quarters,
and ſtill more in the opinion of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
more than redoubled his attractions.
Thus ſpoiled from his firſt entrance into
life, he had learned to conſider himſelf as
irreſiſtible, and ſuppoſed every woman he
ſaw his own, if he choſe to take the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ſecuring her.</p>
            <p>His air and manner were tinctured with
the conſequence he derived from this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion;
and from having indulged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the cruel vanity of extenſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
he was incapable of any laſting or
ſerious attachment. At the firſt public
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0206900202:50"/>
meeting at any town he happened to be
quartered at, he elected ſome goddeſs of
the day; with her he danced, he walked,
he rode, he coquetted; and by ſtudied
looks, and tender ſpeeches, ſoon perſuaded
the inexperienced girl that ſhe had ſecured
in her chains the handſome Thorold.
The deluſion of the young woman herſelf,
and the envy of the cotemporary belles,
ſometimes laſted till the removal of the
corps to another ſtation: when he took a
cold farewel, and left her to ſuffer all the
pain of diſappointed love and mortified
vanity: but he not unfrequently indulged
himſelf in witneſſing the diſtreſs this wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
folly inflicted; and after ſome days of
attention ſo marked and unequivocal as to
give the lady reaſon to ſuppoſe an abſolute
declaration of his paſſion was certainly to
be expected, he ſuddenly broke off the
acquaintance, pretended to forget their
intimacy, bowed to her when they met
with the air of a ſtranger, and beginning
the ſame career with ſome other pretty girl
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0206900202:51"/>
of the place, he affected to treat with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
and wonder the reports he had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
raiſed of his permanent attachment to
the firſt lady, and laughed with her rival
at the melancholy moping looks, or glances
of angry diſappointment, of the deſerted
beauty, declaring himſelf amazed at her
having the vanity to ſuppoſe him ſerious,
becauſe he had ſhewn her a few trifling at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
which meant nothing.</p>
            <p>This conduct of his ſon had given Mr.
Thorold great uneaſineſs a few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but lately, as he had been in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and in very diſtant quarters, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had heard no more of it, and flattered
himſelf that now, at near thirty, this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled
temper and unjuſtifiable levity would
end in his marrying and quitting the army.
But though a very fond father to all his
children, Mr. Thorold loved the Captain
leſs than the others; partly perhaps becauſe
he was ſo early removed from him, and
rendered independent of his care, and
partly becauſe his temper and diſpoſition
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0206900202:52"/>
reſembled not his own; while Mrs. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold
doated on her eldeſt ſon, whoſe figure
and fortune gratified her vanity, and whom
ſhe thought no young woman could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
deſerve, unleſs ſhe poſſeſſed at once
fortune, beauty, and faſhion.</p>
            <p>Montague Thorold, who was but juſt
turned of one and twenty, and was deſigned
by his father for the church, was as modeſt
and unaſſuming as his brother was arrogant
and pretending. He was a very good
ſcholar, with a paſſion for poetry, and was
juſt of the age to be in love with every
handſome woman he ſaw; and without
having the courage to ſpeak to any of them
in proſe, he celebrated his divinities in
verſe, and ſighed forth his tender ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in ſonnets and elegies, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
the magazines, and now and then
the public prints, under the fictitious names
of Alphonſo or Lyſimachus.</p>
            <p>Such were the two young men who were
now added to the tea table of Mrs. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
where all the family were aſſembled
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0206900202:53"/>
except Mr. Thorold himſelf, who always
breakfaſted early and then went out to his
farm or among his pariſhioners.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Thorold had told her ſons that a
young lady was viſiting at the houſe, whoſe
hiſtory ſhe had given them in ſhort hand,
deſcribing her as a dependant on the late
Mrs. Willoughby, whom her ſon had very
ſimply intended to marry at Alveſtone;
but the evening before the appointed wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
day had broken off the match, from
prudential motives as ſhe ſuppoſed, and by
the advice of ſome of his friends who had
come down from London.</p>
            <p>This was the idea Mrs. Thorold had her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
conceived of the affair, and ſhe had no
means of being undeceived; for Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
who knew that with her a command
was better than an argument, and whoſe
authority was pretty firmly eſtabliſhed, had
ordered her poſitively to aſk no queſtions
of his gueſt, and had peremptorily refuſed
to anſwer thoſe ſhe put to himſelf. She
obeyed, but not without many murmurs;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0206900202:54"/>
but knowing that Mr. Thorold would be
much diſobliged by her refuſal to entertain
Celeſtina with kindneſs, had put a reſtraint
upon herſelf, and ſhewed her hitherto much
civility, though not without many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to Arabella, when they were alone,
of her father's abſurdity in forcing people
into the family, and refuſing even to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
her who and what they were, or what
claim they had to the kindneſs he exacted
for them.</p>
            <p>From his mother's ſketch of their viſitor
the evening before, Captain Thorold had
very little curioſity to ſee her; and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,
whoſe heart was in one of it's moſt
violent paroxiſms of love for the fair
daughter of an attorney at Henly, with
whom he became acquainted about a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
before, was occupied in compoſing
an elegy on abſence, and thought he could
with indifference have beheld at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
Helen herſelf: he had enquired of
his mother and ſiſter if their gueſt was
handſome: Mrs. Thorold anſwered—"No,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0206900202:55"/>
not at all handſome in my opinion;" and
Arabella ſaid—"Yes, ſurely, Mama, ſhe
is rather pretty-iſh."</p>
            <p>On her entering the room, however, both
the gentlemen were inſtantly of an opinion
very different from that of their mother and
their ſiſter: yet Celeſtina had not now that
dazzling complexion, or that animated coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
which were once ſo dangerous to
behold; ſhe was pale and languid; her
eyes had all their ſoftneſs, but their luſtre
was diminiſhed; and the enchanting ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which uſed to play about her mouth
was now ſupplied by a melancholy ſmile,
the effect of a faint effort to conceal the
anguiſh of the heart.</p>
            <p>Such as ſhe now appeared, however,
the Captain thought her very lovely; and
Montague almoſt inſtantly forgot the
nymph for whom he had been dying in
ſong all the morning, and ſaw in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting
languor of Celeſtina—in her faded
cheek, and downcaſt eyes, a ſentimental
effect, which none of the fair creatures
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0206900202:56"/>
whom he had celebrated had ever ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
poſſeſſed: but if ſuch were his
ſentiments before ſhe ſpoke, his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
aroſe to extravagance, when, after
breakfaſt, his ſiſter engaged her in a walk
in which the two gentlemen attended
them, and when he found that her mind
correſponded with the elegance of her
form; that ſhe was very well read, had a
taſte for poetry, and underſtood Italian, of
which he was enthuſiaſtically fond. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Thorold, on whom theſe advantages
made leſs impreſſion, was not quite pleaſed
during this walk with the unuſual talkative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his brother, who generally ſuffered
him to take the lead in converſation. He
now attempted to put by him two or three
times, and to relate anecdotes of people in
high life: of what General Wallace ſaid
to him at Dublin Caſtle upon his intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to the Ducheſs of—, and of a
bon mot of Lady Mary Marſden's at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
one evening; but Celeſtina, who cared
nothing about the General, the Ducheſs,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0206900202:57"/>
or Lady Mary, let the converſation drop
without expreſſing any pleaſure in it, and
again lent her attention to Montague, who
deſired her to correct his accent while he
repeated—
<q>O primavera, gioventu dell' anno—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Celeſtina modeſtly aſſured him ſhe was
incapable of correcting him; but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
her ſo earneſtly to recite the lines
to him, that ſhe inconſiderately attempted
it, and in the moſt enchanting accents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan—
<q>
                  <l>O primavera gioventu dell' anno,</l>
                  <l>Bella madre di fiori</l>
                  <l>D'erbe novelle e di novelli amori:</l>
                  <l>Tu torni ben—ma teco</l>
                  <l>Non tornano i ſereni</l>
                  <l>E fortunati di delle mie gioje:</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The cruel remembrance that now preſſed
upon her heart made her voice tremble,
and gave it additional tenderneſs. She
tried to recover it; and going into a lower
tone, went on with—
<q>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0206900202:58"/>
                  <l>Tu torni ben—tu torni</l>
                  <l>Ma teco altro no torna</l>
                  <l>Che del perduto mio caro teſoro</l>
                  <l>Lo rimembranza miſera e dolente.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>She could go no farther: the tears were
in her eyes; but ſhe tried to ſmile, and to
ſtifle the deep ſigh that was riſing as ſhe
ſaid—"I cannot go on, for really I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
no more."</p>
            <p>The young man, faſcinated by her
manner and her voice, now recollected—with
reluctance recollected, that theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
tones were drawn forth by the
reality of thoſe ſufferings the poet deſcribed.
He looked at her in ſilence; and as he
marked the ſad and penſive expreſſion that
remained on her countenance, that aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
which he had hardly time to
feel before, aroſe: he thought it impoſſible
that Mr. Willoughby, having the power
to marry ſuch a woman, and having once
formed the reſolution to do ſo, ſhould by
any perſuaſions be diverted from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
and he found that in the ſingle hour
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0206900202:59"/>
he had been with her, he admired her
enough to ſacrifice every thing to her,
were it poſſible that her regard could be
transferred to him. The improbability
that it ever could, ſtruck him forcibly,
and rendered him as ſilent as Celeſtina
herſelf; while the Captain, who had now
an opportunity of engroſſing her attention,
rallied her on being ſo much affected.
"I have no notion now," ſaid he, "of
giving way to thoſe ſort of things. I love
gay and cheerful poetry. One is tired of
weeping at the fictitious miſery of fictitious
perſons. I remember being ſome time
ago at a converſation in Dublin, where we
talked of the faſhionable indifference which
every body has now for tragedy; and my
friend Hargrave, who has written, you
know, ſeveral things himſelf, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
it as the certain marks of the
vitiated taſte and imbecility of the age:
I took up the argument on the other ſide;
and Lady Mary Marſden thought as I
did. Indeed every body preſent allowed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0206900202:60"/>
that it was quite abſurd to go to a play,
which is intended to amuſe and entertain,
only to be made uneaſy. She agreed with
me that people have concern enough in
real life, and need not go ſeek it in way of
diverſion."</p>
            <p>"And did her Ladyſhip," enquired
Montague Thorold, "give no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?"</p>
            <p>"I think thoſe are very good reaſons,"
replied the Captain.</p>
            <p>"They might be ſo," anſwered his
brother, "for a woman of faſhion; but I
am perſuaded literary people and people of
taſte think quite otherwiſe; and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
whoſe ſuperior intellectual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
are not to be diſputed—"</p>
            <p>"Oh prithee Montague," interrupted
the Captain, "don't run us down with
college cant. I am talking of the world
we live in; and the opinions of people
who lived two thouſand years ago are no
more in queſtion now than their dreſſes."
He then went on to retail other opinions
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0206900202:61"/>
of Lady Mary Marſden, who was, as it
ſeemed, the oracle of the hour in the ſociety
he had juſt left. Celeſtina heard him
with apparent attention, but in truth without
knowing what he ſaid; his brother,
rendered impatient by being interrupted
in his converſation with her, walked away;
and Arabella, who loved to hear deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of fine people, and to attend to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable
converſation, kept up the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
till the end of their walk; when
Celeſtina went to her own room, Arabella
to her dreſſing table, and the Captain,
finding his mother at work in the parlour,
thought he had a right to aſk her a few
queſtions about Celeſtina, in return for the
perpetual tone of interrogation ſhe had
kept up towards him ever ſince his arrival.</p>
            <p>To Mrs. Thorold, the next gratification
to that of aſking queſtions was the pleaſure
of anſwering them: ſhe told her ſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
not only all ſhe knew, but invented
anſwers on ſome points which ſhe only
gueſſed at; and he underſtood, from her
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0206900202:62"/>
information, that Celeſtina had been very
partial to Willoughby; and ſo ſtrong was
this partiality deſcribed, that he began to
doubt whether the propoſed marriage had
not been a mere fineſſe to throw her off
her guard, and get her wholly into his
power; and whether his abrupt departure
had not been in conſequence of the ſucceſs
of this diſingenuous but not unprecedented
method of proceeding.</p>
            <p>Captain Thorold had ſeen Willoughby
frequently in his laſt viſit at home, and
knew that he had every advantage which a
fine perſon and engaging manners could
give him; he was well acquainted with
the ſociety among which he lived, and had
heard ſome of them, but particularly Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,
deſcribed as being very gay and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled;
he had therefore little difficulty
in ſuppoſing that Willoughby reſembled
thoſe with whom he aſſociated, and that
Celeſtina had been the victim of thoſe arts
which he ſuppoſed no man ever ſcrupled
to practice where the object was ſo well
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0206900202:63"/>
worth the trouble; eſpecially one ſo unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
as ſhe was, where no rigid father
was in the way to obſtruct their deſigns,
or Chamont-like brother to avenge the
wrong they might commit. Willoughby
now, however, ſeemed quite out of the
queſtion; and he doubted not, but that
after a ſhort interval given to ſentimental
regret on the loſs of a firſt lover, ſhe would
liſten to other vows, and encourage the
paſſion, which he thought it might be
very amuſing to entertain her with, without
meaning however to offer himſelf to fill
ſuch engagements as Willoughby had
broken. While he meditated on this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
he could not help ſmiling at the culli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of his father, who had thus, he
thought, taken into his protection, and
made the companion of his wife and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the deſerted miſtreſs of Willoughby.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
            <p>THE following morning Cathcart was
early at the houſe of Mr. Thorold; and
Celeſtina, who roſe now earlier than uſual,
(to enjoy, if it could be called enjoyment,
a few hours, before ſhe was compelled to
hide her ſorrows under the appearance of
attention to the family ſhe was with) met
him as he came from the ſtable; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of going into the houſe, ſhe deſired
he would walk with her towards the village.
"You have news for me," ſaid ſhe;
"but if I may gueſs by your countenance
none that will relieve the weight I feel on
my heart."</p>
            <p>"I am afraid not," replied he: "yet
indeed I have nothing to ſay that ſhould
encreaſe it. Mr. Willoughby is well; he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0206900202:65"/>
writes to me with more cheerfulneſs than
I expected, and aſſures me that he has a
long letter for you, which he ſhall ſend
from Dover, where he ſhall finiſh it."</p>
            <p>"From Dover! He is then ſet out on
this expedition. Ah! Cathcart! and ought
not ſuch intelligence to add to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern?"</p>
            <p>"Not at all," replied Cathcart. "You
knew before that it was his intention; and
he tells me that on the event of this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
depends his ever ſeeing Alveſtone
again. There is certainly a chance of it's
terminating favourably: at all events, if
this abſence is to end your ſuſpenſe, you
ſhould not only ſubmit to it, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
my dear Miſs De Mornay, to keep
up both your health and ſpirits."</p>
            <p>"Alas! Cathcart," anſwered Celeſtina,
"there is nothing ſo eaſy to the happy as
to give ſuch advice, nothing ſo difficult
to the wretched as to take it." She then
enquired into the other particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in Willoughby's letter; and after
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0206900202:66"/>
informing herſelf of the day when he expected
to be at Dover, and how long it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be before ſhe ſhould receive the letter
he promiſed her, ſhe turned the converſation
on Jeſſy, whom ſhe expreſſed an eager wiſh
to ſee: and ſoon after Montague Thorold,
who impatiently watched her wherever ſhe
went, came to tell her that his mother
waited breakfaſt for her.</p>
            <p>Cathcart, however, declined the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to breakfaſt with them, and wiſhing
Celeſtina a good morning, and promiſing
to be with her again in a day or two, he
went in ſearch of Mr. Thorold, with whom
he ſaid he had ſome buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Many ſucceeding days paſſed without
any intereſting event. The Captain took
every occaſion to impreſs on Celeſtina an
idea of his conſequence, and the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſtyle he lived in, to which ſhe gave
very little attention; while his brother,
whenever he left him an opportunity,
talked to her of books, or read to her
paſſages in favourite authors of which he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0206900202:67"/>
heard her expreſs approbation: ſhe was
prevailed upon to ſing duets with Arabella;
and he was enchanted with her voice and
manner; ſhe ſat down to draw the flowers
he gathered for her, while he hung over her
in raptures, or held her pallet, or read a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical
deſcription of the plants ſhe was paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Captain Thorold rode out occaſionally
to viſit ſuch of the neighbouring families as
he conſidered worth his attention; Arabella
was often of his party, and Mrs. Thorold
engaged in domeſtic concerns; and then
if Celeſtina could not eſcape to her own
room before Montague, who was always
upon the watch for her, could interrupt
her, he entreated her ſo earneſtly to walk
with him, was ſo obligingly ſolicitous to
pleaſe her, and ſeemed ſo mortified when
ſhe attempted to excuſe herſelf, that ſhe
could ſeldom reſolve to refuſe him her
converſation, even when ſhe was moſt
willing to be alone; and in the ſimilarity
of their taſtes and ſtudies, and in the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
though ſilent ſympathy he appeared
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0206900202:68"/>
to feel for her ſorrows, there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſoothing to her ſick heart, which
rejected every idea of love but for Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby:
conſcious of which, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that no man could conſider her other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than as deſtined to be his wife, or to
die unmarried, ſhe dreamed not that ſhe
was granting to young Thorold indulgence
fatal to his repoſe.</p>
            <p>He was himſelf ſoon aware of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but he courted it; and though he
underſtood that the heart of Celeſtina was
engaged, he fancied, that without any
pretenſions to her love, he ſhould be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
in being admitted to her friendſhip,
than the unrivalled affections of any other
woman could make him. He was too
artleſs, and too proud of his judgment, to
attempt to conceal this attachment from his
father, who, had Celeſtina been diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
would have preferred her, with
her ſmall fortune and uncertain birth, to
the richeſt heireſs in the county: but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how ſhe was circumſtanced, he ſaw
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0206900202:69"/>
his younger ſon's encreaſing partiality with
ſome concern, and took an opportunity,
when they were alone, to tell him the real
circumſtances of Celeſtina in regard to
Willoughby. "I can conſider her," ſaid
he, "no otherwiſe than his affianced wife.
They are parted by ſome cauſe of which I
am ignorant, but which will probably be
removed: in the mean time her youth and
beauty render her ſituation very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
as from her being a foreigner, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan,
and probably the natural daughter
of ſome perſon of high faſhion in France,
who has taken care to deſtroy all evidence
of her real family, ſhe is without relations
and without protection. Willoughby's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was my old friend. When I was an
indigent curate he gave me a living, which,
though I have now, from being poſſeſſed
of greater preferment, reſigned, I conſider
as my firſt ſtep towards affluence. I am
therefore, bound to the family by grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and to young Willoughby I am
bound by perſonal friendſhip and eſteem.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0206900202:70"/>
Except ſomething too much bordering on
raſhneſs in his temper, I hardly know any
man ſo faultleſs and ſo worthy of regard.
He adores Miſs De Mornay, and I am
convinced the happineſs of his life depends
on their union. Finding him torn from
her for the preſent, at the very moment
this union was to take place, I entered at
once into all the uneaſineſs that muſt have
aſſailed him, and I voluntarily offered my
protection to her, which he has ſince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
in a letter to me to be the
greateſt kindneſs he could receive. I have
promiſed him to continue it as long as
ſhe has occaſion for it or will accept it. Do
not, therefore, Montague, by any of your
excentricities, make this uneaſy either to
her or to me. Don't fancy yourſelf in
love with a young woman who is in fact
married. Any other kind of attention or
regard you ſhew her will oblige me; but
let us have no making love, unleſs you
would drive her away and greatly diſoblige
me."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0206900202:71"/>
The young man readily promiſed what
at the moment he was ſincere in, that he
would not make love to Celeſtina; but he
did not promiſe not to feel the paſſion,
againſt which it was too late already to
guard him. Mr. Thorold however ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that after this explanation there was
nothing to fear from the extreme ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of his younger ſon; and for the eldeſt,
he was too certain that he had not a heart
on which the charms and virtues of Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
or of any other beautiful and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
woman, could make any permanent
impreſſion. He was eaſy therefore in a
ſituation which would have made many
narrow minded and ſelfiſh parents very
much otherwiſe; and did not think the
preſence of his two ſons at home, a ſufficient
reaſon for withdrawing his generous kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
from Celeſtina, to whom he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
affectionately attached for her own
ſake, to whom he loved to conſider himſelf
as a guardian and protector.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0206900202:72"/>
Mrs. Thorold, always buſied about the
intrigues and ſchemes of the reſt of the
world, ſaw not very minutely into thoſe of
her own family. As to her eldeſt ſon, ſhe
contemplated him as a ſuperior being, who
had a right to marry the greateſt heireſs of
the kingdom. She heard him ſpeak ſo
often of Lady Marys and Lady Carolines,
that ſhe concluded he might have any of
them whenever he pleaſed; and had ſet
her imagination ſo high as to his merits and
his fortune, that ſhe never ſuppoſed he
could think of bringing her any other than
a titled daughter in law. Celeſtina, whom
ſhe looked upon as a creature whoſe title
to reſpect was very queſtionable, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
from her birth, and now little
better than a dependant on herſelf, was
not a perſon likely to make any impreſſion
on Captain Thorold; and the prejudice
operated on her perſon and her manners.
Mrs. Thorold could not ſee that ſhe was
handſome, or feel that ſhe was intereſting;
and when the attention of young Thorold
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0206900202:73"/>
was very ſtrongly marked towards her,
his mother only ridiculed him, telling him
that he was never eaſy but when playing
the Philander, and that he cared not with
whom.</p>
            <p>Nothing, therefore, interrupted the
progreſs of that ſerious paſſion, which
Montague Thorold determined to indulge,
and of which Celeſtina was perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious.
The more unreſerved ſlattery
and free addreſs of the Captain ſhe knew
how to repreſs; and received all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
with ſo much coldneſs, that his
pride was piqued; and unuſed to the
ſlighteſt repulſe, he determined not to
brook it from one, who had, in his private
opinion, very little right to aſſume dignity
or affect diſdain.</p>
            <p>The manner he took up towards her in
conſequence of theſe opinions, was ſo very
diſagreeable to her, that it forced her more
than ever into the ſociety of his brother;
before whom, though the Captain held
him very cheap as a boy and a pedant, he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0206900202:74"/>
could not well addreſs to her ſuch ſpeeches
as he had ventured to utter ſeveral times
when he ſeized an opportunity of ſpeaking
to her alone, or unheard by the reſt of the
family. Whenever, therefore, ſhe was
compelled to be below, ſhe contrived to
have Montague Thorold ſit next to her, to
accept his arm as they walked, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
her diſcourſe to him: and flattered by
this evident preference, he let no occaſion
paſs of proving how happy it made him.</p>
            <p>So paſſed heavily for Celeſtina, the days
that intervened between that when ſhe laſt
ſaw Cathcart, and that on which ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Willoughby's letter from Dover.
The day arrived at length; and Celeſtina,
who happened to be ſitting with Arabella
and her brothers when the letters were
brought, could hardly ſupport herſelf
while the Captain took them from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and reading the direction of each,
threw them acroſs the table, now one to
his ſiſter, now one to his brother, and bade
Montague carry a third to his father.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0206900202:75"/>
There was none for Celeſtina, though
Cathcart had told her it would be directed
to her at the houſe of Mr. Thorold. Of
this bitter diſappointment, however, ſhe
ſpoke not, but tried to conceal the change
it occaſioned in her countenance, and
haſtened, as ſoon as ſhe could, to weep
alone, over the ſad idea that Willoughby's
diminiſhed, perhaps annihilated love, had
allowed him to torture her with ſuſpenſe
which he might ſo eaſily have avoided by
punctuality.</p>
            <p>Another almoſt ſleepleſs night was the
conſequence of this delay: but though
without reſt in the night, Celeſtina roſe as
ſoon as day appeared. At no other time
but early in the morning ſhe had now any
chance of being alone either in the garden
or the neighbouring fields, and the air
ſeemed neceſſary to her overburthened
ſpirits. In the fields, ſhe ſeemed to breathe
more freely, and her heart, which often
felt as if it would burſt, was relieved while
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0206900202:76"/>
ſhe was allowed to weep unmarked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted.</p>
            <p>A narrow road, ſhaded by thick rows
of branching elms, led towards the village,
which was that way almoſt a mile from
the houſe of Mr. Thorold, who did not
inhabit the parſonage but an houſe he had
built on a farm of his own. Celeſtina, to
avoid being ſeen from the windows of the
houſe, which commanded the garden and
the meadows near it, took her way down
this lane. Her thoughts ran over the
ſtrange events of the preceding years, in
which ſhe had experienced ſo much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
anguiſh embittered by the tranſient
promiſe of ſupreme happineſs. As ſhe
reviewed her whole life, it ſeemed to have
been productive only of regret. "Why,"
cried ſhe, "was I ever born? Alas! my
exiſtence was the occaſion of miſery to
thoſe who gave it me! Why did deareſt
Mrs. Willoughby take me from a confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
where I was dead to the world, and
where perhaps neglect and hardſhip might
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0206900202:77"/>
long ſince have releaſed me? What will
now become of me? If Willoughby for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
me, how ſhall I find courage to drag
about a wretched being? uſeful to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,
for whom nobody is intereſted, and
which ſeems marked by heaven for cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity!"</p>
            <p>Theſe melancholy reflections led her on,
till a turn out of the road brought her to
the ſtyle of the church yard. She leant
penſively over it, and read the ruſtic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
on the tomb ſtones. One was
that of a young woman of nineteen: it was
her own age; and Celeſtina felt an emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of envy towards the village girl, whoſe
early death the rural poet lamented in the
inſcription. "Merciful heaven!" cried
ſhe, "is early death ever really to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented?
and ſhould I not be happier to
die now than to live; as perhaps I ſhall to
be forgotten?" Inſenſibly this idea took
poſſeſſion of her fancy; and with her pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
ſhe wrote the following lines in her
pocket book, not without ſome recollection
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0206900202:78"/>
of Edwards's thirty ſeventh and forty fourth
ſonnets:</p>
            <q>

                  <l>And mine, thy calm and enviable reſt.</l>

                  <l>Thy form and virtues from the ſilent grave!</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Celeſtina, who had a natural turn to
poetry, had very rarely indulged it; but
ſince ſhe had paſſed ſo many hours with
Willoughby, his paſſionate fondneſs for it,
and his deſire that ſhe ſhould not neglect
the talent ſhe had received from nature,
had turned her thoughts to it's cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and now almoſt the firſt uſe ſhe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0206900202:79"/>
made of it was to lament that ſhe lived,
ſince none of her acquirements were to
pleaſe him, for whom alone ſhe wiſhed to
poſſeſs either life or talents.</p>
            <p>She had finiſhed her ſonnet, and read it
over aloud: ſhe changed a word or two,
again read it, and was putting it into her
pocket book, when ſhe was ſtartled by the
ſight of Montague Thorold, who appeared
behind her, though ſhe had not heard
him approach. "Do not," he cried, "be
offended, deareſt Miſs De Mornay, if I
thus break in upon your ſolitude; and do
not," continued he, taking her hand, in
which ſhe ſtill held the pocket book—"do
not puniſh me by putting away what
I have ſo earneſt a deſire to hear."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, half angry, replied—"I have
nothing, Sir, worth your hearing."</p>
            <p>"I have offended you," ſaid he, in the
moſt reſpectful tone—"I ſee you are
offended. If you knew my heart, you
would know how much better I could bear
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0206900202:80"/>
any misfortune than your contempt and
anger."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, whoſe ſlight diſpleaſure was
already at an end, anſwered with a ſmile,
that he certainly deſerved neither: "but
come," continued ſhe, "you were ſent I
dare ſay to call me to breakfaſt and we are
loitering here."</p>
            <p>"I was not ſent," anſwered he. "I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is yet earlier than you imagine it to
be. You are not then offended at my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
you?"</p>
            <p>"Oh no! think of it no more," ſaid
Celeſtina, wiſhing to change the diſcourſe.
"Is it not a delicious morning?"</p>
            <p>He anſwered not her queſtion; but fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his eyes on her's, ſaid—"See how
ſoon a ſecond treſpaſs is attempted when
the firſt is ſo graciouſly forgiven. <hi>May</hi> I
aſk, as the moſt ineſtimable favour, to
hear once more the lines you were reciting?"</p>
            <p>"Once more!" repeated Celeſtina.
"Have you heard them once already
then?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0206900202:81"/>
"I will ſay I have <hi>not,</hi> if my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that I have will diſpleaſe you."</p>
            <p>"I do not think," ſaid Celeſtina care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly,
"that will mend your caſe much:
but however the lines were not worth your
hearing, and—"</p>
            <p>"Every thing you even repeat from
another," cried he, eagerly interrupting
her, "is worth hearing: how much more
worth hearing, when that faſcinating voice
is employed in expreſſing the ſentiments of
that elegant and lovely mind. Oh! Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina!—But
forgive me, Madam; it is
preſumption indeed in me to addreſs you
ſo freely; yet Celeſtina is the only name
in the world that ſeems to me fit for you.
The common terms of formal civility are
unworthy of you. Let me then call you
Celeſtina, not in familiarity, but in vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
in adoration; and entreat you, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
you to oblige me."</p>
            <p>Diſconcerted at his vehemence of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and extravagance of expreſſion, Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
now thought it better to put an end to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0206900202:82"/>
ſuch very warm applications, by ſhewing
him the little value in her eyes of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
he ſolicited. She gave him the paper,
therefore, ſaying coldly—"You are anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for a very trifling matter; and as you
have already heard the lines, it is hardly
worth the time you muſt give, haſtily
written as they are, and with interlineations
and eraſures, to make them out."</p>
            <p>"Give me then time to do it," cried he,
as he kiſſed the paper and put it in his
boſom.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, more diſconcerted by his
manner than before, ſaid yet more gravely,
"I beg I may have them again imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately."</p>
            <p>"You ſhall indeed," replied Thorold;
"but I muſt firſt read them."</p>
            <p>"Read them then now," replied ſhe.</p>
            <p>"It is impoſſible," cried he, "for here
is Arabella and my brother coming to meet
us; and it is the firſt time that being with
you, I felt their interruption as a favour."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0206900202:83"/>
During this dialogue Celeſtina had
walked rather quickly towards the houſe,
ſo that they were by this time within ſight
of the garden gate, from whence Captain
and Miſs Thorold advanced ſlowly towards
them. Montague, as if conſcious of the
impropriety of what had paſſed, now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to be talking of indifferent matters;
and Celeſtina, ruffled by his wild enthuſiaſm,
and eagerly anticipating the letter which
ſhe hoped that day would bring her from
Willoughby, felt herſelf made uneaſy by
the ſteady and enquiring eyes of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
who had acquired a very rude habit
of ſtaring people out of countenance. She
was compelled however to endure it, not
only while breakfaſt laſted, but afterwards
when Arabella engaged her aſſiſtance in
painting a trimming which was to compoſe
the ornament of a gala dreſs for the balls at
Tunbridge, whither ſhe was going in June
with the eldeſt of her married ſiſters, who
was in an ill ſtate of health.</p>

            <p>ARABELLA Thorold, deſirous of
availing herſelf of the ſuperior taſte and
ſkill that Celeſtina poſſeſſed in ſuch orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
matter as ſhe was now buſy about,
the merit of which ſhe knew ſhe might,
where ſhe was going, take entirely to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
now invited her gueſt to the work
table at which ſhe was employed; Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
took up a book to read to them aloud,
while his brother ſauntered idly about the
room, now praiſing Celeſtina's performance,
now correcting that of his ſiſter; then hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a tune, looking at his watch, or
throwing about the colours or the pencils,
he ſeemed determined to interrupt his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
reading, and particularly when by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague's
voice and geſture he ſaw that he hoped
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0206900202:85"/>
particularly to intereſt and attract the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his auditors. This ſcene, of which
the painful anxiety of Celeſtina for her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
made her unuſually impatient, was at
length put an end to by the entrance of the
ſervant from the poſt, and Celeſtina re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
in trembling agitation, a letter
with the Dover poſt mark. She flew with
it to her own room, and read as follows:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                  </opener>
                  <p>The veſſel which is to carry me from
England and Celeſtina is now waiting
for me; and I have delayed writing to
her till this laſt moment; not becauſe
I have ever ceaſed to think of her with
the warmeſt ſolicitude, but becauſe I
have not till now been able to collect
courage to bid her a long adieu!</p>
                  <p>I am going, Celeſtina, to the South of
Europe. Perhaps my ſtay may be very
ſhort: perhaps I may, for the reſt of
my life, be doomed to be a ſolitary wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.
But however deſtiny may diſpoſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0206900202:86"/>
of <hi>me,</hi> let me entreat you, by all that
regard which once made the happineſs
of my life, to take care of your health;
try to regain your cheerfulneſs; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, Celeſtina, ſtrangely againſt
me as appearances are, I have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

I any wiſh ſo fervent as for your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>I cannot write to you on pecuniary
affairs. Cathcart has, in regard to every
thing of that ſort, my full directions.
Whenever he and Jeſſy become houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers
for themſelves, you will be their
welcome gueſt, and my heavy heart will
be relieved of much of it's anguiſh:
till then, I entruſt you to the care and
direction of the excellent friend you are
now with: may it not long be neceſſary
for me to—But I dare not truſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

now the meaſure I have been driven to
is adopted, I can hear from you without
fearing that my reſolution may be ſhaken.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0206900202:87"/>
Heaven bleſs and protect you, deareſt
Celeſtina! This is the firſt wiſh I form,
when, after my uneaſy ſlumber, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection

Alas! it is often only an attempt!</p>
                  <p>But there is no end of this—Farewel!

            <p>This letter was if poſſible more unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
than the laſt. No reaſon was yet
given for his having left her, no certainty
held out of his return; but all, if not hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
was ſo comfortleſs, ſo obſcure, that
her reſolution to inveſtigate the cauſe of
all that had happened, again failed. She
feared even to attempt putting aſide the
fearful veil that was drawn between them.
He was now in another country, from
whence his return ſeemed uncertain; and
ſhe ſeemed the moſt deſolate and forlorn
being that exiſted on that which he had
left. Her heart ſunk within her in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0206900202:88"/>
that ſhe might never ſee him
more; that he hardly ſeemed to wiſh ſhe
ſhould. Again ſhe read his letter over.
He was ſleepleſs, reſtleſs, unhappy; and
for his ſufferings ſhe wept more than for
her own.</p>
            <p>The plan he mentioned of her reſiding
with the Cathcarts, was the only one to
which, ſince their ſeparation, ſhe had
looked forward with any degree of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
But that there was yet little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of executing: for old Winnington
was in even better health than he had been
for ſome years; and though the tender aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity
of Jeſſy had won much even on his
inſenſible heart, he ſuffered her to have no
authority; and often being ſeized with fits
of jealouſy and ſuſpicion that ſhe went to
meet and aſſiſt her father, he would inſiſt
upon her not quitting him a moment; ſo
that ſhe had ſometimes for many days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
no opportunity of ſeeing her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and had never once, ſince her ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from Celeſtina, been able to reach
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0206900202:89"/>
her preſent abode. Celeſtina had not been
an hour alone, before Montague Thorold
tapped at her door. She dried her eyes,
and pulling her hat over them, opened it
to him.</p>
            <p>"Will you not walk," ſaid he, apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing
however for his intruſion. "I am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afraid
I diſturb you: but the morning is ſo
beautiful; and we are all going to ſee a
pond fiſhed, with two friends of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
from Exeter, who are juſt come in."</p>
            <p>"I cannot indeed," anſwered Celeſtina.
"Pray excuſe me."</p>
            <p>"I would not preſs you for the world,"
ſaid he, "to do any thing that is diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to you. But the air will be ſurely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to you. You—have been weeping,
Miſs De Mornay! and—"</p>
            <p>"If I have," replied ſhe, interrupting
him, "you may be aſſured, Sir, that I
have reaſon enough for my tears, and
would wiſh to enjoy them alone."</p>
            <p>"Precious tears!" cried he with a deep
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0206900202:90"/>
ſigh. "The letter was from the fortunate
Willoughby!"</p>
            <p>"Fortunate do you call him?" But
Celeſtina, as if offended that any tongue
but her's ſhould name him, ſtopped, and
turning from the door, went into her own
room.</p>
            <p>At this moment Arabella ran up ſtairs to
fetch her cloak and gloves, and ſeeing her
brother Montague at the door of Celeſtina's
room, cried, as ſhe paſſed him—"Hey
day! are you in waiting as Page or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
Uſher?"</p>
            <p>"As neither," anſwered he in ſome
confuſion. "I was merely aſking if Miſs
De Mornay would walk with us."</p>
            <p>"Oh! I dare ſay not," replied his ſiſter,
ſmiling maliciouſly as ſhe looked over her
ſhoulder at him—"I dare ſay not. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,
what are you in now? Are you
Romeo—"Oh! that I were a glove upon
"that hand, that I might touch that cheek!"
or are you Caſtalio?—"Sweets planted by
"the hand of heaven grow here." You al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0206900202:91"/>
make love I know by book. What!
ſhall I call Edmund to take the part of
Polydore? I think you will make it out
among you."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who had heard this ſpeech,
though it was not meant that ſhe ſhould,
was equally amazed and hurt at it. It had
however a very different effect from what
the ſpeaker intended; who having no wiſh
that Celeſtina ſhould join them, becauſe
ſhe deſired to monopolize the converſation
of the two ſtrangers, thought, by rallying
her brother, to break off his entreaty.
Montague, mild as he was, was piqued
extremely, and would reſentingly have
anſwered, if his ſiſter had not immediately
diſappeared, and if Celeſtina had not at
the ſame moment opened her door and
ſaid—"You compel me, Mr. Montague,
to walk whether I will or no."</p>
            <p>"Pray forgive me," ſaid he, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her. "I would purchaſe no pleaſure
at your expence."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0206900202:92"/>
Arabella now returning down ſtairs, was
ſurpriſed to ſee her preparing to go. "I
thought you declined walking Ma'am,"
ſaid ſhe formally. Celeſtina made an
effort to conquer the reſentment ſhe juſtly
felt, and replied coldly that the morning
was ſo pleaſant ſhe thought it would be a
pity to loſe it.</p>
            <p>Her apprehenſions indeed were, that had
ſhe remained at home, Montague, who
had perſecuted her the whole day, would
have remained alſo; and the hint his ſiſter
had given of the rivalry of the brothers
had at once ſhocked and amazed her. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a moment, however, ſhe began to fancy
that her ſpeech had more malice than mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it: but the uneaſineſs of her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the neceſſity of ſoon removing
from it, recurred to her more forcibly than
ever. She endeavoured, as ſhe went down
ſtairs, to regain her compoſure, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
that the ſtrangers, if not the family,
might remark her emotion. But ſhe ſoon
found that there was little to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0206900202:93"/>
from either the one or the other:
Captain Thorold was walking arm in arm
before the houſe with Captain Muſgrave,
the elder of the two gentlemen, and Miſs
Thorold wholly monopolized the attention
of Mr. Bettenſon, a very young man, heir
to a conſiderable fortune, who had a few
months before, on his leaving Eton, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
a Cornetcy of horſe, very much
againſt the inclinations of his father, whoſe
only ſon he was. He could indeed give
no other reaſon for his preference to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
life, but that he ſuppoſed it to be a
very idle life, and that he ſhould look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly
well in the uniform of the corps.</p>
            <p>This however did not ſucceed to his
wiſhes, though he was very far from being
aware how entirely they had failed. He
had a very round back, very narrow ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
a long forlorn face, to which the
feathered helmet gave neither grace nor
ſpirit; and the defects of his mean and ill
formed figure were rendered more apparent
by that dreſs, which is an advantage to a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0206900202:94"/>
well made and graceful man. He had twice
danced with Belle Thorold at the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
aſſemblies towards the end of winter,
and now, after having been in town for a
few weeks, prevailed on Captain Muſgrave
to introduce him to a family, where he
ſuppoſed he might find a <hi>monſtrous good
lounge</hi> for the reſt of the time he was to be
quartered in the neighbourhood. Celeſtina
no ſooner ſaw Miſs Thorold's behaviour to
this young man than ſhe accounted at once
for the diſſatisfaction ſhe had ſhewn at her
joining the party; for ſhe endeavoured by
more than her uſual vivacity to monopolize
all his attention; ſhe watched with uneaſy
curioſity every glance of his eye towards
Celeſtina; and ſeeing that he hardly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
her being among them, and was not
ſtruck with that beauty which the Captain
and Montague had ſo admired, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
reaſſumed her uſual confidence in
her own attractions, and thought only of
ſecuring the advantage ſhe had gained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0206900202:95"/>
Celeſtina, not having the remoteſt wiſh
to interfere with her conqueſts, and being
diſpleaſed and offended at the curious looks
and whiſpers of the two other military men,
who continued to ſaunter on before, was again
under the neceſſity of liſtening to Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
who never failed ſeizing every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
obliquely to hint to her the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
admiration with which ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
him, though he at the ſame time
gave her to underſtand that he knew he had
nothing to expect but her pity and her
friendſhip.</p>
            <p>This was however repeated till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
very uneaſy to her; and the more ſo,
becauſe ſo reſpectful was his addreſs that
ſhe ſeldom knew how to ſhew reſentment,
and ſo ſincere appeared his repentance,
when ſhe expreſſed any, that ſhe could
not long retain it.</p>
            <p>As they now followed the reſt of the
party, Celeſtina took occaſion to aſk
Montague for the paper ſhe had been
teized out of in the morning. "I know
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0206900202:96"/>
not," ſaid ſhe, on his evaſive anſwer,
"whether my folly in giving it, or your
abſurdity in keeping it, be the greater.
Pray reſtore it, and let us think no more
of ſuch trifling—"</p>
            <p>"I will give you," anſwered he, "a
copy of it, which I have already began to
write; but for the original—" He
ſtopped, and ſuddenly ſeizing her hand,
preſſed it to his breaſt; where, under his
waiſtcoat, the paper was enfolded. "There,"
ſaid he—"there is your paper. I have
put it next my heart, and never ſhall it be
diſplaced unleſs you will give me ſome yet
dearer memorial to remain there."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina withdrew her hand in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and feeling more than ever the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of putting an end to ſuch ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
ſhe ſaid, with evident diſpleaſure
and concern—"You behave, Mr. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,
not only improperly in this fooliſh
matter, but cruelly and inſultingly towards
me, who have, you know, at this time no
proper home to receive me; but ſince you
thus perſecute me with converſation, from
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0206900202:97"/>
which, though I cannot eſcape, I can only
hear with concern and reſentment, I muſt
as ſoon as poſſible find another temporary
abode, and acknowledging all your father's
kindneſs, quit his houſe."</p>
            <p>The young man, who, amidſt his wild
enthuſiaſm, wanted neither ſenſe nor gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
was now ſhocked at her ſuppoſing
he meant to inſult her; and terrified at the
idea of her being driven to inconvenience
by leaving his father's houſe—"I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
offending," ſaid he, in a voice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
of the concern he felt, "and I am
afraid often wrong; but pardon me once
more, Miſs De Mornay, pardon and pity
me, and I will not again treſpaſs on your
patience with diſcourſe which perhaps you
ought not to hear; though ſurely the happy
Willoughby himſelf would not be alarmed
at the hopeleſs admiration of a man—who
knows, that he can never pretend to any
other than diſtant and humble adoration:
<q>
                  <l>It were all one</l>
                  <l>That I ſhould love a bright particular ſtar.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0206900202:98"/>
He was going on, when Captain Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
who had imperceptibly ſlackened his
pace, caught theſe words, which were
ſpoken in a theatrical tone, and ſtopping
with his friend, Celeſtina and Montague
were immediately cloſe to them. "So,
Montague," ſaid he, "at the old game.
Miſs De Mornay, I barr all quotations.
'Tis not fair for Montague to avail himſelf
at once of his own talents and thoſe of all
the poets and ſonnetteers he is acquainted
with."</p>
            <p>"He will avail himſelf of neither, Sir,"
anſwered Celeſtina, "and I aſſure you I
wiſh our converſation to become more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral."</p>
            <p>"There, Montague," cried the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
"you ſee you have tired Miſs De
Mornay in your tete a tete; let us ſee if
Muſgrave and I cannot more ſucceſsfully
entertain her.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who did not promiſe herſelf
much advantage from the change, ſince
Captain Thorold's addreſs to her was often
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0206900202:99"/>
as warm as his brother's, but never ſo
reſpectful, now haſtened forward to join
Miſs Thorold; but ſhe received no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
either from her or her little military
beau: they were by this time however
near the end of their walk, and were met
by the family of Mr. Cranfield, to whom
the pond belonged which they were to
ſee fiſhed. The children, ſeveral fine
boys, now at home for their Eaſter holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
were aſſembled round it eager and
delighted. Montague, who was a great
favourite in the neighbourhood, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in talking with their mother and
with them; while their father, having
civilly noticed the whole party, entered
into converſation with the gentlemen;
and Miſs Thorold and Mr. Bettenſon ſtill
continuing to entertain each other, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of every body elſe, Celeſtina, who
was fatigued by her walk, and ſtill more
by the uneaſineſs of her reflections, ſat
down under one of the trees which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed
the pond; and her thoughts,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0206900202:100"/>
which had long been diſtracted by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
were immediately with Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby.
So intirely indeed was ſhe
for ſome moments abſorbed in reflection,
that though ſhe ſaw objects moving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her, and heard the ſhouts of the
boys, the mixed voices of the party
who ſurrounded the water, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
who were drawing the nets, ſhe
totally forgot where ſhe was, and was
inſenſible even of that want of common
politeneſs which the whole party evinced
in ſo entirely neglecting her. Montague,
however, could not long be guilty of it;
but diſengaging himſelf from Mrs. Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,
who was one of thoſe inceſſant
talkers from whom it is difficult to eſcape,
he came towards her; and fearful of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
the diſpleaſure ſhe had ſo forcibly
expreſſed a quarter of an hour before, he
only named his fears that ſhe might
receive injury by fitting on the graſs; to
which, as ſhe gave a cold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant
anſwer, he added a deep ſigh,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0206900202:101"/>
and then leaning againſt the tree under
which ſhe ſat, he fell into a reverie as
deep as her own. From this mournful
ſilence ſhe was rouſed by the ſudden
appearance of an horſeman, who rode
very faſt near her, and who, on lifting
up her eyes, ſhe immediately diſcovered to
be Vavaſour.</p>
            <p>A thouſand painful ſenſations aroſe on
the ſight of him; though the firſt idea
that occurred was, that he came from
Willoughby. He paſſed her, however,
without ſeeing her, and reaching the party
who were beyond her, he gave his horſe to
his ſervant and joined them.</p>
            <p>By the manner in which Vavaſour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
Mr. Cranfield, and the manner in
which he was received by him, Celeſtina
immediately underſtood that he was an
expected gueſt. "He comes not to me,"
ſaid ſhe. "Willoughby ſends no friend
to me! He is far, far off! and perhaps
his moſt intimate acquaintance may now
ſhun as aſſiduouſly as he once ſought me."
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0206900202:102"/>
Then the fears ſhe had. once entertained
that ſome difference of opinion had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
a quarrel between him and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
recurred to her; and remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how different her ſituation had been
when he abruptly left Alveſtone, and how
very cruel was the change, ſhe grew diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed
at the thoughts of meeting Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,
and meeting him before ſo many
ſtrangers: ſhe again repented having
walked out, and her ſoul ſickened at the
many uncomfortable occurrences to which
ſhe was continually expoſed.</p>
            <p>In a few moments, Vavaſour, who
ſeemed to have loſt none of his viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
had been introduced to the Captain
and Miſs Thorold, but he hardly made
his bow to them before he ſaid to the
latter—"Miſs De Mornay is with you ſtill,
Madam; is ſhe not?"</p>
            <p>"With us?" replied Arabella. "Oh!
yes—Miſs De Mornay is with us."</p>
            <p>"She is well I hope?" enquired Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
eagerly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0206900202:103"/>
"You may ſatisfy yourſelf by perſonal
enquiry,". ſaid Mrs. Cranfield, "for there
is the young lady. She and Mr. Montague
really form a very pictureſque appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance."</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, now turning his eyes on the
oppoſite ſide, ſaw Celeſtina, and inſtantly
advanced towards her with an eagerneſs
of manner which he took no pains to
check. She aroſe on his approach; and
hardly knowing how to receive him, ſo
various and painful were her ſenſations,
ſhe held out her hand to him, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
it; and when he ſpoke to her with
all that good humour with which he uſed
to approach her in her happier days, it
brought thoſe days back to her mind ſo
forcibly, that ſhe could not conquer her
emotion, and burſt into tears. Vavaſour
was immediately checked; and ſaid, with
evident concern—"My dear Miſs De
Mornay, the pleaſure I felt in again ſeeing
you conquered for a moment the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0206900202:104"/>
of what has happened ſince we parted
laſt."</p>
            <p>"It is a ſubject," ſaid Celeſtina, trying
to recover herſelf, "on which I cannot
now talk: yet—" and ſhe moved a few
ſteps forward to eſcape the earneſt looks of
Montague Thorold, which were fixed on
her face—"yet I cannot help aſking if
you have ſeen your friend ſince—"</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, walking on with her to avoid
the obſervation of the company, ſaid—"Seen
him? to be ſure I have: I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
with him in London all the while
he remained there."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina now proceeded in ſilence, ſtruck
with the idea that Willoughby had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
acquainted his friend during that
time with the reaſon of their abrupt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
She had not, however, courage to
aſk him; but having wiped away the tears
which a moment before filled her eyes, ſhe
turned them upon him with a look ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
of what paſſed in her heart, that
Vavaſour, who could not miſunderſtand
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0206900202:105"/>
her, anſwered, as if ſhe had ſpoken to
him—"I do not <hi>certainly</hi> know the cauſe
of George's very ſudden and extraordinary
change of meaſures; but I have reaſon to
believe the Caſtlenorths, though how I
cannot tell, were the occaſion of it. Though
I was with him every day, I had very
little converſation with him, for he always
affected to be, or really was hurried if I ſaw
him in the courſe of the day; or, if towards
night, complaining of fatigue, and taking
laudanum, without which he ſaid he could
not ſleep. When he informed me of his
having left you at Alveſtone without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
for his abſence, he ſaw my aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
and put an end at once to my
enquiries by ſaying—"Vavaſour, you know
my unbounded confidence in you, and
that any thing that related merely to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
would be known to you as the firſt
friend of my heart; but do not aſk me
any queſtions now: I cannot anſwer
them truly, and therefore I will not be
liable to them: even your friendſhip
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0206900202:106"/>
and zeal can here do me no good."
This," continued Vavaſour, "precluded
all enquiry; nor could I obtain any farther
ſatisfaction, when a few days afterwards,
the very day indeed before he left Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
he deſired I would meet him at the
chambers of Edwards, our mutual attorney,
where, in ſpite of my reſiſtance, he paid me
the money which you know I lent him, with
the intereſt, with as much regularity as if I
had fixed that time for payment; and when
I very warmly remonſtrated on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly
appearance this had, beſought
him to oblige me by keeping the money,
and expreſſed ſomething like reſentment
at his conduct, he ſaid, with a ſort of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
calmneſs, and almoſt ſternly—"Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour,
I am going abroad. I may die,
and I will not leave any thing between
us to be ſettled by Lady Molyneux,
who would be my heir at law; and do
not you," added he, "my good friend,
get a habit of throwing your four or five
thouſands about you, but learn to value
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0206900202:107"/>
money a little more—" And friends a
little leſs, ſaid I, interrupting him in my
quick way; for that, Willoughby, is the
next leſſon I expect to hear from you.
This money, however, Edwards ſhall keep
till you are quite ſure you do not want it.
"I am already ſure of it," ſaid he, "and
do beg, my dear Vavaſour, that you will
immediately pay it into the hands of the
perſon from whom you borrowed it for
my uſe, as the only way in which it can
now contribute to my ſatisfaction." Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
then left me with the attorney,
of whom I enquired if he could gueſs
where he got the money; Edwards aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
me he could not, as he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more of the affair than that he was
that day to pay it at his chambers to me."</p>
            <p>This circumſtance ſeemed, in the mind
of Celeſtina, to confirm the notion Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
had ſtarted, that the Caſtlenorths were
ſomehow or other the cauſe of Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's
having left her; yet, as they could
have no power over him from affection or
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0206900202:108"/>
friendſhip, their influence, if indeed they
poſſeſſed any, muſt ariſe from their riches;
and what was ſuch a ſuppoſition but to
ſuppoſe him a ſudden convert to merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
politics, from being generous and
diſintereſted even to exceſs, if ſuch noble
qualities could ever lean towards error.
The mind of Celeſtina no ſooner harboured
ſuch an idea than her heart rejected it;
but all ſhe heard from Vavaſour tended
only to augment her perplexity and her
ſorrow, which, as he perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
ſhe ſaw that he would if he could
have removed.</p>
            <p>Almoſt afraid of aſking any queſtion,
where it was eaſy to ſee he could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
without wounding her, ſhe acquired,
after a few moments, reſolution to ſay—"Where,
Sir, did you at laſt part from
him? What did he then ſay to you?"</p>
            <p>"I took leave of him at the hotel where
he lodged, and where I had been with him
for about an hour before the chaiſe came
to the door. He was ſometimes very
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0206900202:109"/>
grave, and even dejected for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then tried by hurry and buſtle to
drive away his dejection. I aſked him why
he went to the South of France, where he
had been before, rather than to Spain and
Sicily, which he had often expreſſed an
inclination to ſee: he anſwered, that he
had buſineſs in France; "but it is more
than probable," continued he, "that I may
ſee Spain and Sicily, or Turkey for aught
I know, before I return to England."</p>
            <p>"And did he," enquired Celeſtina
mournfully—"did he ſay nothing of me?
did he not even mention me?"</p>
            <p>"Very often," replied Vavaſour, "for
indeed I forced him into the converſation."</p>
            <p>"Did there <hi>need force</hi> then?" ſaid Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
in a plaintive tone, and ready to
melt into tears.</p>
            <p>"Yes," anſwered Vavaſour; "for
though I believe he thought of nothing
ſo much, he ſeemed frequently unwilling
to truſt his voice with your name; and
ſometimes, after we had been ſpeaking
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0206900202:110"/>
of you, he ſunk into a gloomy reverie, and
reluctantly ſpoke at all. One great object
of his ſolicitude was your future reſidence.
He ſeemed however very eaſy while you
were under Mr. Thorold's protection.
Tell me, are you yourſelf happy in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily?"</p>
            <p>"Happy!" ſaid Celeſtina; "<hi>can</hi> I be
<hi>happy</hi> any where?"</p>
            <p>"Perhaps not juſt now: but you know
what I mean when I uſe the common term
<hi>happy.</hi> Are you ſatisfied with your reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?
Do you mean to continue there?"</p>
            <p>"I hardly know," ſighed Celeſtina,
"what I mean. So heavy, ſo unexpected
was the blow that fell upon me, that my
ſtunned ſenſes have not yet recovered it;
and for happineſs—I am afraid it never
can be mine."</p>
            <p>"Well, my ſweet friend, though I
hope and believe otherwiſe, we will not
talk now either of our hopes or fears: but
are the family you are with pleaſant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
of whom do they conſiſt?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0206900202:111"/>
"Of Mr. Thorold, to whoſe worth
you have heard Willoughby do juſtice, of
his wife, his daughter, and, at preſent, of
two ſons."</p>
            <p>"Yes, I ſee the Captain is among you."</p>
            <p>"You know him then?"</p>
            <p>"A little. Some friends of mine are
acquainted with him. He is a man of
great gallantry I have heard, and affects
the very firſt world; does he not?"</p>
            <p>"Really I hardly know. Yes, I believe
he may be that ſort of man."</p>
            <p>"Celebrated, I think, for having ſent
more young women broken hearted to
Briſtol than either Charles Cavendiſh or
Ned Hervey. That is the ſort of praiſe
that attracts your hearts, while we rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
fellows, who are very honeſt though
not very refined, who ſay no more than
we mean, and addreſs you—not as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes,
only to laugh at you for believing
us, but as mere mortal women, are called
rakes and libertines and I know not what;
as if twenty ſuch careleſs, I had almoſt ſaid
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0206900202:112"/>
harmleſs, lads as we are, do half as much
miſchief as one of thoſe plauſible, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
ſighing ſycophants, who mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the gratification of their own
paltry vanity."</p>
            <p>"Bleſs me, Mr. Vavaſour," cried Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
won a moment from her own an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
by this odd remark, "you ſeem as
much diſcompoſed as if the redoubtable
Captain had ſent ſome favourite of your
own to Briſtol."</p>
            <p>"No, upon my ſoul—my favourities—I
ſpeak pretty plainly you know: <hi>my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi>
have in every inſtance <hi>but one</hi>
lain among people, not eaſily ſent to Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol.
Come now don't affect prudery. I
tell you though, Celeſtina, that had ſuch
a fellow ſent a ſiſter of mine to recover
health, ruined by the diſappointment of
expectations he had raiſed, I believe I
ſhould try if I could not ſtop his career."</p>
            <p>"It is fortunate then, perhaps, for the
Captain, that you have no ſiſter."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0206900202:113"/>
"I may, however, have friends," added
he, earneſtly fixing his eyes on the face of
Celeſtina—"I may have friends, for
whom I may be as much intereſted as
I could be for the neareſt relation; and
them I would put upon their guard."</p>
            <p>"I would very fain miſunderſtand you,"
ſaid Celeſtina, "becauſe I think you ought
to know that, ſituated as I am, I need no
ſuch precaution: or you muſt have a mean
opinion of me indeed, if, knowing Mr.
Willoughby, you can ſuppoſe that ſhe
who has once been attached to him, can
throw away a thought upon Captain Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold?"</p>
            <p>"Aye that's true—all very true and
very fine; but look ye, my dear Celeſtina,
I've no way of judging of others but
from myſelf, and (though to be ſure I
don't ſpeak from experience in theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
ſentimental ſort of treaties) I
am confoundedly afraid that had I been
engaged to Helen, and found that by
ſome curſed counter ſtroke of fortune her
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0206900202:114"/>
divinityſhip was not to be had, that after
a little raving and ſwearing and ſcamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the world to get her out of my
head, I ſhould have fallen in love with—"</p>
            <p>"With Andromache," ſaid Celeſtina,
helping him to a compariſon, and ſmiling.</p>
            <p>"Oh no!" anſwered he, "ſhe was
too wiſe and too melancholy for me:
your weeping and tragical beauties would
make me cry, but never could make me
love. Faith I think Briſeis or Chryſeis
would have been more to my taſte."</p>
            <p>"Or Creſſida perhaps?"</p>
            <p>"Oh! ſhe would have ſuited me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly."</p>
            <p>"Well Sir!" ſaid Celeſtina, re-aſſuming
her gravity, "you undoubtedly follow
the golden rule in judging of others; but
give me leave to aſſure you that in the
preſent inſtance it would miſlead you, and
that you are the only man in the world
from whom I could liſten to ſuch a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
without reſentment. You, however,
do not, I know, mean to hurt me."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0206900202:115"/>
"No that I don't by heaven," cried he,
kiſſing her hand, "and ſo do now tell me
how and when I can ſee you again."</p>
            <p>"I cannot tell; ſince it probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on your ſtay in this country."</p>
            <p>"That depends then upon you."</p>
            <p>"Upon me!"</p>
            <p>"Yes, upon you: for I came down
with no other intention in the world than
to enquire after and ſee you; and for that
purpoſe only have conſented to undergo
the company of Cranfield and his wife:
very good ſort of people indeed, but
confounded bores; who have invited me
down theſe two years, and whoſe invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
nothing but their being within four
miles of Thorold's would have made me
accept."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina was at a loſs what anſwer to
make to this, becauſe ſhe did not know
whether he meant to impute his ſolicitude
to the care he took of Willoughby's inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
or ſimply to his friendſhip for her,
for of any warmer intereſt than friendſhip
ſhe had not the remoteſt idea. She had,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0206900202:116"/>
however, no time to anſwer, for Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
Thorold, who had followed them
with his eyes ever ſince they parted from
the reſt of the company, now came haſtily
on towards them to ſay his ſiſter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina rejoined them immediately;
and after Mr. and Mrs. Cranfield and
their gueſt had been invited and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to dine with the Thorold family
the next day, they ſeparated, Vavaſour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
a violent inclination to attend
Celeſtina home, and ſeeming to repreſs it
with great difficulty from the habit he was
in of doing whatever pleaſed himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conſidering whether what he did was,
according to the eſtabliſhed forms of the
world, rude or polite. He felt, however,
that to quit his hoſpitable friends on the
moment of his arrival would be carrying
his careleſneſs a little too far; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after lingering as long as he could, he
reluctantly left her to Montague Thorold,
who had walked ſilently by her for ſome
moments, and wiſhed her a good day.</p>

            <p>CELESTINA, in whoſe mind a
thouſand painful thoughts had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
by this interview, was too much
loſt in them to attend to Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
who ſtill in ſilent dejection walked
by her, while his brother was engaged
with Arabella and his military friends.
Montague had narrowly watched her the
whole time ſhe had been converſing with
Vavaſour; and, though hopeleſs himſelf,
could not ſee her receive another with
ſuch an appearance of intereſt as he had
remarked towards Vavaſour, without mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.
"Mr Vavaſour," ſaid he at
laſt, "for that I think is the gentleman's
name—Mr. Vavaſour is an old acquaintance
of yours?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0206900202:118"/>
"A very particular friend of Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's,"
replied ſhe; "and of courſe
a friend of mine."</p>
            <p>"A ſingle man I ſuppoſe?"</p>
            <p>"I believe ſo," ſaid Celeſtina; "at
leaſt I never heard he was married; and
you ſee he has not a very ſober, married
look."</p>
            <p>"No really, very much otherwiſe. But he
does not ſeem to have communicated any
portion of his gaiety to you."</p>
            <p>"I am not indeed greatly diſpoſed to
be gay," ſaid Celeſtina; "and ſince I am
not merry, would it not be as well to be
wiſe. Do Mr. Montague, give me that
ſilly paper: its detenſion is uſeleſs to you
and diſagreeable to me."</p>
            <p>"Pardon me then if for once I am
guilty of what offends you. I cannot part
with it. But it is my firſt and ſhall be my
laſt offence."</p>
            <p>"I hope ſo," ſaid Celeſtina very
gravely. "The thing is in itſelf of no
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0206900202:119"/>
conſequence, and I wonder you ſhould be
ſo childiſhly anxious to keep it."</p>
            <p>"Your hands have touched it; your
letters are upon it; you compoſed the
lines."</p>
            <p>"Well, Sir," cried ſhe impatiently,
and willing to put an end to a ſpeech to
which ſhe feared the Captain might liſten;
"ſince you will not give it me or deſtroy
it, the only favour I have to aſk is, that
you will never ſpeak of it again, either to
me or any other perſon."</p>
            <p>"A needleſs precaution!" exclaimed
he, "a very needleſs precaution is the
latter; and, alas! in the former I cannot
treſpaſs long, for in a few days, a very
few days, I return to Oxford, and I ſhall
then be no more liable to excite your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure:
you will ceaſe to recollect that
ſuch a being exiſts."</p>
            <p>"No indeed," ſaid Celeſtina; whoever
is dear to Mr. Thorold, to your father, to
whom I am ſo much obliged, muſt have
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0206900202:120"/>
a claim to my recollection and my good
wiſhes."</p>
            <p>"Oh! how cold does that ſound from
thoſe lips," ſaid he, "and how little
thoſe expreſſive eyes are calculated to talk
of mere good wiſhes. They are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting
when they ſay more, when they
look as they did juſt now on Mr. Vavaſour.
How I envied him the ſimple "God bleſs
"you!" and—"Adieu, Mr. Vavaſour," and
the look that accompanied them."</p>
            <p>"Ridiculous!" cried Celeſtina. "Really,
Mr. Montague, the ſtyle to which you
have accuſtomed yourſelf deſtroys all
converſation. If however that adieu
was ſo enviable, I will bid you farewel
with quite as much ſincerity. God bleſs
you, and adieu, Mr. Montague. They
were now very near home, and Celeſtina,
haſtening forward, croſſed the garden by
a nearer way and reached her own room.</p>
            <p>She there began once more to meditate
on her ſituation. Every day that ſhe had
paſſed at Mr. Thorold's houſe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0206900202:121"/>
her deſire to leave it, and ſhe now
more than ever regretted that ſhe knew
not whither to go. Her concern was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by a note brought to her from the
neighbouring village, from whence ſhe
had early that morning ſent to her former
abode at Thorpe Heath to enquire whether,
if ſhe had occaſion for them, ſhe could
again have her former lodgings: the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
imported that the old man and his
wife had died within a few days of each
other, the week before, and that the houſe
now belonged to one of the ſons, who had
a large family of his own, and intended
to remove into it himſelf, as being more
convenient than his former habitation.</p>
            <p>This forlorn hope being entirely over,
her reflections on her ſituation became
more painful, ſince ſhe now knew not one
place in the world where ſhe could with
propriety go. She had once or twice
conſulted Cathcart on the ſubject; who
not being aware of the circumſtances
which rendered her preſent abode uneaſy
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0206900202:122"/>
to her, and knowing how much Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
deſired her to continue there,
rather diſcouraged than promoted any
ſcheme for her removal; flattering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that the time was not far diſtant when
her preſence would give, in the opinion of
Jeſſy and his own, a charm to the houſe
they hoped to call their own.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina was well aware of his reaſons
for wiſhing her to remain where ſhe was,
and did not love to explain her's for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to remove, leaſt ſhe ſhould appear
at once faſtidious and vain. She could
not relate to Cathcart, what after all
might be fancy, that Mrs. Thorold did
not love her though ſhe was civil to her;
that Miſs Thorold beheld her ſometimes
with diſlike and never with friendſhip;
and that of the two brothers, the elder
often affected to entertain her with conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
ſuch as, though ſhe could not
directly complain of it, ſhe could not hear
without being offended and mortified;
while the younger never ceaſed purſuing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0206900202:123"/>
her with declarations of romantic attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
leſs diſguſting, but equally if not
more improper for her to liſten to.</p>
            <p>In Mr. Thorold ſhe had always a ſteady
friend and a diſintereſted adviſer; but to
him ſhe could not ſtate the reaſons that
made his houſe uncomfortable and his
kindneſs uſeleſs, nor complain that his
wife and daughter ſlighted, or his ſons
made love to her; and though he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
a very uncommon ſhare of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ſeemed determined not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
either himſelf. On no plan of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval,
however, could ſhe at preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
and had fixed on nothing but to
find an opportunity to hint her diſcontent
to Vavaſour, when ſhe was called down to
dinner.</p>
            <p>The two military ſtrangers were gone;
but Celeſtina found they were engaged to
dine there the next day with the Cranfield
family and Mr. Vavaſour; and Mrs. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
who piqued herſelf above all other
things on giving as good entertainments
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0206900202:124"/>
as ſome of her neighbours who kept men
cooks, was ſo impatient to prepare for the
dinner of the next day, that ſhe would
hardly give herſelf time to eat that of the
preſent, but hurried away to her ſtore
room the inſtant the cloth was removed.
Arabella had yet a more important concern
to attend to; Mr. Bettenſon had been ſo
laviſh of his compliments, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the only ſort of converſation <hi>be</hi> was
at all perfect in, that ſhe had no doubt of
having made, if not an abſolute conqueſt,
at leaſt ſuch an impreſſion on his heart
as another interview would make inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;
and though his extravagant praiſes,
and the heavy language of two rolling
black eyes, (which in luſtre and ſhape
Montague compared to two pickled wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts,)
had not ſo far blinded the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Arabella but that ſhe ſaw he was
extremely weak, ſhe conſidered his great
fortune, and that if he could not lead, he
would probably ſubmit to be driven, for
which ſhe thought ſhe had all poſſible ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0206900202:125"/>
and was ſure ſhe had all poſſible
inclination. He had not a title indeed,
but was the third or fourth couſin of a man
that had; of courſe he was a man of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
himſelf; and had he not been ſo, had
his birth been mean and his perſon leſs
tolerable, his fortune would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
her a moment to conſider either as of
any conſequence. But though ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a very great inclination, and a very
well grounded hope to ſecure Bettenſon,
ſhe had not the leaſt objection to make an
experiment at the ſame time on Vavaſour,
who had a ſtill better fortune with a very
handſome figure; and who ſhe had heard
deſcribed, as one of thoſe agreeable rakes,
who are blamed and loved by all their
acquaintance. She had heard too that he
declared himſelf not to be a marrying
man; the greater therefore would be her
glory, ſhould ſhe happen to charm him
into other ſentiments; and when ſhe
looked in the glaſs ſhe thought nothing
more probable. As to Celeſtina, beſides
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0206900202:126"/>
her engagements with Willoughby, ſhe
conſidered her as quite out of the queſtion.
Neither Captain Muſgrave or Bettenſon
had taken any notice of her, and the latter
had declared he thought her far from
handſome. Arabella therefore ſaw nothing
to impede her ſucceſs; and even fancied,
that as ſhe intended to be infinitely lively
and entertaining, the melancholy air and
penſive face of Celeſtina would produce a
contraſt extremely to her advantage. While
her mother therefore was buſy with her
jelly and cuſtards, Arabella was preparing
her artillery againſt the hearts of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
gueſts; and Celeſtina, who dared
not venture out leaſt ſhe ſhould meet
Montague Thorold, who had placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
where ſhe could not eſcape him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
the whole evening alone in her
own room, where ſhe formed a ſketch of
the letter ſhe intended to write to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby.</p>
            <p>This employment, by fixing her thoughts
entirely on the object which broke in upon
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0206900202:127"/>
every other that at any time of neceſſity
engaged them, quieted and ſoothed her
ſpirits; ſhe forgot every thing but her wiſh to
convince him of her unfailing attachment,
and to pour out before him a heart that was
entirely his own. She determined, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
not to finiſh her letter till after ſhe
had talked to Vavaſour; and then recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
that ſhe could not tell Willoughby
the reſult of that conference, without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
her reaſons for deſiring to quit a
protection, where he had himſelf directed
her to remain. This was an irkſome taſk
to her; for if he ſhould happen to think
her objections frivolous, he would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
that for thoſe ſhe removed, and if
he thought them juſt, the idea of rivalry
would add to the uneaſineſs which ſhe
knew her unſettled ſituation would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to him. Thus undetermined, ſhe
could reſt on nothing but the hope that
Vavaſour might, from his diſlike to one
or other of the Thorolds, (for he was too
frequently extremely faſtidious and diſliked
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0206900202:128"/>
with all his heart) agree with her in the
neceſſity there was for her change of
abode, without enquiring into all the
reaſons that made her deſire it.</p>
            <p>By the buſtle ſhe heard below in the
houſekeeper's room, which was under part
of her's, and by the frequent running up
and down of Arabella's maid, and the
univerſal hurry of the houſehold, except
Mr. Thorold, who on theſe occaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to his ſtudy for the evening, Celeſtina
found ſhe ſhould rather accommodate than
offend if ſhe declined ſupping below. She
ſent down a note therefore, ſaying ſhe was
much fatigued with her morning's walk,
and begged to be excuſed for the evening,
and received a verbal anſwer that Mrs.
Thorold deſired ſhe would do as was moſt
agreeable to her. Montague, however,
who deſpairing of her coming out to walk,
had at laſt ſauntered away alone, no ſooner
found on his return that he was not to ſee
her at ſupper, than he went up himſelf,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0206900202:129"/>
and tapping ſoftly at the door, enquired if
ſhe was not well?</p>
            <p>"Oh! perfectly well," ſaid ſhe, "but
tired by my walk of this morning, and
not diſpoſed to eat any ſupper."</p>
            <p>"Surely," cried he, "if you are tired
you will need ſomething. You did not
drink tea, and yet will have no ſupper: let
me get ſomething for you?"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina declined this however as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely
as ſhe could; but Montague was not
to be repulſed ſo eaſily. He went down
therefore, and returning in a few minutes,
beſought her to open the door and take
ſome of the wine and water he had brought
her. Diſtreſſed by civility, which it ſeemed
ſo rude to refuſe and ſo painful to accept,
ſhe heſitated a moment, and then opened
the door, when taking one of the glaſſes
ſhe thanked him and would have wiſhed
him good night; but he looked earneſtly
in her face—"Ah!" ſaid he, "tears!
you have been weeping again! always in
tears! You have been writing too—writing
to the fortunate Willoughby?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0206900202:130"/>
"Pray dont teaze me ſo," cried Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina:
"if I have cauſe for tears, you
ſhould remember that the greateſt kindneſs
you can do me is permitting me to indulge
them; and it ſignifies not who I write
to."</p>
            <p>"It ſignifies no more indeed," ſaid
Montague, with a deep drawn ſigh, "than
as it excites my envy and my regret."</p>
            <p>"Well, well, good night to you," in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
Celeſtina. "Pray dont let me
keep you from ſupper."</p>
            <p>"Oh!" ſaid he, putting his foot within
the door ſo as to prevent her ſhutting it,
"I have had my ſupper. One look ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
me:
<q>
                  <l>Looſe now and then</l>

               </q>
But you are angry?"</p>
            <p>"I am at leaſt tired," ſaid Celeſtina,
"and muſt beg you would no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
me."</p>
            <p>Give me your hand then in token
that we part in peace.</p>

            </q>
            <p>"There, Sir," ſaid Celeſtina coldly,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0206900202:132"/>
"there is my hand, and now good
night."</p>
            <p>"Oh that I dared ſeal my forgiveneſs
upon it," cried he, eagerly preſſing it.
"But I dare not."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina withdrew her hand, and again
repeating a cold good night, he at length
permitted her to ſhut the door.</p>
            <p>Theſe frequent declarations, which ſhe
could not affect to miſunderſtand, greatly
diſturbed her; and ſo well aware was ſhe
of the impropriety of ſuffering them, that
ſhe was determined no conſideration ſhould
induce her to remain another week, if Mr.
Montague was not really returning within
that time to Oxford. She had heard him
repeatedly laughed at by his father, his
brother, and his ſiſter, for his parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſms
of love: if his preſent attention to
her was only a return of the fit, ſhe felt
herſelf degraded by being made the object
of it; and if it was more ſerious, ſhe thought
herſelf to blame to ſuffer his aſſiduities, on
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0206900202:133"/>
account of his father, though ſhe knew
not very well how to put an end to them.
Much leſs appearance of paſſion would
have made many young women believe
him ready to take the lover's leap, or to
apply laudanum or gunpowder as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
but Celeſtina, though not uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of her perſonal advantages, had none
of that overweening vanity which make ſo
many of inferior attractions fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
irreſiſtible, nor any of that unfeeling
coquetry, which would be gratified by
the deſpair of a man capable of real attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
ſhe wiſhed to put an end to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague's
perſecuting admiration both for his
ſake and her own; and after ſome reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
concluded, that it would be better
to take an opportunity of ſpeaking to him
the next day, and declaring to him that
his extravagant behaviour would compel
her to quit the houſe and loſe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
of his family; for ſhe thought,
notwithſtanding all his romantic flights, he
had ſo much good ſenſe, that he would ſee
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0206900202:134"/>
the impropriety, and indeed the cruelty of
his conduct, if it were once fairly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to him. She now almoſt repented
that ſhe had not liſtened with more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to the boaſting egotiſm of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and had taken ſhelter from his equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal
compliments in the more agreeable
becauſe more literary converſation of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague;
and again ſhe reflected, with bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of heart, that whether Montague went
or ſtayed, his brother's character, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his manners towards her, made her
remaining where ſhe was extremely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper;
yet that no eligible ſituation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:
and for the firſt time, ſince ſhe had
left Lady Molyneux, ſhe formed a half
wiſh to be again with her, though ſhe
knew ſhe had there little kindneſs and no
real friendſhip to expect.</p>

            <p>THE preparations for a ſplendid din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſucceeded admirably, and Mrs. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold
was in high good humour when her
gueſts arrived. Arabella was ſtill better
pleaſed; for Bettenſon, immediately on
his entrance, had proteſted that ſhe never
looked ſo well in her life, and Muſgrave
whiſpered to her, that "if ſhe minded her
hits ſhe would be ſure of the pretty boy,"
for ſo he, the Cornet, was termed by his
Captain. Intelligence ſo conveyed would
have diſguſted and offended a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of delicacy, but Belle Thorold was
too eager for conqueſt, and too reſolutely
bent on ſecuring a man of fortune, to
feel or to reſent the freedom of this addreſs
from Muſgrave, to whoſe praiſes of her
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0206900202:136"/>
ſhe knew much of the attention of Betten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was owing. Mr. and Mrs. Cranfield
and Vavaſour ſoon after arrived; and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
ſaw with ſurpriſe the pains Miſs
Thorold took at once to attract the notice
of Vavaſour, and encreaſe the admiration
of Bettenſon. She had never before ſeen
her in the company of young unmarried
men of fortune, and now obſerved with
concern how totally ſhe defeated her own
purpoſe. She threw herſelf into number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
attitudes which ſhe fancied becoming;
applied her hand inceſſantly to rectify a
curl, or adjuſt her necklace, by which ſhe
thought to diſplay it's beauty as well as
that of her hair, and her throat, which ſhe
had been taught to fancy eminently hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.
 She whiſpered about nothing,
laughed at ſome joke which nobody un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
but herſelf and Muſgrave, then
affected to be angry at ſomething he ſaid
to her, then talked to him by ſigns acroſs
the table, and by way of being charming
was rude and childiſh. But this ſort of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0206900202:137"/>
behaviour ſhe had ſeen practiſed by ſome
very faſhionable young women; it was
perfectly adapted to the level of Bettenſon's
capacity; and ſhe had not judgment enough
to ſee that it muſt offend any man who
had either good ſenſe or good breeding.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, who in the preſence of Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
would have ſeen perfect beauty or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
merit with indifference, took
no other notice of Arabella than juſt ſerved
him to remark to Celeſtina that ſhe was
one of the moſt conceited and pert girls he
had ever ſeen. This ſerved, as they
walked after tea in the garden, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the diſcourſe ſhe wiſhed to hold with
him: but it was extremely difficult to
eſcape a moment from the vigilant aſſiduity
of Montague Thorold. "Pray," ſaid ſhe
to Vavaſour, "pray be more guarded: her
brother will hear you."</p>
            <p>"And that brother," ſaid he, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
abruptly, "you ſeem very much
afraid of offending, though he ſeems to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0206900202:138"/>
me to be a puppy; how can you let him
prate to you as he does?"</p>
            <p>"Indeed," replied Celeſtina, "you
would not diſlike him if you knew him;
and it is amazing to me that you, who are
really ſo good humoured, ſhould take ſuch
diſlikes to people before you can poſſibly
know them."</p>
            <p>"And when I do know them I often
diſlike them more. Why now, in this
family, who is there but the father that has
any underſtanding, and he has too much
of the prieſt about him. But here comes
your highflying Oxonian. Surely it's hard
not to have a moment with you, though
I want to talk to you about Willoughby."</p>
            <p>"I will ſpeak to Mr. Montague," ſaid
ſhe, "and tell him ſo." She then ſtepped
back a few paces, and meeting Montague
Thorold, who was approaching to join
them, ſhe told him that Mr. Vavaſour had
ſomething to communicate to her on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of their mutual friend Willoughby,
and that ſhe ſhould eſteem herſelf obliged
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0206900202:139"/>
to him if he would prevent their being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
for a few moments.</p>
            <p>Montague, with a melancholy and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
look, laid his hand on his heart
and ſaid—"One word from you is enough
to him who lives but to obey you." He
then went back to the reſt of the party,
caſting a wiſtful look after Celeſtina, who,
turning into another walk with Vavaſour,
ſaid eagerly—"Well, and now what have
you to ſay to me from Willoughby? have
you heard from him?"</p>
            <p>"No," replied Vavaſour; "I could
not well do that ſince yeſterday, nor do I
indeed expect it for ſome time to come:
but do you know, Miſs De Mornay, that I
conſider myſelf as Willoughby's repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
as a ſort of guardian to you, and am
going in that character to talk to you very
ſeriouſly."</p>
            <p>"Well," cried Celeſtina, conſcious
that her own conduct was irreproachable,
"my ſage guardian and reverend monitor,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0206900202:140"/>
begin then with your remonſtrance or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
whichever it is to be."</p>
            <p>"You muſt give me leave to be ſerious
on this occaſion," anſwered he.</p>
            <p>"Moſt willingly," replied Celeſtina,
interrupting him; "and the more ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I never remember in all our former
converſations to have had one ſerious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with you, and I long to ſee how you
acquit yourſelf."</p>
            <p>"I don't like the people you are with,"
ſaid he, "and wiſh you were any where
elſe."</p>
            <p>"I wiſh I were any where elſe myſelf;
yet I like the family, and believe them to
be very good ſort of people."</p>
            <p>"Come, come, Celeſtina, you cannot
be ignorant of what I mean: Captain Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
as I told you yeſterday, is that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and hateful character, a male co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet."</p>
            <p>"He never coquets with me I aſſure
you," ſaid ſhe, "for I never give him an
opportunity."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0206900202:141"/>
"No, becauſe at preſent his brother has
the advantage of him. If you do not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
with the military man, at leaſt you
liſten to the ſcholar, and it may be he is
the moſt dangerous of the two. It is the
general idea of the country that he is in
love with you; that—</p>
            <p>"The general idea of the country!"
cried Celeſtina; "how can the country
poſſibly know any thing about him or about
me?"</p>
            <p>"My dear friend," interrupted Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,
"you cannot be ignorant that in
theſe places the people could not exiſt if
their curioſity did not keep their idleneſs
from total ſtagnation. They will talk, and
let them about one another, but I won't
have them talk of you, who are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
order of beings: in ſhort, I am jealous
of you <hi>for my friend,</hi> and don't like to
hear that Lord Caſtlenorth has paid off all
Willoughby's incumbrances, and that he
has procured him the reverſion of his titles,
to engage him to break off his connection
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0206900202:142"/>
with you, which it is ſaid he formed before
he came of age, and therefore thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
obliged to fulfil."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina cried with great emotion—"Dear
Sir! but how falſe and fooliſh is
all this."</p>
            <p>"It is ſo," reſumed Vavaſour; "and
what follows is equally or more ſo, yet it is
I find generally believed."</p>
            <p>"And what is it?"</p>
            <p>"Why that Willoughby, having ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
about ſuddenly leaving you, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you in comparative indigence, Lord
Caſtlenorth has given you five thouſand
pounds; which, with what was before left
you by Mrs. Willoughby, and the promiſe
of a very conſiderable living in the gift of
the Caſtlenorths to a clergyman if you
marry one, have rendered you a deſirable
object in Mr. Thorold's eyes as a wife for
his youngeſt ſon, whom finally you have
accepted of, and are to be married to very
ſoon; as Miſs Fitz-Hayman has inſiſted
upon this before ſhe gives her hand to her
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0206900202:143"/>
couſin, which is alſo to happen very ſoon
in Italy."</p>
            <p>"Miſs Fitz-Hayman!" ſaid Celeſtina;
turning pale; "and pray, my good Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour,
where have you learned this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend?"</p>
            <p>"In London," replied he, "I collected
enough to make-me uneaſy about your ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.
I picked up more ſince I came
down to Cranfields, for his wife is a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſip
of the firſt pretenſions; and as to the
Fitz-Hayman part of the ſtory, their going
abroad ſo ſoon after Willoughby has, I take
it for granted, confirmed it in the opinion
of every body."</p>
            <p>"Are they gone abroad then?" ſaid
Celeſtina.</p>
            <p>"So ſay the newſpapers; and I fancy
rightly." He then took one from his
pocket and read this paragraph:</p>

            <p>Celeſtina was ſilent a moment; for not
all her faith on the unchangeable affections
of her lover could guard her from a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
ſhock: recovering herſelf how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſhe ſaid—"They may be, and I
ſuppoſe <hi>are</hi> gone; but—certainly—cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Mr. Willoughby had no ſhare in
their going. You ſurely do not think he
had? As we know ſome part—great part
of what you have heard, to be utterly
falſe and unfounded, why may it not all be
ſo? Certainly you do not believe any of it."</p>
            <p>"Pardon me," anſwered Vavaſour, "I
believe that this young man, this Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
Thorold, is what they call in love with
you; for the reſt, I know ſome of it is falſe,
and I believe the greateſt part of it is ſo."</p>
            <p>"Gracious heaven! you have doubts
then, Vavaſour: doubts whether Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby—But
it is impoſſible you <hi>can</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0206900202:145"/>
doubt it. You know he is all honour, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,
integrity, and goodneſs."</p>
            <p>"I know I always thought ſo, or I
ſhould not have loved him better than any
man breathing. But don't let me alarm
you; I cannot doubt when I recollect all I
ever knew of my friend: yet I very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
tell you, that the myſtery he made
to me of his reaſons for going abroad, the
gloomy reveries in which I ſo often ſaw
him, his evident ſtruggles with himſelf,
and a thouſand odd circumſtances which
ſtruck me when we were laſt together—upon
my ſoul, Celeſtina, I know not what
to think, and ſhould deceive you were I
to tell you that I have no doubts: yet they
ariſe rather from my miſtruſt of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in general than my opinion of George
as an individual: but when I look at you,
and remember that he was within one day
of calling you his, I cannot upon any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
principles account for his conduct,
and am ſure that no common motives can
juſtify it."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0206900202:146"/>
Celeſtina, whoſe heart ſunk within her
while it could not deny the juſtice of this
remark, ſighed deeply, but remained ſilent;
and Vavaſour went on—"Be <hi>his</hi> motives,
however, what they may, it is certainly
your determination to await the event of
this myſterious journey?"</p>
            <p>"It is certainly," ſaid ſhe faintly.</p>
            <p>"Well then, is there not any more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
ſituation for you than one where you
are the ſubject of ſuch reports as I have juſt
repeated to you? Suppoſe, if it be only
for ſuppoſition ſake, they were to reach
Willoughby: if he ſtill loves you—"</p>
            <p>"If!" repeated Celeſtina; "good hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!
you believe then that it admits of a
queſtion."</p>
            <p>"I did not mean to hurt you. But my
dear Celeſtina, there is nothing ſo inſecure
as our affections I am afraid; and you
muſt recollect too many inſtances of their
change to ſuppoſe it <hi>quite</hi> impoſſible that—"</p>
            <p>"Well, I will interrupt you no more.
If then—if Willoughby ſtill loves me—"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0206900202:147"/>
"He will ſuffer extremely from ſuch a
report; and ſhould—though I allow it to
be very improbable—<hi>ſhould</hi> any change
have happened, your apparent approbation
of Montague Thorold will juſtify that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price
which nothing elſe <hi>can</hi> juſtify."</p>
            <p>"Ah! Vavaſour," ſaid Celeſtina, in
faultering accents, "I ſee, I too evidently
ſee, that you believe your friend is loſt to
me for ever, and that all you have now
ſaid is merely to prepare me for a blow,
which, if it fell on me ſuddenly, would,
you think, deſtroy me; but believe me,
Vavaſour, believe me, ſuſpenſe ſuch as I
have long endured—ſuch as I at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
endure—is, I <hi>think,</hi> more inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than any certainty could be, unleſs it
were the certainty that Willoughby is more
miſerable than I am: that I think I could
not bear: but for the reſt, however I might
ſuffer in my pride or in my love, I truſt
that my mind would in time be reconciled
to whatever is inevitable; and perhaps,"
continued ſhe, ſtruggling with the violent
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0206900202:148"/>
emotion ſhe felt—"perhaps that very
pride might aſſiſt me to cure the anguiſh
of diſappointed and improperly indulged
affection. But yet it is ſurely impoſſible
Willoughby <hi>can</hi> have acted as theſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions
in regard to Miſs Fitz Hayman
would make me imagine, and ſtill write as
he writes to me! However, Vavaſour, I
again entreat you, if you know more than
I do, to conceal nothing from me through
miſplaced and needleſs tenderneſs."</p>
            <p>"You know me very little," anſwered
Vavaſour, "or you would know how little
concealment and diſſimulation are in my
nature. My dear Miſs De Mornay, I have
faithfully related to you all I know of our
friend, and even my half formed doubts I
have not attempted to conceal from you:
be now equally ingenuous with me, and
tell me, whether you think your preſent
ſituation is either the moſt pleaſant or the
moſt eligible you could poſſibly chuſe."</p>
            <p>"It is not pleaſant," anſwered Celeſtina,
"becauſe I am not miſtreſs of my time;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0206900202:149"/>
but it is eligible ſurely, becauſe Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
himſelf in ſome meaſure placed me in it,
and it is to his wiſhes I am to attend while
he is yet intereſted about me, and not to
the vague and unfounded reports of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who care nothing whether I am happy
or miſerable, ſo long as they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to talk of."</p>
            <p>"But reflect a moment whether Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
when he mentioned his deſire of
your continuing here, was aware that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Thorold would <hi>therefore</hi> remain at
home all the ſummer, or that Montague
Thorold would chuſe to make you the
object of his romantic paſſion, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his poetical panegyric: you cannot
but know that he does both; and were <hi>you</hi>
wilfully blind to it, his behaviour to-day
would have ſufficiently convinced <hi>me.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina could not deny his extreme
particularity in company, and his private
declarations were leſs equivocal: without
however acknowledging either to Vavaſour,
ſhe ſaid in general, that for many reaſons
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0206900202:150"/>
ſhe ſhould not be diſpleaſed to change her
reſidence if ſhe knew whither to go.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour then began to lament that he
had no mother, no ſiſter, of whoſe friendly
reception of her he could be aſſured; "but,"
added he, "my dear Miſs De Mornay,
give me a day or two, and ſome proper
place will perhaps occur to me, or rather
to an excellent female friend whom I will
apply to. In the mean time I will ſee
Cathcart, as I propoſe to ride over to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtone
to-morrow, and we will talk the
buſineſs over together." He then took
her hand, and in a manner more tender
and leſs lively than was uſual with him,
aſked her if ſhe would pardon him for any
thing he might have ſaid to give her pain.
Celeſtina aſſured him ſhe could not forgive
becauſe ſhe had never been offended, but
that ſhe muſt ever be greatly obliged to
him for the friendly part he had taken; and
then, fearing that ſome invidious remarks
might be made by the company they had left
if they were any longer abſent, ſhe deſired
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0206900202:151"/>
Vavaſour to rejoin them, while ſhe went
for a few moments to her own room to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
from the ſtill apparent emotion which
ſhe had been thrown into from what had
paſſed.</p>
            <p>She had hardly, however, time to breathe,
before ſhe ſaw Montague Thorold walking
anxiouſly on the lawn before her windows,
looking towards them as if he knew ſhe
was returned to her apartment, and almoſt
immediately afterwards Mr. Cranfield's
carriage drove up to the door to take them
home. Celeſtina now, therefore, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
herſelf as well as ſhe was able,
haſtened down to the company, who, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Montague and Vavaſour, were hardly
conſcious of her rejoining them: Mr.
Cranfield being buſied in giving to the
elder Mr. Thorold a long detail of a cauſe
that had been lately decided at the ſeſſions
in which he had a principal ſhare; Mrs.
Thorold and Mrs. Cranfield engaged in
ſettling the affairs of the neighbourhood,
and comparing notes on the frequency of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0206900202:152"/>
Mr. Langly, the curate's viſits to Mrs.
Poole, the widow of a rich farmer, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in which theſe good ladies were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
intereſted; while Miſs Thorold was
violently flirting with Bettenſon; and the
other two military men walking together,
were talking over their former adventures,
and Muſgrave laughing at Captain Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold
for being thrown out, as he termed it,
by his brother with Celeſtina. "What
the devil," ſaid he, "d'ye bury yourſelf
alive in this manner for; if Montague is to
ſupplant you? Faith, my dear Edmund, 'tis
ſo much againſt the honour of us all, that
if you don't make more progreſs I ſhall try
what I can do myſelf. Don't you ſee that
her attachment to Willoughby is all ſtuff,
and that ſhe throws out her lure for this
Vavaſour? If you like her, what a curſed
fool you muſt be to let her ſlip through
your fingers."</p>
            <p>"As to liking," replied Captain Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
"you don't ſuppoſe I intend to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0206900202:153"/>
commit matrimony. The girl is handſome,
and has more ſenſe than moſt of them—"</p>
            <p>"And therefore 'tis more worth a man's
while to make a fool of her. There I
perfectly agree with you; for though, if I
were condemned by any deviliſh miſchance
to marry, I ſhould dread nothing ſo much
as one of your ſenſible women, yet it is
glorious to ſee how a little fooliſh flattery
can ſet the ſenſe of the ſhrewdeſt of them
at nought. But by the way, Edmund,
how did you get off with that buſineſs in
Ireland?"</p>
            <p>"Which? for I had ſo much buſineſs
upon my hands that I don't know what you
mean."</p>
            <p>"Why between you and Miſs Obrien:
was there not an impertinent brother or—"</p>
            <p>"Oh! aye poor Fanny Obrien. 'Twas
the old ſtory: Fanny was very pretty, and
faith I was very fond of being with them
all, for there were three others, all ſweet
little dears. Their mother, a good ſort of
a widow, was a little upon the <hi>qui vive</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0206900202:154"/>
when ſhe heard I had a fortune and ſo
forth, and ſomehow or other I lived a good
deal at the houſe, and talked nonſenſe to
the girls in my way you know, till this
Miſs Fanny took it into her head to fancy
herſelf in love with me, and to ſuppoſe I
had told her that I was ſo with her, though
if I did upon my ſoul 'twas only by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
I dangled to be ſure, and dined
and danced with her; but I meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and was obliged at laſt to tell her
mother ſo, who very plainly ſignified to
me, one evening after I had paſſed the
day with them, that it was time to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
me. Well, I gave her to underſtand
then, as civilly as I could though, for
faith they were a good ſort of a family, that
I had no thoughts of marrying, and the
good gentlewoman waxed wrath about it,
and told me I had done a very unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
thing in winning her daughter's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
I could only lament they were
ſo eaſily won, and return them undamaged
by me. Something I ſaid, however, gave
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0206900202:155"/>
Mrs. Obrien offence, and ſhe deſired to ſee
me no more; a prohibition which I of
courſe did not attempt to diſobey; and
ſome other pretty girl falling in my way,
faith I thought no more of my poor Fanny,
till being one night at an aſſembly at Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
I ſaw a great buſtle ſoon after my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
and was told that Miſs Obrien had
fainted away upon ſeeing me, and was
gone home extremely ill. 'Twas no fault
of mine you know that the girl was ſo
ſimply ſuſceptible: but her brother, a
fierce young ſailor, who came a day or
two afterwards from his ſhip, thought
otherwiſe, and talking to me rather cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lierly,
we agreed that the matter muſt be
ſettled in the Phoenix Park by a brace of
piſtols. <hi>Un beau jour</hi> we accordingly met
there, and exchanged each a couple of
ſhot with all poſſible politeneſs, in which
it was my fortune to lodge a bullet in the
ſleſh of his left arm, which was immediately
extracted. I heard there was no danger;
and as he was of courſe ſatisfied, I came
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0206900202:156"/>
off to England the next day, having taken
my paſſage ſome time before."</p>
            <p>"Your folks here at home never heard
of the hazard you ran?"</p>
            <p>"No, I believe not. My father is a
little too apt to lecture and preach on ſuch
occaſions, and ſo 'tis as well ſunk I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
and ſince I've been in England faith
I've had no inclination to amuſe myſelf in
the ſame way, nor indeed any opportunity,
except with this Celeſtial beauty, and ſhe
don't ſeem to take to me."</p>
            <p>"The greater will be the glory," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Muſgrave. "I own I ſhould like
of all things, were I thee, to drive out a
ſolemn, ſettled, ſentimental affection from
ſuch a heart as her's, and jockey thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Montague."</p>
            <p>Here the gentlemen were interrupted
by the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field
and Vavaſour; after which Muſgrave
and Bettenſon took leave themſelves, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt received a general invitation from
Mrs. Thorold and her daughter; who,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0206900202:157"/>
though by no means pleaſed to obſerve
that Vavaſour, entirely occupied by Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
had beheld and heard her with frigid
indifference, was yet much conſoled by
being almoſt certain that ſhe had ſecured
the heart of the little Cornet. She judged
very right. Muſgrave, to whoſe care the
father of Bettenſon had recommended him,
had purpoſely introduced him to Arabella
Thorold, under the idea of detaching him
from two milleners, to both of whom he
had been making very ſerious love ever
ſince his reſidence at Exeter; and the elder
Mr. Bettenſon was ſo deſirous of ſaving
him from a connection of that kind, which
he was thus likely to form, that he no
ſooner heard of his growing partiality to
Miſs Thorold, than he beſought Captain
Muſgrave by every poſſible means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
it, declaring that fortune alone was
no object to him, and that he ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himſelf happy if his ſon was fixed in
his choice of the daughter of ſo worthy and
reſpectable a man as Mr. Thorold.</p>

            <p>THE ſhort remainder of the evening
paſt very unpleaſantly to Celeſtina while
ſhe continued in company, for Montague,
to whom ſhe could not prevail upon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be rude, was yet ſo diſſatisfied, either
from the conſtraint he obſerved ſhe wore
towards him, or from her long conference
with Vavaſour, that he could not conceal
his concern, and ſighed ſo loud and ſo
long, as to attract notice and ſome very
acrimonious ſpeeches from his mother.
Mr. Thorold too, ſhe thought, looked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy,
and Arabella evidently diſliked her
more than before; while the Captain's rude
examination of her countenance, from
which ſhe always ſhrunk, was now more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to her than ever. She got away as ſoon
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0206900202:159"/>
as poſſible; but was far, very far from
finding repoſe in ſolitude. All that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour
had ſaid now returned to torture
her; and inſtead of finding ſleep when ſhe
retired to her pillow, the ſame uneaſy
thoughts and harraſſing conjectures which
had long rendered it of difficult acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had now received ſuch a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as made it impoſſible for her to ſleep
at all.</p>
            <p>She roſe with the dawn of day, hoping
ſhe might in the courſe of it ſee Cathcart;
and yet from him ſhe had little to expect
as to her removal, unleſs he could find for
her ſome farm houſe in the neighbourhood
of Jeſſy, where ſhe might have board and
lodging. But even to this ſcheme there
were objections: it would be too near the
Thorold's: the young men might ſtill viſit
her, and the reports ſtill obtain which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour
had repeated to her; becauſe, though
Montague was really, ſhe found, returning
to Oxford in a few days, there would be
other occaſions of his being at home. It
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0206900202:160"/>
was alſo too near Alveſtone, which, ſince
ſhe almoſt deſpaired now of ſeeing again
with pleaſure, ſhe wiſhed to eſcape ſeeing
even at the diſtance from which ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
beheld it; when the clump of
firs and ſome of the high grounds in the
park, conſpicuous from almoſt every part
of the country within ten or fifteen miles,
often drew from her heart many a bitter
ſigh.</p>
            <p>About eight o'clock, ſhe ſaw Cathcart
enter the little lawn before the houſe and
immediately went down to him. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
her with more than ordinary
cheerfulneſs; but in anſwering her queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
told her he had not heard from Mr.
Willoughby.</p>
            <p>"I flattered myſelf you had," ſaid Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
ſinking again into dejection, "for
I thought, Cathcart, you ſeemed unuſually
cheerful."</p>
            <p>"If any thing could make me long ſo,"
replied he, "when you, my dear Madam,
and my noble friend are divided and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0206900202:161"/>
it would be the intelligence I have
received about my ſiſter, whoſe ſituation,
you know, and my ſolicitude for her and
her children; was indeed the only one Mr.
Willoughby's goodneſs would have left
me, if he had himſelf been as happy as he
deſerved to be."</p>
            <p>"And what then have you heard," en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Celeſtina, "of Mrs. Elphinſtone?"</p>
            <p>"That her huſband, who has been
long wandering about the world, is at
length ſettled, in a very remote ſituation
indeed, but one which he happens to like
and which is likely to become profitable.
He is appointed to ſuperintend the fiſheries
eſtabliſhed by a ſociety of gentlemen in
the weſtern iſlands of Scotland, and is
already put in poſſeſſion of a good houſe
in the iſle of Skie. Thither my ſiſter is
about to follow him; but I have prevailed
upon her to ſend to me her two youngeſt
children, whom I ſhall put to nurſe in
ſome farm houſe where Jeſſy or I can
viſit them every day: the other two are
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0206900202:162"/>
as many as it will be poſſible for her to
take care of, and when ſhe is ſettled, I
have engaged to conduct the little ones to
her. She has already received money
from Elphinſtone to enable her to ſet out
well equipped, and waits only to ſee me
before ſhe takes leave of London, and,
ſhe ſays, ſhe hopes for ever."</p>
            <p>"And when do you go?"</p>
            <p>"I propoſe ſetting out for London on
Thurſday, unleſs you or Mr. Willoughby
have any commands for me that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
me longer."</p>
            <p>"Alas! Cathcart," ſaid Celeſtina, "I
am afraid you will receive no intelligence
of Willoughby by that time: but I can
find, I believe, ſomething for you to do
for me which will rather expedite than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
you."</p>
            <p>Cathcart then aſſuring her how happy
every opportunity of ſhewing his gratitude
would make him, Celeſtina ſaid—"Well
then, my commands are ſimply theſe, that
inſtead of going on horſeback you come
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0206900202:163"/>
hither in a poſt-chaiſe on Thurſday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and take me with you to ſee my dear
Jeſſy, as I cannot go without having that
ſatisfaction, and afterwards, Cathcart, you
ſhall take me to London with you,"</p>
            <p>Cathcart expreſſing ſome ſurpriſe at her
reſolution, ſhe told him that ſhe would
account for it as they went; that Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire
was at preſent very unpleaſant to her,
and that ſhe fancied change of place would
relieve her ſpirits more than all her reaſon
and her philoſophy, "which, to tell you the
truth, Cathcart," ſaid ſhe, "may be accuſed
of acting a little like Horatio; and I
ſometimes am tempted to ſay to them—
<q>
                  <l>Is then the boaſted purpoſe of your friendſhip</l>
                  <l>To tell Caliſta what a wretch ſhe is?</l>
                  <l>Alas! what needed that?</l>
               </q>
But however, I find really, Cathcart, that
I cannot here obey our dear friend in the
points he moſt inſiſts upon, thoſe of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my cheerfulneſs and preſerving my
health, and I have a mind to try his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0206900202:164"/>
remedy and ramble a little. Perhaps I
may go to Scotland with your ſiſter. Do
you think ſhe would admit me as a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
companion?"</p>
            <p>"Admit you, dear Madam," ſaid
Cathcart. "Surely ſhe would be but too
much honoured. But you can never be
ſerious?"</p>
            <p>"It is, however, very likely that I may
become ſo. At preſent, my reſolution is
to take leave of this family and go with
you to London. You will ſee Vavaſour
to day, and you may tell him ſo."</p>
            <p>They then ſettled the hour at which the
poſt-chaiſe was to be ready for her the
next morning ſave one. Cathcart returned
to Alveſtone; and Celeſtina to the houſe,
where ſhe propoſed taking the earlieſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of acquainting Mr. Thorold with
her determination.</p>
            <p>She conſidered herſelf rather as Mr.
Thorold's viſitor than as the gueſt of any
other of the family; and wiſhed to have
his approbation for the ſtep ſhe was about
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0206900202:165"/>
to take, without however aſſigning the
reaſons that actuated her to take it. She
had frequently fancied of late that he ſaw
more than he choſe to notice, and that,
though he was too generous to repent the
friendly invitation he had given her, he
was too prudent not to foreſee ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from her long continuing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it. In the midſt of a large family.
to which he was greatly attached, Mr.
Thorold lived much of his time alone.
His ſtudy and his pariſhioners divided the
day, and, except at dinner and for about
an hour afterwards, his wife and children
ſaw very little of him. Celeſtina was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
till ſhe had ſpoken to him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he roſe to go for his walk after
dinner, ſhe enquired whether he would
allow her to go part of the way with him,
as ſhe wiſhed to ſpeak a few words to him
alone.</p>
            <p>Montague bluſhed deeply as ſhe thus
addreſſed herſelf to his father; who led her
however out of the room, and taking her
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0206900202:166"/>
arm within his in his uſual friendly way,
took the way towards the village ſtreet,
where he had, he ſaid, ſome patients to
viſit that evening; for he was the phyſician
as well as the paſtor of his people. After
a few minutes of embarraſſing ſilence on
the part of Celeſtina, ſhe collected courage
enough to tell him, that in conſequence
of ſome intelligence ſhe had learned from
Mr. Vavaſour, ſhe had determined to go
to London.</p>
            <p>"Not under <hi>his</hi> convoy I hope?" cried
Mr. Thorold, eagerly interrupting her.</p>
            <p>"No," anſwered Celeſtina, a little
ſtartled by the manner in which he ſpoke:
"not by any means with him, or under
his care; but with Mr. Cathcart, who is
going on buſineſs of his own."</p>
            <p>"You know, my dear Miſs De Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,"
ſaid Mr. Thorold very gravely,
"that my houſe and my beſt advice are
equally and always at your ſervice: you
may have reaſons for quitting the one and
rejecting the other, into which were I to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0206900202:167"/>
enquire it would produce for me nothing
but mortification. I will <hi>not</hi> then enquire;
I will only entreat you to conſider well,
whither and with whom you go. Mr. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour
has, I apprehend, no mother or
ſiſter, and you cannot be ignorant that he
has the character of indulging himſelf in
liberties, which even in this age of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
make him rather a marked man."</p>
            <p>"My dear Sir," replied Celeſtina, "I
have not the moſt diſtant idea of quitting
your protection for one ſo little proper as
Mr. Vavaſour's muſt be, though he is the
moſt intimate friend of Mr. Willoughby.
But my meaning merely is—"</p>
            <p>"Come," cried Mr. Thorold, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
her, "I will explain your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or rather the meaning of Vavaſour.
He has been talking to you about my ſon
Montague. He has repreſented the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety
of your liſtening to ſuch ſort of
converſation as I know Montague has
more than once entertained you with. Is
it not ſo?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0206900202:168"/>
"I own it is," ſaid Celeſtina in ſome
confuſion.</p>
            <p>"I do not blame him," rejoined Mr.
Thorold; "and if his vigilance is the
effect of <hi>friendſhip,</hi> I commend him. Nor
do I, my dear ward, diſapprove of your
wiſhing to ſhun the boyiſh importunity of
Montague. I only entreat you to reflect
well on your removal, and to remember,
that notwithſtanding Mr. Vavaſour's inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
connection with Willoughby, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
myſelf as having ſome claim to your
confidence and as in ſome degree anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for your diſpoſal of yourſelf."</p>
            <p>"You are very good, dear Sir, and
deſerve I am ſure my gratitude as well as
my confidence. You deſerve too that I
ſhould ſpeak to you with the utmoſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity."
She then related to him, all that
Vavaſour had ſaid to her of the reports
that had obtained relative to her and Mr.
Montague; and concluded by ſaying,
that though ſhe highly eſteemed his ſon,
and had the moſt grateful regard for the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0206900202:169"/>
whole family, ſhe could not liſten to theſe
reports without concern, becauſe they
might be diſpleaſing to him and injurious
to views he might have for his ſon, even
putting herſelf out of the queſtion. "I
think therefore, dear Sir," added ſhe,
"that it will be better for me to put an
end to my viſit for this time, and to travel
into the North with a ſiſter of Mr. Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart's,
who is going thither: change of
ſcene will relieve my ſpirits, and wandering
give me perhaps a new reliſh for the
beauties of Devonſhire; where, believe me,
I ſhall be moſt happy to return, whenever
I can do it without ſubjecting my beſt
friends as well as myſelf to uneaſineſs."</p>
            <p>"I am vexed," ſaid Mr. Thorold,
"that the romantic temper of Montague
has made this removal neceſſary in your
idea. He goes very ſoon to Oxford: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in a few days: and afterwards, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
you would find my houſe leſs objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.
As to the goſſip of the country,
you are I hope too wiſe to mind it, and I
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0206900202:170"/>
have long ſince learned to deſpiſe it.
<hi>That,</hi> therefore ſhould not weigh with
me at all. But in return for your charming
ſincerity, I will ſpeak very plainly to you.
Montague is a young man of good abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and of an excellent heart; but the
violence of his paſſions keep me in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
concern leaſt they ſhould deprive me
of all the happineſs that I may hope to
derive from ſuch a ſon: and already I
have twice, with great difficulty, delivered
him from engagements he had made with
young women quite unworthy of him:
engagements which, though he ſoon ſaw
the folly and impropriety of them, he
fancied his honour obliged him to keep.
Another—I know not who; one perhaps
not much ſuperior to theſe, (as I learned by
a friend who keeps a ſteady eye upon him,)
had ſucceeded to the imaginary poſſeſſion
of his affections when he laſt came home.
I was uneaſy at it; but perhaps conſidered
my own feelings too much and your's too
little, when I ſaw with pleaſure his inſtant
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0206900202:171"/>
admiration of you. I encouraged it,
becauſe I hoped, that in learning what
true merit was, he would hereafter be leſs
liable to be miſled by the poor ſemblance
of it, when aided by a pretty face, or a
ſlender ſhape: at the ſame time I thought
I had ſufficiently guarded him againſt any
exceſs of attachment, by repreſenting to
him your ſituation and convincing him it
would be not only preſumptuous but hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
I believe, however, from ſome late
obſervations I have made, that I have
judged ill; and to ſave him from maladies
that might be trifling or curable, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
him to the ſeverer misfortune of
feeling a real paſſion where he can meet
with no return."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina could not with ſincerity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
what ſhe had ſo much reaſon to fear
was true. Affecting, however, to believe
that Mr. Montague would ſoon loſe the
impreſſion when ſhe was no longer preſent,
and would find many infinitely more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his affection, who might be proud
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0206900202:172"/>
to receive and at liberty to return it, ſhe
renewed the ſubject of her going to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
beſought Mr. Thorold ſtill to honour
her with his friendſhip, and promiſed to
return to him again in the winter if no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
ſhould ariſe to his receiving her.
She heard with gratitude the advice he
gave her about Vavaſour.—"Do not,"
ſaid he, "put yourſelf too much in his
power under the idea of his being the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
friend of Willoughby. He is called,
and I believe is, a man of honour, in the
common acceptation of the term; but I
am afraid there is little real honour among
thoſe who are in any reſpect ſo very licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
as Vavaſour is ſaid to be in regard to
your ſex; the ſtile in which he lives among
a certain deſcription of women, is not
only the means of degrading all in his
opinion, but hardens the heart while it
corrupts the morals: and with all Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour's
boaſted honour, I dare ſay he is a
man, who, if he happened to take a
fancy to the miſtreſs of his friend, would
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0206900202:173"/>
ſteal her affections and her perſon without
heſitation, and ſuppoſe, that by an appeal
to the ſword or piſtol to vindicate the
wrong he had done, the action, however
unprincipled, would derogate nothing
from his honour."</p>
            <p>"Sure, Sir," ſaid Celeſtina, "Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
would not have ſo much friendſhip
for Mr. Vavaſour were he ſuch a man?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know, my dear," anſwered
Mr. Thorold, "that Vavaſour is ſuch a
man; but you will allow at leaſt that it is
very probable; and as to Willoughby's
friendſhip, I am afraid that is no criterion of
merit. The college friendſhips of young
men—But let me not make you too
much out of humour with the world, while
I mean only to put you upon your guard
againſt the evil with which it too often
teems towards unprotected youth and
lovelineſs. It grieves my heart to let you
go. But—upon the whole, if you promiſe
to write to me often—to remain with this
ſiſter of Cathcart's, who is, I conclude, a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0206900202:174"/>
woman of character, and to take no new
courſe without informing me; above all,
to keep yourſelf quite out of the power of
Vavaſour, and not to be introduced to
any of his acquaintance by way of ſtaying
with them, unleſs you are very certain
who they are; I ſay, on all theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I will not oppoſe your going, though
it hurts me to conſent to it."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, having thus relieved her mind
by explaining herſelf to her generous friend,
became better ſatisfied than ſhe had been
for ſome time, and found at leaſt an alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation
of the concern that preyed on her
heart, in the idea of change of place. She
parted ſoon after from Mr. Thorold, whoſe
buſineſs ſhe was fearful of interrupting,
and walked back towards the houſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to open her intentions of leaving
them, to the reſt of the family, when they
were aſſembled to their tea.</p>
            <p>Montague, however, who had never
loſt ſight of her, but had followed her and
his father at a diſtance during their walk,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0206900202:175"/>
now haſtened acroſs the field ſhe was in to
meet her. His eagerly enquiring eyes
were fixed on her face when he came up
to her; but not daring to aſk the ſubject
of her conference with his father, nor able
to turn his thoughts from it, he only ſaid—"Well,
Miſs De Mornay, you have
left my father?"</p>
            <p>"You ſee I have," ſaid Celeſtina,
ſmiling, "and I have left him well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the reaſons I have given for quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his hoſpitable roof on Thurſday."</p>
            <p>"Quitting it!" exclaimed Montague,
turning pale—"quitting it! What are
you going to leave us then? and before I
go to Oxford?"</p>
            <p>"My good friend," replied ſhe, "you
did not ſurely ſuppoſe that I was to be a
perennial viſitor at your father's. I have
now been here almoſt a month, and you
muſt certainly allow that to be a very long
viſit from a perſon, who, till within five
weeks, had not the good fortune to be
known to your family at all."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0206900202:176"/>
"I know not," ſaid Montague, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
"what I thought, or what I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
but I would to heaven I could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
having ever ſeen you, as eaſily as I
am convinced you will loſe the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of me."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, with one of thoſe faſcinating
ſmiles which lent ſuch peculiar charms to
her countenance, now aſſured him that he
was miſtaken: "indeed," ſaid ſhe, "I
ſhall always remember you all, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and with gratitude."</p>
            <p>"Well," anſwered he, "I thank you;
and I thank you for not excepting me,
and by putting us all together, ſhewing
that you have no particular favourite in the
family, but that one is as indifferent as
another. But however, I wiſh you would
not ſmile, for I cannot bear it."</p>
            <p>"Ridiculous!" cried Celeſtina. "I
am amazed, Mr. Montague, that with
your underſtanding, you give way ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to ſuch abſurd fits of—I hardly
know what to call it—a romantic ſtile of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0206900202:177"/>
behaviour, which you ſeem to think wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
like, whereas I aſſure you that to me
at leaſt it is the moſt unpleaſant in the
world."</p>
            <p>"When did you ever ſee me in this ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic
ſtile, as you are pleaſed to term it,
with any woman but yourſelf?"</p>
            <p>"I never did, becauſe I happen not to
have ſeen you with any other women than
thoſe of your own family: but you know
that yout mother, your ſiſter and your
brother, nay, even your father, all have
repeatedly ſaid it was your way with every
body."</p>
            <p>"They are miſtaken however; and I
own <hi>I</hi> have often miſtaken a tranſient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of liking for love, which I never felt—no
never—till I ſaw you!</p>
            <q>
               <l>For ſeveral virtues</l>
               <l>Have I liked ſeveral women; never any</l>
               <l>With ſo full ſoul, but ſome defect in her</l>
               <l>Did quarrel with the nobleſt grace ſhe owed</l>
               <l>And put it to the foil: but you!—oh you!</l>
               <l>So perfect and ſo peerleſs, were created</l>
               <l>Of every creature's beſt.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0206900202:178"/>
"There now," ſaid Celeſtina, "that
is exactly what I complain of: there is no
rational converſation with you, capable as
you are of adorning it; but, as Arabella
very truly ſays, you do nothing but make
ſpeeches out of Otway or Shakſpeare."</p>
            <p>"Arabella did not ſay I made ſpeeches,
but that I made love; and I make love
becauſe I feel it—feel it to an exceſs which
is dreadful, becauſe I know, and have
known from the beginning, that it is
hopeleſs! But as this hurts nobody but
myſelf, I don't ſee why it ſhould diſpleaſe
you, or why you ſhould affect to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand,
or attempt to laugh off a
paſſion, which, whatever may be its effect
on me, can never diſturb your tranquillity
or that of your fortunate lover."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina finding him thus ſerious,
thought it would be better, and indeed
more generous, not to pretend ignorance
of his meaning, and to reaſon with rather
than rally him; ſhe therefore dropped the
gayer tone with which ſhe began the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0206900202:179"/>
and ſaid gravely—"Mr. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,
I will not affect then to miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
you. I am undoubtedly honoured
by your partiality, and very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
if it is the ſource of preſent pain to
you. Let it become rather a ſource of
pleaſure to us both, by reducing it to that
generous and diſintereſted friendſhip which
I may return with ſatisfaction, and for
thoſe warmer ſentiments, which you now
ſuppoſe are entirely diverted from any
other object, ſeek one who can deſerve
and return them, and ſpare me, I beſeech
you, the pain of believing, even for a
moment, that I have brought ſolicitude
and ſuffering into any part of a family to
which I am ſo much obliged. I need not
tell you my ſituation: you know it is a
very comfortleſs and a very uncertain one:
perhaps I may never ſee Mr. Willoughby
again; or if I do, perhaps I may ſee him
the huſband of another. But in either
caſe my attachment to him is unalterable;
and were I ſure to-morrow that we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0206900202:180"/>
never again to meet, I ſhould only
think of ſubmitting in ſuch a way as would
leaſt wound him, to a blow, which I am
ſure he will not voluntarily give me, but
never of running the hazard of making
unhappy ſome equally worthy man, by
giving to importunity what I can never
give to love—for my heart has been Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's
ever ſince I knew I had one,
and it will be his, till I remember it no
longer."</p>
            <p>Montague gave no other anſwer to this
than a deep ſigh; and Celeſtina pauſing a
moment to recover herſelf from the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
her words had occaſioned, went on—"You
love quotations, and undoubtedly
recollect, though perhaps from an author
I ought not to quote, theſe words: <hi>Il
n'y a point d'bomme pour celle qui aime;
ſon amant eſt plus, tous les autres ſont
moins.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Montague now impatiently interrupted
her—"You need not," ſaid he, "thus
refine on the cruelty with which you tell
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0206900202:181"/>
me that you can never throw away a
thought on me. I knew it before; and in
the wildeſt paroxyſms of that paſſion which
I glory in feeling and in cheriſhing, I
never dared flatter myſelf that you would.
Yet—perhaps even this fortunate Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
himſelf—this happy man, who
may neglect you, leave you for another,
and yet ſtill be beloved—is not more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of an ardent, a ſincere affection, than
I am. <hi>If</hi> he leaves you for ever—good
God!—Even if he entirely deſerts you,
you will ſtill love him—Even then no
other would have any hope."</p>
            <p>"None," ſaid Celeſtina, "for then I
will never marry. But, my good friend,
this is an uneaſy ſubject to us both; let us
then never reſume it. Allow me to offer
you my friendſhip and my eſteem, and to
aſſure you that this ſudden partiality, which
believe me you will ſoon and eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
is the only ſubject on which I cannot
liſten to you with pleaſure."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0206900202:182"/>
They were now ſo immediately before
the parlour windows, that Montague, who
ſaw the family aſſembled there at tea,
dared not give way to what he felt; but
aſked her, in a lower voice, when ſhe
went. She told him the day after the
morrow. Again he ſighed; and when
they got into the hall, turned towards his
own little ſtudy, which was on the ſame
floor, while Celeſtina went to join the
party in the parlour; where ſhe found Mr.
Bettenſon, who ſhe underſtood was now
the profeſſed lover of Miſs Thorold; and
ſo entirely did he now occupy the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
both of her and her mother, that they
hardly noticed the entrance of Celeſtina.
She took, however, the earlieſt opportunity
of a pauſe in their converſation, to ſignify
her deſign of going on the following Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
            <p>Miſs Thorold contented herſelf with
coldly ſaying ſhe was ſorry to loſe her ſo
ſoon; and her mother, even leſs civil, as
her huſband was not by, ſaid—"And
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0206900202:183"/>
pray, Miſs De Mornay, where are you
going?"</p>
            <p>"To London, Madam."</p>
            <p>"To London. Bleſs me! and pray who
are you going to there?"</p>
            <p>"To a Mrs. Elphinſtone, I believe,
Ma'am."</p>
            <p>"You believe! and pray when do you
go?"</p>
            <p>"On Thurſday, Madam."</p>
            <p>"And alone?"</p>
            <p>"No, Madam."</p>
            <p>"Not alone? then who do you go with?"</p>
            <p>"With Mr. Cathcart, Madam."</p>
            <p>"Oh! with Mr. Cathcart. And pray,
how do you go? In the ſtage?"</p>
            <p>"No, Madam," replied Celeſtina,
bluſhing at the indelicacy with which all
theſe queſtions were aſked before a ſtranger.</p>
            <p>"How then pray?"</p>
            <p>"In poſt chaiſes, Madam."</p>
            <p>"Humph! Poſt chaiſes are expenſive."
Here ſhe ſtopped; being unable to find
any other queſtions, or rather not daring
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0206900202:184"/>
to aſk any more, as her huſband and eldeſt
ſon that moment came in with Captain
Muſgrave. Celeſtina however interpreted
the look ſhe put on, as ſaying, "no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
how you go, ſo long as you do go,"
and again ſhe congratulated herſelf on the
reſolution ſhe had taken.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
            <p>CELESTINA, finding that Montague
Thorold did not join the party, conſtrained
herſelf to ſtay with them, leaſt it ſhould be
imagined they were together. Captain
Thorold, as if he took advantage of his
brother's abſence, ſat down by her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in a half whiſper to make her ſome of
thoſe ſpeeches, between a ſneer and a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which always confuſed and diſtreſſed
her. Soon after tea, however, Montague came
in, and then, the evening being rainy,
cards were propoſed, to which his mother
deſired him to ſit down; while Celeſtina,
ſaying ſhe had a few preparations to make
for her journey which ſhe might as well
begin in time, went away, nobody aſking
her to take a ſeat at the card table.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0206900202:186"/>
She was no ſooner gone, than Mrs. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
addreſſing her eldeſt ſon, ſaid—"So,
Edmund, we are to loſe your father's viſitor
at laſt, my dear."</p>
            <p>"Are we?" ſaid he careleſsly. "What
is her <hi>intended</hi> come back?"</p>
            <p>"Oh no," replied his mother, "the
young lady is going to London it ſeems."</p>
            <p>"Lord, Ma'am," cried Bettenſon,
"I'll tell you what Muſgrave and I heard
t'other day; did'nt we Muzzy?"</p>
            <p>"Faith I don't know whether we did or
no, Jacky Boy, till you tell me what it was
we heard."</p>
            <p>"Why we heard—Lord why 'twas that
night we drank tea and ſupped, you know,
with that there family of the Killigrews—we
heard that Mr. Montague Thorold was a
going to be married to this Miſs De Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and that Mr. What d'ye call him—he
that was to have had her, had given Mr.
Montague a living to take her off his
hands."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0206900202:187"/>
Either the purport of this ſpeech, or the
manner in which it was delivered, threw
Captain Thorold and his friend Muſgrave
into burſts of laughter, which they very
freely indulged; but poor Montague turned
pale, and trembled with vexation; while
Mrs. Thorold, purſing her mouth and
drawing herſelf up, ſaid—"Pray, Mr.
Bettenſon, <hi>where</hi> did you ſay you heard
this ſtory? Pray, Edmund, what do you
laugh at? I ſay—Mr. Bettenſon, pray was
it at Mr. Killigrew's you heard this abſurd
ſtory?"</p>
            <p>"Lord yes, Ma'am, and upon my ſoul
I've heard it elſewhere. Why, Muſgrave,
don't you remember?—why half the people
at Exeter I'm ſure have talked to me about
it."</p>
            <p>"I'm very ſorry for it," rejoined the
old lady. "People give their tongues
ſtrange liberties methinks. My ſon I can
aſſure them will never, at leaſt with mine
and his father's conſent, form any ſuch
connection. What! with a foreigner! an
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0206900202:188"/>
alien as one may ſay! brought up upon
charity, and I dare ſay not very honourably
born, or how did Mrs. Willoughby get
her ſo eaſily from her own country. People
of faſhion don't part with their children to
ſtrangers. For my part, I would be very
civil to a young woman in diſtreſs, as
'twas Mr. Thorold's whim to have her
here for a little time, but I am very ſorry
it has given riſe to any ſuch report, which
I beg the favour of you gentlemen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict.
A living indeed! it is very likely
that Montague Thorold ſhould accept of
a living with ſuch an incumbrance, or on
any ſuch conditions."</p>
            <p>"But Madam," cried Captain Thorold
as he dealt his cards, "what think you if
poor Montague avows his penchant for
the lady, and talks of dying without her
inſtead of getting a living with her?"</p>
            <p>"Think," replied his mother, redden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with anger—"why think that he is a
fool, and that you are very little better for
encouraging a ſilly boy in ſuch nonſenſe."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0206900202:189"/>
"Nay, Madam," cried the Captain, "I
am ſure I don't encourage him. I was
only pitying him, as one naturally does all
gentle youths who are croſt in love."</p>
            <p>Arabella, who knew that her mother
ſometimes ſuddenly threw off her every
day character to appear in one far leſs amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when unchecked by Mr. Thorold,
now feared that ſhe might give way to one
of theſe fits of ill humour and exhibit a
ſcene before Mr. Muſgrave and Mr. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſon
which might give them no very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
idea of the family temper; ſhe
therefore gave her brother Edmund a hint
to forbear puſhing the converſation any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He deſiſted; the game went in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Mrs. Thorold; and in the pleaſure
of winning five ſhillings, ſhe forgot for
that time the diſpleaſure ſhe had conceived
againſt her youngeſt ſon.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina was in the mean time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for her journey. She had nothing
now but her cloaths to pack up; for her
books and her drawing caſes were at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtone,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0206900202:190"/>
where Cathcart beſought her to
let them remain a little longer, promiſing
that if events were finally determined other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than he was ſtill willing to hope, he
would take them all from thence and ſend
them to her whitherſoever ſhe might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
She wiſhed moſt earneſtly the next
day over: for ſhe had now learned to dread
more than before ſome extravagance on the
part of Montague Thorold, for whom,
notwithſtanding the trouble ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from his continual perſecutions,
ſhe could not altogether withhold her pity
and her eſteem. In his figure he reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
his father, whom ſhe had ſo much
reaſon to regard with grateful affection;
and his faults were merely thoſe of youth
and a vivid imagination. Whether his
partiality to her was of a permanent or
tranſitory nature, it was pretty certain that
it now gave him pain, of which Celeſtina
could not conſider herſelf as the cauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deſiring to alleviate or rather to end it.
At ſupper, however, ſhe learned, with
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0206900202:191"/>
great ſatisfaction, that Mr. Thorold and his
two ſons were engaged out for the whole of
the next day, and were to leave home
early in the morning. She fancied, from
ſeveral remarks ſhe made in the courſe of
the evening, that this was purpoſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived:
and the eyes of Montague, though
he dared not otherwiſe ſpeak, told her
how cruelly he ſuffered from an arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which would deprive him of almoſt
all the opportunities of ſpeaking to her
which her ſhort ſtay might yet afford him.
Though he ſaw that his mother remarked
all his looks, and was reſtrained only by
the fear of offending his father from
openly avowing the anger ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
he could not forbear watching
every turn of Celeſtina's countenance; and,
when he bade her good night at the door,
ſighing deeply and ſaying in a low whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per—"At
what time do you go on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?"</p>
            <p>"Early I hope," replied ſhe; and to
avoid all farther queſtions haſtened away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0206900202:192"/>
The next day paſſed quietly enough:
for Mrs. Thorold, ſure of being delivered
from a viſitor who had never been agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and was now uneaſy to her, thought
it as well to be tolerably civil to her; and
Arabella, who thought very little about
any thing at preſent but ſecuring her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
over the heart of Mr. Bettenſon, was
hardly conſcious that ſhe was with them.</p>
            <p>Late in the evening the gentlemen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
but Celeſtina had left the parlour
before their arrival, on pretence of going
early to bed that ſhe might be ready the
next day for Mr. Cathcart, whom ſhe had
appointed to meet her in a poſt chaiſe at
ſix o'clock. She took leave of Mrs. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold
and her daughter therefore this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who received her thanks and adieus
with great formality and no kindneſs.
Very willingly would ſhe have eſcaped
bidding farewel to Montague Thorold the
next morning, but ſhe feared it would be
impoſſible: Mr. Thorold had told her he
ſhould himſelf put her into the chaiſe;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0206900202:193"/>
and he always roſe ſo early, that this, ſhe
knew, would not put him out of his way.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as her window was opened in
the morning, which was almoſt as ſoon as
it was light, ſhe ſaw Montague Thorold
ſtanding under it. He kiſſed his hand to
her when he perceived her, and looked ſo
dejected that ſhe could not ſee him without
concern. She was very ſoon dreſſed, and
went down into the parlour, where he no
ſooner ſaw her than he came to her.—"You
are ready even before the time, ſo
impatient are you to leave us," ſaid he in
a mournful voice. "Ah! Miſs De Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay!
this houſe then will never again be
bleſt with your preſence!"</p>
            <p>"Indeed, Sir, I hope to ſee it very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
again, and ſhall always be happy
to hear of the health and welfare of it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
But is your father in his ſtudy?
I muſt ſee him before I go."</p>
            <p>"Do not, Celeſtina," ſaid Montague
very gravely—"do not ſo induſtriouſly try
to deprive me of this laſt poor moment.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0206900202:194"/>
Yet a little—and my unfortunate, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
attachment will trouble you no more."</p>
            <p>"You are miſtaken, Mr. Montague,"
replied Celeſtina. "Any circumſtance
that <hi>you</hi> have occaſion to deem unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
will trouble <hi>me</hi> long, wherever and
whatever I may be: pray therefore, for
my ſake as well as for your own, exert
your excellent underſtanding, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
this unlucky partiality towards a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who, whatever may be her ſenſe of
your worth, or her gratitude for your good
opinion, can never return it otherwiſe than
by eſteem and good wiſhes."</p>
            <p>"I had rather you would hate, deteſt,
and drive me from you," cried he, ſtarting
up and going to the window: "'twould
be leſs cruel than this gentle reaſon, which
I know to be juſt, but which I cannot
obey: and yet indeed, Celeſtina, I have
no hope: I am not quite frantic enough
to ſuppoſe there can be any for me. All
I aſk is to be permitted to be miſerable,
and that, after all, you cannot prevent.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0206900202:195"/>
Yes, there is yet another favour I would ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit,
though I know—I know you will not
grant it."</p>
            <p>"Any thing I can do without impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,"
replied Celeſtina, "I certainly will
do."</p>
            <p>"I do not know," ſaid he, in a depreſſed
and ſolemn voice, "what <hi>you</hi> may call
propriety or impropriety; but the favour I
would ſolicit is to be allowed to write to
you.—Nay don't interrupt me with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
before you hear me—to be allowed
to write to you, ſo long as I confine my
letters to literary ſubjects only, and that
once or twice a year you would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the receipt of my letters."</p>
            <p>"My dear Sir," cried ſhe, ſmiling,
"you would be weary of this project long
before the firſt half year had elapſed.
Had you never talked to me of I know not
what particular regard, there might have
been no impropriety in this, and I am
ſure the pleaſure and advantage would have
been wholly mine; but after the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0206900202:196"/>
gallant things you have ſaid, how
can I—"</p>
            <p>"If I infringe the articles of our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,"
ſaid he, "then ſend my letters
back."</p>
            <p>"But tell me," cried Celeſtina, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him in her turn, "tell me what
good can this poſſibly do you?"</p>
            <p>"Good!" replied he: "you are not
yourſelf inſenſible of a tender attachment
to Willoughby, and yet aſk what <hi>good</hi> it
can do to be admitted to write to a beloved
object. Good! why it will be the ſoftener,
the ſweetener of my exiſtence! While I am
writing to you, I ſhall forget that I am
never to ſee you—I ſhall forget every thing
but the pleaſure of knowing that you will
read what I am writing, that your hands
will unfold my letter, your eyes paſs over
the traces of my pen; that ſometimes I
may amuſe or intereſt you, and at others,
perhaps, raiſe in your boſom a compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

            <p>Celeſtina had no time to anſwer this
otherwiſe than by ſaying, that if he had
ſagacity enough to find out where ſhe was
he poſſeſſed more than ſhe did, who could
not even gueſs where ſhe might be. He
anſwered that he could always know of
Cathcart; and before ſhe could urge the
many objections ſhe ſaw to his requeſt,
the chaiſe, with Cathcart in it, drove up
to the door, and at the ſame moment Mr.
Thorold came to them. He appeared ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
concerned that ſhe was going from
him; deſired her again to write to him;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0206900202:198"/>
and while he was haſtening breakfaſt,
which he inſiſted upon her taking before
ſhe went, Vavaſour rode into the court
yard, and giving his horſe to his ſervant,
came into the room alſo.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who knew that Cathcart had
informed him of her reſolution to go, had
felt ſome ſurpriſe that he had not called
upon her the day before to expreſs his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
and enquire how ſhe intended
to diſpoſe of herſelf: but he was ſo volatile
and inconſiderate, that ſhe thought it not
impoſſible but that he might have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
on Wedneſday what he ſo vehemently
urged on Monday; and ſhe now rather
wiſhed he had, as ſhe ſaw Mr. Thorold
was very little pleaſed either with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
viſit, or the manner in which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
her, without taking either of him or
his ſon quite ſo much notice as the laws of
civility required.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina had frequently remarked the
extreme inattention and diſregard, which,
as Vavaſour felt, he never choſe to take
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0206900202:199"/>
the trouble of concealing, for the opinions
of thoſe to whom he was indifferent; and
he was indifferent to three fifths of the
world, and not very ſolicitous about the
reſt, unleſs for a few, a very few friends,
whom he loved. He diſliked the Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolds,
without knowing or enquiring of
himſelf why he diſliked them; and eager
and ſolicitous only about Celeſtina, he
hardly gave her time to addreſs herſelf to
them, or returned their invitation to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of their breakfaſt by the uſual ſpeech.
A party who ſeemed ſo little pleaſed with
each other, Celeſtina thought could not
too ſoon ſeparate: ſhe therefore haſtily
drank her tea, and telling Cathcart ſhe
was ready, ſhe gave the elder Mr. Thorold
her hand, and thanked him, not without
emotion, for all the kindneſs he had ſhewn
her: ſhe then wiſhed Montague Thorold
health and happineſs, deſired him to offer
her compliments and acknowledgments to
his mother, ſiſter, and brother, and then
Mr. Thorold leading her, and Montague
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0206900202:200"/>
walking ſilently on her left hand, ſhe went
out and ſtepped into the chaiſe.</p>
            <p>Cathcart followed her, and Vavaſour
went round to ſpeak to her at the oppoſite
ſide. "You did not wiſh me good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,"
ſaid he, "and therefore I ſuppoſe
you foreſee that I intend going with you
part of the way."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina had no time to anſwer; for
Mr. Thorold offering his hand once more
to bid her adieu, ſhe gave it him, ſaying—"Adieu!
dear Sir; a thouſand and a
thouſand thanks and good wiſhes." Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,
who ſtood by his father, at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
caught her eye, and there was on
his countenance an expreſſion of ſorrow
which affected her ſo much, that under
the ſudden impulſe of concern and pity
ſhe held out to him the hand his father let
go.—"Farewel, Mr. Montague," ſaid
ſhe. He ſeized it eagerly, and held it as
if he would never part from it more:
but Cathcart at that moment bowing to the
gentlemen and bidding the poſtillion drive
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0206900202:201"/>
on, he was compelled to releaſe it, though
it was with a ſigh as if his heart was half
broken; and when the chaiſe drove off,
inſtead of following it with his eyes, he
turned away and went into his own room,
unable either to ſee Celeſtina go or Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
following her.</p>
            <p>The concern ſhe felt for him kept her
ſilent the greateſt part of the way to the
cottage near old Winnington's, where
Jeſſy was to meet them. Cathcart, who
was unhappy at the neceſſity of parting
from his wife, was not diſpoſed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
her; and though Vavaſour now and
then rode up to the door of the chaiſe and
talked, ſhe was not in ſpirits to anſwer
the gay nothings with which he addreſſed
her. The meeting with Jeſſy was more in
uniſon with her feelings. Jeſſy threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into the arms of her benefactreſs, from
whom ſhe had been ſo long divided, and
who ſhe now ſaw only for a moment before
they were to be ſeparated for a yet longer
time. Neither of them could ſay much,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0206900202:202"/>
for their hearts were full: but had they
been diſpoſed for converſation, Vavaſour,
who felt only pleaſure in having got Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
away from the Thorolds, was very
little inclined to give them an opportunity:
but in his rattling way rallied Jeſſy, and
then Celeſtina, whom he teazed about
Montague Thorold and his father, one of
whom he called her pedant and the other
her prieſt, till ſhe was half angry. Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart
at length, however, prevailed upon
him to leave the friends alone; and as
they walked together before the door of
the cottage, he enquired whether he had
any commands in London. "Oh none,
I thank you," replied Vavaſour, "for I
ſhall be there myſelf almoſt as ſoon as you.
Pray where does Miſs De Mornay intend
to lodge?"</p>
            <p>Cathcart declared himſelf entirely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;
and then, for the firſt time, from
ſome expreſſion or look of Vavaſour's, he
ſuddenly entertained a notion that there
was ſomething more than friendly ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0206900202:203"/>
for Willoughby's betrothed wife in
the eager and aſſiduous attentions of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour;
and he determined from that time
to remark more narrowly his behaviour to
her.</p>
            <p>"You do not intend to ſet out for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to-day, Sir?" enquired Cathcart.</p>
            <p>"Yes I do," anſwered Vavaſour: "that
is, I juſt ride back and make my bow to
thoſe honeſt humdrum Cranfields, and
then I am off for Oakhampton, where I've
told them I have buſineſs, and from thence
I ſhall take four horſes, and ſo come up
with you, my good fellow, and your fair
<hi>compagnon du voyage,</hi> before you reach Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niton."</p>
            <p>"And does Miſs De Mornay know of
your intentions, Sir?"</p>
            <p>"No; for I know what ſcalping ſavages
all the people about here are; and though
there can be nothing you know in my
attending her on behalf of Willoughby,
yet on her account one would not ſet the
clacks of the old cats within twenty miles
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0206900202:204"/>
round at work about it, and ſo I have
made up a ſtory of having a lawyer to meet
about the affairs of my deceaſed aunt, who,
luckily for the honour of my veracity, had
a farm or two near Oakhampton, which
are now mine; and I intend the Cranfields,
good matter of fact ſouls, ſhall fancy me
carefully looking after my property and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
repairs and renewals with Mr. Palmer
the attorney."</p>
            <p>"You intend, no doubt, to tell Miſs
De Mornay of it, however, Sir?"</p>
            <p>"Oh! yes, now I ſee her ſafely out of
the hands of her confeſſor, or elſe perhaps
he would have put it into her head that I
am not a fit eſcort for her; though I think,
Cathcart, thou art ſo grave and ſage that
thou'lt make as proper a third to our party
as his reverence himſelf. Come never look
ſo calamitous, but go and take leave of thy
weeping wife, and let me and Celeſtina
have a little converſation."</p>
            <p>Cathcart then went into the houſe, and
Celeſtina preſently afterwards came to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0206900202:205"/>
who continued walking before it.
"Has Cathcart told you my plan?" ſaid
he, before ſhe could ſpeak. "I intend to
go to London with you from Honiton,
where I ſhall be almoſt as ſoon as you."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina now recollected all Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold
had ſaid to her; but the great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
which had for ſo many years ſubſiſted
between Vavaſour and Willoughby, and
the undeſigning openneſs of Vavaſour's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
put all the ſuſpicions he had raiſed
to flight, even when this ſcheme ſeemed
moſt ſtrongly to corroborate thoſe ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions.
"I had much rather you would
not join us," ſaid Celeſtina, "becauſe,
though I ſhould certainly be glad of your
company as well as Mr. Cathcart, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a thouſand ill natured things may be
ſaid about it."</p>
            <p>She was proceeding, when Vavaſour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
her. "Yes, that's juſt the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
you have learned at the Thorolds.
What does it ſignify to you what any body
ſays or thinks but Willoughby, and you
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0206900202:206"/>
know that he would put you himſelf into
my protection on every occaſion where he
could not protect you himſelf. Come, come,
Celeſtina, acknowledge that your old Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
has been warning you againſt having
any acquaintance with ſuch ſad young rakes
as Vavaſour."</p>
            <p>"If you think ſo," replied Celeſtina,
"you undoubtedly know that he has rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for his precaution; and as for his calling
you what I always fancied you rather piqued
yourſelf upon being, I don't ſee why my
Mentor, as you term him, ſhould give you
offence by that."</p>
            <p>"Rake as I am, however," anſwered
he, "curſe me if I would do a diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thing towards George. No, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
not if I were dying for love of you."</p>
            <p>"I believe you indeed," ſaid Celeſtina;
"and ſuch perfect confidence I have in
your honour, that I ſhould truſt myſelf with
you as with a brother."</p>
            <p>"And never, you dear candid angel,"
interrupted he, "never ſhall you repent
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0206900202:207"/>
that confidence. But I tell you very plainly,
that though I am upon honour with Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
I am not ſo with thoſe Thorolds,
and can allow nobody elſe to uſurp that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
which perhaps I might have taken it
into my head to diſpute even with my friend
George himſelf if he had not made out a
very early and almoſt an hereditary claim
to you: as it is, however, I have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
for myſelf, but I am confoundedly
jealous for him; and now I have got you
out of the way of that prating, piping,
poetical pedant—that Montague Thorold,
I ſhall be quite eaſy when I ſee you ſituated
where you are not very likely to meet with
him again: ſo you won't oppoſe my
meeting you on the road; and, till then,
my ſweet friend, adieu!" He then, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
waiting for an anſwer, ran to his horſe,
which his ſervant was leading about, and
mounting it, was out of ſight in an inſtant.
Cathcart and Jeſſy then came towards Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina;
and the latter hanging on her neck,
could hardly prevail on herſelf to bid her
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0206900202:208"/>
farewel; while Celeſtina, melting into
tears, kiſſed her, and willing to ſhorten a
ſcene ſo uſeleſsly painful, ſtepped into the
chaiſe, where Cathcart, having taken again
a tender leave of his wife, immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
her, and they took the road that led
acroſs the commons to the turnpike.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
            <p>THE road they were travelling led
along the ſide of Alveſtone Park for near a
mile and a half. Celeſtina had never
paſſed it before, but on the day when Mr.
Thorold had taken her to his houſe; and
then ſhe had been ſo loſt in mournful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
as hardly to notice whither ſhe
went. Now, however, the profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
ſhe had fallen into on parting from
Jeſſy, was ſuddenly broken by an excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
for on looking up, ſhe ſaw one
of the park gates, and cried—"Alveſtone!
is it not?—oh! yes, I ſee it is: there is the
houſe!" Cathcart anſwered that it was;
and after another ſhort ſilence, Celeſtina
ſaid—"To any body but you, Cathcart,
I ſhould be afraid of betraying my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0206900202:210"/>
but you are now in place of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to me, and knowing my ſituation, will
indulge my regret: I have a ſtrange fancy
to get out and go up to that tuft of beech
trees on the brow of the hill. It is not far.
I ſhall not be gone long. Will you wait
for me?"</p>
            <p>"My time is your's," replied he. "But
will you allow me to obſerve that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
wiſer to endeavour to conquer this
uſeleſs regret than to indulge it?"</p>
            <p>"I know it would be wiſer," anſwered
Celeſtina: "but alas! we are not always
able to be wiſe. I think I ſhall be eaſier
when I have once more taken, of that ſpot
where I have often been ſo happy—a laſt
adieu!"</p>
            <p>"Heaven forbid it ſhould be the laſt,"
cried Cathcart, as he aſſiſted her to leave
the chaiſe. "I foreſee many, many happy
days for you yet, when you will be miſtreſs
of that houſe."</p>
            <p>"Ah! dear Cathcart," returned Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
half ſmiling through the tears that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0206900202:211"/>
filled her eyes, "how happy a convert
ſhall I be to the doctrine of ſecond ſight if
your prophecy ſhould ever be fulfilled.
But no; I feel too certainly that this is the
laſt time I ſhall ever behold this dear place."</p>
            <p>She then went into the park over the
ſtepping ſtile, and walking about half a
quarter of a mile, reached the group of
beech trees which ſhaded a high knoll in
the park; from whence the houſe, half
concealed by intervening wood, appeared
to great advantage. It was now the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of May, and the trees under which
ſhe ſtood were juſt coming into leaf, while
others ſcattered over the park were many
of them of the moſt vivid green, contraſted
by the darker ſhade of fir and cypreſs min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
among them. One of the trees of
this clump was marked by Willoughby
with her name, his own, and his ſiſter's,
and the date. It was five years ſince; and
the bark had grown rough and knotted
round the ſcars, but the letters ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained.
It was to re-viſit this well known
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0206900202:212"/>
memorial that Celeſtina had been anxious;
and now ſhe could hardly bear the thoughts
of leaving it. She recollected every trifling
circumſtance that happened when Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
cut thoſe letters: the cloaths he
wore, and his very look, were again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to her; while in the breeze that
ſighed among the trees ſhe fancied ſhe
heard the ſound of his voice, and that he
pronounced the name of Celeſtina. In
this ſtate of mind ſhe had almoſt forgotten
that Cathcart waited for her; till a herd
of deer ran bounding by her, and looking
up, ſhe ſaw following them in mimic race,
ſeveral horſes which grazed in the park.
There was among them a favourite little
mare, which Willoughby had been fond of
from a boy: it had always carried him to
Eton, and been the companion of all his
boyiſh ſports; and when it became old,
had been turned into the park in ſummer
and carefully ſheltered in winter. While
Mrs. Willoughby lived, it had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to be fed with bread once or
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0206900202:213"/>
twice a day from her hand, from her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's,
or Celeſtina's; and ſince her death
the old ſervants in the houſe, with whom
it was a ſort of cotemporary, had accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
it to the ſame indulgence; to which
it had become ſo habituated, that on ſight
of any of the family it went towards them
to be fed. This creature therefore no
ſooner ſaw Celeſtina's cloaths fluttering
among the trees, than it left it's compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and came neighing towards her.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina fancied the animal remembered
her. She careſſed it fondly, and with tears
in her eyes, and a deep ſigh, cried—"Ah!
Fanchette, you recollect then your old
friend, when perhaps your ſtill beloved
maſter is trying to forget her, and may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
have ſucceeded but too well." She
found herſelf too much affected with this
idea, and turning her ſwimming eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the houſe, the contraſt between
what ſhe now was, and what, hardly a
month ſince, ſhe expected to be—the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
apprehenſion that Willoughby had ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0206900202:214"/>
become a convert to avarice and
ambition, and that Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
who had the power to gratify both thoſe
paſſions, would ſoon poſſeſs the place
where ſhe had fondly hoped to conſtitute
the happineſs of <hi>his</hi> life whoſe happineſs
was dearer to her than her own—all
crouded with cruel force on her mind; and
feeling her ſenſations become more and
more painful, ſhe tore herſelf from the
ſpot which had ſo forcibly preſented them,
Fanchette ſtill following, and importuning
her to be fed. She walked ſlowly towards
the park gate, and ſaw Cathcart, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be uneaſy at her ſtay, coming to
meet her. He underſtood the nature of
her ſenſations too well to make any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries;
but offering her his arm, in ſilence
led her towards the chaiſe. Before ſhe
aſcended the ſteps of the ſtile, ſhe turned
once more to look at the horſe; kiſſed the
ſenſible animal as it licked her hands; and
pronouncing a half ſtifled and tremulous
"adieu Fanchette!" ſhe got as haſtily as
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0206900202:215"/>
ſhe could into the chaiſe, and deſired
Cathcart to order the poſtillion on quickly.
"Since I muſt go," ſaid ſhe, "I would
be ſoon out of ſight of this place, for I
find I cannot bear it."</p>
            <p>"I feared indeed," replied Cathcart,
"it would too much affect you."</p>
            <p>Both then returned to their former ſilence;
while Celeſtina, as her thoughts went back
to paſt pleaſures, and as her heart felt all
the bitterneſs of diſappointed hope, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
herſelf without reſtraint in the ſad
luxury of ſorrow. She no longer ſaw the
objects ſhe paſſed, or thought of whither
ſhe was going: but Alveſtone was ſtill
preſent to her eyes, and ſhe ſaw Willoughby
wandering among it's ſhades as if looking
for loſt happineſs, and returning diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to his houſe; whence the ſullen
magnificence and arrogant ſuperiority of
his haughty heireſs had driven all domeſtic
comfort. She heard him ſigh forth too late
his regret, and lament that for advantages
he could not enjoy, he had relinquiſhed the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0206900202:216"/>
competence he might have poſſeſſed, with
the tender attachment and grateful affection
of his Celeſtina. Tears fell ſlowly down
her cheeks as theſe diſtreſſing images pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
themſelves, and inſenſibly the tender
adieu ſhe had taken of the place, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
wiſhes ſhe had formed for the lamented
friend and lover to whom it belonged, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged
themſelves into verſe, and produced
the following</p>
            <q>

This diſpoſition of mind, mournful as
it was, afforded Celeſtina ſo much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
indulgence, that it was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly
ſhe was rouſed from it by their
reaching Honiton; where ſhe was glad to
find Vavaſour not yet arrived: for though
ſhe was ſenſible of the friendly intereſt he
took in whatever related to her, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
it to no other motive than regard
for Willoughby, and pity for her own ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
there was an impetuoſity in his
manner, and a freedom in his diſcourſe,
which, though it did not offend her becauſe
ſhe knew it was his uſual way with every
body, was yet often oppreſſive to her, and
ſince Mr. Thorold's caution, had become
more ſo than before. She obſerved too,
that Cathcart was not pleaſed at his purpoſe
of accompanying them to London, and
had expreſſed more than once, in the little
converſation they had together during their
journey, his hope, that ſhe would find his
ſiſter, Mrs. Elphinſtone, ſuch a companion
as might engage her to continue with her.—
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0206900202:218"/>
Celeſtina, who was, perhaps, a little too
faſtidious in the choice of her company,
from having in her early years had her
taſte ſet very high by Mrs. Willoughby,
was become generally indifferent now, from
the little expectation ſhe formed of being
gratified, and though her overcharged
heart languiſhed for the ſoothing pleaſure
of unburthening itſelf to ſuch a friend as the
ſimple and ſenſible Jeſſy, ſhe knew it was
very improbable that any one whom ſhe
might meet ſhould replace her. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
Cathcart, however, that ſhe doubted
not Mrs. Elphinſtone's merit, ſince ſhe was
his ſiſter, and was greatly prejudiced in her
favour by Jeſſy's account of her. "But,
my dear Sir," ſaid ſhe, "it is I who have
the greateſt reaſon to doubt of my recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and I have thought ſince, the plan
we haſtily formed a very wild one. Mrs.
Elphinſtone, occupied by her family, may
have as little occaſion for a companion as
taſte for an intruder into her domeſtic cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;
and ſhe may perhaps, on your recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0206900202:219"/>
accept, what her own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be averſe to receive. Beſides ſhe
has a huſband, of whom I know nothing,
and to whom the preſence of a ſtranger,
when he expects only his wife and family,
may be diſagreeable. I own I have thought
of a journey into the North with more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
than any thing elſe can now give me,
for it is the only part of this iſland I have
not ſeen ſomething of, in thoſe ſummer
excurſions which my dear Mrs. Willoughby
was fond of making. But with whatever
ſatisfaction my fancy has dwelt upon it, I
ought not to think of it farther, at leaſt till
I have ſeen your ſiſter."</p>
            <p>Cathcart repeated again and again his
aſſurances of the happineſs her company
would beſtow on his ſiſter, and continued
to lay plans for the accommodation of their
journey: while Celeſtina could not but
think with internal anguiſh on her very
forlorn ſituation, compelled to ſolicit the
friendſhip and protection of ſtrangers, or
remain alone, unfriended and unprotected.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0206900202:220"/>
She bleſt, however, again the fortunate
chance that had brought her acquainted
with Jeſſy and Cathcart, without whom her
condition would be yet more deſolate; and
for once ſaw evidently the laſting good that
had been produced by a tranſient evil, the
troubleſome impertinence of Mr. Jedwyn.</p>
            <p>As they arrived at Honiton ſooner than
they expected, Celeſtina propoſed going
on as far as Axminſter, nine miles farther,
before they dined. To this Cathcart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented;
heſitating however a moment whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ought not to wait for Vavaſour.
Celeſtina ſeemed averſe to it, and ſaid if
there was any rudeneſs in their going on
without him, ſhe would herſelf be anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for it.</p>
            <p>They proceeded therefore to Axmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and were juſt ſet down to their dinner,
when Vavaſour, at the expence of almoſt
killing the four horſes which drew him, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
            <p>His volatile humour never forſook him,
and he ſeemed now unuſually diſpoſed to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0206900202:221"/>
indulge it. He gave the moſt ludicrous
account of the manner in which he had
miſled the curioſity of Mrs. Cranfield, by
ſetting out very gravely for Oakhampton;
and then cried—"Oh! and I tell you
who I met as I rode back to Cranfield's;
your languiſhing lover, Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
looking, poor dog! ſo diſtanced and
ſo diſmal: he was compoſing, I fancy, an
elegy on your departure, for I rode almoſt
againſt him in the croſs lane that leads
from old Thorold's grounds towards Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field
Hall, and he had a paper in his hand,
on which he was ſo intent that he did not
ſee me, till I awakened him with a ho hoop!
ho hoop! as if I had been in at the death.
He ſtarted, and I was afraid, as I might
have ſpoiled a thought, that he would feel
ſome poetical indignation; but inſtead of
that, he popped the paper into his boſom,
as if he feared I ſhould have ſeized it;
and then, with as much humility as if I
had been the head of his college, he
pulled off his hat, and profeſſing himſelf
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0206900202:222"/>
glad to ſee me, enquired where I had left
you: I told him on your way to London,
and that I was going back to Cranfield's;
and we parted with the utmoſt politeneſs."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who had really a friendſhip
for Montague Thorold, could not hear of
his anxious ſolicitude for her, without a
mingled ſentiment of regard and concern,
which, as her face expreſſed every emotion
of her heart, was immediately perceived by
the quick and penetrating eyes of Vavaſour.
He did not ſpare her; but rallied her with
more ſucceſs than politeneſs on the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
this college lad, for ſo he choſe to
term him, had obtained over her. "Upon
my word," ſaid he, "I ſhall think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to put Willoughby upon his guard
a little."</p>
            <p>"And how do you know, Sir," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
Celeſtina, "that Mr. Willoughby
will thank you for it? or, that admitting
Mr. Montague Thorold was really more to
me than a common acquaintance, which
you do not ſeriouſly believe, how are you
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0206900202:223"/>
ſure that your friend would not be rather
pleaſed, that the affections he may wiſh to
be troubled with no more, are transferred
to another?"</p>
            <p>"Transferred!" exclaimed Vavaſour.
"You admit then that ſuch a transfer is
probable?"</p>
            <p>"Not probable at all: but certainly it
would with moſt people be poſſible."</p>
            <p>"And if it were with you, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that Montague Thorold is not the
man to whom Willoughby would wiſh them
to be transferred."</p>
            <p>"He could, however, have very little
pretence, after having reſigned them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to dictate to whom they ſhould be
given. But of what uſe, Mr. Vavaſour, is
all this argument? Whether I ſhall ever
ſee Willoughby again or no is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
but it is very certain that if I do not,
I ſhall never marry at all."</p>
            <p>Vavaſour ſaw he had gone too far; and
Cathcart at that moment returning to them
to ſay the chaiſes were ready, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0206900202:224"/>
dropped for that time; Celeſtina pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
reſiſting the efforts Vavaſour
made to induce her to go at leaſt the next
ſtage, in the chaiſe with him.</p>
            <p>They reached Dorcheſter that evening;
and Celeſtina, after a ſlight ſupper, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of being a good deal fatigued with
her journey, and going as ſoon as ſhe could
to her chamber, left the two gentlemen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, naturally unreſerved, even to
indiſcretion, and ſeldom taking the trouble
to conceal his ſentiments, was totally off
his guard when he had drank five or ſix
glaſſes of wine; and ſince Willoughby,
who alone had the power to reſtrain any of
his exceſſes, had been leſs with him, he
had accuſtomed himſelf to take more than
double that quantity when he either dined
or ſupped. Celeſtina was no ſooner gone
therefore, than he ordered in another bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of claret, and before it was finiſhed, he
had told Cathcart without reſerve all that
he thought. Taking occaſion to toaſt
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0206900202:225"/>
Celeſtina, he ſaid—"Tell me, Frank!
what do you think of her? Is ſhe not a
charming girl?"</p>
            <p>"Moſt undoubtedly," replied Cathcart,
ſhe appears ſo to me, who know that her
very lovely perſon is the leaſt of her merit;
to me, who owe her more than life, and
who throughout mine ſhall have reaſon to
bleſs the hour that firſt threw my Jeſſy in
her way."</p>
            <p>"Yes, by heaven," cried Vavaſour, "ſhe
is an angel, and I cannot for my ſoul gueſs
at this ſtrange myſterious buſineſs of
George's leaving her: for though it is a
deſperate undertaking for a man to marry
at all, yet he had got over that, and doated
upon her to a degree that I never imagined
poſſible till I ſaw them together. I cannot
underſtand it; and the more I think about
it, the more incomprehenſible it becomes.
Tell me, Cathcart, do you think he will
now ever marry her?"</p>
            <p>"My dear Sir," replied Cathcart, "I
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0206900202:226"/>
can only ſay with you, that the more I
think, the leſs I comprehend of the affair."</p>
            <p>"I'll tell you, Frank: I am pretty well
perſuaded that he never will marry her;
nay, that he has made up his mind to tie
himſelf to the fifteen thouſand a year, and
the Viſcount's title, which are the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages
of his couſin: yet why, unleſs he
had fully determined againſt all the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
that match offered him—why carry
matters ſo far with Celeſtina? and who the
devil could thoſe two women be who it
ſeems put the matter by and ſent him off
in ſuch a hurry?"</p>
            <p>"I never could find out," replied Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart.
"He was himſelf the only perſon
who knew, and of him, as he avoided all
explanation, I could not enquire."</p>
            <p>"What! did you never aſk whether
they were young or old?"</p>
            <p>"I aſked; but the people hardly ſaw
their faces. They came in the evening,
and went away in the middle of the night;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0206900202:227"/>
but from the little information I could
make out, neither of them appeared young."</p>
            <p>"I ſhould have thought, (for you fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that affect principle are not always to
be depended upon,) that George had got
into ſome filly ſcrape or other with ſome
wench that he might have promiſed to
marry: but any ſuch entanglement might
have been eaſily got rid of, without his
flying away from Celeſtina or even from
his country. Well! there is no making
it out: but I believe it is clear enough that
Celeſtina will now never be <hi>his</hi> wife, and
that being once aſcertained, Cathcart, do
you know ſhe is the only woman upon
earth whom I ſhall ever think of making
mine?"</p>
            <p>"Your's Sir!" exclaimed Cathcart.</p>
            <p>"Aye, mine, Sir. I own 'tis rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
that even my divine Celeſtina
ſhould make <hi>me</hi> meditate on matrimony;
but ſuch a wonder was worthy of her only,
and ſhe has effected it. I never was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
half an hour in my life about any
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0206900202:228"/>
woman till I ſaw her at Alveſtone, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
till I became acquainted with her; for
I have ſeen perhaps handſomer women, or
at leaſt thoſe that were at firſt view more
ſtriking. Faith I found myſelf growing ſo
curſed fooliſh about her, that ſuppoſing
her then to be on the eve of marriage with
my friend George, I thought it beſt to fly
for it, and by going back to my old
haunts—you know my way—I got her out
of my head a little, and could have ſeen
her Willoughby's wife coolly enough; but
the moment I heard he had left her, this
confounded love, I ſuppoſe you call it,
began to play the devil with me again, and
I could not be eaſy, knowing the folks ſhe
was with, without coming down to ſee
after her. However Captain Thorold, (it
was that puffing fellow I was moſt afraid
of,) had not, I believe, the leaſt intereſt."</p>
            <p>"Nor will any man have it, I fancy,"
replied Cathcart: "at leaſt I am ſure that
nothing leſs than the certainty of Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's
marriage with another, would
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0206900202:229"/>
for a moment detach her from the invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
affection ſhe has for him. I even queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
if that would make any alteration in
her heart, though it might in her proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects."</p>
            <p>"Pooh, pooh," cried Vavaſour, "you
have not ſtudied women I find. Celeſtina
has too much ſpirit and too much ſenſe to
mope away her youth and beauty, and
dwindle into the neglected uglineſs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
maidenhood, becauſe Willoughby
did not know his own mind. Her pride,
and ſhe is not without it, will help her to
get the better of an attachment which will
only be a ſource of mortification to her.
No, no, let me be once ſure that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
gives her up, and I don't think
it very preſumptuous to ſay, that in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
afterwards I carry her, to Ortney-bury,
Mrs. Vavaſour."</p>
            <p>"'Till then, however, Sir," ſaid Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart—"till
you are quite ſure that all is at
an end between Mr. Willoughby and Miſs
De Mornay, you will of courſe hold it a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0206900202:230"/>
point of honour not to declare your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.
It will diſtreſs her extremely if
you do. For thinking of you as I know
ſhe thinks, ſhe will conclude you are very
certain that all ties are diſſolved between
them, or you would not addreſs her in a
way, which, while thoſe ties are undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
ſhe will call a breach of honour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your friend."</p>
            <p>"Aye, that's all very true," replied
Vavaſour. "But let her take care then
how ſhe ſhews a diſpoſition to favour that
ſucking parſon—that Montague Thorold.
Though I'm willing to allow Willoughby
the preference, I am by no means diſpoſed
to give the pas to ſuch a green horn as
that: and to tell you the truth, Frank, If
I were ſure ſhe preferred him I might
commit ſome d—d folly or other."</p>
            <p>"Well, Sir," cried Cathcart, riſing to
wiſh him good night, "ſhe is not likely
to be in his way; and if ſhe were I am
very certain Mr. Willoughby has nothing
to fear from him; and as to yourſelf you
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0206900202:231"/>
know, you agree, that while <hi>he</hi> is in queſtion
<hi>you</hi> are entirely out of it."</p>
            <p>Cathcart then left him to finiſh another
bottle alone, and carried with him no very
agreeable reflections. Notwithſtanding all
that had paſſed he could not diveſt himſelf
of the hope of ſeeing Celeſtina united to
Willoughby, whom alone he thought
worthy of her. His own competence and
happineſs, which they only had given him,
would, he felt, be incomplete if both or
either of them were unhappy; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
he thought they muſt be if they
lived not for each other. Whatever
ſcheme therefore interfered with a union he
ſo much deſired, he felt as a ſort of injury
to himſelf; and though the extreme good
humour, generous ſpirit, and gay temper
of Vavaſour, made it impoſſible to diſlike
him, Cathcart was convinced, from the
little he knew of his manner of life and his
very free principles, that were Willoughby
wholly ſet aſide, he was a man with whom
the ſenſibility and purity of mind of Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0206900202:232"/>
would never allow her to be happy:
he foreſaw, therefore, nothing but uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for her in his intended purſuit of her,
and thought with redoubled anxiety of
her ſituation.</p>
            <p>As early the following morning as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour
could be prevailed upon to move,
they renewed their journey; and about ſix
o'clock that evening, having taken leave
of Vavaſour in Piccadilly, (who took Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart's
directions, in order to be with them
the next morning,) Celeſtina was ſet down
at the lodgings Mrs. Elphinſtone had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to in Suffolk-ſtreet, Charing Croſs.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
            <p>CATHCART had given his ſiſter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the arrival of Celeſtina, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the joy with which Mrs. Elphinſtone
received her brother and the lovely perſon
to whom he had been ſo much obliged,
was unallayed by the ſurpriſe ſhe might
have felt at the unexpected entrance of a
ſtranger.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina was extremely pleaſed with her
new acquaintance, and very ſoon forgot
that ſhe ſaw her for the firſt time. Her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
was very tall and thin, and would have
had as much dignity as ſymmetry but that
an habitual though ſlight ſtoop ſeemed to
beſpeak oppreſſion of ſpirit and the weight
of many ſorrows. Her face very much
reſembled that of Cathcart; but the bloom
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0206900202:234"/>
of youth and the glow of health were gone:
ſtill it was intereſting, though languid and
faded. Her eyes were eminently beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and there was an air of mild reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
over her whole countenance particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
touching, which, even in her moſt
cheerful moments, beſpoke her rather ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to bear the evils ſhe ſeemed to
foreſee, than capable of enjoying the paſſing
pleaſure. Sorrow had left on her expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
features marks of it's cruel power, and
had anticipated the hand of time: for
though ſhe was not yet thirty, ſhe appeared
four or five years older; and her dreſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
nothing to undeceive the imagination,
for it was ſo plain that nothing but it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
neatneſs and finer linen diſtinguiſhed
her from women in the humbleſt rank
of life. Her manners, however, would, in
any dreſs or any ſituation of life, have
marked her for a well educated woman;
and her voice was particularly pleaſing to
Celeſtina, who had been wearied by the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0206900202:235"/>
harſh monotony of Mrs. Thorold or the
affected liſp of her daughter.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina had not been an hour in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with Mrs. Elphinſtone, before ſhe
not only determined on going to Scotland
with her if it were practicable, but felt ſo
uneaſy in the fear of a diſappointment that
ſhe wiſhed to have it immediately diſcuſſed.
Cathcart, who eaſily underſtood her, then
began to talk the matter over with his ſiſter,
and found, that from the hint of it which
he had before given her, ſhe had been aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duouſly
removing every objection that
could ariſe. She anſwered for Mr. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
whom Cathcart had before deſcribed
to Celeſtina as good natured even to a fault,
and ſo fond of ſociety as to have owed
great part of his misfortunes to a paſſion
for it; and Celeſtina, willing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of what ſhe wiſhed to believe, no
longer heſitated. Nothing then remained
but to prepare for their departure, which
was fixed to be at the diſtance of two days.
Cathcart undertook every preparation; and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0206900202:236"/>
having ſettled every thing as far as it could
be that evening, he took leave of Celeſtina,
for whom Mrs. Elphinſtone had procured
an apartment in the ſame houſe, and went
to a coffee houſe, where he had beſpoke
a bed, promiſing to be with them the next
morning.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina early on that morning aroſe
to write the letter ſhe had long meditated
to Willoughby. She was now able to give
ſuch reaſons for her quitting Mr. Thorold
as he could not diſapprove; and though
he might perhaps think her preſent plan a
ſtrange one, he would be eaſy, ſhe thought,
in the reflection that it was attended with
no perſonal danger and that ſhe was with
Cathcart's ſiſter. One only objection now
ſtruck her, and that was the length of time
which muſt elapſe before ſhe could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his letters: but on the other hand, if
the ſtrange obſtacles to their meeting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
it was uncertain whether he
would write to her; and if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
ſhe hoped that he would fly to her
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0206900202:237"/>
with equal eagerneſs whether ſhe was in
Devonſhire or in the extreme parts of
Scotland. She collected, therefore, every
thing her tenderneſs ſuggeſted to make
Willoughby eaſy about her if he ſtill loved
her, and was ſhedding involuntary tears
over that painful doubt, when, as ſhe had
juſt concluded her letter, Vavaſour very
abruptly entered the dining room, where
Mrs. Elphinſtone had not yet taken her
ſeat, being detained by the care of her four
children, whom ſhe attended to entirely
herſelf.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour entered with the gay confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a welcome viſitor; but was a little
diſconcerted by the languid coldneſs with
which Celeſtina received him, and by the
air of melancholy ſhe aſſumed, and the
traces of recent tears which he obſerved on
her cheeks. He enquired if ſhe was not
writing to Willoughby; and on her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
"yes," aſked her what ſhe had ſaid
to him of her future intentions as to reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0206900202:238"/>
"I have told him," replied ſhe, "that
I am going to Scotland."</p>
            <p>"To Scotland! impoſſible! you are
laughing at me."</p>
            <p>"Indeed I am going to Scotland," ſaid
ſhe; "and I thought you had known it."</p>
            <p>"To Scotland! No, I imagined you
would take lodgings either in London or
it's neighbourhood, and wait for letters
from George, which muſt ſoon be here and
be certainly deciſive."</p>
            <p>"That is by no means certain," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
Celeſtina; "and whatever the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of thoſe letters may be, I may hear it
there as well as here."</p>
            <p>Vavaſour now enquired more minutely
into her plan; againſt which he firſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
his whole powers of ridicule, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wild, romantic, unpleaſant, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
of nothing but diſappointment and
fatigue; but finding Celeſtina proof againſt
all the ludicrous lights in which he could
repreſent it, he became ſerious, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
inveighed againſt the folly and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0206900202:239"/>
of a journey to the moſt deſolate and
dreary country of Britain, to reſide with
people whom ſhe did not know, and who
were themſelves only adventurers on a wild
and ſpeculative ſcheme that would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be abortive. He repreſented very
forcibly the diſcomforts ſhe muſt meet
with, and the little pleaſure or knowledge
which the view of ſuch a country could
offer to counterbalance them: but ſhe was
as indifferent to local circumſtances as to
the ridicule of thoſe who would, he ſaid,
laugh at her pilgrimage to the ſhrine of
St. Columba; and he had exhauſted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all his arguments without making any
alteration in her reſolution, when the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of Mrs. Elphinſtone and Cathcart
obliged him to deſiſt.</p>
            <p>From their converſation he had the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of hearing that every thing would
be ready for their journey the next day but
one, and of finding that Cathcart never
ſuppoſed he meant to object to any plan of
Celeſtina's, who was entirely miſtreſs of her
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0206900202:240"/>
actions. Unuſed to any oppoſition, Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
could hardly brook it, even from thoſe
who were his equals; and though he had
hitherto behaved to Cathcart as if he had
conſidered him as ſuch, his ſpirit now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
at what he thought the oppoſition of
an inferior and a dependant. He became
ſilent during breakfaſt, and was very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
diſpleaſed; and as ſoon as he could
he deſired Cathcart to walk with him for
half an hour in the Park. He there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
very warmly againſt Celeſtina's
going, and urged, among many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
the objections Willoughby would
make to it. Cathcart, convinced from
this converſation that it was neceſſary for
her to be removed as far as poſſible from
Vavaſour, kept his temper, and referred
his impetuous opponent to Celeſtina her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
He went back, therefore, to Mrs.
Elphinſtone's lodgings to make another
effort, but had the additional mortification
of finding the ladies gone out to make pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes,
and all his ſubſequent attempts that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0206900202:241"/>
day to ſee them were abortive. The next, he
attended very early at their door, and ſaw
a chaiſe there, into which he found them
almoſt inſtantly ſtepping, to dine at Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
with an old relation of Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone's and Cathcart's, of whom it
was neceſſary for the former to take leave;
and all Vavaſour's diſregard for forms could
not authoriſe his intruding himſelf upon
them there. He called in the evening in
Suffolk-ſtreet, but they were not returned;
and was there again at ten o'clock, and
told they were gone to bed. At day
break the next morning he propoſed to
beſet the door, though almoſt hopeleſs now
of detaining Celeſtina. The habits of life,
however, he was accuſtomed to, and ſome
additional wine drank the evening before
to conquer his vexation; contributed to
keep him long after day break from being
on the watch; and on his arrival about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
o'clock, he learned from Cathcart,
who was juſt ſetting out for Devonſhire
with the two little girls and a ſervant he
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0206900202:242"/>
had hired to take care of them, that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
and his ſiſter had been gone above
two hours, and were probably many miles
on the North road. Vavaſour received this
intelligence with indignation and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which Cathcart pretended not to
obſerve; and buſying himſelf in placing
his little girls in the chaiſe and ſettling
their baggage, he in a few moments wiſhed
Vavaſour a good morning, and left him to
curſe his deſtiny at his leiſure, which he did
very liberally for ſome moments; and
then determining to think no more of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
he plunged, in order to forget her,
into thoſe ſcenes where he was certainly
not apprehenſive of meeting any body like
her; and with a party he formed there, he
went in a few days to Ortney-bury, his ſeat
in Staffordſhire, where he tried to perſuade
himſelf that he hated and deſpiſed all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
women, and never would give himſelf
a moment's concern about one of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0206900202:243"/>
Very differently did Montague Thorold
ſuſtain the loſs of Celeſtina's company,
and the cruel probability, amounting almoſt
he believed to a certainty, that he ſhould
never ſee her again. While he remained
at his father's houſe, which was hardly a
week after her quitting it, he fed his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
love by collecting many little me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials
of her, which he preſerved as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
relics with all the fond idolatry of
romantic paſſion. A cambrick handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
which ſhe had dropped, marked by
her own hands and with her own hair,
was one of the principal of theſe, and in it
he conſtantly kept folded up the ſonnet,
written with a pencil, which he ſteeped in
milk to preſerve the letters from being
eraſed; a card on which ſhe had ſketched
a landſkape, and a profile which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to make of her one evening by
a ſhade, though his trembling hand and
want of ſkill had deprived it of much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance,
were added to the packet which
he thus wore in his boſom, and which he
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0206900202:244"/>
ſo delighted in contemplating, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
all other claims upon his time; and
regardleſs of what his family ſaid or thought,
paſſed whole days alone in the fields, or
when he was with them, was reſerved, ſilent,
and reſtleſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thorold ſaw all this with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
but ſtill flattered himſelf that abſence,
and returning again to his ſtudies and his
college friends, would inſenſibly wean him
from the indulgence of a fruitleſs paſſion;
and ſometimes he entertained a vague and
diſtant hope that if Willoughby reſigned all
pretenſions to the hand of Celeſtina, the
merit and attachment of Montague might
have a claim to her gratitude and her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But of this he gave not the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
hint to his ſon, and parted with him
without naming Celeſtina, or ſeeming to
notice the ſtate of his mind in regard to her.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina in the mean time was journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards Scotland with Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
and her two little boys. As Cathcart
had hired a chaiſe to carry them to Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0206900202:245"/>
where Elphinſtone was to meet
them, they travelled ſlowly; but as the
weather was delightful, and her companion
became every day more agreeable to her,
Celeſtina was in no haſte to reach the end
of her journey. Every thing in this part
of England was new to her; and ſince the
fatal hour of her ſeparation from Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſhe had never been ſo calm as ſhe now
felt herſelf, though far enough from being
happy. The oftener ſhe read over the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſhe had received from Willoughby,
which were her conſtant companions, the
more ſteadily ſhe reflected on his principles
and his character, more firmly ſhe became
perſuaded that whatever was the cauſe of
their ſeparation, it was not owing to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of another, to idle caprice, or to
any motive which ſhould make her bluſh
for his morals or his heart.</p>
            <p>In this reliance on the honour of the man
to whom her heart was fondly devoted, ſhe
found ſo much conſolation, that ſhe drove
from her as reſolutely as ſhe could all thoſe
ſuſpicions which had embittered her mind
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0206900202:246"/>
on the information Vavaſour had given her.
She thought it very poſſible that the Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norths
<hi>were</hi> gone abroad, becauſe Lord
Caſtlenorth was never well in England;
and his lady, of more conſequence among
the Engliſh in Italy than ſhe could be in
London or even at Caſtlenorth, was much
fonder of being looked up to there, than in
being loſt in the crowd of thoſe who were
of equal or ſuperior rank at home. Their
daughter too affected foreign manners and
foreign ſentiments; and with the figure
and countenance of a coarſe Engliſh fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
peaſant, aſſumed ſometimes the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
vivacity of the Neapolitan beauty,
and ſometimes the inſinuating languor of
the Venetian; and when in England, had
very frequently declared her diſlike of the
people and the country, and expreſſed her
wonder that thoſe who could converſe in
any other, ſhould uſe the harſh and vulgar
language of the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>That a family thus diſpoſed ſhould not
remain in their native country, and above
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0206900202:247"/>
all, after the mortification they muſt have
met with from Willoughby's rejection of
their alliance, was not extraordinary; but
Celeſtina endeavoured to perſuade herſelf,
that though they were on the Continent
it was with no intention of renewing their
negociation with him, to which their pride
would never ſuffer them to ſtoop; and that,
though he ſhould meet them there, it
would be on his part involuntary, and
only as the nephew of Lord Caſtlenorth,
by no means as the lover of his daughter.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all her arguments, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and all her dependance on Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's
love and conſtancy, ſhe was ſometimes
conſcious of returns of ſuſpicion and fear;
and unable wholly to ſtifle the pangs ſhe
then felt, ſhe endeavoured to think leſs of
herſelf and more of others; and above all,
to intereſt herſelf for Mrs. Elphinſtone,
who ſeemed every hour more worthy of her
regard.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of their converſation ſhe
found, that Mr. and Mrs. Elphinſtone,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0206900202:248"/>
reduced as they had lately been in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
had once been in a very different
ſituation of life; and ſhe could not reſiſt
the inclination ſhe felt to learn what reverſe
of fortune had thrown them into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed
condition which Jeſſy had deſcribed
to her, and which had made a deep and
painful impreſſion on the generous ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Celeſtina: but however her anxiety
was excited, ſhe had ſo much delicacy as
to avoid wounding her new friend by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: unlike that very common deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of people, who love to enquire into
the ſorrows and misfortunes of others, not
with any view to relieve or even to ſoothe
them, but merely to gratify an impertinent
curioſity, and to riſe higher in their own
idea by the compariſon, while they cry like
the Phariſee—"Lord I thank thee that I
am not as other men are, even as this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican."</p>
            <p>To an heart ſuch as heaven had beſtowed
on Celeſtina, there was ſomething in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
not only reſpectable but ſacred;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0206900202:249"/>
and ſhe behaved towards Mrs. Elphinſtone
with infinitely more attention than ſhe could
ever prevail upon herſelf to ſhew to Mrs.
Thorold, amid all her buſtle of affluence
and her claims upon the veneration of the
world from good dinners and rich connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elphinſtone, however, who was
aware that Celeſtina knew part of her hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
was very ſolicitous to relate to her the
whole of it; conſcious that in her opinion
ſhe ſhould loſe nothing, and that Celeſtina
had in ſome meaſure a right to enquire
into the life of a perſon to whom ſhe had
given her confidence, and who was a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate
for her friendſhip and her eſteem.
She waited therefore a fit opportunity the
ſecond day of their journey to drop ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of her family; and ſeeing that Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
wiſhed to know more, ſhe ſaid, ſmiling,—"It
is ſomething like the perſonages
with whom we are preſented in old ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
and who meet in foreſts and among
rocks and recount their adventures; but
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0206900202:250"/>
do you know, my dear Miſs De Mornay,
that I feel very much diſpoſed to enact
ſuch a perſonage, and though it is but a
painful ſubject, to relate to you my paſt
life?"</p>
            <p>"And do you know, dear Madam,"
replied Celeſtina, "that no wandering lady
in romance had ever more inclination to
loſe her own reflections in liſtening to the
hiſtory of ſome friend who has by chance
met her, loſt in the thorny labyrinth of
uneaſy thoughts, than I have to liſten to
you."</p>
            <p>"Well then," rejoined Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
"you ſhall hear all that has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
me, "even from my girliſh days."
Mine has been a life, not marked, I think,
with any thing very extraordinary but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable
ill fortune, which, though I could
not eſcape it, I truſt I have ſuſtained with
fortitude. But here," continued ſhe, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her children, here are my little ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters:
without them, without feeling
that they were a truſt committed to me by
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0206900202:251"/>
heaven, from my ſacred attention to which,
no perſonal ſufferings, no care for myſelf,
could exempt me even for a moment, I
am afraid that I ſhould have tired long ago
in the rude and various path I have trod.
But my exordium will be longer than my
hiſtory.</p>
            <p>"My family are of Scottiſh origin. My
father, one of it's younger branches, was
ſettled as a merchant in London, and was
engaged in the American trade, by which
he was making a reſpectable proviſion for
his family, of three daughters and three
ſons, of whom my dear Frank was the
youngeſt, when the courſe of his buſineſs
brought him acquainted with the family of
Mr. Elphinſtone, who had poſſeſſions in the
Weſt India iſlands.</p>
            <p>"The father of Mr. Elphinſtone inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
ſome of theſe from his family, but, of
a greater part, became poſſeſſed by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes
made of lands in the iſlands ceded
to England at the peace of 1762. They at
firſt promiſed to anſwer his moſt ſanguine
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0206900202:252"/>
expectations; and on the ſtrength of thoſe
promiſes he quitted the Weſt Indies, where
he had lived many years on his own eſtate,
and came to London, eſtabliſhing his
houſehold in a ſtile of expence more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his imaginary than his real fortune.
His family conſiſted of a wife, who had
never been in England before, and who
brought with her all the pride ſhe had
boundleſsly indulged in Antigua, five chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and as many negroes.</p>
            <p>"A few years convinced Mr. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
that he had reckoned ſomewhat too
faſt on his annual income; but he was not
diſpoſed to diminiſh the ſhewy and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
ſtyle in which he firſt ſet out; and had
he himſelf thought of it, the oppoſition he
was ſure to meet with from his wife and
children would have deterred him from
any attempt to put a ſcheme of oeconomy
in practice.</p>
            <p>"His daughters were moſt expenſively
educated, and ſtill more expenſively
dreſſed, their mother wiſely making a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0206900202:253"/>
point of their being always the beſt dreſſed
girls in the ſchool to which they were ſent,
though among their ſchoolfellows there
were many children of the nobility. The
two boys were placed at Weſtminſter
School, where the elder was ſoon diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
for having more money and leſs
underſtanding than any boy of his age,
and where the tyrannical diſpoſition which
he had been ſuffered to exerciſe over the
unfortunate black people among whom he
had paſſed his childhood, broke out in ſo
many inſtances, that he was as much hated
for his overbearing temper as deſpiſed and
laughed at for his ignorance and his vanity.</p>
            <p>"The youngeſt, who is now my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
was in every thing the reverſe of his
brother: open, good humoured, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigning;
too gay and careleſs to think,
too quick to learn, which, however para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical
it may ſound, is in many inſtances
true—the boy who knows he can learn in
half an hour a taſk which another cannot
conquer in a day, is very apt to let alone
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0206900202:254"/>
learning it till application becomes too
late. Alexander Elphinſtone however was
ſo much a favourite, that when he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to do his buſineſs ſomebody or other
was always willing to do it for him; and
when his father took him from ſchool to
place him at an academy where he was to
be qualified for a merchant, he was as
much regretted as his brother was deteſted,
who had now acquired in the ſchool the
name of 'Squire Squaſhy, which he never
afterwards loſt.</p>
            <p>"It was about the year 1770, that Mr.
Elphinſtone, the father, in ſeeking for a
counting houſe to place his youngeſt ſon,
was introduced to my father. The pomp
with which the old gentleman was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded,
the high ſtyle in which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
himſelf to talk, the detail of his
eſtates, (though ſome of them brought
him every year in debt,) his negroes, and
his ſugar works, dazzled my father's eyes,
who had been accuſtomed only to a plainer
ſtile of life, and leſs flattering views of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0206900202:255"/>
profit. He was pleaſed with the thoughts
of taking into his counting houſe the ſon
of a man ſo opulent; and when he ſaw
the young gentleman himſelf, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
prejudiced in his favour. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
was then a tall boy of ſixteen: his
dark complexion was enlivened by black
eyes full of ſpirit and vivacity; and his
countenance, if not handſome, was expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of an open and ingenuous mind. The
premium which my father aſked was agreed
to, and young Elphinſtone became one of
our family, which conſiſted of my father,
his ſecond wife, by whom he had no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
my two ſiſters, and myſelf; for of my
three brothers, one was placed at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
another was gone to the Eaſt Indies,
and the youngeſt, my dear Frank, was
then at ſchool.</p>
            <p>"My mother-in-law was one of thoſe
common characters which are ſo difficult to
deſcribe unleſs it be by negatives. She was
not ill natured; ſhe was not a woman of
underſtanding; ſhe was not handſome;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0206900202:256"/>
ſhe was not young; ſhe was not well born
or well educated: but my father, who had
married her to take care of his family, and
to put the three thouſand pounds ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
into his buſineſs, was well enough
contented to ſee that ſhe did not behave
ill to his children, that ſhe brought him no
more, and that ſhe had always a plain din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ready for him when he came from
'Change; was ſatisfied with going on a
Saturday to a country houſe at Clapton,
near Hackney, and receiving the viſits of
the wives and daughters of traders like
himſelf; and had been brought up with
no higher ideas of elegance than what were
anſwered by their ſociety, or fancied any
ſuperior entertainment was to be found
than what ſhe enjoyed in the front boxes at
a play twice a year, or in a Chriſtmas at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
at Hackney Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>"It is true that on theſe occaſions ſhe
loved to be fine, to wear rich ſilks and
good lace, to clean and exhibit her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
roſe-diamond ear rings, and to wear
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0206900202:257"/>
my father's picture by way of bracelet,
faſtened by garnets on her comfortable
round arm. But theſe were indulgences
about which he never contended; and was
rather pleaſed that Mrs. and the Miſs
Cathcarts began to be conſidered as people
of ſome conſequence in the circle in which
they moved, while he gradually obtained
in the city the name of a warm man.</p>
            <p>"I was not more than eleven years old
when Mr. Elphinſtone became a member
of our family. One of my ſiſters was four
years older, and the other a year younger;
but my eldeſt ſiſter, at about the age of
ſeventeen, was married to a young Weſt
Indian of whom my father had the care,
and went with him to ſettle in Barbadoes.
My ſiſter Emily and I grew up to conſider
Elphinſtone as our brother; but I ſoon
learned to think of him with particular par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
and to grieve at the frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
which my father had to complain
of him. He was wild, eccentric, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable:
ſometimes rode away to races
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0206900202:258"/>
when he ought to have been ſettling with
the grocers, (for my father was now deeply
engaged in the Weſt India trade,) and
ſometimes got into ſcrapes with his old
ſchoolfellows, and was found at the watch-houſe
inſtead of the counting houſe; or if
he attended thoſe ſolemn meetings at which
the price of freight or the quality of Oſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghs
was diſcuſſed, he turned the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
perſons of the old merchants and
grocers into ridicule; and while they
thought he was making calculations, was
frequently drawing caricatures of them in
all their majeſty of wig, upon the leaves
of his memorandum book. But with all
this, he was ſo capable of buſineſs, ſo
ready with his pen, and ſo perfectly maſter
of accounts, that my father often ſaid he
could do more buſineſs in an hour than he
himſelf could do in three; and that if once
he became ſteady, he would make a great
figure as a merchant.</p>
            <p>"His father, the elder Mr. Elphinſtone,
found it convenient, after his ſon had been
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0206900202:259"/>
with us a year or two, to cultivate very aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduouſly
an acquaintance with our family.
Mrs. Elphinſtone, who had reluctantly
conſented that her youngeſt ſon ſhould be
brought up a merchant, now condeſcended
to viſit us, and in her drawling way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
civility. The Miſs Elphinſtone's
were directed to forget the diſtance between
Cavendiſh-ſquare and Mincing lane, and
to viſit us often; while we were of courſe
mightily delighted to receive invitations to
their routs, and to be admitted to add to
the croud which four or five times in a
winter filled their rooms in Cavendiſh
ſquare.</p>
            <p>"Inſenſibly my good mother in law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a taſte for what was then called the
other end of the town; and no longer
contented with the gratifications of Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſher's
Hall, or the Crown and Anchor,
which had once been the utmoſt limits of
her ambition, ſhe learned to ſigh for the
Soho Aſſembly, for five and twenty tables,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0206900202:260"/>
and the company of "titled Dowagers
and Yellow Admirals."</p>
            <p>"If this unfortunate mania ſeized her,
it was not wonderful that it extended it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to us. Emily had a very fine voice,
and the Miſs Elphinſtones had concerts to
which ſhe was invited. We both had
learned among ourſelves to act parts of
plays; the Miſs Elphinſtones had at their
houſe at Ealing a private theatre, and we
were promoted to parts in their drama.
Looking upon us as inferior to them in
our perſons, in our education, in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and in our fortunes, no idea of rivalry
ever diſturbed this intercourſe, and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
we paſſed more time with them than
we did at home; whither I ſhould always
have returned with murmurs and regret, if
it had not been the only place where I
could meet young Elphinſtone without
witneſſes, the only place where ſome folly
of the moment did not ſeem to make him
forget the preference he profeſſed to give
me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0206900202:261"/>
"Such was the ſituation of the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
when the eldeſt ſon of the Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone's,
the gentleman who had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
at Weſtminſter by the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of 'Squire Squaſhy, arrived from a
twelvemonth's tour in France and Italy,
and with him a ſort of tutor who had been
ſent with him at a very exorbitant ſalary.
To all the native arrogance and invincible
ſtupidity of his original character, this
elder brother had added the pertneſs of
fancied knowledge and the conſciouſneſs
of travelled ſuperiority; a more diſguſting
character could hardly be imagined. He
was now not only above all the reſt of the
world, but infinitely above his own family:
his mother was ſilenced by—"Good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam!
how is it poſſible <hi>you</hi> ſhould know?"
his father, by a ſilent ſhrug of contempt
and a diſdain of argument; while his
ſiſters, who piqued themſelves upon their
elegance and faſhion, were ridiculed for
being <hi>ſi bourgoiſe,</hi> that they were hardly
within the poſſibility of being made <hi>comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0206900202:262"/>
faut.</hi> As to my ſiſter and myſelf, who
were with them when he arrived, he
looked at us once through his opera glaſs,
enquired who we were, and hearing we
were the daughters of his father's merchant
and lived in the city, he never, on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
that I can recollect, deigned to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
us again. Unhappily, the gentleman
who had travelled and who ſtill continued
with him, ſaw with different eyes my poor
little Emily, then not quite fifteen: he
affected to be highly pleaſed with her ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and undertook to give her inſtructions.
He would teach us both French, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
our acting. We were invited to
paſs two months at Ealing, at a houſe
which Mr. Elphinſtone rented, and to
which his daughters had given the name
of Cypreſs Grove, though not a cypreſs
higher than a gooſeberry-buſh was near it;
and there we were to act plays: in which,
though the elder hope of the family de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
taking a part and abſented himſelf
from the ſet entirely, his travelling friend,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0206900202:263"/>
whoſe name was Beresford, was of great
conſequence; and Alexander Elphinſtone
was permitted by my father to quit, on
thoſe occaſions, the high counting ſtool
and ſharp deſk for the throne of King
Pyrrhus, or the triumphal car of his name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
Alexander.</p>
            <p>"I will own, that young as I then was,
being not quite ſixteen, my childiſh heart
was enchanted with theſe amuſements, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
when <hi>he</hi> bore a part in them to
whom that heart was already ſo fondly
attached. Unſuſpecting and artleſs, I
dreamed not of the miſchief which lurked
under all this feſtive pleaſure; and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of thinking for myſelf, I was a very
inſufficient guard to my ſiſter, who was
ſtill younger and more thoughtleſs; yet to
me was ſhe entruſted; unleſs, which did
not very often happen, my mother left
the card table to be a ſpectator of the
amuſements of the younger part of the
company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0206900202:264"/>
"Emily, however, was always with me;
but it is true that young Elphinſtone was
always with me too, and in liſtening to
him, I heard not or attended not to the
more dangerous converſation with which
Mr. Beresford entertained my ſiſter. He
contrived moſt artfully to put her upon her
guard againſt all confidence, which he
knew muſt ruin his ſcheme; and the firſt
idea I had of my poor Emily's misfortune,
was, when on awaking one morning I
found ſhe was already riſen, contrary to
her uſual cuſtom. I was not, however,
alarmed, till, on beginning to dreſs myſelf,
I found the drawers where we kept our
cloaths were emptied of every thing of
her's: even then I had only a confuſed idea
of what had happened, 'till, in looking
wildly round the room, I ſaw a note upon
the table, which I opened in trembling
aſtoniſhment, and read thus:</p>

            <p>"My ideas were at once ſo painful and
ſo confuſed, that I loſt all recollection for
a moment, and running down ſtairs half
dreſſed as I was, I aſked in breathleſs agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for my ſiſter—my ſiſter Emily! The
ſervants who were up, (for it was yet early
morning,) ſtared at me without compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
my diſtreſs; and I found nobody
diſpoſed to attend to me till the younger
Elphinſtone met me and eagerly enquired
what was the matter. I put the note I held
into his hand, ſat down in the ſeat of a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0206900202:266"/>
window, and burſt into tears. He ſaw in
a moment what my ignorance of the world
had in ſome meaſure concealed from me;
and knowing that Beresford was the laſt
man in the world likely to marry, he knew
that Emily was loſt. Neither my father or
his wife were then at Ealing; and he
pauſed a moment on what could be done.</p>
            <p>"He then endeavoured to conſole and
reaſſure me, and went to his father and his
mother to inform them of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.
The old gentleman came to me in
a few moments, adviſed me to go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
home and acquaint my parents, and
ſent a ſervant for a poſt chaiſe, in which
he ſaid his younger ſon ſhould attend me.
I hardly know how I left the houſe; but
I remember Mrs. Elphinſtone did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and that the young ladies expreſſed
none of that concern which I thought I
ſhould have felt for the reſt, had any one
of them diſappeared under circumſtances
ſo prejudicial to their fame."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0206900202:267"/>
The travellers now arrived at Stilton,
where they were to reſt that night. It was
late, and Mrs. Elphinſtone appearing a
good deal fatigued, Celeſtina beſought her
to delay any farther gratification of her
curioſity till the next day. She then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
her friend in giving her children their
ſupper and putting them to bed; and after
a ſhort repaſt together, they retired to reſt
in two beds in the ſame room, where the
children were already aſleep.</p>

            <p>THE following day they proceeded
early on their journey, and Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
thus reaſſumed her narrative.—"In
our way from Ealing to London, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Elphinſtone endeavoured by every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in his power to ſtrengthen my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and calm thoſe fears I expreſſed
at meeting with my father and mother; who
would, I apprehended, be enraged againſt
me for a misfortune they had themſelves
taken no pains to prevent. This dreadful
meeting muſt however be hazarded: I
tottered as well as I was able into the dining-room,
and ſending for my father out of
his counting-houſe, I put into his hands
the fatal note, and informed him as well
as I could of what had happened. He
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0206900202:269"/>
was too reaſonable to blame me for an
error he had as little foreſeen himſelf; but
haſtening out of the room with Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
enquired, as I afterwards learned,
whether he thought Beresford meant to
marry my ſiſter? Elphinſtone, with ſome
heſitation, anſwered that he feared not. "Let
us then," ſaid he, "endeavour to find
her, and if it be poſſible, huſh up this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
affair before it becomes more known."</p>
            <p>"Elphinſtone moſt willingly agreed to
aſſiſt him in the ſearch, and my elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was ſent for from the Temple for the
ſame purpoſe. <hi>His</hi> anger and indignation
were much more turbulent than my father's.
He vowed vengeance againſt Beresford,
and ſat out in purſuit of him in ſuch a
temper of mind as made me dread the
conſequence ſhould he find him.</p>
            <p>"To find him, however, every effort
proved abortive. Among other places, my
Mr. Elphinſtone went to enquire for him
at the lodgings his elder brother had taken
in Piccadilly. The 'Squire received him
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0206900202:270"/>
with that contemptuous coldneſs which he
thought was all he owed to a merchant's
clerk; and upon his eager enquiry after
Berresford, and learning the reaſon of it,
he ſaid—"What a fuſs is here, indeed,
about a little griſette: why, one would
think Beresford had carried off an
heireſs. Let him alone, and I dare ſay
he will bring her back again." His bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
enraged at this inſult, ſpoke to him
very freely, which he returned no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than by calling him quill-driver, and
maccaroni of Mincing-lane. The brothers
parted in wrath; and the younger returned
home lamenting his fruitleſs ſearch, and
deviſing new meaſures for the next day.
Theſe, however, were equally ſucceſsleſs.
Poor Emily was loſt to us for ever; and
the feeble hope that Beresford might have
married her every day became fainter.</p>
            <p>"This unhappy affair put an end to our
intercourſe with the Elphinſtone family,
and was indeed the firſt ſignal of a long
long ſeries of calamities. I obſerved that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0206900202:271"/>
my father grew extremely uneaſy at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that related to the ſituation of his
affairs: he began to complain that Mr.
Elphinſtone's remittances fell very ſhort of
what he expected; that he was paid no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
for the large ſums he had advanced
for him; and while he was deliberating
how to get out of the difficulties theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
threw him into, he received
information, that Mr. Elphinſtone, deeply
involved before, had been overwhelmed
by the expences of his eldeſt ſon, and the
failure of his remittances, had gone off in
the night from his houſe at Ealing to Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
whence he had embarked in the
packet for Antigua; while his lady and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
had ſhut up their houſes at Ealing
and in Cavendiſh-ſquare, and were gone
to Bath.</p>
            <p>"Theſe terrible tidings fell on my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like a ſtroke of thunder, and for ſome
time he was unable to attempt applying
any remedy to the evils he ſaw gathering
around him. But from the torpor of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0206900202:272"/>
anguiſh, he was rouſed by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
demands of thoſe, of whom he had on
his own ſecurity borrowed money for the
ſupply of Mr. Elphinſtone. It was at a
ſeaſon when many months were to intervene
before he could receive any remittances from
his correſpondent, even if his correſpondent
ſhould have honour enough to ſend them,
and bankruptcy and ruin ſeemed inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
He had however, as he thought, a
friend in a very eminent banker, who a
few months before, on his engaging ſo
largely with Mr. Elphinſtone, had heard
ſome report that that gentleman, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
him in favour of the banker with
whom <hi>he</hi> was connected; on which my
father's friend, a man of immenſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
had then written to him thus—</p>

compleatly opened, and all the horrors of
his fate were before him. Young Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
ſtill ſanguine as to his father's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
and his father's honour, was on this
occaſion his great reſource. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
in ſtemming the torrent of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
thus brought upon us; and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0206900202:276"/>
ſo well by various expedients, as
to ſupport for a while the ſinking credit of
the houſe; but ſeeing my father become
every day more and more anxious, and
doubtful about the elder Mr. Elphinſtone,
he propoſed to go over to Antigua himſelf;
and to this propoſal added, that of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me and taking me with him. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who found his health giving way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the accumulated calamities that had
lately befallen him, now thought it better
to accept this propoſal, and by a union of
families make it Mr. Elphinſtone's intereſt
to be juſt. We were married then, after
a reluctant conſent wrung from the haughty
mother of my lover, and three weeks after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
embarked for the Weſt Indies.</p>
            <p>"I was not yet old enough to conſider the
ſituation of our fortune with any great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern:
but I parted from my own father
with a ſad preſentiment that we were to
meet no more, and I dreaded my intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to the father of my huſband. But
I loved <hi>him;</hi> he was the moſt cheerful and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0206900202:277"/>
ſanguine creature in the world; and painted
to me only ſcenes of proſperity and
happineſs, which I was well pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
as true repreſentations. Gracious
heaven! could I <hi>then</hi> have foreſeen all
the miſery that was in ſtore for me, how
ſhould I have ſhrunk from a deſtiny ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable!
how ſhould I have wiſhed
that in a violent ſtorm we met in the Bay
of Biſcay, we might periſh.</p>
            <p>"We arrived, however, after a tedious
paſſage, at Antigua; and I was relieved
from the diſcomforts of a long voyage, to
encounter, as I believed, what I dreaded
more—the diſdain and rudeneſs of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in law. I landed, trembling with this
apprehenſion, diſguſted with every thing I
ſaw, and overcome with heat and ſickneſs:
but the firſt intelligence we heard was,
that Mr. Elphinſtone had been dead about
a week of an epidemical diſtemper, and
that his houſes and plantations were in the
poſſeſſion of the agents of his eldeſt ſon.</p>
            <p>"It was in vain that my huſband deſired
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0206900202:278"/>
to be admitted to reſide on one of them
till he could ſee into his father's affairs: the
people who had been placed there refuſed
him any ſatisfaction; and it was only by
applying to the Governor that he at length
obtained a ſight of the will, by which he
found that his father had left every thing to
his elder brother, and an annuity to his
mother of eight hundred a year, with five
thouſand pounds, to each of his daughters
and to his youngeſt ſon: but as the eſtates
were not charged with theſe laſt legacies,
nor able to pay them if it had, his nominal
fortune gave him but little comfort, nor
alleviated the concern with which he ſaw
too evidently that all the ſums of money
lent by <hi>my</hi> father to <hi>his,</hi> were entirely
loſt.</p>
            <p>"The pain this gave him, the inceſſant
fatigue to which he expoſed himſelf in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Granada and St. Vincents, where
his father had made purchaſes, at length
overcame the natural ſtrength of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
After we had been about four
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0206900202:279"/>
months in the Weſt Indies, living with
his friends, he was ſeized at Granada with
one of thoſe ſevers ſo common in that cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.
An old French lady, who lived on
her own eſtate near the lonely habitation
where he was taken ill, had pity upon him,
took him to her houſe, and by her extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
care carried him through the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
but he was very long in a ſtate of infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
weakneſs, and could articulate nothing
but a requeſt that he might ſee his wife.
It was ſome time before I received intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of his ſituation, and ſome time lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
before I could get to him. The kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our foreign friend did not ſtop
there: I was now in a ſtate which excited
her generous compaſſion towards me, and
ſhe inſiſted, that inſtead of returning to
Europe in a ſituation ſo unfit for a voyage,
I ſhould ſtay with her, till the birth of my
child.</p>
            <p>"Poor Elphinſtone's weak condition of
health indeed, rendered ſuch a voyage as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
for him as for me. We accepted
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0206900202:280"/>
therefore the generous hoſpitality of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Du Moulinet, and at her houſe in
Granada my eldeſt child was born.</p>
            <p>"During the five months we remained
there, we heard that the elder brother
was come over himſelf to Antigua and had
taken poſſeſſion of every thing. We had
therefore no buſineſs to go back, where
we had no authority nor indeed any provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but as ſoon as our hoſteſs would
give us leave, embarked again, to return
to England more deſtitute than we had left
it, and with a little unfortunate baby to
ſhare our diſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>"We arrived there, after an abſence of
thirteen months; and haſtened to London
as cheaply as we could, for we had very little
money. My poor Elphinſtone left me at
the inn where we ſtopped, and went to
my father's houſe. Never ſhall I forget the
look with which he returned to me: his
bloodleſs cheeks, his wild eyes, his trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
lips, ſpoke before he could utter a
ſyllable. He ſat down; looked earneſtly
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0206900202:281"/>
on me a moment, then on his child, which
was ſleeping in my arms, ſtarted up, ran
from us, ſtaggered towards the wainſcot,
and fell.</p>
            <p>"My ſcrearns brought the people of the
inn into our miſerable room. They took
up the unhappy young man, and gave him
what aſſiſtance they could, ſuppoſing that
he had fallen into a fit. After a moment,
he recovered his ſpeech, and entreating to
be left alone with me, told me that my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was dead inſolvent, all his effects
ſold, and my mother in law gone to reſide
with her relations in the North: "and 'tis I
have undone thee, my Sophy," cried he—tis
I and my family who have reduced
thee to beggary, and now I have not a
place wherein to ſhelter thee and this dear
hapleſs innocent."</p>
            <p>"Agony now choaked his utterance; and
all my reſolution was neceſſary to prevent
his relapſing into the ſtate he had juſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from. Stiſling therefore my own an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
I beſought him to take courage; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0206900202:282"/>
that I feared nothing while he was
with me and well, and urged him to think of
ſome place where we might paſs the night
and recover courage to encounter what was
before us.</p>
            <p>"He ſeemed comforted by my calmneſs,
and recollected an old ſervant of his father's
who kept a lodging houſe in Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland-ſtreet.
Thither we determined to
go; the man was gone from thence, but
ſome other people who let lodgings now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
the houſe: they had a bed cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
on the ſecond floor to let; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſomething of us, took us in.</p>
            <p>"Fatigue of body overcame for a ſhort
time the agony of mind my poor huſband
had felt. He was aſleep by me; my infant
was at my breaſt; but <hi>I</hi> could not ſleep;
all the horrors of poverty were before me,
and my agitated ſpirit ran over every hope
which yet remained for us, but reſted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
on none.</p>
            <p>"The morning at laſt came; and I now
deſired Elphinſtone to enquire out my el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0206900202:283"/>
brother, who when we went away had
chambers in the Temple; and to diſcover
what was become of my dear Frank, whom
we had left at ſchool, and to whom I was
always fondly attached. Poor Emily too
recurred to me, but for her, alas! I
dared not enquire.</p>
            <p>"He went out, therefore, after break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
and returned in about an hour with
looks that gave me no favourable impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his ſucceſs. My eldeſt brother, he
told me, had left his chambers, and had
been married ſome months to a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of ſome fortune, at leaſt in expectancy,
being the only child of her parents, with
whom they lived; and that her father, an
attorney of practice in Warwick-court Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
had taken my brother into his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
"I ſaw him however," ſaid Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone;
"but he received me ſo coldly
that I ſhall hardly repeat the viſit."</p>
            <p>"My heart ſunk cold within me, and
I had hardly courage to aſk what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of Frank.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0206900202:284"/>
"He is at I know not what academy,
replied Elphinſtone. "Your brother John
told me, very coolly, that though he was
ſo lucky as to have a proviſion by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
himſelf, it was out of his power to
provide for all his father's family; and
thought it quite enough, that he had been
at ſo much expence for Frank, who muſt
now," ſaid he, "do ſomething for himſelf,
for I cannot undertake to pay his ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another year: and you, Sir, as it is
owing to your family that my father was
ruined, I hope you will now take this
burthen off my hands; for my wife's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
are very much diſcontented at my
bearing it."</p>
            <p>"Gracious God!" cried I, "what will
become of us! Oh, my poor baby! why
wert thou ever born!"</p>
            <p>"To embitter our calamities," cried El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone.
"Rather aſk, my Sophy, why
<hi>I</hi> was ever born, who brought them upon
thee, and on that dear little victim."</p>
            <p>"We had ſo little money left, that it
was neceſſary to think of ſomething di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly:
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0206900202:285"/>
Elphinſtone therefore went out
again to enquire after his mother and his
ſiſters, from ſome of thoſe families who
had, during their ſplendour, been the
fondeſt of their ſociety and the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
at their houſe. Among theſe was
one lady who had always profeſſed the
greateſt affection in the world for them
all; never ſpoke to Mrs. Elphinſtone
but as her dear friend, nor to her
children under any other appellation
than her ſweet creatures, or her amiable
young friends. Elphinſtone gave me, as
nearly as he could, the words in which ſhe
anſwered his enquiry.</p>
            <p>"Why, my dear, dear Sir, you muſt
think how ſhocked and amazed I was—your
poor good mother!—to be ſure I
had a moſt ſincere regard for her—and
your ſiſters too; good ſweet young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men—ſo
amiable, ſo accompliſhed!—I'm
amazed they never married.—Well,
poor things—God knows, to be ſure,
what is beſt for us:—Whatever is, is
right, as Pope obſerves."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0206900202:286"/>
"But, dear Madam, I muſt beg to learn
where my mother and my ſiſters are?—I
am but juſt come from the ſhip that
brought me back to England."</p>
            <p>"Is it poſſible!—Poor young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man!—I'm
ſure I wiſh I could inform
you of any thing agreeable. You don't
know, then, perhaps, that every thing in
Cavendiſh-ſquare, and at Ealing, was
ſold under executions, as I heard; but I
heartily hope it was not ſo. Such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable
family! and ſo many fine young
people! and your poor good mother!—I
ſaw her at Bath laſt winter, after thoſe
diſagreeable affairs, and was ſorry to ſee
that ſhe had loſt a great deal of her
cheerfulneſs. To be ſure that was not to
be wondered at. I told her how ſincerely
I wiſhed her a pleaſant voyage, poor
worthy woman!" After being compelled
to liſten to a great deal more of this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
cant, he at length learned that one of
his ſiſters boarded with an apothecary's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
at Bath, being in an ill ſtate of health;
and that his mother, and the other two
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0206900202:287"/>
ſiſters, finding Mr. Elphinſtone, who was
diſtinguiſhed as 'Squire Squaſhy, little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to do them juſtice, had, by advice of
their friends, embarked for Antigua; ſo
that we probably paſſed them at ſea.</p>
            <p>"This was terrible! Every reſource
ſeemed to fail us, and in a few days fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
was likely to ſtare us in the face.
My beloved brother Frank, however, was,
among all my own diſtreſſes, ever near my
heart; and I determined for his ſake, and
becauſe I would leave nothing unattempted
for Elphinſtone and my child, to go myſelf
to my eldeſt brother, to implore the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of one, and obtain a ſight of the other.
I ſaid nothing, however, to Elphinſtone
of this intention, fearing he might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it. I ſet forth alone, with my baby
in my arms, for I could not leave it,
nor could I afford to hire a coach. I rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
at the door; and enquiring for Mr.
Cathcart, was told by the footman who
opened it, that I might wait in the paſſage,
and he would ſee. In the paſſage I waited
ſome minutes, and was then told that Mr.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0206900202:288"/>
Cathcart was buſy with ſome gentlemen,
and that I muſt ſend in my buſineſs and
call again.</p>
            <p>"Ah! Miſs De Mornay, you have no
relations, I think; nor can ever, nor will
ever, I hope, "feel how ſharper than a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's
tooth it is" to meet cruelty and
ſcorn from thoſe to whom the ſick heart
looks for pity and protection.</p>
            <p>"I was unwilling to ſend in my name
and a verbal meſſage, as there were people
with him; I therefore ſat down on a bench
where porters and ſervants ſit in thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
and wrote with a pencil—"It is
your ſiſter Sophy, who cannot call again."
This brought out the great man, for great
he ſuddenly was become. His likeneſs to
my father, the tender recollection that he
was my brother, made me forget all his
unkindneſs the moment I ſaw him, and
I was throwing myſelf and my child into
his arms, when a cold—how d'ye do Mrs.
Elphinſtone? fixed me to the place. I
ſuppoſe he thought by my looks that I
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0206900202:289"/>
ſhould faint, and was afraid of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to his ſervants and new relations,
for he took my hand, faintly kiſſed my
cheek, and leading me into a little dark
parlour where there was no fire, and deſired
me to ſit down.</p>
            <p>"Some remains of natural affection,
which, in a young man, is very rarely
totally extinguiſhed, ſeemed to be contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with pride, avarice, and mean policy,
and for a while kept him ſilent: he then
enquired coldly into our ſituation, and as
I related it, (for he had no idea it was ſo
bad,) I ſaw thoſe affections gradually ſhrink
from the detail: his heart ſeemed to become
harder as it's tenderneſs became more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
and he declared to me at laſt,
that I had formed erroneous ideas of his
ſituation if I thought it was in his power
to be of any ſervice to me. I roſe to go;
but deſired a direction to Frank, which he
gave me very unwillingly; for ſince I
could contribute nothing to his ſupport,
he thought it uſeleſs for me to ſee him.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0206900202:290"/>
I do not now very well know how I got out
of the houſe of this cruel brother, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
introduced me to his family, or ſeemed
to wiſh to ſee me again: but I recollect
that when I came into Holborn I became
ſo very faint and ſick, that I was obliged
to get into a coach to return home, which
I paid for by changing the laſt guinea I had
in the world.</p>
            <p>"Ah! my dear Miſs De Mornay!
veteran in ſorrow as I have ſince been, I
look back with wonder on the ſcene I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
paſſed through; I wonder how
I ſupported it. We lingered on for three
months at theſe lodgings; my beloved
Frank often, and always happy to be with
us. He was now near ſixteen; very tall and
very manly, and repeatedly declared to
Elphinſtone that he was well able to get
his bread, or to aſſiſt him in any way of
buſineſs he could enter into. Buſineſs
however was not to be obtained without
money; but my father's creditors knowing
how well Elphinſtone was acquainted with
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0206900202:291"/>
his affairs, engaged him to aſſiſt them in
recovering debts due to him, and allowed
him from time to time ſome very trifling
compenſation, which was our only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>As long, however, as he was well—as
long as my little boy bleſt me by it's
innocent ſmiles, I murmured at nothing;
and the little time I could ſpare from nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, and after he was in his cradle of
a night, I found exquiſite pleaſure in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
thoſe little arts I had learned as
matters of amuſement, to the purpoſes of
profit. They produced not much; but in
our ſituation every thing was an help; and
our ſimple meal, partly the produce of my
induſtry, and ſhared with my brother
Frank, after Elphinſtone came home of a
night, was infinitely a ſweeter banquet
than the inſipid though ſplendid tables of
the affluent had formerly afforded me. At
length, however, the perſecution of ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
which ſeemed to have relaxed a
little, began anew, and miſery fell upon me
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0206900202:292"/>
where I could leaſt bear it. Elphinſtone
was ſeized again with an infectious fever,
differing only from that he had at Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,
in the ſymptoms occaſioned by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of climate. On his attendance on
the creditors, our daily and ſcanty ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
depended: with his confinement,
every aid of that ſort ceaſed; and I ſaw
him languiſhing in a ſick bed, in all the
depreſſion of a malignant fever, without the
means of giving him the neceſſary aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>"A neighbouring apothecary, however,
attended him, who told me that wine was
abſolutely neceſſary to be given him in
large quantities. Where was I to get it?—For
the firſt time, I had recourſe to a
pawnbroker, and my dear, dear Frank was
my agent: for now, attached entirely to
us, he quitted his ſchool, where, indeed,
he knew more than the maſter, and gave
himſelf up wholly to our ſervice: while
my brother John, not ſorry to be relieved
from the expence of ſupporting him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0206900202:293"/>
or rather quarrelled with him
once, and, obtaining an excuſe for ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him off, ſaw him no more.</p>
            <p>"I had a watch, and a few trinkets;
theſe were firſt diſpoſed off, and then ſuch
clothes as I could ſpare; for I could not
endure the thoughts of taking any thing that
belonged to Elphinſtone, though my trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
heart too often whiſpered that he
would want them no more. Youth, and
the ſtrength of his conſtitution, carried him
on many days through a rapid and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
fatal diſtemper; and, at length, my
fainting courage was ſuſtained by the hope
of his recovery, when my lovely infant
was ſeized with the ſame terrible diſorder;
and I was told, that as it was almoſt
always fatal to children, I muſt not hope.</p>
            <p>"I know not, then, what became of
me; but I think, that for ſome hours I was
not in my ſenſes. I recollect being ſeized
with an earneſt wiſh to have my child
attended by a phyſician I had heard named,
as eminent for his humanity as for his
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0206900202:294"/>
peculiar ſkill in this diſorder; and, as Frank
was not at that moment with us, I wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
myſelf in an old cloak, and leaving
my poor infant to the care of his father,
who was juſt able to ſit by the cradle and
look at him with eyes of hopeleſs agony, I
went away myſelf to implore this phyſician
to come to us; and had juſt ſenſe enough
to remember the direction I had received
to his houſe, but none to notice the objects
around me, or to care what people might
think, who ſaw me, with wild looks and
uncertain ſteps, hurrying through the crowd
of the buſy and the happy.</p>
            <p>"I had proceeded as far as the corner
of Cecil-ſtreet, when a croud of carriages
and paſſengers impeded the croſſing; I
was making my way through them, heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of the danger, and hardly hearing the
noiſe, when a footman, in a livery glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with lace, ſtopped me, and told me he
was ordered by his lady to beg I would
ſtep to the door of her carriage and ſpeak
to her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0206900202:295"/>
"Oh! I cannot; I cannot, indeed," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
I, without enquiring who his lady
was: "my child—my child is ill—I am
"going for advice for him." I would have
paſſed the man; but he followed me, and
pointed to an elegant vis-a-vis that was
drawn up cloſe to the broad pavement.
"Here is my lady, Ma'am," ſaid the man.</p>
            <p>"I looked up:—it was my Emily, my
long loſt, lamented Emily! I gave a faint
ſhriek, and hardly heard her in a low and
tremulous voice articulate—"My ſiſter!
"my ſiſter Sophy!"</p>
            <p>"Not quite in my ſenſes when I left
my lodgings, this interview quite robbed
me of them. I caught hold of the door of
the carriage, or I ſhould have fallen in the
ſtreet. Every object ſwam before me; and
I retained only recollection enough to cry,
"My child! my child! ſave my child!"
and to hear Emily repeat—"What child?
"what can I do for you? Good Heaven!
what can I do for you?" But I was unable
to anſwer. I found myſelf, however, in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0206900202:296"/>
a few moments, placed in the carriage, and
Emily holding her ſalts to my noſe, and
chafing my temples. When my ſenſes
returned, my child was their firſt object;
and again I exclaimed—"Oh! do not, do
not detain me; I muſt go to ſave my
child—my poor little boy!"</p>
            <p>"My dear, dear ſiſter," cried Emily,
pray ſummons your recollection, and tell
me whither you would go; we will drive
"to the place directly." In my anxiety
for the life of my infant; I forgot the
culpable conduct of my ſiſter; and, telling
her where the phyſician lived, ſhe gave
orders to her coachman to haſten thither
inſtantly. A ſtrange ſtupor overwhelmed
me; I could not ſpeak till we came to the
door of the houſe: I then looked out;
I would have flown out of the carriage.
He was not at home: but juſt as we were
leaving the door, he drew up to it.</p>
            <p>"Then my voice and recollection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to me. I beſought him moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to go with me. He was that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0206900202:297"/>
come from his firſt round of viſits to
change his horſes, and begged we would
wait a few moments: but Emily urged
him ſo earneſtly to get into her carriage,
ſaying ſhe would take him to my lodgings
and bring him back, that he could not
reſiſt her importunity. He went with us
then; and ſo totally was my mind abſorbed
in the danger of my child, that I heeded
not the ſtrange contraſt between my appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and the gay ſplendour of my ſiſter; I
forgot what ſhe was, and almoſt who ſhe
was; and only enquired, when the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
had ſeen my child, whether he
would live.</p>
            <p>"I ſaw by his looks his opinion to the
contrary; nor, indeed, did he attempt to
conceal it: but he beſought me to attend
to my own health, and to that of my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
gave directions about us all, and
departed with my ſiſter, refuſing the fee I
offered him, and telling me he would
come again early the next day.</p>
            <p>"Elphinſtone, amazed as he was at
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0206900202:298"/>
the ſcene that had paſſed, had no power to
enquire the meaning of it, and I had none
to explain it: all my reſolution was rouſed
to attend my dying infant; but all could
not ſave him—he died: and I now tell it
with dry eyes, though, when it beſel me, I
thought no blow could be ſo ſevere, and
that I could not ſurvive it:
<q>
                  <l>For ſince the birth of Cain, the firſt male child,</l>
                  <l>To him that did but yeſterday ſuſpire</l>
                  <l>Never was ſuch a gracious creature born!</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>"Yet I have lived now above ten years
longer, my dear Miſs De Mornay; and
have learned that there are ſuch evils in
life as make an early death a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>"I was delirious, I know not how long,
between the exceſs of my affliction and the
opiates that were given me to deliver me
awhile from the ſenſe of my miſery. In
the mean time my ſiſter ſent a careful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to attend me, and ſaw me every day
herſelf, though I no longer knew her, or
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0206900202:299"/>
any body but Elphinſtone, whoſe hand I
held for hours, imploring him not to let
them take my child from me. Emily did
yet more: ſhe ſupplied us with every thing
we wanted, attended herſelf to the funeral
of my poor baby, and then took lodgings
for us at Kenſington, that we might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the place where we had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
ſo much calamity. In her frequent
viſits ſhe ſpoke not either to Elphinſtone
or Frank, unleſs they firſt ſpoke to her;
and never but on the ſubjects of my health
and eaſe. I was not yet quite reſtored to
my ſenſes when we removed. She ſent us,
by a porter, the next day, a forty pound
note, with theſe words:</p>

            <p>"As ſoon as I was capable of reading
and underſtanding this, all that had paſſed
came back to my recollection. I had been
ſupported, then, for many days, by the
wages of ſhame; and now had nothing
but a gift from the ſame hand, to ſave my
huſband, my brother, and myſelf, from
actual hunger. "Oh! my dear father,"
cried I, "can you forgive your unfortunate
child; or rather, your unfortunate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren!
and ought I to refuſe taking this
lovely loſt one, whoſe heart, ſo generous,
ſo full of ſenſibility, cannot ſurely be
quite hardened in a courſe of evil!"—I
ſhall tire you, my dear Madam, if I am ſo
minute: ſuffice it to ſay, that I ſaw my
ſiſter; that ſhe owned all her guilt, and all
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0206900202:301"/>
her folly; without having the power, or, at
that time, perhaps, the wiſh, to quit a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life, where ſhe poſſeſſed boundleſs
ſplendour and luxury, for ſuch a preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſubſiſtence as women can earn in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
My remonſtrances ſhe heard with
gentleneſs, and mingled her tears with
mine: but ſhe pleaded gratitude to the
friend who ſupported her, and the impoſſibility
of her abandoning him, or exiſting if
ſhe did. I was afraid of enquiring who
this was; but I found that it was ſome
man of high rank who had taken her from
the worthleſs Beresford, and with whom
ſhe had lived ever ſince.</p>
            <p>"Her purpoſe ſeemed to be to detach
my thoughts as much as poſſible from her
ſituation, and to fix them on my own: and
indeed it was very neceſſary; for we had
now, in conſequence of Elphinſtone's long
illneſs, no ſupport whatever but what her
tenderneſs afforded us.</p>
            <p>"As Elphinſtone recovered his health,
his ſanguine temper returned, and again
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0206900202:302"/>
he formed various projects of entering into
buſineſs. It was now the midſt of the
American troubles; and ſome part of my
father's property, which was thought reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable,
was there. Elphinſtone, who now
from long habit and from his natural diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
was become unſettled and fond of
ſpeculative ſchemes, propoſed to the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to go over there in ſearch of theſe ſums.
I was ſtill too ill and too much depreſſed by
paſt ſufferings to give very minute atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this plan: I only reſolved not to be
left behind, but to ſhare his deſtiny what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it might be. In a fortnight or three
weeks he was every day in town, and the
latter part of that time returned in remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
gay ſpirits, and told me of I know
not what proſpects that were opening to
him; to which, indifferent to every thing
beyond a mere ſubſiſtence, now that I had
loſt my boy, and long accuſtomed to hear
of viſionary fortune, I gave very little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
till he came home one day elated
beyond what I had ever ſeen before, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0206900202:303"/>
told me that an offer had that day been
made him to become a ſort of under ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to a man high in adminiſtration, into
whoſe houſe he was to be taken; that he
was to enter on his place the following
week, had taken a lodging for me in the
neighbourhood, and hired two female ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and a footman to attend.</p>
            <p>"I wondered at, and rather blamed his
precipitancy; but he aſſured me he was
right. Frank went with us, as he was to
be a ſort of ſecretary, in his turn, to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone,
who was now domeſticated with
his patron, while my brother and I were in
very handſome lodgings in Weſtminſter.
I do not know by what means the money
came, but from this time it was as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with Elphinſtone as it had before been
ſcarce. In a few months his views were ſo
much enlarged that he took a houſe for me,
increaſed the number of his ſervants, and
from one thing to another our eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was at length on a footing of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
againſt which I remonſtrated in vain.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0206900202:304"/>
He aſſured me that his future ſucceſs
depended on his keeping up ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
that the emoluments of his
place fully entitled him to it; and that
I ſhould ſoon ſee him permanently fixed
in a ſituation, ſuch as would put us out
of the power of fortune.</p>
            <p>"In the mean time, as I never loved
London, and as my health was very much
hurt by a long continuance in it, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
on him to let me have a ſmall houſe
at Shene, near Richmond, where it would
not be neceſſary, for me at leaſt, to be
always in company, which began to be
unavoidable in London. To this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
he conſented at firſt with reluctance;
but afterwards, I thought he was not ſorry
to have his houſe in town at liberty to
receive the parties he now made there, by
which it became diſtinguiſhed for good
cheer and high living. I had by this
time two boys; one of whom I have ſince
loſt, and the other is the eldeſt of theſe:
and with many a ſilent and ſtiſled ſigh I
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0206900202:305"/>
wiſhed their father would think, while
in this proſperous train of fortune, of
making ſome proviſion for his increaſing
family.</p>
            <p>"He heard me always with his uſual
good temper, and as conſtantly aſſured me
that he was laying by money every year;
though I never could gueſs how or from
whence it came.</p>
            <p>"Frank, however, was not only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
like a gentleman, but had really
more money than, had he been leſs pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and ſteady, would have been proper
for ſo young a man.</p>
            <p>"Of this, notwithſtanding the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
example of the people among whom
he lived, and even of Elphinſtone himſelf,
he always brought a part to me to put by
for him. On theſe occaſions I ſometimes
queſtioned him of their manner of life in
London, whence I now entirely abſented
myſelf; and though he gave me ſuch
anſwers as would, he thought, prevent
my inquietude, he was too ingenuous to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0206900202:306"/>
be able to conceal the whole truth. Thus
my proſperity was embittered by the fear of
falling again into the adverſity, from which
we had been delivered by miracle; and I
lived in perpetual dread of evils I had no
power to prevent. Alas! the greateſt evil
was already arrived—the eſtrangement of
Elphinſtone's heart!—I ſaw it in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
inſtances; but I knew that reproaches
and importunity would not recal it; and I
endeavoured, whenever he came down to
Shene, to appear cheerful, leſt he ſhould
be quite won from me by thoſe whom he
now frequented.</p>
            <p>"Though he has an excellent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
he became inſenſibly intoxicated
with his good fortune, and never gave
himſelf time to think how ſoon it might
be at an end, till this fatal period actually
arrived. His patron was diſmiſſed from
his employment, and the golden dream
vaniſhed at once.</p>
            <p>"I then knew, that out of immenſe
ſums of money he had made, by means, of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0206900202:307"/>
which I underſtand nothing, he had not
reſerved five hundred pounds; and I knew
that a miſtreſs whom he had ſupported in
great ſplendour, had pillaged him of twenty
times that ſum. But he was now hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and unhappy! I forgave all his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
and ſhould have bleſſed the chance
that had reſtored him to me, had we but
had a competence to live upon.</p>
            <p>"After all our plate and fine furniture
in London was ſold, and our debts called
in, we found ourſelves about two hundred
pounds worſe than nothing. But Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
ſtill told me he had friends; and now
commenced a courſe of folicitation and
attendance, to which the humbleſt and
ſevereſt labour is in my mind infinitely
preferable: and in the mean time our
ſubſiſtence was derived from his writing
for the papers, and now and then by
an eighteen-penny political pamphlet.</p>
            <p>"I did not notice, that in the height
of our proſperity my brother John aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duouſly
courted our regard; and Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0206900202:308"/>
had procured him many advantages:
among others, that of being ſteward to
a nobleman, by whom he made a great
deal of money; ſo that he was, on our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
more proſperous than ever. With
our failure, however, his love failed alſo;
and all we could now obtain of him was,
to take Frank as a ſort of aſſiſtant into his
buſineſs.</p>
            <p>"My poor Emily, who from gratitude
and pity I could never wholly forſake, was
at this time abroad with her friend; and I
had nothing to ſupport me againſt the
heavy tide of adverſity but the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of having done my duty, and the firm
reliance on heaven which that conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
gave me. Four years we lingered on,
ſometimes flattered by hope of ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
place, and ſometimes ſupported by
ſmall remittances from Elphinſtone's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
while ſhe complained heavily of the
conduct of her eldeſt ſon, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
her and his ſiſters of every thing he
could take from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0206900202:309"/>
"Oh! never may thoſe who have it in
their power to ſecure an independance,
fooliſhly throw it away, and truſt to the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious
aſſurances of that friendſhip which
flouriſhes only in the ſunſhine of affluence!</p>
            <p>"Day after day did poor Elphinſtone
now attend thoſe men, who but a few
months ago were his aſſiduous friends:
many, into whoſe pockets he had been the
means of putting thouſands, now ſhut their
doors againſt him; while, of thoſe who could
not ſo eaſily eſcape from his importunity,
ſome blamed him for the expence at
which he had lived, talked of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of oeconomy, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of their own family—others very
gravely harangued on the caprice of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
the ups and downs of the world,
thanked God they had but a little, but
that little was, they hoped, ſecure; yet
moſt truly lamented that it was <hi>too</hi> little to
enable them to follow the warm dictates of
their hearts, in aiding a friend they ſo
much reſpected and eſteemed; and with
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0206900202:310"/>
this ſort of language bowed <hi>him</hi> out, whoſe
favour and recommendation they had only
a few months before ſolicited with mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
equal to their preſent ingratitude.</p>
            <p>"Wearied at length by this ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of a world to which he was ſtill
too much attached, and where, from the
vivacity of his ſanguine temper, he was
long unwilling to relinquiſh the hope of
riſing again into conſideration, he took up
once more his old projects of recovering the
money due to his father in America: and
though that country was no longer under
the government of Britain, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of ſucceſs greatly diminiſhed,
he contrived to perſuade thoſe perſons
who were intereſted, to furniſh him with a
ſmall ſupply of money; and we went, a
wandering and unhappy family, to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>"I could give you, my dear Miſs
De Mornay, a long detail of our pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age—of
our being once fixed on a farm
in the back ſettlements, and expoſed to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0206900202:311"/>
terrors from the Indians, which, with all
my courage, it was utterly out of my
power to ſupport; but I have already
been too prolix, and tired you with a
long hiſtory of ſorrow, from which your
ſenſible heart requires ſome relief.</p>
            <p>"Alas! I cannot give it you while
I dwell on my own ſad ſtory; I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as briefly as I can, conclude it,
by telling you that we were four years in
America, and two in Antigua; where my
huſband joined his own family, and tried
to eſtabliſh himſelf as a merchant. But
he was, by this time, conſidered as a
ſchemer—as an unlucky man—as one not
born to be proſperous; and this deſign
ended, like the reſt, in diſappointment.</p>
            <p>"I have obtained, however, ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
by my itinerant life; I have
learned reſignation, and have ſeen, that
almoſt every condition of humanity has
evils equal to mine, though I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
thought them inſupportable. But
in acquiring patience, hope, I own, has
eſcaped me: nor have I now any other
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0206900202:312"/>
wiſh, than to ſee my children well, and to
be able to find them bread.</p>
            <p>"The diſtinctions of rank have long
ſince too been loſt to me, who have paſſed
from competence to extreme poverty, from
extreme poverty to high affluence, and
have again fallen to all the miſeries of
dependence and indigence. When Frank,
therefore, firſt declared to me his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Jeſſy Woodburn, I oppoſed his
marriage, not from pride, but from the
apprehenſion of redoubling his difficulties.
I then, it is true, depended almoſt entirely
on the generous aſſiſtance of that excellent
brother; but, believe me, that would never
have induced me to oppoſe what was
requiſite to his happineſs. I had not
known Jeſſy long before I loſt every idea
of oppoſition to it, and I wiſhed to ſee
them married long before I knew what
favourable proſpects might one day open
to the object of his affection. To foreſee
to whom ſhe would owe the realizing thoſe
proſpects, to whom ſhe would afterwards
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0206900202:313"/>
be the means of my being known, was,
you know, impoſſible."</p>
            <p>"And where, my dear Madam," en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Celeſtina, "where was Mr. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
at the time you ſpeak of?"</p>
            <p>"He was gone again to Antigua, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his mother's death. I was left with
four children, and ſo little money, that
heaven only knows what would have
become of them and of me, had it
not been for Frank."</p>
            <p>"And your ſiſter Emily!—I cannot help
being intereſted for her with all her
failings."</p>
            <p>"Ah! would to heaven I knew what
was now her lot! I loſt all traces of her
after my going to America; nor could
mine or Frank's moſt aſſiduous enquiries
ever ſince, gain any intelligence. She
has changed her name, or taken ſome
other means to avoid us; circumſtances
that make me fear ſhe is ſunk below her
former brilliant but diſcreditable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
condition. When I think of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0206900202:314"/>
her and of my children, my ſtoiciſm
forſakes me—and of her, unleſs I could
ſnatch her from a manner of life ſo
terrible, I endeavour not to think; for
the thoughts of what ſhe is, and of what
ſhe may be, I am very frequently unable
to bear. You will allow, my dear Miſs De
Mornay, that my own ſituation requires
all my courage. A new and perhaps an
abortive project now carries me to the
remoteſt part of Scotland—with a heart,
I hope not callous, but exhauſted by
long ſuffering. My huſband is amiable,
good tempered, and, I believe, truly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
to me; but he is ſo volatile!
ſo unſteady! misfortune has made him
reſtleſs, and his deſultory life encreaſed
the original blemiſh of his temper—a
want of firmneſs; from which have ariſen
ſome of the evils that have purſued us.</p>
            <p>"One of his ſome-time friends procured
him the little appointment he now holds,
rather to get rid of his importunity, I
think, than to do him real ſervice. It
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0206900202:315"/>
may, however, afford us a reſidence and a
ſupport, and I need not ſay that its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from the ſcene of our former proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
and former adverſity is to me its
greateſt recommendation. If my huſband
can learn to be content among the cold
and dreary Hebrides, if my children have
there health, food, and ſhelter, never ſhall I
be heard to repine; and indeed my journey,
in having you for my companion, begins
under auſpices ſo favourable, that my heart,
dead to hope as it has long been, is yet not
inſenſible of ſomething that nearly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
it."</p>
            <p>This converſation brought the travellers
to the end of their third day's ſtage; and
Celeſtina, more than ever intereſted for Mrs.
Elphinſtone, forgot for a moment every
thing but the ſeries of undeſerved calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to which ſhe had been liſtening.</p>
