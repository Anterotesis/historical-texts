            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. <hi>The Reaſons for Publiſhing this Treatiſe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may perhaps be wonder'd at, why a Subject of ſo very nice a Nature as this is, ſhould here be undertaken, ſine in all Manner of Crimes of Impurity and Uncleanneſs, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is generally much more adviſeable, than even ſo much as once to mention them:</p>
            <p>And this for fear of putting <hi>That</hi> into any Perſon's Mind, which it were much better they cou'd <hi>for ever,</hi> either For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, or be wholly Ignorant of as long as they live.</p>
            <p>But as this Branch of Uncleanneſs, <hi>viz. Sinning with a Perſon's own Self,</hi> is the moſt general of any Sin of Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whatſoever, by conſequence ſome Inſtructions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, are the moſt of any wanted in the World, in order to awake the Guilty, and deterr the Innocent and Unwary from falling into it, thro Inadvertence or Ignorance.</p>
            <p>There are a great many admirable Treatiſes extant on the ſeveral other Branches and Sins of Impurity, but very few (if any) really SERIOUS ones upon <hi>This.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, why leſs ſhould have been written on <hi>This</hi> one Sin than others, ſeems to proceed from the Nature of the Crime it ſelf, and the Difficulty of managing it with ſuch Prudence and Caution, as neither to omit what is neceſſary to be ſaid, nor to ſay any Thing that may ſeem indecent,</p>
            <p>And this is the true Reaſon of the Scarceity of Books on this Sin in particular; and yet never was more need of diſſuaſive Inſtructions againſt it than now, when Debauchery is become ſo bare-faced, that the generality of Mankind are neither affraid, nor aſhamed to glory in it.</p>
            <p>So that when People come to this Height of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, 'tis high time to warn them of their Folly and Danger, leſt Almighty God's Anger break in by a ſudden Death upon them, and there be no eſcaping.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0208500301:15"/>
            <p>Upon Enquiry then, how it comes to paſs, that this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable unhappy Sin of Self-Defilement reigns ſo in all Places as it does, it muſt be own'd, that one of the chief Reaſons is, the great Scarceity of ſerious Inſtructive Books to give Aſſiſtance in relation to it.</p>
            <p>For certainly, if Perſons did but rightly underſtand the Hainouſneſs of this Sin, and the convincing Reaſons and Motives there are for refraining from it, it would be much Rarer than it is: But the Miſery is, Chriſtians are not ſufficiently informed of this Matter:</p>
            <p>Authors that have writ of the Sins of Impurity, have (out of a well deſign'd indeed Modeſty) only treated of this Sin in general: So that there are ſcarce any Books ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, that ſufficiently ſupply the want of Inſtruction about IT in particular: Inſomuch, that whilſt there ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wicked Books that encourage this abominable Vice, there are hardly any for reclaiming Perſons from it.</p>
            <p>This Obſervation makes it juſtly to be conclude, that a diſſuaſive Diſcourſe againſt this reigning Sin in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, cannot fail of being very uſeful to the World:</p>
            <p>And this more eſpecially ſince there is no Guilty Perſon but had much rather inſtruct themſelves by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Book</hi> privately in their Chamber by themſelves on this Sin, than they can well bear to hear another ſpeak to them about it, it being a Subject of ſo very a ſhocking Nature, that no one Cares either to ſpeak, or be ſpoken to of it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of this is: Becauſe altho Perſons may be ſo far abandoned, as ſometimes to make their Brags of other Sins, yet they always dread being known to be Guilty of THIS, it is ſo very Shameful, Odious and Unnatural.</p>
            <p>And therefore in treating this Sin, the Caſe is not the ſame, as in treating on other moral Subjects.</p>
            <p>For, in handling other Subjects, a Man may ſafely ſay whatever he thinks any ways advantageous to his Deſign, and has nothing to hinder him from mentioning what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he apprehends neceſſary, and propoſing his Arguments in their utmoſt Extent and Force, making them as plain as poſſible, and anſwering all Difficulties relating to them.</p>
            <p>But in arguing againſt this Sin of Self-Defilement, the ſame Liberty is not to be taken; but a Writer is extremely confined, and is obliged to expreſs himſelf with all. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and Caution, for fear of intrenching upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, whilſt he endeavours to make himſelf underſtood.</p>
            <p>For which Reaſon, whoever treats this Subject, is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to abſtain from preſſing his Reaſonings near ſo home or from enforcing his Proofs with that Degree of Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they might otherwiſe have had.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0208500301:16"/>
            <p>And therefore in treating of this particular Branch of Impurity, ſome Points might be much more enlarged, and many Objections more particularly conſidered:</p>
            <p>But then this would neceſſitate the touching upon ſome Things which Decency forbids.</p>
            <p>Whatever then Decency commands throughout this Treatiſe to be mentioned only in general, ſhall be never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſo ordered by Principles that ſhall be laid down, as to give ſufficient room to every attentive (but more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly every guilty) Reader fully to underſtand and themſelves ſupply. And therefore this Subject, how <hi>Dirty</hi> ſoever it may in it ſelf be, ſhall here be wrapt up in the <hi>Clean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Cloathing that poſſibly it can.</p>
            <p>To diſwade againſt an Action that is above others:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> So very Hainous, and Unnatural in its ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> So very abominable and diſpleaſing before Almighty God: — And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> So highly pernicious to Perſon's Selves and Families, both as to Body and Soul, requires no Arguments which are not entirely agreable to Truth, and can ſtand the Teſt of the ſtricteſt Reaſon to the greateſt of Libertines, as in the following Chapters will fully appear: — All which being duly conſidered:</p>
            <p>It would be very deplorable, if Young and ignorant People ſhould remain without Warning and Aſſiſtance againſt ſo powerful, ſo treacherous, and domeſtick and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as the Sin of Self-Defilement is, merely for want of being better inſtructed, concerning the Abomination of it.</p>
            <p>Youth are in greater Danger of this Sin, than of any other, there being far ſtronger Incitements and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to it (as being within our ſelves) than to any other Sin whatſoever, the Fewel and Treacherous inticement to it always accompanying us wherever we go:</p>
            <p>For: Let us change never ſo much from one Place to another, we always carry our Selves and our own corrupt vicious Inclinations along with us, changing only the Place, but not the Man; and therefore <hi>Horace</hi> juſtly ſays, <hi>Caelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who even Paſs the Seas, change only the Climate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Man, than a Change of mere Cloaths only does; and every one is fully convinced that <hi>Habitus non facit Monachum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Occaſions of other Sins may be avoided and run <hi>Away</hi>

            <p>And therefore 'tis betraying OUR SELVES, that is our greateſt Danger, as is admirably, and with an uncommon <hi>Inction,</hi> expreſs'd by a late pious Author in the following lymn.</p>

            <p>Man having no greater Enemy againſt HIMSELF, than HIMSELF; as our Saviour expreſly tells us. <hi>Math.</hi> chap. 10. v. 36. <hi>Inimici hominis Domeſtici ejus.</hi> Every Man's worſt Enemy is from his OWN SELF.</p>
            <p>All which makes it a Matter of juſt Lamentation, that a Vice ſo odious in its Nature, and ſo pernicious in its Conſequences, ſhould have ſuch forcible Means to inſinuate it ſelf ſo far among the flouriſhing, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the youthful) Part of Mankind, as to become ſo general as it is, and no inſtructive Books to deter from it extant:</p>
            <p>It being almoſt certain, that many Delinquents would never have been ſuch, if they had but had ſome good Book to have read on this Subject, that might have informed and inſtructed them of, and pointed out to them the Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of this Sin in particular, and the deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences that follow it, to the Ruin of Body and Poſterity in this World, and of Soul in the next.</p>
            <p>Hence 'tis hoped, that putting this Book into the World, may prove a prevalent Means to hinder many a one from being falſly lull'd a ſleep, and indulging themſelves in this abominable Vice, by furniſhing them with the ſtrongeſt Conſiderations how hainous a Crime it is, what terrible Effects follow from it, how it Baſely defiles every Perſon's Body that commits it, Tortures and racks the Mind, ruins ſo many hail flouriſhing Conſtitutions, and leads the ready Way to the Paths of Death, and eternal Deſtruction.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0208500301:18"/>
            <p>So that notwithſtanding the State of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> was ſo very deplorable as every one that has but read the 19th Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> knows it to be, on account of their enormous Lewdneſſes, and unnatural Debaucheries:</p>
            <p>Yet our Bleſſed Saviour tells us, that the Condition of Chriſtians who act theſe abominations with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, will be far worſe in the Day of Judgment:</p>
            <p>The Thought of which, how much ſoever any abandon'd <hi>Onanian</hi> may divert and put off from himſelf for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet it will one Day, to their eternal Wailling and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row come upon them, unleſs they truly repent.</p>
            <p>Now to any conſidering Perſon, can the momentary ſatisfying of a Filthy Paſſion, be ever worth all this Miſery?</p>
            <p>Since as an ancient Author truly ſays, 'tis only <hi>Momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneum quod delectat,</hi> but 'tis <hi>Aeternum quod cruciat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For one only Moments Pleaſure, every <hi>Onanian</hi> incurs an Eternity of Wailing, Torments, Miſery, and Sorrow.</p>
            <p>Whoever acts ſuch vile Things, is perfectly his own Slave, and is led on by his own Paſſion, as the Scripture ſays, <hi>As an Ox goes to the Slaughter,</hi> or, <hi>As a Bird haſtens to the Snare,</hi> to his own Death and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ways are the Ways of Ruin, and AT BEST can end in nothing but Grief and Repentance, if ever any <hi>Onanian</hi> be ſo happy as to grieve and repent for them.</p>
            <p>O dear bought Moment of Pleaſure! A Bargain the moſt to be regretted, that certainly ever any poor Sinner made, to purchaſe ſo many Evils, and ſuch a Train of Miſeries, for one only Moments Satisfaction, in the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of which every <hi>Onanian</hi> ſhews himſelf much more ſtupid than a ſilly Fly in a Candle, that has ſome Cauſe to take the Flame to be ſweet, becauſe it is beautiful.</p>
            <p>For the little Fly ſeeing the Flame, hovers greedily about it, to try whether it be as ſweet as it ſeems fair, and carried away with this Fancy, periſhes at the firſt trial.</p>
            <p>But a poor <hi>Onanian</hi> knows very well, that what he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about is extremely filthy and ill in it ſelf, highly offenſive to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> and utterly ruinous to his own Perſon, and yet WILL commit the horrid Fact.</p>
            <p>O Man! What art thou? An ancient Poet had Reaſon to ſay, <hi>Video Meliora, Proboque: Deteriora ſequor.</hi> He SEES and knows, that the filthy Action he is going about, will be his Ruin, and yet He is reſolved, He WILL do it.</p>
            <p>And all this for want of rightly conſidering the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable State this Sin involves him in; which ſeriouſly, <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rongly, and homely to repreſent to him, is the Deſign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his difficult Subject.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0208500301:19"/>
            <p>But as it is ſo hard a Matter to write on a Subject of ſo nice a Nature as this is, within the reach of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Capacities, without Danger of Encroachments upon the Bounds of Decency, and the Riſque of giving Offence to chaſt Minds, notwithſtanding it may proceed from a Deſign to promote Virtue and diſcourage Vice:</p>
            <p>Therefore this Subject ſhall be here ſo treated, as to be rather leſs intelligible to ſome, by leaving ſeveral things to every Readers private Conſideration, than by any over-freedom of Expreſſion, to run the Hazard of putting <hi>That</hi> into any chaſt Mind, which every Perſon ought with the utmoſt Chriſtian Courage and Care to ſtifle and deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Subjects of this Nature being as Dr. <hi>Baynard</hi> calls, it <hi>Res faeda dictu,</hi> an Action unfit to be even mentioned, and therefore the Scripture calls it a <hi>deteſtable Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what, if mere Neceſſity (in order to deter the World from it,) did not urge, St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> a People wholly abandoned to their Luſt and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, forbids even to be ſo much as named amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. <hi>Let all Uncieanneſs be not once Named amongſt you.</hi> ch. 5. ver. 3. <hi>Nee Nominetur in vobis,</hi> ſays the Vulgate Edition.</p>
            <p>For which Reaſon, if ever Caution, Care, Waryneſs, and Circumſpection is neceſſary, in the treating of any Moral Subject, in the World, 'tis moſt certainly in this, wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought he could expreſs the Enormity of the Crime in no ſtronger a Manner, than by impoſing a perpetual Silence of it amongſt all Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>'Tis not to be doubted, but thoſe Perſons who are conſcious to themſelves of having unhappily bartered and exchanged away their Innocence for a momentary Satisfaction, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did his Birth-right for the preſent tranſient Senſuality of a Meſs of Pottage, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence have the Misfortune to find themſelves concerned in this preſent Treatiſe, will ſufficiently underſtand the Meaning of it without much Explication, and 'tis to them it is recommended, with a hearty deſire of their moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration of what is contained in it.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe whom it no way concerns, and by conſequence who underſtand it not (O happy Ignorance!) their unſpotted Innocence is to be congratulated:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rara avis in terris!</hi> It ſhall be endeavoured that nothing be ſaid here, which may endanger then looſing it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm their happy keeping it:</p>
            <p>All poſſible Care then ſhall be taken throughout this Treatiſe that no Expreſſion be uſed, which may either ſhock the moſt modeſt Claſs of Mankind, or ſully or give offence to even the chaſteſt Mind.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Heinouſneſs and Abomination of the Sin of Self-Defilement.</head>
            <p>BY the Word <hi>Self-Defilement,</hi> is here meant that unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ſhameful Action, by which Perſons of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex endeavour to cauſe, procure, and imitate with themſelves that Senſual Carnal Pleaſure, which <hi>Alm. God</hi> has ordered to attend only a Married State for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Mankind: The hainouſneſs of which Action fully appears from that remarkable Inſtance in the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> of its ſevere <hi>Puniſhment</hi> by <hi>Almighty God</hi> in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Onan,</hi> in the Eighth and Thirtieth Chapter of <hi>Gen.</hi> Verſe the 10th, expreſſed in theſe <hi>Words, And therefore the Lord ſlew him, becauſe he had done a</hi> Deteſtable <hi>Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ideo percuſſit eum Dominus, quod rem</hi> DETESTABILEM <hi>faceret,</hi> ſays the Vulgate Edition.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cambridge</hi> Edition of the Bible has it thus, <hi>And the Thing which he did, diſpleaſed the Lord, wherefore He ſlew him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the very Name of ONAN is fully ſufficient to put the Reader at once in mind both of the Sin, and the dreadful Puniſhment inflicted on him for it.</p>
            <p>The other particulars of this unhappy Man <hi>Onan,</hi> in the perpetration of this Deteſtable Action, as the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> Purpoſely calls it, to make it to be the more abhorred, and deteſted by all Mankind, as long as the World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, ſhall not be here mentioned, but every Reader is refer'd to the ſerious peruſal of the juſt now cited Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where every one may read the whole Hiſtory at length, (as alſo of his Brother <hi>Er,</hi> who was likewiſe Slain for the ſame Fact) tranſmitted as dreadful Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to all ſucceeding Ages, to deter from an Action ſo unnatural in it ſelf, that no Brute is ever known to do it, but only (to his Shame be it ſpoken) unhappy Man.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is very reaſonable to believe, that a great many Perſons would never fall into this Sin, if they were but throly convinced of the grievouſneſs of it, and the deplorable Conſequences to the Body in this World, as well as to the Soul in the next, which follow from it:</p>
            <p>Which makes it highly neceſſary, that Perſons ſhould be appriſed how crying an Offence it is, in order to keep them from it.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0208500301:21"/>
            <p>In Order then to this, it is remarkable, that there is no Place in the whole Scripture, where Sins of Impurity and Uncleanneſs are condemned, but <hi>This Unhappy One</hi> here treated of, is in a more particular Manner than others Pointed out to us, with a Concluſion, that <hi>Nothing Defiled, nor who</hi> ACTS WITH THEMSELVES <hi>ſuch</hi> Abominable <hi>Things, ſhall ever enter the Kingdom of God, but are to have their Share and Part hi the Lake, that Burns with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to give us ſtill a more thorough Conviction of the particular Deformity, Filthyneſs, Baſeneſs, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalneſs, that there is in this Vice, above others.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of it in the Heathens ſays, that they, being a People wholly given up, and abandon'd to their Lewdneſs and Uncleanneſs, by this particular Vice above others <hi>Diſhonoured their own Bodies,</hi> Rom. 1.24.</p>
            <p>And therefore gives a ſingular Charge to the Chriſtians he wrote to, never to imitate them in the commiſſion of this Deteſtable Action. <hi>Be not deceived</hi> (ſays he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ch. 6.10.) <hi>neither the Effeminate, nor the</hi> ABOMINABLE, <hi>ſhall ever inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Vulgate Edition of the Bible has it thus. MOLLES (an Ugly Word enough) <hi>Regnum Dei non poſſideb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Cambridge</hi> Edition of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible has it thus, <hi>Neither the Effeminate, nor</hi> ABUSERS OF THEMSELVES, <hi>ſhall ever inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.10.</p>
            <p>Where the Words ABUSING A PERSON'S SELF are uſed, to expreſs with as much Modeſty as is poſſible the Unnatural Action this Treatiſe is here writ againſt.</p>
            <p>For of all the Actions which a rational Creature CAN poſſibly commit, within the whole Latitude and Exten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of his Liberty and Power, there is no One, by which Perſons ſo egregiouſly ABUSE, and Baſely Diſhonour themſelves, as by this one Vile Action of Self-Defilement.</p>
            <p>And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that the Heathens by theſe unclean Filthy Actions, not only Abuſed and Defiled, <hi>but ſhamefully Diſhonoured</hi> their own Bodies.</p>
            <p>This ſingularly modeſt Man St. <hi>Paul</hi> was indeed loath to Rake ſo particularly into the Nature of the Action, as to expreſs it in any Manner whatſoever, and therefore</p>
            <p>Firſt tells the Chriſtians of the Church at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> c. 5. ver. 12. That <hi>He was even aſhamed to mention and ſpeak of thoſe Things the Heathens did</hi> IN SECRET, meaning the Crime of Self-Defilement, which was ſo common amongſt them:</p>
            <p>But finding himſelf under a Neceſſity of ſpeaking plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, leſt they ſhould not underſtand his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he choſe out at leaſt the modeſteſt Words to explain himſelf by to them, that he could.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0208500301:22"/>
            <p>Not at all doubting, but that thoſe Chriſtians who ſhould hear his Letters read (as they uſually were eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on <hi>Sundays</hi> amongſt the Primitive Chriſtians in their Aſſemblies) would fuſty underſtand his Meaning, and what Sin it was he forewarned them againſt.</p>
            <p>And concludes with a modeſt Repetition in general of all he had ſaid before, in theſe Words, That <hi>All thoſe who</hi> DO SUCH THINGS <hi>ſhall never inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore he charges them every one, <hi>To Poſſeſs,</hi> Preſerve, and Keep <hi>His Veſſel</hi> (that s their Bodies) <hi>in Holineſs and Honour.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, That all Sorts of Perſons (without Exception) ought to be extremely watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over THEIR OWN BODIES, and never to Abuſe nor Defile them by ſuch unnatural Actions. — Again.</p>
            <p>St <hi>Paul</hi> (who throughout his whole Miſſion, had always to do, with an abominably Luſtful and Luxurious Set of Men, as fully appears from thoſe unnatural Vices he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends in the Inhabitants of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Epheſus, Coloſſia, Theſalonica,</hi> and thoſe other Provinces aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to Luxury, which he writ his Letters to) thought he could produce no more powerful Argument to diſſwade them from this foul Sin, than to tell them, that their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being the Temples of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> by conſequence to defile and abuſe ſuch a Temple muſt be the higheſt Offence againſt to Almighty God. — His Argument is this.</p>
            <p>That if material Temples and Churches built only of Stone, and Mortar, and dediated to the external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip only of God Almighty, are in no wiſe to be profaned:</p>
            <p>Much leſs Spiritual ones, ſuch as our Bodies are, in which the Spirit and Grace of Almighty God, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul honoured with his own Image, inhabits.</p>
            <p>This Argument of this Great Apoſtle, and Reclaimer of thoſe Luſtful Luxurious People, gives us clearly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that whenever any Perſon commits any filthy and immodeſt Action with themſelves, their Body is then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned, Sullied, and Defiled, and no more a Temple or Place for God Almighty's Grace to reſide in.</p>
            <p>And leaſt Perſons ſhou'd object, that hereby they do no Injury to any but themſelves, their Bodies being their own, and at their own diſpoſal, this great Preacher of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (foreſeeing this their Objection) tells them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that their Bodies are not their OWN, nor at their own diſpoſal, no more than when a Perſon has BOUGHT any Thing, the Thing ſo bought belongs no more to the Perſon who Sold it; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that they are <hi>Bought and Redeemed with a great Pric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0208500301:23"/>
            <p>This Conſideration made St. <hi>Austin</hi> cry out, <hi>O quam lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda perverſitas! Ut quis animam quam Chriſtus Sanguine ſuo</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demit, <hi>propter unius momenti Delectationem Diabolo vendat. Serm.</hi> 350. O Madneſs! To ſell that Soul which Chriſt has BOUGHT, for one Moment of Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew that when St <hi>Paul</hi> mentioned this, he alluded particularly to the Sin here treated of, he preſently adds theſe Words, <hi>And therefore we ought to ſerve God in our</hi> BODIES, <hi>which are God's, as well as our Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again: As the greateſt Puniſhment that can be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the taking away any ones Life, ſo when an Offence is ſo puniſhed, it moſt certainly ſhews that ſuch a Crime is of a moſt hainous and grievous Nature:</p>
            <p>Almighty God in the Scriptures, threatens a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sins with ſeveral Sorts of Puniſhments, ſome of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſome of ſhorter Durance, but this Sin of <hi>Onan,</hi> had immediate Death inflicted for it, which is the greateſt Proof of God Almighty's being highly offended at it.</p>
            <p>And if any one examines the whole Scripture thro, where mention is made of Vices and Sins, they will find that there is not any other Crime, ſo many times inveighed againſt, as Sins of Uncleanneſs</p>
            <p>A moſt deteſtable and unnatural <hi>Degree</hi> of which is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's <hi>Defiling their own Selves;</hi> and againſt which St. <hi>Paul</hi> is continually preaching, accuſing the Heathens of this Sin in particular, and tells them of their Diſhonouring their own Bodies by it.—Hence a learned Divine ſays of it,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Crime in it ſelf is Monſtrous and Unnatural:</hi>

            <p>THE BLINDNESS here meant, is that ſpiritual <hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and Unconcernedneſs, with which miſerable <hi>Onanians</hi> repeat this Crime.—For as for thoſe particular pernicious Effects which this Sin has proper to it ſelf above all other Vices, on the SIGHT and EYES of the Body by draining off thoſe animal Spirits, which are ſo the peculiar Strength of the <hi>Optick Nerves,</hi> as that Perſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to this Vice, will find their <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Eyes</hi> to fail them a deal ſooner than otherwſie they would, to their great Grief and Sorrow afterwards, when it is too late; this Subjects ſhall be particularly treated of hereafter.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Sin here treated of, attributes the Commiſſion of it to <hi>Blindneſs</hi> and <hi>Inſenſibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſays, that the <hi>Gentiles, Being paſt feeling: had given themſelves over to Act all Uncleanneſs</hi> WITH THEMSELVES <hi>with Greedineſs.</hi>—And for this Reaſon St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Blindneſs</hi> a juſt Puniſhment of Almighty God upon Sins of Impurity, <hi>Spargit Deus paenales caecitates ſuper illici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas corum cupiditates.</hi> Almighty God throws a Darkneſs on the Underſtanding as a particular Puniſhment for this Sin:</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that of thoſe great Numbers that are guilty of it, very few ever come to be truly ſenſible of it, but are lull'd aſleep in it, and eternally looſe their Soul.</p>
            <p>A Loſs, to ballance which our Saviour expreſly tells us, that even the gaining of the whole World is not an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent. <hi>What Profit is it to a Man to gain the whole World, if he loſes his own Soul.</hi> Math. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>Verſe</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>The ſaving of which is every ones greateſt Affair, and every ones only Affair that he came into this World For:</p>
            <p>'Tis the <hi>Unum neceſſarium,</hi> that <hi>One Thing</hi> which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour declares to be only <hi>Neceſſary</hi> for all Mankind:</p>
            <p>'Tis not <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to be great, to be Rich, and abound with the Things of this World, but it is abſolutely <hi>Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to be ſaved: And yet <hi>Onanians</hi> are ſo ſtupidly Blind, as to exchange this Thing ſo <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſaving themſelves for all Eternity, for the gratifying this <hi>Luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what ſpiritual Darkneſs muſt ſurround ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is thus ſtark Blind in this <hi>Neceſſary</hi> Concern, and ſo clear ſighted in other things that are Trifles?</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0208500301:25"/>
            <p>Yet there is one Thing more contradictory ſtill, which is, that a Perſon ſhall with all the Unconcernedneſs of Mind imaginable fall into, and repeat this <hi>Crime</hi> over and over again, which he knows in his Conſcience is a deadly Sin, and not only cuts off at once, without bearing any Manner of Diſpute in the Matter, his Right for ever to the Kingdom of Heaven, but condemns him to the eternal Fire and Torments of Hell:</p>
            <p>And yet at the ſame Time, out of a Principle of Religion and Chriſtianity, would not take a Falſe Oath, nor renounce his Religion for all the World.</p>
            <p>Again: How many are there in the World, who are punctually juſt Men in their Dealings, no Swearers, no Drunkards, nor addicted to any viſible Vice, and firmly believe all the Truths of Chriſtian Religion, and yet fall Victims to themſelves, and the filthy Cravings of their own beaſtly Bodies, by living in this abominable Sin.</p>
            <p>But what will all this avail them? <hi>Quid prodeſt</hi> (ſays an ancient Author) <hi>ſi quis Catholicè credat, &amp; Gentiliter vivat? Petr. Dam.</hi> What good does any Perſon's believing as a Chriſtian do him, if he acts like a Heathen, and does not uſe that Faith, as a Guide and Rule for his Actions?</p>
            <p>How can any Perſon reconcile their Faith with ſuch a Practice? And how can they make ſuch a Practice, and their Reaſon agree? 'Tis very ſurpriſing, that Men of Senſe and Wiſdom, who Reaſon ſo well about every Thing elſe, ſhould Reaſon ſo very falſly in <hi>This?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A poor blind <hi>Onanian</hi> freely owns his Action to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Crime, highly offenſive to God Almighty, and if unrepented of, moſt certainly throws him for all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into Hell Fire: All this he will argue over with the ſtrongeſt of Reaſoning and Eloquene with himſelf, and yet will habitually live in this odious Sin.</p>
            <p>From whence can this Stupidity, and contradicting thus his own Reaſon proceed? He believes the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, and is ready to Die rather than renounce this Faith, altho they are not only above his Underſtanding, but even ſeem to ſhock his Reaſon:</p>
            <p>And at the ſame equally believes theſe abominable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he lives in the commiſſion of, to be grievous Sins, and that the doing of them condemns him for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Hell Fire, and yet WILL do them.</p>
            <p>Whence come theſe ſo very unaccountable Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thus between an <hi>Onanian</hi>'s Life, and his Faith?</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of this can be nothing elſe, but becauſe the believing the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, does not contradict nor thwart his Paſſions:</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0208500301:26"/>
            <p>So that altho it is as equally certain that an <hi>Onanian</hi> will be eternally Loſt for the commiſſion of theſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Actions, as he would be, if he renounced his Faith, and turned Heathen, both being alike grounded on the ſame infallible Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word of God:</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe the one does not contradict his Paſſions, and the other does, therefore for the ſake of a Moment's Pleaſure, he will thus contradict, and act againſt his own Reaſon, and give himſelf for all his Life time after, ſuch vaſt Room for Grief and Repentance.</p>
            <p>What a ſort of Faith ſhall we call this?</p>
            <p>'Tis a <hi>Dead Faith;</hi> which can no more ſave an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Onanian,</hi> than the moſt moral good Works will ſave an obſtinate Heathen. Now let an <hi>Onanian</hi> ask himſelf ſeriouſly, whether he really believes all this or not?</p>
            <p>If he does not believe any thing of this, then he does in other things a great deal too much, by being a juſt Man in his Dealings where ſafe Opportunities of Gain by Frauds offer themſelves without ever being detected:</p>
            <p>By not being a Drunkard, a Swearer, an Adulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which corrupt Nature inclines to.</p>
            <p>And if he does really believe theſe Truths, then 'tis beyond Diſpute, that he does not do near enough.</p>
            <p>What then is this Faith? What is this offending God Almighty? This Soul and its being either ſaved for all <hi>Eternity,</hi> or loſt for all <hi>Eternity,</hi> that is ſo much talked of?</p>
            <p>'Tis in reality nothing elſe but this: That a great many ſay they believe the Truths of Chriſtian Religion, becauſe they will be of the Faſhion of the <hi>Country</hi> where they live:</p>
            <p>So that in Rigour, ſuch Perſons calling themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, is no more than conforming to Cuſtom and Faſhion.</p>
            <p>For elſe; as no Man ever in his Senſes, would travel any particular Road, if he was credibly informed and firmly believed that there were High-way-men and Robbers in that very Road, that would murder him:</p>
            <p>So, either this is the exact Condition of every <hi>Onanian,</hi> or elſe his Faith, the Goſpel and Chriſtian Religion muſt ſeem to him as a Fable, our Saviour an Impoſtor, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> a Lyar and a Cheat, thus to perſwade Men from and threaten them out of their Pleaſure, and taking their Swing in <hi>This</hi> World, for a mere Nothing in the <hi>Next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if a Heathen was to be asked his Opinion of ſuch a Perſon, that ſays he believes what the Chriſtian Religion teaches, and yet acts ſo contrary to it, he would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer, that either he does not really believe, or elſe, that he is a Madman to act ſo oppoſite to his Faith.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the great Damages the Sin of Self-Defilement brings upon a Perſon's ſelf and Family.</head>
            <p>THE Damage this grievous Sin brings upon many a Family fully appears, from thoſe Numbers of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies ſo frequently extinct for want of Heirs:</p>
            <p>Which Misfortune were it to be traced up to its Origin, is owing to nothing elſe but that Impotency in one Sex, and Barrenneſs in the other, cauſed by thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Actions here treated of, by which the Strength of Youth has been ſo nipt in its Bud, by having been ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely ſquandred away, that very few can afterwards much boaſt of the Fruits of a married State.</p>
            <p>And altho it be ſuppoſed, that ſuch Perſons ever have Children, (which nevertheleſs happens not often) they are moſt commonly weak puny little ſickly Things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that either die ſoon, or if they happen by chance, and mere Force more of Phyſick than the Kitchen, to live and grow up, they prove generally but tender ſickly Perſons, always ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and complaining of one Malady or another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What a Pleaſure is it to ſee</hi> (ſays an ancient Author) <hi>a Man at the Age of Fourſcore, with a Wife of the ſame Antiquity, both bleſſed with healthy hail Conſtitutions, freſh wholeſome Looks, ſound Minds and perfect quick Senſes,</hi> (Mens ſana in corporo ſano as <hi>Juvenal</hi> deſcribes) <hi>with active ſtrait upright Limbs:</hi>

               <hi>Walking without the adventitious Support of either Stick or Staff, with pleaſant chearful Tempers, reſiding over a healthful numerous Progeny, perhaps to the third or fourth Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all theſe Bleſſings owing under Almighty God, to the Temperance, and Continence of their Youths.</p>
            <p>When, if we do but turn our Eyes upon Licentious and Voluptuous Livers, we ſhall find them ſurrounded with a whole Legion and Complication of Diſeaſes:</p>

            <p>And if they happen to arrive at any advanced Years, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And all this from having enervated, exhauſted, conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and Worn out their Bodies and Strength by theſe deteſtable Actions and Sins of their Youth here meant, and thereby now become the Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What a melancholy Reflection muſt it be for ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think now on theſe vile filthy Actions of their Life paſt? Who being hardly come at half the Age they might reaſonably have expected to arrive at, find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves now enervated, conſumed, drained, waſted, and out by this deteſtable Habit of Self-Defilement.</p>
            <p>What a diſmal Thing is it for a Perſon thus to ſee themſelves on a ſudden become Old, and perfectly Worn out, by having thus deſtroyed and ruined themſelves, oftentimes before they are even 30 Years of Age?</p>
            <p>Again: Of thoſe unhappy and unthinking Perſons who have by theſe Actions in their Lives paſt thus proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Beſides <hi>Stranguries, Gleets, Gonorrhoeas,</hi> &amp;c. far more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be cured, than thoſe very <hi>Same</hi> Ailments when otherwiſe contracted from ſome ill Diſtemper or its Cure.</p>
            <p>So that we'll ſuppoſe <hi>Two</hi> Perſons to be afflicted with what is commonly called a <hi>Gleet</hi> either in Men, or a <hi>Draining Weakneſs</hi> in Women, by either of which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood an <hi>Involuntary,</hi> and almoſt conſtant <hi>Efflux</hi> or <hi>Coming</hi> away of Matter from a Human Body.</p>
            <p>In one of theſe Perſons, theſe <hi>Infirmities,</hi> whether in a Man or Woman, we'll ſuppoſe to be purely the Effect of either ſome Former ill Diſtemper, or its Cure:</p>
            <p>In the other Perſon we'll ſuppoſe theſe <hi>Infirmities,</hi> to proceed purely from the Weakneſs of the Parts, whoſe Tone, Springineſs, and Strength, has been enervated and deſtroyed <hi>(as will hereafter be ſhewed)</hi> by thoſe unnatural Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here treated of.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0208500301:29"/>
            <p>This <hi>Laſt Gleet</hi> or <hi>Weakneſs</hi> whether in Man or Woma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Reaſon of this will be obvious to every Perſon who does but conſider, that the Actions by which Perſon thus defile themſelves, being altogether UNNATURAL by conſequence are ſo many repeated <hi>Violences, Strains,</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> too fatally Experience, who ever in their Lives paſt have been guilty of this abominable Practice.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch that a great many Young Perſons of either Sex, who were ſtrong, hail, and luſty before they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned themſelves to this Vice, have been ſo worn out by it, as to become old before half their Years came on.</p>
            <p>For by thus robbing and violently Forcing from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their Strength, and empoveriſhing their Spirits, by depriving their Bodies of its Balmy, and vital Juice, by this deteſtable Vice, they have become ſo dry and emacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to be ſent to their Graves a great many Years ſooner than otherwiſe they would have been.</p>
            <p>And indeed nothing is ſo common as the Experience that this Sin brings upon its Slaves, not only various Aches, and Pains about the Body, Head-achs, Dizzyneſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and ſuch a Waſting of the Spirits, as to impair the very Vitals, and bring Rottenneſs upon the Bones.</p>
            <p>But Numbers of Perſons who were healthy and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gave themſelves over to this vile Habit, have been ſo weakned, and drained by it, as to have been brought into a viſible Conſumption, and ſo far gone, as to puzzle ſometimes the beſt of Phyſicians to ſet them on their Legs again, their Caſe has been ſo deſperate.</p>
            <p>From all which it plainly appears, that no Sin draws i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Your Soul oppreſſed and over whelm'd with Fear, your Heart already ſeized by the Convulſions of Death, your Breath failing, your Colour changed, your Eyes juſt ready to cloſe themſelves for ever to Time, and open in a new State to Eternity, of which you know nothing.</p>

            <p>He who a few Days ago was ſtrong and in perfect Health, and in the full Enjoyment of his Pleaſures, is now all on a ſudden confin'd to his Bed, reduced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remity, unable to help himſelf, uncapable of Pleaſure <hi>the Purſuit of which has been his only Aim</hi>) and now forced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And in this Agony, He is now with the Aſſiſtance of this his ſpiritual Friend to prepare for <hi>Death.</hi>

            <p>But is this a fit Time for it, when he is juſt going to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? When Fear and Trouble has weakened his Reaſon, how can he go about ſo great a Work?</p>
            <p>A Work that requires the greateſt Leiſure, Application, and Tranquility of Mind that is poſſible, and for which all the Saints have ever thought their whole Lives too ſhort, and this ſick Man has it now all upon his Hands to diſpatch on a ſudden in a Hurry, and in a few Hours:</p>

            <p>But let us conſider a little farther, what paſſes between this dying Perſon and his ſpiritual Friend.</p>
            <p>He now ſpeaks not his own Sentiments, but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats what the Clergy-man puts in his Mouth, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps what he ſays, or what he ought to ſay.</p>
            <p>The Merits and Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, which in this laſt Hour is the great Conſolation of a Good Man on a Death-Bed, now only ſerves to ubraid this Sinner.</p>
            <p>With whom then ſhall he now find Eaſe?</p>
            <p>His Friends and Relations retire, leaving him and the Clergy-man by themſelves for a while alone.</p>
            <p>Conſider now what Thoughts this diſtreſſed Perſon will have, when the Divine only ſtays to exhort him to fix his Eyes on Jeſus Chriſt crucified, and to inform him, that being now paſt all Hopes of Recovery, and bereft of all Creatures, Jeſus Chriſt alone muſt be his only Refuge and Conſolation.—Jeſus Chriſt crucified muſt be now, Dear Brother <hi>(ſays the Divine)</hi> your only Hope, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You muſt ſeek Strength in his Death, againſt the Fear of your's: Place then your Confidence in this comfortable Object, in the Thoughts of which I leave you to your ſelf: And the Clergy-man withdraws for a while.</p>
            <p>This is the End of all thoſe ſhameful Pleaſures, which Luſtful Perſons with ſo much Greedineſs purſue.</p>
            <p>Did it ever enter into ſuch a Perſon's Thoughts on his Death-bed, to regret that he had not in his Life pleaſed himſelf, and gratified his brutiſh craving <hi>Paſſios</hi> more?</p>
            <p>Every dying Perſon will repent his having pleaſed him ſelf too much, but never that he did not more.</p>
            <p>But alaſs, there is now no more World for him; he has acted <hi>His</hi> Part on the Stage of it, and muſt now (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his unwillingneſs) go off from it.</p>
            <p>And as Actors go off a Stage with Applauſe, more or leſs according to the Merits of their Performance; ſo this dying Man goes off the Stage of this Life loaded with his Self-Defilements and Impurities, as our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our foretold of impenitent Chriſtians. <hi>John</hi> chap. 8. v. 21. That <hi>they ſhall die in their Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0208500301:33"/>
            <p>What Comfort will this Perſon find now in thinking of Jeſus Chriſt, who has during his Life had ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to him? Whilſt in Health, how often has he perhaps made a Jeſt of the great Truths of Chriſtian Religion? And now he muſt, notwithſtanding all his <hi>Rallery,</hi> in a few Hours appear before the great Founder of it.</p>
            <p>The Divine viſits him again and prays by him, and ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord ſave this thy Servant:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the dying Perſon anſwers if he can, tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps very faintly and with trembling and ſtammering <hi>Lips:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which—put—his—Truſt—in—thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He utters this indeed with his trembling Lips, but his <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> do ſo cloud his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that he ſcarce has Liberty to uſe it, and by conſequence ſcarce knows what he ſays—Next: What Terror muſt it be to him to hear the Clergy-man go on with thoſe Words?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We commend the Soul of this thy Servant into thy Hands, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c.—To him who loved his Pleaſures and the World ſo much as he has done:</p>
            <p>Nay who perhaps never loved any Thing elſe but his Pleaſures, and never made <hi>One</hi> ſerious real Step towards <hi>Heaven</hi> in all his Life.—Again: What a Terror muſt; thoſe Words give him,—<hi>Go Chriſtian Soul out of this World:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Profciſcere Ammo Chriſtiana de hoc Mundo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is no more for you to do in it:</p>
            <p>You muſt leave it; but How? And Why?</p>
            <p>By Force: And becauſe your Pleaſures leave you, and not you them.—St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking to you in this Condition tells you, <hi>Serm.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Non vis relinquere Mundum, relinquet te Mundus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are unwilling to leave the World and your Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but that's nothing, the World will now leave you:</p>
            <p>There is no avoiding it, a Dying Perſon cannot help it:</p>
            <p>There is no Appeal.—You MUST go Chriſtian Soul out of this World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You muſt leave it,—But</p>
            <p>The <hi>Divine</hi> goes on: <hi>Accept O Lord his Tears,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What Tears?—Alaſs! Tears and Sorrow from his unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to Die, and leave the World and his Pleaſures, and becauſe he can enjoy them no longer: Nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>Lord! In what a Condition is this dying Man?</p>
            <p>If he has yet his Senſes left, the Remembrance of his paſt Actions rifle his very Soul, and tear him to peeces.</p>
            <p>The ſhameful Action now leaves him, being no more capable of it, and not he the Action.</p>
            <p>O Death! How terrible is thy Memory to this poor Wretch, thus drown'd and, abſorpt in his own Guilt?</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Some farther Conſiderations of the Condition of this <hi>ONANIAN</hi> on his Dying-Bed.</head>
            <p>THis almoſt Diſtracted SENSUALIST being now upon the brink of having his <hi>Eternal Doom</hi> decided, his paſt Actions tear him with inexpreſſible Remorſe.</p>
            <p>Every one of his paſt <hi>Defilements</hi> appears now to him as big as a <hi>Mountain,</hi> and in all its Deformity and ghaſtly Shape, which before he cheated himſelf in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of, by the deceiving Name of <hi>Weakneſs and Frailty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How diſmal muſt the Apprchenſions of this dying LEACHER be, when he reflects that he has now but a few Hours more to live, and if not ſincerely reconciled to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> by a true <hi>Repentance,</hi> is for ever loſt?</p>
            <p>What muſt this Sinner do at this dreadful Hour?</p>
            <p>In which St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that the very Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not ſecure, 1 Epiſtle Ch. 4. v. 18. <hi>If the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous ſcarcely are ſaved, where ſhall the wicked appear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this terrible Extremity, ALL that he has ever in his Life Time heard of <hi>Judgment,</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and other awakening Truths of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> comes now all on a ſudden freſh into his Mind, and fright him.</p>
            <p>And 'tis wonderful that he, who ſome few Days ago was ſo full of <hi>Doubts,</hi> and <hi>Uncertainties</hi> as to <hi>Religion,</hi> and who made almoſt a Jeſt of <hi>Chriſtanity,</hi> and the Purity of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and would believe SO LITTLE, ſhould now be ſo fully convinced of theſe Truths, and all on a ſudden believe SO MUCH: For no People in the World believe more, or have ſtronger Faith than <hi>Dying Men:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what does this convincing Faith avail an impenitent <hi>Onanian</hi> then? The Devils believe as much as any Chriſtians:</p>
            <p>But as St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, 2.19. their Faith only, ſerves to make them tremble. <hi>Doemones credunt &amp; contrennſcunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And juſt in the ſame Caſe is this Perſon on a <hi>Dying-bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What lie was ſo unwilling to believe all his Life Time, he cannot help believing now: So that a Death-Bed will give him a lively Faith, when nothing elſe will.</p>
            <p>This Perſon whilſt he was well and in Health, made nothing of ridiculeing <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let him now carry on the Jeſt with his Wit and Rallery if he can. No, No, A. Death-Bed teaches a true Leſſon, convinces the moſt obſtinate, and opens their Eyes.</p>

            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0208500301:35"/>
            <p>If ever a Man's Judgment is impartial, 'twill be on a Death-Bed. Then the Mind is fill'd with cruel Remorſe, the <hi>Conſcience</hi> is terribly awaken'd, paſt <hi>Defilements</hi> come freſh in to the Mind, and ſeizes it with inexpreſſible Conſternation:</p>
            <p>And 'tis then, that every <hi>Senſualiſt</hi> will begin to open their Eyes, and to judge of things after quite another Manner than ever they did before, and would give <hi>All the whole World,</hi> were it at their Diſpoſal, that they could now call their paſt Actions back again.</p>
            <p>Now Terror and Remorſe begin to ſhew themſelves, and the dying Man is ſeized with inexpreſſible Anguiſh.</p>
            <p>Now he would <hi>forſake</hi> his Sin: Now he <hi>condemns</hi> himſelf:</p>
            <p>Now he is willing to open his Caſe to his ſpiritual Friend, who before could never be brought to it.</p>
            <p>But alaſs! It is now too late, he has no more Time left, He is a Dying: — He is now of no more uſe to the World, nor it to him. He may with good Reaſon cry out</p>
            <q>
               <l>NOW my Soul the Day is gone,</l>
               <l>Which in the Morn was thine,</l>
               <l>Now it's Glaſs no more ſhall run,</l>
               <l>It's Sun no longer ſhine.</l>
               <l>True alaſs! the Day is gone,</l>
               <l>O we it only ſo:</l>
               <l>But it is loſt as well as done,</l>
               <l>To my eternal Woe.</l>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Auſt. Dev.</hi>
               </bibl>
            </q>
            <p>The Example of the good Thelf's <hi>Repentance</hi> has very little room here to encourage any Delay to ſuch Perſons of their Converſion. Becauſe as St. <hi>Aug.</hi> juſtly ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scripture comfortably furniſhes us with this Example of</hi> ONE <hi>True Death Bed Repentance, that we may not</hi> Deſpair.</p>
            <p>But alaſs! it is the only ONE throughout the whole Scripture, that we may not <hi>Preſume,</hi> and to convince us, what a Height of Folly <hi>(not to ſay Madneſs)</hi> it is, and how extremely dangerous to live in the habitual commiſſion of this abominable Sin with any ſuch ill grounded Hopes.</p>
            <p>So that whatever Perſon does ſo, moſt miſerably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes upon, and abominably CHEATS himſelf at laſt, with only an Appearance of Converſion and Repentance.</p>
            <p>If therefore any deluded <hi>Senſualiſts</hi> find themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take any Encouragement in remaining in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of this deteſtable Vice, from the Example of thoſe <hi>ſo very Few,</hi> who have riſen again, and ſincerely and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repented, after terrible Falls;</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0208500301:36"/>
            <p>Let ſuch know, that they have much more Reaſon to tremble at the Remembrance of infinite <hi>Numbers</hi> of others who have fallen in like Manner, and never did riſe, but have been utterly undone by it, and eternally loſt.</p>
            <p>If a Perſon could die Twice, an unprepared Firſt Death might be repaired by a Second: But he can die but ONCE, and an Eternity of Happineſs or Miſery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon this ONCE. And being once only ill done is for ever ill done, and never can be repaired.</p>
            <p>Any One then who goes on in his Sin, with the Deſign of Repenting on a Death-bed; puts it off to a <hi>Time,</hi> the moſt unfit for it of all his whole Life, and which (is to be feared) will prove no Time at all for him.</p>
            <p>If a good Death conſiſted only in a few Tears, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a few Friends to pray by one, in having the Aſſiſtance of a Divine, in a Remorſe of Conſcience, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to amend, and even in receiving the Holy Sacrament, this Perſon's Madneſs would not be near ſo great:</p>
            <p>But alaſs! How many daily die with all theſe VERY SAME Helps, and many more, and yet Die miſerably, and are now irreparably loſt for all eternity?</p>
            <p>And could but any of them return upon Earth, to tell us how all this came to paſs, and could poſſibly be with ſo many Helps; their Anſwer would be, that they died miſerably, becauſe they did not prepare before hand, by quitting this Sin in Time when they might.</p>
            <p>They would alſo tell us, that thoſe Helps they had on their Death Beds, were only <hi>Opera Operata,</hi> meer <hi>outward Works,</hi> which to them were of no Effect, for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite <hi>Inward</hi> Diſpoſtions, and a real Converſion of the Heart, and a leaving off this abominable Sin whilſt they were in Health: Whereas their profeſſing with their Lips outwardly to deteſt, renounce, and leave this Sin now at a Time, when the Sin leaves them, deſerves no manner of Thanks to them at all for it.</p>
            <p>And that this is evidently true, fully appears from thoſe who do by a ſingular Mercy of Almighty God, recover from great Fits of Sickneſſes, after, all imaginable Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations whilſt they were Sick, of mending their Lives in Caſe of Recovery: But when recovered, think no more on't, but return again <hi>(like a Dog to his Vomit)</hi> to their old Ways. Which is a convincing Proof, how little Death-Bed Proteſtations and Deſigns are to be depended on.</p>
            <p>So that 'tis not having a Sorrow upon a Death-Bed, that is merely enough, Numbers having gone oat of this World perfectly bathed in Tears, and in appearance Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, and yet have been eternally loſt:</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0208500301:37"/>
            <p>And the Reaſon of this has been, becauſe their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was for leaving the World, and all they loved in it, and nor for having offended <hi>Almighty God.</hi>—Again:</p>
            <p>How can any One imagin that he ſhall be able up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Death-Bed to hate what he has all his Life time ſo loved, ſo doated upon, and ſo eagerly purſued?</p>
            <p>And yet every Dying Perſon that does not truly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate his darling and beloved Sin above any Thing in the World, and this for the Love of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> who is highly offended thereby, will be eternally loſt.</p>
            <p>This is as true, as that he has committed the Sin, which when once committed, the Delinquent is always <hi>Certain</hi> of, but entirely <hi>Uncertain</hi> of the Pardon of it.</p>
            <p>Will it be eaſy for this Man, now all on a ſudden to deteſt and abhor what he has always ſo much loved, and who perhaps never made ſo much as one ſerious Act of Repentance for it, in his <hi>whole Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will it be eaſy for One who has doated on this Sin all his Life, now to abhor it, becauſe Death tears him from it, and becauſe he now is no more able to commit it.</p>
            <p>No No: Deceive not your ſelf, every <hi>Onanian,</hi> whoever you are that reads this Book: This will <hi>One Day</hi> be your own Caſe really and in Fact, as now it is in Imagination.</p>
            <p>Oh! the miſerable State, will ſuch a One ſay to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whereto I find my ſelf now reduced! Oh! that whilſt I was in Health, I had left off this Sin!</p>
            <p>But I have brought my ſelf now (by continuing in it) to that Paſs, that I am (morally ſpeaking) unable to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for it. And now after all, I am come to my Laſt Day, I am laid upon that Bed, from whence I ſhall riſe no more, but muſt go to appear before my God loaded and defiled with theſe my repeated Crimes.</p>
            <p>Conſider again, what long and languiſhing Farewells your Soul will give to her Body and this World.</p>
            <p>She will then take her Leave of all thoſe paſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Actions ſhe has ſo long been enſlaved to, together with an eternal Farewell to Riches, Vanities, Company, Pleaſures, Paſtimes, Friends, Neighbours, Kindred, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Husband, Wife, and in ſine to every Creature, and at laſt even to her own Body, which ſhe is now about to leave Pale, Hideous, and Loathſome.</p>
            <p>And thus the poor <hi>Onanian</hi> expires, and becomes a mournful, but indeed a very moving Sight to deter Luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſons, from the Commiſſion of thoſe Unnatural Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have now given ſo much Trouble to this poor deceaſed Wretch's Soul at preſent, and render'd his Doom ſo uncertain for the future.</p>

            <p>THis SENSUALIST being after all now dead, altho <hi>Reſore,</hi> the moſt accompliſhed and beautiful Perſon in the World, now inſpires nothing but Horror:</p>
            <p>Immediately ALL is ſilent, the Corps is covered, the Curtains are drawn, and every one retires, with a (faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they go) <hi>Lord have Mercy upon his Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the uſual COMPLIMENT now made him is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is gone poor Man:</hi> HE WAS NO BOBY'S ENEMY BUT HIS OWN. <hi>God's Peace be with him,</hi> they will ſay: and that's all: He is gone after all his Pleaſure, and has carried all his Actions (for his Paſport) along with him:</p>
            <p>And the Beſt they can ſay is, <hi>We hope he has made his Peace with God,</hi> &amp;c. Oh Peace! How uncertain and doubt ful art thou to this poor Wretch, that never perhaps thought of thee, 'till reduced to a Dying-Bed?</p>
            <p>Where is now the Beauty, the Galantry, and good Mien of this Perſon? What is become of all his Pleaſures?</p>
            <p>But above all, what is become of his Soul?</p>
            <p>Alaſs! of this we have all the Reaſon in the World, from his foregoing Conduct, to apprehend but badly.</p>
            <p>What now becomes of this Body ſo often defiled?</p>
            <p>It begins already to grow offenſive and burdenſome.</p>
            <p>So that notwithſtanding all its former Charms and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, every Body now flies it, <hi>Nor would any one now lie but one only Night alone in a Bed with it, on any Account whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Husband, Wife, Children, Relations, Friends, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Servants are all in a hurry to get rid of it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who loved it beſt, are now moſt deſirous to have it convey'd away, and put out of Sight:</p>
            <p>They All make haſt to Nail it up, and put it into the Ground, and ſo get rid of it: And <hi>Would not for any thing, ſo much as only Look at it, a few Weeks after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus this Perſon is forgot almoſt as ſoon as gone, every one returns to his Buſineſs, your Friends ſeek other Friends, take new Meaſures, and hardly think any more of you.</p>
            <p>They concern themſelves no more about you, than if you had never been, they often undo all you had done, and in a little Time you are no more talked off.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0208500301:39"/>
            <p>All the Pleaſures of this <hi>Senſualiſt</hi> thus end in a Shroud, a Coffin, the Grave, Worms, Rottenneſs, and Corruption:</p>
            <p>But the immortal Soul of this ſo often defiled Body is gone into a new Region and amongſt new Company, to be Judged and have its definitive Sentence paſted upon it; either to go to the Right-hand, or to the Left:</p>
            <p>Alaſs! whither ſhall yours go? What Way ſhall it take?</p>
            <p>No other than that which it has begun here in this World.—The Sentence paſſed on unrepenting <hi>Onanians</hi> is this, <hi>Go ye Curſed into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Math. 25.51.</p>
            <p>Ponder well every One, that reads this, theſe weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Words. Go, ſays the Judge. A Word of Eternal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from Happineſs.</p>
            <p>He calls them <hi>Curſed.</hi> O how dreadful a Curſe muſt this be? A General Curſe including all Woes, an Irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Curſe, comprehending all Times:</p>
            <p>The Judge adds, <hi>into Everlaſting Fire:</hi> Oh Eternity of Pains, how dreadful wilt thou be to this poor <hi>Senſualiſt,</hi> that has done little elſe but indulged himſelf in Pleaſure?</p>
            <p>Men are ſo uſed to hear Talk of Hell, that it very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affects them, whereas if every <hi>Onanian</hi> was but truly ſenſible what Hell is, he would tremble at the very thought of committing an Action, that ſo certainly <hi>Inſures</hi> it to him.</p>
            <p>In order then to make every One, that may read this Book, as ſenſible of this State of Miſery, as our groſs Conceptions, and material Compariſons can make it,</p>
            <p>Imagin that you ſee in the Center of the Earth a vaſt Gulph and Lake of Fire and Flames, and thoſe two unhappy Men <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan,</hi> together with all others who have impenitently imitated them in the Perpetration of this abominable Fact, plunged and roling in it, all cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tranſperſed with Fire, which they not only ſuck in with their Breath, but which enters alſo at their Eyes and Ears, their Mouths and Noſtrils caſting forth dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Flames, their Skin ſcorched, their Fleſh, Blood, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and Brains boiling up with the Violence of the Burning, their Bones and Marrow all tranſparent with Fire, like a Piece of Iron taken red Hot out of a Furnace, and all the Parts of their Bodies glowing with Fire.</p>
            <p>Having here put <hi>Er</hi> along with his Brother <hi>Onan,</hi> the Reader doubtleſs will deſire to know, whether or not the Crime of <hi>Er</hi> was the ſame as that of <hi>Onan,</hi> the Holy Scripture mentioning only of him, That <hi>Er Judah</hi>'s <hi>Firſt Born was wicked in the Sight of the Lord, and the Lord ſlew him.</hi> Gen. 38.7.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0208500301:40"/>
            <p>And afterwards <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. in the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Edition of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible, ſpeaking of the Puniſhment of <hi>Onan,</hi> ſays that <hi>The Lord ſlew him</hi> ALSO.</p>
            <p>Commentators on this Place of the Scripture all agree, that the Crime of theſe two Brothers <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame as to the Fact, but only, different as to the Motive: <hi>Er</hi> would not have his Wife <hi>Thamar</hi> bear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to preſerve her Beauty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Onan</hi> would not have her bear a Child by him, becauſe (according to the Law) it would not be called by his Name, nor eſteemed HIS. Thus St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> lib. 22. <hi>contra Eauſtum,</hi> cap. 84. <hi>Conſentiunt Hebraei &amp; Chriſtiani tam</hi> Er <hi>quam</hi> Onan <hi>peccaſſe eodem peccato</hi> Mollitiei, <hi>quod eſt contra natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram generationis: Sed</hi> Er <hi>fecit, ne ſcilicet Puerperia aliquid de pulchritudine ſuae Uxoris decerperet,</hi> Onan <hi>vero ex alio motivo, ut ex Scripturâ patet.</hi>—But to return to our Subject.</p>
            <p>How glad would theſe two unhappy Men be to ſuffer only from <hi>Our</hi> Fire? But alaſs there is no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it, and the Fire of Hell.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> compares <hi>Our</hi> Fire to it, as only a painted Fire. Our Fire is lightſome, their's is dark and horrible.</p>
            <p>Ours is the Effect of the Goodneſs, and Bounty of God, their's is the Product of his incenſed Omnipotence.</p>
            <p>Again: Repreſent to your ſelf a Man tormented with the Gout, or ſome other violent Pain.</p>
            <p>What Torment does he feel? How does he cry out?</p>
            <p>How willingly would he die to put an End to his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And yet he ſuffers only in ſome ONE Part of his Body: He has the Liberty of complaining, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſeeing himſelf pittied.</p>
            <p>But what would he undergo, if every Member and Part of his Body ſuffered the ſame Torment?</p>
            <p>And if inſtead of helping and pittying him, every Stander-by ſhould abuſe and upbraid him without any Liberty of Complaining?</p>
            <p>In Hell, the Damn'd do not only ſuffer the Pains to which we are ſubject in this Life, they ſuffer all theſe and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more, their Torments are univerſal, violent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, and unſupportable, and yet they MUST and do in every Inſtant of Time feel them ALL, and in the Midſt of them ALL, they cannot receive, or even ſo much as hope for any Reſpite, Eaſe, or Comfort.</p>
            <p>What would only ONE poor ſingle Drop of Water be againſt ſuch a Sea and Torrent of Flames? And yet ſuch a poor Refreſhment, ſuch a meer <hi>Nothing</hi> is and ever will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0208500301:41"/>
            <p>The Sick find ſome Eaſe in tumbling and removing from one Place to another, but unhappy <hi>Onan</hi> together with his Brother <hi>Er,</hi> and their Followers, are now at this Time that <hi>You</hi> read this, in this Fire immovable as at Rock.</p>
            <p>But all this is the leaſt Part of their Suffering; for notwithſtanding all theſe Torments are ſo exceſſive, yet it would be an inexpreſſible Comfort to them, if they were but ever to have an End: But what adds infinitely to their Miſeries, is their Knowledge that all theſe Torments will be for all Eternity, and never are to have an End.</p>
            <p>So that notwithſtanding all their Horror, there is no Manner of Hopes that they will ever end, or diminiſh.</p>
            <p>What are now the Thoughts of thoſe two miſerable Men <hi>Onan,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Er?</hi> Who have now been in all theſe Torments almoſt <hi>Four Thouſand Years,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe two young Men were cut off by Alm. God for theſe Wickedneſſes in the Prime of their Youths, about the Year of the World <hi>Two Thouſand twenty nine,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Er</hi> nor <hi>Onan</hi> being 20 Years old when this happened to them, and therefore ought to be a particular Example to all young Perſons: And they know that they are no nearer to the End of their Sufferings, than they were the very firſt Moment they began them.</p>
            <p>Was miſerable <hi>Onan</hi> together with his Brother <hi>Er,</hi> oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fill only the Hollow of a Man's Hand with each of their Tears, and each of them to drop but ONE ſingle Tear at the End of every Thouſand Years: What a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duration would this be? <hi>Onan</hi> would have now ſhed but <hi>Three</hi> Tears towards it; and his unhappy Brother <hi>Er</hi> juſt as many: But if each of them were obliged at the ſame Rate of <hi>One ſingle Tear for every Thouſand Years</hi> to make a Brook or a River with their Tears, or even to fill the Sea, what a prodigious Length of Time would this require? Our Imaginations are Loſt and confounded, our Thoughts are ſtun'd in ſo vaſt a Duration.</p>
            <p>And yet all this great and inconceivable Extent of Time is nothing to Eternity, and that Duration which theſe unhappy Wretches are to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>A Time WILL come when <hi>Onan</hi> and every one of his Imitators will be able to ſay, that <hi>One Tear for every Thouſand Years</hi> that I have been in Hell would have been equal to the Sea, would have drown'd the World, and would have fill'd up the immence Space between Heaven and Earth, and yet I am to begin again, to ſhed the ſame Quantity of Tears over, and over, and ever again; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Eternity of Torments to ſuffer even Millions of Ages after the World ſhall be ended.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0208500301:42"/>
            <p>So that there WILL be a Time when <hi>Onan</hi> himſelf will be able to ſay, that having <hi>Already</hi> ſhed as many Tears at the Rate of <hi>One only ſingle Tear for every Thouſand Years,</hi> as would fill the whole Sea, as many times over again, as there are (in all the Fields and Meadows in the World, and throughout the whole Univerſe) <hi>Blades of Graſs and Corn in the Fields, Leaves on the Trees, Grains of Sand in the Sea, and upon its Shore, and Stars in the Firmament,</hi> yet I am now after all this to begin my Work over and over again.</p>
            <p>The ſame alſo WILL one Day every <hi>Onanian</hi> be able (as well as <hi>Onan</hi> himſelf) with inconceivable Regret to ſay. And all this for a baſe Pleaſure of only a Moment.</p>
            <p>Our Imagination is perfectly Loſt, and our Thoughts are ſwallowed up, ſtun'd and confounded, in the View of ſuch a vaſt extent of Duration, inſomuch that after Millions of Ages as many Times multiplied, unhappy <hi>Onan</hi> will ſtill have his Work to begin, over again, as freſh and as much A new, as the very firſt Moment he entered there, and every Onanian the ſame.</p>
            <p>O DREADFUL! OH INCOMPREHENSIBLE ETERNITY!</p>
            <p>Was <hi>Onan</hi> to burn only as many Millions of Ages, as there have paſſed Minutes ſince the Creation of the World, which is now <hi>Five Thouſand Seven Hundned, and Seventy odd,</hi> Years ago, his Pains would at leaſt one Time have an End, but he knows his Torments will NEVER end.</p>
            <p>When every One that is in <hi>Hell</hi> reflects on this and compares it with the inconſiderable Time his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for which he is condemn'd, laſted when he was in this World, what muſt his Rage be?</p>
            <p>Where are now thoſe great Men, who have for paſt Ages enjoyed all this World could give them?</p>
            <p>What are they the better for all their Senſuality, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, and Pleaſure, if they are Damned?</p>
            <p>All Pleaſure is now paſt and gone, as if it had never been, but the Soul will FOR EVER BE, and that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably too, if not prevented by a true Repentance.</p>
            <p>If theſe Reflections make no Impreſſion upon an <hi>Onanian</hi> that reads this; if this Eternity does not touch him, can he call himſelf a rational Creature?</p>
            <p>But to repreſent to the Reader in Epitome all theſe awakening Truths <hi>together,</hi> nothing is more proper, than a Verſion (<hi>Mutatis Mutandis,</hi> for the Exigency of, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to our preſent Subject) of a certain celebrated <hi>Latin</hi> Hymn on the terrible Day of Judgment, begining <hi>Dies Irae dies illa,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> What the uſual Misfortune is that attends the Sin of Self-Defilement: And how to remedy it.</head>
            <p>THE common ill Effect the Habit of this Vice of <hi>Self-Defilement</hi> has on the Body, is to bring Perſons of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex inſenſibly into a Gleet, or other ſuch draining Weakneſſes as hereafter will be ſhewn:</p>
            <p>Which Diſorders are the Fore-runners of various Pains, Aches, and other Ailments about the Body, waſts the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, decays the Strength, cauſes particular Pains, and Dizzyneſs in the Head, and ſo wears out the Body, as to bring it in the End into a Conſumption.</p>
            <p>And what alſo is to be much lamented is, that theſe Ailments are of ſuch an <hi>Out of the Way</hi> kind from common Diſtempers (to ſay nothing of the Shame that attends them, which uſually keeps Perſons from diſcovering their Condition to another in order to obtain a Cure) that the beſt Phyſicians are oftentimes puzled with them.</p>
            <p>And for theſe Reaſons it is, that ſo many unhappy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are daily ruined, and their Conſtitutions utterly Broke and ſpoiled by theſe Sort of Gleets and Weakneſſes, cauſed by this wretched Sin of <hi>Self-Defilement,</hi> for want of the right and proper Method of curing them.</p>
            <p>As then a great many Perſons will doubtleſs read this Book in Hopes of Relief from it, the next thing to be conſidered ſhall be, of the moſt rational Method of Cure, according to the Principles of Anatomy and Phyſick, of theſe Gleets and draining Weakneſſes in either Sex, conſequent from, and cauſed by a Habit of this Vice.</p>
            <p>And which cannot fail of being very acceptable to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader labouring under them, becauſe, there is no Treatiſe hitherto extant, that has ſo treated of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to aſſiſt Perſons ſatisfactorily in their Cure.</p>
            <p>But as to be able to cure a Diſtemper, there muſt be a perfect Knowledge had of its Cauſe (or elſe 'tis only gueſs Work, and acting in the Dark) <gap reason="foreign">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment or Diſtemper, is the moſt likely Perſon Beſt to cure it,</hi> which made that great Phyſician <hi>Celſus</hi> afterwards ſay, That <hi>Recte curaturum quem prima Origo cauſoe non fefellerit.</hi>

            <p>Therefore, in order to explicate how it comes to paſs that a Gleet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is thus ſo <hi>Uſually</hi> cauſed by this Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Vice, and thereby be led into the trueſt Method of its Cure, and prevent the Ruin of Numbers of Perſons and their Families, whom this wretched Sin of <hi>Self-Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> has been the Bane of, it will firſt of all be abſolutely neceſſary to examine into the Anatomy of that particular Part of the Body where theſe Gleets are ſituated.

            <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Whether or no theſe Effects are ſuch as Perſons addicted to this Vice, find in themſelves, who have by it brought ſuch a Gleet, or Weakneſs upon them.</p>
            <p>Which Obſervations being premiſed, we ſhall afterwards enquire how it happens that ſuch a <hi>Change</hi> of State of theſe mucous Glands, <hi>viz.</hi> from an elaſtick, ſpringy, and ſtrong State, to a limber, looſe, and flaccid one, can produce, and be the Cauſe of that Quantity of Matter which drips and comes away in the Courſe of a <hi>Gleet,</hi> cauſed by the vicious habit of this Sin of Self-Defilement.</p>
            <p>Or in other Terms, (but the Meaning is ſtill the ſame) Whether or no, the productive Cauſe of a <hi>Gleet, ie.</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the Orifices or Mouths of the mucous Glands in the Urethra, can ſo far increaſe the Quantity of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor naturally produced by theſe Glands, as to be ſuch as is experienced by Perſons who have a Gleet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>Hence the Motive of proceeding thus with our preſent Subject is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the great Inconvenience that Perſons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with a Gleet lie under, from the Quantities of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick exhibited to them for their Cure, which even it ſelf is a Diſeaſe, and often ſerves for little elſe than break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſound Conſtitution, or making a bad one worſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The great Uneaſyneſs (notwithſtanding a daily Change of Linnen) which ſuch Perſons harraſs'd thus with a Gleet, or other ſuch Weakneſs, oftentimes for a long while labour under, by Reaſon of ſuch a Dripping conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually upon them: And which tho for the preſent may give no other Trouble, than as it is oppoſite to Cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (being no pleaſant Companion to a clean neat Perſon) yet will in Time impair and break the beſt of Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and moſt certainly bring on a Conſumption, being a conſtant Drain and Waſt of the Animal Spirits, as in the Second Volume will be clearly ſhewed.</p>

            <p>BY a <hi>Gleet,</hi> or other ſuch draining Weakneſs, which <hi>Onanians</hi> have by their wicked Practice drawn upon themſelves, is here underſtood an <hi>Involuntary</hi> and almoſt conſtant Efflux or <hi>Dripping</hi> away of Matter from a human Body, and that in much the ſame Quantity, whether the Perſon be aſleep or awake, this Gleet being of juſt the ſame Kind as any other Gleet following any ill Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, ſuch as the <hi>Secret Diſeaſe</hi> and its Cure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>And then to examin, if there is naturally any Liquor ſeparated in that Part, capable of becoming the Matter of that Epidemical Weakneſs and common Companion of Perſons habituated to this Vice, uſually called a <hi>Gleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſervable by Anatomy, that in the Nervo-Spongi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subſtance of the Urethra or Urinary Paſſage, there are ſeveral Glandulous Openings, like ſo many little Pin-holes, firſt diſcovered by that great Anatomiſt Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> which ſerve as ſo many excretory Ducts or Channels deſigned by Nature conſtantly to convey and furniſh a certain viſcid, clammy, mucous Kind of Liquor or Moiſture into the Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſſage; the Uſe of which Liquor is to lubricate and beſmear by its Viſcidity the Pipe or Paſſage, and thereby to preſerve and defend it from being fretted and corroded by the ſharp Salts of the Urine which is daily paſſing thro it, and which, without this defenſative Liquor would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be fretted, and become raw, and by conſequence,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0208500301:48"/>Sore as any fleſhy Part would be, that ſhould have ſuch a ſalt ſharp fretting Liquor as Urine ſo often paſſing over it, unleſs it were preſerved by ſome ſuch proper Defenſative, as the continual anointing or beſmearing it with ſome ſuch ſmooth, ſoft, unctuous Subſtance would be:</p>
            <p>Inſomuch that were it not for this Slimy Liquor or Moiſture that Nature is continually ſupplying the Urinary Paſſage with, by means of thoſe glandulous Openings juſt now mentioned, to keep it thus moiſt, it wou'd in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Time become ſo fretted and raw, by the Sharpneſs of the Urine daily paſſing thro' it, that <hi>All Mankind in general would have a perpetual Scalding and Heat of Urine upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which is not here meant, that the Urine in it ſelf would be hotter in that Suppoſition, than it is now, but that the Paſſage being raw and ſore for want of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſative ſlimy Moiſture which now protects it, it would be fretted by the Saltneſs of the Urine, and ſo would ſmart, and ſeem as it were to Burn and Scald, whenever the Urine paſſed through it: Juſt as any other raw ſore Place diveſted of its Scarf-Skin, wou'd ſmart and ſeem to burn, if one ſhou'd throw Urine or ſalt Water upon it.</p>
            <p>This being thus eſtabliſhed from the nice <hi>Anatomical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection</hi> of the inward <hi>Structure</hi> and <hi>Make</hi> of the Urethra,</p>
            <p>We are next to conſider what Changes and Alterations theſe glandulous Openings in the Paſſage, are ſubject to, and capable of: And then, whether or no ſuch <hi>Changes</hi> can furniſh us with ſuch a large Supply of Matter as is experienced <hi>Involuntarily</hi> to drip away from Perſons who have that Weakneſs commonly called a <hi>Gleet</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>Our next Endeavour then muſt be to examin How the Urethra only and the glandulous Openings above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd which it contains, are able to furniſh ſo great a Quantity of Matter, as is obſerv'd to be <hi>involuntarily</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in the Courſe of any Sore of <hi>Gleet.</hi>

            <p>By which is meant, that the Openings of theſe Glands, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>otwithſtanding their being ſo very ſmall, have a certain Springineſs and Elaſticity proportionable to their Bigneſs,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0208500301:49"/>and Size, belonging to them, by which they are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a certain Power of ſtraitning, contracting, and drawing themſelves together, more or leſs, upon every Emiſſion of that abovementioned Moiſture Nature deſigns them to ſupply the Urethra with: Juſt as the Sphincter Muſcle of the Bladder is endowed with a Power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, holding, and keeping in the Urine.</p>
            <p>And by this Means it is, that ſo much and no more of this Moiſture is thrown out of theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lands into the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra, than is juſt neceſſary for the lubricating and moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, preparatively for the Paſſage of the Urine.</p>
            <p>So that as by reaſon of the Strength and Vigour of the Sphincter-Muſcle, for Example of the Bladder, the Neck and Mouth of it is endowed with a Power of ſtraitening, contracting and cloſing it ſelf together after every Emiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Urine, every one experiences in themſelves a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of either Holding, or letting go their Water:</p>
            <p>So, much in the ſame manner, by Reaſon of the Strength and Vigour of the Orifices of theſe Glandules, they are endowed with a not unlike Power of ſtraitening, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, and drawing themſelves together (which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is deſired always to ſuppoſe to be in a Degree propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to their Bigneſs) after every Emiſſion of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous ſlimy Liquor they contain:</p>
            <p>Which Strength being once loſt, the Power of retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and keeping in this Liquor is alſo loſt with it</p>
            <p>The State then and Condition of theſe glandulous Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (or as Dr. <hi>Drake</hi> calls them, <hi>Mucous Glands,</hi> from their thus furniſhing and ſupplying the Paſſage with this <hi>Mucous</hi> ſlimy Liquor,) being thus conſidered in healthy Perſons.</p>
            <p>Our next Enquiry muſt be into the State of them in Perſons afflicted with a <hi>Gleet,</hi> or other ſuch draining <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> after a vicious Habit of this Sin, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Which State we ſhall ſoon be appriſed of, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that when a Perſon has been addicted to this Vice, by a frequent Preſſure upon, and a violent, and <hi>Unnatural Uſe,</hi> Forcing, and Irritation of theſe Glands, by the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Act of this Sin, this <hi>Unnatural Forcing</hi> Practice has render'd them flaccid, limber, weak, and looſe, which before were healthy, vigorous, ſpringy, and ſtrong.</p>
            <p>The Truth of theſe Aſſertions) abſtracting from the Reaſonableneſs they carry along with them) will appear by giving an Account of the State of theſe Glands as they have been obſerved in ſome Anatomical Diſſections made of that particular Part, where all <hi>Gleets</hi> are ſeated that is, the Urethra or Urinary Paſſage.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0208500301:50"/>
            <p>That great Anatomiſt Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> tells us, that to inform himſelf the better in this Point, he diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ected the Urinary Paſſage of ſeveral Criminals: Some of which were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſound Perſons: The others were executed with <hi>Gleets</hi> upon 'em, having been luſtful libidinous wicked <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the healthy found Perſons he found theſe glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Openings</hi> to be ſo firm, as to have had <hi>even</hi> a perfect Elaſticity, or Springineſs belonging to them:</p>
            <p>Inſomuch that upon preſſing them, <hi>(but not without this Preſſure)</hi> he ſays, they diſcharg'd a certain Quantity of tranſparent viſcous ſlimy Liquor, ſuch as it ſhews it ſelf, and ought to be in <hi>ſtatu ſano;</hi> whereas if theſe Glands had not had ſuch a Firmneſs and Strength, in which conſiſted their Power of retaining or letting go the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid ſlimy Liquor they contain; this Liquor would have ſlipped out of them without any ſuch Preſſure at all:</p>
            <p>And by conſequence, its not owzing out, but upon ſuch a Preſſure, was an evident Mark of their Springineſs and Strength. He alſo obſerv'd the whole Urethra to be beſmeared and lined with a viſcous, ſlimy, unctuous Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, which was diſcharged from theſe <hi>Glaudulous</hi> Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or little Bags in order to lubricate the Paſſage.</p>
            <p>But in the Urethra of thoſe Criminals executed with a <hi>Gleet</hi> upon them, the Caſe was quite different:</p>
            <p>He obſerved the mucous <hi>Glands</hi> all along the <hi>Urinary Paſſage</hi> to be limber, flaccid, flabby, and looſe, very much ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and dilated, and their Orifices by the Help of a a nice Microſcope to be viſibly open, ſtretched, dilated, and diſtended, and thereby totally deſtitute of their Strength and Vigour; from whence he concluded, that they were alſo entirely deprived of their retentive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Springyneſs, having no Power left of contracting themſelves upon any emiſſion of that mucous ſlimy Liquor they contain, as thoſe other Glands could do in the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals that were executed in perfect Health.</p>
            <p>This will appear ſtill more clear, by an Example of Perſons who have a <hi>Diabetes</hi> upon them:</p>
            <p>For, from the Loſs of the Springineſs and Tone of the Sphincter Muſcle of the Bladder, the Neck, and mouth of it is ſo weakned and relaxed, as to be deprived of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Faculty, thro' a want of that Power of contracting and drawing it ſelf together after any Emiſſion of Urine, which healthy Perſons experience in themſelves:</p>
            <p>From whence it follows, that the Urine comes away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily from them, being altogether deprived of both that expulſive, as well as retentive Power which healthy Perſons have.</p>

            <p>The Difficulty then that now remains, is to conceive how ſuch very ſmall Glands and their Orifices can furniſh ſuch a Quantity of Matter, as is daily experienced to flow away in ſome <hi>Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ets,</hi> and how the mucous Liquor which naturally is diſcharged our of theſe Glands into the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra in healthy Perſons, ſhould be increaſed to ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as it is in Perſons who have a Gleet.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0208500301:52"/>
            <p>To Clear this Matter, it cannot but be allow'd, that theſe mucous Glands, as little as they are, may natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharge into the Urethra for its Lubrication as much of this Liquor in one Minute as may weigh at leaſt one quarter of a Grain: This in an Hour will be 15 Grains, or a quarter of a Dram: In 24 Hours, or a Natural Day, it will amount to 6 Drams, which is 3 Quarters of an Ounce; a Quantity ſufficient in all Reaſon to give that Uneaſineſs to the Perſon, as well as Wetneſs to the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, which is uſually experienced by thoſe under die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Circumſtances of a <hi>Gleet</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>If you ask, how theſe Glands in the Urethra can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ſo great a Quantity of Fluid, in the Time of a <hi>Gleet,</hi> above what they do in their natural State.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer is, that it is manifeſt from the Animal OEconomy, that if any Gland or excretory Duct be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and deprived of its retentive Faculty, the Quantity of Liquor that it diſcharges by Reaſon of chat Weakneſs, is conſiderably augmented in Proportion to the Degree of Weakneſs with which theſe Glands or Ducts are affected:</p>
            <p>Juſt as a little Powder of <hi>Spaniſh Flies</hi> apply'd any where, by breaking thro the Texture of the Outward Scarf-Skin, does ſo weaken the Glands as ſoon to excite a Bliſter, and by its thus weakening the Glands under the Scarf-Skin, makes them diſcharge a Quantity of Matter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſly greater, than what would naturally flow away other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from that Part by inſenſible Perſpiration only.</p>
            <p>Much in the ſame Manner, the Orifices of theſe Glands being weaken'd and relax'd by the <hi>Unnatural Forcing</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Sin, have thereby loſt their retentive Faculty, and therefore cannot hold in the Liquor they contain, but lets more of it ſlip away than the mere Lubrication of the Urethra requires, and therefore it continually is diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf by that Dripping commonly called a <hi>Gleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the true Origin and Cauſe of, not only thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Gleets and Weakneſſes, which are the Conſequences of the vicious Practice of Self Defilement, but alſo of any other Gleet, are clearly explicated, without recourſe to any other Part, or Parts, that have no Manner of Claim to fall under our preſent Conſideration, as for Example the <hi>Seminal Veſſels,</hi> or the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> or the <hi>Paraſtatae</hi> which Terms will be explicated in the Second Volume.</p>
            <p>And which Parts having b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en erroneouſly thought to furniſh the Matter of a Gleet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has been the Reaſon that the Vulgar ſo commonly (tho very improperly) call almoſt every <hi>Gleet</hi> a <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> whereas they are widely different:</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0208500301:53"/>
            <p>The only Seat of a Gleet, being no other than the mere Urinary Paſſage, and not at all farther up in the Body.</p>
            <p>Whereas that Efflux of Matter that is really and truly a Gonorrhaea, comes from the Seminal Veſſels themſelves, as will be clearly ſhewed in the next Volum</p>
            <p>Hence all the Difficulties about a <hi>Gleet,</hi> or other ſuch draining Weakneſs in either Sex, whether proceeding from the vicious Habit of the odious Sin of Self-Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or from any ill Diſtemper, or its Cure (either of theſe Gleets being of the ſame Nature,) are overcome in a few Words: Its Symptoms become obvious upon a ſmall Principle ſo clear in Anatomy, as to carry not only Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence along with it, but alſo more clearly explicates all the Symptoms and Effects of it, than hitherto has been done.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gleets then being of juſt the lame Nature, and by conſequence to be cured by juſt the ſame Method, as other Gleets and Weakneſſes are, which are contracted by either a former ill Diſtemper, ſuch as the <hi>Secret Diſeaſe,</hi> and its Cure in either Sex; but more frequently in Women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hard and difficult Labours, Colds contracted in Lyings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, Wrenches, Falls, Hurts, Strains, and other ſuch inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Cauſes, as will be hereafter ſhewed.</p>
            <p>To effect a Cure of them in either Sex, every Reader is referred to that Method of Cure for Gleets and other ſuch Weakneſſes, which is treated of in the 15th Page of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Book, entituled <hi>The Practical Scheme,</hi> and which Book is <hi>Given Gratis</hi> at the three following Places, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>So that Perſons labouring under theſe Diſorders, may by this Means happily find that Relief and Recovery of their Health and Conſtitution, which perhaps they might never have the Opportunity otherwiſe of meeting with.</p>
