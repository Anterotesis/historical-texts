            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>NEITHER majeſty and elegance of form,
ſtrength of body, freedom of movement,
nor other external qualities, conſtitute the
principal dignity of animated beings. In man,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0195500104:8"/>
we prefer genius to figure, courage to ſtrength,
and ſentiment to beauty; and, therefore, we are
induced to think, that the chief excellence of an
animal conſiſts alſo of internal qualities. By
theſe he differs from an automation, riſes above
the vegetable tribes, and approaches the human
ſpecies. It is ſentiment which ennobles, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,
and gives activity to all his organs and
propenſities. Hence the perfection of an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
depends on ſentiment alone; and, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to its extent, his faculties, reſources, and
relations with the reſt of the univerſe, are aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
When his ſentiment is delicate, and
improved by education, he is then fit to aſſociate
with man, to concur with his deſigns, to aid, to
defend, and to careſs him. By a frequent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of theſe ſervices, he conciliates the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of his maſter, and, from a tyrant, converts
him into a friend and protector.</p>
               <p>The dog, independent of the beauty of his
figure, his ſtrength, vivacity, and nimbleneſs,
poſſeſſes every internal excellence which can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the regard of man. A paſſionate, and even
a ferocious and ſanguinary temper, renders the
wild dog formidable to all animals. But, in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0195500104:9"/>
domeſtic dog, theſe hoſtile diſpoſitions vaniſh,
and are ſucceeded by the ſofter ſentiments of
attachment, and the deſire of pleaſing. He runs
with chearfulneſs and alacrity to his maſter's
foot, where he lays down his courage, his
ſtrength, and his talents. He attends for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
which he is always ſolicitous to execute.
He conſults, he interrogates, he ſupplicates his
maſter. A ſingle glance of the eye is ſufficient;
for he knows the external ſigns of our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and wiſhes. Without being endowed, like
man, with the faculty of thinking, his feelings
are extremely delicate, and he has more fidelity
and ſteadineſs in his affection. He is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by ambition, by intereſted views, or by a
deſire of revenge; and he has no fear, but that
of diſpleaſing. He is all zeal, ardour, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
More apt to recal benefits than out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,
he is not diſcouraged by blows or bad
treatment, but calmly ſuffers, and ſoon forgets
them; or he remembers them only to increaſe
his attachment. Inſtead of flying, or diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
marks of reſentment, he expoſes himſelf to
torture, and licks the hand from which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the blow. To the cruelty of his maſter,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> only oppoſes complaint, patience, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>More tractable than man, and more plaint
than any other animal, the dog is not only ſoon
inſtructed, but even conforms himſelf to the
manners, movements, and habits of thoſe who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0195500104:10"/>
govern him. He aſſumes the very tone of the
family in which he lives. Like other ſervants,
he is haughty with the great, and ruſtic with
the peaſant. Always eager to obey and to pleaſe
his maſter, or his friends, he pays no attention
to ſtrangers, and furiouſly repels beggars, whom
he diſtinguiſhes by their dreſs, their voice, and
their geſtures. When the charge of a houſe or
garden is committed to him during the night,
his boldneſs increaſes, and he ſometimes becomes
perfectly ferocious. He watches, goes the
rounds, ſmells ſtrangers at a diſtance, and, if they
ſtop, or attempt to leap any barrier, he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
darts upon them, and, by barking, and other
marks of paſſion, alarms the family and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.
Equally furious againſt thieves as
againſt rapacious animals, he attacks and wounds
them, and forces from them whatever they have
been attempting to carry off: But, contented
with victory, he lies down upon the ſpoil, and
will not touch it even to ſatisfy his appetite, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting,
at the ſame time, an example of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
temperance, and fidelity.</p>
               <p>To conceive the importance of this ſpecies in
the order of Nature, let us ſuppoſe that it never
exiſted. Without the aſſiſtance of the dog, how
could man have conquered, tamed, and reduced
the other animals into ſlavery? How could he
ſtill diſcover, hunt down, and deſtroy noxious
and ſavage beaſts? For his own ſafety, and to
render him maſter of the animated world, it was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0195500104:11"/>
neceſſary to form a party among the animals
themſelves, to conciliate by careſſes thoſe which
were capable of attachment and obedience, in
order to oppoſe them to the other ſpecies. Hence
the training of the dog ſeems to have been the
firſt art invented by man; and the reſult of this
art was the conqueſt and peaceable poſſeſſion of
the earth.</p>
               <p>Moſt animals are ſuperior to man in agility,
ſwiftneſs, ſtrength, and even in courage: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has fortified and armed them better. Their
ſenſes, and particularly that of ſmelling, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
more perfect. To have brought over to
our intereſt a bold and tractable ſpecies, like that
of the dog, was to acquire new ſenſes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
The machines and inſtruments we have
invented to improve, or to extend our other
ſenſes, are not nearly ſo uſeful as thoſe preſented
to us ready made by Nature, which, by ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the defects of our ſmelling, have furniſhed
us with great and permanent reſources for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
and dominion. The dog, ever faithful to
man, will always maintain a portion of this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
he will always preſerve a degree of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
above the other animals. He reigns at
the head of a flock, and is better heard than the
voice of the ſhepherd. Safety, order, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
are the fruits of his vigilance and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
Sheep and cattle are a people ſubjected to
his management, whom he prudently conducts
and protects, and never employs force againſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0195500104:12"/>
them, but for the preſervation of peace and good
order.</p>
               <p>But in war againſt his enemies, or wild ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
he makes a full diſplay of his courage and
intelligence. Here his natural and acquired ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
are united. As ſoon as the din of arms is
heard, as ſoon as the horn, or the voice of the
hunter, gives the alarm, the dog, ſparkling with
redoubled ardour, demonſtrates his joy by the
moſt lively emotions: He announces, by his
movements and cries, his impatience for the
combat, and his paſſion for victory. Sometimes
he moves ſilently along, reconnoitres the ground,
and endeavours to diſcover and ſurpriſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
At other times, he traces the animal's
ſteps, and, by different accents, indicates the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
the ſpecies, and even the age of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive.
Puſhed, intimidated, and deſpairing of
ſafety from flight alone, the poor animal like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
exerts its faculties, and oppoſes craftineſs
to ſagacity<note n="*" place="bottom">See below, article Deer.</note>. The reſources of inſtinct are now
worthy of admiration. To make him loſe the
ſcent, the creature doubles, returns on its former
ſteps, bounds, and wiſhes to detach itſelf from the
earth; at one leap it often clears a highway, or
a hedge, and ſwims over brooks and rivers. But,
always purſued, and being unable to conceal or
annihilate its body, the animal endeavours to
ſtart another of leſs experience, and, after run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
together till the former imagines that the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0195500104:13"/>
two ſcents or traces are confounded, it then
ſuddenly ſeparates, in order to let the other fall
a victim to the deceived enemy.</p>
               <p>But the dog, by the ſuperiority he has acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from habit and education, and from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
fineneſs of his ſenſations, loſes not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his purſuit. By the acuteneſs of his ſcent,
he unravels all the windings of the labyrinth,
all the falſe routs which were intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him; and, inſtead of abandoning the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
for an indifferent animal, he redoubles his
ardour, he overtakes, attacks, ſlays, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
his thirſt and his rage in the blood of the
victim.</p>
               <p>The propenſity to hunting, or to war, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ſtrong in man as in other animals. The
whole knowledge of the Savage is confined to
fighting and hunting. All carnivorous animals,
which have weapons and ſtrength, hunt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.
The lion and the tiger, whoſe ſtrength
is ſo great as to inſure them of victory, hunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and without artifice. Wolves, foxes, and
wild dogs, hunt in packs, aſſiſt each other with
much art, and mutually ſhare in the prey. When
the natural talents of the dog have been impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by education, when he has learned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
his ardour, and to regulate his movements,
he then hunts artificially, and is always certain
of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>In deſert and depopulated countries, there are
wild dogs, which, in their manners, differ not from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0195500104:14"/>
wolves, excepting by the facility with which
they may be tamed. They unite in troops, and
attack wild boars, and bulls, and even lions and
tigers. The wild dogs of America are of the
domeſtic race, and were tranſported thither from
Europe. Some of them have been abandoned
in theſe deſerts, where they have multiplied ſo
prodigiouſly, that they ſpread over the inhabited
countries in great packs, and attack the domeſtic
cattle, and even inſult the natives, who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to diſperſe and kill them, like other fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
animals. Wild dogs, though they have
no knowledge of man, when approached with
gentleneſs, ſoon ſoften, become familiar, and
remain faithfully attached to their maſters. But
the wolf, though taken young, and brought up
in the houſe, is only gentle when a mere cub,
never loſes his taſte for prey, and ſooner or later
indulges his inclination for rapine and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The dog may be ſaid to be the only animal
whoſe fidelity is unſhaken; who always knows
his maſter, and the friends of the family; who
diſtinguiſhes a ſtranger as ſoon as he arrives;
who underſtands his own name, and the voices
of the domeſtics; who confides not in himſelf;
who calls on his loſt maſter by cries and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
who, in long journeys, which he has
travelled but once, remembers and finds out the
roads: In fine, the dog is the only animal whoſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0195500104:15"/>
natural talents are conſpicuous, and whoſe edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is always ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>Of all animals, the dog is alſo moſt ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
of impreſſions, moſt eaſily modified by
moral cauſes, and moſt ſubject to alterations oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by phyſical influence. His tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
faculties, and habits, very prodigiouſly;
and even the figure of his body is by no means
conſtant. In the ſame country, one dog differs
greatly from another; and, in different climates,
the very ſpecies ſeems to be changed. From
theſe cauſes, the number and mixture of races
are ſo great, that it is almoſt impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſe
or enumerate them. To the ſame cauſes
muſt be attributed thoſe remarkable varieties in
ſize, figure, length of muzzle, form of the head,
length and direction of the ears and tail, colour,
quantity of hair, &amp;c. In a word, nothing ſeems
to be permanent in theſe animals but their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
organization, and the faculty of procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together. As thoſe which differ moſt from
each other are capable of intermixing and of
producing fertile individuals, it is evident, that
all dogs, however diverſified, conſtitute but one
ſpecies.</p>
               <p>In this numerous variety of races, it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to inveſtigate the character of the primitive
ſtock from which they have all ſprung. How
ſhall the effects produced by the influence of
climate, food, &amp;c. be diſtinguiſhed? How ſhall
we perceive the changes introduced by the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0195500104:16"/>
mixture of different races when in a wild, or in
a domeſtic ſtate? In the progreſs of time, all
theſe cauſes alter the moſt permanent forms;
and the original ſtamp of Nature never preſerves
its purity in beings which have been long under
the management of man. This original im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is beſt preſerved in thoſe animals that
have the independent choice both of their cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and food, the moſt antient of which are
ſtill faithfully repreſented by their deſcendants.
But thoſe which man has ſubdued, tranſported
from climate to climate, and changed their food,
their habits, and manner of living, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
have ſuffered the greateſt alterations in
their form; and, it is a well known fact, that
there are more varieties among the domeſtic
than the wild animals: And, of all domeſtic
animals, as the dog is moſt cloſely attached to
man, lives as irregularly, and is endowed with
diſpoſitions which render him docile, obedient,
ſuſceptible of every impreſſion, and ſubmiſſive
to every reſtraint, it is not ſurpriſing that he
ſhould likewiſe exhibit the greateſt variety in
figure, ſize, colour, and other qualities.</p>
               <p>But other cauſes concur in producing theſe
changes. The life of the dog is ſhort; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific
powers are great; and, as he is perpetually
under the eye of man, whenever by any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
which is not uncommon in Nature, ſome
individuals, marked with ſingular characters, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
they would be perpetuated by prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0195500104:17"/>
their intermixture with any other kinds, as
is done at preſent when we want to procure
new races of dogs, or of other animals. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
though every ſpecies were equally antient,
the number of generations, from the creation,
being greater in thoſe whoſe lives are ſhort,
their varieties, alterations, and even degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
muſt become more conſpicuous; becauſe
they are farther removed from the original ſtock
than thoſe which live longer. Man is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
eight times nearer Adam, than the dog to
his firſt parent; becauſe man lives eighty years,
and the dog only ten. If, therefore, by any
cauſe, theſe two ſpecies had an equal tendency
to degenerate, the alteration would be ten times
more ſtrongly marked in the dog than in man.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſmall animals whoſe lives are ſo ſhort,
that they are ſucceeded every year by a new
generation, are infinitely more ſubject to varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of every kind than thoſe which live longer.
The ſame remark is applicable to annual plants;
ſome of which may be conſidered as of an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
or factitious nature. Wheat, for example,
has been ſo greatly altered by man, that it is
now no where to be found in a natural ſtate.
It has a ſimilarity to darnel, dog's-graſs, and
ſeveral other graſſes; but ſtill we know not to
which of theſe plants it ought to be referred:
And, as it is annually renewed, is uſed as the
common food of man, and more cultivated than
any other vegetable, its nature, of courſe, has
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0195500104:18"/>
undergone the greateſt alterations. Hence man
is able, not only to make every individual in the
univerſe anſwer his own ends, but, with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of time, he can change, modify, and
improve their ſpecies. This is the chief power
he poſſeſſes over Nature. To have transformed
a barren herb into wheat, is a kind of creation,
of which, however, we have no reaſon to boaſt,
ſince it is only by the ſweet of our brows, and
reiterated culture, that we are able to extract
from the earth a ſcanty, and often a bitter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Hence, both in the animal and vegetable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
the ſpecies which have received the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
culture from man, have undergone the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
changes from their original condition: And,
as we are often unable to recogniſe their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
form, as in the example of wheat and other
grain, it is not impoſſible, that, among the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
varieties of dogs which at preſent ſubſiſt,
not one of them ſhould reſemble the firſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
of the ſpecies that virtually gave birth to
the whole.</p>
               <p>Nature, however, when not reſtrained, never
fails to reſume her rights. Wheat, when ſown
on uncultivated ground, degenerates the very
firſt year; and, if ſown for a ſucceſſion of ages
upon the ſame ground, this degeneration would
gradually proceed till the plant acquired its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
from. By an experiment of this kind,
the time required by Nature for deſtroying the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0195500104:19"/>
effects of art, and reſuming her priſtine ſtate,
might be diſcovered. This experiment might
be eaſily performed on plants: But, in animals,
there is little hope of its ſucceſs; becauſe it is
difficult to manage them with ſufficient dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or to overcome their invincible repugnance
againſt every thing that reſtrains or counteracts
their natural or acquired habits. We cannot,
therefore, expect to learn, by this method, the
primitive race of dogs, or of other animals
which are ſubjected to permanent varieties. But,
to ſupply the place of facts which cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcertained,
we may collect particular marks, and
from theſe draw probable conjectures.</p>
               <p>The domeſtic dogs which were abandoned in
the deſerts of America, and have lived in a wild
ſtate during 150 or 200 years, though original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
derived from altered races, muſt, during ſo
long a courſe of time, have made greater or
ſmaller approaches toward their primitive form.
Travellers, however, inform us, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
our grey-hounds<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. des avanturiers Flibuſtiers, par Oexmelin, tom. 1. p. 112.</note>. They make the
ſame remark with regard to the wild dogs of
Congo<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. des voyages, par l'Abbé Prevoſt, tom. 1. p. 86.</note>, which, like thoſe of America, make
war in packs againſt tigers, lions, &amp;c. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
without comparing the wild dogs of St
Domingo to grey-hounds, only obſerve, that
they have generally a long flat head, a ſlender
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0195500104:20"/>
muzzle, a ferocious air, and meagre bodies; that
they are exceedingly ſwift in the chace, hunt in
the moſt perfect manner, and eaſily tame, when
taken young<note n="*" place="bottom">Nonv. voyages aux iſles de l'Amerique, tom. 5. p. 195.</note>. Thus theſe wild dogs are very
meagre and fleet; and, as the common grey-hounds
differs little, in other reſpects, from the
Iriſh grey-hound, or from the ſhepherd's dog,
it is probable that thoſe wild dogs rather belong
to this kind than to the true grey-hound race;
for, on the other hand, the more antient travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
tell us, that the native dogs of Canada had
erect ears, like the fox, and reſembled our vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
or ſhepherd's dog<note n="†" place="bottom">Voyage du pays des Hurons, par Sabard Theodat, p. 310.</note>; that thoſe belonging

foxes<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. des Antilles, par le P. du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 306.</note>; that the Indians of Peru had only a

and that thoſe of the Iſthmus of America were
very ugly, and had long, coarſe hair, which
likewiſe implies erect ears<note n="§" place="bottom">Nouveaux voyages aux iſles de l'Amerique, tom. 5. p. 195.</note>. Hence it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that the original dogs of America, before
they had any communication with thoſe of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
were all of one race, and that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
moſt to the dogs with ſlender muzzles,
erect ears, and coarſe hair, like the ſhepherd's
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0195500104:21"/>
dog: And I am ſtill farther convinced that the
wild dogs of St Domingo are not genuine grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds,
becauſe the latter is ſo rare in France,
that they are brought, for the uſe of the King,
from Conſtantinople and other parts of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and becauſe I never knew of any grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds
being tranſported to France from St Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo,
or any of our American colonies. Beſides,
by conſulting what travellers have ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the dogs of different countries, we find that
all the dogs of cold climates have long muzzles
and erect ears; that thoſe of Lapland are ſmall,
and have long hair, erect ears, and ſharp muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage de la Martiniere, p. 75. II Genio vagante, vol. 2. p. 13.</note>;
that the Siberian dogs<note n="†" place="bottom">See plate XXIX.</note>, and thoſe called
wolf-dogs, are larger than the Lapland kind;
but their ears are ſtill erect, their hair coarſe,
and their muzzle ſharp; that thoſe of Iceland<note n="‡" place="bottom">See plate XXX.</note>
are nearly ſimilar to the Siberian dog; and, in
the ſame manner, that the native dogs of the
Cape of Good Hope<note n="‖" place="bottom">Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion du Cap. par Kolbe, part. 1. p. 304.</note>, and other warm climates,
have pointed muzzles, erect ears, long trailing
tails, and clear, but long, rough hair; that thoſe
dogs are excellent for guarding flocks, and, of
courſe, that they reſemble the ſhepherd's dog,
not only in figure, but in inſtinct; that, in ſtill
warmer climates, as at Madagaſcar<note n="§" place="bottom">Voyage de Flacourt, p. 152.</note>, Madura<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage d'Innigo de Biervillas, p. 178.</note>,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0195500104:22"/>
Calicut<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage de Francis Pyrard, tom. 1. p. 426.</note>, and Malabar<note n="†" place="bottom">Voyage de Jean Ovington, tom. 1. p. 276.</note>, the native dogs have
all long muzzles, erect ears, and have ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
to the ſhepherd's dog, that, when I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
grey-hounds, ſpaniels, water-dogs, bull-dogs,
blood-hounds, grey-hounds, &amp;c. were
tranſported thither, they degenerated at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
or third generation; laſtly, that, in exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
warm countries, as in Guiney<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. des voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, par M. l'Abbé Prevoſt, tom. 4. p. 229.</note>, this dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
is ſtill quicker; for, in three or four
years, they loſe their voice, bark no more, but
make a diſmal kind of howling noiſe; and their
progeny have erect ears, like the fox. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
dogs of thoſe countries are ugly animals,
with ſharp muzzles, long erect ears, and long
pointed tails. There is no hair on their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
their ſkin is commonly ſpotted, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of a uniform colour: In a word, they are
diſagreeable to the eye, and ſtill more ſo to the
touch.</p>
               <p>We may, therefore, ſuppoſe, with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of probability, that the ſhepherd's dog ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
nearer to the primitive race than any
of the other kinds; for in every country inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by ſavage or by half civilized men, the
native dogs reſemble this race more than any
other. Beſides, in the whole of the New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
there was no other variety; neither is
there any other at the ſouth and north extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0195500104:23"/>
of our own continent; and in France,
and other temperate climates, they are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
though greater attention has been paid
to the rearing of other more beautiful kinds,
than to the preſervation of this race, which has
no recommendation but its utility, and for that
reaſon has been abandoned to the care of the
ſheep-farmers. If it be farther conſidered, that
this dog, notwithſtanding his uglineſs, and his
wild and melancholy aſpect, is ſuperior in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
to all others; that he has a decided cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
independent of education; that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is born fully trained; that, guided ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by natural powers, he applies himſelf ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly
to the keeping of flocks, which he
executes with amazing fidelity, vigilance, and
aſſiduity; that he conducts them with an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and uncommunicated intelligence; that his
talents, at the ſame time aſtoniſh and give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to his maſter, while other dogs require the
moſt laborious inſtruction to train them to the
purpoſes for which they are deſtined; we will
be confirmed in the opinion, that the ſhepherd's
dog is the true dog of Nature; that he has been
preferably beſtowed on us for the extent of his
utility; that he has a ſuperior relation to the
general order of animated beings, who mutually
depend on each other; and, laſtly, that he ought
to be regarded as the origin and model of the
whole ſpecies.</p>
               <p>In the frozen regions of the north, the human
ſpecies is deformed, ruſtic, and diminutive. Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0195500104:24"/>
Greenland, and all countries where the
cold is exceſſive, produce only dwarfiſh and ugly
men. But, in the neighbouring and leſs rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
regions of Finland, Denmark, &amp;c. the moſt
beautiful race ſudenly appears; for, in figure,
colour, and ſtature, they are perhaps the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt
of the human kind. The ſame phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
is exhibited in the dog-ſpecies. The
Lapland dogs are very ugly, and ſo ſmall, that
they exceed not a foot in length<note n="*" place="bottom">II Genio vagante, vol. 2. p. 13.</note>. Thoſe of
Siberia, though leſs ugly, have erect ears, and a
ſavage aſpect: But, in the neighbouring climate,
where we meet with the handſome men already
mentioned<note n="†" place="bottom">See vol. 3. art. Varieties of the human ſpecies.</note>, we find alſo the moſt beautiful and
largeſt dogs. The dogs of Tartary, of Albania,
of the north of Greece, of Denmar, and of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
are the largeſt and ſtrongeſt of the ſpecies,
and are uſed for drawing carriages. The Iriſh
grey-hounds are of a very antient race, and ſtill
exiſt, though their number is ſmall, in their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
climate. They were called by the antients
dogs of Epirus, and Albanian dogs. Pliny has
recorded, in moſt elegant and energetic terms, a
combat between one of theſe dogs, firſt with a
lion, and then with an elephant<note n="‡" place="bottom">Indiam petenti Alexandro magno, Rex Albaniae dono dederat inuſitatae magnitudinis unum, cujus ſpecie delectatus, juſſit urſos. mox apros, et deinde damas emitti, contemptu im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobili jacente eo; qua ſegnitie tanti corporis offenſus Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator generoſi ſpiritus, eum interimi juſſit.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0195500104:25"/>
much larger than the maſtiff. In France, they
are ſo rare, that I never ſaw above one of them,
which appeared, when ſitting, to be about five
feet high, and reſembled in figure the Daniſh
dog<note n="*" place="bottom">See plate XXV.</note>; but greatly exceeded him in ſtature. He
was totally white, and of a mild and peaceable
diſpoſition. We find, then, in all the temperate
climates, as in Britain, France, Germany, Spain,
and Italy, men and dogs of all races. This va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
proceeds partly from the influence of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and partly from the great concourſe and
intermixture of foreigners. With regard to
dogs, I ſhall mark, with all poſſible attention,
the ſimilarities and diſcrepancies which ſhelter,
care, food, and climate, have produced among
theſe animals.</p>
               <p>The Daniſh dog<note n="†" place="bottom">See plate XXV.</note>, the Iriſh grey-hound<note n="‡" place="bottom">See plate XXIV.</note>,
and the common grey-hound<note n="‖" place="bottom">See plate XXVI.</note>, though they
appear to be different, are only the ſame dog.
The Daniſh dog is but a more corpulent Iriſh
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0195500104:26"/>
grey-hound; and the common grey-hound is
the Iriſh grey-hound rendered thinner and more
delicate by culture; for theſe three dogs, though
perfectly diſtinguiſhable at firſt ſight, differ not
more from each other than a Dutchman, a
Frenchman, and an Italian. If we ſuppoſe the
Iriſh grey-hound to have been a native of France,
he would have produced the Daniſh dog in a
colder climate, and the common grey-hound in
a warmer one: And this conjecture is even ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by experience; for the Daniſh dogs come
to us from the north, and the grey-hounds from
Conſtantinople and the Levant. The ſhepherd's
dog<note n="*" place="bottom">See plate XXVII.</note>, the Pomeranian or wolf-dog<note n="†" place="bottom">Plate XXVIII.</note>, the Sibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
dog<note n="‡" place="bottom">Plate XXIX.</note>, to which may be joined the Lapland
dog, the Canadian dog, the Hottentot dog, and
all thoſe which have erect ears, conſtitute but
one kind. They differ from the ſhepherd's dog
only in ſtature, in being more or leſs groſs, or
in the length, coarſeneſs, or buſhineſs of their
hair. The hound<note n="‖" place="bottom">Plate XXXI.</note>, the harrier<note n="§" place="bottom">Plate XXXII.</note>, the turnſpit<note n="**" place="bottom">Plate XXXIV.</note>,
the water-dog<note n="††" place="bottom">Plate XXXVI.</note>, and even the ſpaniel<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">Plate XXXVII.</note>, may
be regarded as one dog. Their figure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts
are nearly the ſame; and they differ only
in the length of their legs, and the ſize of their
ears, which, however, in all of them are long,
ſoft, and pendulous. Theſe dogs are natives of
France; and I am uncertain whether the Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0195500104:27"/>
dog<note n="*" place="bottom">Dalmatia, I have been informed, ſays Mr Pennant, is the country of this elegant dog. As for thoſe of India, they are generally ſmall, and very ugly, or, if the European dogs are brought there, they immediately degenerate. <hi>Synopſ. of quad.</hi> p. 145.</note>, or, as it is called, the harrier of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
ought to be disjoined from them; for it
differs from our harrier only in colour. I am
convinced that this dog is not an original native
of Bengal, or of any other part of India, and
that it is not, as has been pretended, the Indian
dog mentioned by the antients, and ſaid to have
been produced between a dog and a tiger; for
it has been known in Italy above 170 years
ago, and not conſidered as a dog brought
from India, but as a common harrier: 'Canis
ſagax, vulgo brachus,' ſays Aldrovandus, 'an
unius vel varii coloris ſit, parum refert; in

               <p>Britain, France, Germany, &amp;c. appear to have
given birth to the hound, the harrier, and the
turnſpit: When tranſported into climates a little
warmer, as Turkey or Perſia, theſe dogs dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.
But the ſpaniels and water-dogs are
natives of Spain and Barbary, where the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of the climate renders the hair of all
animals longer and finer than in any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
The bull-dog<note n="‡" place="bottom">See plate XLII.</note>, what is improperly called
the ſmall Daniſh dog, for it has no other reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0195500104:28"/>
to the Daniſh dog<note n="*" place="bottom">See Plate XXV.</note> than the ſhortneſs of
its hair, the naked or Turkiſh dog<note n="†" place="bottom">Plate XLI.</note>, and the
Iceland dog<note n="‡" place="bottom">Plate XXX.</note>, conſtitute but one race, which,
being tranſported from cold countries, where the
fur is always ſtrong, into the warmer climates
of Africa and India, have loſt their hair; for
the naked dog is improperly called the Turkiſh
dog: It is not in the temperate climate of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key
that dogs loſe their hair, but in Guiney,
and the warm regions of India. The Turkiſh
dog is nothing but the ſmall Daniſh dog, which
has firſt been tranſported to a very warm climate,
where it caſt its hair, and then afterwards
brought to Turkey, and propagated carefully on
account of its ſingularity. The firſt of them,
ſays Aldrovandus, which appeared in Europe,
were brought into Italy in his own time, where
they could not be propagated, becauſe the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
was too cold for them. But, as he gives
no deſcription of theſe naked dogs, we know
not whether they were ſimilar to what is now
called the Turkiſh, nor, conſequently, whether
they can be referred to the ſmall Daniſh dog;
becauſe dogs of every kind loſe their hair in very
warm climates<note n="‖" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. des Voyages, par. M. l'Abbé Prevoſt, tom. 4. p. 229.</note>; and, as formerly remarked,
they alſo loſe their voice. In ſome countries,
they are perfectly mute; in others, they loſe
only the faculty of barking, but howl like wolves,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0195500104:29"/>
or yelp like foxes. This change ſeems to make
them approach to their natural ſtate; for both
their figure and inſtincts are altered: They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
an ugly aſpect, and their ears become erect
and pointed<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage de la Böullaye-le Gouz, p. 257.; Voyages de Jean Ovington, tom.

that dogs preſerve their ardour, courage, ſagacity,
and other talents. They loſe every thing, when
tranſported to very hot countries. But, as if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
never made any being perfectly uſeleſs, in
climates where dogs cannot ſerve the purpoſes for
which we employ them, they are in great requeſt
for the table, and their fleſh is preferred by the
Negroes to that of all other animals. They ſell
dogs in the market as dear as mutton, veniſon,
or game of any kind, a roaſted dog being the
moſt luxurious feaſt to a Negro. Perhaps this
remarkable appetite for dogs fleſh is owing to a
change produced in its quality by the heat of the
country; for, in our climates, it is extremely
diſagreeable. But I am inclined to think that
this appetite depends more on the nature of man
than that of the dog; for the ſavages of Canada,
who inhabit a cold country, are equally fond of
dogs fleſh with the Negroes; and our miſſionaries
ſometimes eat of it without diſguſt. P. Sabard
Theodat remarks, 'that dogs are uſed, as we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0195500104:30"/>
uſe mutton, at feaſts. I have ſeveral times
been preſent at theſe dog-feaſts, which at firſt
ſtruck me with a degree of horror; but, after
taſting it twice, I found that the fleſh was good,
and had a flavour ſomewhat reſembling that
of pork<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage au pays des Hurons, par le P. Sabard Theodat, p. 311.</note>.'</p>
               <p>In our climates, the wolf and fox make the
neareſt approach to the dog, particularly to
the ſhepherd's dog, which I conſider as the
original ſtock of the ſpecies: And, as their
internal ſtructure is almoſt entirely the ſame,
and their external differences very ſlight, I
wiſhed to try if they would intermix and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
together. I hoped, at leaſt, to make them
copulate; and, if they produced not fertile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals,
I expected to procure mules which
would participate of the nature of both animals.
With this view, I reared a ſhe-wolf, taken in
the woods at the age of three months, along
with an Iriſh grey-hound of the ſame age. They
were ſhut up together in a pretty large court, to
which no other beaſt could have acceſs, and
where they were provided with a ſhelter for
their retirement. They were equally ſtrangers
to any individual of their own ſpecies, and knew
no perſon but the man who gave them their
victuals. They were kept in this ſtate three
years, without the ſmalleſt reſtraint. During
the firſt year, they played perpetually, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be extremely fond of each other. The
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0195500104:31"/>
ſecond year they began to quarrel about their
food, though they were ſupplied in a plentiful
manner. The wolf always began the diſpute.
When meat and bones were given them on a
large wooden diſh, the wolf, inſtead of ſeizing
the meat, inſtantly drove off the dog, then laid
hold of the edge of the plate ſo dexterouſly as
to allow nothing to fall, and carried off the whole.
I have ſeen her run, in this manner, with the diſh
in her teeth, five or ſix times round the wall,
and never ſet it down, unleſs to take breath, to
devour the meat, or to attack the dog, when he
approached. The dog was ſtronger than the
wolf: But, as he was leſs ferocious, we began
to be apprehenſive for his life, and therefore
furniſhed him with a collar. After the ſecond
year, theſe quarrels and combats became more
frequent, and more ſerious, and a collar was alſo
given to the wolf, whom the dog now handled
more roughly than before.</p>
               <p>During theſe two years, not the ſmalleſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of deſire appeared either in the one or the
other. At the end of the third year, they
began to feel all the ardour of paſſion; but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
no marks of love. This condition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of ſoftening and making them approach
each other, rendered them more untractable and
ferocious. Nothing now was heard but diſmal
howlings, and cries of reſentment. In three
weeks they were both very meagre; but never
approached but to tear each other. At laſt they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0195500104:32"/>
fought ſo cruelly that the dog killed the wolf.
The dog was ſhot ſome days after, becauſe,
as ſoon as he was ſet at liberty, he ſprung with
fury upon poultry, dogs, and even men.</p>
               <p>I had, at the ſame time, three young foxes,
two males and a female, which were taken with
nets, and kept in ſeparate apartments. One of
them was ſecured by a long, light chain, and a
hut was built for ſheltering him. I kept him
ſeveral months; and, though he had a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
air, and kept his eyes fixed upon the fields,
of which he had a view from his hut, yet both
his health and appetite were good. A bitch in
ſeaſon was preſented to him; but, as ſhe would
not remain near the fox, ſhe was chained in the
ſame place, and both were amply provided with
victuals. The fox neither bit nor maletreated
her. During ten days that they lived together,
there was not the ſmalleſt quarrel, neither night
nor day, nor during the time of feeding. The
fox even approached her pretty familiarly; but,
as ſoon as he had ſcented her too near, the mark
of deſire diſappeared, he mournfully return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his hut, and no commixture took place.
When the ardour of this bitch was gone, another,
and afterwards a third, and a fourth, were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
preſented to him. He treated them
with the ſame gentleneſs, and the ſame indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
To aſcertain whether this indifference
was owing to a natural repugnance, or to a ſtate
of reſtraint, he was furniſhed with a female of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0195500104:33"/>
his own ſpecies, which he covered more than
once the firſt day. The female was diſſected
ſome weeks after, and four foetus's were found
in the uterus. The male fox was then let looſe
in a cloſe court, and ſucceſſively furniſhed with
ſeveral bitches in ſeaſon: He diſcovered neither
hatred nor love to them; and he died of chagrin
and melancholy a few months afterwards.</p>
               <p>From theſe experiments we learn, that the
wolf and fox are very different in their natures
from the dog; that their ſpecies are ſo diſtinct
and remote from each other, as to prevent their
commixture, at leaſt in our climates; that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
the dog derives not his origin from
the wolf or the fox; and that the nomencla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors<note n="*" place="bottom">Canis cauda ſiniſtrorſum recurvata, <hi>the dog.</hi> Canis cauda incurvata, <hi>the wolf.</hi> Canis cauda recta, apice albo, <hi>the fox. Linn. Syſt. p</hi> 59.</note>,

The congreſs was immediate, and as uſual between dog and bitch: She produced ten pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies. I have ſeen one of them that had very much the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the wolf, and much of its nature: Being ſlipped at a weak deer, it inſtantly caught at the animal's throat, and killed it.'—It is to be regretted, that Mr Pennant gives no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation as to the fertility or ſterility of theſe mules.</note>.

In warm climates, there is a ferocious animal
which differs leſs from the dog than the wolf
or fox: This animal, called the <hi>Jackal,</hi> has
been well deſcribed by travellers. They are
very numerous in Aſia, and Africa, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of Trebiſond<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyages de Gemell: Carreri, tom. 1. p. 419.</note>, round Mount Cauca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
in Mingrelia<note n="†" place="bottom">Chardin, p. 76.</note>, Natolia<note n="‡" place="bottom">Voyage de Dumont, tom. 4. p. 28.</note>, Hyrcania<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chardin, tom. 2. p. 29.</note>, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,

Bengal, Congo<note n="**" place="bottom">Voyage de Boſman, p. 241. 331. Voyage du P. Zuchel, p. 293.</note>, and ſeveral other places.
Though this animal is conſidered by the natives
as a wild dog, yet, as it is doubtful whether they
intermix and produce together, we ſhall treat of
the jackal, the wolf, and the dog, as ſeparate
and diſtinct ſpecies.</p>
               <p>I pretend not abſolutely to affirm, that the
jackal, or even the wolf and fox, in no age or
country, never intermixed with dogs. The
contrary is aſſerted poſitively by the antients.
Ariſtotle<note n="††" place="bottom">Ariſt. de generat. animal. lib. 2. cap. 5.</note> remarks, that, though animals of
different ſpecies intermingle ſeldom; yet it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
happens among dogs, foxes, and wolves:
He adds, that the Indian dogs proceed from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
ſimilar wild beaſt and the dog. This wild
beaſt, to which he gives no name, is probably
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0195500104:35"/>
the jackal. But he obſerves, in another place<note n="†" place="bottom">Idem, hiſt. animal. lib. 8. cap. 28.</note>,
that the Indian dogs proceed from a commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
between the tiger and the bitch. This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is extremely improbable; beeauſe the tiger,
both in his form and diſpoſitions, differs much
more from the dog than the wolf, the fox, or
the jackal. Ariſtotle indeed appears to violate
his own argument; for, after telling us, that
the Indian dogs proceeded from a wild beaſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
to the wolf or fox, he ſays afterwards,
that they proceed from the tiger, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
whether this conjunction was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the tiger and bitch, or between the dog
and tigreſs: He only adds, that the affair did
not ſucceed till the third trial; that the firſt lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſiſted ſolely of tigers; that dogs were
chained in the deſerts, and, unleſs the tiger was
in ſeaſon, they were often devoured; that the
great heat, and ſcarcity of water, made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of monſters and prodigies very frequent
in Africa, becauſe numbers of animals were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to aſſemble in the ſame place in order to
drink, where they often grew familiar and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
together. All this ſeems to be not only
conjectural and uncertain, but ſuſpicious, and
unworthy of credit; for, the more narrowly we
examine the nature of animals, we perceive that
inſtinct is the moſt certain criterion for judging
of them. By the moſt attentive inſpection of
their internal parts, we diſcovér only ſlight dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0195500104:36"/>
The horſe and aſs, though perfectly
ſimilar in their internal ſtructure, are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in their natures. The internal parts of
the bull, the ram, and the he-goat, are exactly
the ſame; yet they conſtitute three ſpecies more
remote from each other than the aſs and horſe:
The ſame remark is applicable to the dog; the
fox, and the wolf. We derive more light from
inſpecting the external form. But as, in ſpecies
which are not remote, there are, even external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
more reſemblances than diſcrepancies, this
inſpection is not ſufficient to determine whether
they belong to the ſame or to different ſpecies.
In a word, when the ſhades are ſtill lighter,
they muſt be combined with the information
derived from inſtinct. It is from the diſpoſitions
of animals that we ought to judge of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
If we ſuppoſe two animals perfectly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
in form, but very different in their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
they would neither join nor produce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
but conſtitute two diſtinct ſpecies.</p>
               <p>This mode of judging concerning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of neighbouring ſpecies, is the only one
that can be employed when we want to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the numerous varieties which take place
in the ſame ſpecies. We know thirty fixed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
of dogs, though we certainly are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the whole. Of theſe thirty va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties,
there are ſeventeen which ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to the influence of climate, namely, the
ſhepherd's dog, the Pomeranian dog, the Sibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0195500104:37"/>
dog, the Iceland dog, the Lapland dog, the
Iriſh grey-hound, the common grey-hound, the
maſtiff, the great Daniſh dog, the hound, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,
the terrier, the ſpaniel, the water dog, the
ſmall Daniſh dog, the Turkiſh dog, and the
bull-dog. The other thirteen, which are the
mongrel Turkiſh dog, the grey-hound with hair
like an wolf, the ſhock-dog, or lap-dog, the
baſtard pug-dog, the pug-dog, the Calabrian,
Burgos, and Alicant dogs, the lion-dog, the
ſmall water dog, the dog of Artois, and the
King Charles's dog, are nothing but mongrels
produced by the commixture of the above ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
races; and, by tracing each of theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grels
back to the two races from which they
ſprung, their natures will then be ſufficiently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcertained.
But, if we want to know the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which ſubſiſt between the firſt ſeventeen
races, we muſt attend to their inſtincts, their
figure, and many other circumſtances. I have
put into one group the ſhepherd's dog, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meranian
dog, the Siberian dog, the Lapland and
Iceland dogs, becauſe a ſtronger reſemblance
takes place between them than between any of
the other kinds, and becauſe all of them have
ſharp muzzles like the fox, erect ears, and an
inſtinct which induces them to follow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
flocks. The grey-hound, the large Daniſh
dog, and the Iriſh grey-hound have, beſide their
ſimilarity in figure and length of muzzle, the
ſame diſpoſitions: They are found of running,
and of following horſes and carriages. They
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0195500104:38"/>
have little ſcent, and hunt rather by the eye
than the noſe. The hounds, the harriers, the
ſpaniels, the terriers, and the water-dogs, are the
true hunting dogs. Though they differ a little
in figure, they have all thick muzzles, and the
ſame inſtincts; and therefore they ought to be
ranked together. The ſpaniel, for example, has
been called by ſome naturaliſts, <hi>canis aviarius
terreſtris,</hi> and the water-dog, <hi>canis aviarius aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus.</hi>
The only difference in diſpoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two dogs is, that the water-dog,
with his long, buſhy-hair, takes the water more
chearfully than the others, whoſe hair is ſmooth
and ſhort. Laſtly, the ſmall Daniſh dog and the
Turkiſh dog muſt be joined together, ſince the
latter is ſaid to be the ſame dog with the former,
only deprived of his hair by the effects of heat.
There remains only the bull-dog, which, from
the ſhortneſs of his muzzle, reſembles the little
Daniſh dog, but differs from him ſo much, both
in figure and inſtinct, as to form a particular
variety. He ſeems alſo to affect a particular
climate: He comes from Britain, and it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to preſerve the breed in France. The
mongrels that proceed from him, which are the
maſtiff and the pug-dog, ſucceed better. All
theſe dogs have very ſhort muzzles, little ſcent,
and often ſend forth a diſagreeable ſmell. The
fineneſs of ſcent ſeems to depend more on the
largeneſs than the length of the muzzle; for
the grey-hound, the large Daniſh dog, and the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0195500104:39"/>
Iriſh grey-hound, have leſs ſcent than the hound,
the harrier, the tarrier, the ſpaniel, or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-dog,
who have all, in proportion to their
ſize, ſhorter, but broader muzzles, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>The greater or leſſer perfection of the ſenſes
forms not, in man, an eminent or remarkable
quality; but beſtows on the other animals all
their merit, and produces, as a cauſe, all the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
of which they are ſuſceptible. I mean not
to enumerate all the qualities of hunting dogs.
The ſuperiority they poſſes over other animals,
by the excellence and acuteneſs of their ſenſe of
ſmelling, is well known. But details of this
kind are remotely connected with natural hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.
Beſides, the artifices and dexterity,
though derived ſolely from nature, employed
by wild animals to conceal themſelves, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the purſuit of the dogs, are perhaps more
worthy of admiration than the moſt refined me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical
exhibitions derived from the art of
hunting.</p>
               <p>The dog, like every other animal which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
above one or two at a time, is not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
formed immediately after birth. Dogs are
commonly brought forth blind. The two eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
are not ſimply glued together, but ſhut up
with a membrane, which is torn off as ſoon as
the muſcles of the upper eye-lid acquire ſtrength
ſufficient to overcome this obſtacle to viſion,
which generally happens about the tenth or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0195500104:40"/>
twelfth day. At this period, the bones of the
head are not completed, the body and muzzle are
turgid, and the whole figure is ill defined. But,
in leſs than two months, they learn to uſe all
their ſenſes; their growth is rapid, and they ſoon
acquire ſtrength. In the fourth month, they
loſe ſome of their teeth, which, as in other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
are ſoon replaced, and never again fall
out. The number of teeth is forty-two, namely,
ſix cutting and two canine teeth in each jaw, and
fourteen grinders in the upper and twelve in
the under. But the number of grinders is
not uniform, being greater or leſs in particular
dogs. When very young, both males and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
ſquat down a little to void their urine:
In the ninth or tenth month, they begin to raiſe
the thigh, when they perform this operation;
and, at the ſame period, they acquire the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of procreating. The male is ready at all
times; but the female receives him only at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
fixed ſeaſons, which generally happen
twice a-year, and more frequently in winter
than in ſummer. The ardour of the female
continues ten, twelve, and ſometimes fifteen
days; and it is known by external ſigns, which
appear ſome days before ſhe admits the male:
The parts become moiſt and prominent; and
this phaenomenon is always accompanied with
a ſmall flux of blood. The male diſcovers the
condition of the female by a peculiar ſmell; but
ſhe ſeldom receives him for the firſt ſix or ſeven
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0195500104:41"/>
days. One embrace is ſometimes ſufficient to
make her conceivé a great number of young;
but, when not reſtrained, ſhe will admit ſeveral
dogs every day. She ſeems to have no predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
excepting in favour of the largeſt dogs,
without regarding their figure or beauty. Hence
it frequently happens, that a ſmall female, who
has admitted a large male, dies in bringing forth
her young.</p>
               <p>But a ſingularity in theſe animals, ariſing from
the ſtructure of their organs, they are incapable
of ſeparating, after conſummation, but are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to remain united as long as the erection
ſubſiſts. The dog, like ſeveral other animals,
has not only a bone in the penis, but, in the
middle of the corpus cavernoſum, there is a large
hollow ring, which, in time of copulation, ſwells
to a conſiderable ſize. The female, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, has a larger clitoris than perhaps any
other animal; beſides, in the time of coition, a
large firm protuberance ariſes, and remains, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
longer than that of the male, and prevents
him from retiring till it ſubſides; for, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after conſummation, he changes his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in order to repoſe on his four legs; his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
is melancholy, and the efforts for ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
never proceed from the female.</p>
               <p>The time of geſtation is nine weeks, or 63
days, ſometimes 62 or 61, but never leſs than
60. The females produce ſix, ſeven, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
even twelve puppies. The largeſt and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0195500104:42"/>
talleſt are more prolific than the ſmaller kinds,
which often produce only four or five, and
ſometimes but one or two, eſpecially at the firſt
litters, which, in all animals, are always leſs nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
than the ſubſequent ones.</p>
               <p>Dogs, though extremely ardent in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
continue to propagate during life, which
is generally limited to fourteen or fifteen years,
though ſome have been known to live to the
age of twenty. The duration of life in the dog,
as in other animals, is proportioned to the
time of his growth, which is not comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in leſs than two years, and he lives four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.
His age may be diſcovered by his teeth,
which, when young, are white, ſharp, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But, as he increaſes in years, they become
black, blunt, and unequal. It may likewiſe be
known by the hair, which turns grey on the
muzzle, front, and round the eyes.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals, which are naturally vigilant,
active, and frolickſome, by being over-fed in
our houſes, become ſo heavy and ſlothful, that
they paſs their lives in ſleeping and eating. Their
ſleep, which is almoſt perpetual, is accompanied
with dreams, which is perhaps a gentle mode of
exiſting. They are naturally voracious; and yet
they can endure very long abſtinence. In the
Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, we have
the hiſtory of a bitch, that, having been forgot
in a country-houſe, lived forty days, without
any other nouriſhment than the wool of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0195500104:43"/>
which ſhe had torn to pieces<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. de l'Acad. des. ſciences, année 1706, p. 5.</note> Water
ſeems to be more neceſſary to dogs than victuals;
for they drink often and very plentifully: It is
even a vulgar opinion, that, when they want
water too long, they become mad. It is alſo a
peculiarity in dogs, that they make great efforts,
and ſeem to ſuffer much pain, in voiding their
excrement. This happens not, as Ariſtotle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges<note n="†" place="bottom">Ariſt. de partibus animal. lib. ult.</note>,
becauſe their inteſtines become narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in approaching the anus. On the contrary,
it is certain, that, in the dog, as in other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
the great inteſtines enlarge as they proceed
downward, and that the rectum is larger than
the colon. The dry temperament of this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
and not the ſtrangulations of the colon,
which are too diſtant from the rectum, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to produce this effect.</p>
               <p>To give a clear idea of the different kinds of
dogs, of their degeneration in particular climates,
and of the mixture of their races, I have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
a table, or genealogical tree, in which all
theſe varieties may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed. This
tree is drawn in the form of a geographical
chart, preſerving as much as poſſible the poſition
of the different climates to which each variety
naturally belongs. The ſhepherd's dog is the
root of the tree. This dog, when tranſported
into Lapland, or other very cold climates, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
an ugly appearance, and ſhrinks into a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0195500104:44"/>
ſmaller ſize. But, in Ruſſia, Iceland, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria,
where the climate is leſs rigorous, and
the people a little more advanced in civilization,
he ſeems to be better accompliſhed. Theſe
changes are occaſioned ſolely by the influence
of thoſe climates, which produce no great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the figure of this dog; for, in each of
theſe climates, his ears are erect, his hair thick
and long, his aſpect wild, and he barks leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
and in a different manner, than in more
favourable climates, where he acquires a finer
poliſh. The Iceland dog is the only one that
has not his ears entirely erect; for their extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
are a little inclined; and Iceland, of all
the northern regions, has been longeſt inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by half civilized men.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſhepherd's dog, when brought into
temperate climates, and among a people perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
civilized, as Britain, France, Germany, whould,
by the mere influence of the climate, loſe his
ſavage aſpect, his erect ears, his rude, thick,
long hair, and aſſume the figure of a bull-dog,
the hound, and the Iriſh grey-hound. The bull-dog
and Iriſh grey-hound have their ears ſtill
partly erect, and very much reſemble, both in
their manners and ſanguinary temper, the dog
from which they derive their origin. The
hound is fartheſt removed from the ſhepherd's
dog; for his ears are long and entirely pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
The gentleneſs, docility, and even the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity
of the hound, are proofs of his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0195500104:45"/>
or rather of the great perfection he
has acquired by the long and careful education
beſtowed on him by man.</p>
               <p>The hound, the harrier, and the terrier, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
but one race; for, it has been remarked,
that, in the ſame litter, hounds, harriers, and
terriers, have been brought forth, though the
female hound had been covered by only one of
theſe three dogs. I have joined the common
harrier to the Dalmatian dog, or harrier of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
becauſe they differ only in having more or
fewer ſpots on their coat. I have alſo linked
the turnſpit, or terrier with crooked legs, with
the common terrier; becauſe the defect in the
legs of the former has originally proceeded from
a diſeaſe ſimilar to the rickets, with which ſome
individuals had been affected, and tranſmitted
the deformity to their deſcendants.</p>
               <p>The hound, when tranſported into Spain and
Barbary, where all animals have fine, long,
buſhy hair, would be converted into the ſpaniel
and water-dog. The great and ſmall ſpaniel,
which differ only in ſize, when brought into
Britain, have changed their white colour into
black, and become, by the influence of climate,
the great and little King Charles's dog: To theſe
may be joined the Pyrame<note n="*" place="bottom">This dog, though very common in Britain, has no Engliſh name.</note>, which is only a
King Charles's dog, black like the others, but
marked with red on the four legs, and a ſpot of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0195500104:46"/>
the ſame colour above each eye, and on the
muzzle.</p>
               <p>The Iriſh grey-hound, tranſported to the
north, is become the great Daniſh dog; and,
when carried to the ſouth, was converted into
the common grey-hound. The largeſt grey-hounds
come from the Levant, thoſe of a ſmaller
ſize from Italy; and thoſe Italian grey-hounds,
carried into Britain, have been ſtill farther dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
               <p>The great Daniſh dog, tranſported into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
the Ukraine, Tartary, Epirus, and Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
has been changed into the Iriſh grey-hound,
which is the largeſt of all dogs.</p>
               <p>The bull-dog, tranſported from Britain to
Denmark, is become the little Daniſh dog; and
the latter, brought into warm climates, has been
converted into the Turkiſh dog. All theſe races,
with their varieties, have been produced by the
influence of cliamte, joined to the effects of
ſhelter, food, and education. The other dogs
are not pure races, but have proceeded from
commixtures of thoſe already deſcribed. I have
marked, in the table, by dotted lines, the double
origin of theſe mongrels.</p>
               <p>The grey-hound, and Iriſh grey-hound, have
produced the mongrel grey-hound, called alſo
the grey-hound with wolf's hair. The muzzle
of this mongrel is leſs pointed than that of the
true grey-hound, which is very rare in France.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0195500104:47"/>
The great Daniſh dog, and the large ſpaniel,
have produced the Calabrian dog, which is a
beautiful animal, with long buſhy hair, and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the Iriſh grey-hound.</p>
               <p>The ſpaniel and terrier have produced the dog
called <hi>Burgos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the ſpaniel and little Daniſh dog, has
proceeded the lion-dog, which is now very rare.</p>
               <p>The dogs with long, fine, criſped hair, called
the <hi>Bouffe</hi> dogs, and which are larger than the
water-dog, proceed from the ſpaniel and water-dog.</p>
               <p>The little water-dog comes from the water-dog
and ſmall ſpaniel.</p>
               <p>From the bull-dog and Iriſh grey-hound, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
a mongrel called the <hi>maſtiff,</hi> which is lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the bull-dog, and reſembles the latter
more than the Iriſh grey-hound.</p>
               <p>The pug-dog proceeds from the bull-dog and
ſmall Daniſh dog.</p>
               <p>All theſe dogs are ſimple mongrels, and are
produced by the commixture of two pure races.
But there are other dogs, called <hi>double mongrels,</hi>
becauſe they proceed from the junction of a pure
race with a mongrel.</p>
               <p>The baſtard pug-dog is a double mongrel
from a mixture of the pug-dog with the little
Daniſh dog.</p>
               <p>The Alicant dog is alſo a double mongrel,
proceeding from the pug-dog and ſmall ſpaniel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0195500104:48"/>
The Malteſe, or lap-dog, is a double mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel,
produced between the ſmall ſpaniel and
little water-dog.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there are dogs which may be called <hi>triple
mongrels,</hi> becauſe they are produced by two mixed
races. Of this kind are the Artois and Iſlois
dogs, which are produced by the pug-dog and
the baſtard pug-dog; to which may be added
the dogs called <hi>ſtreet-dogs,</hi> which reſemble no
particular kind, becauſe they proceed from races
which have previouſly been ſeveral times mixed.</p>

to me a fact, which merits a place in
the Natural hiſtory of the dog. The following
is an extract of his letter upon this ſubject, dated
October 6. 1772.</p>
                  <p>"The curate of Norges, near Dijon, had a
bitch, which, without either having ever been
pregnant, or delivered of puppies, had all the
ſymptoms which characteriſe theſe two ſtates.

When the common term of geſtation was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
her paps were diſtended with milk,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0195500104:49"/>
without being irritated by any particular treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for it is poſſible to bring milk into the
dugs of animals by frequently chaffing them.
But, in this caſe, every thing was the effect
of nature; and this bitch ſuckled ſome young
puppies with which ſhe was furniſhed, and
for whom ſhe diſcovered as much tenderneſs
and attention, as if ſhe had been their real
mother. All this I ſaw with my eyes. But,
what is ſtill more ſingular, this ſame bitch, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three years ago, ſuckled two young cats,
one of which participated ſo much of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of its nurſe, that its cries had more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
to the barking of a dog, than to
the mewing of a cat."</p>
                  <p>If the production of milk, without impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were more frequent among quadrupeds,
it would make them analogous to female birds,
which lay eggs without the aſſiſtance of the
male.</p>

                  <head>OF THE VARIETIES OF DOGS.</head>
                  <p>A few years ago, at the fair of Saint Germain,
there was a Siberian dog, which appeared to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſo much from that repreſented in Plate XXIX.
as to merit a ſhort deſcription. It was covered
with long hair, hanging almoſt down to the
ground. At firſt ſight, it reſembled a large lion-dog;
but its ears were erect, and much larger.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0195500104:50"/>
Its colour was all white, and its length, from the
noſe to the extremity of the body, was 21 inches
and a half; and its height behind was 11 inches
nine lines, and 11 inches three lines before. The
eye was of a brown cheſnut colour, and the end
of the noſe, as well as round the noſtrils and
mouth, were black. The ears were buſhy, of a
whitiſh yellow within, and yellow on the edges
and extremities. The long hair of its head part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concealed the eyes, and fell down upon the
noſe. Its toes and claws were alſo hid by the
hair of its legs. The tail, which turned up like
that of the Pomeranian dog, was covered with
hair about ſeven or eight inches long. This is
certainly the rougheſt furred of all dogs.</p>
                  <p>Other dogs, brought to Paris by the Ruſſians,
which they called <hi>Siberian dogs,</hi> belonged to a
very different race from the preceding. Both
male and female were about the ſize of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
grey-hound. The noſe was ſharp, the ears
half erect, but bended a little in the middle.
They were not ſlender, like the grey-hound,
but round and full below the belly. Their tail
was about eight or nine inches in length, pretty
thick, and obtuſe at the extremity. Their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
was black, without any mixtùre of white
hairs; but the female had a grey tuft on the
middle of the head, and the male a tuft of the
ſame colour at the end of the tail. They were
troubleſome with their careſſes, and ſo voracious
that they could never be ſatiated. They were,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0195500104:51"/>
at the ſame time, inſufferably dirty, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
roaming about in queſt of food. Their
legs were tollerably handſome; but their feet
were large and broad, and their toes united by a
membrane. Their voice was very ſtrong; they
had no inclination to bite; they careſſed every
perſon indiſcriminately; and their vivacity was
inexpreſſible<note n="*" place="bottom">Extracted from a letter of M. Paſumot of the academy of Dijon, to M. de Buffon, dated March 2. 1775.</note>. From this deſcription, it appears,
that theſe pretended Siberian dogs, are of the
ſame race with that I have called the Iceland dog,
whoſe figure is engraven Plate XXX. which
exhibits a number of the characters mentioned in
the above delineation.</p>
                  <p>'I have made ſome inquiry,' ſays Mr Colin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
'concerning the dogs of Siberia. Thoſe
which draw ſleds and carts are of a middle ſize:
Their noſe is ſharp, and their ears long and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.
They carry their tail bended, ſome of
them like the wolf, and others like the fox;
and it is certain, that they copulate with wolves
and foxes. I ſee, from your experiments, that,
when theſe animals are confined, they will not
intermix; but, when at full liberty, they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
come together. With regard to the dog
and wolf, I myſelf have ſeen them couple in
England. But I have never met with any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who ſaw dogs and foxes intermingle.
However, from a kind I ſaw produced from a
bitch, which had lived at freedom in the woods,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0195500104:52"/>
I have no doubt that ſhe had been impregnated
by a fox. The peaſants know this ſpecies, and
diſtinguiſh it by the name of the <hi>fox-dogs.</hi>'</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the Greenland dogs are white; but
ſome of them are black, with very buſhy hair.
They rather may be ſaid to howl than bark;
and they are ſtupid, and unfit for every ſpecies
of hunting. They ſerve, however, for dragging
ſleds, to which they are yoked by fours and ſixes.
The Greenlanders eat the dog's fleſh, and make
garments of his ſkin<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 39.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The dogs of Kamtſchatka are rude, and half
ſavage, like their maſters. They are commonly
black or white, and more nimble and active than
our dogs. They are great eaters of fiſh, and
are uſed for drawing ſleds. In ſummer, they
have their liberty; but are collected together in
the month of October, for the purpoſe of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſleds; and, during winter, they are fed
with a kind of paſte compoſed of fiſh, which
is allowed to ferment in a ditch, and given to
them half boiled<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 39.</note>.</p>
                  <p>From theſe facts, it appears, that the Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
and Kamtſchatkan dogs, and perhaps thoſe
of other northern regions, have a greater reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to the Iceland dog, than to any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
races; for the above deſcription of the two
Ruſſian dogs, as well as the notices concerning
thoſe of Greenland and Kamtſchatka, correſpond
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0195500104:53"/>
very well, and may be equally applied to our
Iceland dog.</p>
                  <p>Though we have deſcribed all the varieties
which we could collect, there are ſtill ſome
which could not be procured. For example,
there is a race of wild dogs, of which I have ſeen
two individuals, but had not an opportunity of
either deſcribing or delineating them. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
and learned M. Aubry, curate of Saint
Louis, has often furniſhed us with animals of
which we had no knowledge. He informs us, that,
a few years ago, he ſaw a dog, nearly of the ſize
of a ſpaniel, which had long hair, and a large
beard on its chin. This dog was produced from
parents of the ſame race with thoſe which had
formerly been ſent ot Lowis XIV. by M. le
Comte de Toulouſe. M. le Comte de Laſſai had
alſo ſome of theſe dogs; but I know not what
has become of this ſingular race.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the wild dogs, among which
there are different races, as well as among the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
kinds, I have little to add to what I have
ſaid in my original work. M. le Vicomte de
Querhoënt has been ſo obliging as to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to me a note with regard to the wild dog
found in the environs of the Cape of Good Hope.
He remarks, 'That, at the Cape, there are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
packs of wild dogs, as large as our
largeſt kinds, whoſe ſkin is marked with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
colours. They have erect ears, run with
great ſwiftneſs, and have no fixed reſidence.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0195500104:54"/>
They deſtroy an incredible quantity of deer.
They are ſeldom ſlain, and very difficult to take
in ſnares; for they have an averſion to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
any thing that has been touched by
man. As their young are ſometimes met with
in the woods, attempts have been made to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them domeſtic; but they are ſo large, and
ſo ferocious, that theſe attempts have always
been abortive.'</p>

               <p>THE cat is an unfaithful domeſtic, and kept
only from the neceſſity we find of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him to other domeſtics ſtill more incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and which cannot be hunted; for we make
no account of thoſe people, who, being fond of
all brutes, fooliſhly keep cats for their amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Though theſe animals, when young, are
frolickſome and beautiful, they poſſeſs, at the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0195500104:78"/>
ſame time, an innate malice, and perverſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
which increaſe as they grow up, and
which education learns them to conceal, but not
to ſubdue. From determined robbers, the beſt
education can only convert them into flattering
thieves; for they have the ſame addreſs, ſubtlety
and deſire of plunder. Like thieves, they know
how to conceal their ſteps and their deſigns, to
watch opportunities, to catch the proper moment
for laying hold of their prey, to fly from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
and to remain at a diſtance till ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to return. They eaſily aſſume the habits of
ſociety, but never acquire its manners; for they
have only the appearance of attachment or
friendſhip. This diſingenuity of character is
betrayed by the obliquity of their movements,
and the duplicity of their eyes. They never
look their beſt benefactor in the face; but, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from diſtruſt or falſeneſs, they approach him
by windings, in order to procure careſſes, in
which they have no other pleaſure than what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
from flattering thoſe who beſtow them.
Very different from that faithful animal the dog,
whoſe ſentiments totally centre in the perſon and
happineſs of his maſter, the cat appears to have
no feelings which are not intereſted, to have no
affection that is not conditional, and to carry on
no intercourſe with men, but in the view of
turning it to his own advantage. By theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
the cat has a greater relation to man
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0195500104:79"/>
than to the dog, in whom there is not the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
mark of inſincerity or unjuſtice.</p>
               <p>The form and temperament of the cat's body
perfectly accord with his temper and diſpoſitions,
He is jolly, nimble, dexterous, cleanly, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous.
He loves eaſe, and chooſes the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and warmeſt ſituations for repoſe. He is
likewiſe extremely amorous, and, what is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in the animal world, the female ſeems to be
more ardent than the male. She not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
and goes in queſt of him, but announces,
by loud cries, the fury of her paſſion, or rather
the preſſure of her neceſſities; and, when the
male diſdains her, or flies from her, ſhe purſues,
tears, and, though their embraces are always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the moſt acute pain, compels
him to comply with her deſires. This paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
ardour of the female continues only nine or
ten days, and it happens generally twice a-year,
though often thrice, and even four times. The
period of geſtation is 55 or 56 days, and four or
five are commonly produced at a litter. As the
male has an inclination to devour the young, the
female carefully conceals them; and, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
of a diſcovery, ſhe takes them up, one
by one, in her mouth, and hides them in holes,
and in places which are inacceſſible. After ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them a few weeks, ſhe preſents them with
mice, or young birds, to learn them to eat fleſh.
But, by an unaccountable caprice, theſe ſame
careful, tender, and affectionate mothers, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0195500104:80"/>
aſſume an unnatural ſpecies of cruelty, and
devour their own offspring.</p>
               <p>Young cats are gay, vivacious, and frolick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and, if nothing was to be apprehended
from their claws, would afford excellent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to children. But their toying, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
light and agreeable, is never altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and is ſoon converted into habitual ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
As their talents can only be exerted with
advantage againſt ſmall animals, they lie in wait,
with great patience and perſeverance, to ſeize
birds, mice, and rats, and, without any inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
become more expert hunters than the beſt
trained dogs. Naturally averſe to every kind
of reſtraint, they are incapable of any ſyſtem of
education. It is related, however, that the Greek
Monks of the iſland of Cyprus had trained cats
to hunt and deſtroy ſerpents, with which that
iſland was much infeſted<note n="*" place="bottom">Deſcript. des iſles de l'Archipel, par Dapper, p. 51.</note>. But this hunting
muſt rather be aſcribed to their general deſire
of ſlaughter, than to any kind of tractability or
obedience; for they delight in watching, attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and deſtroying all weak animals indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
as birds, young rabbits, hares, rats, mice,
bats, moles, frogs, toads, lizards, and ſerpents.
They have not that docility and fineneſs of ſcent,
for which the dog is ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed.
They hunt only by the eye: Neither do they
properly purſue, but lie in wait, and attack ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
by ſurpriſe; and, after ſporting with them,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0195500104:81"/>
and tormenting them for a long time, they at
laſt kill them without any neceſſity, and even
when well fed, purely to gratify their ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
appetite.</p>
               <p>The moſt obvious phyſical cauſe of their
watching and catching other animals by ſurpriſe,
proceeds from the advantage they derive from
the peculiar ſtructure of their eyes. In man
and moſt other animals, the pupil is capable of a
certain degree of contraction and dilatation. It
enlarges a little when the light is faint, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
when the light is too ſplendid. But, in
cats and night birds, as the owls, &amp;c. the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
and dilatation are ſo great, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil,
which is round in the dark, becomes, when
expoſed to much light, long and narrow like a
line. Hence theſe animals ſee better in the
night than in the day. The pupil of the cat,
during the day, is perpetually contracted, and
it is only by a ſtrong effort that he can ſee with
a ſtrong light. But, in the twilight, the pupil
reſumes its natural roundneſs, the animal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
perfect viſion, and takes advantage of this
ſuperiority to diſcover and ſurpriſe his prey.</p>
               <p>Though cats live in our houſes, they are not
entirely domeſtic. Even the tameſt cats are not
under the ſmalleſt ſubjection, but may rather be
ſaid to enjoy perfect liberty; for they act only
to pleaſe themſelves; and it is impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them a moment after they chooſe to go off.
Beſides, moſt cats are half wild. They know
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0195500104:82"/>
not their maſters, and only frequent barns, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
or kitchens, when preſſed with hunger.</p>
               <p>Though greater numbers of them are reared
than of dogs, as they are ſeldom ſeen, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
makes leſs impreſſion on us. They contract
a ſtronger attachment to our houſes than to our
perſons. When carried to the diſtance of a
league or two, they return of their own accord,
probably becauſe they are acquainted with all
the retreats of the mice, and all the paſſages and
outlets of the houſe, and becauſe the labour of
returning is leſs than that which would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to acquire the ſame knowledge in a new
habitation. They have a natural antipathy at
water, cold, and bad ſmells. They are fond of
baſking in the ſun, and of lying in warm places.
They are alſo fond of perfumes, and willingly
allow themſelves to be taken and careſſed by
perſons who carry aromatic ſubſtances. They
are ſo delighted with valerian root, that it ſeems
to throw them into a tranſport of pleaſure. To
preſerve this plant in our gardens, we are under
the neceſſity of fencing it round with a rail; for
the cats ſmell it at a diſtance, collect about it in
numbers, and, by frequently rubbing, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and repaſſing over it, they ſoon deſtroy the
plant.</p>
               <p>Cats require fifteen or eighteen months before
they come to their full growth. In leſs than a
year, they are capable of procreating, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this faculty during life, which extends not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0195500104:83"/>
beyond nine or ten years. They are, however,
extremely hardy and vivacious, and are more
nervous than other animals which live longer.</p>
               <p>Cats eat ſlowly, and with difficulty: Their
teeth are ſo ſhort and ill placed, that they can
tear, but not grind their food. Hence they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
prefer the moſt tender victuals, as fiſhes,
which they devour either raw or boiled. They
drink frequently; their ſleep is light; and they
often aſſume the appearance of ſleeping, when
they are only meditating miſchief. They walk
ſoftly, and without making any noiſe. As their
hair is always clean and dry, it is eaſily electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and the ſparks become viſible when it is
rubbed acroſs with the hand in the dark. Their
eyes alſo ſparkle in the dark like diamonds, and
ſeem to throw out, in the night, the light they
imbibe during the day.</p>
               <p>The wild cat couples with the domeſtic kind;
and, conſequently, they belong to the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
It is not uncommon to ſee both males and
females quit their houſes in the ſeaſon of love,
go to the woods in queſt of wild cats, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
return to their former habitations. It is
for this reaſon that ſome domeſtic cats ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
reſemble the wild cat. The only real dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is internal; for the inteſtines of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
cat are commonly much longer than thoſe
of the wild cat. The latter, however, is larger
and ſtronger than the domeſtic kind; his lips
are always black; his ears are alſo ſtiffer; his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0195500104:84"/>
tail larger, and his colours more conſtant. In
this climate there is only one ſpecies of wild
cat; and it appears from the teſtimony of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
that this kind is found in all climates,
without being ſubject to much variety. They
exiſted in America before its diſcovery by the
Europeans. A hunter brought one of them to
Chriſtopher Columbus<note n="*" place="bottom">Vie de Chriſt. Columb. part. 2. p. 167.</note>, which was of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſize, of a browniſh grey colour, and having
a very long and ſtrong tail. They were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
found in Peru<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 121.</note>, though not in a domeſtic
ſtate, and alſo in Canada<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt. de Nouvelle France, par Charlevoix, tom. 3. p. 407.</note>, in the country of the
Illinois, &amp;c. They have been ſeen in many
places of Africa, as in Guiney<note n="‖" place="bottom">Prevot, tom. 4. p. 230.</note>, and the Gold
Coaſt; at Madagaſcar<note n="§" place="bottom">Relation de Francois Cauche, p. 225.</note>, where the natives keep
them in a domeſtic ſtate; and at the Cape of
Good Hope<note n="**" place="bottom">Deſcript. du Cap. par Kolbe, p. 49.</note>, where M. Kolbe ſays there is
likewiſe a wild kind, of a blue colour; but they
are not numerous. Theſe blue, or rather ſlate
coloured cats, are alſo found in Aſia. 'In Perſia,'
ſays Pietro della Valle<note n="††" place="bottom">Voyage, tom. 5. p. 98.</note>, 'there is a ſpecies of
cats which properly belong to the province of
Chorazan. Their figure and ſize are the ſame
with thoſe of the common cat. Their beauty
conſiſts in the colour of their hair, which is
grey, and uniformly the ſame over the whole
body, excepting that it is darker on the back
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0195500104:85"/>
and head, and clearer on the breaſt and belly,
where it approaches to whiteneſs, with that
agreeable mixture of clare-obſcure, to uſe the
language of the painters, which has always a
wonderful effect. Beſides, their hair is fine,
ſhining, ſoft as ſilk, and ſo long, that, though
not frizled, it forms ringlets in ſome parts,
and particularly under the throat. Theſe cats
are among other cats, what the water-dog is
among other dogs. The moſt beautiful part
of the body is the tail, which is very long, and
covered with hair five or ſix inches in length.
They extend and turn it upon their backs,
like the ſquirrel, the point reſembling a
plume of feathers. They are very tame; and
the Portugueſe have brought them from Perſia
into India.' The ſame author adds, that he
had four couple of theſe cats, which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bring to Italy. From this deſcription it
appears, that the Perſian cats reſemble, in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
thoſe we call Chartreux cats, and that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
in colour, they have a perfect reſemblance
to the cat of Angora. It is probable, therefore,
that the cat of Chorazan in Perſia, the cat of
Angora in Syria, and the Chartreux cat, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
but one race, whoſe beauty proceeds from the
particular influence of the climate, as the Spaniſh
cats, which are red, black, and white, owe their
beauty to the climate of Spain. It may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
in general, that, of all climates on the
habitable parts of the globe, thoſe of Spain and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0195500104:86"/>
Syria are moſt favourable to the production of
beautiful varieties in natural objects. In Spain
and Syria, the ſheep, the goats, the dogs, the
cats, the rabbits, &amp;c. have the fineſt wool, the
moſt beautiful and longeſt hair, and the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
and variegated colours. Theſe climates,
it would appear, ſoften Nature, and embelliſh
the form of all animals.</p>
               <p>The wild cat, like moſt other animals in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
ſtate, has coarſe colours, and hard hair.
But, when rendered domeſtic, the hair ſoftens,
the colours vary; and, in the favourable climates
of Chorazan and Syria, the hair grows long,
fine, and buſhy; all the colours become more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate;
the black and red change into a ſhining
brown, and the greyiſh brown is converted into
an aſh-coloured grey. By comparing the wild
cat with the Chartreux cat, it will be found,
that they differ only in this degradation in the
ſhades of colour. As theſe animals have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
more or leſs whiteneſs on the ſides and
belly, it is apparent, that, to produce cats entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
white and with long hair, like the cats of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gora,
nothing farther is requiſite, than to join
thoſe which have the greateſt quantity of white,
as has been done to procure white rabbits, dogs,
goats, ſtags, &amp;c. In the Spaniſh cat, which is
only another variety of the wild kind, the colours,
inſtead of being weakened by uniform ſhades,
as in the cat of Syria, are exalted, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more lively and brilliant; the yellow is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0195500104:87"/>
changed into red, the brown into black, and the
grey into white. Theſe cats, though tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into America, have not degenerated, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their beautiful colours. 'In the Antilles,'
ſays Father Tertre, 'there are a number of cats,
which have probably been brought from Spain.
They are moſtly marked with red, white, and
black. Several of our countrymen, after eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fleſh, carry the ſkins of theſe cats into
France. When we firſt arrived at Guadaloupe,
the cats were ſo accuſtomed to feed on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges,
pigeons, thruſhes, and other ſmall
birds, that they diſdained the rats; but, when
the game was much diminiſhed, they attacked
the rats with great fury<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. des Antilles, par. le. P. du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 306.</note>,' &amp;c. In general,
cats are not ſubject, like dogs, to degeneration,
when tranſported into warm climates. 'The
European cats,' Boſman remarks, 'when car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to Guiney, change not, like the dogs, but
preſerve their original figure<note n="†" place="bottom">Voyage de Guinée, par Boſman, p. 2403.</note>,' &amp;c. Their
nature is indeed more conſtant; and, as their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
ſtate is neither ſo complete, ſo univerſal,
nor, perhaps, ſo antient as that of the dog, it is
not ſurpriſing that they are alſo leſs variegated.
Our domeſtic cats, though they differ in colour,
form no diſtinct races. The climates of Spain
and Syria have alone produced permanent varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
To theſe may be added the climate of
Pe-chi-ly in China, where the cats have long
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0195500104:88"/>
hair and pendulous ears, and are the favourites
of the ladies<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. des voyages, par M. l'Abbé Prevot, tom. 6. p. 10.</note>. Theſe domeſtic cats with pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
ears, of which we have full deſcriptions,
are ſtill farther removed from the wild and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
race, than thoſe whoſe ears are erect.</p>
               <p>We ſhall here terminate the hiſtory of the cat,
and at the ſame time that of domeſtic animals.
The horſe, the aſs, the ox, the ſheep, the goat,
the hog, the dog, and the cat, are our only do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
animals. We add not to this liſt, the
camel, elephant, rain-deer, &amp;c. which, though
domeſtic in other countries, are ſtrangers to us;
and we ſhall not treat of foreign animals, till
we have given the hiſtory of the wild animals
which are natives of our own climate. Beſides,
as the cat may be conſidered as only half-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic,
he forms the ſhade between domeſtic and
wild animals; for we ought not to rank among
domeſtics thoſe troubleſome neighbours, mice,
rats, and moles, which, though they inhabit our
houſes and gardens, are perfectly wild and free.
Inſtead of being attached or ſubmiſſive to man,
they fly from him, and preſerve entire, in their
obſcure retreats, their manners, their habits, and
their liberty.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen, in the hiſtory of each domeſtic
animal, the great influence which education,
ſhelter, and the careful hand of man, have upon
the manners, diſpoſitions, and even the form of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0195500104:89"/>
animals. We have ſeen, that theſe cauſes, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the effects of climate, modify and change
the ſpecies to ſuch a degree, as to make them
very different from what they are in a natural
ſtate, and, at the ſame time, introduce ſuch
changes among individuals of the ſame ſpecies,
that they would be regarded as different animals,
if they preſerved not the faculty of intermixing
and producing fertile individuals, which is the
only eſſential characteriſtic of ſpecies. We have
ſeen, that the different races of domeſtic ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
obſerve, in different climates, nearly the
ſame order as the races of the human kind;
that, like men, they are ſtronger, larger, and
more courageous in cold countries, milder and
more civilized in temperate climates, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more deformed in very warm regions;
and that, in temperate climates, and among po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
people, the varieties of each ſpecies are
moſt numerous and diverſified, and exhibit the
moſt evident marks of the antiquity of their ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very:
Pendulous ears, variegated colours, fine
long hair, are effects produced by their long
continuance in a domeſtic ſtate. Moſt wild a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
have erect ears. The ears of the wild
boar are erect and ſtiff; but thoſe of the dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic
hog are inclined and half-pendulous. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Laplanders, the ſavages of America,
the Hottentots, the Negroes, and other unpoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
people, all the dogs have erect ears; but they
are generally ſoft and pendulous in Spain, France,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0195500104:90"/>
Britain, Turkey, Perſia, China, and other civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
nations. The ears of the domeſtic cat are
not ſo ſtiff and erect as thoſe of the wild kind;
and in China, a nation which has been very long
in a ſtate of civilization, and whoſe climate is
mild, there are cats with pendulous ears. It is
for this reaſon, that the goat of Angora, whoſe
ears are pendulous, ſhould be regarded as a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
fartheſt removed from the natural ſtate.
The ſtrong and marked influence of the climate
of Syria, joined to the domeſtic condition of
theſe animals among a people very antiently
civilized, would, in the progreſs of time, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this variety, which cannot be preſerved in
any other climate. In the goats of Angora,
brought forth in France, the ears are neither ſo
long nor ſo pendulous as in thoſe of Syria, and
would probably, after a certain number of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
reſume the ears and coarſe hair of our
common goat.</p>

                  <p>By miſtaking ſome of my expreſſions in the
above hiſtory of the cat, I find it has been ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that I had denied him the power of ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether. I always knew that cats ſlept,
but not ſo profoundly as I now find they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
do. On this ſubject M. Paſumot, of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0195500104:91"/>
academy of Dijon, an able naturaliſt, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to me a letter, of which the following is
an extract.</p>
                  <p>'Permit me, Sir, to remark, that, in your
work, you ſeem to deny the cat the power of
ſleeping. I aſſure you, that, though he ſleeps
ſeldom, his ſleep is ſo profound, that it is a
ſpecies of lethargy, which I have obſerved at
leaſt ten times in different cats. When young,
a favourite cat lay every night in bed at my
feet. One night, I puſhed him from me; but
I was ſurpriſed to find him ſo heavy, and at
the ſame time ſo immoveable, that I believed
him to be dead. I pulled him ſmartly with
my hand; but I felt no motion. I then toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him about, and, by the force of the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he began ſlowly to awake. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſleep, and difficulty of wakening, I have
frequently obſerved. It generally happened in
the night, having only once obſerved it in the
day; and this was after peruſing what you have
ſaid concerning the ſleep of theſe animals. I
know another gentleman who has likewiſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſeen cats ſleeping in this profound manner.
He tells me, that, when cats ſleep during the
day, it is always at the time of the greateſt
heat, and particularly before the approach of
ſtormy weather.'</p>
                  <p>M. de Leſtrée, a merchant of Chalons in
Champagne, who is accuſtomed to allow cats to
lie in his bed, remarks:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0195500104:92"/>
1. 'That, when theſe animals purr, when
they are tranquil, and appear to be ſleeping,
they ſometimes make a long inſpiration, which
is followed by a ſtrong expiration; and that,
at this period, their breath has an odour which
greatly reſembles that of muſk.'</p>
                  <p>2. 'That, when ſurpriſed by a dog, or any
other object which ſuddenly alarms them, they
make a kind of hiſſing noiſe, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the ſame odour. This is not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the males; for I have remarked the
ſame thing of both ſexes, and of cats of all ages
and colours.'</p>
                  <p>From theſe facts, M. de Leſtrée ſeems to think,
that, in the breaſt or ſtomach of the cat, there
are ſome veſſels filled with an aromatic ſubſtance,
the perfume of which iſſues from the mouth.
But we diſcover nothing of this kind from ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy.</p>
                  <p>I formerly remarked, that, in China, there
were cats with pendulous ears. This variety is
not found any where elſe, and perhaps it is an
animal of a different ſpecies; for travellers, when
mentioning an animal called <hi>Sumxu,</hi> which is
entirely domeſtic, ſay, that they can compare it
to nothing but the cat, with which it has a great
reſemblance. Its colour is black or yellow, and
its hair very bright and glittering. The Chineſe
put ſilver collars about the necks of theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and render them extremely familiar. As
they are not common, they give a high price,

                  <p>At Madagaſcar there are alſo wild cats ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
domeſtic. Moſt of them have twiſted
tails; and they are called <hi>Saca</hi> by the natives.
But theſe wild cats are of the ſame ſpecies with
the domeſtic kind; for they intermix and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce<note n="‡" place="bottom">Voy. de Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, p. 152.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Another variety has been obſerved. In our
own climate, cats are ſometimes produced with
pencils of hair at the points of their ears. M.
de Seve writes me, (Nov. 16. 1773), that a young
cat was brought forth in his houſe at Paris, of
the ſame race with that we have called the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
cat,</hi> with pencils at the points of its ears,
though neither of the parents had any pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.
In a few months, the pencils of this cat
were as large, in proportion to its ſize, as thoſe
of the Canadian lynx.</p>
                  <p>The ſkin of an animal, which greatly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
that of our wild cat, has been lately ſent me
from Cayenne. It is called <hi>Haïra</hi> in Guiana,
where they eat its fleſh, which is white and
good; and hence we may preſume, that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſimilar to the cat, it belongs to a different
ſpecies. But, perhaps, the name <hi>haïra</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
applied; for it is probably the ſame
with <hi>taïra,</hi> which is not a cat, but a ſmall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
taken notice of in the laſt volume of this
work.</p>

               <head>OF WILD ANIMALS.</head>
               <p>IN the hiſtory of man, and of domeſtic animals,
we have ſeen Nature under reſtraint, ſeldom
perſect, often changed and deformed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
encompaſſed with fetters, or loaded with
foreign ornaments. She is now to appear na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and adorned with ſimplicity alone; but
her attractions will be heightened by native beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by the freedom of her demeanour, the ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of her movements, and other marks of
true dignity and independence. We are to ſee
her traverſing the ſurface of the earth, like a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
dividing her empire among the animals,
aſſigning to each his proper element, climate,
and ſubſiſtence. We ſhall ſurvey her in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
in the waters, and in the plains, dictating
her ſimple but immutable laws, impreſſing upon
every ſpecies indelible characters, diſpenſing her
bounty with equity, compenſating evil with
good, giving to ſome ſtrength and courage, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with hunger and voracity; to others
gentleneſs, temperance, and agility, attended
with reſtleſſneſs and timidity; and to all, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
uniform manners, and ardour in love, which
is always eaſily gratified, and always followed
with a happy fecundity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0195500104:100"/>
Love and liberty are the moſt ineſtimable gifts
which Nature has to beſtow. Do theſe animals
we call <hi>wild,</hi> becauſe they are not ſubject to our
caprice, require more to render them completely
happy? But they alſo enjoy a perfect equality;
they are neither the ſlaves nor the tyrants of each
other. The individual has no occaſion, like
man, to dread the reſt of his ſpecies. They have
peace among themſelves, and war never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
them, but from ſtrangers, or from man.
They have, therefore, great reaſon to fly from
the human race, to conceal themſelves from our
obſervation, to take up their abode in ſolitudes
remote from the habitations of men, to provide
for their ſafety by all the reſources afforded them
by inſtinct, and to withdraw themſelves from
the power of man, uſing, in every manner, that
liberty beſtowed on them by Nature, at the ſame
time that ſhe has given them the deſire of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.</p>
               <p>Some animals, and they are the moſt gentle,
innocent, and tranquil, content themſelves with
retiring, and paſſing their lives in our fields.
Thoſe which are more fierce and ſuſpicious, hide
themſelves in the deepeſt receſſes of the foreſt.
Others, as if they knew there was no ſafety on
the ſurface of the earth, dig ſubterraneous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodes,
take refuge in caverns, or gain the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of the moſt inacceſſible mountains. Laſtly,
the moſt ferocious and formidable kinds, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
only deſerts, and reign as monarchs in thoſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0195500104:101"/>
burning climates, where man, equally ſavage as
themſelves, is unable to conquer them.</p>
               <p>As all beings, however free, are ſubjected to
phyſical laws, and as the brute animals, as well
as man, feel the influences of the heavens and
the earth, it appears, that the ſame cauſes which
have ſoftened and civilized the human ſpecies in
our climates, have produced ſimilar effects upon
every other ſpecies. The wolf, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the moſt ferocious animal in the Temperate
Zone, is not nearly ſo terrible or ſo cruel as the
tiger, the panther, and the lion of the Torrid
Zone, or the white bear, the lynx, and the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aena
of the Frozen Zone. This difference, as
if Nature, to give more harmony to her produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
had adapted the climate to the ſpecies,
or the ſpecies to the climate, is not only general,
but, in each particular ſpecies, the climate is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the manners, and the manners for the
climate.</p>
               <p>In America, where the heat, under the ſame
latitudes, is leſs, and the air and earth ſofter than
in Africa, the tiger, the lion, the panther, have
nothing formidable but the name. They are no
longer thoſe tyrants of the foreſt, thoſe bold and
intrepid enemies of man, thoſe rapacious mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
which perpetually thirſt for blood and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.
Theſe animals, in America, generally fly
from man, and attack not other wilds beaſts with
open force, but lie in wait to ſurpriſe them:
They may even be ſubdued, and almoſt tamed.
Hence, if ferociouſneſs and cruelty were natural
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0195500104:102"/>
to them, they muſt have degenerated, or rather
felt the influence of climate. Under a mild cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
their nature has been ſoftened; every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of temper has been moderated; and thoſe
changes have only rendered them more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the quality of the country they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit.</p>
               <p>The vegetables which cover the earth, and are
more cloſely connected with it than the animal
that feeds upon them, participate alſo more of
the nature of the climate. Every country, every
degree of temperature, has its peculiar plants.
At the foot of the Alps, we find the vegetables
of France and Italy, and, on their ſummit, thoſe
of the northern regions: We even meet with the
ſame plants on the frozen ridges of the African
mountains. On the ſouth ſide of the mountains
which divide the Mogul empire from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Caſhmire, we ſee all the Indian plants,
and we are ſurpriſed to find, on the oppoſite ſide,
nothing but the European kinds. Intemperate
climates likewiſe produce drugs, perfumes, poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and all vegetables whoſe qualities are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exalted. The productions of temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
on the contrary, are always mild: The
ſofteſt and moſt wholeſome herbs, the ſweeteſt
fruits, the gentleſt animals, and the moſt poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, are peculiar to thoſe happy climates.
Thus, the earth produces plants, the earth and
plants make animals, and the earth, plants, and
animals, give birth to man; for the qualities of
vegetables proceed immediately from the earth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0195500104:103"/>
and the air; the temperature and other relative
qualities of herbivorous animals are derived from
the plants upon which they feed; and the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
qualities of man, and other creatures which
are nouriſhed partly by fleſh and partly by plants,
depend, though more remotely, on the ſame
cauſes, whoſe influence extends even to diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
and manners. Figure and ſize, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be abſolute and determined qualities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
however, like the relative qualities, upon
the influence of climate, and concur in proving
that every thing is moderate in temperate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.
The ſize of our largeſt quadrupeds have no
proportion to that of the elephant, the rhinoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros,
or hyppopotamus. Our largeſt birds are
ſmall, when compared with the oſtrich, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
or the caſſawary; and what compariſon is
there between the fiſhes, the lizards, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
of our climates, with the whale, the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
and manati, which people the northern ſeas,
or the crocodiles, the large lizards, and the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
ſerpents which infeſt the land and waters
of the ſouth? And, if we examine each ſpecies
in different climates, we ſhall find ſenſible vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
both in ſize and in figure<note n="*" place="bottom">See the hiſtory of the horſe, vol. III. p. 306.; goat, vol. III. p. 406.; hog, vol. III. p. 500.; and dog, vol. IV. p. 1.</note>. Theſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are produced in a ſlow and imperceptible
manner. Time is the great workman of nature.
He moves with regular and uniform ſteps. He
performs no operation ſuddenly; but, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0195500104:104"/>
or ſucceſſive impreſſions, nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
his power; and thoſe changes which at firſt
are imperceptible, become gradually ſenſible, and
at laſt are marked by reſults too conſpicuous to
be miſapprehended.</p>
               <p>Wild and free animals, without excepting
man, are, of all animated beings, leaſt ſubject to
changes or variations of any kind. As they are
at abſolute liberty in the choice of their food and
their climate, their nature is more permanent
than that of domeſtic animals, which are enſlaved,
tranſported, maletreated, and fed, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
their inclination or taſte. Wild animals
live perpetually in the ſame manner. They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wander from climate to climate. The wood
where they are brought forth is a country to
which they are faithfully attached, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
depart from it, unleſs they perceive that they
can no longer live there in ſafety. They fly not
ſo much from their natural enemies, as from the
preſence of man. Nature has furniſhed them
with reſources againſt the other animals, and put
them on a level; they know their ſtrength, their
addreſs, their deſigns, their haunts, and, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to avoid them, oppoſe force to force: In a
word, they are ſpecies of the ſame genus. But
how can they defend themſelves againſt a being
who can ſeize without ſeeing, and kill without
approaching them?</p>
               <p>It is man, therefore, who diſturbs and diſperſes
wild animals, and renders them a thouſand more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0195500104:105"/>
ſavage than they would naturally be; for moſt
of them require only tranquility, and a moderate
uſe of the air and earth. Nature even teaches
them to live together, to unite into families, and
to form ſocieties. In countries not totally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed
by man, ſome veſtiges of theſe ſocieties
ſtill remain. We there perceive common works
carried on, deſigns that, though not founded on
reaſon, appear to be projected upon rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
the execution of which ſuppoſes union
at leaſt, and a joint co-operation of labour. It is
not by force or phyſical neceſſity, like the ants,
the bees, &amp;c. that the beavers labour and build
houſes; for they are neither conſtrained by ſpace,
nor time, nor number, but unite from choice. Thoſe
which agree, dwell together; and thoſe which do
not agree, remove; and ſome of them have been
remarked which, being conſtantly repulſed by
others, were obliged to betake themſelves to a
ſolitary life. It is only in diſtant and deſert
countries, where they dread not the approach of
man, that they incline to render their dwellings
more fixed and commodious, by conſtructing
houſes, or a kind of villages, which have no
ſmall reſemblance to the feeble and primitive ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of a naſcent republic. In countries, on
the contrary, ſpread over by men, they carry
terror along with them. The ſociety of animals
is then at an end. All induſtry ceaſes, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
art is ſtifled. They think no more of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and neglect every conveniency. Perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0195500104:106"/>
preſſed by fear and neceſſity, their only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
is the bare preſervation of life, and their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occupation is flight and concealment. If the
human ſpecies, as is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, ſhall,
in the progreſs of time, people equally the whole
ſurface of the earth, the hiſtory of the beaver, in
a few ages, will be regarded as a ridiculous
fable.</p>
               <p>We may, therefore, conclude, that the talents
and faculties of animals, inſtead of augmenting,
are perpetually diminiſhing. Time fights againſt
them. The more the human ſpecies multiplies
and improves, the more will the wild animals
feel the effects of a terrible and abſolute tyrant,
who, hardly allowing them an individual exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
deprives them of liberty, of every aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
principle, and deſtroys the very rudiments of
their intelligence. What advances they have
made, or may ſtill make, conveys little informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what they have been, or might acquire.
If the human ſpecies were annihilated, to which
of the animals would the ſceptre of the earth
belong?</p>

               <p>THE ſtag is one of thoſe innocent, gentle,
and peaceable animals, which ſeem to be
deſtined to embelliſh and animate the ſolitudes
of the foreſt, and to occupy, at a diſtance from
man, the tranquil retreats of thoſe gardens
of nature. The elegance and lightneſs of his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0195500104:108"/>
figure, the commodiouſneſs of his ſtature, the
flexibility and nervouſneſs of his limbs, his gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
ſtrength, and ſwiftneſs, and his head, which
is rather adorned than armed with living bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that, like the leaves of trees, are annually
renewed, ſufficiently diſtinguiſh him from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inhabitants of the wood. As he is alſo the
nobleſt of theſe animals, he miniſters to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and has occupied the leiſure, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
heroes. The exerciſe of the chace ſhould
always ſucceed, or rather precede, the fatigues
of war. To know the management of horſes
and arms, are talents common to the warrior
and the hunter. To be accuſtomed to fatigue,
addreſs, dexterity, and quickneſs of movement,
ſo neceſſary for the ſupport of courage, are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
acquired in the chace, and extremely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in battle. Hunting is a moſt delightful
ſchool of a neceſſary art. It is the only amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which entirely diveſts us of care, the only
recreation that is not accompanied with effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
and gives vivacity and pleaſure, without
languor or diſguſt.</p>
               <p>How can men, who, from their ſituation in
life, are perpetually harraſſed with company, be
better employed than in hunting? Always ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with a multitude, teaſed with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of their demands, obliged to give their
attention to affairs which are foreign to them,
agitated by the ſolicitations of men of high rank,
and conſtrained and fettered in proportion to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0195500104:109"/>
their elevation, great men would feel only the
weight of their own grandeur, and exiſt only
for others, if they did not occaſionally abſtract
themſelves from a croud of paraſites and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
To preſerve ſelf-enjoyment, to recal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
attachments, and receive private friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
ſentiments a thouſand times more precious
and intereſting than all the ideas of grandeur,
retirement from the tumult and buſineſs of the
world is ſometimes neceſſary; and what retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can be more various and animated than the
chace? what exerciſe more uſeful to the body?
what amuſement more agreeable to the mind?</p>
               <p>Perpetual action, or intercourſe with man, is
equally painful as perpetual thinking. Nature
never intended man for the contemplation of
abſtract ſubjects. To be occupied, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation,
in difficult ſtudies, to lead a ſedentary
life, and to make the cloſet the centre of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
is equally unnatural as to paſs our days
in tumult and agitation, continually drawn along
by the movements of other men, and obliged to
keep a jealous and conſtrained watch over our
own conduct, looks, and geſtures. Whatever
ideas we may conceive of the dignity of human
nature, it is apparent, that public exhibition is
not exiſtence, and that we are leſs fitted for
thinking than for action, for reaſoning than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment.
True pleaſure conſiſts in the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
uſe of ourſelves. Our beſt gifts are
thoſe we receive from Nature. She preſents us
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0195500104:110"/>
with the uſeful and inexhauſtible enjoyments
which ariſe from the air, the earth, the fields,
and the foreſts. Hence a taſte for hunting,
fiſhing, gardening, and agriculture, is natural to
all men: And, in ſocieties leſs complicated than
ours, there are only two ranks, both of them
connected with this mode of life; the Nobles,
whoſe buſineſs is arms and hunting; and the
Vulgar, who are occupied in cultivating the
earth.</p>
               <p>In poliſhed ſocieties, where every thing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
and brought nearer perfection, to render
hunting more delightful and ſprightly, to ennoble
this moſt beneficial and reſpectable of all exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
it has been formed into an art. The chace
of the ſtag requires a ſpecies of knowledge,
which can only be learned by experience: It
implies a royal aſſemblage of men, horſes, and
dogs, all ſo trained, practiſed, and diſciplined,
that their movements, their reſearches, and their
ſkill, muſt concur in producing one common
end. The huntſman ſhould know the age and
the ſex of the animal; he ſhould be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh

as the young ones; but in this they are more
regular than the hind or young ſtag, placing the
hind foot always at the ſide of the fore foot,
and never beyond or within it.</p>
               <p>When the huntſman, from the dryneſs of the
ſeaſon, or other circumſtances, cannot judge by
the foot, he is obliged to trace the animal back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and endeavour to find his dung. This
mark requires, perhaps, greater experience than
the knowledge of the foot; but, without it, the
huntſman would be unable to give a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to the company. After the report of the
huntſman, and the dogs are led to the refuge of the
ſtag, he ought to encourage his hound, and make
him reſt upon the track of the ſtag till the animal
be unharboured. Inſtantly the alarm is given to
uncouple the dogs, which ought to be enlivened
by the voice and the horn of the huntſman. He
ſhould alſo diligently obſerve the foot of the ſtag,
in order to diſcover whether the animal has
ſtarted, and ſubſtituted another in his place. But
it is then the buſineſs of the hunters to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
alſo, and to recall the dogs which have gone
aſtray after falſe game. The huntſman ſhould
always accompany his dogs, and encourage, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preſſing them too hard. He ſhould aſſiſt
them in detecting all the arts of eſcape uſed
by the ſtag; for this animal has remarkable
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0195500104:113"/>
addreſs in deceiving the dogs. With this view,
he often returns twice or thrice upon his former
ſteps; he endeavours to raiſe hinds or younger
ſtags to accompany him, and draw off the dogs
from the object of their purſuit: He then flies
with redoubled ſpeed, or ſprings off at ſide, lies
down on his belly, and conceals himſelf. In
this caſe, when the dogs have loſt his foot, the
huntſmen, by going backwards and forwards,
aſſiſt them in recovering it. But, if they cannot
find it, they ſuppoſe that he is reſting within
the circuit they have made, and go in queſt of
him. But, if they are ſtill unable to diſcover him,
there is no other method left, but, from view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the country, to conjecture where he may
have taken refuge, and repair to the place. As
ſoon as they have recovered his foot, and put the
dogs upon the track, they purſue with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
becauſe they perceive that the ſtag is
fatigued. Their ardour augments in proportion
to his feebleneſs; and their ſcent becomes more
diſtinct as the animal grows warm. Hence they
redouble their cries and their ſpeed; and, though
the ſtag practiſes ſtill more arts of eſcape than
formerly, as his ſwiftneſs is diminiſhed, his arts
and doublings become gradually leſs effectual.
He has now no other reſource but to fly from
the earth which he treads, and get into the waters,
in order to cut off the ſcent from the dogs. The
huntſmen go round theſe waters, and again put
the dogs on the track of his foot. The ſtag, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0195500104:114"/>
taking to the water, is incapable of running
far, and is ſoon <hi>at bay</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">When a ſtag is worn out with fatigue, he turns upon the hounds, and is ſaid to be <hi>at bay.</hi>
                  </note> But he ſtill attempts
to defend his life, and often wounds the dogs,
and even the huntſmen when too forward, by
blows with his horns, till one of them cuts his
hams to make him fall, and then puts an end to
his life by a blow of a hanger. They now ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
the death of the ſtag by a flouriſh of their
horns; the dogs are allowed to trample upon
him, and at laſt partake richly of the victory by
devouring his fleſh.</p>
               <p>Every ſeaſon is not equally proper for hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſtag with hounds. In ſpring, when the
leaves begin to unfold and to adorn the foreſts,
when the earth is covered with freſh herbage
and flowers, their perfumes diminiſh the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the dogs; and, as the ſtag is then in his
greateſt vigour, it is extremely difficult for them
to come up with him. It is likewiſe a ſettled
point among hunters, that, when the hinds are
about to bring forth, the chace is moſt difficult,
and that, at this period, the dogs often quit a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued
ſtag, and purſue any hind which bounds
before them. In the ſame manner, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of autumn, when the rutting ſeaſon commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the hounds hunt without ardour: The ſtrong
odour of love renders, perhaps, the ſcent more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſting;
and, perhaps, at this ſeaſon, the odour
of all ſtags is nearly the ſame. During the winter
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0195500104:115"/>
ſnows, it is alſo improper to hunt the ſtag; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the hounds have no acuteneſs of ſcent, and
ſeem to purſue the foot rather by the eye than
the noſe. As, in this ſeaſon, the ſtags find not
ſufficient nouriſhment in their retreats, they iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
forth into the more open parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and even into the ſown fields. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
in flocks in the month of December, and,
when the froſts are ſevere, they ſeek ſhelter on
the ſea-coaſts, or in covered places, where they
lock themſelves faſt together, and acquire warmth
by mutual reſpiration. When the rigours of
winter decline, they frequent the borders of the
foreſt, and make depredations on the riſing
wheat. In ſpring, they ſhed their horns, which
fall off ſpontaneouſly, or by rubbing them gently
againſt the branches of trees. It is ſeldom that
both horns fall off at the ſame time, the one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
preceding the other a day or two. The
old ſtags caſt their horns firſt, which happens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the end of February or beginning of March.
An aged ſtag, or one in his ſeventh year or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
does not caſt his horns before the middle
of March; a ſtag of ſix years ſheds his horns
in April; young ſtags, or thoſe from three to
five years old, ſhed their horns in the beginning,
and thoſe which are in their ſecond year, not till
the middle or end of May. But, in all this there
is much variety; for old ſtags ſometimes caſt
their horns ſooner than thoſe which are young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Beſides, the ſhedding of the horns is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0195500104:116"/>
by a mild, and retarded by a ſevere and
long winter.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the ſtags caſt their horns, they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from each other, the young ones only
keeping together. They no longer haunt the
deepeſt receſſes of the foreſt, but advance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the cultivated country, and remain among
bruſhwood during the ſummer, till their horns
are renewed. In this ſeaſon, they walk with
their heads low to prevent their horns from
rubbing againſt the branches; for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to have ſenſibility till they acquire their
full growth. The horns of the oldeſt ſtags are
not half completed in the middle of May, and
acquire their full length and hardneſs before the
end of July. Thoſe of the younger ſtags are
proportionally later both in ſhedding and being
renewed. But, as ſoon as they have acquired
their full dimenſions and ſolidity, the ſtags rub
them againſt the trees, in order to clear them of
a ſkin with which they are covered: And, as
they continue this friction for ſeveral days ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively,
it is ſaid<note n="*" place="bottom">Le nouveau traité de la venerie, p. 27.</note>, that the horns retain the
colour peculiar to the juices of the trees againſt
which they have been rubbed; that they become
red when rubbed againſt beeches and birches,
brown againſt oaks, and black againſt elms and
trembling poplars. It is likewiſe ſaid, that the
horns of young ſtags, which are ſmoother, take
not ſo deep a tincture from the trees as thoſe of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0195500104:117"/>
old ſtags, which are rougher, and cloſer cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with little prominences; becauſe it is thoſe
prominences which retain the coloured juices of
the trees. But I cannot believe that this is the
true cauſe; for I have kept tamed ſtags in an
incloſure where there was not a ſingle tree, and
yet their horns were coloured in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as in thoſe which inhabit the foreſts.</p>
               <p>Soon after the ſtags have poliſhed their horns,
they begin to feel the impreſſions of love. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of Auguſt or beginning of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,
they leave the coppice, return to the
foreſts, and ſearch for the hinds. They cry with
a loud voice; their neck and throat ſwell; they
become perfectly reſtleſs, and traverſe, in open
day, the fields and the fallow grounds; they
ſtrike their horns againſt trees and hedges; in a
word, they ſeem to be tranſported with fury, and
run from country to country till they find the
hinds or females, whom they purſue and compel
into compliance; for the female at firſt avoids
and flies from the male, and never ſubmits to his
embraces till ſhe be fatigued with the purſuit.
The old hinds likewiſe come in ſeaſon before the
younger ones. When two ſtags approach the
ſame hind, they muſt fight before they enjoy.
If nearly equal in ſtrength, they threaten, paw
the ground, ſet up terrible cries, and attack each
other with ſuch fury, that they often inflict mortal
wounds with the ſtrokes of their horns. The
combat never terminates but in the defeat or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0195500104:118"/>
flight of one of the rivals. The conqueror
loſes not a moment in enjoying his victory, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
another rival approaches, whom he is again
obliged to attack and repel. The oldeſt ſtags
are always maſters of the field; becauſe they are
ſtronger and more furious than the young ones,
who muſt wait patiently till their ſuperiors tire,
and quit their miſtreſſes. Sometimes, however,
the young ſtags accompliſh their purpoſes when
the old ones are fighting, and, after a haſty gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
fly off. The hinds prefer the old ſtags,
not becauſe they are moſt courageous, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are much more ardent. They are
likewiſe more inconſtant, having often ſeveral
females at a time; and, when a ſtag has but one
hind, his attachment to her does not continue
above a few days: He then leaves her, goes in
queſt of another, with whom he remains a ſtill
ſhorter time; and, in this manner, paſſes from
one to another, till he is perfectly exhauſted.</p>
               <p>This ardour of love laſts only three weeks,
during which the ſtags take very little food, and
neither ſleep nor reſt. Night and day, they are
either walking, running, fighting, or enjoying
the hinds. Hence, at the end of the rutting
ſeaſon, they are ſo meagre and exhauſted, that
they recover not their ſtrength for a conſiderable
time. They generally retire to the borders of
the foreſts, feed upon the cultivated fields, where
they find plenty of nouriſhment, and remain
there till their ſtrength is re-eſtabliſhed. The
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0195500104:119"/>
rutting ſeaſon of old ſtags commences about
the beginning, and ends about the 20th day
of September. In thoſe of ſix or ſeven years
old, it begins about the 10th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and concludes in the beginning of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
In young ſtags, or thoſe in their third,
fourth, or fifth year, it begins about the 20th of
September, and terminates about the 15th of
October; and, at the end of October, the rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is all over, excepting among the <hi>prickets,</hi> or
thoſe which have entered into their ſecond year;
becauſe they, like the young hinds, are lateſt of
coming into ſeaſon. Hence, at the beginning
of November, the ſeaſon of love is entirely finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and the ſtags, during this period of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and laſſitude, are eaſily hunted down. In
ſeaſons when acorns and other nuts are plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the ſtags ſoon recover their ſtrength, and a
ſecond rutting frequently happens at the end of
October; but it is of much ſhorter duration than
the firſt.</p>
               <p>In climates warmer than that of France, the
rutting time, like the ſeaſons, is more forward.
Ariſtotle informs us<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtot. Hiſt. animal. lib. 6. c. 29.</note>, that, in Greece, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences
in the beginning of Auguſt, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
about the end of September. The hinds
go with young eight months and ſome days,
and ſeldom produce more than one fawn. They
bring forth in May or the beginning of June,
and ſo anxiouſly conceal their fawns, that they
often expoſe themſelves to be chaced, with a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0195500104:120"/>
view to draw off the dogs, and afterwards return
to take care of their young. All hinds are not
fertile; for ſome of them never conceive. Theſe
barren hinds are groſſer and fatter than thoſe
which are prolific, and alſo come ſooneſt in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Some hinds are ſaid to have horns like
the ſtag, which is not altogether improbable.
The young are not called <hi>fawns</hi> or <hi>calves</hi> after
the ſixth month: The knobs of their horns then
begin to appear, and they take the name of
<hi>knobbers</hi> till their horns lengthen into <hi>ſpears,</hi> and
then they are called <hi>brocks</hi> or <hi>ſtaggards.</hi> During
the firſt ſeaſon, they never leave their mothers.
In winter, the ſtags and hinds, of all ages, keep
together in flocks, which are always more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
in proportion to the rigour of the ſeaſon.
They ſeparate in ſpring: The hinds retire to
bring forth; and, during this period, the flocks
conſiſt only of knobbers and young ſtags. In
general, the ſtags are inclined to aſſociate, and
nothing but fear or neceſſity obliges them to
diſperſe. The ſtag is capable of generating at
the age of eighteen months: Thoſe brought
forth during the ſpring of the preceding year,
cover the hinds in autumn; and it is preſume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that theſe embraces are prolific. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
circumſtances, however, may render this
opinion doubtful: The ſtags have not then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
above a half or two thirds of their growth,
which is not completed till the eighth year of
their age; and their horns continue to increaſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0195500104:121"/>
during the ſame period. But it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
that the fawn ſoon gathers ſtrength;
that, during the firſt, and even the ſecond year,
his growth is very quick; and that he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
a redundance of nouriſhment, becauſe his
horns are conſiderably long, which is the moſt
certain mark of ability to impregnate. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
that animals, in general, are not capable
of procreating till they have nearly acquired
their full growth. But thoſe which have fixed
ſeaſons for rutting or ſpawning, ſeem not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
this law. Fiſhes ſpawn and are prolific be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have attained a fourth, or even an
eighth part of their growth; and, among qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds,
thoſe which, like the deer-hind, have
determined ſeaſons for rutting, procreate earlier
than other animals.</p>
               <p>There are ſo many relations between the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
the production of the horns, the rutting,
and the generation of theſe animals, that, to have
a clear conception of the particular effects which
reſult from them, it is neceſſary to give a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
recapitulation of what I formerly advanced
on the ſubject of reproduction<note n="*" place="bottom">See above, vol. II. chap. 2. 3. 4.</note>. Generation
depends ſolely on a redundance of nouriſhment.
During the growth of an animal, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
moſt rapid in infancy, the nouriſhment is
entirely exhauſted in the extenſion and deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopement
of the body. Hence there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundance,
conſequently no production or ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0195500104:122"/>
of ſeminal fluid, and, of courſe, young ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
are incapable of procreation. But, when
they have attained the greateſt part of their
growth, the redundance of nouriſhment begins
to manifeſt itſelf by new productions. In man,
the beard, the hair, the prominency of the breaſts,
and the expanſion of the organs of generation,
appear at the age of puberty. In the brute cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
and particularly in the ſtag, this redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
produces effects ſtill more remarkable, as
the growth of the horns, the ſwelling of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
the turgidity of the neck and throat, the fat,
the rutting, &amp;c. And, as the growth of the ſtag
is at firſt very rapid, only a year paſſes before the
redundance of nouriſhment begins to ſhow itſelf
by the production of horns: If brought forth
in May, the rudiments of the horns appear in
the ſame month of the following year; and they
continue to lengthen and acquire ſolidity, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the quantity of nouriſhment taken by
the animal. About the end of Auguſt, they are
fully grown, and ſo denſe and inſenſible, that
the animal rubs them againſt the trees, in order
to deprive them of the ſkin or ſcurf with which
they are covered. At the ſame time, the fat,
which is likewiſe produced by the redundance of
nouriſhment, ceaſes to accumulate, and begins
to be determined toward the organs of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to excite in the ſtag that ardour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
which renders him perfectly furious. That
the production of horns, and the ſecretion of
ſemen depend on the ſame cauſe, is evident
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0195500104:123"/>
from this fact, that, when the organs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the ſecretion of ſemen are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by caſtration, the production of the horns
is likewiſe prevented; for, if this operation
is performed after the horns are ſhed, they
are never renewed; and if, on the contrary,
it is done when the horns are perfect, they
never fall off. In a word, after caſtration, the
animal remains during life in the ſame condition
it was before that operation. As it feels no
longer the ardour of rutting, the concomitant
ſymptoms likewiſe diſappear. There is no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
any accumulation of fat or ſuet, no more
turgidity of the neck and throat, and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the creature becomes more gentle and
tranquil. The parts cut off, therefore, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
not only for collecting the redundant
nouriſhment, but likewiſe for puſhing it to the
ſurface of the body in the form of fat, and
particularly to the top of the head, where it
gives riſe to the horns, and for giving vigour
and ſpirit to the animal. Caſtrated ſtags, it is
true, become fat; but they produce no horns;
their neck and throat never ſwell; and their fat
is never ſo highly exalted as that of entire ſtags,
which, in the rutting ſeaſon, have an odour ſo
ſtrong, as to be perceived at a great diſtance;
and their fleſh is ſo infected with it, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eatable,
offenſive to the ſmell, and putrifies in a
very ſhort time; while that of the caſtrated ſtag
may be preſerved freſh, and eat at all ſeaſons.
The difference between the horns of ſtags of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0195500104:124"/>
ſame age, of which ſome are thick, and others
thin and ſlender, which is ſolely owing to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of food, is another proof that the horns are
produced by redundant nouriſhment: For a ſtag
which inhabits a rich country, where he is not
diſturbed by dogs or men, but is allowed to feed
and ruminate in peace, will always have the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
wideſt, largeſt, and moſt branchy horns.
But thoſe which live in ſituations where they
can neither find repoſe nor a ſufficient quantity
of food, will have horns with few branches,
ſlender ſtems, and brow-antlers. Thus it is
eaſy to judge, by the horns of the ſtag, whether
he has lived in a rich and peaceful country, or
the oppoſite. Thoſe which are in bad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have been wounded, or much diſturbed by
hunting, are ſeldom fat, or have fine horns;
their rutting time is alſo later; and their horns
are neither ſo ſoon ſhed or renewed. Hence
every circumſtance concurs in demonſtrating
that the horns, like the ſeminal fluid, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the redundant and ſuperfluous organic
nouriſhment, which could not be exhauſted in
expanding and ſupporting the animal body.</p>
               <p>It is, therefore, apparent, that penury of food
both retards the growth and diminiſhes the ſize
of the horns; and, perhaps, it is not impoſſible,
by retrenching the quantity of food, to ſuppreſs
entirely this production, without having recourſe
to caſtration. It is, however, certain, that caſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſtags eat leſs food than thoſe which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutilated;
and the females of this ſpecies, as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0195500104:125"/>
well as thoſe of the fallow-deer, the roe, and the
elk, have no horns, becauſe they eat leſs than
the males; and becauſe, at the very time that a
redundance of nouriſhment would naturally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
they are with young, and, inſtead of ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
itſelf externally, it is firſt exhauſted in nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
the foetus, and afterwards in nouriſhing
the fawn. The objection, that the female rain-deer,
which has horns like the male, rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
than weakens this argument; for, of all
horned animals, the rain-deer, in proportion to
his ſize, has the largeſt and moſt voluminous
horns, often extending, before and behind, the
whole length of the body. He likewiſe abounds
moſt in fat<note n="*" place="bottom">La Veneric de du Foilloux, p. 97.</note>; and, beſides, the horns of the female
are much ſmaller than thoſe of the male. This
example, therefore, proves no more than that,
when the redundance is ſo great as not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
by geſtation and the growth of the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
it breaks through the body, and forms a new
production, as in the male, only ſmaller in ſize,
becauſe the quantity of redundant matter is leſs.</p>
               <p>What I have remarked concerning nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ought not to be extended to the maſs or
volume of the aliments, but only to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of organic particles, that living, active, and
prolific matter which unfolds and ſupports all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
beings. The reſt is nothing but dregs,
which may be more or leſs in quantity, without
inducing any change upon the body: And, as the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0195500104:126"/>
lichen rangiferinus, or rain-deer liverwort, is the
ordinary food of the rain-deer, and is more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
than the leaves, the bark, or the buds of trees,
it is not ſurpriſing, that this animal ſhould have
a greater redundance of organic particles, and,
conſequently, larger horns, and more fat, than
the common ſtag. It muſt be acknowledged,
however, that the organic matter which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the horns is not perfectly diſengaged from
uſeleſs particles, and that it preſerves, after paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the body of the animal, marks of its former
vegetable ſtate. The horns of the ſtag ſhoot,
grow, and are diſpoſed like the branches of a
tree. Its ſubſtance is, perhaps, leſs oſſeous than
lignous. To uſe the expreſſion, it is a vegetable
grafted upon an animal, participating of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of both, and forming one of thoſe ſhades by
which nature always bounds the extremities of
her productions, and which ſhe employs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect
ſubſtances that are greatly removed from
each other.</p>
               <p>In the animal, as formerly remarked<note n="*" place="bottom">See above, vol. II. art. <hi>Of Old age and Death.</hi>
                  </note>, both
extremities of the bones grow at a time. The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum
upon which the extending power is exerted,
is in the middle of the bone, which part is always
firſt oſſified, and from which the two extremes
progreſſively recede, and continue ſoft till the
bone acquires its full length. In the vegetable,
on the contrary, only one extremity of the wood
grows. The bud, which unfolds to form a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0195500104:127"/>
branch, is attached to the old wood by its infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
extremity, and upon this fulcrum the power
of longitudinal extenſion acts. This remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
difference between the vegetation of bones
and the ſolid parts of plants, does not take place
in the horns of ſtags. On the contrary, nothing
can be more ſimilar to the growth of a tree.
The horns extend at one extremity only, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſerving for a fulcrum. They are firſt tender
as an herb, and then harden like wood. The
ſkin which covers and grows along with them is
their bark, and it is rubbed off after they attain
their full ſize. As long as they continue to grow,
their extremities are ſoft; and they likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
into ſeveral branches. In a word, every
circumſtance is ſimilar, and correſponds in the
developement of both. Hence the organic par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
which conſtitute the living ſubſtance of the
ſtag, ſtill retain the impreſſion of the vegetable;
becauſe they arrange themſelves in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as the parts of plants. Here it is apparent,
that matter has an influence upon form. The
ſtag which inhabits the foreſt, and feeds only on
the ſprigs of trees, takes ſo ſtrong an impreſſion
from the wood, that he produces a ſpecies of
tree, which preſerves indelible and evident marks
of its origin. This effect, though ſingular, is not
ſolitary, and depends on a general cauſe, which I
have already pointed out.</p>
               <p>Both in animals and vegetables, the character,
or mould, of each ſpecies, is the moſt conſtant
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0195500104:128"/>
and unalterable thing in Nature: What is moſt
variable and deſultory, is the matter of which they
are compoſed. Matter, in general, ſeems to be
indifferent to all forms, and capable of receiving
every poſſible impreſſion. The organic or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
particles of this matter paſs from vegetables
to animals, without deſtruction or alteration, and
form equally the living ſubſtance of the herb, of
the wood, of the fleſh, and of the bones. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this view, it appears that matter can
never have any influence on form, and that
no kind of food, provided the animal can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the organic particles, and aſſimilate them by
nutrition, could induce any change upon the form,
or have any other effect than to ſupport and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand
the body, by modelling itſelf upon all the
particles of the interior mould, and intimately
penetrating them. What proves this point is,
that animals which live upon herbage, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
very different from that of their own
bodies, extract from it materials ſufficient for
the production of fleſh and blood, and that they
are nouriſhed and grow as well as animals who
feed upon fleſh alone. However, by examining
Nature more minutely, we ſhall find, that theſe
organic particles ſometimes do not perfectly aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate
themſelves to the internal mould, and that
matter has often a ſenſible influence upon form.
Size, for example, which is one of the attributes
of form, varies in every ſpecies, according to the
difference of climate. The quality and quantity
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0195500104:129"/>
of fleſh, two other attributes of form, change ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the difference of food. This organic
matter, therefore, which the animal aſſimilates
to its own body by nutrition, is not abſolutely
indifferent to the reception of every form, nor
deprived of the original figure which it poſſeſſed.
It retains ſome characters of its primitive ſtate.
It acts, therefore, by its proper form upon that
of the organized body to which it affords nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment;
and, though this action is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible,
and infinitely inferior to the power
which obliges the organic particles to aſſimilate
themſelves to the internal mould that receives
them, yet, in the progreſs of time, ſenſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
muſt reſult from it. The ſtag, who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
the foreſts, and lives ſolely upon wood, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
and carries about with him a ſpecies of
trees, which is nothing but the redundant part
of his nouriſhment. The beaver, who lives in
the waters, and feeds upon fiſhes, has a tail co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with ſcales. The fleſh of the otter, and of
moſt water fowls, is a lent diet, a kind of fiſhy
fleſh. We may, therefore, preſume, that animals
perpetually nouriſhed by the ſame food, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſtrong the original impreſſion of nature,
would, in proceſs of time, acquire a tincture from
the qualities of this food, and undergo a kind of
transformation, by an aſſimilation contrary to
the firſt. The nouriſhment would no longer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilate
itſelf entirely to the form of the animal,
but the animal would partly aſſimilate itſelf to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0195500104:130"/>
the form of the nouriſhment, as we perceive in
the horns of the ſtag and the tail of the beaver.</p>
               <p>In the ſtag, the horns are an acceſſory, a part
foreign to the animal, and only regarded as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to him, becauſe it proceeds from his
body. But it is really a vegetable production,
ſince it retains the characters of that vegetable
from which it derives its origin, and reſembles
the wood of trees, in the manner of its growth,
ramification, ſolidity, drying, and ſeparation;
for, after acquiring its greateſt denſity, it
ceaſes to extract nouriſhment, it falls ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
like a ripe fruit from the branch. The
very name given to this production in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
is an indication that it has been regarded
as wood<note n="*" place="bottom">The French call the horns of a ſtag his <hi>wood.</hi>
                  </note>, and not as a horn, a bone, a tuſk,
&amp;c. And, though this theory ſeems to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
eſtabliſhed by the preceding reaſoning,
yet I ought not to paſs over a fact recorded by
the antients.

                  </note>, tell us, that ivy has been ſeen growing
round the young horns of ſtags. If this fact be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0195500104:131"/>
true, and it may eaſily be determined by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
an analogy ſtill more intimate will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
between the <hi>wood</hi> of the ſtag and that
of trees.</p>
               <p>The horns and tuſks of other animals are not
only different from the <hi>wood</hi> of the ſtag; but, in
their growth, texture, and form, both external
and internal, there is nothing analogous to wood.
The nails, the claws, the hairs, the feathers, the
ſcales of animals, grow, it is admitted, by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of vegetation; but this vegetation differs
widely from that of wood. The horns of oxen,
goats, antelopes, &amp;c. are hollow within; but
the wood of the ſtag is equally ſolid through
its whole extent. The ſubſtance of theſe horns
is the ſame with that of the nails, claws, and
ſcales: But the horns of the ſtag reſemble wood
more than any other ſubſtance. The inſide of
all hollow horns is covered with a kind of <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſteum,</hi>
and they contain in their cavity a bone,
or core, which ſupports them; they never ſhed,
but grow during the life of the animal; and its
age may be learned by their rings or annual
circles. Inſtead of growing by their ſuperior ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
like the <hi>wood</hi> of the ſtag, they grow
like nails, feathers, and hairs, by their inferior
extremity. In the ſame manner, the tuſks of
the elephant, walrus, and wild boar, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
animals, are hollow within, and grow only
by their inferior extremity. Thus horns and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0195500104:132"/>
tuſks have no more analogy to the <hi>wood</hi> of the
ſtag than nails, hairs, or feathers.</p>
               <p>Vegetation may, therefore, be reduced to three
kinds. The firſt, in which the growth proceeds
from the ſuperior extremity, as in plants, trees,
and the <hi>wood</hi> of the ſtag; the ſecond, where the
growth advances from the inferior extremity, as
in horns, nails, claws, hairs, feathers, ſcales,
tuſks, teeth, and other external parts of animal
bodies; the third, in which the growth proceeds
from both extremities at the ſame time, as in
bones, cartilages, muſcles, tendons, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
parts of animals. The material cauſe of all
theſe three ſpecies, is the redundance of organic
nouriſhment; and the aſſimilation of this nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
by the internal mould, which receives
it, is the effect. Thus the growth of an animal
is always more or leſs rapid, in proportion to the
quantity of this redundant nouriſhment; and,
after the greateſt part of growth is acquired, it
is determined to the ſeminal reſervoirs, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to eſcape from the body, and to produce,
by means of copulation, new organized beings.
The difference between animals, which, like the
ſtag, have fixed ſeaſons, and other animals which
can engender at all times, proceeds entirely from
their manner of feeding. Man and domeſtic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
who have daily an equal quantity of
food, and often too much, are perpetually in a
capacity for procreation. The ſtag, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and moſt wild animals, who ſuffer greatly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0195500104:133"/>
in the winter for want of food, have then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
redundant, and are incapable of generating
till they recruit during the ſummer. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after this ſeaſon that the ſtag begins
to rut; and, by the great waſte he ſuffers at this
period, he continues, during winter, in a ſtate
of languor and debility. His fleſh is then ſo
meagre, and his blood ſo impoveriſhed, that
worms breed under his ſkin, which ſtill augment
his miſery, and he does not get quit of them till
the ſpring, when he acquires new life and vigour
by the active nouriſhment furniſhed to him by
the freſh productions of the earth.</p>
               <p>Thus the life of the ſtag is ſpent in alternate
plenty and want, vigour and debility, health and
ſickneſs, without having any change introduced
into his conſtitution by theſe oppoſite extremes.
He lives as long as other animals which are not
ſubjected to ſuch viciſſitudes. As he grows five
or ſix years, he lives ſeven times that number,
or from 35 to 40 years<note n="*" place="bottom">Nouveau traité de la venerie, p. 141.</note>. What has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
concerning the longevity of the ſtag me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
no credit. It is only a popular prejudice
which prevailed in the days of Ariſtotle, and
which that philoſopher conſidered as improbable,
becauſe neither the time of geſtation, nor of the
growth of the young ſtag, indicated long life<note n="†" place="bottom">Vita eſſe perquam longa hoc animal fertur; ſed nihil certi ex <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

This authority ought to have aboliſhed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice:
But it has been renewed, in the ages of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
by a fabulous account of a ſtag taken by
Charles VI. in the foreſt of Senlis, with a collar
upon which was written this inſcription, <hi>Caeſar
hoc me donavit.</hi> The love of the marvellous
inclined men to believe that this animal had lived
a thouſand years, and had his collar from a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Emperor, rather than to ſuppoſe that he came
from Germany, where all the Emperors take the
name of <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The horns of the ſtag augment annually both
in height and thickneſs, from the ſecond to the
eighth year, and continue nearly in equal beauty
during all the vigour of life. But when he
grows old, his horns decline. Our ſtags have
ſeldom more than twenty or twenty-two ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
or palms; and this number, even when at
the higheſt pitch of vigour and perfection, is by
no means conſtant; for it varies every year, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the quantity of nouriſhment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the animal has enjoyed: The largeneſs of
the horns depends on the ſame cauſe; and their
quality is alſo determined by the kind of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
they receive. Like the wood of the
foreſt, the <hi>wood</hi> of the ſtag is large, tender, and
light in moiſt and fertile countries, and ſhort,
hard, and heavy, in dry and barren regions.</p>
               <p>The ſize and ſtature of the animals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
likewiſe differ according to the places
they inhabit. The ſtags which frequent the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0195500104:135"/>
valleys, or hills abounding in grain, are larger
and taller than thoſe which feed upon dry and
rocky mountains. The latter are low, thick,
and ſhort. Neither are they equally ſwift; but
they run longer than the former: They are alſo
more vicious, and have longer hair on their
heads. Their horns are commonly ſhort and
black, like a ſtunted tree, the bark of which
is always of a darker colour. But the horns of
the ſtags which feed in the plains are high, and
of a clear reddiſh colour, like the wood and bark
of trees which grow in a good ſoil. Theſe little
ſquat ſtags never frequent the lofty woods, but
keep always among the coppices, where they
can more eaſily elude the purſuit of the dogs.
The Corſican appears to be the ſmalleſt of
theſe mountain-ſtags. He exceeds not the half
of the height of the ordinary kind, and may be
regarded as a terrier among ſtags. His colour
is brown, his body is ſquat, and his legs are
ſhort. And, what convinces me, that the ſize
and ſtature of ſtags in general depend on the
quantity and quality of their food, is, that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reared one at my houſe, and fed him very
plentifully for four years, he was much taller,
thicker, and plumper at that age than the oldeſt
ſtags in my woods, which are, however, of a
very good ſize.</p>
               <p>Yellow is the moſt common colour of the
ſtag. But many of them are brown, and others
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0195500104:136"/>
red. White ſtags are more rare, and ſeem to be a
race that has become domeſtic, but very antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for both Ariſtotle and Pliny mention white
ſtags; and they appear then to have been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uncommon as at preſent. The colour of the
horns, like that of the hair, depends on the age
and nature of the animal, and the impreſſion of
the air. The horns of young ſtags are whitiſh,
and leſs deeply coloured than thoſe of the old.
Stags, whoſe colour is a clear diluted yellow,
have often pale ill-coloured horns. Thoſe which
are of a lively yellow have generally red horns;
and brown ſtags, eſpecially thoſe which have
black hair on the neck, have likewiſe black
horns. The internal ſubſtance of the horns, it
is true, is almoſt equally white in all ſtags; but
they differ greatly in ſolidity and texture. Some
of them are very ſpongy, and even contain pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
large cavities. This difference in texture is
ſufficient to account for their aſſuming different
colours; and it is unneceſſary to have recourſe
to the juices of trees, ſince we daily ſee the
whiteſt ivory turn yellow or brown after being
expoſed to the air, though its texture be much
more compact than that of the ſtag's horns.</p>
               <p>The ſtag appears to have a fine eye, an acute
ſmell, and an excellent ear. When liſtening, he
raiſes his head, erects his ears, and hears from a
great diſtance. When he is going into a cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice,
or other half covered place, he ſtops to
look round him on all ſides, and ſcents the wind,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0195500104:137"/>
to diſcover if any object is near that might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
him. He is a ſimple, and yet a curious
and crafty animal. When hiſſed or called to
from a diſtance, he ſtops ſhort, and looks ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly,
and with a kind of admiration, at carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
cattle, or men; and, if they have neither
arms nor dogs, he moves on unconcernedly, and
without flying. He appears to liſten, with great
tranquillity and delight, to the ſhepherd's pipe;
and the hunters ſometimes employ this artifice
to encourage and deceive him. In general, he
is leſs afraid of men than of dogs, and is never
ſuſpicious, or uſes any arts of concealment, but
in proportion to the diſturbances he has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
He eats ſlow, and has a choice in his ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and, after his ſtomach is full, he lies
down, and ruminates at leiſure. He ſeems to
ruminate with leſs facility than the ox. It is
only by violent ſhakes that the ſtag can make
the food riſe from his firſt ſtomach. This diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
proceeds from the length and direction of
the paſſage through which the aliment has to
go. The neck of the ox is ſhort and ſtraight;
but that of the ſtag is long and arched; and
therefore greater efforts are neceſſary to raiſe
the food. Theſe efforts are made by a kind of
hiccup, the movement of which is apparent, and
continues during the time of rumination. His
voice is ſtronger, and more quivering, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as he advances in years. The voice of
the hind is ſhorter and more feeble. She never
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0195500104:138"/>
bellows from love, but from fear. The ſtag,
during the rutting ſeaſon, bellows in a frightful
manner: He is then ſo tranſported, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
diſturbs or terrifies him. He is, therefore,
eaſily ſurpriſed; as he is loaded with fat, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep long before the dogs. But he is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
when at bay, and attacks the dogs with
a ſpecies of fury. He drinks none in winter,
nor in ſpring, the dews and tender herbage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then ſufficient to extinguiſh his thirſt. But,
during the parching heats of ſummer, to obtain
drink, he frequents the brooks, the marſhes, and
the fountains; and, in the ſeaſon of love, he is
ſo over-heated, that he ſearches every where for
water, not only to ſatisfy his immoderate thirſt,
but to bathe and refreſh his body. He then
ſwims eaſier than at any other times on account
of his fatneſs. He has been obſerved croſſing
very large rivers. It has even been alledged,
that, attracted by the odour of the hinds, the
ſtags, in the rutting ſeaſon, throw themſelves
into the ſea, and paſs from one iſland to another
at the diſtance of ſeveral leagues. They leap
ſtill more nimbly than they ſwim; for, when
purſued, they eaſily clear a hedge or a pale fence
of ſix feet high. Their food varies in different
ſeaſons. In autumn, after rutting, they ſearch
for the buds of green ſhrubs, the flowers of
broom or heath, the leaves of brambles, &amp;c.
During the ſnows of winter, they feed upon the
bark, moſs, &amp;c. of trees; and, in mild weather,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0195500104:139"/>
they brouze in the wheat-fields. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſpring, they go in queſt of the catkins
of the trembling poplar, willow, and hazel trees,
the flowers and buds of the cornel-tree, &amp;c.
In ſummer, when they have great choice, they
prefer rye to all other grain, and the black berry-bearing
alder<note n="*" place="bottom">Rhamnus frangula Linn.</note> to all other wood. The fleſh of the
fawn is very good; that of the hind and knobber
not abſolutely bad; but that of the ſtag has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a ſtrong and diſagreeable taſte. The ſkin
and the horns are the moſt uſeful parts of this
animal. The ſkin makes a pliable and very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
leather. The horns are uſed by cutlers,
ſword-ſlippers, &amp;c. and a volatile ſpirit, much
employed in medicine, is extracted from them
by the chymiſts.</p>

                  <p>It is well known, that, in many animals, as
cats, owls, &amp;c. the pupil of the eye contracts
prodigiouſly in the light, and dilates in the dark.
But this great contraction and dilatation had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been obſerved in the eyes of the ſtag. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from M. Beccaria, a learned phyſician
and celebrated profeſſor at Piſa, the following
letter, dated at Turin, October 28. 1767.</p>
                  <p>'I preſented a piece of bread,' ſays M. Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caria,
'to a ſtag that was confined in an obſcure
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0195500104:140"/>
apartment, to allure him to a window, that I
might admire at leiſure the rectangular and
tranſverſe form of his pupils, which, in a
ſtrong light, exceed not half a line in width,
by about five lines in length. In a fainter
light, their breadth enlarges to more than a
line and a half; but ſtill preſerve their rectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
figure: And in paſſing from light to
darkneſs, they dilate about four lines, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
tranſverſely, that is, horizontally, and
preſerving their rectangular form. Theſe facts
may be eaſily aſcertained, by laying the hand
upon the eye of a ſtag; for, whenever the eye
is uncovered, the pupil will be ſeen dilated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
four lines.'</p>
                  <p>From this fact M. Beccaria concludes with
probability, that the other ſpecies of deer enjoy
the ſame power of contracting and dilating their
pupils. But, what is moſt remarkable, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils
of cats, owls, and ſeveral other animals,
contract and dilate vertically, while that of the
ſtag contracts and dilates horizontally.</p>
                  <p>To the hiſtory of the ſtag, I muſt add a fact
communicated to me by M. le Marquis d'Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga,
who, to much learning, has joined great
experience in the chace.</p>
                  <p>'Stags,' he remarks, 'ſhed their horns ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or later in the month of March, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their ages. At the end of June, the
horns of the old ſtag are long, and begin to
itch him. It is at this time alſo, that the ſtags
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0195500104:141"/>
begin to rub off the ſkin which covers their
horns. At the commencement of Auguſt,
their horns begin to aſſume that conſiſtence
which they retain during the reſt of the year:
On the 17th of October, the attendants of the
Prince of Condé purſued a ſtag of ſix years
old. This was the rutting ſeaſon, when the
ſtags are much leſs vigorous; but we were
ſurpriſed to find the animal fly at a great rate,
and lead near fix leagues from his harbour.'</p>
                  <p>'When this ſtag was ſeized, we found that
his horns were white, and ſprinkled with blood,
as they ought to be at the time they are rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
againſt the trees; and that they had ſtill
rags of the ſkin which covers them during the
time of their growth. His horns were diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified
with many branches. All the hunters
who were in at the death expreſſed their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
at theſe appearances. But their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was augmented, when they wanted to
remove his teſticles; for none were to be found
in the ſcrotum. But, after opening the body,
two teſticles were diſcovered in the abdomen
about the ſize of filberds, and we clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that he had never experienced the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the rut. It is well known, that, during
the months of June, July, and Auguſt, the
ſtags are prodigiouſtly loaded with fat, which
is generally ſo entirely exhauſted about the
middle of September, that nothing but the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
fleſh remains. But this ſtag had loſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0195500104:142"/>
none of his fat, becauſe he was never in a
condition for rutting. He had ſtill another
ſingularity; for, in the right foot, he wanted
the middle bone, which, in the left, was half
an inch long, and as large and pointed as a
tooth-pick.'</p>
                  <p>'It is well known, that a ſtag, caſtrated when
he has no horns, never afterwards acquires
them, and that, if the operation is performed
when his horns are in perfection, they remain
in the ſame ſtate during life. Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that the very minute organs of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
above deſcribed were ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the annual change of horns; but that
Nature has always proceeded ſlowly in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of this animal; for we could diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
no marks of any accident which could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us to believe that the order of Nature had
been deranged. It is, therefore, reaſonable to
ſuppoſe, that this retardation proceeded from
the imbecillity of the organs of generation,
which, however, were ſufficient to produce the
fall and renewal of the horns, ſince the cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
or burs demonſtrated, that, at the time
this ſtag was killed, he had had horns annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the ſecond to the ſixth year.'</p>
                  <p>Theſe obſervations of the Marquis d'Ameza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga
ſeem to prove, in a ſtill ſtronger manner than
any thing formerly remarked, that the fall and
renovation of the ſtag's horns depend entirely
on the preſence of the teſticles, and partly on
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0195500104:143"/>
their being more or leſs perfect; for, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
before us, the teſticles being imperfect
and too ſmall, the horns, for that reaſon, in their
growth, ſhedding, and renewal, were much later
than in other ſtags.</p>
                  <p>Pontoppidan, when ſpeaking of the Norwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian
ſtags, remarks, 'that they are only found
in the dioceſes of Bergen and Drontheim;
that they ſometimes ſwim in flocks acroſs the
ſtraits between the continent and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
iſlands, reſting their heads upon each
other's crupper; and that, when the chief of
the file is fatigued, he retires behind to repoſe
himſelf, and the moſt vigorous occupies his
place<note n="*" place="bottom">Pontoppidan's Nat. Hiſt. of Norway.</note>.'</p>
                  <p>It has been thought, that the ſtags of our
foreſts might, by treating them with care and
gentleneſs, as the Laplanders manage the rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deer,
be rendered domeſtic. Upon this ſubject,
M. le Vicomte de Querhoënt has communicated
to me the following fact. Stags were firſt
brought to the Iſle of France by the Portugueſe.
They are ſmall, and of a greyer colour than
thoſe of Europe, from whom, however, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
their origin. When the French took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of this iſland, they found great numbers
of thoſe ſtags, of which they deſtroyed a part,
and the remainder took refuge in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
places. They are now rendered domeſtic,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0195500104:144"/>
and ſome of the inhabitants keep large flocks of
them.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen, at l'Ecole Veterinaire, a ſmall kind
of ſtag, which was ſaid to have been brought
from the Cape of Good Hope. Its ſkin was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed
with white ſpots, like that of the axis.
It was called the <hi>Hog-ſtag,</hi> becauſe its legs were
thicker, and it had not the ſame agility of body
as the common kind. The figure of it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
in the Plate. Its length from the muzzle
to the extremity of the body, was only three
feet four inches and a half; the legs were ſhort,
and the feet and hoofs very ſmall; the colour
yellow, mixed with white ſpots; the eye black
and open, with large black hair on the upper
eye-lid; the noſtrils black, with a blackiſh band
at the corners of the mouth; the colour of the
head the ſame with that of the belly, only mixed
with grey, and brown on the chanfrin and ſides
of the eyes; the ears very large, garniſhed on
the inſide with white hairs, and with ſmooth
hair, mixed with yellow, on the outſide. The
horns of this ſtag were eleven inches ſeven lines
in length, and ten lines thick. The top of the
back was browner than the reſt of the body. The
tail was yellow above and white below; and the
legs were of a browniſh black colour<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Pennant, in his Synopſis of Quadrupeds, which was publiſhed in the year 1771, has deſcribed this animal as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct ſpecies of deer. It is ſurpriſing, that this circumſtance ſhould have eſcaped our author, eſpecially as the two deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vary in ſeveral particulars. Mr Pennant's words are: 'PORCINE DEER, with ſlender trifurcated horns, thirteen inches long, ſix inches diſtant at the baſe; head ten inches and a half long: Body, from the tip of the noſe to the tail, three feet ſix inches: height, from the ſhoulders to the hoof, two feet two inches, and about two inches higher behind: Length of the tail eight inches: Body thick and clumſy: Legs fine and ſlender: Colour on the upper part of the neck, body, and ſides, brown; belly and rump of a lighter colour.

               <p>NO ſpecies of animals makes ſo near an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to another as the fallow deer to
that of the ſtag. But though their ſimilarity
be great in every reſpect, they fly from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
never intermix, and, of courſe, give riſe to
no intermediate race. It is even rare to find fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
deer in a country much frequented by ſtags,
unleſs they are induſtriouſly tranſported into it.
Their nature ſeems to be leſs ruſtic and robuſt
than that of the ſtag; and they are likewiſe leſs
common in the foreſts. They are kept in parks,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0195500104:151"/>
where they may be ſaid to be half domeſtic.
More of them are reared in England than in any
other country of Europe; and the Engliſh are
extremely fond of their veniſon. The dogs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
prefer the fleſh of this deer to that of all other
animals; and, after they have once eat of it,
they are extremely apt, in the chace of the ſtag
or roe deer, to change their courſe when they
perceive the ſcent of the fallow deer. In ſome
provinces of France, and in the neighbourhood
of Paris, there are fallow deer, as alſo in Spain
and Germany. Thoſe of America were probably
tranſported from Europe. It ſeems to be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
peculiar to the temperate climates; for
there are none in Ruſſia, and they are ſeldom
met with in Sweden or other northern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries<note n="*" place="bottom">Linn. Faun. Suec.</note>.</p>
               <p>The ſtags are more generally diffuſed over
Europe; they are even found in Norway, and
all the northern regions, Lapland, perhaps,
excepted. They are alſo frequent in Aſia, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Tartary<note n="†" place="bottom">Deſcription de l'Inde, par Marc Paul, liv. 1. p. 38. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres edifiantes, recueil 26. p. 371.</note>, and the northern provinces
of China. They are likewiſe found in America;
for thoſe of Canada<note n="‡" place="bottom">The Canadian ſtag is preciſely the ſame with that of France; <hi>deſcription de la Nouv. France, par Charlevoix, tom.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 129.</note> differ from ours only in
the length of their horns, and the direction of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0195500104:152"/>
their antlers<note n="*" place="bottom">See the figure of the Canadian ſtag, in <hi>l'hiſt. des animaux, par M. Perrault.</hi>
                  </note>, which is ſometimes not ſtraight,
as in the common ſtag, but turned backward, ſo
that the end of each points to the ſtem of the
horns. But this form of the horns is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
peculiar to the ſtag of Canada; for we
find ſimilar horns engraven in <hi>la Venerie de du
Fouilloux</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">La Venerie de Jacques du Fouilloux, p. 22.</note>; and thoſe of the Corſican ſtag
have ſtraight antlers; which is a ſufficient
proof that the Canadian ſtag is only a variety,
to which ſtags of all countries are ſubject.
There are likewiſe horns which have a number
of antlers on their ſummits, in form of a crown.
Theſe are rarely found in France; but, ſays Du
Fouilloux<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 20.</note>, they come from Ruſſia and Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
This is only another variety, and not a
different ſpecies from the common kind. Hence,
in Canada, as well as in France, moſt ſtags have
ſtraight antlers; but in the former, they are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thicker; becauſe they find, in theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited
regions, more nouriſhment and repoſe
than in populous countries. There are large
and ſmall ſtags in America, as well as in Europe.
But, however generally this ſpecies is diffuſed, it
ſeems to be limited to cold and temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.
The ſtags of Mexico and South A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,
thoſe of Cayenne, thoſe called <hi>Gange
ſtags,</hi> mentioned in M. Perrault's memoirs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the name of <hi>Sardinian hinds,</hi> thoſe denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<hi>Cape ſtags,</hi> and thoſe of Guiney, and other
warm countries, belong not to the common ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
as will appear when the particular hiſtory
of each is given.</p>
               <p>As the fallow deer is leſs ſavage, more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and approaches nearer to the domeſtic ſtate
than the ſtag, he is alſo ſubject to a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of varieties. Beſides the common and the
white fallow deer, there are ſeveral other varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as thoſe of Spain, which are nearly as large
as the ſtag; but their neck is not ſo thick, and
their colour is darker, with a blackiſh tail, not
white below, and longer than that of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
kind; thoſe of Virginia, which are almoſt
as large as thoſe of Spain, and remarkable for
the great ſize of their genital organs: Others
have a compreſſed forehead, ears and tail longer
than thoſe of the common fallow deer, and
marked with a white ſpot upon the hoofs of the
hind feet; others are ſpotted with white, black,
and yellow; and others are entirely black. All
theſe have their horns flatter, broader, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
garniſhed with antlers than thoſe of the ſtag;
they likewiſe incline more inwardly, and are
more palmated at the points; and, when the
horns are very ſtrong, the largeſt antlers are
ſometimes terminated by ſmall plams. The tail
of the common fallow deer is longer than that
of the ſtag, and its hair is brighter. The horns
of the fallow deer ſhed, like thoſe of the ſtag;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0195500104:154"/>
but they fall off later, and are renewed nearly
at the ſame time. Their rutting ſeaſon arrives
fifteen days or three weeks after that of the ſtag.
The males then bellow frequently, but with a
low and interrupted voice. They are not ſo
furious as the ſtag, nor exhauſt themſelves by
rutting. They never depart from their own
country in queſt of females; but they diſpute
and fight for the poſſeſſion of their miſtreſſes.
They aſſociate in herds, which almoſt always
keep together. When there is a great number
in one park, they generally form themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two diſtinct troops, which ſoon become ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,
becauſe they both wiſh to occupy the ſame
part of the incloſure. Each of theſe troops has
its own chief, who marches foremoſt; and he is
always the oldeſt and ſtrongeſt of the flock.
The others follow him; and the whole draw up
in order of battle, to force the other troop from
the beſt paſture. The order with which theſe
combats are conducted is very ſingular. They
make regular attacks, fight with courage, mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſupport each other, and never think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
vanquiſhed by a ſingle check; for the battle
is daily renewed, till the weaker are completely
defeated, and obliged to remain in the worſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.
They love elvated and hilly countries.
When chaced, they run not out, like the ſtag,
but double, and endeavour to conceal themſelves
from the dogs by artifice, and by ſubſtituting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
animal in their place. However, when
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0195500104:155"/>
fatigued and heated, they take the water, but
never attempt to croſs ſuch extenſive rivers as
the ſtag. Thus, between the chace of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
deer and ſtag, there is no material difference.
Their knowledge and inſtincts, their ſhifts and
doublings, are the ſame, only they are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
practiſed: by the fallow deer. As he is
leſs enterpriſing, and runs not ſo far before the
dogs, he has oftener occaſion to change, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
another in his place, to double, return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his former tracts, &amp;c. which renders the hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the fallow deer more ſubject to inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
than that of the ſtag. Beſides, as he is
ſmaller and lighter, the impreſſions of his feet
upon the ground are ſlighter, and the branches
he knocks off from the trees with his horns are
ſmaller. Hence the dogs are leſs apt to obſerve
the change, or ſubſtitution of another animal,
and it is more difficult to bring them into the
ſcent when at fault.</p>
               <p>The fallow deer is very eaſily tamed, and eats
many ſubſtances which are rejected by the ſtag.
He likewiſe preſerves his fat or veniſon much
better; for he is not rendered meagre by rutting,
though followed by the longeſt and ſevereſt
winters; and he is nearly in the ſame condition
during the whole year. He brouzes cloſer than
the ſtag, which makes the trees or buſhes cut by
him more difficult to ſhoot than thoſe cut by the
ſtag. The young fallow deer eat quicker, and
with more avidity than the old. They rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;

they ſearch for the females in their ſecond
year, and attach not themſelves to one, like the
roe buck, but love variety, like the ſtag. The
female goes with young eight months and ſome
days. Like the hind, ſhe produces one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two, and very rarely three fawns. They
are capable of engendering and producing from
the age of two to that of fifteen or ſixteen years.
Laſtly, the fallow deer reſemble the ſtag in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all their natural diſpoſitions and habits;
the greateſt difference between theſe two animals
conſiſts in the duration of their lives. We for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
remarked, from the teſtimony of huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that the ſtag lives thirty-five or forty years;
and, from the ſame authority, we learn that the
fallow deer live only about twenty years. As
they are ſmaller, it is probable that their growth
is ſooner accompliſhed than that of the ſtag; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
in all animals, the duration of life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the time of growing, and not to the
time of geſtation; for here the time of geſtation
is the ſame. Beſides, in other ſpecies, as that of
the ox, though the time of geſtation be long,
the duration of life is ſhort. Of courſe, we
ought not to meaſure the duration of life by the
time of geſtation, but by that of the growth,
reckoning from birth nearly to the full expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the body<note n="*" place="bottom">For a few ſupplementary remarks on the fallow deer, ſee the article <hi>Axis.</hi>

more gracefulneſs, vivacity, and courage<note n="*" place="bottom">When the fawns of the roe deer are attacked, he defends them with courage, and, though ſmaller, he has ſtrength enough to combat a young ſtag, and put him to flight; <hi>Nouv. Trailé de la Venerie,</hi> p. 178.</note>. He
is ſuperior in gaiety, neatneſs, and ſprightlineſs.
His figure is more elegant and handſome. His
eyes are more brilliant and animated. His
limbs are more nimble, his movements quicker,
and he bounds, ſeemingly without effort, with
equal vigour and agility. His coat, or hair, is
always clean, ſmooth, and gloſſy. He never
wallows in the mire, like the ſtag. He delights
in dry and elevated ſituations, where the air is
pureſt. He is likewiſe more crafty, conceals
himſelf with greater addreſs, is more difficult to
trace, and derives ſuperior reſources from inſtinct:
For, though he has the misfortune to leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him a ſtronger ſcent than the ſtag, which
redoubles the ardour and appetite of the dogs,
he knows how to withdraw himſelf from their
purſuit, by the rapidity with which he begins
his flight, and by his numerous doublings. He
delays not his arts of defence till his ſtrength
fails him; but, as ſoon as he finds that the firſt
efforts of a rapid chace have been unſucceſsful,
he repeatedly returns on his former ſteps; and,
after confounding, by theſe oppoſite movements,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0195500104:161"/>
the direction he has taken, after intermixing
the preſent with the paſt emanations from
his body, he riſes from the earth by a great
bound, and, retiring to a ſide, he lies down flat
on his belly, and, in this immoveable ſituation,
he allows the whole troop of his deceived ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to paſs very near him.</p>
               <p>The roe deer differs from the ſtag and fallow
deer in diſpoſition, temperament, manners, and
almoſt every natural habit. Inſtead of aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in heards, they live in ſeparate families. The
father, mother, and young, go together, and
never mix with ſtrangers. They are conſtant in
their amours, and never unfaithful like the ſtag.
As the females generally produce two fawns,
the one male and the other female, theſe young
animals, brought up and nouriſhed together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſo ſtrong a mutual affection, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
quit each other, unleſs one of them meets
with a misfortune, which never ought to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
lovers. This attachment is more than love;
for, though always together, they feel the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the rut but once a year, and it continues
only fifteen days, commencing at the end of
October, and ending before the fifteenth day of
November. They are not then, like the ſtag,
overloaded with fat: They have no ſtrong ſmell,
no fury, in a word, nothing that can change the
ſtate of their bodies. During this period, they
indeed ſuffer not their fawns to remain with
them. The father drives them off, as if he meant
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0195500104:162"/>
to oblige them to yield their place to thoſe
which are to ſucceed, and to form new families
for themſelves. However, after the rutting ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is paſt, the fawns return to their mother,
and remain with her ſome time; after which
they ſeparate forever, and remove to a diſtance
from the place which gave them birth.</p>
               <p>The female goes with young five months and
a half, and brings forth about the end of April
or beginning of May. The hinds, as formerly
remarked, go with young above eight months;
and this difference alone is ſufficient to prove,
that theſe animals are ſo remote from each other
in ſpecies, as to prevent their ever intermixing
or producing an intermediate race. By this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
as well as that of figure and ſize, they
approach the goat as much as they recede from
the ſtag; for the goat goes with young nearly
the ſame time, and the roe deer may be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a wild goat, which, feeding ſolely on wood,
carries <hi>wood</hi> inſtead of horns. The female, when
about to bring forth, ſeparates from the male.
To avoid the wolf, who is her moſt dangerous
enemy, ſhe conceals herſelf in the deepeſt receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the foreſt. In ten or twelve days, the
fawns acquire ſtrength ſufficient to enable them
to follow her. When threatened with danger,
ſhe hides them in a cloſe thicket, and, to preſerve
them, preſents herſelf to be chaced. But, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all her care and anxiety, the young
are ſometimes carried off by men, dogs, or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0195500104:163"/>
wolves. This is indeed the time of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
deſtruction. Of this ſpecies, which is not
very numerous, I know, from experience, that
more are deſtroyed in the month of May, than
during all the reſt of the year. I often live in a
part of the country<note n="*" place="bottom">At Montbard in Burgundy.</note> where roe deer are greatly
eſteemed. Many fawns are annually brought
me alive by men, and others killed by dogs,
without reckoning thoſe which are devoured by
wolves: And I have obſerved, during the ſpace
of more than twenty-five years, that, as if there
were a perfect equilibrium between the cauſes
of deſtruction and renovation, their number is
always nearly equal in the ſame diſtricts. It is
not difficult to count them; for they are no
where numerous, and they live ſeparately in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
families: In a coppice, for example, of
100 acres, there will be one family, or from three
to five individuals; for a female, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
produces two fawns, ſometimes brings forth
but one, and ſometimes, though very ſeldom,
three. In another diſtrict, of double the extent,
there will be ſeven or eight, that is, two fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
and I have remarked, that each diſtrict al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
harbours an equal number, excepting when
the winters have been extremely rigorous and
long: In this caſe, the whole family is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but it is replaced by another the following
year; and thoſe diſtricts, for which they have a
predilection, are always inhabited nearly by an
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0195500104:164"/>
equal number. It is alledged, however, that, in
general, their number is diminiſhing. There are
whole provinces, it muſt be acknowledged, of
France, where not one of them is to be found.
Though common in Scotland<note n="*" place="bottom">They are not very common in Scotland; for they exiſt no where but in what is called the <hi>Highlands,</hi> or northern moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Scotland.</note>, there are none
in England. They are very rare in Italy; and
they are now ſcarcer in Sweden than formerly,
&amp;c. But this effect may have proceeded from
the diminution of foreſts, or from ſome very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
winter, like that of the year 1709, which
almoſt deſtroyed the whole roe deer of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
ſo that ſeveral years paſſed before the ſpecies
was recruited. Beſides, they are not equally
fond of every country; for, in the ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
they prefer particular places. They love
hills, or plains on the tops of mountains. They
never ſtay in the deepeſt receſſes of the foreſts,
nor in the middle of extenſive woods; but give
the preference to the ſkirts or projections of
woods which are ſurrounded with cultivated
ſields, and to open coppices which produce the
berry-bearing alder, brambles, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fawns continue with their parents eight
or nine months, and, when ſeparated, about the
end of the firſt years of their age, their firſt horns
begin to appear in the form of two knobs much
leſs than thoſe of the ſtag. There is ſtill a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
difference between theſe two animals: The
horns of the ſtag ſhed in the ſpring, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0195500104:165"/>
in ſummer; but thoſe of the roe deer fall
off at the end of autumn, and are replaced in
winter. Several cauſes concur in producing theſe
different effects. In ſummer, the ſtag takes a
great deal of nouriſhment, and grows exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
fat; he next exhauſts himſelf ſo much
in the rutting ſeaſon, that the whole winter is
neceſſary to recover his vigour. But, during
this ſeaſon, inſtead of ſuperabundant nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he is half ſtarved for want of ſubſiſtence,
and, conſequently, his horns cannot begin to
ſhoot till the ſpring, when his nouriſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to be redundant. The roe deer, on the
contrary, who is never ſo much waſted, has no
occaſion for equal reparation; and, as he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
loaded with fat, as no change is produced in
him by rutting, but continues always nearly the
ſame, he has at all times a redundance of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment;
ſo that even in winter, and a ſhort
time after rutting, he ſheds and renews his horns.
Thus, in all theſe animals, the redundant orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic
nouriſhment, before it is determined to the
ſeminal reſervoirs, and forms the ſeminal fluid,
is transferred to the head, and manifeſts itſelf
externally by the production of horns; in the
ſame manner as in man, the hair and the beard
announce and precede the ſecretion of the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
fluid: And, it is apparent, that theſe vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
productions, as they may be denominated,
are formed of a redundant organic ſubſtance, but
ſtill imperfect, and mixed with brute particles,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0195500104:166"/>
ſince they preſerve, in their growth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
the qualities of vegetables. But the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
fluid, the production of which is not ſo
early, is a matter purely organic, deprived en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
of its brute particles, and perfectly aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to the body of the animal.</p>
               <p>When the roe deer has renewed his horns, he
rubs them againſt the trees, like the ſtag, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to tear off the ſkin with which they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
and this commonly happens in the month
of March, before the trees begin to ſhoot. Hence
it is not the ſap of the wood which colours the
horns of the roe deer. However, the horns are
brown when the animal is brown, and yellow
when he is red; and, conſequently, the colour
of the horns proceeds, as formerly remarked<note n="*" place="bottom">See above, Hiſtory of the ſtag, p. 103.</note>,
ſolely from the nature of the animal, and the
impreſſion of the air. The ſecond horns of the
roe have two or three antlers in each ſide; the
third, three or four; the fourth, four or five,
and they ſeldom have more. We diſtinguiſh
the old ones by the thickneſs of the ſtems, the
largeneſs of the bur, of the pearlings, &amp;c. As
long as the horns continue ſoft, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
ſenſible: Of this I have had a ſtriking
example: The young ſhoot of a roe buck's
horn was cut off with a ball. The animal
was ſtunned, and fell down as if he had been
dead. The ſhooter, who was near, ſeized him
by the foot; but the buck, ſuddenly recovering
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0195500104:167"/>
his ſenſes and his ſtrength, dragged the man,
though he was ſtrong and alert, thirty paces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wood. After killing him with a knife,
we diſcovered that he had received no other
wound. Beſides, it is well known, that flies are
very troubleſome to the ſtag: When his horns
are growing, he retires to the deepeſt parts of
the wood, where the flies are leſs numerous;
becauſe, when they fix upon the tender horns,
the irritation they occaſion is inſupportable.
Thus there is an intimate communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſoft parts of the horns, and the whole
nervous ſyſtem of the animal. The roe buck,
who has nothing to apprehend from the flies,
becauſe he renews his horns in winter, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
in this manner; but he walks with caution,
and carries his head low, leſt he ſhould touch
the branches.</p>
               <p>In the ſtag, the fallow deer, and roe buck,
the frontal bone has two proceſſes, or eminences,
on which the horns reſt. Theſe proceſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to ſhoot at the age of five or ſix months,
ſoon after acquire their full growth, and, inſtead
of riſing higher in proportion as the animal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
in years, they annually ſink and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh;
ſo that, in old ſtags or roe bucks, the
burs are nearly ſupported upon the frontal bone,
the proceſſes of which having then become very
broad and very ſhort: This is the moſt certain
mark by which the age of theſe animals can be
diſtinguiſhed. At firſt ſight, this fact appears to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0195500104:168"/>
be ſingular, but admits of an eaſy explanation,
when it is conſidered, that the horns, ſupported
by theſe proceſſes, preſs againſt them during the
whole time of growth, which continues for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
months every year: Hence theſe bones,
however hard, muſt become broader and ſink
lower annually, by the great and long continued
preſſure they receive from every renewal of the
animal's horns. It is for the ſame reaſon, that,
though the ſtems and burs, or rings, always
grow thicker in proportion to the animal's age,
the height of the horns and the number of
antlers diminiſh ſo faſt, that, when he is very
old, they are only two thick knobs, with very
ſmall antlers.</p>
               <p>As the female roe goes with young only five
months and a half, and as the growth of the
fawn is more rapid than that of the ſtag, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of her life is much ſhorter, ſeldom exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I imagine, beyond twelve or fifteen years.
I have reared ſeveral of them; but could never
preſerve them above five or ſix years. They
are very delicate in the choice of their food, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a great deal of exerciſe, fine air, and much
room, which is the reaſon why they are unable,
excepting in the firſt years of their growth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the inconveniences of a domeſtic life. To make
a male live comfortable, he muſt be furniſhed with
a female, and a park of a hundred acres. They
may be tamed, but can never be rendered obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
or familiar. They always retain a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0195500104:169"/>
of their natural wildneſs, are eaſily terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and then run with ſuch force and precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the walls, that they often break
their limbs. However tame they may be, they
cannot be truſted; for the males particularly are
ſubject to dangerous caprices; they take an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
at certain perſons, and make furious attacks
with their horns, the blows of which are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to knock a man to the ground, after which
they continue to tread on him with their feet.
The roe buck bellows not ſo frequently, nor
with ſo loud or ſo ſtrong a voice, as the ſtag.
The young ones utter a ſhort and plaintive cry,
<hi>mi....mi,</hi> by which they indicate their want of
food. This ſound is eaſily imitated; and the
mother, deceived by the <hi>call,</hi> will come up to
the very muzzle of the hunter's gun.</p>
               <p>In winter, the roe bucks frequent the thickeſt
coppices, and feed upon brambles, broom, heath,
the catkins of the hazel, willow, &amp;c. In ſpring,
they repair to the more open bruſhwood, and
eat the buds and young leaves of almoſt every
tree. This warm food ferments in their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs,
and intoxicates them to ſuch a degree
that they are eaſily ſurpriſed. They know not
where they are going, and not unfrequently
come out of the wood, and ſometimes approach
flocks of cattle, and the habitations of men. In
ſummer, they dwell in the more elevated coppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
from which they ſeldom depart, excepting
in very dry weather, when they go to drink at
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0195500104:170"/>
ſome fountain; for, when the dews abound,
or the leaves are moiſtened with rain, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
drink. They are delicate in the choice of
their food; they eat not with avidity, like the
ſtag, and they ſeldom approach the cultivated
fields, becauſe they prefer the berry-bearing alder
and bramble to grain or pot herbs of any kind.</p>
               <p>Though the fleſh of theſe animals be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
food; yet it admits of much choice. The
quality of their veniſon depends chiefly on
the country they inhabit; and even the beſt
countries produce good and bad kinds. The
fleſh of the brown roe buck is finer than that of
the red. All the males, after the age of two
years, have hard and ill-taſted fleſh; but that of
the females, though farther advanced in years,
is more tender. The fleſh of the fawns, when
very young, is looſe and ſoft; but, at the age of
eighteen months, it is in its higheſt ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Thoſe which live in plains and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
are not good; thoſe that come from moiſt
countries are ſtill worſe; thoſe brought up in
parks are inſipid; and, laſtly, there are no good
roe bucks but thoſe of dry and elevated coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
interſperſed with hills, woods, cultivated
and fallow lands, where they enjoy plenty of air,
food, freedom, and ſolitude; for thoſe which
have been often diſturbed are meagre, and the
fleſh of thoſe that have been often hunted is dry
and inſipid.</p>
               <p>This ſpecies, which is leſs numerous than that
of the ſtag, and very rare in many parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0195500104:171"/>
ſeems to be much more abundant in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
where there are two varieties, the red,
which is the largeſt, and the brown, which has
a white ſpot behind, and is ſmaller: And, as
they are found in the northern as well as the
ſouthern parts of America, it is probable that
they differ more from each other than from
thoſe of Europe. They are very common,
for example, in Louiſiana<note n="*" place="bottom">The fleſh of the roe buck is much uſed in Louiſiana. This animal is ſomewhat larger than the European kind, and his horns are ſimilar to thoſe of the ſtag; but he differs both in the coat and the colour.

in Brazil; for the animal called <hi>Cujuacu-apara</hi>
differs not more from our roe buck than
the ſtag of Canada from our ſtag. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a little variation in the figure of the horns,
as appears from Perrault's figure of the Canadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
ſtag, compared with the deſcription and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the Braſilian ſtag given by Piſo. 'In
Brazil,' ſays Piſo, 'there are roe bucks, of
which ſome have no horns, and are called
<hi>Cujuacu-été,</hi> and others have horns, and are
called <hi>Cujuacu-apara.</hi> The latter are ſmaller
than the former; their hair is ſmooth, gloſſy,
and mixed with brown and white, eſpecially
when the animals are young; for the white is
effaced with age. The foot is divided into two
black toes, upon each of which there is a ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0195500104:172"/>
eyes large and black; the noſtrils open; the
horns are of a middle ſize, and fall off annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
The female goes with young five or ſix
months. They may be tamed<note n="*" place="bottom">Piſon. Hiſt. Braſil. p. 98.</note>,' &amp;c. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graave
adds, 'that the horns of the <hi>apara</hi> have
three branches, and that the inferior branch is
longeſt and divided into two.' From theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
it is apparent, that the <hi>apara</hi> is only a
variety of our roe buck; and Ray ſuſpects<note n="†" place="bottom">Raii Synopſ. anim. quad. p. 90.</note>,
that the <hi>Cujuacu-apara</hi> is the male, and the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juacu-été</hi>
the female, and that they both belong
to the ſame ſpecies. I ſhould willingly aſſent to
Mr Ray's opinion, if Piſo had not expreſsly ſaid,
that thoſe which have horns are ſmaller than
the other kind. It is not probable that, at Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil,
the females of this ſpecies ſhould be larger
than the males, ſince every where elſe they are
ſmaller. At the ſame time, though I believe the
<hi>Cujuacu-apara</hi> to be only a variety of our roe

                  <p>It has frequently been mentioned, in my ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
work, that the common colours of wild
animals are yellow, brown, and grey, and that
the domeſtic ſtate gives riſe to white fallow deer,
white rabbits, &amp;c. I find, however, that Nature
alone ſometimes produces the ſame effect upon
wild animals. M. l'Abbé de la Villette informs
me, that a man belonging to his brother's eſtate,
near Orgelet in Franche-comté, brought him two
old roe deers, one of which was of the common
colour, and the other, being a female, was white
as milk, and had no black but on the hoofs and
the extremity of the noſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Extract of a letter from M. l'Abbé de la Villette a M. de Buffon, dated Lon-le-Saumier, June 17. 1773.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Roe bucks, ſimilar to thoſe of Europe, are
found throughout all North America; only
they are larger, and their ſize increaſes in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as the climate becomes more temperate.
The roe bucks of Louiſiana are generally double
the ſize of thoſe of France<note n="†" place="bottom">Extract of a letter from M. de Fontenelle, King's phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian at New Orleans, to M. de Buffon.</note>. M. de Fontenelle
adds, that they are eaſily tamed. In this he is
ſupported by the evidence of M. Kalm, who
mentions a roe buck which went daily to the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0195500104:174"/>
wood in queſt of food, and returned to his houſe
in the evening<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage de Pierre Kalm, tom. 2. p. 350.</note>. But, in South America, this
ſpecies is ſubject to great varieties. M. de la
Borde, King's phyſician at Cayenne, ſays, 'that
they have there four kinds of ſtags, called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately,
both males and females, by the
name of <hi>hinds.</hi> The firſt kind, called <hi>wood</hi> or
<hi>red hinds,</hi> keep perpetually in the thickeſt parts
of the woods, to avoid being tormented by the
flies. This kind is taller and thicker than that
called the <hi>ſavanna hind,</hi> and yet is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſize by the <hi>barallou hind,</hi> which is the
ſecond ſpecies, and of the ſame colour with the
wood hind. When the males are old, their
horns conſiſt of only one branch, and they at
no period exceed four or five inches in height.
Theſe barallou hinds are rare, and combat the
wood hinds. In theſe two ſpecies, at the ſide
of each noſtril, there are two conſiderable
glands which ſecrete a white, fetid humour.'</p>
                  <p>'The third ſpecies is called the <hi>ſavanna hind.</hi>
Its coat is greyiſh, and its limbs and body long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the preceding. M. de la Borde was
aſſured by the hunters, that the ſavanna hind
had no glands on the noſtrils, and that it was
leſs ſavage, and even ſo curious as to approach
men.'</p>
                  <p>'The fourth ſpecies is the ſavanna hind,
which is ſmaller and more common than the
other three. They are not ſo wild, and their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0195500104:175"/>
horns are longer and more palmated or branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than thoſe of the other three kinds. They
are called <hi>ſavanna hinds,</hi> becauſe they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
the watery ſavannas, and lands covered
with marſhes.'</p>
                  <p>'Theſe animals feed upon the manioc, and
often deſtroy the plantations. Their fleſh is
very tender and well-taſted. Both the old and
the young are uſed as food, and are ſuperior
to the European ſtags. They tame ſo eaſily,
that they run about the ſtreets of Cayenne,
and go out of the town and return, without
being afraid of any object. The females even

                  <p>'The caricou is the ſmalleſt; his hair is of a
whitiſh grey colour; and his horns are ſtraight
and pointed. He belongs rather to the roe

inhabited places; but is very common in large
woods. However, he is eaſily tamed; and
the female brings forth only one fawn every

               <p>THE moſt numerous ſpecies of animals are
by no means the moſt uſeful. Nothing
can be more noxious than thoſe multitudes of
rats, mice, locuſts, caterpillars, and other inſects,
the fecundity of which Nature ſeems rather to
permit than to ordain. But the ſpecies of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0195500104:179"/>
hare and of the rabbit afford to man the double
advantage ariſing from number and utility. The
hare is univerſally diffuſed over all the climates
of the earth. The rabbits, though originally na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of particular climates, multiply ſo prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
wherever they are tranſported, that, inſtead
of being rooted out, much art is neceſſary to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
their number, which is ſometimes incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious.</p>
               <p>When we reflect on the amazing fecundity
of each ſpecies, the rapid and prodigious multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of particular animals which come forth
in myriads to ravage the earth, we are aſtoniſhed
that they oppreſs not Nature by their numbers,
and, after deſolating her productions, fall vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims
to the univerſal waſte they have created.</p>
               <p>We view with terror the approach of thoſe
thick clouds, thoſe winged armies of famiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects,
which ſeem to threaten the whole globe
with deſtruction, and, lighting on the fruitful
plains of Egypt, or of India, annihilate, in an
inſtant, the labours and the hopes of nations;
and, ſparing neither grain, nor fruits, nor herbs,
nor leaves, nor roots, ſpoil the earth of its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
and convert the richeſt countries into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.
We behold, deſcending from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the north, innumerable multitudes of
rats, which, like an animated deluge, overwhelm
the plains, ſpread over the ſouthern provinces,
and, after deſtroying, in their paſſage, every thing
that lives or vegetates, finiſh their noxious courſe,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0195500104:180"/>
by infecting the earth and the air with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
emanations of their dead carcaſſes. In the
ſouthern regions, we behold, iſſuing ſuddenly
from the deſerts, myriads of ants, which, like an
inexhauſtible torrent, preſs forward in continued
columns, drive men and animals from their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,
and never retire till they have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
an univerſal devaſtation: And, when men,
like the animals, were half ſavage, and ſubject
to all the laws and exceſſes of Nature, have not
ſimilar inundations of the human ſpecies taken
place? Have not Normans, Huns, Goths, whole
nations, or rather colonies of fierce and brutal
people, without habitation or name, ſuddenly
iſſued from their caverns, and with no other
power but what ariſes from number, overturned
cities and empires, and, after laying waſte the
earth, repeopled it with men equally new and
barbarous as themſelves?</p>
               <p>Theſe great events, theſe remarkable aeras in
the hiſtory of the human race, are, however,
only ſlight viciſſitudes in the ordinary courſe of
animated Nature, which, in general, is always
the ſame: Its movements are performed on two
ſteady pivots, unlimited fecundity, and thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
cauſes of deſtruction which reduce the
product of this fecundity to a determined mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and preſerve, at all periods, nearly an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
number of individuals in each ſpecies. And,
as thoſe enormous multitudes of animals, which
ſometimes ſuddenly appear, vaniſh without aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0195500104:181"/>
menting the common ſtock, that of the human
ſpecies, in like manner, continues always the
ſame. The variations of the latter are only
ſlower; becauſe, the life of man being longer
than that of ſmall animals, more is neceſſary to
bring about the alternate changes of augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diminution. But even this time, though
it makes a deep impreſſion, becauſe it has been
accompanied with horror and deſolation, is only
an inſtant in the ſucceſſion of ages: For, in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
the whole human ſpecies who ever exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the number of men, like that of all other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
ought, at all periods, to be nearly the
ſame, ſince it depends upon the equilibrium of
phyſical cauſes; and this equilibrium, to which
every thing has been long reduced, cannot be
infringed either by the efforts of men, or by any
moral circumſtances, which are only particular
effects of thoſe phyſical cauſes. Whatever care
man may beſtow on his own ſpecies, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
render it more numerous in one place, but
at the expence of an equal diminution in another.
When any portion of the earth is overſtocked
with men, they diſperſe, or deſtroy each other,
and often eſtabliſh ſuch laws and cuſtoms as give
too great a check to this exceſs of multiplication.
In remarkably prolific climates, as in China,
Egypt, and Guiney, the inhabitants baniſh, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilate,
ſell, or drown their offſpring: In France,
and other Catholic countries, they are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to perpetual celebacy. Thoſe who exiſt, uſurp
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0195500104:182"/>
eaſily the rights of thoſe who have no exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
Regarding themſelves as neceſſary beings,
they annihilate thoſe which are contingent, and,
for their own convenience, ſuppreſs future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.
The ſame reſtrictions are laid upon
man, without his perceiving it, as are impoſed upon
the other animals: We cheriſh or multiply, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
or deſtroy our ſpecies, according to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
or inconveniences which reſult from them:
And, as all moral effects depend upon phyſical
cauſes, which, ever ſince the earth acquired its
conſiſtence, are fixed and permanent, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the human ſpecies, as well as that of all
other animals, muſt likewiſe be conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable.
Beſides, this ſixed ſtate, this conſtant
number, imply not abſolute quantities. All phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
and moral cauſes, and the effects that reſult
from them, are balanced, and comprehended
within certain limits, which are more or leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but never to ſuch a degree as to deſtroy
the equilibrium. As the whole univerſe is in
perpetual motion, as all the powers of matter
mutually act upon and counterbalance each other,
every effect is produced by a kind of oſcillations,
to the middle points of which we refer the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
courſe of Nature, and the extremes are
thoſe effects which are fartheſt removed from
that courſe. Hence we find, that, both in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
and vegetables, an exceſſive multiplication
is commonly followed by ſterility: Plenty and
ſcarcity alternately ſucceed each other, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0195500104:183"/>
ſo quickly, that a tolerable judgment may
be formed of the produce of one year by that of
the preceding year. Apple, plumb, oak, beech,
and moſt fruit and foreſt trees, produce abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
but once every other ſeaſon. When ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars,
flies, field-mice, and other animals
mutliply to exceſs in one year, their number is
greatly diminiſhed the following year. If inſects,
during theſe fertile ſeaſons, multiplied the next
in proportion to their numbers, the whole fruits
of the earth, all our domeſtic animals, and even
man himſelf, would fall victims to their rapacity.
But the cauſes of deſtruction and ſterility imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ſucceed thoſe which give riſe to a redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
multiplication. Neither is this deſtruction
occaſioned by contagion: It is a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of too great a maſs of animated matter
collected in one place. In every ſpecies, there
are particular cauſes of death, as ſhall afterwards
be ſhown, which are ſufficient to compenſate the
exceſs of preceding generations.</p>
               <p>I muſt again remark, that this reaſoning is not
to be underſtood in an abſolute or even in a ſtrict
ſenſe, eſpecially with regard to thoſe ſpecies which
are not left entirely to the guidance of Nature.
Man, and the other animals he has taken under
his protection and care, are more abundant than
they would be without that attention he beſtows
on them. But, as this care has alſo its limits,
the augmentation which reſults from it, has long
been confined by immutable boundaries. And
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0195500104:184"/>
though, in civilized countries, the human ſpecies,
as well as domeſtic animals, are more numerous
than in other climates, they never multiply to
exceſs; becauſe, whenever they become incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
their number is diminiſhed by the ſame
power that produced them.</p>
               <p>In diſtricts appropriated to the pleaſures of the
chace, four or five hundred hares are ſometimes
killed in the courſe of a ſingle day's ſport. The
multiplication of theſe animals is very rapid.
From the firſt year of their exiſtence, they are
always in a condition for propagating. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
go with young only thirty or thirty-one
days. They bring forth three or four at a litter,
and, immediately afterwards, they receive the
male. They likewiſe admit him during the time
of geſtation; and, from a peculiar conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their organs, they have frequent ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foetations:
For the uterus is only a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the vagina, and has neither neck nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice,
as in other animals; but, in each horn,
there is an orifice opening into the vagina, which
dilates during the time of bringing forth. Thus
the horns are two diſtinct uteri, which can act
independent of each other; ſo that the females
of this ſpecies are capable of conceiving and
bringing forth, at different times, by each ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;
and, conſequently, ſuperfoetations muſt
be as frequent among theſe animals as they are
rare in thoſe which have not a double organ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0195500104:185"/>
It is, therefore, apparent, that the female
hares may be in ſeaſon and impregnated at all
times. Another ſingularity in their ſtructure
proves them to be equally laſcivious as they are
fertile. The glans of the clitoris is prominent,
and nearly as large as that of the male penis;
and, as the vulva is hardly viſible, and the male,
when young, has neither ſcrotum nor teſticles on
the outſide of the body, it is often difficult to
diſtinguiſh the females from the males. This
peculiarity of ſtructure has given riſe to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
notions: That hermophradite hares are
very common; that the males ſometimes bring
forth young; and that ſome are alternately males
and females, and perform the functions of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſex, becauſe the females, being more ardent
than the males, often mount upon them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the external reſemblance is ſo great, that,
unleſs narrowly examined, the one may eaſily
be miſtaken for the other.</p>
               <p>The young, when brought forth, have their
eyes open. The mother ſuckles them about
twenty days; after which they ſeparate, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their own food. They never remove far
from each other, nor from the place where they
are littered. They live, however, in ſolitude,
each making a form or ſeat at the diſtance of
ſixty or eighty paces. Thus, when we meet with
one young hare, we are almoſt certain of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two or three others in the neighbourhood.
They feed more in the night than in the day;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0195500104:186"/>
they eat herbs, roots, leaves, fruit, grain, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
thoſe plants which have milky juices.
During winter, they gnaw the bark indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
from all trees, excepting that of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and lime, which they never touch. When
reared in houſes, they are fed with lettuce and
pot-herbs: But the fleſh of thoſe fed hares is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
bad taſted.</p>
               <p>During the day, they ſleep or repoſe in their
form, and are active only in the night, when
they move about, feed, and copulate. When
the moon ſhines, they are ſeen playing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
leaping and chacing each other. The ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
motion, or the noiſe of a falling leaf, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to terrify and make them fly different
ways.</p>
               <p>Some authors maintain, that hares chew the
cud. But I cannot aſſent to this opinion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have one ſtomach only, and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
as well as that of the other inteſtines,
are totally different from thoſe of ruminating
animals. The caecum of the latter is ſmall, but
that of the hare is very large; and, when to the
capacity of the ſtomach this large caecum is
added, it is eaſy to perceive that this animal, by
taking a great quantity of aliment, may live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
herbs alone, like the horſe and aſs, which
have alſo a large caecum, and but one ſtomach,
and, conſequently, are incapable of ruminating.</p>
               <p>Hares ſleep much, but always with open eyes.
They have neither eye-lids nor cilia, and their
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0195500104:187"/>
eyes ſeem to be bad. But, as a remuneration,
they have an acute ſenſe of hearing, and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
ears in proportion to the ſize of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Theſe long ears they move with great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
and employ them as a rudder to direct
their courſe, which is ſo rapid, that they outſtrip
all other animals. As their fore legs are much
ſhorter than the hind legs, they run eaſier up
than down hill; hence, when purſued, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
take to the higheſt grounds. Their run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is a kind of gallop, a ſucceſſion of quick
leaps. Their motion is not accompanied with
noiſe; becauſe their feet are covered, both above
and below, with hair. They are perhaps the
only animals which have hair in the inſide of
the mouth.</p>
               <p>The duration of their life, like that of other
animals, is proportioned to the time of their
growth, which is completed in one year, and
they live about ſeven. The males are ſaid to
live longer than the females. They paſs their
days in ſolitude and ſilence; and their voice is
never heard but when ſeized or wounded: It is
a loud, ſharp cry, having ſome reſemblance to
the human voice. They are not ſo ſavage as
their manners and habits would indicate: They
are gentle, and ſuſceptible of a kind of education.
Though eaſily tamed, and even rendered careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
they never acquire that attachment which
is neceſſary to make them domeſtic; for, when
taken young, and brought up in the houſe, they
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0195500104:188"/>
take the firſt opportunity of regaining their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and of flying to the fields. As they have
a fine ear, ſit ſpontaneouſly on their hind legs,
and uſe the fore legs as a kind of hands, they
have been trained to beat a drum, to perform
geſtures in cadence, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In general, the hare wants neither inſtinct
ſufficient for his own preſervation, nor ſagacity
for eſcaping his enemies. He forms a ſeat or
neſt: In winter, he chooſes ſituations expoſed
to the ſouth, and, in ſummer, to the north.
With a view to deceive, he conceals himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
clods or hillocks of the ſame colour with
that of his own hair. 'I have ſeen,' ſays Fouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loux,
'a hare ſo ſagacious, that, after hearing
the hunter's horn, he ſtarted from his form,
and, though at the diſtance of a quarter of a
league, went to ſwim in a pool, and lay
down on the ruſhes in the middle of it,
without being chaced by the dogs. I have
ſeen a hare, after running two hours before
the dogs, puſh another from his ſeat, and take
poſſeſſion of it. I have ſeen others ſwim over
two or three ponds, the narroweſt of which was
eighty paces broad. I have ſeen others, after a
two hours chace, run into a ſheep-fold and lie
down among them. I have ſeen others, when
hard puſhed, run in among a flock of ſheep,
and would not leave them. I have ſeen others,
after hearing the noiſe of the hounds, conceal
themſelves in the earth. I have ſeen others
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0195500104:189"/>
run up one ſide of a hedge and return by the
other, when there was nothing elſe between
them and the dogs. I have ſeen others, after
running half an hour, mount an old wall, ſix
feet high, and clap down in a hole covered with
ivy. Laſtly, I have ſeen others ſwim over a
river of about eighty paces broad, more than
two times, in a length of two hundred paces.'</p>
               <p>But theſe facts unqueſtionably exhibit the
greateſt efforts of their inſtinct; for their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
reſources are not ſo fine nor ſo complicated:
When purſued, they firſt run with rapidity, and
then double, or return upon their former ſteps.
They always run in the direction that the wind
blows. The females run not ſo far from their
place of ſtarting as the males; but they double
oftener. In general, hares hunted in the place
that gave them birth, never remove to a great
diſtance from it, but return to their form; and,
if chaced two days ſucceſſively, they perform, in
the ſecond day, the ſame doublings they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the day before. When a hare runs
ſtraight out, and to a great diſtance from the
place he ſtarted, it is a proof that he is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
It often happens, that male hares, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
during the moſt remarkable period of rutting,
which is in the months of January, February,
and March, when they have few females near
them, perform journies of ſeveral leagues in
queſt of mates; but, as ſoon as they are ſtarted
by the dogs, they fly back to the place of their
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0195500104:190"/>
nativity, and never more return. The females
wander not in this manner. Though longer
than the males, they are weaker and leſs agile:
But they are more timid; for they never allow
the dogs to come ſo near their ſeats as the males,
and their doublings are more frequent. They
are alſo more delicate, and more ſuſceptible of
impreſſions from the weather. They avoid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and dews. But there are males called <hi>meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
hares,</hi> which love marſhy and watery grounds.
The fleſh of theſe hares is bad taſted; and, in
general, the fleſh of all hares which inhabit val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
is whitiſh and inſipid; but thoſe of elevated
or hilly countries, where the wild thime and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſavory herbs abound, are extremely good.
It has even been remarked, that thoſe which live
in the low woody grounds of the ſame country,
are not near ſo good as thoſe that inhabit the
ridges of hills, or the cultivated fields, and vine-yards;
and that the fleſh of the female is always
more delicate than that of the male.</p>
               <p>The nature of the ſoil has a conſiderable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on the hare, as well as upon all other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
The mountain hares are larger than thoſe
of the plains, and likewiſe of a different colour.
The former are browner, and have more white
under the neck than the latter, which are almoſt
red. In high mountains, and in northern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
they become white during winter, and
reſume their uſual colour in the ſummer. Only
a few, and perhaps theſe are very old, continue
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0195500104:191"/>
white; for they all turn more or leſs white with
age. The hares of Italy, Spain, and Barbary,
are ſmaller than thoſe of France and other nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
nations. According to Ariſtotle, they are
ſmaller in Egypt than in Greece.</p>
               <p>Hares are equally diffuſed over all climates.
They abound in Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
France, Britain, Germany, Barbary, Egypt,
the iſlands of the Archipelago, and particularly
Delos<note n="*" place="bottom">Deſcript. des Iſles de l'Archipel de Dapper, p. 375.</note>, which was called <hi>Lagaia</hi> by the antient
Greeks, becauſe of the number of hares which
were found there. Laſtly, hares are numerous
in Lapland<note n="†" place="bottom">Les Oeuvres de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 180. Il genio va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gante, tom. 2. p. 46. Voyage de la Martiniere, p. 74.</note>, where they are white for ten
months of the year, and reſume their proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
only during the two warm months of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Hence it appears, that every climate is
nearly equal to theſe animals. It has, however,
been remarked, that they are leſs frequent in
the Eaſt than in Europe, and that they are very
rare in South America, though they again make
their appearance in Virginia, Canada<note n="‡" place="bottom">La relation de la Gaſpeſie, par le P. le Clercq, p. 488. &amp;c.</note>, in the
neighbourhood of Hudſon's bay<note n="§" place="bottom">Le Voyage de Robert Lade, tom. 2. p. 317.</note>, and the
ſtraits of Magellan. But theſe North American
hares are perhaps a different ſpecies from ours;
for travellers inform us, that they are not only
much larger, but that their fleſh is white, and of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0195500104:192"/>
a different taſte from that of the common kind<note n="*" place="bottom">La ſuite des voyages de Dampier, tom. 5. p. 167.</note>.
They add, that the hair of the North American
hares never falls off, and that their ſkins are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
furs. In exceſſively hot countries, as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negal,
Gambia, Guiney<note n="†" place="bottom">L'Hiſt. gen. des Voyages, par M. l'Abbé Prevôt, tom. 3. p. 235. 296.</note>, and particularly in
the cantons of Fida, Apam, Agra, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
regions ſituated under the Torrid Zone,
both in Africa and America, as in New Holland,
and the Iſthmus of Panama, there are animals
which have been called <hi>hares</hi> by travellers, but
are rather a ſpecies of rabbit<note n="‡" place="bottom">Dampier, vol. 4. p. 111. Wafer tom. 4. p. 224.</note>; for the rabbit
is a native of warm climates, and is never found
very far to the north; but the hares are larger
and ſtronger in proportion to the coldneſs of the
country they inhabit.</p>
               <p>This animal, though ſo much in requeſt for
the tables of Europeans, is not reliſhed by the
Oriental nations. The fleſh of the hare, it is
true, as well as that of the hog, was interdicted
by the law of Mahomet, and ſtill more antiently
by the Jewiſh law. But it was much eſteemed
by the Greeks and Romans: <hi>Inter quadrupedes,
gloria prima Lepus</hi>
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Martial.</note>. It muſt, indeed, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
that not only the fleſh, but the blood of
this animal is excellent. The fat contributes
nothing to the delicacy of the fleſh; for the
hare, in his natural ſtate of perfect liberty, is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0195500104:193"/>
never fat; but, when fed in the houſe, he often
dies merely by the load of fat he acquires.</p>
               <p>The hunting of the hare is the amuſement,
and not unfrequently the ſole occupation of the
idle: As it requires little apparatus or expence,
and is even uſeful, it is a diverſion univerſally
agreeable. In the mornings and evenings, the
hunter watches, at the edges of the wood, the
going out or returning of the hares. During
the day, he ſearches for them in their forms.
When the air is clear and the ſun brilliant, an
expert hunter will diſcover, at a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
a hare that has been chanced, by the fumes
which ariſe from its body. Conducted by this
mark, I have ſeen men, whoſe eyes were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to this kind of obſervation, part from
their company, and go to the diſtance of half a
league to kill a hare in its ſeat. Hares allow a
very near approach, if they are not advanced
upon directly, but by a winding and ſeemingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive
motion. They are more afraid of dogs
than of men, and ſtart ſooner when they hear
or perceive a dog. Though the hares run faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the dogs; yet, as they never fly ſtraight
out, but double about the place where they were
ſtarted, the grey hounds, who hunt more by the
eye than the ſcent, generally overtake and kill
them. In ſummer, they frequent the fields, the
vineyards in autumn, and the woods or coppices
in winter; and, in all ſeaſons, they may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and chaced by hounds. They may alſo be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0195500104:194"/>
taken by birds of prey. A perpetual war is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on againſt them by owls, buzzards, eagles,
foxes, wolves, and men. So numerous are their
enemies, that they eſcape only by chance, and
are rarely allowed to enjoy the ſmall protion of
time allotted them by Nature.</p>

                  <p>It is univerſally known, that hares make forms,
and burrow not in the ground, like rabbits. But
I have been informed by an able naturaliſt, M.
Hettlinger, ſuperintendant of the Pyrennean
mines, that, in the mountains in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

               <p>AS the hare and rabbit, though very ſimilar
both in external form and internal ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
never intermix, they conſtitute two diſtinct
ſpecies. However, as it has been maintained by
hunters<note n="†" place="bottom">La Venerie de du Fouilloux, p. 100.</note>, that male hares, in the rutting ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
purſue and cover female rabbits, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to diſcover what would reſult from this
union. For this purpoſe, I reared together male
rabbits and female hares, and female rabbits and
male hares. But nothing was produced from
theſe trials. I only learned from them, that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0195500104:198"/>
theſe animals, though very ſimilar in form, are
ſo different in their natures, as to be incapable of
producing mules. I put a young hare and a
young female rabbit in the ſame apartment; but
they lived not together three months. As ſoon
as they acquired a little ſtrength, they became
mortal enemies; and their continual wars ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in the death of the hare. Of two male
hares farther advanced in life, which I confined
ſeparately with a female rabbit, one ſuffered the
ſame fate; and the other, which was very ſtrong,
and very ardent, perpetually tormented the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
with attempts to cover her, and at laſt killed
her by wounds, or by too violent careſſes. I
made ſimilar trials with three or four male rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
and an equal number of female hares; but
the latter died in a ſtill ſhorter time. Though
nothing was produced, I am inclined to think
that they ſometimes actually coupled. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
at leaſt, that, notwithſtanding the reſiſtance
of the female, the male was gratified: And it
was more reaſonable to expect fruit from theſe
mixtures than from that of the rabbit and hen,
which, according to a certain author, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<hi>chickens covered with hair, or rabbits co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with feathers</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See l'art d'elever des poulets.</note>. This ridiculous conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was drawn from a vicious male rabbit, which,
having no female, uſed a hen in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as he would any other moveable. It was
extremely improbable, that two ſpecies, ſo
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0195500104:199"/>
remote from each other, ſhould be fertile, while
nothing reſults from the union of the hare and
rabbit, whoſe ſpecies are ſo very analogous.</p>
               <p>The fecundity of the rabbit is ſtill greater than
that of the hare. Without believing, with Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
that, from a ſingle pair put upon an iſland,
ſix millions were found at the end of one year,
it is certain that theſe animals multiply ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly
in a country which is commodious for
them, that the produce of the earth is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to afford them ſubſiſtence. They devour
herbs, roots, grain, fruits, and even young trees
and ſhrubs; and, if not furniſhed with dogs
and ferrets, the inhabitants would be obliged to
deſert theſe countries. The rabbit not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
more frequently, and in greater number
than the hare, but has likewiſe more reſources
for eſcaping his enemies. He eaſily abſtracts
himſelf from the obſervation of man. The
holes which he digs in the earth, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
during the day, and impregnates his mate,
protect him from the ravages of the wolf, the
fox, and birds of prey. Here the whole family
live in perfect ſecurity. The females nouriſh
their young about two months, and never allow
them to go out of their retreat till they are able
to ſhift for themſelves. By this means, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
all the dangers of youth; while more hares,
on the contrary, are deſtroyed during this period
than in all the after part of their lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0195500104:200"/>
This management is alone ſufficient to prove
that the rabbit is ſuperior in ſagacity to the
hare. The ſtructure of both is the ſame, and
might enable them equally to dig retreats in the
earth. Both are equally timid; but the talents
of the one being weaker than thoſe of the other,
he contents himſelf with forming a ſeat on the
ſurface of the ground, where he remains perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
expoſed; while the rabbit, endowed with
a ſuperior inſtinct, digs for himſelf an aſylum in
the earth. This labour is unqueſtionably the
effect of ſentiment; for domeſtic rabbits never
give themſelves the trouble of digging. They
diſpenſe with digging retreats, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that domeſtic birds diſpenſe with building
neſts, becauſe they are equally ſheltered from
the inconveniencies and dangers to which wild
birds and wild rabbits are continually liable. It
has often been remarked, that, when a warren is
attempted to be repleniſhed with domeſtic rabbits,
both they and their offspring remain, like the
hares, upon the ſurface; and that they never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to dig holes for their protection, till after
they have endured many hardſhips, and paſſed
through ſeveral generations.</p>
               <p>The colours of the domeſtic rabbit vary, like
thoſe of all other domeſtic animals; for we have
white, black, brown, and ſpotted rabbits. The
black rabbits are rarer than the white, brown, or
variegated kinds. All wild rabbits are brown;
and, even among the domeſtic ones, it is ſtill the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0195500104:201"/>
predominant colour; for, in every litter, though
both male and female be white, or both black,
or the one white and the other black, ſome of
the young are always brown. It is ſeldom that
above two or three reſemble the parents. But
the brown rabbits, though in a domeſtic ſtate,
generally produce young of their own colour
only; and it is very rare, and as by accident,
that they bring forth white, black, or mixed
kinds.</p>
               <p>At the age of five or ſix months, theſe animals
are capable of procreating. They are ſaid to be
conſtant in their amours; and, after attaching
themſelves to a particular female, generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
quit her. The female is almoſt perpetually
in a condition for receiving the male. She goes
with young thirty or thirty-one days, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
from four to eight at a litter. Like the
female hare, ſhe has a double uterus, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
may bring forth at two different times.
Superfoetations, however, ſeem to be leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in this ſpecies than in that of the hare.
This circumſtance may, perhaps, be owing to
the conſtancy of the females, and to their indulging
in fewer adventures and unſeaſonable embraces.</p>
               <p>Some days before bringing forth, they dig a
new hole, not in a ſtraight line, but angular; at
the bottom of which they make an excavation;
and then pull great quantities of hair off their
bellies, and make a bed of it for the reception of
their young. During the two firſt days, they
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0195500104:202"/>
never leave their offspring: They never go out
but when preſſed with hunger, and return as ſoon
as they have filled their ſtomach, which they do
with ſurpriſing quickneſs. In this manner they
tend and ſuckle their young for more than ſix
weeks, during which the father has no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them. He never enters the hole dug
by the mother; and the female, when ſhe leaves
her young, frequently ſhuts up the mouth of the
hole with earth diluted in her own urine. But,
when they begin to come to the mouth of the
hole, and to eat groundſel, or other herbs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to them by the mother, the father ſeems
to know them: He takes them between his
paws, ſmooths their hair, and licks their eyes.
Each of them, one after another, equally partakes
of his care and attention. He receives, at the
ſame time, many careſſes from the mother;
and, in a few days afterwards, ſhe is generally
impregnated.</p>
               <p>I received the following remarks from M. le
Chapt du Moutier, who has amuſed himſelf for
ſeveral years in rearing rabbits: 'I began,' ſays
he, 'with only one male and one female. The
male was perfectly white, and the female
brown. In their poſterity, which was very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
the brown greatly predominated; there
was a conſiderable number of them white and
mixed, and ſome black. When the female is
in ſeaſon, the male ſeldom quits her. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
is ſo vigorous and ardent, that I have
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0195500104:203"/>
ſeen him embrace the female five or ſix times
in leſs than an hour. In the time of coition,
the female lies flat on her belly, with her four
paws ſtretched out; and ſhe utters ſmall cries,
which rather indicate pleaſure than pain. Their
manner of coupling reſembles that of the cats,
with this difference, that the male bites the
neck of the female with leſs violence. Theſe
animals pay much reſpect to their fathers,
which I diſcovered by the great deference my
rabbits entertained for their original father, who
was eaſily diſtinguiſhed by his whiteneſs, being
the only male of this colour which I preſerved.
The family ſoon increaſed: But thoſe who had
likewiſe become fathers, were always ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to their firſt ſire. Whenever they fought,
either for females or food, the grandfather ran
up to them with full ſpeed; and, as ſoon as they
perceived him, order was re-eſtabliſhed. If
he ſurpriſed them in the act, he firſt ſeparated
the combatants, and then gave them an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
puniſhment. I had ſtill a farther proof
of his dominion over his poſterity. Having
accuſtomed them to retire into their apartment
upon the blowing of a whiſtle, when I gave
the ſignal, however diſtant they might be, the
grandfather put himſelf at their head, and,
though he arrived firſt, he allowed them all to
paſs before, and entered laſt himſelf. I fed
them with bran, hay, and a good deal of juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0195500104:204"/>
of this laſt, they eat the berries, the leaves,
the bark, and leave nothing but the wood.
This food gave a fine flavour to their fleſh,
and made it equally good as that of the wild
rabbit.'</p>
               <p>Theſe animals live eight or nine years. As
they paſs the greateſt part of their lives in holes,
where they enjoy perfect tranquillity, they grow
much fatter than hares. Their fleſh differs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
both in colour and taſte. The fleſh of the
young rabbit is very delicate; but that of the
old is dry and hard. As I formerly remarked,
they are originally natives of warm climates.
They were known to the Greeks<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſt. Hiſt. animal. lib. 1. cap. 1.</note>; Greece and
Spain<note n="†" place="bottom">Plin. Hiſt. Nat. lib. 8.</note> ſeem to be the only places of Europe

they cannot be reared in houſes, and they periſh

they have the ſame appetites, the ſame
taſte for animal food, and becauſe, in obedience
to this unavoidable and neceſſary deſire, they
ſometimes diſpute with him that prey which he
would engroſs for the gratification of his inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
appetite; for man always ſacrifices more
to his intemperance than to his real wants. Born
to deſtroy the ſubordinate races of animals, he
would exhauſt all Nature, if, by a fecundity ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to his depredations, ſhe did not repair the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0195500104:212"/>
perpetual havock he makes. But death is only
the miniſter of life, and deſtruction is the parent
of reproduction. However great, therefore, the
waſte made by man and the carnivorous animals,
the fund or total quantity of life is never dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;
for, in proportion to their premature
deſtruction, freſh births are produced.</p>
               <p>Large animals conſtitute but a ſmall part of
life: The earth teems with the ſmaller tribes.
Every plant, every grain, every particle of orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
matter, contains millions of animated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.
Vegetables ſeem to be the great fund of
ſubſiſtence; but this fund, however inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
would hardly be ſufficient to the ſtill more
numerous tribes of inſects. Their fecundity,
which is equally great, and often quicker than
the reproduction of plants, indicates the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
of their numbers: For plants are only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
every year; but a ſingle ſeaſon gives
birth to ſeveral generations of inſects, eſpecially
among the minuter tribes. Their multiplication,
therefore, if they were not devoured by other
animals, would exceed that of vegetables. But
many inſects feed upon other inſects: Some
tribes, as the ſpeeders, devour indifferently their
own as well as many other ſpecies; the whole
are eaten by the birds; and the wild and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
fowls ſerve for nouriſhment to man, or
become the prey of carnivorous animals. Thus
violent deaths are equally neceſſary as natural
ones: They are both modes of deſtruction and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0195500104:213"/>
of reproduction; the one continues Nature in
perpetual youth, and the other preſerves the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of her productions, and limits the number
of ſpecies. Both are effects depending upon ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
cauſes: Every individual drops at the end
of a determined period; or, if prematurely cut
off, it was becauſe he was ſuperfluous. How
many flowers are cropped in the ſpring? What
numberleſs beings are extinguiſhed the moment
they begin to exiſt? How many germs are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated
before they are unfolded? Man and
the carnivorous animals feed upon individuals
either completely formed, or about to exiſt.
Fleſh, eggs, ſeeds, and germs of every ſpecies,
conſtitute their ordinary nouriſhment. This
waſte alone might limit the exuberance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Let us attend to one of thoſe inferior ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that ſerve for nouriſhment to others. The
herrings, for example, preſent themſelves in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads
to our fiſhers; and, after feeding all the
monſters of the northern ocean, they furniſh
ſubſiſtence to Europe during a certain part of the
year. If incredible numbers of them were not
devoured by other animals, what would be the
effects of ſuch an amazing multiplication? They
alone would cover the whole ſurface of the ſea.
But, by their numbers, they would ſoon injure
and deſtroy each other. For want of ſufficient
nouriſhment, their fecundity would diminiſh.
Contagion and famine would produce the ſame
effects as the preſent conſumption; the number
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0195500104:214"/>
of theſe animals would by no means increaſe;
but the number of thoſe who feed upon them
would greatly diminiſh. And, as the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
may be applied to any other ſpecies, they
muſt of neceſſity prey upon one another: Hence
the killing of animals is both a lawful and an
innocent practice, becauſe it is founded in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and they hold their exiſtence under that
ſeemingly hard condition.</p>
               <p>It muſt be allowed, however, that the motives
which have raiſed doubts concerning this matter,
do honour to humanity. Animals, at leaſt thoſe
who are endowed with ſenſes, and are compoſed
of fleſh and blood, are ſenſitive beings: Like us,
they are capable of pleaſure, and ſubject to pain.
To ſacrifice unneceſſarily thoſe animals who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
or live with us, and who, like man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
ſymptoms of pain when injured, indicates
a cruel inſenſibility; for thoſe whoſe nature dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
greatly from ours, cannot affect us. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
pity is founded on the analogy which takes
place between us and the object that ſuffers, and
the degree of it is proportioned to the nearneſs
of this conformity or reſemblance in ſtructure.
The word <hi>compaſſion</hi> implies a diviſion of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
In man, the ſentiment of pity belongs more
to the body than to the mind; and the animals
are alſo ſuſceptible of it. They are moved by
the voice of pain; they run to ſuccour each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
they recoil at the view of a dead body of
their own ſpecies. Thus horror and pity are not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0195500104:215"/>
ſo much paſſions of the mind, as natural affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
depending on the ſenſibility of the body,
and ſimilarity of ſtructure. This emotion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ought to diminiſh in proportion as different
animals recede from each other in their nature
and conformation. The beating of a dog, or
the killing of a lamb, excite our compaſſion:
But we feel no emotion when a tree is felled or
an oyſter ſwallowed.</p>
               <p>Animals, whoſe organization reſembles that
of man, muſt have ſimilar ſenſations; and the
livelineſs of theſe ſenſations muſt be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the activity and perfection of their ſenſes.
Thoſe, on the other hand, whoſe ſenſes are blunt,
cannot have exquiſite feelings; and thoſe who
are deprived of any organ of ſenſe, muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
want the correſpondent ſenſations. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a neceſſary effect of the exerciſe of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
We formerly proved<note n="*" place="bottom">Sec above, diſcourſe on the nature of animals, vol. 3. p. 208.</note>, that, whatever be
the organization of an animal, if it be endowed
with ſentiment, it muſt exhibit its feelings by
external movements. Thus plants, though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
organized, are inſenſible beings, as well as
thoſe animals who have no apparent motion. In
the ſame manner, animals, who, like the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
plant, only move their bodies, but are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of progreſſive motion, have very little
ſentiment; and even thoſe who are endowed
with the power of moving progreſſively, but
whoſe actions, like thoſe of automations, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0195500104:216"/>
limited in number, and always perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſame manner, have only a ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſentiment, which is confined to a few
objects. In the human ſpecies, there are many
automatons: Education, and the mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of ideas, by means of ſocial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
augment both the quantity and the viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of our ſentiments. What a vaſt difference,
in this reſpect, between a ſavage and a civilized
man, between a female Hottentot and a woman
of faſhion? Among the animals, in like manner,
thoſe who live in a domeſtic ſtate have their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
improved by their frequent intercourſe with
man; while thoſe who remain wild preſerve
only their natural ſenſibility, which is often
more certain, but always more confined than that
which is acquired by education and example.</p>
               <p>Beſides, conſidering ſentiment entirely as a
natural faculty, independent of the movements
produced by it, we may ſtill aſcertain its differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
degrees by phyſical relations, to which too
little attention has hitherto been given. To poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
a high degree of ſenſibility, the animated
body muſt form a whole, not only ſenſible in all
its parts, but ſo conſtructed that theſe parts inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
correſpond with each other, in ſuch a
manner, that an impreſſion made upon one,
muſt neceſſarily be communicated to all the reſt.
There muſt alſo be a common centre, upon which
the various impreſſions or vibrations muſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
and this centre muſt, like a fulcrum,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0195500104:217"/>
re-act, and reflect all theſe movements. Thus
man, and thoſe animals who reſemble him moſt
in organization, will be the moſt ſenſible beings.
Thoſe, on the contrary, who form not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
a whole, whoſe parts have a leſs intimate
correſpondence, who have ſeveral centres of
feeling, and who, under the ſame covering, ſeem
not to include one perfect animal, but various
centres of exiſtence ſeparate from each other,
are beings of much leſs ſenſibility. When a
polypus is cut in pieces, each diviſion lives ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately;
the head of a waſp, after being divided
from the body, lives, moves, and even eats as
formerly; a lizard, though cut aſunder, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deprived of motion nor of feeling; the
limbs of a lobſter are renewed after amputation;
the heart of a turtle continues to beat long after
being cut out of the body; the principal viſcera
of inſects, as the heart and lungs, make not a
whole in the centre of theſe animals, but extend
along the body, and form a ſucceſſion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected
hearts and wind-pipes: All theſe, and
ſimilar animals, whoſe organization is ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from that of man, have little ſentiment.</p>
               <p>In man, and in the animals which reſemble him,
the diaphragm appears to be the centre of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
It is upon this nervous part, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
the impreſſion of pain and of pleaſure, that
all the movements of the ſenſible ſyſtem are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted.
The diaphragm makes a tranſverſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the body into two equal parts, the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0195500104:218"/>
of which includes the heart and lungs, and
the inferior contains the ſtomach and inteſtines.
This membrane is endowed with ſuch an extreme
ſenſibility, and is ſo neceſſary to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and propagation of feeling, that the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
wound, whether in its centre or circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
is always accompanied with convulſions,
and often with death. The brain, therefore,
which has been conſidered as the ſeat of ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is by no means the centre of ſentiment;
for it may be wounded, and even parts of it cut
away, without deſtroying the animal.</p>
               <p>Senſation, therefore, ought to be diſtinguiſhed
from ſentiment. Senſation is only a vibration,
or impreſſion on the ſenſe; but ſentiment is the
ſame ſenſation rendered agreeable and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the propagation of the vibration through
the ſyſtem. The eſſential characteriſtic of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
is pleaſure or pain; for all other move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
though they paſs within us, are totally
indifferent, and do not affect us. All the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
motions, and the exerciſe of every animal
force, depend on ſentiment, which only acts in
proportion as it is affected. The diaphragm,
therefore, which we conſider as the centre of
ſentiment, is alſo the centre of force, or common
fulcrum upon which every force is exerted.</p>
               <p>All lively emotions, whether pleaſant or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
ſickneſs, fainting, and every ſenſation that
has become agreeable or diſagreeable, are felt
internally in the region of the diaphragm. In
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0195500104:219"/>
the brain, on the contrary, there is no indication
of ſentiment. We feel only pure ſenſations in
the head. We can, indeed, recal any ſenſation,
whether agreeable or diſagreeable; and, if this
operation, which is performed in the head, be
followed by a real and lively ſentiment, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
feel the impreſſion of it in the region
of the diaphragm. Thus, in the foetus, where
this membrane is not exerciſed, there is no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,
or at leaſt it is ſo feeble as to produce
no effect; for the little motions of a foetus are
mechanical, and have no dependence either on
ſenſation or on the will.</p>
               <p>Whatever be the nature of that matter, which
ſerves as a vehicle to ſentiment, and gives riſe
to muſcular motion, we know that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
by the nerves, and that it is inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
communicated from one extremity of the
ſyſtem to the other. We know not how this
movement is performed, whether by vibrations
like thoſe of elaſtic cords, or by a ſubtile fire ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
to that of electricity, which reſides not
only in animated and unanimated bodies, but is
perpetually regenerated by the motion of the
heart and lungs, by the friction of the blood in
the arteries, and alſo by the action of external
cauſes upon the organs of ſenſe. It is certain,
however, that the nerves and membranes are the
only ſenſible parts of an animal body. The
blood, the lymph, the fat, the bones, the fleſh,
and all the other ſolids and fluids are, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0195500104:220"/>
totally inſenſible. The brain is a ſoft
unelaſtic ſubſtance, and, of courſe, incapable of
producing or of propagating the vibrations of
ſentiment. The meninges, on the contrary,
which ſerve as an envelope or covering to all the
nerves, are exceedingly ſenſible. Like the nerves,
the meninges originate in the head, and, like
them, they divide into branches, and extend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with their moſt minute ramifications. They
may be regarded as nerves rendered flat; for
they are of the ſame ſubſtance, have nearly the
ſame degree of elaſticity, and form a neceſſary
part of the ſenſible ſyſtem. If the head, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be the ſeat of ſenſation, it muſt reſide in
the meninges, and not in the medullary part of
the brain, the ſubſtance of which is entirely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
               <p>The opinion, that the brain is the fountain of
ſenſation, and the centre of all ſenſibility, aroſe
from this circumſtance, that the whole nerves,
which are the organs of ſenſation, terminate in
the brain; and hence it was regarded as the only
part fitted to receive every impreſſion or vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This ſuppoſition appeared ſo ſimple and
ſo natural, that the phyſical impoſſibility which
it implies, though abundantly evident, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
attended to: How can an inſenſible part, a
ſoft inactive ſubſtance, ſuch as the brain, be it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the inſtrument of all ſenſation and motion?
How can this ſoft inſenſible ſubſtance not only
receive impreſſions, but retain them for a long
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0195500104:221"/>
time, and propagate vibrations through all the
ſolid and ſenſible parts of the body? It may,
perhaps, be replied, with Deſcartes and Peyronie,
that the principle of ſenſation reſides not in the
brain, but in the pineal gland, or in the cortical
ſubſtance. But, from examining the parts of
the brain, it is apparent, that neither the pineal
gland nor cortical ſubſtance contain nerves: They
are ſurrounded with the inſenſible part of the
brain, and ſo ſeparated from the nerves, that they
can receive none of their movements. Hence
theſe ſuppoſitions, as well as the former, fall to
the ground.</p>
               <p>But what is the uſe, what are the functions
of this noble and principal part of the body? Is
not the brain found in every animal? Is it not
larger in man, in the quadrupeds, and in the
birds, who have all a great deal of ſentiment,
than in fiſhes, inſects, and other animals which
have little ſentiment? When compreſſed, is
not all motion ſuſpended? If this part is not the
principle of action, why is it ſo eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary?
Why is it even proportioned, in every
ſpecies of animals, to the quantity of ſentiment
they poſſeſs?</p>
               <p>Theſe queſtions, however difficult they may
appear, admit of eaſy ſolutions. Upon an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
and unprejudiced examination, the brain,
as well as the medulla oblongata, and ſpinal
marrow, which is a prolongation of the brain,
are only a ſpecies of mucilage, and hardly orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0195500104:222"/>
We diſcover in it, indeed, the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of ſmall arteries, which terminate there in
vaſt numbers, and carry no blood, but only a
white nutritious lymph. Theſe minute arteries,
or lymphatic veſſels, when ſeparated from the
brain by maceration, appear like very fine threads.
The nerves, on the contrary, never penetrate the
ſubſtance of the brain, but terminate on its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;
but they firſt loſe their ſolidity and elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
and their extremities next the brain are ſoft,
and almoſt mucilaginous. Hence the brain,
which is nouriſhed by the lymphatic arteries,
furniſhes, in its turn, nutriment to the nerves,
which ought to be conſidered as a ſpecies of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation
iſſuing from the brain in trunks and
branches, which afterwards divide into an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number of ramifications. The brain is to
the nerves, what the ſoil is to plants: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of the nerves are the roots which, in
every vegetable, are more tender and ſoft than
the trunk or branches. They contain a ductile
matter proper for the growth and nouriſhment
of the nervous tree. This ductile matter they
derive from the ſubſtance of the brain itſelf, to
which the arteries perpetually carry the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
ſupplies of lymph. The brain, therefore,
inſtead of being the origin of ſenſation, or the
principle of ſentiment, is only an organ of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and nutrition, but a very eſſential organ;
for, without it, the nerves would neither grow
nor be ſupported.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0195500104:223"/>
The brain is largeſt in man, quadrupeds, and
birds; becauſe the quantity of nerves is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than in the fiſhes and inſects, whoſe ſentiment,
for this reaſon, is feeble: The latter have a ſmall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, proportioned to the ſmall quantity of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it has to nouriſh. On this occaſion, I
must remark, that man's brain, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
is not proportionally larger than that of
any other animal: There are ſpecies of monkeys
and of the cetaceous tribes which have larger
brains, in proportion to the ſize of their bodies,
than man: And this fact likewiſe proves, that
the brain is neither the ſeat of ſenſation, nor the
principle of ſentiment; for, if this were the caſe,
theſe animals would have finer ſenſations and
more ſentiment than the human ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Plants abſorb not the ſolid parts of earth
or water: Theſe parts muſt be reduced by
heat into thin vapours, before they can be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed
by the roots. In the ſame manner, the
nerves are nouriſhed by the ſubtile moiſture of
the brain, which is abſorbed by their extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or roots, and from thence conveyed to all
the branches of the ſenſitive ſyſtem. This ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
as formerly remarked, forms a whole, all
the parts of which have ſuch an intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection,
that none of them can be injured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wounding the whole. The ſlighteſt irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a ſmall nerve, is ſufficient to convulſe the
whole body; and the pain and conſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">
                     <desc>•••…</desc>
                  </gap>ions
cannot be cured but by cutting the nerve
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0195500104:224"/>
above the injured part; and then all the parts
upon which this nerve was diſtributed, become
for ever immoveable and inſenſible. The brain
ought not to be regarded as an organic portion
of the nervous ſyſtem; becauſe it has not the
ſame properties, nor conſiſts of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
being neither ſolid, nor elaſtic, nor ſenſible.
I acknowledge, that, when compreſſed, ſenſation
ceaſes. But this alone proves it to be a body
foreign to the nervous ſyſtem, which, acting by
its gravity on the extremities of the nerves, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and benumbs them, in the ſame manner as a
weight applied to the arm, leg, or any other part
of the body, benumbs the nerves, and annihilates
their ſenſation. It is true, this ceſſation of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by compreſſion, is only a ſuſpenſion or a
benumbing, which vaniſhes the moment the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is removed, and ſenſation and motion
are again renewed. I farther acknowledge, that,
by tearing the medullary ſubſtance of the brain,
convulſions, privation of feeling, and death itſelf,
will enſue. But theſe effects are produced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the nerves are entirely deranged, and the
whole of them materially injured in their very
ſource.</p>
               <p>To theſe arguments particular facts might be
added, which would equally demonſtrate that
the brain is neither the centre of ſentiment, nor
the ſeat of ſenſation. We have ſeen animals,
and even children, born without head or brain,
and yet had ſentiment, motion, and life. There
are whole claſſes of animals, as inſects and worms,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0195500104:225"/>
in whom the brain is not perceptible, having
only a part correſponding to the medulla oblon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata
and ſpinal marrow. It is, therefore, more
rational to place the ſeat of ſenſation in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
marrow, which no animal wants, than in the
brain, which is not an univerſal part, common to
all ſenſitive beings.</p>
               <p>The great obſtacle to the advancement of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
knowledge, lies not in the objects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but in our manner of conſidering them.
Man's body, however complicated, is more ſimple
than his ideas. It is leſs difficult to ſee Nature
as ſhe is, than to know her in the dreſs ſhe is
exhibited to us. She only wears a veil; but we
give her a maſk. We conceal her with prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
We ſuppoſe that ſhe operates as we act and
think. Her actions, however, are evident; but
our thoughts are obſcure. To her operations
we transfer the abſtractions of our own minds.
We judge of her deſigns by our own views;
and we perpetually blend her works which are
uniform, her facts which are always certain, with
the fluctuating illuſions of our own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not here of ſyſtems purely arbitrary, or
of frivolous and imaginary hypotheſes, but of the
methods generally employed in the inveſtigation
of Nature. Even the method of experiment has
produced more errors than truths. This method,
though the moſt certain, requires great dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of management: A ſmall deviation either leads
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0195500104:226"/>
to barren regions, or to rare and obſcure objects.
We nevertheleſs aſſemble them together, and
aſcribe to them general relations and common
properties; and, as mankind paſs and repaſs on
the crooked paths which have been formed, the
road appears to be clear and beaten. Though
it terminates in nothing, the whole world fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
the method is adopted, and the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
derived from it are received as fixed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
I might demonſtrate this doctrine by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the origin of what are called <hi>principles</hi>
in all the ſciences, both abſtract and real: In the
former, the general baſis of the principle is
abſtraction, or one or two ſuppoſitions: In
the latter, the principles are only conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
good or bad, of the methods which have been
obſerved. I ſhall here limit myſelf to the ſcience
of anatomy: Did not the firſt man who, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to a repugnance of nature, opened a human
body, believe that, by diſſecting and examining
its different parts, he would ſoon diſcover its
ſtructure, mechaniſm, and functions? But, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found the ſubject to be infinitely more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
than he imagined, he was ſoon obliged
to renounce his pretenſions, and to inſtitute a
method, not for diſtinguiſhing and judging, but
ſolely in order that he might ſee the parts in a
certain train or order. Many ages were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to bring this method to any degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and it alone ſtill occupies the attention
of our moſt accompliſhed anatomiſts. This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
however, is not the ſcience, but only the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0195500104:227"/>
road which ought to lead to it, and which perhaps
might have led to it, if, inſtead of travelling al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in the ſame narrow path, anatomiſts had
extended the tract, and compared the human
body with that of the other animals. What
real knowledge can be derived from a ſingle
object? Is not every ſcience founded on the
compariſon of ſimilar and different objects, of
their analogous or oppoſite properties, and of
all their relative qualities? Abſolute know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
if it has an exiſtence, exceeds the powers
of man: We can only judge by the relations
of things. When ſolely occupied with the method
of inveſtigating a ſubject, and when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it independent of what is analogous or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from it, we can never arrive at real
knowledge, and far leſs riſe to any general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple:
In this caſe, we can only invent names,
and make deſcriptions of the object, and of all
its parts. Thus, though human bodies have
been diſſected for three thouſand years, anatomy
is ſtill nothing but à nomenclature; and hardly
any advances have been made toward the real
object, which is the knowledge of the animal
oeconomy. Beſides, the method itſelf is ſtill
imperfect, though it ought to be clear and ſimple,
ſince it depends on inſpection, and has no end
but that of denominations? As this nominal
knowledge has been miſtaken for ſcience, ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts
have been anxious to augment the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of names, inſtead of limiting the number of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0195500104:228"/>
objects. They have loaded the ſubject with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
and fruitleſs details. They were inclined to
diſcover diſcrepances, where every thing was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
In creating new names, they imagined
they were exhibiting new objects; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of a minute part, which had been either
overlooked or neglected by former anatomiſts,
was dignified with the appellation of a <hi>diſcovery.</hi>
Even the names themſelves being frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubſtituted in place of the objects, with which
they have no relation, have only ſerved to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the confuſion. Are not the <hi>nates</hi> and <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes</hi>
ſmall parts of the brain ſimilar to the whole,
and unworthy to be diſtinguiſhed by particular
denominations? Theſe names, beſtowed origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
from caprice, at laſt gave riſe to new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and prejudices. Others, given to parts
which either did not exiſt, or were imperfectly
viewed, have been the ſources of freſh errors.
How many functions and uſes have been aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the pineal gland, and that pretended
void in the brain, called the <hi>fornix,</hi> while the
former is only a ſimple gland, and the exiſtence
of the latter is doubtful, being probably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the hand of the diſſector<note n="*" place="bottom">See Steno.</note>?</p>
               <p>The moſt difficult part of ſcience, therefore,
is not to know thoſe things which form the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
object of it, but to ſtrip them of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
falſe colours under which they have been
concealed, to examine the foundation and effects
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0195500104:229"/>
of the method employed by former inquirers, to
reject every arbitrary arrangement, and, in fine,
to endeavour to detect every error or prejudice
that has been adopted. All theſe precautions
are neceſſary to uncover Nature; but, to know
her, we have only to compare her with herſelf.
In the animal oeconomy, her appearance is very
myſterious, not only becauſe the ſubject is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex,
but becauſe, having neglected thoſe modes
of compariſon, which alone could afford light,
we have been left to wander in the darkneſs of
vague hypotheſes. The human body has been
deſcribed in millions of volumes; while the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
of the other animals has been almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
neglected. In the human ſubject, we
have diſtinguiſhed, named, and deſcribed the
moſt minute parts; while we are ignorant whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe, or even parts of greater magnitude
and improtance, exiſt in other animals. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
functions have been aſcribed to particular
organs, without knowing whether the ſame
functions are not performed in other beings,
though deprived of theſe organs. So that, in the
different explications of the animal oeconomy,
we labour under the double diſadvantage of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
commenced with the moſt complicated ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and of reaſoning concerning this ſubject
without the aid of analogy.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of this work, we have obſerved
a very different method. Uniformly comparing
Nature with herſelf, we have traced her in her
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0195500104:230"/>
relations, in her diſcrepances, and in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes.
To mention here only thoſe parts rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to the animal oeconomy, of which we have
had occaſion to treat, as the generation, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the movements, the ſentiment, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of animals, the reader will eaſily perceive,
that, after all the labour beſtowed in diſcarding
falſe ideas, in rooting out eſtabliſhed prejudices,
and in ſeparating truth from arbitrary conceits,
the only art we have employed is that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.
If we have ſucceeded in throwing
light upon thoſe ſubjects, it muſt be aſcribed not
ſo much to ingenuity or labour, as to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
we have followed, and which we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to render as general as our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
would permit. Before giving general ideas,
we have invariably exhibited the particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults,
or effects.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now content ourſelves with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a few facts, which will be ſufficient to prove
that man, in the ſtate of nature, was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined
to live upon herbs, grain, or fruits; but
that, in every period of his exiſtence, he, as well
as moſt other animals, eagerly deſired to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
himſelf with fleſh.</p>
               <p>The Pythagorean diet, though extolled by
antient and modern philoſophers, and even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
by certain phyſicians, was never
indicated by Nature. In the golden age, man
was innocent as the dove; his food was acorns,
and his beverage pure water from the fountain:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0195500104:231"/>
Finding every where abundant ſubſiſtence, he
felt no anxieties, but lived independent, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in peace both with himſelf and the other
animals. But he no ſooner forgot his native
dignity, and ſacrificed his liberty to the bonds of
ſociety, than war and the iron age took place
of that of gold and of peace. Cruelty, and an
inſatiable appetite for fleſh and blood, were the
firſt fruits of a depraved nature, the corruption
of which was completed by the invention of
manners and of arts.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the reproaches which, in all periods,
have been thrown upon man, in a ſtate of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
by certain auſtere and ſavage philoſophers:
Flattering their private pride, by the humiliation
of the whole ſpecies, they have exhibited this
unnatural picture, which has no value but in
the contraſt: To hold out to man chimerical
ideas of happineſs, may, perhaps, be ſometimes
uſeful.</p>
               <p>Did this ſtate of ideal innocence, of exalted
temperance, of entire abſtinence from fleſh, of
perfect tranquillity, of profound peace, ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt?
Is it not a fable, where man has been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
as an animal, to give us leſſons of moral
inſtruction? Is it even poſſible to conceive the
exiſtence of virtue previous to ſociety? Does the
loſs of this ſavage ſtate merit regret? Was man,
while a wild, unſocial animal, more dignified
than the poliſhed citizen? Yes; for every evil
ſprings from ſociety; and what does it import
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0195500104:232"/>
whether there was virtue in a ſtate of nature, if
it gave riſe to happineſs, if man were only leſs
miſerable than in his preſent condition? Liberty,
health, ſtrength, are not theſe preferable to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy,
ſenſuality, and voluptuouſneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with ſlavery? The abſence of pain is
more eſtimable than a thouſand pleaſures: What
is happineſs, but to have nothing to deſire?</p>
               <p>If this repreſentation were juſt, they ſhould
go farther, and tells us, that it is better to vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
than to live, to have no deſires than to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
our appetites, to doze perpetually in apathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
ſlumbers, than to open our eyes to view the
beauties of Nature, and, in a word, to ſink below
the condition of brutes, or to become maſſes of
inanimate matter attached to the earth, than to
be active and ſentient beings, capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pleaſure from a thouſand ſources.</p>
               <p>But, inſtead of diſputing, let us attend to facts:
We ſee not the ideal, but the real ſtate of nature.
Is the ſavage inhabitant of the deſert a tranquil
being? Is he a happy man? For we muſt not
ſuppoſe, with a certain philoſopher, one of the
moſt ferocious cenſors of humanity<note n="*" place="bottom">Rouſſeau.</note>, that the
diſtance from man, in a pure ſtate of nature, to
the ſavage, is greater than from the ſavage to us;
that the ages elapſed before the invention of
words, have been longer than thoſe which were
neceſſary for the perfecting of ſings and of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
I have always thought, that, in reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0195500104:233"/>
concerning facts, all ſuppoſitions ought to be
baniſhed, till every thing preſented by Nature be
candidly examined. Now, we find that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
deſcend, by imperceptible degrees, from the
moſt enlightened and poliſhed nations, to people
of leſs genius and induſtry; from the latter, to
others more groſs, but ſtill ſubject to Kings
and to laws; from theſe, again, to ſavages, who
exhibit as many different ſhades as the poliſhed
nations. Some ſavages form numerous nations
ſubject to chiefs; ſmaller ſocieties of them are
governed by cuſtoms; and the moſt ſolitary and
independent ſpecies conſtitute families, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to their fathers. Thus an empire and a
monarch, a family and a father, are the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
of ſociety. Theſe extremes are likewiſe
the boundaries of nature: If they extended far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in traverſing the numberleſs ſolitudes of
the globe, we muſt have diſcovered theſe human
animals deprived of ſpeech like the monkeys, the
males ſeparated from the females, their offspring
abandoned to the elements, &amp;c. Even ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the conſtitution of the human body to be
very different from what we ſee it, and that its
growth were more rapid, it is impoſſible to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that man ever exiſted without forming fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;
becauſe, if not cheriſhed and attended
for ſeveral years, the whole children muſt have
inevitably periſhed. Whereas, other animals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the care of the mother only a few months.
This phyſical neceſſity is a perfect demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0195500104:234"/>
that the human ſpecies could neither mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
nor exiſt independent of ſociety; and that
the attachement of parents to children is natural.
This attachment muſt unite the parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
into a ſmall ſociety, which alone would be
ſufficient to accuſtom them to make certain ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
to utter certain ſounds, and inure them to
every expreſſion of ſentiment and of deſire. All
this is atteſted by facts; for the moſt ſolitary ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
have, like other men, the uſe of ſigns and
of words.</p>
               <p>Thus the ſtate of pure nature is a known ſtate:
It is that of the ſavage living in the deſert, but
living in family, knowing his children, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
known by them, uſing words, and making
himſelf underſtood. The ſavage girl picked up
in the woods of Champagne, and the man found
in the foreſts of Hanover, are not exceptions to
this doctrine. They had lived in abſolute ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
and could not, therefore, have any idea
of ſociety, or of the uſe of words: But, if they
had ever met, the propenſity of nature would
have conſtrained, and pleaſure united them. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
to each other, they would ſoon have made
themſelves underſtood; they would have firſt
learned the language of love, and then that of
tenderneſs for their offspring. Beſides, theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
ſprung from men of ſociety, and muſt have
been left in the woods at the age of four or five
years; for, before this period, they could not
have exiſted. They muſt have been old enough
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0195500104:235"/>
to be able to procure ſubſiſtence, but not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the ideas which had been communicated to
them.</p>
               <p>Let us, then, examine this man of nature, this
ſavage living in the family ſtate. If the family
proſpers, he will ſoon become the chief of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
ſociety, of which all the members will
have the ſame manners, obſerve the ſame cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
and ſpeak the ſame language. At the
third or fourth generation, new families will
ariſe, who may live ſeparately; but, being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the common bonds of cuſtoms and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
they will form a ſmall nation, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
with time, may, according to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
either become one people, or remain in
a ſtate ſimilar to that of thoſe ſavage nations
with which we are acquainted. If theſe new
men live under a mild climate, and upon a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
ſoil, they may occupy, in the full poſſeſſion
of liberty, a conſiderable ſpace, beyond which,
if they meet with nothing but deſerts, or men
equally new with themſelves, they will remain
ſavage, and become, according to circumſtances,
either friends or enemies to their neighbours.
But, when under a ſevere climate, or ungrateful
ſoil, they find themſelves pinched by numbers,
or cramped for want of room, they will make
irruptions, form colonies, and blend themſelves
with other nations, of which they will either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the conquerors or the ſlaves. Thus man,
in every ſituation, and under every climate, tends
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0195500104:236"/>
equally toward ſociety. It is the uniform effect
of a neceſſary cauſe; for, without this natural
tendency, the propagation of the ſpècies, and, of
courſe, the exiſtence of mankind, would ſoon
ceaſe.</p>
               <p>Having diſcuſſed the origin of ſociety, and
ſhown that it is founded on nature, let us next
inquire what are the appetites and taſte of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages.
In this inveſtigation, we ſhall find, that
none of them live ſolely on fruits, herbs, or
grain; that they all prefer fleſh and fiſh to other
aliments; that pure water is not pleaſant to
them; and that they endeavour either to make
for themſelves, or to procure from others, a leſs
inſipid beverage. The ſavages of the South
drink the water of the date-tree; thoſe of the
North ſwallow large draughts of whale oil; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
make fermented liquors; and the whole,
without exception, diſcover a violent paſſion for
ardent ſpirits. Their induſtry, dictated by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
and excited by their natural appetites, is
confined to the making of inſtruments for hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and fiſhing. A bow and arrows, a club, a
net, and a canoe, conſtitute the whole of their
arts, and are all deſtined to procure a ſpecies of
food correſponding to their taſte: And, what
correſponds with their taſte, muſt be agreeable to
nature; for, as formerly remarked<note n="*" place="bottom">See above, vol. 3. article Bull.</note>, man would
die of inanition, if he took not more ſubſtantial
food than herbs alone. Having but one ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0195500104:237"/>
mach and ſhort inteſtines, he could not take a
ſufficient quantity of ſuch meagre food as would
afford him proper nouriſhment. The ſame
remark is applicable to fruits and grain; for,
though corns and other grains have been high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
improved by culture, and contain a greater
quantity of organic nutritive particles, than any
of thoſe which are produced ſpontaneouſly by
nature; yet, if men were denied any other food,
he would only drag out a feeble and a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exiſtence.</p>
               <p>View thoſe ſolitary enthuſiaſts, who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from every thing that has had life, who,
from motives of ſanctity, renounce the gifts of
the Creator, fly from ſociety, and ſhut themſelves
up within ſacred walls, againſt which Nature
continually revolts: Confined in thoſe living
tombs, where they contemplate nothing but
death, their mortified viſages and hollow eyes
indicate perpetual efforts to ſupport a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
feeble, and uſeleſs exiſtence. They
take food; but their hunger never abates.
Though aided by the fervour of a romantic i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
they are enabled to reſiſt the effects
of this cruel abſtinence for a few years only,
and may be ſaid rather to die daily than to live.</p>
               <p>If man were obliged to abſtain totally from
fleſh, he could not, at leaſt in our climates, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exiſt or multiply. This diet may, perhaps,
be practicable in ſouthern countries, where the
fruits are better concocted, and the plants, roots,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0195500104:238"/>
and grains more nouriſhing. The Brahmans,
however, rather form a ſect, than a people; and
their religion, though very antient, has never
extended beyond their own climate.</p>
               <p>This religion, founded on metaphyſics, is a
ſtriking example of the lot of human opinions.
By collecting the ſcattered fragments which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
it is unqueſtionable that the ſciences have
been very antiently cultivated, and perhaps ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to a degree of perfection beyond what
they now are. It has been known, long before
the preſent aera, that all animated beings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
indeſtructible living particles, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from one body into another. This truth,
adopted at firſt by philoſophers, and afterwards
more generally diffuſed, would only preſerve its
purity during the enlightened ages. A revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of dark periods having ſucceeded, no more
of the living organic particles were remembered
than what was ſufficient to give riſe to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the living principle of animals conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
an indeſtructible whole, which ſeparated
from the body after death. To this ideal whole
they gave the name of <hi>Soul,</hi> which they ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as a being really exiſting in all animals;
and, combinging with this chimerical being, the
real, but disfigured, idea of the paſſage of living
particles, they maintained, that, after death, this
ſoul tranſmigrated ſucceſſively and perpetually
from one body to another. From this ſyſtem
man was not excepted: They quickly aſſociated
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0195500104:239"/>
morality with metaphyſics: They heſitated not
to hold, that this ſurviving being retained, in all
its tranſmigrations, its former ſentiments, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and deſires. Weak minds trembled. They
contemplated with horror the paſſage of the ſoul
from an agreeable lodging to be an inhabitant
of an unclean and lotheſome animal. Every
new fear engenders a freſh ſuperſtition. In kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an naimal, they were terrified leſt they
ſhould murder their miſtreſs or their father.
They regarded every brute as their neighbour:
And, at laſt, both from motives of tenderneſs
and of duty, they maintained that they ought
to abſtain from every thing endowed with life.
This is the origin and progreſs of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
religion of India: An origin which ſhows,
that truth, when committed to the multitude, is
ſoon disfigured; that a philoſophical opinion
never becomes popular till it has changed its
form; but that, by means of this preparation, it
may prove the baſis of a religion, the ſtability of
which will be proportioned to the univerſality
of the prejudice, and, being founded on truths
miſunderſtood, it muſt be environed with obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and, of courſe, it will have an air of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
of grandeur, and of incomprehenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
In fine, that fear, combining with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
will make this religion degenerate into
ſuperſtitious and ridiculous practices, which,
however, will take root, and produce rites that
at firſt will be ſcrupulouſly obſerved, but will ſo
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0195500104:240"/>
gradually alter with time, that even the opinion
which gave them birth, can only be traced in
falſe traditions, in proverbs, and in tales puerile
and abſurd. From hence we may conclude, that
every religion founded on human opinions is
falſe and variable; and that, to promulgate the
true religion, which depends not on the fancies
of men, and which is conſtant, unalterable, and
will always be the ſame, is the prerogative of
God alone.</p>
               <p>But, to return to our ſubject. An entire ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
from fleſh can have no effect but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble
nature. Man, to preſerve himſelf in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
plight, requires not only the uſe of this ſolid
nouriſhment, but even to vary it. To obtain
complete vigour, he muſt chooſe that ſpecies of
food which is moſt agreeable to his conſtitution;
and, as he cannot preſerve himſelf in a ſtate of
activity, but by procuring new ſenſations, he
muſt give his ſenſes their full ſtretch, and eat a
variety of meats, to prevent the diſguſt ariſing
from an uniformity of nouriſhment. But he
muſt avoid every exceſs, which is ſtill more noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than abſtinence.</p>
               <p>Thoſe animals who have but one ſtomach, and
ſhort inteſtines, are obliged, like man, to feed
upon fleſh. It is an unqueſtionable fact, that all
animals which have more ſtomachs than one, and
long inteſtines, like the cow, ſheep, goat, &amp;c.
are herbivorous, and that thoſe who have but
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0195500104:241"/>
one ſtomach and ſhort inteſtines, like men, dogs,
wolves, lions, &amp;c. are carnivorous.</p>
               <p>It muſt not, however, be concluded, that her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bivorous
animals are under a phyſical neceſſity
of feeding on herbs alone, though the carnivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
tribes can by no means ſubſiſt without fleſh.
We only maintain, that the former can be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
nouriſhed without the uſe of fleſh; not
that they would not have recourſe to this food,
if Nature had endowed them with talents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
to the purpoſes of ſeizing prey; for we
have ſeen ſheep, calves, goats, and horſes, eat,
with avidity, milk, eggs, and even fleſh, when
cut down and ſeaſoned with ſalt, though they
had not been previouſly accuſtomed to ſuch food.
We may, therefore, maintain, that the taſte for fleſh
is an appetite common to all animals, and that it
is exerted with more or leſs vehemence or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
according to their particular conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for this appetite is apparent not only in
man and the quadrupeds, but in birds, fiſhes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects,
and worms; to the laſt of which, it would
appear, all fleſh has been ultimately deſtined by
Nature.</p>
               <p>Nutrition, in every animal, is performed by
organic particles, which, after being ſeparated
from the groſs maſs of aliment, by means of
digeſtion, mingle with the blood, and are aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated
to all the parts of the body: But,
independent of this principal effect, which is
always proportioned to the quality of food, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
effect is produced, which depends on the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0195500104:242"/>
quantity or bulk of the nouriſhing ſubſtances.
The ſtomach and inteſtines conſiſt of flexible
membranes, which occupy a conſiderable ſpace
within the body. Theſe membranes, to preſerve
them in a proper ſtate of tenſion, and to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance
the action of the neighbouring organs,
require to be always partly filled. If, for want
of nouriſhment, this large ſpace be left entirely
void, the membranes, having no internal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
collapſe, and adhere to each other, which
gives riſe to weakneſs, and all the ſymptoms of
extreme want. Thus the aliments, before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
the purpoſes of nutrition, ſerve as a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt
to the body. Both their preſence and their
volume are neceſſary to maintain the equilibrium
between the internal parts, which act and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
againſt each other. When a man dies of
hunger, it is not ſo much for want of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as of a proper poiſe to the body. Thus
animals, and eſpecially the moſt voracious tribes,
when preſſed with hunger, are ſo eager to fill
the internal void, that they ſwallow earth and
ſtones. Clay has been found in the ſtomach of
a wolf; and I have ſeen ſwine eat it greedily.
Moſt birds ſwallow pebbles, &amp;c. This is not the
effect of taſte, but of neceſſity; for the moſt
craving want is, not to refreſh the blood with
new chyle, but to maintain an equilibrium in the
action of the great parts of the animal machine.</p>

               <p>THE wolf is one of thoſe animals whoſe
carnivorous appetite is ſtrongeſt. Though
he has received from Nature the means of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiying
this taſte, though ſhe has beſtowed on
him arms, craftineſs, ſtrength, agility, and every
thing neceſſary for diſcovering, ſeizing, conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and devouring his prey; yet he often dies
of hunger; becauſe men have declared war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, put a price on his head, and forced
him to fly to the foreſts, where he finds only a
few ſpecies of wild animals, who eſcape from
him by the ſwiftneſs of their courſe, and whom
he cannot ſurpriſe but by chance, or by a patient,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0195500104:244"/>
and often fruitleſs attendance at thoſe places to
which they generally reſort. He is naturally
clowniſh and daſtardly; but want makes him
ingenious, and neceſſity gives him courage.
When preſſed with famine, he braves danger;
he attacks thoſe animals which are under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of man, eſpecially ſuch as he can tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
with eaſe, as lambs, ſmall dogs, and kids;
and, when ſucceſsful in his bloody expeditions,
he returns often to the charge, till, being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
chaced, and maletreated by men and dogs, he
retires, during the day, to his den; but iſſues
forth in the night, traverſes the country, roams
about the cottages, kills all the animals which have
been left without, digs the earth under the doors,
enters with a dreadful ferocity, and puts every
living creature to death before he chooſes to
depart, and carry off his prey. When theſe in-roads
happen to be fruitleſs, he returns to the
woods, ſearches about with avidity, follows the
tract of wild beaſts, and purſues them, in the hope
that they may be ſtopped and ſeized by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wolf, and that he may be a partaker of the
ſpoil. In fine, when his hunger is extreme, he
loſes the idea of fear; he attacks women and
children, and even ſometimes darts upon men,
till, becoming perfectly furious by exceſſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions,
he generally falls a ſacrifice to pure rage
and diſtraction.</p>
               <p>The wolf, both externally and internally, has
ſo ſtrong a reſemblance to the dog, that he ſeems
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0195500104:245"/>
to have been formed upon the ſame model. But
he exhibits the ſame characters under a maſk.
The figure is ſimilar; but the reſult is directly
reverſed. Their natural diſpoſitions are ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite,
that they are not only incompatible, but
repugnant by nature, and inimical by inſtinct.
A young dog trembles at the firſt glance of a
wolf. The odour of the wolf, though new and
unknown, excites ſuch an averſion in the dog,
that he flies, and comes quivering to the feet of
his maſter. A maſtiff, who knows his own
ſtrength, though terrified at the appearance of a
wolf, attacks him with courage, endeavours to
put him to flight, and exerts every effort to get
rid of an odious object. They never meet, but
either flight or death is the conſequence. When
the wolf is ſtrongeſt, he mangles and devours
his prey. The dog, with more generoſity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
himſelf with victory; he finds no ſavory
odour in the body of a dead enemy; but aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
him to be food for the ravens, and even to
other wolves; for wolves eat the carcaſſes of
each other, and, when one is much wounded,
the others follow the blood, and aſſemble in troops
to deſpatch him.</p>
               <p>The dog, even when wild, is not a fierce ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.
He is eaſily tamed, and attaches himſelf
with fidelity to his maſter. The young wolf
may alſo be tamed; but he feels no attachments;
Nature in him is too powerful for education:
With age, he reſumes his ferocious character, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0195500104:246"/>
returns, with the firſt opportunity, to his ſavage
ſtate. Dogs, even thoſe of the moſt clowniſh
race, love to aſſociate with other animals, and
are naturally diſpoſed to accompany them: It is
by inſtinct alone, and not by education, that
they know how to conduct and guard the flocks.
The wolf, on the contrary, is an enemy to all
ſociety, and keeps no company even with thoſe
of his own ſpecies. When ſeveral wolves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
together, it is not a ſociety of peace, but of
war; it is attended with tumult and dreadful
prowlings, and indicates an attack upon ſome
large animal, as a ſtag, an ox, or a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
maſtiff. This military expedition is no
ſooner finiſhed, than they ſeparate, and each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
in ſilence to his ſolitude. There is even
little intercourſe between the males and females:
They feel the mutual attractions of love but once
a-year, and never remain long together. The
females come in ſeaſon in winter: Many males
follow the ſame female; and this aſſociation is
more bloody than the former; for they growl,
chaff, fight, and tear one another, and often ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
him that is preferred by the female. The
female commonly flies a long time, fatigues her
admirers, and retires, while they ſleep, with the
moſt alert or moſt favourite male.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſon of love continues only twelve or
fifteen days; it commences with the oldeſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males;
the young ones are not ſo early diſpoſed.
The males have no marked period, but are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0195500104:247"/>
ready at all times. They go from female
to female, according as they are in a condition to
receive them: They begin with the old females
about the end of December, and finiſh with the
young ones in the month of February or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of March. The time of geſtation is about
three months and a half<note n="*" place="bottom">See Nouveau traité de venerie, p. 75.</note>; and young whelps
are found from the end of April to the month
of July. This difference in the time of geſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between the ſhe-wolf, who carries 100 days,
and the bitch, who carries only 60 days, proves
that the wolf and dog differ as much in their
conſtitutions, and particularly in one of the chief
functions of the animal oeconomy, as they do
in their tempers. Thus, the wolf and dog have
never been regarded as the ſame animal but by
the nomenclators of natural hiſtory, who, being
acquainted with the ſurface of nature only, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
extend their views beyond their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
which are always deceitful, and often er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
even in the moſt obvious facts. The
dog and wolf cannot copulate, or produce an
intermediate race<note n="†" place="bottom">See article Dog.</note>. Their diſpoſitions are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite,
and their conſtitutions different. The
wolf lives much longer than the dog; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
brings forth but once a-year, and the latter
twice or thrice. Theſe diſtinctions are more
than ſufficient to demonſtrate the two animals
to be of very different kinds. Beſides, upon a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0195500104:248"/>
cloſer examination, we eaſily perceive, that, even
externally, the wolf differs from the dog by eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
and uniform characters. The appearance
of the head and form of the bones are by no
means the ſame. The cavity of the eye in the
wolf is placed obliquely; the orbits are inclined;
the eyes ſparkle, and ſhine in the dark; inſtead
of barking, he howls; his movements, though
quick and precipitate, are more equal and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;
his body is ſtronger, but not ſo flexible<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtotle tells us, that the neck of the wolf conſiſts of one continued bone. But this is a miſtake; for the wolf's neck is compoſed of vertebrac, and is equally flexible as that of a dog.</note>;
his members are firmer, his jaws and teeth lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and his hair coarſer and thicker.</p>
               <p>But theſe animals have a great reſemblance in
their internal ſtructure. The wolves copulate
like the dogs, and have an oſſeous penis, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with a ring, which ſwells and hinders
them from ſeparating. When the females are
about to bring forth, they ſearch for a concealed
place in the inmoſt receſſes of the foreſt. After
fixing on the ſpot, they make it ſmooth and plain
for a conſiderable ſpace, by cutting and tearing up
with their teeth all the brambles and bruſh-wood.
They then bring great quantities of moſs, and
prepare a commodious bed for their young,
which are generally five or ſix, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they bring forth ſeven, eight, and even
nine, but never leſs than three. They come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world blind, like the dogs; the mother
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0195500104:249"/>
ſuckles them ſome weeks, and ſoon learns them
to eat fleſh, which ſhe prepares for them by
tearing it into ſmall pieces. Some time after,
ſhe brings them field-mice, young hares, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges,
and living fowls. The young wolves begin
by playing with theſe animals, and at laſt worry
them; then the mother pulls off the feathers,
tears them in pieces, and gives a part to each of
her young. They never leave their den till the
end of ſix weeks or two months. They then
follow their mother, who leads them to drink in
the hollow trunk of a tree, or in ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
pool. She conducts them back to the
den, or, when any danger is apprehended, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
them to conceal themſelves elſewhere.
Though, like other females, the ſhe-wolf is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
more timid than the male; yet, when
her young are attacked, ſhe defends them with
intrepedity; ſhe loſes all ſenſe of danger, and
becomes perfectly furious. She never leaves them
till their education is finiſhed, till they are ſo
ſtrong as to need no aſſiſtance or protection, and
have acquired talents fit for rapine, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
happens in ten or twelve months after their
firſt teeth, which commonly fall out in the ſixth
month<note n="*" place="bottom">See la Venerié de du Fouilloux, p. 100.</note>, are replaced.</p>
               <p>Both males and females are capable of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
at the age of two years. The females, it
is probable, like thoſe of other ſpecies, are ſooner
mature for this operation than the males. It is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0195500104:250"/>
certain, however, that they never come in ſeaſon
before the ſecond winter after birth, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
18 or 20 months. A ſhe-wolf, which I
brought up, diſcovered no marks of love till the
third winter, or more than two years and a half.
We are aſſured by the hunters<note n="*" place="bottom">See le Nouveau traité de la Venerié, p. 276.</note>, that, in every
litter, there are more males than females; which
confirms the general remark, that, in every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
the number of males exceeds that of the
females. They likewiſe tell us, that ſome males
attach themſelves to the females, after the ſeaſon
of love is over, and accompany them till they
are about to bring forth; that then the female
ſteals off, and anxiouſly conceals her young, leſt
the father ſhould devour them immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
birth; but that, when brought forth,
he takes an affection for them, ſupplies them
with food, and, if deprived of their mother,
provides for and protects them himſelf. Theſe
facts, however, have the air of fiction, and ſeem
contrary to the natural diſpoſitions of the wolf.</p>
               <p>Wolves acquire their full growth at the end
of two or three years, and live 15 or 20 years.
This fact accords with what we have already
remarked concerning many other ſpecies, that
the time of growth is the ſeventh part of the
total duration of life. When old, wolves turn
whitiſh, and their teeth are much worn. When
full, or fatigued, they ſleep, but more during the
day than the night, and it is always a kind of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0195500104:251"/>
ſlight ſlumber. They drink often; and, in the
time of drought, when there is no water in the
hollows, or in the trunks of old trees, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
ſeveral times in a day, to the brooks or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets.
Though extremely voracious, if ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with water, they can paſs four or five days
without meat.</p>
               <p>The wolf has great ſtrength, eſpecially in the
anterior parts of the body, in the muſcles of the
neck and jaws. He carries a ſheep in his mouth,
and, at the ſame time, outruns the ſhepherds;
ſo that he can only be ſtopped or deprived of his
prey by dogs. His bite is cruel, and always
more obſtinate in proportion to the ſmallneſs of
the reſiſtance; for, when an animal can defend
itſelf, he is cautious and circumſpect. He never
fights, but from neceſſity, and not from motives
of courage. When wounded with a ball, he
cries; and yet, when deſpatching him with blud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
he complains not. He is harder, leſs
ſenſible, and more robuſt than the dog. He
runs and roams about whole days and nights;
and, of all animals, he is perhaps the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to conquer in the chace. The dog is gentle
and courageous; the wolf, though ferocious, is
timid. When he falls into a ſnare, he is ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
with terror, that he may be either kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or taken alive, without reſiſtance. He allows
himſelf to be chained, muzzled, and led where
you pleaſe, without exhibiting the leaſt ſymptom
of reſentment or diſcontent. The ſenſes of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0195500104:252"/>
wolf are excellent, but particularly his ſenſe of
ſmelling, which often extends farther than his
eye. The odour of carrion ſtrikes him at the
diſtance of more than a league. He likewiſe
ſcents live animals very far, and hunts them
a long time by following their track. When
he iſſues from the wood, he never loſes the
wind. He ſtops upon the borders of the foreſt,
ſmells on all ſides, and receives the emanations
of living or dead animals brought to him from a
diſtance by the wind. Though he prefers living
to dead animals; yet he devours the moſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
carcaſſes. He is fond of human fleſh, and,
if ſtronger, he would, perhaps, eat no other.
Wolves have been known to follow armies, to
come in troops to the field of battle, where bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are careleſsly interred, to tear them up, and
to devour them with an infatiable avidity: And,
when once accuſtomed to human fleſh, theſe
wolves ever after attack men, prefer the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
to the flock, devour women, and carry off
children. Wolves of this vitious diſpoſition are
diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Loups garoux</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See la chaſſe du loup de Gaſton Phoebus.</note>, or
wolves that ſhould be guarded againſt.</p>
               <p>Whole countries are ſometimes obliged to arm,
in order to deſtroy the wolves. Princes have
particular equipages for this ſpecies of hunting,
which is both uſeful and neceſſary. Hunters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
wolves into <hi>young, old,</hi> and <hi>very old.</hi>
They know them by the tracks of their feet.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0195500104:253"/>
The older the wolf, his feet is the larger. The
ſhe-wolf's feet are longer and more ſlender; her
heel is alſo ſmaller, and her toes thinner. A
good blood-hound is neceſſary for hunting the
wolf; and, when he falls into the ſcent, he muſt
be coaxed and encouraged; for all dogs have an
averſion from the wolf, and proceed with cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the chace. When the wolf is raiſed, the
grey-hounds are let looſe in pairs, and one is
kept for diſlodging him, if he gets under cover;
the other dogs are led before as a reſerve. The
firſt pair are let after the wolf, and are ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a man on horſe-back; then the ſecond
pair are let looſe at the diſtance of ſeven or eight
hundred paces; and, laſtly, the third pair, when
the other dogs begin to join and to teaze the wolf.
The whole together ſoon reduce him to the laſt
extremity; and the hunters complete the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
by ſtabbing him with a dagger. The dogs
have ſuch a reluctance to the wolf's fleſh, that
it muſt be prepared and ſeaſoned, before they will
eat it. The wolf may alſo be hunted with
beagles or hounds; but, as he darts always
ſtraight forward, and runs for a whole day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſlopping, the chace is irkſome, unleſs the
beagles be ſupported by grey-hounds, to teaze
him, and give the hounds time to come up.</p>
               <p>In the country, though men, attended with
maſtiffs, beat the buſhes, lay ſnares and baits, dig
pits, and ſcatter poiſoned pieces of meat; yet
the number of theſe deſtructive animals never
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0195500104:254"/>
decreaſes, eſpecially in woody countries. The
Britiſh pretend to have cleared their iſland of
this rapacious creature; and yet I am aſſured
that wolves ſtill exiſt in Scotland<note n="*" place="bottom">See ſupplement to this article.</note>. As there is
little wood in the ſouthern parts of Britain, it
was a more eaſy taſk to extirpate the wolf.</p>
               <p>The hair and colour of theſe animals vary
with the climate, and ſometimes even in the ſame
country. In France and Germany, beſide the
common wolves, we find ſome with thicker and
more yellow coloured hair. Theſe wolves, more
wild, though leſs deſtructive, than the other kind,
never trouble the flocks or the habitations of
men, and live ſolely on hunting. In the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
countries, we meet with ſome wolves which
are entirely white, and others entirely black;
and the latter are larger and ſtronger than the
former. The common ſpecies are very generally
diffuſed: They are found in Aſia<note n="†" place="bottom">See Le Voyage de Pietro della Valle, vol. 4. p. 4.</note>, Africa<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt. Gen. des Voyages, par M. l'Abbé Prevôt, tom. 5. p. 85.</note>, and
America<note n="§" place="bottom">Le Voyage du Leclercq. p. 488.</note>, as well as in Europe. The wolves
of Senegal<note n="‖" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. des Voyages, tom. 3. p. 285. Voage de le Maire aux iſles Canaries, Cap Verd, &amp;c. p. 100.</note> reſemble thoſe of France, only they
are larger and more rapacious. The wolves of
Egypt<note n="**" place="bottom">Ariſt. Hiſt. animal. lib. 8. cap. 28.</note> are ſmaller than thoſe of Greece. In
the Eaſt, and particularly in Perſia, wolves are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
as ſpectacles to the people. When young,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0195500104:255"/>
they are learned to dance, or rather to perform
a kind of wreſtling with a number of men.
Chardin tell us, that a wolf, well educated in
dancing, is ſold at 500 French crowns. This
fact proves, that theſe animals, by time and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
are ſuſceptible of ſome kind of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I have brought up ſeveral of them: When
young, or during their firſt year, they are very
docile, and even careſſing; and, if well fed, they
neither diſturb the poultry, nor any other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.
But, at the age of 18 months or two years,
their natural ferocity returns, and they muſt be
chained, to prevent them from running off, and
doing miſchief. I brought up one till the age
of 18 or 19 months, in a court along with fowls,
none of which he ever attacked; but, for his firſt
eſſay, he killed the whole in one night, without
eating any of them. Another, having broken
his chain, run off, after killing a dog with whom
he had lived in great familiarity. I kept a
ſhe-wolf three years in a large court; and,
though ſhut up, when very young, along with a
maſtiff dog of the ſame age, ſhe could never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to approach, even when ſhe came in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
She provoked, ſhe attacked, ſhe bit the
dog, who at firſt only defended himſelf, but at
laſt he worried her.</p>
               <p>There is nothing valuable in the wolf but his
ſkin, which makes a warm, durable fur. His
fleſh is ſo bad, that it is rejected with abhorrence
by all other quadrupeds; and no animal but a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0195500104:256"/>
wolf will voluntarily eat a wolf. The ſmell of
his breath is exceedingly offenſive. As, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
hunger, he ſwallows indiſcriminately every
thing he can find, corrupted fleſh, bones, hair,
ſkins half tanned and covered with lime, he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
frequently, and empties himſelf oftener
than he fills. In fine, the wolf is conſummate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſagreeable; his aſpect is baſe and ſavage,
his voice dreadful, his odour inſupportable, his
diſpoſition perverſe, his manners ferocious; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and deſtructive when living, and, when
dead, he is perfectly uſeleſs.</p>

                  <p>In the hiſtory of the wolf, I remarked, that
this animal was entirely extirpated in England.
By way of recompenſe, it would appear, that
theſe voracious creatures have found out new
countries to inhabit. Pontoppidan alledges, that
they exiſted not in Norway before the year 1718.
He ſays, that, during the laſt war between Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and Norway, the wolves paſſed the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
by following the proviſions of the army<note n="*" place="bottom">Pontoppidan's Nat. Hiſt. of Norway.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Some Engliſh authors, who treat of Britiſh
zoology, have reproached me for maintaining
that wolves ſtill exiſt in the northern parts of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0195500104:257"/>
their iſland. I never did affirm this as a fact,
but only ſaid<note n="*" place="bottom">See above, p. 207.</note>, that 'I was aſſured that wolves
ſtill exiſted in Scotland.' Lord Morton, then
Preſident of the Royal Society, a Scotſman
worthy of the greateſt credit and reſpect, and

aſſured me of this fact in the year 1756. To
his teſtimony I ſtill adhere, becauſe it is poſitive,
and becauſe the aſſertion of thoſe who deny the
fact, amount to a negative evidence only<note n="†" place="bottom">It is amuſing to ſee the Count de Buffon, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the repeated aſſurances he has had to the contrary, ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly maintaining, that there are wolves in the North of Scotland. He appeals to the evidence of the late Earl of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. We are fully diſpoſed to give due weight to an authority ſo reſpectable, and ſo worthy of credit. But we are convinced that the Count has miſapprehended his Lordſhip; for it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally known to the inhabitants of Scotland, that not a ſingle wolf has been ſeen in any part of that country for more than a century paſt.—Thus far the Tranſlator had written; but, when the ſheets were about going to the preſs, he received from a gentleman, not leſs remarkable for his learned and uſeful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions on various branches of Natural Hiſtory, than for invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable integrity, the following anecdote in writing, which throws a very different light upon this diſpute: 'I aſked,' ſays he, 'the late Lord Morton, If he ever told M. de Buffon, that wolves ſtill exiſted in Scotland? and Lord Morton declared, That he <hi>never did.</hi> M. de Buffon quoted to me, in 1765, in private converſation, that Lord Morton was his author, which made me put the queſtion to his Lordſhip.'</note>.</p>

               <head>The BLACK WOLF.</head>
               <p>I Deſcribe this animal only as a ſupplement to
the article <hi>Wolf</hi>; for both, I am perſuaded,
belong to the ſame ſpecies. In the hiſtory of
the wolf<note n="†" place="bottom">See above, p. 207.</note>, it was remarked, that, in the north
of Europe, there are ſome wolves which are
white, and others black, and that the black
kind are the largeſt. The wolf repreſented in
the Plate was brought from Canada. It was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
black, but ſmaller than our wolf: Its ears
were ſomewhat larger, more erect, and at a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
diſtance from each other. The eyes were
likewiſe a little ſmaller, and appeared to be more
diſtant from one another, than in the common
wolf. Theſe differences, in my opinion, are
too inconſiderable to conſtitute a diſtinct ſpecies.
The greateſt difference is that of the ſize. But,
as I have oftener than once remarked, all the
animals common to the northern parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
and America differ in ſize; and the black
wolf of Canada being ſmaller than thoſe of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
only tends to confirm the general fact.
Beſides, as he had been taken when very young,
and ever afterwards confined with a chain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
alone was perhaps ſufficient to prevent

               <p>THE fox is famous for craftineſs; and he
merits, in ſome meaſure, the reputation
he has acquired. What the wolf executes by
force alone, the fox performs by addreſs, and
often with more ſucceſs. Without combating
dogs or ſhepherds, without attacking the flocks,
or diſinterring the bodies of the dead, the fox
is more certain of procuring his food. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts
more genius than motion, and all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources
are within himſelf. Acute as well as
circumſpect, ingenious, and patiently prudent,
he diverſifies his conduct, and always reſerves
ſome art for unforeſeen accidents. Of his own
preſervation he is extremely vigilant. Though
equally indefatigable, and even nimbler than the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0195500104:264"/>
wolf, he truſts not entirely to the ſwiftneſs of
his courſe. The fox knows how to enſure ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by providing himſelf with an aſylum, where
he retires from preſſing dangers, where he dwells,
and where he brings up his young. He is not
a vagabond, but lives in a ſettled domeſtic ſtate.</p>
               <p>This difference, though it appears even among
men, has greater effects, and ſuppoſes more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
cauſes, among the inferior animals. The
ſingle idea of a houſe, or ſettled place of abode, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
a ſingular attention to ſelf. The choice
of ſituation, the art of making and rendering a
houſe commodious, and of concealing the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
to it, imply a ſuperior degree of ſentiment.
The fox is endowed with this quality, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
it with advantage. He fixes his abode on
the border of the wood, in the neighbourhood
of cottages: He liſtens to the crowing of the
cocks and the cries of the poultry. He ſcents
them at a diſtance; he chooſes his time with
judgment; he conceals his road as well as his
deſign; he ſlips forward with caution, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
even trailing his body, and ſeldom makes
a fruitleſs expedition. If he can leap the wall,
or get in underneath, he ravages the court-yard,
puts all to death, and then retires ſoftly with his
prey, which he either hides under the herbage,
or carries off to his kennel. He returns in a
few minutes for another, which he carries off,
or conceals in the ſame manner, but in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
place. In this way he proceeds till the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0195500104:265"/>
of the ſun, or ſome movements perceived
in the houſe, advertiſe him that it is time to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend
his operations, and to retire to his den.
He plays the ſame game with the catchers of
thruſhes, wood-cocks, &amp;c. He viſits the nets
and bird-lime, very early in the morning, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
off ſucceſſively the birds which are entangled,
and lays them in different places, eſpecially near
the ſides of high-ways, in the furrows, under
the herbage or bruſhwood, where they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
lie two or three days; but he knows per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
where to find them, when he is in need.
He hunts the young hares in the plains, ſeizes
old ones in their ſeats, never miſſes thoſe which
are wounded, digs out the rabbits in the warrens,
diſcovers the neſts of partridges and quails, ſeizes
the mothers on the eggs, and deſtroys a vaſt
quantity of game. The wolf is not more noxious
to the peaſant, than the fox to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>The chace of the fox requires leſs apparatus,
and is more amuſing, than that of the wolf. To
the latter every dog has great reluctance; but all
dogs hunt the fox ſpontaneouſly and with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
for, though his odour be ſtrong, they
often prefer him to the ſtag or the hare.
He may be hunted with terriers, hounds,
&amp;c. Whenever he finds himſelf purſued, he
runs to his hole; the terriers with crooked
legs, or turnſpits, go in with moſt eaſe. This
mode anſwers very well when we want to carry
off a whole litter of foxes, both mother and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0195500104:266"/>
young. While the mother defends herſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the terriers, the hunters remove the earth
above, and either kill or ſeize her alive. But,
as the holes are often under rocks, the roots
of trees, or ſunk too deep in the ground, this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
is frequently unſucceſsful. The moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and moſt common method of hunting foxes,
is to begin with ſhutting up their hole, to place
a man with a gun near the entrance, and then to
ſearch about with the dogs. When they fall in
with him, he immediately makes for his hole;
but, when he comes up to it, he is met with a
diſcharge from the gun. If he eſcapes the ſhot,
he flies with full ſpeed, takes a large circuit, and
returns again to the hole, where he is fired up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſecond time; but, finding the entrance
ſhut, he now endeavours to eſcape by darting
ſtraight forward, with the deſign of never revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
his former habitation. He is then purſued
by the hounds, whom he ſeldom fails to fatigue,
becauſe he purpoſely paſſes through the thickeſt
parts of the foreſt or places of the moſt difficult
acceſs, where the dogs are hardly able to follow
him; and, when he takes to the plains, he runs
ſtraight out, without ſtopping or doubling.</p>
               <p>But the moſt effectual mode of deſtroying fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
is the laying of ſnares baited with a pigeon,
a live fowl, &amp;c. I once ſuſpended on a tree, at
the height of nine feet, ſome meat, bread, and
bones. The foxes had been at ſevere exerciſe
during the night; for, next morning, the earth
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0195500104:267"/>
all around was beaten, by their jumping, as
ſmooth as a barn-floor. The fox is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
voracious; beſide fleſh of all kinds, he eats,
with equal avidity, eggs, milk, cheeſe, fruits,
and particularly grapes. When the young hares
and partridges fail him, he makes war againſt
rats, field-mice, ſerpents, lizards, tods, &amp;c. Of
theſe he deſtroys vaſt numbers; and this is the
only ſervice he does to mankind. He is ſo fond
of honey, that he attacks the wild bees, waſps,
and hornets. They at firſt put him to flight by
a thouſand ſtings; but he retires only for the
purpoſe of rolling himſelf on the ground to cruſh
them; and he returns ſo often to the charge,
that he obliges them to abandon the hive, which
he ſoon uncovers, and devours both the honey
and wax. In a word, he eats fiſhes, lobſters,
graſs-hoppers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fox has a great reſemblance to the dog,
eſpecially in his internal parts. His head, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
is larger in proportion to his body; his
ears are alſo ſhorter, his tail thicker, his hair
longer and more buſhy, and his eyes more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.
He differs ſtill more from the dog by a
ſtrong offenſive odour which is peculiar to him,
and by his natural diſpoſition; for he is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily,
and never fully tamed: He languiſhes when
deprived of liberty, and, if kept too long in a
domeſtic ſtate, he dies of chagrin. He does not
copulate with the female dog<note n="*" place="bottom">See my experiments on this ſubject, article Dog.</note>: If they have
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0195500104:268"/>
no rooted antipathy, they are at leaſt indifferent
to each other. Foxes produce but once a year;
and the litter commonly conſiſts of four or five,
ſeldom ſix, and never leſs than three. When
the female is full, ſhe retires, and ſeldom goes
out of her hole, where ſhe prepares a bed for her
young. She comes in ſeaſon in the winter;
and young foxes are found in the month of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril.
When ſhe perceives that her retreat is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and that her young have been diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſhe carries them off one by one, and goes in
ſearch of another habitation. The young are
brought forth blind; like the dogs, they grow
18 months, or two years, and live 13 or 14
years.</p>
               <p>The ſenſes of the fox are equally good as
thoſe of the wolf; his ſentiment is more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate;
and the organs of his voice are more pliant
and perfect. The wolf ſends forth only fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
howlings; but the fox barks, yelps, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
a mournful cry like that of the peacock.
He varies his tones according to the different ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
with which he is affected: He has an
accent peculiar to the chace, the tone of deſire,
of complaint, and of ſorrow. He has another
cry expreſſive of acute pain, which he utters
only when he is ſhot, or has ſome of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
broken; for he never complains of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wound, and, like the wolf, allows himſelf
to be killed with a bludgeon without complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but he always defends himſelf to the laſt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0195500104:269"/>
with great courage and bravery. His bite is
obſtinate and dangerous; and the ſevereſt blows
will hardly make him quit his hold. His yelp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is a ſpecies of barking, and conſiſts of a quick
ſucceſſion of ſimilar tones; at the end of which
he generally raiſes his voice ſimilar to the cry of
the peacock. In winter, and particularly during
froſt and ſnow, he yelps perpetually; but, in
ſummer, he is almoſt entirely ſilent, and, during
this ſeaſon, he caſts his hair. The ſkins of young
foxes, and of thoſe taken in ſummer, are of little
value. The fleſh of the fox is not ſo bad as that
of the wolf: Dogs, and even men, eat it in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn,
eſpecially when he has been fattened with
grapes; and his ſkin in winter makes excellent
furs. He ſleeps ſound, and may be eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
without wakening: He ſleeps in a
round form, like the dog; but, when he only
repoſes himſelf, he extends his hind legs, and lies
on his belly. It is in this ſituation that he ſpies
the birds along the hedges, who have ſuch an
antipathy to him, that they no ſooner perceive
him, than they ſend forth ſoft ſhrill cries to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
their neighbours of the enemy's approach.
The jays and black birds, particularly, follow the
fox from tree to tree, ſometimes two or three
hundred paces, often repeating the watch-cries.</p>
               <p>I brought up ſome young foxes: Their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
odour made it neceſſary to keep them in
ſtables or places which were not much frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This, perhaps, might be one reaſon why
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0195500104:270"/>
they were leſs tame than the wolf, which was
kept nearer the houſe. At the age of five or ſix
months, the young foxes purſued the ducks and
fowls; and, therefore, it became neceſſary to
chain them. I kept two males and a female two
years. I tried in vain to make the males copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
with bitches: Though they had never ſeen
females of their own ſpecies, and were ſtimulated
by the ſtrongeſt deſires of nature, they uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejected the bitches. But, whenever a ſhe-fox
was preſented to them, though chained, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
covered her, and ſhe brought forth four
whelps. The young foxes, who, when at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
had darted on the poultry, never attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to touch a ſingle fowl, after they were chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
A living hen was generally fixed near them
for a whole night; and, though victuals were
kept from them for many hours; yet, in ſpite of
hunger and of opportunity, they never forgot
that they were chained, and diſturbed not the
hen.</p>
               <p>The fox is ſo extremely ſubject to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of climate, that the varieties of this ſpecies
are almoſt as numerous as thoſe of the domeſtic
animals. Moſt of our foxes are reddiſh; but
ſome of them are found of a ſilver gray: In
both, the end of the tail is white. In Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the latter are called <hi>coal foxes</hi>; becauſe their
feet are remarkably black. Their bodies have
alſo the appearance of being ſhorter, becauſe
they are better clad with hair. There are ſome
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0195500104:271"/>
who are really longer than the other kinds, and
of a dirty gray colour, nearly the ſame with that
of old wolves. But it is uncertain whether this
difference conſtitutes a real variety, or is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the age of the animal, who, perhaps,
grows whiter as he advances in years. In the
northern regions, the foxes are of all colours,
black, blue, gray, iron-coloured, ſilver gray,
white, white with yellow feet, white with black
heads, white with the extremity of the tail black,
reddiſh with the throat and belly entirely white;
and, laſtly, ſome of them have a black line along
the ſpine, croſſed with another black line over
the ſhoulder. The latter are larger than the
other kinds, and have black throats. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſpecies are more generally diffuſed than any
of the others. We find them in every part of
Europe<note n="*" place="bottom">See les Oeuvres de Renard, tom. 1. p. 175.</note>, in the northern and temperate regions
of Aſia<note n="†" place="bottom">Voyage d'Olearius, tom. 1. p. 368.</note>, and in America<note n="‡" place="bottom">Voyage de la Hontan, tom. 2. p. 42.</note>; but they are very
rare in Africa, and in the countries bordering on
the Equator. Travellers who pretend to have
ſeen them in Calicut<note n="‖" place="bottom">Voyage de Pyrard, tom. 1. p. 427.</note>, and other ſouthern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of India, have miſtaken the jackal for the
fox. Ariſtotle himſelf falls into a ſimilar error,
when he tells us<note n="§" place="bottom">Ariſt. Hiſt. animal. lib. 8. cap. 18.</note>, that the foxes of Egypt are
ſmaller than thoſe of Greece; for what he calls
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0195500104:272"/>
the ſmall foxes of Egypt are polecats<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovand. Quadrup. Hiſt. p. 197.</note>, whoſe
odour is intollerable. Our foxes, who belong o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
to cold climates, have ſpread over all
the temperate regions, but have never penetrated
farther ſouth than Spain and Japan<note n="†" place="bottom">L'hiſt. du Japan, par Koempfer, tom. 1. p. 110.</note>. What
demonſtrates them to be natives of cold coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
is, that all the varieties of the ſpecies are to
be found in the high latitudes, and no where
elſe: Beſides, they ſupport with eaſe the moſt
extreme cold, and live in the neighbourhood of
both poles<note n="‡" place="bottom">Narborough's voyage to the South Seas; Coreal, tom. 2. p. 184.; Recueil des voyages du Nord, tom. 2. p. 113.; Recueil des voyages qui ont ſervi à l'etabliſſement de la Comp. des Indes Orient. tom. 1. p. 39.</note>. The fur of the white foxes is not
much valued, becauſe the hairs fall eaſily off;
the ſilver gray is better; and the blue and croſs
kinds are in great requeſt, on account of their
rarity; but the black is the moſt precious; next
to that of the ſable, it is the beſt and deareſt fur.

often indulges in the marvellous, tells us, that a
fox had ranked ſeveral heads of fiſhes into rows,
at ſome diſtance from a fiſher's hut; that the
people could not imagine what might be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,

lighted to feed upon the heads, fell a ſacrifice to
his cunning device. He adds, that theſe animals

               <p>THE Badger is an indolent, diffident, ſolitary
animal. He retires to the moſt ſecret places,
to the inmoſt receſſes of the foreſt, and there digs
a ſubterranean habitation. He ſeems to fly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and even the light, and ſpends three
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0195500104:277"/>
fourths of life in his dark abode, from which he
never departs but in queſt of ſubſiſtence. As his
body is long, his legs ſhort, his claws, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe of the fore-feet, very long and ſtrong,
he digs and penetrates the earth with greater
facility than any other animal. He makes his
hole winding and oblique. The fox, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
dig with equal dexterity, avails himſelf of the
operations of the badger: Being unable to make
him quit his habitation by force, the fox prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes
every art to render him uneaſy: He ſtands
ſentinel at the entrance of the hole, and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files
it with his ordure. He afterwards takes
poſſeſſion, enlarges, and fits it up for his own
accommodation. The badger, though obliged
to change his habitation, leaves not his country.
He goes only to a ſmall diſtance, where he digs
a freſh hole, from which he never removes but
in the night; and, as he never goes far, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
upon the approach of danger. This is his
only mean of ſafety; for he cannot eſcape by
flight: His legs are too ſhort for quick motion.
When at ſome diſtance from his hole, he is ſoon
overtaken by the dogs. They ſeldom, however,
accompliſh their purpoſe without aſſiſtance. The
hair of the badger is very thick, and his legs,
jaws, teeth, and claws, are exceedingly ſtrong.
Theſe natural weapons he uſes with courage and
dexterity: He lies on his back, reſiſts all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the dogs, and wounds them in the moſt
dangerous manner. He is, beſides, very tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0195500104:278"/>
of life, fights long, makes a brave defence,
and perſiſts to the very laſt extremity.</p>
               <p>Formerly, when badgers were more common,
terriers were trained to hunt and to take them
in their holes. The badger defends himſelf by
retiring and throwing back the earth, in order
to ſtop or bury the dogs. He can only be taken
by opening the hole above, after the dogs have
puſhed him to the end of it. The people lay
hold of him with pincers, and then muzzle him,
to prevent his biting. I have kept ſome of them,
which had been taken in this manner, a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time. The young ones are eaſily tamed;
they play with the dogs, and follow the perſon
who feeds them. But, when taken old, they
continue always ſavage. They are neither miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
nor ravenous, like the wolf and fox;
and yet they are carnivorous. They eat every
thing preſented to them, as fleſh, eggs, cheeſe,
butter, bread, fiſh, fruit, nuts, grain, roots, &amp;c.
But raw fleſh they prefer to every other food.
They ſleep the whole night and three fourths of
the day; and yet they are ſubject to a lethargic
or benummed ſtate during winter, like the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mottes
or dormice. This great quantity of ſleep
makes them fat, though they eat but little; and,
for the ſame reaſon, they can ſupport hunger
with eaſe, and often remain in their holes three
or four days together, eſpecially during ſnow.</p>
               <p>They keep their habitations extremely clean,
and never defile them with their ordure. The
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0195500104:279"/>
male is ſeldom found with the female. When
about to bring forth, ſhe cuts down the herbage,
bundles it up, and trails it with her feet to the
bottom of the hole, where ſhe makes a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
bed for herſelf and her young. She brings
forth in ſummer; and the litter commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of three or four. When ſomewhat advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
ſhe brings them victuals. She now travels
in the night to greater diſtances than formerly.
She uncovers the earth from bee-hives, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
off the honey; ſhe ruſhes into the burrows
of rabbits, and ſeizes their young; ſhe likewiſe
lays hold of field-mice, lizards, ſerpents, graſſ-hoppers,
and birds eggs, which ſhe conveys to her
offspring, whom ſhe often leads to the mouth
of the hole, in order to ſuckle or to feed them.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals are naturally chilly: Thoſe
brought up in the houſe would never quit the
corner of the fire, and often approach ſo near as
to burn their feet, which do not readily heal.
They are ſubject to the itch, and often infect the
dogs which enter their holes, unleſs they be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
carefully waſhed. The hair of the badger
is always rude and greaſy. Between the anus
and tail, there is a pretty large fiſſure, penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
only about an inch deep, from which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
exudes an unctuous ill ſcented liquor,
which the animal is found of ſucking. The fleſh
of the badger has not a very bad taſte; and
coarſe furs, collars for dogs, coverings for horſes,
&amp;c. are made of his ſkin.</p>

We know of no varieties in this ſpecies: We
have endeavoured, without ſucceſs, to find the
ſow-badger ſpoken of by hunters. Dufouilloux<note n="*" place="bottom">La Venerie de Dufouilloux, p. 72.</note>
tells us, that there are two ſpecies of badgers, the
ſow and the dog-badger; and that the ſow-badger
is fatter, whiter, and groſſer, both in the
body and head, than the dog-badger. Theſe
differences are extremely trivial; and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges,
that they are not to be perceived
without an accurate inſpection<note n="†" place="bottom">Id. ibid.</note>. This diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I conſider as a vulgar error, probably found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the double name of this animal, both in
Latin, viz. <hi>meles</hi> and <hi>taxus,</hi> and in French, viz.
<hi>blaireau</hi> and <hi>taiſſon.</hi> Beſides, thoſe ſpecies which

generally diffuſed: That of the badger, on the

doubtful whether the <hi>Foſſa</hi> of Madagaſcar, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

animal. It is never taken notice of by other
travellers: Dr Shaw even ſays that the badger
is totally unknown in Barbary<note n="†" place="bottom">Shaw's travels.</note> It ſeems like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
not to exiſt in Aſia: It was not known to
the Greeks; for Ariſtotle never mentions it, and
the badger has no name in the Greek language.
Hence this ſpecies of quadruped, an original
native of the temperate climates of Europe, has
never ſpread beyond Spain, France, Italy, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
Britain, Poland, and Sweden; and it is
every where very ſcarce. The badger admits
not only of no varieties, but he even approaches
not to any other ſpecies. His characters are
deeply marked, and very ſingular. The alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
belts upon his head, and the fiſſure under
his tail, are perfectly peculiar; and his body is
nearly white above, and almoſt black below,
which is contrary to all other animals, whoſe
bellies are always of a lighter colour than their

               <p>THE Otter is a voracious animal, but fonder
of fiſh than of fleſh: He never quits the
margins of rivers or of lakes, and often depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
the fiſh-ponds. He ſwims with more eaſe
than the beaver; for the latter has membranes
on his hind-feet only, and the toes of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet
are ſeparate; but the otter has membranes
on all his feet. He ſwims almoſt as quick as he
walks. He never goes to the ſea like the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
but traverſes the freſh waters and rivers
to very conſiderable diſtances. He often ſwims
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0195500104:284"/>
under the water, and, after remaining pretty
long, aſcends to the ſurface for air. Properly
ſpeaking, he is not an amphibious animal, or an
animal that can live equally in air or in water.
He is not formed for continuing in the latter ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for, like other terreſtrial creatures, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the aid of reſpiration. When in purſuit
of a fiſh, if he chances to be entangled in a net,
he drowns; and we perceive that he has not had
time to cut a ſufficient quantity of the meſhes to
effectuate his eſcape. His teeth reſemble thoſe
of the martin; but they are proportionally long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and ſtronger. For want of fiſhes, crabs, frogs,
water-rats, or other food, he gnaws the young
twigs, and eats the bark of aquatic trees; he
likewiſe eats the young herbage in the ſpring.
He is neither afraid of cold nor of moiſture.
The female comes in ſeaſon in winter, brings
forth in March, and the litter conſiſts of three or
four. Young animals are generally beautiful;
but the young otter is not ſo handſome as the
old. A head ill-ſhaped, ears placed low, eyes
ſmall and covered, a lurid aſpect, aukward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
an ignoble and deformed figure, and a kind
of mechanical cry which he repeats every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſeem to indicate a ſtupid animal. The ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
however, acquires induſtry with age, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
at leaſt, to carry on a ſucceſsful war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the fiſhes, who, both with regard to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
and inſtinct, are much inferior to other
animals. But I can hardly allow him to have
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0195500104:285"/>
the talents of the beaver, or even the habits aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to him, ſuch as that of always aſcending the
rivers, in order to ſwim the more eaſily down
the current, when loaded with his prey<note n="*" place="bottom">See Geſner. hiſt. quad. p. 685.</note> that
of fitting up and flooring his houſe to exclude
the water; that of hoarding a ſtore of fiſhes, in
caſe of a ſcarcity; and, laſtly, that of being ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
tamed, of fiſhing for his maſter, and even
bringing the fiſh into the kitchen. All I know
is, that the otters dig no habitations for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
that they take poſſeſſion of the firſt hole
they find, under the roots of poplars or willows,
in the cliffs of rocks, and even in piles of float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wood; that they depoſit their young on beds
made of twigs and herbs; that we find in their
habitations, heads and bones of fiſhes; that they
often change their places of abode; that they
baniſh their young at the end of ſix weeks or two
months; that thoſe I attempted to tame, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to bite, though they were only taking
milk, and unable to eat fiſh; that ſome days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they became more gentle, perhaps becauſe
they were weak or ſick; that, ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eaſily accuſtomed to a domeſtic life, all of
them which I attempted to bring up, died young;
that the otter is naturally of a ſavage and cruel
diſpoſition; that, when he gets into a fiſh pond,
he is equally deſtructive as the polecat in a hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe;
that he kills many more fiſhes than he
can eat, and then carries off one in his mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0195500104:286"/>
Though the otter does not caſt his hair, his
ſkin is browner, and ſells dearer in winter than
in ſummer; it makes a very fine fur. His fleſh
has a diſagreeable fiſhy taſte. His retreats ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale
a noxious odour, from the remains of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
fiſhes; and his own body has a bad ſmell.
The dogs chace the otter ſpontaneouſly, and eaſily
apprehend him when at a diſtance from water
or from his hole. But, when ſeized, he defends
himſelf, bites the dogs moſt cruelly, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with ſuch force as to break their leg-bones,
and never quits his hold till death looſes his
jaws. The beaver, however, who is not a very
ſtrong animal, purſues the otters, and permits
them not to live upon the banks poſſeſſed by the
latter.</p>
               <p>This ſpecies, though not very numerous, is
ſpread over Europe from Sweden to Naples; and
we find them even in North America<note n="*" place="bottom">See le voyage de la Hontan, tom. 2. p. 38.</note>. They
were well known to the Greeks<note n="†" place="bottom">See Ariſt. Hiſt. animal. lib. 8. cap. 5.</note>, and probably
extend over all the temperate climates, eſpecially
in places which abound with water; for the otter
can neither dwell in burning ſands, nor in dry
deſerts. He equally flies barren rivers, and thoſe
that are too much frequented. I believe none
of them are to be found in very warm countries;

                  <p>Pontoppidan aſſures us, that, in Norway, the

which was fed with milk, brought fiſh daily to

                  <p>In ſome notes communicated by M. de la
Borde, I find that there are three ſpecies of ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in Cayenne; the black, which weighs 40 or
50 pounds; the yellowiſh, which weighs 20 or
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0195500104:288"/>
25 pounds; and the ſmall grayiſh kind, which
weighs not above three or four pounds. He
farther remarks, that theſe animals are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in Guiana, along the rivers and marſhes
where fiſhes abound: They ſometimes appear in
numerous troops, and are ſo fierce that they
cannot be approached. Their bite is cruel, and
they defend themſelves againſt the dogs. They
litter in holes which they dig in the banks.
They are often tamed and brought up in houſes.
I have remarked, ſays M. de la Borde, that all
the animals of Guiana are eaſily accuſtomed to
a domeſtic ſtate, and become even troubleſome
by their familiarity.</p>
                  <p>M. Aublet, a learned botaniſt formerly quoted,
and M. Olivier, ſurgeon to the King, who have
long reſided in Cayenne, affirm, that there are
otters in that country ſo large, that they weigh
90 and 100 pounds. They live in the great and
unfrequented rivers, and their heads often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
above the water. Their cry is heard at
great diſtances; their hair is very ſoft, but ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than that of the beaver, and generally of a
dark brown colour. They live upon fiſh, and
eat likewiſe the grains which fall into the water
from the banks of the rivers.</p>
                  <p>I have added the figure of a ſmall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſent me from Guiana, under the name of
<hi>the ſmall freſh-water otter of Cayenne,</hi> which
appears to be the third ſpecies mentioned by M.
la Borde. It is only ſeven inches long, from
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0195500104:289"/>
the end of the noſe to the extremity of the body.
The tail of this ſmall otter, like that of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-rat,
has no hair; its length is ſix inches ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
lines, and five lines thick at the origin, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
gradually to the extremity, which is
white, though the reſt of the tail is brown; and,
in place of hair, it is covered with a rough gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulated

convex above. The whiſkers, and the long
hairs under the eye, are about an inch in length.
All the under part of the body and head, as well
as the fore-part of the fore-legs, is white. The
top and ſides of the head and body are marked
with large browniſh black ſpots, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
are of a yellowiſh gray colour. The black
ſpots correſpond on each ſide of the body. There
is a white ſpot above the eye. The ears are
large, and ſeem to be longer than thoſe of the
common otter. The legs are ſhort; the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet
have five unconnected toes; there are the
ſame number in the hind-feet, but they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with membranes.</p>

               <p>MOST naturaliſts have deſcribed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
and the pine-weaſel, or yellow-breaſted
martin, as animals of the ſame ſpecies.
Geſner<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner, Hiſt. quad. p. 76. Ray, ſynopſ. quad. p. 200.</note> and Ray, in imitation of Albertus,
affirm, that they intermix promiſcuouſly. This
fact, however, which is ſupported by no other
evidence, appears, at leaſt, to be doubtful: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
on the contrary, that theſe animals have
no intercourſe, but form two diſtinct and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0195500104:293"/>
pendent ſpecies. To illuſtrate this point, I ſhall
give a few reaſons. If the pine-weaſel were
only a wild martin, or the martin a domeſtic
pine-weaſel, the firſt would conſtantly preſerve
the ſame characters, and the latter would be
ſubject to variations; as the wild cat uniformly
remains the ſame, while the domeſtic cat aſſumes
all ſorts of colours. The martin, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
never varies, but preſerves its peculiar cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
as conſtantly as the pine-weaſel retains
thoſe which are proper to it. This alone is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
proof, that thoſe two animals are ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
different, and that the one is not a ſimple
variety of the other. Beſides, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for regarding the martin as a domeſtic ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal:
He is no more domeſtic than the fox or the
polecats, who, like him, approach the habitations
of men in queſt of their prey; and he has no
greater communication with mankind than the
other animals we call wild or ſavage. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
therefore, differs from the pine-weaſel both
in diſpoſition and temperament; for the latter flies
the open fields, lives in the moſt ſecret receſſes
of the foreſt, and is never found, in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
in cold climates: But the martin approaches
our habitations, takes up his abode in old build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
in hay-lofts, and in holes of the walls.
The ſpecies is likewiſe ſpread in great numbers
over all the temperate countries, and is even
found in warm regions, as in Madagaſcar<note n="*" place="bottom">See Voyages de Struys, tom. 1. p. 30.</note>, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0195500104:294"/>
the Maldiva iſlands<note n="†" place="bottom">Voyage de Pyrard, tom. 1. p. 132.</note>, and is never ſeen in high
latitudes.</p>
               <p>The martin has a fine countenance, a lively
eye, ſupple limbs, and a flexible body. His
movements are all exceedingly nimble; he rather
bounds and leaps, than walks. He climbs rough
walls with eaſe and alacrity; enters the pigeon
or hen-houſes, eats the eggs, pigeons, fowls, &amp;c.
and the female often kills great numbers, and
tranſports them to her young. He likewiſe
ſeizes mice, rats, moles, and birds in their neſt.
I kept one of theſe animals a conſiderable time.
He tamed to a certain degree; but never form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any attachment, and continued always ſo wild
that it was neceſſary to chain him. He made
war againſt the rats, and attacked the poultry,
whenever they came in his way. He often got
looſe, though chained by the middle of the body.
At firſt, he went to no great diſtance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
in a few hours, but without diſcovering
any ſymptoms of joy or of affection to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſon. He, however, called for victuals,
like a cat or a dog. Afterwards he made longer
excurſions, and, at laſt, he thought proper ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to return. He was then about a year and a
half old, ſeemingly the age at which nature aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
her full aſcendency. He eat every thing
preſented to him, except ſalad and herbs. He
was fond of honey, and preferred hemp-ſeed
to every other grain. We remarked, that he
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0195500104:295"/>
drank very often; that he ſometimes ſlept two
days ſucceſſively; that, at other times, he would
ſleep none for two or three days; that, before
ſleeping, he folded himſelf in a round form, and
covered his head with his tail; and that, while
awake, his motions were ſo violent, ſo perpetual,
and ſo incommodious, that, though he had not
diſturbed the fowls, we found it neceſſary to
chain him, to prevent him from breaking every
thing. We have had in our poſſeſſion ſeveral other
martins of a more advanced age, which had been
taken in nets; but they continued to be totally
ſavage, bit all who attempted to touch them, and
would eat nothing but raw fleſh.</p>
               <p>Martins, it is ſaid, go with young as long as
cats. We meet with young ones from ſpring
to autumn; and, therefore, it is probable that they
bring forth more than once a year. The younger
females litter only three or four at a time; but
the more aged produce ſix or ſeven. When a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to bring forth, they take up their abode in
magazines of hay, in holes of walls, which
they ſtuff with ſtraw and herbs, in clefts of rocks,
or in the hollow trunks of trees; and, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed,
they remove their young, who ſeem to
grow very ſoon to maturity; for the one I kept
had nearly attained its full growth in one year;
Hence we may conclude, that thoſe animals live
only eight or ten years. They have a kind of
muſky ſmell, which is not very diſagreeable.
The pine-weaſel and the martin, like ſome other
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0195500104:296"/>
animals, have two veſicles, one on each ſide of
the extremity of the rectum, which contain an
odoriferous matter, ſimilar to that procured from
the civet cat. Their fleſh retains a little of this
odour; and yet that of the pine-weaſel is not
bad. The fleſh of the martin is more diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and his ſkin is likewiſe much leſs valuable.</p>

                  <p>I have added the figure of an American ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
which was ſent from Guiana to M. Aubry,
curate of St Louis. Though this animal wants
the teeth, it is ſo ſimilar in all the other parts of
the body to the common martin, that it may be
regarded as a variety of that ſpecies. It differs
from the martin only in having the colour of the
hair ſprinkled with black and white, a ſhorter
tail, and ſpots on the head. The martin of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana
is three or four inches longer than the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean;
but the tail is proportionally ſhorter.
The muzzle ſeems alſo to be longer; it is black,
and the blackneſs extends above the eyes, paſſes
under the ears along the neck, and loſes itſelf in
the brown hair of the ſhoulders. There is a large
white ſpace above the eyes, which ſpreads upon
the front, ſurrounds the ears, forms a narrow
band along the neck, and diſappears on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
The ears are perfectly ſimilar to thoſe of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0195500104:297"/>
the martin. The top of the head is gray, mixed
with white; the neck is brown, interſperſed with
aſh-coloured hairs; and the body is covered
with a mixture of white and blackiſh hairs.
Theſe hairs are gray and aſh-coloured at their
origin, then brown, and black and white at the
extremities. The under part of thejaw is of a
blackiſh brown colour, which extends under the
neck, and vaniſhes towards the belly, which is of
a bright brown or cheſnut. The legs and feet are
covered with ſhining reddiſh black hair; and the
toes have a greater reſemblance to the toes of
the ſquirrel and rat than to thoſe of the martin.
The great toes of the fore-feet are four lines
long; but thoſe of the hind-feet only two. The
tail is more buſhy at the origin than the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and the hair of it is cheſnut or a bright
brown mixed with black.</p>
                  <p>We have given the figure of another Cayenne
animal, which ſeems to have a great analogy to
the former. It was drawn from the life at the
fair of St Germain, in 1768, and meaſured 15
inches from the tip of the noſe to the origin of
the tail, which was eight inches, and more buſhy
at the root than at the extremity. This animal
is ſhort legged, like our martins: The form of
the head approaches nearly to that of the martin;
but in the ears there is no reſemblance. The body
is covered with woolly hair: There are five toes
on each foot, armed with ſmall claws like thoſe
of the martin.</p>

               <p>THIS animal is a native of northern
regions, where the ſpecies is ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
that the quantity of their furs annually
conſumed is perfectly aſtoniſhing. There are
very few of them in the temperate climates, and
they exiſt not in very warm countries. Some
of them are found in the foreſts of Burgundy,
and likewiſe in thoſe of Fountainbleau; but, in
general, they are as rare in France as the martin
is frequent. There are none of thoſe animals in
Britain; becauſe they have no extenſive foreſts
in that country. They fly equally inhabited
countries and uncovered fields. They dwell in
the woods, and conceal not themſelves among
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0195500104:302"/>
the rocks, but traverſe the foreſt and climb the
trees. They live by hunting, and deſtroy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
quantities of birds, by eating their eggs.
They ſeize ſquirrels, field-mice, &amp;c. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
eat honey, like the martin and polecat. They
never appear in the open fields, in the meadows,
or in the vineyards. They approach not the
dwellings of men; and they differ ſtill farther
from the martin in their manner of making their
eſcape from the hunters. When the martin is
purſued by a dog, he inſtantly runs to his hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft
or his hole. The pine-weaſel, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
runs a long time before the dogs, then
climbs the trunk of a tree, and, from this ſtation,
he views them as they paſs. The track which he
leaves in the ſnow appears to be that of a large
animal, becauſe he always leaps, and both feet
make but one mark. He is ſomewhat larger
than the martin, and yet his head is ſhorter. His
legs are longer, and conſequently he runs more
eaſily. His neck is yellow; but that of the
martin is white. His hair is finer, more buſhy,
and leſs ſubject to fall off. The female pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
not a bed for her young; and yet lodges
them moſt commodiouſly. The ſquirrels build
neſts in the tops of trees, with equal art as the
birds. When the pine-weaſel is about to bring
forth, ſhe climbs to the ſquirrel's neſt, baniſhes
the poſſeſſor, enlarges the entry to it, and there
depoſits her young. She likewiſe uſes the old
neſts of ducks or buzzards, and holes of antient
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0195500104:303"/>
trees, from which ſhe diſlodges the wood-peckers
and others birds. She brings forth in the ſpring,
and her litter conſiſts only of two or three.
Though her young come into the world blind,
they ſoon acquire a conſiderable growth. She
brings to them eggs and birds; and afterwards
leads them out to hunt along with herſelf. The
birds are ſo well acquainted with their enemies,
that, when they perceive the pine-weaſel, they
utter the ſame mournful cry to advertiſe his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
as when they ſee a fox. What ſhows
that the birds are animated with hatred, rather
than fear, is, that they follow at a diſtance, and
utter this peculiar cry againſt all carnivorous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
as the wolf, the fox, the pine-weaſel,
the wild cat, &amp;c. but never againſt the ſtag,
the roe, the hare, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The pine-weaſels are very frequent in the
northern parts of America, Europe, and Aſia.
Many of them are brought from Canada, and
they extend as far as Hudſon's bay<note n="*" place="bottom">Lade's Voyages, vol. 2. p. 227.</note>; and, in
Aſia, as far north as the kingdom of Tonquin<note n="†" place="bottom">Tavernier, tom. 4. p. 182. Hiſt. gen. des voyages, tom. 7. p. 117.</note>
and the empire of China<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt. gen. des voyages, tom. 6. p. 562.</note>. They ought not to
be confounded with the ſable, an animal whoſe
fur is much more precious. The ſable is black;
but the pine-weaſel is brown and yellow. The
moſt valuable part of the ſkin of the latter is
the brown, which extends along the whole back
to the extremity of the tail.</p>

               <p>THE polecat has a great reſemblance to the
martin in temperament, diſpoſition, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and figure. Like the latter, he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
our habitations, mounts on the roofs, takes
up his abode in hay-lofts, barns, and unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
places, from which he iſſues during the night
only, in queſt of prey. He ſteals ſlily into the
court-yards, voleries, and pigeon-houſes, where,
with leſs noiſe than the martin, he makes great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
havock, cutting off the heads of all the fowls,
and then tranſporting them one by one to his
magazine. If, as frequently happens, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
carry them off entire, on account of the
ſmallneſs of the entry to his hole, he eats the

brains, and takes only their heads along with
him. He is likewiſe very fond of honey, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks
the hives in winter, and forces the bees to
abandon them. He never retires far from the
abodes of men. The ſpring is their ſeaſon of
love: The males fight for the female on the
roofs of houſes. They afterwards leave her, and
go to paſs the ſummer in the fields or in the
woods. The female, on the contrary, continues
in her habitation till ſhe brings forth, and leads
not off her young till toward the end of ſummer.
She litters three or four, and ſometimes five,
ſuckles them but a ſhort time, and early accuſtoms
them to eat blood and eggs.</p>
               <p>In the villages, they live upon poultry; and,
in the country, they hunt for prey. During the
ſummer, they take up their abode in rabbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes,
in the cliffs of rocks, or in the hollow
trunks of trees, from which they iſſue out in the
night, and roam about the fields and woods,
ſearching for the neſts of partridges, larks, and
quails. They climb trees in queſt of the neſts
of other birds. They lie in watch for rats,
field-mice, and moles; and carry on a perpetual
war againſt the rabbits, who cannot eſcape them,
as they enter with eaſe into their holes. A
ſingle family of polecats is ſufficient to deſtroy
a whole warren. This would be a ſimple me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of diminiſhing the number of rabbits in
places where they are too abundant.</p>

The polecat is ſomewhat leſs than the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin:
His tail is alſo ſhorter, his muzzle ſharper,
and his hair blacker and more buſhy: He has
white hair on his front, and likewiſe on the ſides
of the noſe and round the mouth. He differs
ſtill more from the martin in his voice; the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
has a ſharp piercing cry; the cry of the pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
is blunter. Each of them, as well as the
pine-weaſel and ſquirrel, have a deep grunting
tone, which they often repeat when irritated.
Laſtly, the odour of the martin is very different
from that of the polecat, which, inſtead of being

circumſtance, the animal obtained its Latin name
<hi>putorius.</hi> He ſends forth this inſupportable
odour to a great diſtance, eſpecially when irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.
The dogs will not eat the fleſh of the
polecat; and even his ſkin, though good, is in
no eſtimation, becauſe it never loſes entirely its
natural ſmell. This odour proceeds from two
veſicles near the anus, from which an unctuous
matter continually exudes; and the effluvia of
it is extremely offenſive in the polecat, ferret,
weaſel, badger, &amp;c.; but it conſtitutes, on the
contrary, a ſpecies of perfume, in the civet-cat,
pine-weaſel, martin, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The polecat ſeems to be confined to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
climates: Few or none of them are found
in the northern regions; and, in warm countries,
they are ſtill more rare than the pine-weaſel.

appears to be bounded, in Europe, from Italy to
Poland. This animal, it is certain, avoids the
cold; for, in winter, he retires into the houſes,
and his ſteps are never ſeen in the ſnow, either
in the woods or in fields which are diſtant from
the habitations of men: He, perhaps, is equally

               <p>WHETHER the ferret and polecat belong
to different ſpecies, has been a ſubject of
doubt with ſome naturaliſts<note n="†" place="bottom">Linn, Syſt. ibid.</note>. The reſemblance
of colour of ſome ferrets to that of the polecat
may have given riſe to this doubt. The polecat,
however, is a native of temperate climates, and
is a wild animal, like the martin. But, the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
is a native of warm countries, and cannot
ſubſiſt, even in France, unleſs in a domeſtic ſtate.
The ferret alone is uſed in hunting rabbits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is more eaſily tamed than the polecat.
Both, indeed, have a ſtrong and diſagreeable
odour. But the moſt convincing proof of their
being different animals, is, that they have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe
with one another, and differ in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0195500104:311"/>
of eſſential characters. The body of the
ferret is thinner and more lengthened, his head
narrower, and his muzzle ſharper, than thoſe of
the polecat. He is not endowed with the ſame
inſtinct in finding ſubſiſtence, but, at leaſt in
our climates, muſt be carefully nouriſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
doors, and cannot exiſt in the fields; for thoſe
who are loſt in the burrows of rabbits never
multiply, but probably periſh during the winter.
The ferret alſo, like other domeſtic animals,
varies in colour; and is equally common in
warm regions<note n="*" place="bottom">The ferret is found in Barbary, and is called <hi>Nimſe.</hi> See Shaw's travels.</note>, as the polecat is rare.</p>
               <p>The female ferret is leſs than the male: When
in ſeaſon, ſhe is ſo extremely ardent, that, we
are aſſured, ſhe dies, if her deſires be not gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner. hiſt. quad. p. 763.</note>.
Ferrets are brought up in caſks or boxes,
where they are furniſhed with beds of hemp or
flax. They ſleep almoſt continually. Whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they awake, they ſearch eagerly for food,
which conſiſts of brawn, bread, milk, &amp;c. They
produce twice every year: The female goes ſix
weeks with young: Some of them devour their
young as ſoon as they are brought forth, inſtantly
come again in ſeaſon, and have three litters,
which generally conſiſt of five or ſix, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſeven or eight, and even nine.</p>
               <p>This animal is by nature a mortal enemy to
the rabbit. Whenever a dead rabbit is, for the
firſt time, preſented to a young ferret, he flies
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0195500104:312"/>
upon it, and bites it with fury; but, if it be
alive, he ſeizes it by the throat or the noſe, and
ſucks its blood. When let into the burrows of
rabbits, he is muzzled, that he may not kill them
in their holes, but only oblige them to come out,
in order to be caught in the nets. If the ferret
is let in without a muzzle, he is in danger of
being loſt; for, after ſucking the blood of the
rabbit, he falls aſleep; and even ſmoking the hole
is not a certain method of recalling him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the holes have often ſeveral entries which
communicate with each other, and the ferret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
into one of theſe, when incommoded with
the ſmoke. Boys likewiſe uſe the ferret for
catching birds in the holes of walls or of old
trees.</p>
               <p>According to Strabo, the ferret was brought
from Africa into Spain; which is by no means
improbable, as Spain is the native climate of rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
and the country where formerly theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
moſt abounded. It may, therefore, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
that, in order to diminiſh their number,
which perhaps was incommodious, ferrets were
imported for the purpoſe of hunting rabbits in a
profitable manner, in place of multiplying mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,
which would have deſtroyed the rabbits
without bringing any advantage to the hunters.</p>
               <p>The ferret, though eaſily tamed and rendered
docile, is extremely iraſcible. His odour is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
diſagreeable; but, when he is irritated, it
becomes much more offenſive. His eyes are
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0195500104:313"/>
lively, and his aſpect is inflammatory; all his
movements are nimble, and he is, at the ſame
time, ſo vigorous, that he can eaſily maſter a
rabbit, though at leaſt four times larger than
himſelf.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the authority of commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
it is ſtill uncertain whether the ferret be the
<hi>ictis</hi> of the Greeks. 'The ictis,' ſays Ariſtotle,
'is a ſpecies of wild weaſel, ſmaller than the
little Malteſe dog, but reſembling the weaſel
in its hair, in the whiteneſs of the under part
of the body, and likewiſe in the craftineſs of
its manners. It admits of being tamed; and
makes great havock among the bee-hives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extremely found of honey. It alſo attacks
birds, and, like the cat, has an oſſeous penis<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. anim. lib. 9. cap. 6.</note>.'
1. There appears to be a contradiction in ſaying
that the ictis is a ſpecies of wild weaſel, which
admits of being tamed; for the common weaſel,
which, in this country, is the moſt ſavage of the
two, is perfectly irreclaimable. 2. The ferret,
though larger than the weaſel, can never be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
for ſize, to the lap-dog. 3. The ferret
appears not to have the cunning of the weaſel,
nor indeed any craftineſs at all: Laſtly, he never
attacks the bee-hives, nor is he fond of honey.
I inquired of M. le Roi, inſpector of the royal
chaces, concerning this laſt fact. His anſwer
follows: 'M. de Buffon may be aſſured, that
the ferrets have no predilection for honey;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0195500104:314"/>
but, when hungry, may be made to eat to it.
I have fed them ſeveral days with bread ſoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in water mixed with honey. The two laſt
days, they eat it in pretty large quantities; but
the weakeſt of them began to be ſenſibly ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated.'
This is not the firſt time that M. le
Roi has obliged me with important facts. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no ferrets, I tried the ſame experiment on
the ermine, by giving him only pure honey to
eat, and a little milk for drink: But he died
in a few days. Thus neither the ermine nor the
ferret are fond of honey, like the ictis of the
antients; which inclines me to think, that the
word <hi>ictis</hi> is perhaps only a generic name; or,
if it marks any particular ſpecies, it ought rather
to be applied to the martin or polecat, both of
which poſſeſs the craftineſs of the weaſel, attack
the bee-hives, and are extremely fond of honey.</p>

regions. The ermine, on the contrary, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
in the north, is ſeldom met with in
temperate climates, and never in warm countries.
Theſe animals, therefore, form two diſtinct ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
The common weaſel ſometimes turns
white during the winter, even in our climate.
This circumſtance might give riſe to its being
regarded as of the ſame ſpecies with the ermine.
This mark is common to both: But there are
others in which they differ. The ermine is red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
in ſummer and white in winter; but the
end of its tail is uniformly black. The end of
the weaſel's tail is yellow, even when the animal
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0195500104:318"/>
turns white in winter. It is, beſides, always
leſs, and its tail much ſhorter than that of the
ermine. The weaſel dwells not, like the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
in woods and deſerts, but near the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of men. I have kept both ſpecies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but animals which differ in climate, in
conſtitution, and in diſpoſition, never intermix.
It is true, ſome weaſels are larger or ſmaller than
others; but the difference never exceeds an inch
in the whole length of the body. But the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
is two inches longer than the largeſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.
Neither of them can be tamed, but are
kept wild in iron cages. Neither of them
voluntarily eat honey, nor attack the bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hives,
like the polecat and martin. Thus
the ermine is not the ſavage weaſel, nor the
ictis of Ariſtotle, which, he ſays, is eaſily
tamed, and very fond of honey. The weaſel
and ermine, inſtead of being eaſily tamed, are ſo
wild, that they will not eat when any perſon
looks at them: They are in perpetual agitation,
always endeavouring to conceal themſelves: And,
if a man wants to keep them, he muſt furniſh
them with a bundle of wool or flax, in which
they wrap and hide themſelves from the light.
Thither they drag every thing they can lay hold
of, and never eat but in the night. They allow
freſh meat to lie three or four days, and even till
it corrupt, before they touch it. They ſleep
three fourths of the day, and watch their prey
during the night. When a weaſel gets among
the poultry, he attacks not the cocks or old hens,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0195500104:319"/>
but ſingles out the chickens and young birds,
whom he kills with a ſingle bite on the head,
and then carries off the whole one by one. He
likewiſe breaks the eggs, and ſucks them with
incredible avidity. In winter, they generally
live in granaries and barns, where they often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
during the ſpring, and bring forth their
young among the hay and ſtraw. During this
period, the female makes war, with more ſucceſs
than the cat, againſt the rats and mice, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eſcape her, becauſe ſhe follows them into
their holes. She mounts the pigeon-houſes,
and deſtroys the pigeons, ſparrows, &amp;c. In
ſummer, they retire farther from houſes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
into low grounds, about mills, along rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
conceal themſelves among bruſh-wood, in
order to ſurpriſe birds, and often take up their
abode in old willows, where the female brings
forth her young: She prepares for them a bed
of ſtraw, leaves, and other herbage, and litters,
in the ſpring, from three to five. The young,
like thoſe of the polecat, pine-weaſel, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
are born blind; but they very ſoon acquire
growth and ſtrength enough to follow their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the chace. The weaſels attack ſerpents,
water-rats, moles, field-mice, &amp;c. and, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
the meadows, they devour quails and
partridges, together with their eggs. Their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
conſiſts of inequal and precipitant leaps;
and, when they want to mount a tree, they make
a ſudden bound, by which they are at once ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0195500104:320"/>
ſeveral feet high. They leap in the ſame
manner when they attempt to ſeize a bird.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals, as well as the polecat and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
have a diſagreeable odour, which is ſtronger
in ſummer than in winter; and, when purſued
or irritated, their ſmell is felt at a conſiderable
diſtance. They move always with caution and
with ſilence, and never cry, but when they are
hurt. Their cry is ſharp, rough, and very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
of reſentment. As their own odour is
offenſive, they ſeem not to be ſenſible of a bad
ſmell in other bodies. A peaſant in my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
took three new-littered weaſels out of
the carcaſs of a wolf that had been hung on a
tree by the hind feet. The wolf was almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
putrified, and the female weaſel had made
a neſt of leaves and herbage for her young in
the thorax of this putrid carcaſs.</p>

<hi>ermine</hi> when it is white, and the <hi>roſelet</hi> when it
is red or yellowiſh. Though leſs frequent than
the ordinary weaſel, they are ſtill found in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
numbers, eſpecially in the antient fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
and ſometimes, during winter, in fields
bordering upon woods. It is eaſy, at all ſeaſons,
to diſtinguiſh them from the common weaſel;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0195500104:323"/>
for the end of their tail is always of a deep black,
and the borders of the ears and toes are white.</p>
               <p>We have little to add to what we formerly
remarked concerning this animal<note n="*" place="bottom">See above, article Weaſel.</note>. We ſhall
only obſerve, that it changes its colour, as uſual,
in winter. I had one ſent me, in the beginning of
March 1757, which was then white. I kept it
till April 1758, when it would probably have
become white, had it been at liberty; but it was
confined in an iron cage, againſt the bars of
which it perpetually rubbed, and, as it had not
been ſufficiently expoſed to the cold, it ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
its ſummer coat. It remains as ſavage as
ever, and has loſt nothing of its bad ſmell. In
every other circumſtance, it is a healthy vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
animal, has lively eyes, a fine countenance,
and movements ſo rapid, that it is impoſſible to
follow them with the eye. It has always been
fed with eggs and fleſh; but it touches not meat
till it has become putrid. It never inclined to
eat honey; and, being deprived of victuals for
three days, it died, after having taken a ſmall
quantity of honey. The ſkin of this animal is

by Kolbe<note n="*" place="bottom">Deſcript. du Cap de Bonne-eſperance, p. 54.</note>, and whoſe fleſh, he remarks, is

to the weaſel tribe. His ſkin is white, except
the tail, which is ſpotted with black. The furs

better than thoſe of Ruſſia, which ſooner
turn yellowiſh; and, for this reaſon, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
are of greater requeſt, even at Peterſburg.

particularly fond of eggs, and, when the ſea is
calm, he ſwims over to the iſlands which lie near
the coaſt of Norway, where there are vaſt
quantities of ſea fowls. It is alledged, that,
when the female brings forth on an iſland, ſhe
conducts her young to the continent, upon a
piece of wood, piloting them with her ſnout.
This animal, though ſmall, kills thoſe of a

He jumps into one of their ears when they

               <p>THE ſquirrel is a little neat animal, and may
be conſidered as in a ſtate between ſavage
and domeſtic. The gentleneſs, docility, and
inoffenſiveneſs of his manners, entitle him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
and protection. Though he ſometimes
ſeizes birds, he is neither carnivorous nor deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
Fruits, almonds, nuts, beech-maſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns,
are his common food. He is handſome,
lively, alert, and extremely vigilant and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious.
He has eyes full of fire, a fine counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
a nervous body, and very nimble limbs.
The beauty of his figure is heightened by a tail
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0195500104:332"/>
reſembling a plume of feathers, which he
raiſes the length of his head, and under which
he ſhades himſelf from the ſun and weather.
The under part of his body is furniſhed with an
apparatus equally remarkable, and which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
ſtrong generative powers. The ſquirrel
partakes leſs of the nature of quadrupeds than
moſt others of that tribe. He generally reſts
almoſt on end, and uſes his fore-feet like hands,
in carrying his food to his mouth. Inſtead of
concealing himſelf under the earth, he is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in the air. He approaches the birds by
his lightneſs; and, like the feathered tribes, he
dwells on the tops of trees, and traverſes the foreſts
by leaping from one tree to another. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
builds his neſt in the trees, gathers grains
and ſeeds, drinks the dews, and deſcends not to the
earth, but when the trees are agitated by ſtorms.
He is never found in the open fields, nor in the
plains. He approaches not the habitations of
men, and never remains among bruſhwood; but
delights in the lofty trees of the foreſt. Of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he is ſtill more afraid than of the earth; and
we are aſſured, that, when he wants to paſs a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
or lake, he employs the bark of a tree for a
ſhip, and uſes his tail for the rudder and ſails<note n="*" place="bottom">Rei veritate nititur quod Geſnerus ex Vincentio Beluan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſi et Olao Magno refert, ſciuros, quando aquam tranſire cupiunt, lignum leviſſimum aquae imponere; eique inſidentes, et cauda, non tamen ut vult, erecta, ſed continuo mota, velifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes neque flante vento, ſed tranquillo aequore tranſvehi, quod fide dignus, fiduſque meus emiſſarius ad inſulas Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiae, plus ſimplici vice obſervavit, et cum ſpoliis in littori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ibidem collectis redux mirabundus mihi retulit; <hi>Diſſert. de Sciuro volante.

He ſleeps not, like the dormouſe, during the
winter, but is at all ſeaſons awake and lively;
and, if the foot of the tree where he repoſes be
touched, he inſtantly leaves his little neſt, and
flies to another tree, or ſhelters himſelf under a
branch. He collects nuts during ſummer, hides
them in the trunks or hollows of old trees, and
has recourſe to them for his winter food: He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſearches for them in the ſnow, and ſcratches
off the ſurface of it with his feet. His voice
is ſhrill, and ſtill more piercing than that of the
martin. When irritated, he makes a murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or grumbling noiſe. He is too light for
walking; his movements conſiſt of little leaps;
and ſometimes he makes conſiderable bounds.
His claws are ſo ſharp, and his motion ſo quick,
that he inſtantaneouſly climbs beech trees, though
their bark be exceedingly ſmooth.</p>
               <p>During the fine ſummer nights, the ſquirrels
are heard crying, when purſuing each other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the trees. They ſeem to dread the heat
of the ſun; for, during the day, they remain in
their neſts, from which they iſſue, in the night,
to eat, to frolick, and to make love. Their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is clean, warm, impenetrable to rain, and
generally ſituated in the cleft of a tree. They
begin the work by carrying ſmall ſticks,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0195500104:334"/>
which they mix and interlace with moſs: They
then preſs and ſtamp it, to give it firmneſs and
capacity for holding themſelves and their young.
Only a ſmall ſtrait aperture is left near the top,
hardly ſufficient to allow them to paſs. Above
this aperture is a conical cover which ſhelters the
whole, and makes the rain run off the ſides.
They generally produce three or four at a litter:
The females come in ſeaſon in the ſpring, and
bring forth in May, or the beginning of June.
They caſt their hair in winter, and the new fur
is redder than the former. They comb and
dreſs themſelves with their hands and teeth, are
very cleanly, and have no bad ſmell. Their
fleſh makes pretty good eating. The hair of
their tail is uſed for pencils; but their ſkin is
only an indifferent fur.</p>
               <p>Several ſpecies of quadrupeds border upon
that of the ſquirrel; but there are few varieties
in the ſpecies itſelf. Some are of an aſh-colour;
but the greateſt number are reddiſh. The ſmall

                  <p>It was formerly remarked, that there are black
ſquirrels in America. M. Aubry, curate of Saint-Louis,
has, in his cabinet, a ſquirrel, ſent him
from Martinico, which is totally black. It is alſo
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0195500104:336"/>
diſtinguiſhed from other ſquirrels by having no
hair, or at leaſt a very ſmall quantity, on its ears.</p>
                  <p>M. de la Borde, King's phyſician at Cayenne,
remarks, that, in Guiana, there is only one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of ſquirrel, which lives in the woods; that
its hair is reddiſh; that it exceeds not the ſize of
an European rat; that it feeds on the grain of
the <hi>Maripa, Aoura, Comana,</hi> &amp;c.; that it brings
forth its young to the number of two, in the
holes of trees; that it bites like a rat; that it is
eaſily tamed; that it makes a kind of low whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
cry; and that it is always ſeen alone, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from branch to branch.</p>
                  <p>I am not certain that this animal, mentioned
by M. de la Borde, is a real ſquirrel; for theſe
animals, in general, are not found in very warm
climates, ſuch as that of Guiana. The ſpecies,
on the contrary, is very numerous in the cold
and temperate regions of both Continents.</p>
                  <p>'We find,' ſays M. Kalm, 'ſeveral ſpecies of

The large ſquirrels do much miſchief
to the plantations of maize. They cut the
ſtems, in order to eat the pith. They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
come in hundreds into a field, and often
devour the whole wheat in a ſingle night. In
order to deſtroy them, a price is put upon their
heads. The inhabitants eat the fleſh of the
ſquirrels, but put little value on their ſkins<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage de Kalm, tom. 2. p. 245.</note>.

The gray ſquirrels are common in Penſylvania,
and in ſeveral other parts of North America.
In figure, they reſemble thoſe of Sweden; but,
both in ſummer and winter, they preſerve their
gray colour, and are likewiſe ſomewhat larger.
They build their neſts with moſs and ſtraw in
the hollows of trees. They feed upon the
fruits of the woods, but prefer the maize. They
lay up proviſions for winter, and remain in
their magazines during the great colds. Theſe
animals not only do much injury to the maize,
but likewiſe to the oaks, the flowers of which
they devour, ſo that the trees produce few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns. . . . . It is alledged, that they are

               <p>NATURE, by deſcending gradually from
great to ſmall, from ſtrong to weak, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalances
every part of her works. Attentive
ſolely to the preſervation of each ſpecies, ſhe
creates a profuſion of individuals, and ſupports
by numbers the ſmall and the feeble, whom ſhe
hath left unprovided with arms or with courage.
She has not only put thoſe inferior animals in a
condition to perpetuate and to reſiſt by their own
numbers, but ſhe ſeems, at the ſame time, to
have afforded a ſupply to each by multiplying
the neighbouring ſpecies. The rat, the mouſe,
the field-mouſe, the water-rat, the ſhort tailed
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0195500104:340"/>
field mouſe, the fat ſquirrel, the garden ſquirrel,
the dormouſe, the ſhrew-mouſe, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whom I mention not, becauſe they belong
not to our climate, form ſo many diſtinct and
ſeparate ſpecies, but ſo analogous to each other,
that, if any one ſhould happen to fail, the gap
in the genus would hardly be perceptible. It is
this great number of neighbouring ſpecies which
hath given to naturaliſts the idea of genera; an
idea which can only be employed when we view
objects in general, but which vaniſhes whenever
we conſider nature in detail.</p>
               <p>Men at firſt gave diſtinct names to objects which
appeared to differ from each other; and, at the
ſame time, they gave general denominations to
objects that ſeemed to be nearly ſimilar. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
a rude people, and in the infancy of all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
there is hardly any thing but general
terms, or vague and ill-formed expreſſions for
objects of the ſame order, though very different
from each other. An oak, a beech, a linden-tree,
a fir, a pine, a yew, would, at firſt, have
no other name but that of <hi>a tree</hi>; afterwards the
oak, the beech, and the yew, would all be called
<hi>oak</hi>; when theſe were diſtinguiſhed from the fir,
the pine, and the yew, the three latter would be
called <hi>fir.</hi> Particular names could only be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
in conſequence of a minute examination
of each different ſpecies; and the numbers of
theſe names are augmented in proportion to the
extent of our knowledge of Nature: The more
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0195500104:341"/>
we examine her, proper and particular names
will become more frequent. When natural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
therefore, are repreſented to us, under ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
denominations, or by claſſes and genera, it
is recalling the darkneſs peculiar to the infant
ſtate of human knowledge. Ignorance is the
parent of genera; but ſcience will for ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to create and to multiply proper names;
and I ſhall never heſitate in adding to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as often as I have occaſion to delineate dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Several ſpecies of ſmall animals have been
confounded under the generic name of <hi>Rat</hi>: But
we ſhall confine this name ſolely to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
rat, which is of a blackiſh colour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
the habitations of men. The rat common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
frequents granaries and barns, and from
thence, when food is ſcarce, comes into our
houſes. He is a carnivorous, or rather an om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivorous
animal: He ſeems only to prefer hard
ſubſtances to thoſe which are tender or ſucculent.
He gnaws linen, cloaths, furniture, makes holes
in the walls, lodges in the ceilings, and in the
void ſpaces between the wall and the wainſcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
From theſe lurking places the rats iſſue in
queſt of food, and tranſport thither every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
they can drag, forming conſiderable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines,
eſpecially when they have young to
provide for. The female brings forth ſeveral
times a year, but always in the ſummer ſeaſon.
The litter generally conſiſts of five or ſix. They
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0195500104:342"/>
are fond of warmth, and, in winter, inſinuate
themſelves near the chimneys, or lodge among
hay or ſtraw: In ſpite of cats, poiſon, and ſnares,
theſe animals multiply ſo greatly, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
do much damage. In old country-houſes
where grain is kept, and where the vicinity of
barns and magazines of hay facilitates their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
they often increaſe ſo prodigiouſly, that
the poſſeſſors are obliged to remove and deſert
their habitations, unleſs the rats happen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
each other. It is well known, that rats,
when pinched for food, eat one another. When
a famine is created by too great a number being
crouded into one place, the ſtrong kill the weak,
open their heads, and firſt eat the brain, and then
the reſt of the body. Next day, the war is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
and continues in the ſame manner till
moſt of them are deſtroyed. This is the reaſon
why theſe animals, after being extremely trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
diſappear all of a ſudden, and return not
for a long time. The ſame thing happens to
field-mice, whoſe prodigious multiplication is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
only by the hoſtilities they exerciſe on
each other, when proviſions become ſcarce. This
ſudden deſtruction is aſcribed by Ariſtotle to the
operation of rains. But rats are not expoſed to
rain, and the field-mice know how to guard
themſelves againſt its effects; for the holes they
inhabit are not even moiſt.</p>
               <p>The rats are as laſcivious as they are voraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
They ſqueak during their amours, and cry
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0195500104:343"/>
when they fight. They prepare a bed for their
young, and ſoon learn them to eat. When the
young begin to iſſue from their hole, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
watches, defends, and even fights with the
cats, in order to ſave them. A large rat is more
miſchievous, and nearly as ſtrong as a young
cat. The fore-teeth of the rat are long and
ſtrong: The cat is not a good biter; and, as ſhe
uſes only her claws, ſhe requires both to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
and accuſtomed to fight. The weaſel,
though ſmaller, is a more dangerous and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
enemy, becauſe he follows the rat into his
hole. Their ſtrength being nearly equal, the
combat often continues long: But the method of
uſing their arms is very different. The rat wounds
only by reiterated ſtrokes with his fore-teeth,
which are rather deſtined for gnawing than bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
and, being ſituated at the extremity of the
lever, or jaw, they have not much force. But
the weaſel bites cruelly with the whole jaw, and,
inſtead of letting go his hold, he ſucks the blood
from the wounded part; and, therefore, the rat
uniformly falls a ſacrifice to the weaſel.</p>
               <p>Of this ſpecies, as in all thoſe which conſiſt of
numerous individuals, there are many varieties.
Beſide the common rat, which is blackiſh, ſome
are brown, others gray, reddiſh, and even totally
white. The white rats have red eyes, like the
white rabbit, the white mouſe, and all the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
which are perfectly white. The whole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and its varieties, appear to be natives of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0195500104:344"/>
temperate climates, and are more diffuſed over
the warm than the cold regions. There were no
rats originally in America<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>Pontoppidan remarks, 'that neither the wood
nor water rats can live farther north than Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
that there are ſeveral diſtricts, as that of

in the dioceſe of Aggerhum, where no rats are

                  <p>M. le Vicomte de Querhoënt has favoured me
with the following remarks: That the rats, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
from Europe to the Iſle of France, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſuch a degree, that, it is alledged, they
made the Dutch leave the iſland. The French
have diminiſhed the number, though great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of them ſtill remain. Some time, adds M.
de Querhoënt, after a rat reſides in India, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
ſo ſtrong a ſmell of muſk, that he ſcents
every thing for a conſiderable ſpace round his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation;
and it is alledged, that, when he comes
near wine, he makes it turn ſour.—This Indian
rat appears to be the ſame which the Portugueſe
call <hi>Cheroſo,</hi> or odoriferous rat. La Boullaye-le-Gouz
ſays, 'that it is very ſmall, and nearly of

               <p>THE Mouſe is much ſmaller, equally nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and more generally diffuſed than the
rat. It has the ſame inſtinct, the ſame conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and natural diſpoſitions, and differs only by
its weakneſs, and the habits which reſult from this
circumſtance. Timid by nature, and familiar
from neceſſity, fear and want are the ſources of
all its movements. He never iſſues from his hole
but in queſt of food, and runs in again upon the
leaſt alarm. He goes not, like the rat, from
houſe to houſe, unleſs he be forced, and is not
near ſo deſtructive. His manners are gentle, and
he may be tamed to a certain degree; but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0195500104:347"/>
diſcovers the ſmalleſt attachment to his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.
It is not, indeed, eaſy to love thoſe who
are perpetually laying ſnares for us. Though
weak, the mouſe has many enemies, from whom
he has no means of eſcape, but thoſe of agility
and minuteneſs. Owls, birds of prey, cats, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and even rats, make war upon the mice.
They are ſhot, caught in traps, and deſtroyed
by millions. In a word, they ſubſiſt by their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
fecundity alone.</p>
               <p>They bring forth at all ſeaſons, and ſeveral
times in the year. The litter generally conſiſts
of five or ſix. In leſs than fifteen days, the
young are ſtrong enough to diſperſe, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
food for themſelves. The duration of life
in thoſe ſmall animals muſt, therefore, be ſhort,
ſince their growth is ſo rapid; and this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
ſtill farther augments the idea of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
multiplication. Ariſtotle tells us, that,
having ſhut up a pregnant mouſe in a veſſel, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with plenty of grain, he, in a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
found 120 mice, all ſprung from the ſame
mother.</p>
               <p>Theſe little animals are by no means ugly;
they have a vivacious and elegant air. That ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of horror ſome people feel at them, ariſes
from the ſurpriſe and inconveniencies they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
occaſion. All mice are whitiſh under the
belly, and ſome are altogether white. Others are
more or leſs brown and black. The ſpecies is
generally diffuſed over Europe, Aſia, and Africa;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0195500104:348"/>
and, it is alledged, that thoſe of America, where
they are very numerous, came originally from the
Old Continent. It is, however, certain, that this
little animal follows man, and flies from uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
places, probably on account of its natural
appetite for bread, cheeſe, butter, oil, and other
aliment which men prepare for themſelves.</p>

                  <p>White mice, with red eyes, are found not only
in our temperate climates, but in the ſouthern

               <p>THIS animal is leſs than the rat, and larger
than the mouſe. It never lives in houſes,
but is found in the fields and woods. Its eyes are
remarkably large and prominent; and it differs
ſtill more from the rat and mouſe, by the colour
of its hair, which is whitiſh under the belly, and
of a reddiſh brown on the back. It is very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and copiouſly diffuſed, eſpecially in elevated
countries. It ſeems to take a conſiderable time in
arriving at full growth, becauſe it varies greatly
in ſize. The largeſt are between four and five
inches long; and the ſmaller ones, which appear
likewiſe to be adults, are an inch ſhorter. And,
as we find them of all intermediate ſizes, both the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0195500104:350"/>
great and ſmall are unqueſtionably the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
Ignorance of this fact has, probably, led
ſome naturaliſts to make two ſpecies of them, the
one called <hi>the great field-rat,</hi> and the other <hi>the
field-mouſe.</hi> Ray, who firſt fell into this blunder,
ſeems to acknowledge that he knew but one
ſpecies<note n="*" place="bottom">De hac ſpecie mihi non undequaque ſatisfactum eſt; <hi>Ray, ſynopſ. quad. p.</hi> 219.</note>. And, though the ſhort deſcriptions he
has given each ſpecies appear to differ, we ought not
to conclude that both exiſt: 1. Becauſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
knew but one; 2. Becauſe, after all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches
I have made, I have not been able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
more than one kind; becauſe Geſner, and
other naturaliſts, mention only one ſpecies, under
the name of <hi>mus agreſtis major,</hi> which they ſay
is very common; and becauſe Ray ſays that the
other kind, called <hi>mus domeſticus medius,</hi> is alſo
very common: Hence, it is apparent, that none
of theſe authors have ever ſeen both kinds, ſince
they acknowledge both to be very common; 4.
Becauſe, in this ſingle ſpecies, individuals are
found of a larger and leſſer ſize, this circumſtance
might lead them to conſider the ſmall as of one
ſpecies, and the large of another; Laſtly, becauſe
the deſcriptions are too vague and inaccurate to
eſtabliſh a ſpecific difference.</p>
               <p>The antients, indeed, mention two ſpecies, the
one under the denomination of <hi>mus agreſtis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi>
the other under that of <hi>mus agreſtis minor.</hi>
Theſe two ſpecies are very common, and we know
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0195500104:351"/>
them as well as the antients: The firſt is our long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
field-mouſe; the ſecond is not the <hi>mus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticus
medius</hi> of Ray, but another animal,
known by the name of the <hi>ſhort-tailed field-mouſe,</hi>
or <hi>little field-rat.</hi> And, as it differs both from
the rat and the long-tailed field-mouſe, I have
given it its Italian name, <hi>compagnoli</hi> or <hi>compag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The long-tailed field-mouſe, as I formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maked,
lives in dry and elevated grounds. In
the woods and adjacent fields, they are found in
vaſt numbers. They retire into holes among the
bruſhwood and under the trunks of trees, where
they amaſs great quantities of acorns, nuts, and
beech-maſt; ſometimes a whole buſhel is found
in a ſingle hole; and this hoard is not propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the wants of the animal, but to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of the place where it is depoſited. Theſe
holes are generally more than a foot under ground,
and often divided into two apartments, the one
for living in along with their young, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a magazine. I have frequently ſeen great
damage done to the plantations by theſe animals.
They carry off the new ſown acorns; by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the furrow of the plough, they dig up one
after another, not leaving a ſngle ſeed. This
happens chiefly in thoſe ſeaſons when the acorns
are ſcarce: Not finding enough in the woods,
they come in queſt of them in the cultivated fields,
and do not eat them on the ſpot, but tranſport
them to their holes, where they amaſs ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0195500104:352"/>
tities, that they often corrupt. Theſe creatures
alone do more miſchief in a nurſery of trees than
all the birds and other animals put together. The
only way to prevent this damage is, to lay traps at
ten paces aſunder through the extent of the ſown
ground. No other apparatus is neceſſary than a
roaſted walnut placed under a flat ſtone, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a ſtick. The animals come to eat the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,
which they prefer to acorns; and, as the
walnut is fixed to the ſtick, whenever they touch
it, the ſtone falls and cruſhes them to death. I
have uſed the ſame expedient for the deſtruction
of the ſhort-tailed field-mouſe, who likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
acorns. When I began this operation, I
deſired all the mice that were caught by the traps
to be brought to me, and found, with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that above 100 were taken each day, from
a piece of ground conſiſting only of about 40
French arpents. From the 15th of November to
the 8th of December, above 2000 were ſlain in
this manner. Their numbers gradually decreaſed
till the froſt became ſevere, when they retire to
their holes, and feed upon the magazines they
have collected. It is more than 20 years ſince I
made this trial, which I always repeated when I
ſowed tree-ſeeds, and never failed to catch vaſt
quantities of theſe mice. They abound chiefly
in autumn, their numbers being much leſs in the
ſpring: For, if proviſions fail during the winter,
the ſtrong devour the weak. The long-tailed
field mice likewiſe eat the ſhort-tailed ſpecies, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0195500104:353"/>
even thruſhes, blackbirds, and other birds which
they find entangled in ſnares. They firſt eat the
brain, and then the reſt of the body. I once
kept a dozen of theſe mice in a cage, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with food every morning at eight o'clock.
One day they were neglected for about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour, when one of their number was
eaten up by the reſt; next day another fuffered
the ſame fate; and, in a few days, only one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained:
All the others had been killed, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
devoured; and even the ſurvivor himſelf had
his feet and tail mutilated.</p>
               <p>The rat is very prolific; but the long-tailed
field-mouſe is more ſo. The latter brings forth
more than once a year, and the litters often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of nine or ten, while thoſe of the rat never
exceed five or ſix. In one hole I have found two
mothers and twenty young. This animal is very
generally diffuſed over Europe. It is found in
Sweden, and is called by Linnaeus<note n="*" place="bottom">Faun. Suec. p. 11.</note>

               <p>THIS animal is about the ſize of a rat; but,
from its manners and diſpoſitions, has a
much greater reſemblance to the otter than to
the common rat. Like the otter, it frequents
the freſh water, and is found on the margins of
rivers, brooks, and pools, and lives moſtly on
fiſhes. Gudgeons, minnows, blays, and the fry
of carps, pikes, and barbels, are its ordinary food.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0195500104:355"/>
He likewiſe eats frogs, water-inſects, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the roots of plants. He has not, like the
otter, membranes between his toes. This error
has been copied from Willoughby by Ray and
other naturaliſts. Though all his toes be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate,
he ſwims with eaſe, keeps long under
the water, and carries off his prey to be devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the graſs, or in his hole. He is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſurpriſed by fiſhers when ſearching for
craw-fiſh; and he endeavours to eſcape by biting
their fingers, or leaping into the water. His
head is ſhorter, his muzzle thicker, his hair more
buſhy, and his tail much ſhorter, than thoſe of
the rat. Like the otter, he avoids large rivers,
or rather thoſe which are much frequented. He
never viſits houſes or barns, but keeps upon the
margins of waters, from which he wanders not
upon dry land ſo far as the otter, who is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
found at the diſtance of a league from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Water-rats are ſeldom met with in elevated
places, or in dry plains, but are extremely nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
in moiſt and marſhy vallies. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
come in ſeaſon about the end of winter,
and bring forth in the month of April, the litter
generally conſiſting of ſix or ſeven. Perhaps
they bring forth more than once a year; but of
this we have no proper knowledge. Their fleſh
is not intollerably bad, being eaten by the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants,
as well as the otter, during the ſeaſon of
lent. They are found every where over Europe,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0195500104:356"/>
excepting in the polar regions. If we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
Bellon, they inhabit the banks of the Nile:
However, the figure he gives of them has ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
reſemblance to our water-rat, that it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Nile rats form a different ſpecies of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>

               <p>THE Short-tailed Field-mouſe is ſtill more
common and more generally diffuſed than
the long-tailed kind. The latter never appears
in high grounds; but the former is found every
where, in the woods, the fields, the meadows,
and even in the gardens. It is remarkable for
the thickneſs of its head, and the ſhortneſs of its
tail, which exceeds not an inch in length. It
digs holes in the earth, where it amaſſes grain,
filberts, and acorns: But it appears to prefer corn
to every other food. In the month of July,
when the grain is ripe, the ſhort-tailed field-mice
aſſemble from all quarters, and often do great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0195500104:360"/>
by cutting the ſtalks of the corn, in order
to come at the ears. They follow the reapers,
and eat up all the fallen or neglected grain.
When the gleanings are devoured, they flock
to the new-ſown fields, and prematurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the crop of the enſuing year. In winter,
moſt of them retire into the woods, where they
feed upon filberts, acorns, and the ſeeds of trees.
In particular years, they appear in numbers ſo
immenſe, that they would deſtroy every thing,
if they continued long: But they always kill and
eat one another during a ſcarcity of proviſions.
They, beſides, become the prey of the long-tailed
field-mouſe, the fox, the wild cat, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
               <p>In its internal ſtructure, this animal reſembles
the water-rat more than any other; but differs
from him externally by ſeveral eſſential charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
1. By the ſize; the ſhort-tailed field mouſe
is not above three inches long; but the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
is ſeven inches: 2. By the dimenſions of the
head and body, thoſe of the former being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally
thicker than thoſe of the latter: 3. By
the length of the tail, which, in this field-mouſe,
exceeds not a third of the length of the animal's
body; but the length of the tail of the water-rat
is near two thirds of its body: Laſtly, By its
manners and diſpoſitions: It feeds not upon fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
nor goes into water, but nouriſhes itſelf with
acorns, corn, and tuberous roots, ſuch as thoſe of
the dandelion, &amp;c. Their holes reſemble thoſe

of the long-tailed field-mouſe, and are often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into two apartments; but they are neither
ſo ſpacious nor ſo deep in the earth. Several of
them frequently live together. When the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
are about to bring forth, they make beds
of herbs for their young. They produce in
ſpring and ſummer, and the litter generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of five or ſix, and ſometimes of ſeven or

               <p>THIS little animal, though a native of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil
and of Guiney, lives and propagates in
the temperate, and even in the cold climates,
when protected from the inclemency of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Though they multiply prodigiouſly in
France, their numbers are never great; becauſe
the care they require is not compenſated by the
profits ariſing from them. Their ſkin is hardly
of any value, and their fleſh, though eatable, is
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0195500104:364"/>
not ſo good as to be much demanded; but, it
might be improved, by keeping them in warrens,
where they would have the benefit of freſh air,
and the liberty of chooſing herbs agreeable to
their taſte. Thoſe kept in houſes have nearly
the ſame bad taſte with warren-rabbits; and
thoſe kept in gardens during ſummer, have an
inſipid, but leſs diſagreeable ſavour.</p>
               <p>The temperament of theſe animals is ſo hot
and premature, that they copulate five or ſix
weeks after their birth. They acquire not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
their full growth before the 8th or 9th
month. But this increaſe of ſize conſiſts only of
fat; for the ſolid parts are fully unfolded before the
age of ſix months. The females go with young
only three weeks; and I have known them bring
forth at the age of two months. The firſt litter
conſiſts of four or five; the ſecond of five or ſix;
and the ſucceeding ones of ſeven or eight, and
ſometimes of ten or twelve. The mother ſuckles
her young twelve or fifteen days; ſhe baniſhes
them as ſoon as ſhe receives the male, which
happens, at fartheſt, three weeks after her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
and, if any of them perſiſt in following
her, they are maletreated and ſlain by the father.
Thus theſe animals produce at leaſt every two
months; and, as their young bring forth in the
ſame ſpace, we are aſtoniſhed at their rapid and
numerous multiplication. From a ſingle couple
we may have 1000 in one year. But their
deſtruction is as rapid as their propagation. They
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0195500104:365"/>
are killed by cold and by moiſture; they allow
themſelves, without reſiſtance, to be eaten by the
cats; even the mothers defend not their young
from their deſtroyers; not having time to form
an attachment to their young, they make no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
to ſave them. The males are ſtill leſs ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
about their offspring, and even allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be devoured, without reſiſtance. They
ſeem to have no diſtinct ſentiment, but that of
love. When under the influence of this paſſion,
they are ſuſceptible of anger, fight cruelly, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
kill each other in diſputing the poſſeſſion of
a female. They paſs their lives in ſleeping, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and amours. Their ſleep is ſhort, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
they eat every hour, both day and night;
and they indulge in mutual embraces as often as
they eat. Though perpetually throwing out
urine, they never drink. They feed on all kinds
of herbs, but eſpecially on parſley, which they
prefer to grain or to bread. They are likewiſe
fond of apples and other fruits. They eat preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitantly,
like the rabbit, little at a time, but very
often. They make a kind of grunting noiſe, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
to that of a young pig. A kind of chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
noiſe marks the time of their amours, and
they raiſe a ſharp cry when they feel pain. They
are extremely delicate, and ſo impatient of cold,
that it is difficult to preſerve them through the
winter. They muſt be kept in a dry, warm,
wholeſome place. When they feel cold, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
and crowd cloſe together; and they often

knows many things, and the hedge-hog but
one important thing,' is a proverbial ſaying
of the antients<note n="†" place="bottom">Zenodotus, Plutarchus, et alii ex Archilocho.</note>. The latter knows how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himſelf without fighting, and to wound
without making an attack. Having little ſtrength,
and leſs agility for flight, he has received from
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0195500104:369"/>
Nature a ſpinous armour, with the faculty of rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
himſelf up like a ball, and of preſenting on
all ſides thoſe ſharp weapons, which repel the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
The more he is haraſſed, he rolls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
up the cloſer. His fears tend ſtill farther to
defend him; for, by throwing out his urine, the
ſmell and humidity of which ſpreads over his
whole body, he completely diſguſts the enemy.
Thus moſt dogs content themſelves with barking,
and never chooſe to ſeize the hedge-hog. The
fox, however, accompliſhes his end, by wounding
the animal's feet, and making the blood run into
its mouth. But the hedge-hog is proof againſt the
weaſel, the martin, the polecat, the ferret, and birds
of prey. From the head to the tail, both male
and female are equally covered with ſpines, and
only the under parts of their bodies are garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with hair. But thoſe arms, which are ſo uſeful
to them in defending againſt enemies, become
exceeding inconvenient when they want to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.
They cannot copulate in the manner of
other quadrupeds, but face to face, either on end,
or lying. The females come in ſeaſon in the
ſpring, and bring forth in the beginning of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
I have frequently had the mother and her
young brought to me in the month of June. The
litter generally conſiſts of three or four, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of five. When very young, they are white,
and the buds of the ſpines are only viſible through
the ſkin. I tried to rear ſome of them, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the mother and her young in a barrel, with,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0195500104:370"/>
plenty of proviſions: But, in place of ſuckling,
ſhe devoured them one after another. This was
not the effect of hunger; for ſhe eat bread, meat,
and fruits. One would never have imagined that
an animal ſo ſlow and indolent, could be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of confinement. It even poſſeſſes the
ſame ſpecies of malevolence with that of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key.
A hedge-hog that had ſlipped into the
kitchen, took the meat out of a ſmall kettle, and
defiled it with his ordure. I kept males and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
in a room together; but, though they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
they never coupled. I left ſeveral of them
in my gardens, where they did ſo little miſchief,
that it could hardly be perceived. They live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fallen fruits; and dig the earth to a ſmall
depth with their noſes. They eat may-bugs,
beetles, graſhoppers, worms, and ſome roots.
They are likewiſe fond of fleſh-meat, which they
devour either raw or roaſted. In the country,
they are frequently found in the woods, under
the trunks of old trees, in the cliffs of rocks, and
particularly among the ſtones collected upon the
fields and vineyards. I am uncertain whether
they climb trees, as ſome naturaliſts aſſert<note n="*" place="bottom">

They ſeize with the mouth every thing they eat;

without food. Their blood is nearly as cold as

               <p>THE Shrew Mouſe ſeems to form a link in
the chain of ſmall animals, and to fill the
interval between the rat and the mole, which,
though they reſemble each other in ſize, differ
greatly in figure, and are very diſtant ſpecies.
The ſhrew is ſtill ſmaller than the mouſe, and has
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0195500104:375"/>
an affinity to the mole, by its long noſe; by its
eyes, which, though larger than thoſe of the
mole, are much concealed, and more minute than
thoſe of the mouſe; by the number of its toes,
having five on each foot; by the tail and legs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
the hind-legs, which are ſhorter than
thoſe of the mouſe; by the ears; and, laſtly, by
the teeth. This little animal has a ſtrong and
peculiar odour, which is very diſagreeable to the
cats, who purſue and kill, but never eat the ſhrews.
It is probably this bad ſmell, and the reluctance
of the cats, which have given riſe to the vulgar
prejudice, that the bite of the ſhrew-mouſe is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous,
and particulary hurtful to horſes. But
the ſhrew is neither venomous, nor is it capable
of biting; for the aperture of its mouth is not
large enough to take in a duplicature of another
animal's ſkin, which is abſolutely neceſſary to the
action of biting. The diſeaſe of horſes, vulgarly
aſcribed to the bite of the ſhrew-mouſe, is a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or blotch, and proceeds from an internal cauſe,
which has no relation to a bite. This animal,
eſpecially in winter, frequents hay-lofts, ſtables,
barns, and dung-hills. It feeds upon grain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects,
and putrid fleſh. In the country, it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
the woods, and lives upon grain. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals
itſelf under moſs and the leaves and trunks
of trees, and ſometimes in the holes abandoned
by the mole, or in ſmaller holes which it digs
with its muzzle and claws. The ſhrew produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
an equal number, though not ſo frequently,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0195500104:376"/>
as the mouſe. Its cry is alſo much ſharper; but
it is not near ſo agile. It is eaſily taken;
becauſe it both ſees and runs badly. The colour
of the ſhrew is a mixture of brown and red; but
ſome are aſh-coloured, and others nearly black,
though all of them are white under the belly.
They are very common in Europe; but they ſeem
not to exiſt in America. The Braſilian animal
mentioned by Marcgrave<note n="*" place="bottom">Marcgravii hiſt. Braſil. p. 229.</note>, under the name of

prodigious quantity of ſeminal fluid, enormous
teſticles, a penis of immoderate length; and
all theſe parts are concealed within the body,
which muſt render them more hot and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
Of all animals the mole is moſt amply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with generative organs, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with their relative ſenſations. It has, beſides,
a delicate ſenſe of touch; a ſkin as ſoft as vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet;
a very fine ear, and ſmall hands, with five
fingers, very different from the extremities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quadrupeds, and nearly ſimilar to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
hand; great ſtrength in proportion to the
ſize of its body; a compact ſkin; and a perpetual
vigour. So lively and reciprocal an attachment
ſubſiſts between the male and female, that they
ſeem to dread or to diſreliſh all other ſociety.
They enjoy the placid habits of repoſe and of
ſolitude, the art of ſecuring themſelves from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
and injury, of inſtantaneouſly making an
aſylum or habitation, of extending its dimenſions,
and of finding a plentiful ſubſiſtence, without the
neceſſity of going abroad. Theſe are the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
the diſpoſitions, and the talents of the mole;
and they are unqueſtionably preferable to talents
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0195500104:381"/>
more brilliant and more incompatible with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
than the moſt profound obſcurity.</p>
               <p>The mole ſhuts up the entrance of her retreat,
and ſeldom leaves it, unleſs compelled by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of water, or when its manſion is demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
by art. She makes a round vault in the
meadows, and generally a long trench in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;
becauſe it is eaſier to remove cultivated
ground, than a turf rendered compact and ſolid
by the roots of herbs. She continues not long
in miry nor in hard ſtony ground, but delights in
a ſoft earth, ſtored with eſculent roots, and well
peopled with inſects and worms, which conſtitute
her chief nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>As the moles ſeldom leave their ſubterranean
abodes, they have few enemies, and eaſily elude
the carnivorous animals. The overflowing of
rivers is their greateſt ſcourge: During inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they are ſeen ſwimming in vaſt numbers, and
uſing every effort to gain the more elevated
grounds; but moſt of them periſh, as well as
their young, who remain in their holes. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this devaſtation, the great talents they have
for multiplying would render them extremely
incommodious to man. They couple about the
end of winter, and go but a ſhort time with young;
for we find them very ſmall in the month of May.
They generally bring forth four or five at a time;
and it is eaſy to diſtinguiſh the hillocks under which
they litter; for they are larger, and made with
more art than the common kind. I believe thoſe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0195500104:382"/>
animals bring forth more than once a year; but
of this I cannot be certain: It is a fact, however,
that we meet with young ones from April to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.
Perhaps ſome of them may be later in
coupling than others.</p>
               <p>The habitation where they depoſit their young
merits a particular deſcription; becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
with ſingular intelligence. They begin
with raiſing the earth, and forming a pretty high
arch. They leave partitions, or a kind of pillars
at certain diſtances, beat and preſs the earth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terweave
it with the roots of plants, and render
it ſo hard and ſolid, that the water cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the vault, on account of its convexity and
firmneſs. They then elevate a little hillock below,
upon the top of which they lay herbs and leaves,
for a bed to their young. In this ſituation, they
are above the level of the ground, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
out of the reach of ordinary inundations,
and are, at the ſame time, defended from the rains
by the large vault that covers the internal one,
upon the convexity of which they reſt, along with
their young. This internal hillock, or vault, is
pierced on all ſides with ſloping holes, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
ſtill lower, and ſerve as ſubterraneous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
for the mother to go in queſt of food
for herſelf and her offspring. Theſe by-paths
are firm and beaten, extend about twelve or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
paces, and iſſue from the manſion like rays
from a centre. We likewiſe find, under the ſuperior
vault, the remains of the roots of the <hi>colchicum,</hi> or
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0195500104:383"/>
meadow ſaffron, which ſeem to be the firſt food
given to the young. From this deſcription it is
apparent, that the mole never comes out but at a
conſiderable diſtance from her habitation, and
that the moſt ſimple and moſt certain method of
taking both the old and the young, is to make a
round trench, which will cut off all the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
paſſages. But, as the mole, upon the
ſmalleſt noiſe, flies, and endeavours to carry off
her young, it will be neceſſary to employ three
or four men with ſpades to raiſe the hillock at
once, or to make a trench almoſt inſtantaneouſly,
and then to ſeize them, or to watch them as they
attempt to eſcape.</p>
               <p>It has been fooliſhly aſſerted by ſome writers<note n="*" place="bottom">Urſus, <hi>Meles,</hi> Erinaceus, <hi>Talpa,</hi> Veſpertilio per hyemem dormiunt abſtemii; <hi>Linn. Faun. Suec. p.</hi> 8.</note>,
that the mole and badger ſleep during the whole
winter, without taking any food. The badger,
as we formerly remarked<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Article Badger.</note>, comes out of his hole
in winter, as well as in ſummer, in queſt of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions;
and it is eaſy to be aſcertained of this fact,
by the tracks he leaves upon the ſnow. The mole
ſleeps ſo little in winter, that ſhe raiſes the earth
in the ſame manner as ſhe does in ſummer; and
the country people remark, that <hi>a thaw approaches,
becauſe the moles make hills.</hi> They are, indeed,
fond of warm places; and they are often caught
by the gardeners in the months of December,
January, and February.</p>

The mole frequents cultivated countries only.
There are none in the dry deſerts, nor in the cold
climates, where the earth is frozen during the

exiſt not in hot climates. Thoſe of America are

               <p>I have here given a figure of a mole found at
the Cape of Good Hope, a ſtuffed ſkin of
which was ſent me by M. Sonnerat. This mole
pretty much reſembles the common ſpecies in the
form of its body, in the eyes, in the ears, and in
the tail; but it differs in the head, which is lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and in the muzzle, which reſembles that of a
Guiney-pig. The fore-feet are likewiſe different:
The hair is not black, but dark brown, with a
little yellow at the extremity of each hair. The
tail is covered with large hairs of a yellowiſh
white colour; and, in general, the hair of this
mole is longer than that of the European. From
all theſe deſcriptions we may conclude, that it is
a particular ſpecies, and that, though allied to the
common mole, it cannot be regarded as a ſimple
variety.</p>

               <head>The PENSYLVANIA MOLE.</head>
               <p>IN Penſylvania, ſays M. Kalm, there is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of mole, which lives principally on roots.
This animal digs, in the fields, ſmall winding ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
alleys. In proportion to its ſize, it
has more ſtrength and rigidity in its paws than
moſt other quadrupeds. In digging the earth, it
uſes its feet like oars. M. Kalm put one of them
into his handkerchief; and he found, that, in
leſs than a minute, it had made a number of ſmall
holes, as if the cloth had been pierced with a bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin.
It was very miſchievous; and, whenever
it found any objects in its way, it immediately
perforated them with its teeth. I preſented to it,
continues M. Kalm, my ink-piece, which was
made of ſteel; it began to bite the ink-piece; but
was ſoon repelled by the hardneſs of the metal,
and never afterwards inclined to bite any thing
that was held out to it. This animal raiſes not
the earth, like the moles of Europe, but only
makes ſmall paths under the ground<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage de Kalm, tom. 2. p. 333.</note>.</p>
               <p>Theſe characters are not ſufficient to give us a
proper knowledge of the animal, nor enable us to
decide whether it belongs to the mole-tribe.</p>

               <p>THOUGH all beings are equally perfect
in themſelves, ſince they proceed from the
hands of the ſame Creator; yet, in relation to
man, ſome beings are more accompliſhed, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſeem to be imperfect or deformed. Of the
former kind are all thoſe whoſe figures appear to
us to be agreeable and complete; becauſe all their
parts and members are proportioned, all their
movements and functions eaſy and natural. The
latter kind of beings, which to us have a hideous
aſpect, comprehends all thoſe whoſe qualities are
noxious to man, whoſe nature is uncommon, and
whoſe form differs from the ordinary figures from
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0195500104:390"/>
which we received our primary ſenſations, and
derived thoſe ideas which ſerve as models to our
judgment. The head of a man upon the neck
of a horſe, and its body covered with feathers,
and terminating in the tail of a fiſh, repreſents a
picture of enormous deformity, for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but becauſe it unites what Nature has placed
at the greateſt diſtance. An animal, like the bat,
which is half a quadruped and half a bird, and
which, upon the whole, is neither the one nor
the other, muſt be a monſtrous being; becauſe,
by uniting the attributes of two oppoſite genera,
it reſembles none of thoſe models preſented to us
in the great claſſes of nature. It is an imperfect
quadruped, and a ſtill more imperfect bird. A
quadruped ſhould have four feet, and a bat ſhould
have feathers and wings. In the bat, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet,
though they ſerve the animal for the double
purpoſe of flying and of trailing its body on the
ground, are neither wings nor feet. They are
deformed extremities, the bones of which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normouſly
lengthened, and united by a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,
which is neither covered with feathers nor
with hair. They are a ſpecies of pinions, or
winged paws, in which we ſee only a claw of
an inch in length; and the other four long toes
muſt act along with the former; for they have
no proper movements or ſeparate functions.
They are a kind of hands ten times larger than
the feet, and four times longer than the body of
the animal. In fine, they are parts which have
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0195500104:391"/>
rather the air of caprice than of a regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.
This membrane covers the arm, forms
the wings or hands of the animal, unites with the
ſkin of the body, and, at the ſame time, ſurrounds
the legs, and even the tail, which, by this bizarre
conjunction, becomes, in ſome meaſure, one of
its toes. To theſe diſcrepancies and diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the body and its members may be added
the deformities of the head, which are often much
greater: For, in ſome ſpecies, the noſe is hardly
viſible, the eyes are ſunk near the ear, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with the cheeks: In others, the ears are
as long as the body, or the face is twiſted into the
form of a horſe-ſhoe, and the noſe turned up like
a cock's comb. All of them have ſmall, obſcure,
covered eyes, a noſe, or rather noſtrils, ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and a mouth extending from ear to ear:
They all likewiſe endeavour to conceal themſelves,
fly the light, inhabit dark places only, from
which they never go out but during the night,
return at break of day, and faſten themſelves
againſt the walls. Their motion in the air is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a deſultory fluttering, than flying, which
they execute very aukwardly. With difficulty
they raiſe themſelves from the earth, and never
fly to any great height: They quicken, relax,
or direct their flight, in a manner the moſt bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and imperfect. Their flight is neither rapid
nor direct, but conſiſts of quick vibrations, in an
oblique and winding direction. They fail not,
however, in paſſing, to ſeize flies, gnats, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0195500104:392"/>
moths, which fly only during the night.
Theſe they ſwallow almoſt entire; and we find,
in their excrements, portions of wings and other
dry and indigeſtible parts of moths. Having one
day deſcended into the caverns of Arcy, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the ſtalactites, I was ſurpriſed to find, in a
place covered with alabaſter, and ſo dark and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,
a kind of earth which was totally differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
It was a thick maſs, ſeveral feet in extent,
of a blackiſh matter, almoſt entirely compoſed of
fragments of the wings and legs of flies and
moths, as if immenſe numbers of theſe inſects
had aſſembled in order to die and corrupt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This, however, was nothing elſe but the
dung of bats, probably amaſſed during many
years in a favourite part of theſe ſubterranean
caverns; for, through the whole of theſe caverns,
which extend above half a quarter of a league, I
ſaw no other collection of this matter; and I i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
that the bats had fixed upon this place
for their common abode; becauſe it was reached
by a glimmering light from an aperture in the
rock, and that they choſe not to go farther, leſt
they ſhould be loſt in a darkneſs too profound.</p>
               <p>Bats are real quadrupeds: Excepting the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of flying, they have nothing in common
with birds. But, as the action of flying implies
great ſtrength in the upper and anterior parts of
the body, the bats have their pectoral muſcles
much ſtronger and more fleſhy than thoſe of
quadrupeds; and in this they have an affinity to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0195500104:393"/>
the birds. They differ from them, however, in
every other part of their ſtructure, both external
and internal: The lungs, the heart, the organs of
generation, and all the other viſcera, are ſimilar to
thoſe of quadrupeds, excepting the penis, which
is pendulous and looſe, a thing peculiar to man,
the monkeys, and the bats. Like the quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds,
the bats are viviparous, and have teeth and
paps. They are ſaid to bring forth but two at a
time, and that they ſuckle their young, and even
carry them when flying. In ſummer they copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
and bring forth; for they are in a torpid
ſtate during winter. Some cover themſelves with
their wings, as with a mantle, and ſuſpend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by the hind feet to the vaults of ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
caverns; others ſtick faſt to old walls, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into holes. Wherever they take up their
winter abode, they always aſſemble in ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
as ſecure them againſt the effects of cold.
They paſs the winter without food or motion,
never awake till the ſpring, and again retire at
the end of autumn. They ſupport hunger bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than cold: Though carnivorous animals, they
can ſubſiſt ſeveral days without food. When
they get into a lardner, they fix upon the ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
meat, and eat fleſh whether raw or roaſted,
freſh or corrupted.</p>
               <p>Only two ſpecies of bats have formerly been
deſcribed as natives of our climate. Beſide theſe,
M. Daubenton has diſcovered other ſix, which
are equally numerous and common; and it is

therefore aſtoniſhing that they ſhould ſo long

perfectly diſtinct, and never aſſociate together.</p>
               <p>The firſt, which is well known, is the common

to the naturaliſts, and is perhaps ſtill more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
than the common bat. The long-eared
bat is much leſs than the common ſpecies; its
wings are likewiſe ſhorter, its muzzle ſmaller
and ſharper, and its ears of an immoderate ſize.</p>
               <p>The third ſpecies, which we ſhall denominate
the <hi>Noctule,</hi> from the Italian word <hi>notula,</hi> was
not known, though very common in France,
and even more frequent than the two preceding
ſpecies. This bat is found under the eaves of
houſes, caſtles, and churches, and alſo in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
of old trees. It is nearly as large as the
common bat. Its ears are broad and ſhort, its
hair reddiſh, and it has a ſharp piercing voice,
like the ſound of a ſmall bell<note n="†" place="bottom">The noctule has the noſe ſlightly bilobated; ears ſmall and rounded; on the chin a minute verruca; hair of a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh aſh-colour; length to the rump two inches eight tenths; tail one inch ſeven tenths; extent of the wings 13 inches; <hi>Pennant's ſynopſ. of quad.</hi> p. 369.</note>.</p>

The fourth ſpecies we ſhall call the <hi>Serotine.</hi>
It is ſmaller than the common bat or noctule, and
nearly of an equal ſize with the long-eared bat.
But it differs from the latter in having ſhort,
pointed ears, blacker wings, and the hair of a
deeper brown.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſerotine has a longiſh noſe, and ſhort ears, but broad at the baſe: The hair on the upper part of the body is brown mixed with ferruginous, and the belly of a paler colour.

               <p>The fifth ſpecies we ſhall name <hi>Pipiſtrelle,</hi>
from the Italian word <hi>pipiſtrello,</hi> which likewiſe
ſignifies a bat. The pipiſtrelle is not near ſo large
as the common bat, the ſerotine, the noctule, ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the long-eared kind. It is the ſmalleſt, and
leaſt ugly of all the bats, though the upper lip is
turgid, the eyes ſmall and deep ſunk, and the
front much covered with hair<note n="†" place="bottom">The pipiſtrelle has a ſmall noſe; the upper lip ſwells out a little on each ſide; the ears are broad, and the forehead covered with long hair: The colour of the upper part of the body is a yellowiſh brown, that of the lower part duſky, and the lips are yellow. It is the leaſt of bats, not one inch and a quarter long to the rump; the extent of the wings, ſix in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and a half; <hi>Pennant's ſynopſ. of quad.</hi> p. 370.</note>.</p>
               <p>The ſixth ſpecies I call <hi>Barbaſtelle,</hi> from the
Italian word <hi>barbaſtello,</hi> which alſo ſignifies a bat.
This animal is nearly of the ſame ſize with the
long-eared ſpecies: Its ears are as broad, but not
near ſo long. The name <hi>barbaſtelle</hi> is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
adapted to it, becauſe it appears to have large
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0195500104:396"/>
whiſkers: This, however, is only an appearance
occaſioned by the turgidneſs of the cheeks, which
form a kind of pudding above the lips. The
muzzle is very ſhort, the noſe much flattened,
and the eyes near the ears<note n="*" place="bottom">The barbaſtelle has a ſunk forehead, long broad ears, the lower part of the inner ſides touching each other, conceal the face and head, when looked at in front; the noſe is ſhort, and the end of it flatted; the cheeks are full; the upper part of the body is of a duſky brown, the lower aſh-coloured and brown: Its length to the rump about two inches, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the wings ten and a half; <hi>Pennant's ſynopſ. of quad.</hi> p. 370.</note>.</p>

<hi>horſe-ſhoe.</hi> The countenance of this animal is
remarkably deformed. The moſt ſtriking fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a membrane in the ſhape of a horſe-ſhoe,
which ſurrounds the noſe and the upper lip. In
France it is very common, and frequents the
walls and vaults of old houſes. Some of them are
larger, and others ſmaller; but they are otherwiſe
ſo ſimilar in form, that we conſider them as of
the ſame ſpecies. But, as I have remarked this
difference, without finding any of an intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
ſize, I cannot determine whether it is an
effect of different ages, or a conſtant variety in
the ſame ſpecies<note n="†" place="bottom">This bat has a membrane at the end of the noſe in form of a horſe-ſhoe; the ears are long, broad at the baſe, and ſharp pointed, inclining backward: It wants the little or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ear.

               <p>WE have three ſpecies of this animal, the
fat ſquirrel, the garden ſquirrel, and the
dormouſe, which, like the marmot, ſleep during
the winter. Of theſe the fat ſquirrel is the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
and the dormouſe the leaſt. Several au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have confounded theſe three ſpecies, though
they are eaſily diſtinguiſhable. The fat ſquirrel
is about the ſize of the common ſquirrel, and has
its tail covered with long hair: The garden ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
is not ſo large as a rat, has very ſhort hair on
its tail, excepting near the extremity, where it
is buſhy: The dormouſe is not larger than the
common mouſe; the hair on its tail is longer
than that of the garden ſquirrel, but ſhorter than
that of the fat ſquirrel, and terminates buſhy.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0195500104:403"/>
The garden ſquirrel differs from the other two,
by having black ſpots near its eyes, and the dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſe
by having whitiſh hair upon its back. All
the three are white or whitiſh on the throat and
belly; but the garden ſquirrel is of a fine white,
the fat ſquirrel only whitiſh, and the dormouſe
rather yellowiſh than white, in all the under
parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals are improperly ſaid to ſleep du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
winter; for it is not a ſtate of natural ſleep,
but a torpor or numbneſs of the ſenſes and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
produced by a chillneſs of the blood. The
internal heat of theſe creatures exceeds not that
of the air. When the heat of the air is ten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
above the freezing point, their temperature
is preciſely the ſame. I have plunged the ball
of a thermometer into the bodies of ſeveral living
garden ſquirrels, and found their internal heat to
be always nearly equal to the temperature of the
air: I have even ſeen the thermometer ſink a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or half a degree when applied to the heart,
the temperature of the air being at that time on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
11°. Now, we know that the heat of man,
and of moſt quadrupeds, is always more than
30 degrees. It is not, therefore, ſurpriſing that
theſe animals, whoſe heat is ſo ſmall, ſhould fall
into a benumbed ſtate, whenever their internal
heat is not augmented by that of the external
air; and this always happens when the thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
exceeds not ten or eleven degrees above
the freezing point. This is the true cauſe of the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0195500104:404"/>
torpid ſtate of what are called the ſleeping ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
a cauſe which, though common to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
that ſleep during winter, has hitherto been
overlooked. I have diſcovered it in the three
animals under conſideration, in the hedge-hogs,
and in the bats; and, though I have never had
an opportunity of examining the marmot, I am
perſuaded that its blood, like that of the other
ſleepers, is cold; becauſe it is ſubject to torpor
during the winter.</p>
               <p>This torpid ſtate continues as long as the cauſe
by which it is produced, and ceaſes with the cold.
A few degrees of heat above ten or eleven is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to re-animate them; and, if kept in a
warm place during the winter, they are never
benumbed, but go about, and eat and ſleep from
time to time, like other animals. When they
feel cold, they roll themſelves up in the form
of a ball, in order to expoſe leſs ſurface to the
air, and to preſerve their natural warmth. It is
in this form that they are found, during the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in hollow trees, and in holes of walls expoſed
to the ſouth. There they lie, without the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
motion, upon moſs and leaves; and, though
toſſed about, they neither extend themſelves, nor
exhibit any ſigns of life. From this ſtate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can rouſe them but the application of a
gentle and gradual heat; for they die when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
brought near a fire. Though, in this ſtate,
they have no motion, though their eyes are ſhut,
and they ſeem to be deprived of every ſenſation;
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0195500104:405"/>
yet they feel pain when it is acute. A wound,
or a burn, makes them contract, and utter a low
cry, which they even repeat ſeveral times: Hence
their internal ſenſibility, as well as the action of
the heart and lungs, ſtill ſubſiſt. It is preſumable,
however, that theſe vital motions act not with
equal force as when the animal is in its ordinary
ſtate. The circulation, it is probable, proceeds
in the large veſſels only; the reſpiration is ſlow
and feeble; the ſecretions are inconſiderable; and
no excrements are voided. There muſt likewiſe
be little or no perſpiration, ſince they paſs ſeveral
months without eating, which could not happen,
if they loſt as much of their ſubſtance by this
means, as they do at other times, when they
have an opportunity of repairing this natural
waſte by taking nouriſhment. They ſtill, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
loſe ſome part; becauſe, in long winters,
they die in their holes. Perhaps, likewiſe, it is
not the duration, but the rigour of the cold that
deſtroys them; for they ſoon die when expoſed
to a ſtrong froſt. What induces me to think that
they periſh not by loſs of ſubſtance, is, that in
autumn they are exceedingly fat, and equally ſo
when they revive in the ſpring. This quantity
of fat ſerves for an internal nouriſhment to the
animal, and ſupplies what it loſes by reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As cold is the only cauſe of their torpor, and
as they fall not into this ſtate but when the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of the air is below ten or eleven degrees,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0195500104:406"/>
they frequently revive during the winter; for, in
this ſeaſon, there are often many days when the
liquor in the thermometer ſtands at 12, 13, 14,
and even higher degrees; and, during fine weather
of this kind, the dormice come out of their holes
in queſt of food, or eat what they had collected
in autumn. Ariſtotle, and all the ſucceeding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts,
have aſſerted, that the dormice paſs the
whole winter without eating, that, in this ſeaſon
of abſtinence, they grow very fat, and that they
are better nouriſhed by ſleep alone, than other
animals by food. This notion is both abſurd and
impoſſible. The dormouſe, who ſleeps four or
five months, could only fatten by the air it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires.
Suppoſing a part of this air to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into nouriſhment, an augmentation ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
could never reſult from it. It would not
even be ſufficient to repair the continual waſte
occaſioned by perſpiration. Ariſtotle might be
led into this error by the mild winters of Greece,
where the dormice ſleep not perpetually, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
revive, take plenty of food, and are, therefore,
extremely fat, though in a torpid ſtate. The
truth is, they are fat at all times, and particularly
in ſummer and autumn. Their fleſh reſembles
that of the Guiney-pig. The Romans reckoned
dormice among their moſt delicate diſhes, and
reared them in great quantities. Varro deſcribes
the method of making warrens for them; and
we learn from Appicius the manner of dreſſing
them in the high taſte of his times. In this
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0195500104:407"/>
practice, whether from a diſguſt at theſe animals,
becauſe they reſemble rats, or from the badneſs
of their fleſh, the Romans have not been follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by other nations. I have been informed by
peaſants who had eat them, that they were not
better than water-rats. Beſides, the fat ſquirrel
is the only ſpecies that is eatable; the fleſh of
the garden ſquirrel is bad, and has a diſagreeable
flavour.</p>
               <p>In manners and diſpoſitions, the fat ſquirrel
greatly reſembles the common ſpecies. It lives
in foreſts, climbs trees, and leaps from branch to
branch, with leſs agility indeed, becauſe the ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
has longer legs, and a body more light and
meagre. They both, however, live upon the
ſame food, namely, filberts, cheſnuts, and wild
fruits. The fat ſquirrel likewiſe eats ſmall
birds, which he takes in their neſts. He makes
not a neſt in the tops of trees, like the ſquirrel;
but he makes a bed of moſs in the hollows of
their trunks, or in the cliffs of rocks; but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
chooſes a dry place. He abhors moiſture,
drinks little, and ſeldom deſcends on the ground.
He differs ſtill more from the ſquirrel in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
that the latter is eaſily tamed, and the
former continues always wild. They couple in
the end of ſpring, and the females bring forth in
ſummer, the litter generally conſiſting of four or
five. The young grow quickly; and we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
that they live only ſix years. In Italy,
where theſe animals are ſtill eat, the natives dig
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0195500104:408"/>
pits in the woods, and ſtrew them with ſtraw,
moſs, and beach-maſt. They chooſe dry places,
under the ſhelter of rocks, and with a ſouth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure.
To theſe the fat ſquirrels reſort in great
numbers, and the people find them there in a
torpid ſtate towards the end of autumn, when
they are in the beſt condition for eating. Theſe
ſmall animals are bold, and defend their young
to the laſt extremity. They bite violently with
their fore-teeth, which are very long, and of
great ſtrength. They neither fear the weaſel nor
ſmall birds of prey. They eſcape from the fox,
becauſe he cannot follow them to the tops of
trees. Their moſt formidable enemies are the
martins and wild cats.</p>
               <p>The fat ſquirrels are not very generally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.
They appear not in very cold climates,
ſuch as thoſe of Lapland and Sweden; at leaſt
they are not mentioned by the northern natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts:
The ſpecies they deſcribe is the dormouſe,
which is the leaſt of the three. Neither, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
are they to be met with in very warm coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
becauſe our travellers are ſilent on this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.
There are few or none in open countries,
like Britain; they require temperate climates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with wood. We find them in Spain,
in France, in Greece, in Italy, in Germany, and
in Switzerland, where they live in the foreſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hills, and not on the tops of high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
like the marmots, who, though ſubject to
torpor from cold, ſeem to delight in froſt and
ſnows.</p>

They alſo climb with eaſe pear, apricot,
and plumb-trees; and, when ſoft fruits are not
to be had, they eat almonds, filberts, nuts, and
even leguminous plants. Of theſe they carry off
great quantities into their retreats which they dig
in the earth, and particularly in well cultivated
gardens; for, in old orchyards, they are often
found in the hollows of old trees, where they
make beds of herbs, moſs, and leaves. Cold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbs
or makes them ſleep, and they are revived
by heat. Eight or ten of them are frequently
found in the ſame place, all benumbed, and rolled

filberts. They copulate in ſpring, and bring
forth in ſummer. The litter conſiſts of five or
ſix young, who grow very quickly; but who
nevertheleſs are not fertile till the following year.
Their fleſh is not eatable, like that of the fat
ſquirrel: They have the ſame diſagreeable odour
with the domeſtic rat; but the fat ſquirrel has
no bad ſmell. They never become ſo fat, and
want thoſe fatty follicles with which the inteſtines

               <p>THE Dormouſe is the leaſt ugly of all the
rats. It has brilliant eyes, and a buſhy
tail, which is rather fair than red. It never lives
in houſes, and ſeldom in gardens; but, like the
fat ſquirrel, frequents the woods, and dwells in
the hollows of old trees. The ſpecies is by no
means ſo numerous as that of the garden ſquirrel.
The dormouſe is always found alone in its hole;
and there is a conſiderabel difficulty in procuring
ſpecimens of them. It appears, however, that
they are pretty frequent in Italy, and that they
exiſt in northern climates; for Linnaeus men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
them, in his liſt of Swediſh animals<note n="†" place="bottom">Faun Suec. p. 11.</note>. But
they ſeem not to inhabit Britain; for Mr Ray<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ray, Synopſ. quad. p. 220.</note>,
who had ſeen them in Italy, ſays, that the <hi>little

is very well deſcribed by Aldrovandus<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovand. hiſt. quad. digit. p. 440.</note>; but he
tells us, that there are two ſpecies in Italy; the
one is rare, and has the ſmell of muſk; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is common, and has no peculiar odour; and
that, at Bologna, they are both called dormice,
becauſe of their reſemblance in figure and ſize.
We know only the ſecond of theſe ſpecies; for
our dormouſe has no ſmell, either good or bad.
Like the garden ſquirrel, it wants the fatty folli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which inveſt the inteſtines of the fat ſquirrel,
never becomes ſo fat, and, though its fleſh has no
diſagreeable odour, it makes not good eating.</p>
               <p>Like the fat and garden ſquirrels, the dormouſe
rolls itſelf up and ſleeps in winter, revives in
mild weather, and amaſſes nuts and dry fruits.
It makes its neſt upon trees, like the common
ſquirrel, but generally lower, between the branches
of hazels, or bruſhwood. The neſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of interwoven herbs, is about ſix inches dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
and is only open above. I have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
by many countrymen, that they have found
theſe neſts in cut woods, and in hedges; that
they are ſurrounded with moſs and leaves; and
that, in each neſt, there were three or four young.
When they grow large, they abandon the neſts,
and harbour in the hollows or under the trunks
of old trees, where they repoſe, amaſs proviſions,
and ſleep during the winter.</p>

               <p>TO this ſpecies of rat, which has only been
known for a few years paſt, I have given
the appellation of <hi>Surmulot.</hi> This animal is
mentioned by no naturaliſt, excepting M. Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who calls it the <hi>wood-rat.</hi> It is larger and
more miſchievous than the common rat. It has
reddiſh hair, a very long naked tail, and the ſpine
of the back arched like that of the ſquirrel. Its
body is likewiſe thicker; and it has whiſkers
like a cat. It is not above nine or ten years ſince
this ſpecies was diffuſed through the environs of
Paris. From whence theſe animals came, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain;
but they have multiplied prodigiouſly.
Neither is this wonderful, when we conſider that
they generally produce from 12 to 15 young at
a litter, and ſometimes even the lenght of 19.
They were firſt diſcovered at Chantilly, Marly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
Ville, and Verſailles, where they committed
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0195500104:416"/>
great ravages. M. le Roy favoured me with
great numbers of them, both living and dead, and
communicated to me the remarks he had made
upon this new ſpecies. The males are larger,
ſtronger, and more miſchievous than the females.
When hard purſued, or when we attempt to ſeize
them, they face about, and bite the ſtick or the
hand that ſtrikes them. Their bite is not only
cruel, but dangerous; for it is inſtantly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a conſiderable ſwelling, and the wound,
though ſmall, is long in healing. The females
bring forth three times a year: Hence two indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
of this ſpecies may produce at leaſt 36
young in 12 months. The mothers prepare a
bed for their offspring. Some of the females ſent
us, whom we kept in cages, were with young;
and, two or three days before they brought forth,
we obſerved that they gnawed the wood of the
cages, and made of the cuttings, which were in
conſiderable quantities, a convenient bed for their
little ones.</p>
               <p>The brown rats have ſome qualities which make
them approach to the nature of the water-rat.
Though every where diffuſed, they ſeem to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the banks of waters. The dogs purſue them
with the ſame remarkable fury as they chace the
water-rat. When purſued, and they find it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eaſy to take to the water, or to conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in bruſh-wood, they chooſe the water, enter
it without fear, and ſwim with great dexterity and
eaſe. This phaenomenon is chiefly exhibited when
they cannot regain their holes; for, like the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed

field-mouſe, they dig ſubterraneous retreats,
or rather they neſtle in thoſe made by the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.
The brown rats may be taken in their
holes by ferrets, who purſue them with equal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
as they do the rabbit.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals paſs the ſummer in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
And, though they feed principally upon
fruits and grain, they eat young hares, partridges,
and fowls: When they enter a hen-houſe, like
the pole-cat, they kill more than they can eat.
Towards the month of November, the mother,
and all the young quit the fields, and come in
troops into the barns, where they do infinite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
by mincing the ſtraw, conſuming the grain,
and infecting every thing with their ordure. The
old males remain in the fields, each inhabiting
his own hole, where, like the field-mice, they
amaſs acorns, beach-maſt, &amp;c. filling the holes to
the top, and remaining themſelves at the bottom.
They ſleep not, like the dormouſe; but go out
in winter, eſpecially when the weather is mild.
Thoſe who take up their abode in barns, baniſh
all the mice and rats. It has even been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that, ſince the multiplication of the brown
rat about Paris, the common rats are much leſs
frequent.</p>

               <p>OF all modern Naturaliſts, Geſner has brought
greateſt advantages to the ſcience. To
great erudition, he has joined good ſenſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
views. Aldrovandus is only the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator
of Geſner, and authors of leſs note have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
copied him. We heſitate not, therefore,
to borrow facts from him with regard to the
Marmots, who are natives of his country, and
concerning whom he was better informed than
us, though, like him, we have kept ſeveral of them
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0195500104:420"/>
in a ſtate of confinement. What he ſays corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponds
ſo exactly with our own obſervations,
that we doubt not the truth of his remarks, when
he retails facts of which we have no knowledge.</p>
               <p>The Marmot, when taken young, may be
rendered nearly as tame as our domeſtic animals.
He learns to ſeize a ſtick, to dance, to perform
various geſticulations, and to obey the voice of
his maſter. Like the cat, he has an antipathy
againſt dogs. When he begins to be familiar in
the houſe, and perceives that he is protected by
his maſter, he attacks and bites dogs of the moſt
formidable kind. Though not ſo large as a hare,
he is ſtouter, and his ſtrength is aided by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
ſuppleneſs and dexterity. With his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth,
which are pretty long, he bites moſt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
He attacks not, however, either dogs or men,
unleſs when he is irritated. If not prevented, he
gnaws furniture and ſtuffs, and, when confined,
even pierces through wood. As his limbs are
ſhort, and his toes faſhioned like thoſe of the
bear, he often ſits on end, and walks with eaſe on
his hind-legs. He carries food to his mouth with
the fore-legs, and eats in the manner of a ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.
He runs pretty quick up hill, but ſlowly
on a plain. He climbs trees, and mounts between
the cliffs of rocks, or two adjoining walls; and
the Savoyards, it is ſaid, learned from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mots
to climb for the purpoſe of ſweeping chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.
They eat every thing preſented to them,
as fleſh, bread, fruit, roots, pot-herbs, may-bugs,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0195500104:421"/>
graſs-hoppers, &amp;c.; but milk and butter they
prefer to every other aliment. Though leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to theft than the cat, they endeavour to
ſlip into the dairy, where they drink great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of milk, making, like the cat, a murmuring
noiſe expreſſive of pleaſure. Beſides, milk is the
only liquor that is agreeable to them; for they
rarely drink water; and they refuſe wine.</p>
               <p>As to figure, the marmot has ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
both to the bear and to the rat. It is not,
however, as Perrault, and ſome others imagined,
the <hi>arctomys</hi> or <hi>bear-rat</hi> of the antients. Its
noſe, lips, and form of the head reſemble thoſe
of the hare; it has the hair and claws of the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the teeth of the beaver, the whiſkers of the
cat, the eyes of the fat ſquirrel, and the legs of
the bear. The tail is ſhort, and the ears termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
abruptly. The hair on the back is of a
reddiſh brown colour, more or leſs deep: This
hair is pretty rude; but that of the belly is red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,
ſoft, and buſhy. Its voice reſembles the
murmuring of a young dog, when careſſed, or in
a ſporting humour. But, when irritated or
frighted, it makes a whiſtling noiſe, ſo loud and
piercing, that it hurts the ear. It loves clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
and retires, like the cat, to void its ordure.
But, like the rat, it has a very ſtrong diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſmell, eſpecially in ſummer. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
fat in autumn: Beſides a large epiploon, it
has two very thick fatty follicles. All the parts
of its body, however, are not equally fat. The
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0195500104:422"/>
back and reins are loaded with firm and ſolid fat,
ſimilar to the fleſh of a cow's udder. Thus the
marmot would make very good eating, if it had
not always a diſagreeble odour, which cannot
be concealed but by very ſtrong ſeaſonings.</p>
               <p>This animal, which delights in the regions of
froſt and ſnow, and which is only found on the
tops of the higheſt mountains, is more ſubject
than any other to be rendered torpid by cold.
In the end of September, or beginning of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
he retires into his hole, from which he comes
not out till the beginning of April. His retreat
is made with precaution, and furniſhed with art.
It is capacious, broader than long, and very deep,
ſo that it can contain ſeveral marmots, without
any danger from the corrupting of the air. With
their feet and claws, which are admirably adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the purpoſe, they dig the earth with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
quickneſs, and throw it behind them. It
is not a hole, or a ſtraight or winding tube, but
a ſpecies of gallery made in the form of a Y,
each branch of which has an aperture, and both
terminate in one, where the animal lodges. As
the whole is made on the declivity of a mountain,
the innermoſt part alone is on a level. Both
branches of the Y are inclined, and the one is uſed
for depoſiting the excrements of the animals, and
the other for their going out and coming in.
The place of their abode is well lined with moſs
and hay, of which they make ample proviſion
during the ſummer. It is even affirmed, that this
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0195500104:423"/>
labour is carried on jointly; that ſome cut the
fineſt herbage, which is collected by others, and
that they alternately ſerve as vehicles for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
it to their dens. One, it is ſaid, lies
down on his back, allows himſelf to be loaded
with hay, extends his limbs, and others trail him
in this manner by the tail, taking care not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſet
him. Theſe repeated frictions are aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the reaſon why the hair is generally rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
off from their backs. But, it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that this effect is produced by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
digging of the earth, which is ſufficient to
peel the hair off their backs. Whatever may be
in this, it is certain, that they dwell together, and
work in common at their habitations, where they
paſs three fourths of their lives. Thither they
retire during rain, or upon the approach of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and never go out but in fine weather, and
even then to no great diſtance. One ſtands ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel
upon a rock, while the others ſport on the
graſs, or are employed in cutting it to make hay.
When the ſentinel perceives a man, an eagle, a
dog, &amp;c. he alarms the reſt by a loud whiſtle,
and is himſelf the laſt to enter the hole.</p>
               <p>They make no proviſions for winter, as if they
divined that they would then have no uſe for
victuals. But, when they perceive the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of the ſleeping ſeaſon, they ſet to work
in ſhutting up the two entrances of their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and this they perform with ſuch labour
and ſolidity, that it is eaſier to dig the earth any
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0195500104:424"/>
where elſe, than in the parts they have fortified.
They are at this time very fat, weighing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
twenty pounds; and they continue to be
plump for three months; but afterwards gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decay, and are extremely emaciated at the
end of winter. When diſcovered in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats,
they are found rolled up in the form of a ball,
covered with hay; and they are carried off in ſo
torpid a ſtate, that they may be killed without
ſeeming to feel pain. The fatteſt are choſen for
eating, and the young ones for taming. Like
the dormice, they are revived by a gradual heat;
and thoſe which are fed in houſes, and kept warm,
never become torpid, but are equally lively and
active in the winter as in the ſummer. As to the
ſleeping of the marmot, we ſhall not repeat what
was ſaid under the article of the fat fquirrel. The
cooling of the blood is the ſole cauſe of this
pheanomenon; and it has been remarked by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
writers, that, in this torpid condition, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
as well as all the ſecretions, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
languid, and that the blood, not being
renewed by freſh acceſſions of chyle, has no ſero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. No. 397.</note>.
Whether they remain conſtantly torpid
for ſeven or eight months, as is alledged by moſt
authors, is uncertain. Their holes are deep, and
they live together in numbers; a conſiderable
heat, therefore, muſt be preſerved for ſome time,
and they may eat the herbage they have amaſſed.
We are even told by M. Altmann, in his treatiſe
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0195500104:425"/>
on the animals of Switzerland, that the hunters
allow the marmots to remain unmoleſted for
three weeks or a month; that they never dig in
ſoft weather, or during a warm wind; that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
theſe precautions, the marmots awaken and
dig ſtill deeper; but that, by opening their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats
during hard froſts only, they find them
ſo torpid as to be carried off with eaſe. We may,
therefore, conclude, that they, in every reſpect,
reſemble the dormice; and that, if they remain
longer torpid, it is becauſe they inhabit a climate
where the winter is longer.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals produce but once a year, and
the litter generally conſiſts of three or four. The
growth of their young is very quick; they live
only nine or ten years; and the ſpecies is neither
numerous nor much diffuſed. The Greeks were
unacquainted with the marmot, or, at leaſt, they
have made no mention of it. Among the Latins,
Pliny is the firſt who takes notice of it, under
the name of <hi>mus Alpinus,</hi> or Alpine rat: And,
indeed, though there are ſeveral ſpecies of rats
in the Alps, none of them is ſo remarkable as the
marmot, or, like it, live in the ſummits of the
higheſt mountains. The other ſpecies confine
themſelves to the vallies, the ſides of the hills,
or firſt mountains. Beſides, the marmot never
deſcends from the heights, but ſeems peculiarly
attached to the chain of the Alps, and to prefer
a ſouth or eaſt expoſure to that of the north or
weſt. He is found, however, in the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0195500104:426"/>
the Pyrenees, and the higheſt mountains
of Germany. The <hi>bobak</hi> of Poland<note n="*" place="bottom">Auctuarium Hiſt. Nat. Poloniae, auct. Rzaczynſki, p. 327.</note>, to which
M. Briſſon<note n="†" place="bottom">Regn. anim. p. 165.</note>, and, after him, Meſſrs Arnault de
Nobleville et Salerne<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt. Nat. des Animaux.</note>, have given the name of
<hi>marmot,</hi> differs from this animal, not only in
colour, but in the number of toes; for it has five
toes on the fore feet. The claw of the great toe
appears beyond the ſkin; and we find within,
the two phalanges of the fifth toe, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
wanting in the marmot. Hence the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bak,</hi>
or Poliſh marmot, the <hi>mouax,</hi> or marmot
of Canada, the <hi>cavia,</hi> or marmot of Bahama,
and the <hi>cricet,</hi> or marmot of Straſburgh, are all
different ſpecies from the Alpine marmot.</p>

                  <p>I have here given the figure of an animal cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Monax,</hi> or <hi>Marmot of Canada.</hi> The deſign
was ſent me by Mr Colinſon, but without any
deſcription. This ſpecies of marmot ſeems to
differ from the other marmots, by its having
only <hi>four</hi> toes on the fore-feet, while the Alpine
marmot and the bobak or Poliſh marmot have
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0195500104:427"/>
                     <hi>five</hi> toes both on the fore and the hind feet.
There is alſo ſome difference in the form of the
head, which is more thinly covered with hair.
The tail of the monax is longer and leſs buſhy
than that of the common marmot; ſo that this
Canada animal may regarded rather as a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
ſpecies than as a ſimple variety of the
Alpine marmot. In this ſpecies, I preſume, the
animal called the <hi>Whiſtler</hi> by Baron Hontan,
may be ranked<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage du Baron de la Honton, tom. 1. p. 95.</note>. He ſays, that it is found in
the northern parts of Canada; that it is nearly
of the ſize of a hare, but ſhorter in the body;
that it is hunted only for its ſkin, which is much
valued; but that its fleſh is not good. He adds,
that the Canadians call theſe animals <hi>Whiſtlers,</hi>
becauſe, in fine weather, they whiſtle at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
to their holes, which he has frequently
heard. Our Alpine marmot makes the ſame
kind of whiſtling noiſe.</p>

               <head>The MARMOT of the Cape of

               <p>WE owe the firſt notices of this animal to
M. Allamand, a learned naturaliſt and
profeſſor at Leyden. M. Pallas has deſcribed it
under the name of <hi>Cavia Capenſis,</hi> and M. Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maer
under that of the <hi>Baſtard African Marmot.</hi>
Both have given a figure of it from the ſame
plate, of which M. Allamand has ſent me a copy.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0195500104:429"/>
In writing on this ſubject to M. Daubenton, he
remarks:</p>
               <p>'I ſend you the figure of a ſpecies of cabiai,
(I know no other name to give it), which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the Cape of Good Hope. It is
not ſo well drawn as I could wiſh; but, as I
have the animal ſtuffed in my cabinet, if you
are inclined, I ſhall tranſmit it to you by the
firſt opportunity.'</p>
               <p>We accepted not this obliging offer of M. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamand,
becauſe we were ſoon after informed,
that one or two of theſe animals had arrived in
Holland alive, and hoped that ſome naturaliſt
would furniſh us with an exact deſcription. Both
Mr Pallas and Voſmaer have accordingly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
this animal, and I ſhall here give extracts
from their remarks.</p>
               <p>"This animal," ſays M. Voſmaer, "is known
at the Cape of Good Hope, under the name of
the <hi>Rock Badger,</hi> probably becauſe it lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
rocks, and under the earth, like the badger;
to which, however, it has no reſemblance. It
has a greater affinity to the marmot, and yet it
differs conſiderably from that animal. . . . . Kolbe is the firſt who mentions this animal, and
he ſays, that it reſembles the marmot more than
the badger."</p>
               <p>We ſhall adopt the name of the <hi>Marmot of the
Cape,</hi> in preference to that of the cavia, becauſe
it differs from the cavia or cabiai in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:
1. In the climate, the cavia being an
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0195500104:430"/>
animal of South America, while the other is found
only in Africa; 2. Becauſe cavia is a Braſilian
word, and ought not to be tranſported into Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
ſince it belongs to the true cavia, and to the
cavia-cobaia, or Guiney-pig; Laſtly, becauſe the
cabiai inhabits only the margins of waters, and
has membranes between its toes; but the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot
of the Cape lives among rocks, and in dry
grounds, which it can dig with its claws.</p>
               <p>"The firſt animal of this ſpecies," ſays M.
Voſmaer, "that appeared in Europe, was ſent
by M. Tulbagh to the Prince of Orange, and its
ſkin is ſtill preſerved in his cabinet. The colour
of the firſt differed greatly from that of another
which arrived afterwards: It was very young
and very ſmall. That which I am about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
was a male, and was ſent me by M. Berg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meyer
of Amſterdam. . . . . The life of this
animal, according to my information, is very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy;
for it ſlept much during the voyage.
Its motion is ſlow, and performed by leaps. But,
perhaps, in a natural ſtate, it is equally active as
the rabbit. Its cries were frequent, but ſhort,
ſharp, and piercing."</p>
               <p>I ſhall obſerve in paſſing, that this character
brings the animal ſtill cloſer to the marmot; for
the Alpine marmots often make a ſharp whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
noiſe.</p>
               <p>"In Holland," continues M. Voſmaer, "they
feed this marmot with bread and different kinds
of pot-herbs. It is probable that this animal
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0195500104:431"/>
brings forth often, and in great numbers. The
form of their feet indicates that they are deſtined
for digging the earth. The preſent marmot ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
died at Amſterdam, I gave it for diſſection
to M. Pallas.</p>
               <p>"In ſtature, it reſembles the common rabbit,
but it is thicker and more collected. The belly
is peculiarly groſs; the eyes are beautiful, and
of an ordinary ſize. The eye-brows, both above
and below, are garniſhed with ſome ſhort black
hairs, above which there are five or ſix hairs of
the ſame colour, but long, that turn back toward
the head. It has ſimilar whiſkers on the upper
lip, about the middle of the muzzle.</p>
               <p>The noſe is black, naked, and divided by a
fine future, which deſcends to the lip. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils
reſemble a cord broke through the middle.
Under the muzzle, on the throat, and the
cheeks, are ſome long, rude, black hairs; and
hairs of the ſame kind are ſcattered over the
whole body. In the palate there are eight deep
furrows; the tongue is very thick, tolerably long,
garniſhed with ſmall papillae, and oval at the
point. In the upper jaw, there are two ſtrong
teeth, which protrude over the under jaw, and
are conſiderably diſtant from each other, having
a kind of triangular appearance. In the under
jaw, it has four cloſe cutting teeth, which are
very broad, long, and flat. The grinders, of
which it has four on each ſide, are alſo large;
and a fifth of a ſmaller ſize may be added to the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0195500104:432"/>
number. Its fore-legs are ſhort, and half cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſkin of the body. The feet are black
and naked. Thoſe before have four toes, the
one in the middle longeſt; and the exterior one
is ſhorter, and ſeems to adhere to the third. The
toes are armed with round ſhort claws, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the ſkin like the human nails. There
are three toes on the hind feet; the middle one
only is furniſhed with a crooked claw, and the
exterior toe is ſhorter than the others. The ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
leaps on its hind legs, like the rabbit. It
has not the ſmalleſt veſtige of a tail. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the hair is gray, or a yellowiſh brown,
nearly like that of a wild rabbit; but it is deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
upon the head and back; and the breaſt and
belly are whitiſh. There is alſo a whitiſh belt
upon the neck and near the ſhoulders. This
belt forms not a collar, but terminates at the top
