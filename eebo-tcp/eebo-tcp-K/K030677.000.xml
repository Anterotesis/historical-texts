            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE ſtory of this piece is taken from the moral and ingenious writings, lately publiſhed, ſtiled THE ADVENTURER, Numbers 72 and 73. But the Drama, which was too much confined in the fable, has been inlarged here, by the addition of four perſons, namely, NARDIC, ABDALLAH, FATIMA, and HAMET. For tho' NARDIC, and ABDALLAH (SANBAD, in the original) are mentioned in the ſtory, they are not introduced into the ſcene.</p>
            <p>Some other alterations have been made in the fable, in order to accommodate the repreſentation to a Britiſh audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: the machinery of genie's has been laid aſide, and the cataſtrophé brought to paſs without the declared inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſuperior agents: the time and place too, have been reſtrained, to preſerve two of the unities. Shakeſpear alone could <hi>call ſpirits from the vaſty deep</hi>; he was himſelf a ſuperior intelligence; could create beings not to be found in nature or fable, could rock ages to ſleep to haſten his events, and <hi>annihilate both time and ſpace,</hi> to bring the hiſtory of a man within the repreſentation of a day.
<q>
                  <l>"Exiſtence ſaw him ſpurn her bounded reign,</l>
                  <l>"And panting time toiled after him in vain."</l>
               </q>
But modern wits are no more able to ſtride in Shakeſpear's buſkin, than modern beaus to ſhoot in Ulyſſes' bow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0146500100:3"/>The moral, profeſſed in the original ſtory, is, <hi>To ſhew the folly of human wiſhes and ſchemes for correcting the moral government of the world</hi>; which ſentiment is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved here in a ſpeech of Amana's.</p>

               <l>But wreſting from the hand of providence</l>
               <l>The means of my eſcape, we both are wretched.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But I confeſs that the reflections which occurred to my mind moſt ſtrongly, on the peruſal of this tale, were a tender and humane reſentment of the miſeries of thoſe nations which are ſubject to deſpotic power, and an exulting ſenſe of the peculiar bleſſings of liberty, that we enjoy in theſe thrice happy kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The contemplation of this contraſt, both ſuggeſted and inſpired the plan of the following writing; in which I have endeavoured to contribute my grateful mite of praiſe to thoſe laws, and to that government, under which our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior advantages are eſtabliſhed, defended, and preſerved; and however the preſumption of this attempt may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, I hope that the faults of the performance may be pardoned, as the firſt eſſay of</p>
