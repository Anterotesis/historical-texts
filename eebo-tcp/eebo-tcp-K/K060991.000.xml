            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Your Proteſtant Diſſenting Subjects have your Sacred
Promiſe of Protection, they behaving themſelves Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
and Peaceably to your Government, and Obedient to
the Laws: And, <hi>Madam,</hi> as they cannot be ſo ignorant
of their own Happineſs under your gentle Government, or
ſo blind to their own Intereſt as to forfeit your Favour by
any breach of their Duty; ſo they cannot doubt of the full
Performance on your Majeſty's part, of all that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
has been graciouſly pleas'd to aſſure them of under the
Sanction of your Royal Word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0025001200:3"/>
The Toleration of their religious Liberty has been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
to them by Law; and your Majeſty has been pleas'd
to add to the Force of that Law your Royal Word, that it
ſhall be inviolably preſerv'd.</p>
            <p>Your Majeſty's Proteſtant Diſſenting Subjects lay at
your Feet the following Relation, with all Humility appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your Royal Judgment, whether both their Toleration
is not herein violently invaded, and your Majeſty's Honour
and ſacred Promiſe at leaſt attempted to be violated in the
illegal arbitrary Methods made uſe of to oppreſs one of
their Miniſters, and ſuppreſs an Aſſembly of ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of your Loyal and Peaceable Diſſenting Subjects.</p>
            <p>They remonſtrate, and in the humbleſt manner Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
to your Majeſty of the Violence and horrid Practices
made uſe of to Defame, Perſecute, Impriſon and Ruin a
Man, whoſe principal viſible Crime is Serving God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Conſcience, and Teaching the ſame to others.
They humbly preſent themſelves at your Royal Feet, as
wounded through the ſides of this injur'd Perſon, and are
your Majeſty's humble Petitioners, that you will be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
pleas'd to teſtifie your Diſlike of the Oppreſſions and
Injuſtice of their Enemies, in ſuch manner as to your great
Wiſdom ſhall ſeem meet.</p>
            <p>In your Majeſty's Favour and Juſtice they hope for
exemplar Animadverſions on theſe unchriſtian Practices,
and have a full Confidence in your Royal Promiſe, that they
ſhall not be abridg'd of nor ill treated for that Liberty,
which being ſettled firſt by the Laws of God and Nature,
and ſince that by the Laws of this Land, is their legal
<pb facs="tcp:0025001200:4"/>
Right, and which your Majeſty's juſt Sence of its Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
has mov'd you to reſolve to maintain.</p>
            <p>They humbly commit themſelves and their Cauſe to your
Majeſty's Protection, imploring your Royal Regard ſo far
and no farther as every Article advanc'd in their behalf
in this Book is poſitively and exactly conformable to Truth
and direct Meaning, being at all times ready to come forth
and confront, even in your Royal Preſence, all the Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Having thus publickly appeal'd to God and your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
they can no longer Doubt either of the Bleſſing from
above, or the Protection and Aſſiſtance of your Majeſty
below: and as your Throne has been a famous Refuge to
appreſt Innocence and Virtue in all Nations, ſo they doubt
not but your own Subjects ſhall yet have the Honour and
Happineſs of your powerful Protection as far as Juſtice
and Law is on their ſide.</p>
            <p>Nor are they the leſs confident of your Majeſty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
for their differing in Judgment from ſome few
Points profeſs'd and practis'd by the Church of <hi>England</hi>
of which your Majeſty is the glorious Head, ſince the
Evils they complain of are ſuffer'd not from the Church
of <hi>England</hi> as ſuch, whom they honour, and with whom
they covet to live in Charity, Union, and Peace, but by
ill Men, who making the Church, Religion, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God their Pretence, have broken all the Laws of
God, Nature, Humanity, and their Native Country, in
a moſt unheard-of and unaccountable manner, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

Scandal of the Church they pretend themſelves Members of.</p>
            <p>Neither your Majeſty nor the Church of <hi>England</hi> will
be offended at us for endeavouring to bring our Actions to
the Teſt of the Law, and for ſeeking the Protection of your
Royal Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Your Majeſty oppreſſes none of your Subjects, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IN the unhappy Differences between the High-Church Party
and the Diſſenters, it has happen'd, as it generally does in
all Heats and Animoſities of Parties, that both Sides pretend
to be in the right, and both pretend to be abus'd by the
other.</p>
            <p>The warm Men of the Church have charg'd the Diſſenters with
Aſſociating to Deſtroy and Undermine the Church. How they
have made good their Charge, is not the buſineſs of this Paper,
and has been examin'd elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters charge the other with Inſulting them, Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, and Invading their Toleration.</p>
            <p>Great Endeavours have been us'd to defend the Occaſional Bills
from a Charge of Perſecution: and whether they have done that
or no, we need not diſpute, but refer to the Conferences on
that Head between the Houſes, and which are publiſh'd in Print.</p>
            <p>But to leave all doubtful Caſes to ſtand and fall by the Force of
their own Truth, I cannot think the World ought to be ignorant
of the following Story; that all unbyaſs'd People may ſee, by
this Specimen, what theſe Gentlemen would do with the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
if it lay in their power, and how juſtly they have been
charg'd with deſigns to Hang, Baniſh, and Deſtroy the Diſſenters,
and reward their Miniſters with the Gallows and the Galleys.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I am going to preſent the World with a new
<hi>Devil of Loudon,</hi> with a Story ſo black in all its Parts, ſo much the
Picture of Hell, and ſo aggravated with inhumane and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Circumſtances, that all that read it muſt bluſh for their Native
Country, to think ſuch unheard-of Villanies could be acted in it,
Crimes ſo abhorr'd by Mankind, that tho' they call themſelves
of the Church, we ſhall find all the true Members of the Church,
whether Judges, Juſtices, Biſhops, yea even Jaylors themſelves,
abhorring it: while, I ſay, I have ſuch a Scene before me, and
knowing what ſort of People I have to do with, I ſhall take ſuch an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0025001200:7"/>
exact care to have every thing that is here advanc'd ſo atteſted with
undeniable Evidence, that Impudence it ſelf, not the helliſh Actors,
not the blindeſt Advocates, not the Devil himſelf, ſhall dare to
Reply to it.</p>
            <p>Slander and Lies fly befoe Truth as Miſt before the Sun;
and this helliſh Aſſociation, form'd againſt an innocent Man, tho'
laid as deep as Hell, and proſecuted thro' all the barbarous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
of Forgery, Perjury, Violence, Subornation, Inſults, and
Revenge, yet at laſt all dwindles away before Truth: Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
breaks out like the Sun thro' a dark Cloud, the Light
of Truth is ſo clear, that Devils ſhun it, Monſters fly from it, and
Men of Guilt and Blood hide their Heads at its appearance.</p>
            <p>And as I ſhould not have attempted this Relation, had I not had
good and undoubted Teſtimony of the Truth of every Article, ſo
I write with the greater Aſſurance, ſince I can frankly defie the
moſt harden'd Advocate of ſuch a wretched Cauſe to confront the
leaſt or minuteſt Circumſtance.</p>
            <p>Such direct Teſtimony, ſuch juſt Authorities, ſuch authentick
Proofs of every Article, are before me, that no Man could ever
deſire to have his Reputation vindicated with more. Clearneſs in
the Face of the Sun.</p>
            <p>As for the Treatment this poor injur'd Man has met with, I
would be glad the worſt Enemy in the Nation would give it a
Name, and tell us, wiht ſome little Reaſon at the ſame time,
what to call it.</p>
            <p>I would have them rummage <hi>Fox</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Popiſh Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
and tell us where they can match the Uſage this Man has
met with; and let us know where ever Biſhop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> or bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Bonner,</hi> acted like Theſe Men.</p>
            <p>Let them ſhew us ſuch an Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrate as Parſon
<hi>Eern,</hi> and where ever Engliſh-men have been thus treated.</p>
            <p>Well might the Parliament paſs a Bill to qualifie Juſtices of the
Peace. If this be the fruit of putting Church Parſons into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
of the Peace, never let <hi>Hudibras</hi> tell us of the Cobler of
<hi>New-England,</hi> who
<q>
                  <l>Serv'd his Country in a double</l>
                  <l>Capacity, to Preach and Cobble.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To let the Reader gradually into this black Story, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to inform him, that in ſeveral publick Printed Books, as well
as in common Diſcourſe, the Town has been poſſeſs'd with a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a Diſſenting Miniſter in the <hi>Iſle of Ely,</hi> who firſt forg'd Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0025001200:8"/>
Orders, and preach'd in the Church; but being detected
in that, pretended Claſſical Ordination, and ſet up a Conventicle;
but being proſecuted as a ſcandalous Fellow, having two or three
Wives, four or five Baſtards, having once broke out of <hi>Derby</hi>
Jayl, play'd a great many villainous Pranks, and being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Drunkard and Swearer, the Juſtices took him up as a Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond,
liſted him for a Soldier, and ſent him away to <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
where having been Arreſted for Debt, and thereby got out of the
Officer's hands: ſome Complaints being made by the Diſſenters at
the Injuſtice of this—The Party greet them, by way of Anſwer,
with prodigious Calumnies, and inſolent Reproaches of the Man
himſelf, to vindicate the moſt villainous unheard-of Proceedings
that ever this Nation knew.</p>
            <p>And as the abominable Inſolence of their Actions happen'd to
receive a due Cenſure from the beſt Lord Chief Juſtice, and
of the moſt unſpotted Character this Age has known; let us
ſee how this Perſon, as well as the poor Sufferer, is treated on
this account by that Man of Fury and Satyr, Mr. <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>Inveighing againſt our Men of Moderation in the Church, he
ſays, <q rend="inline">"Nay, ſo tender are they of their Diſſenting Brethren, that

            </p>
            <p>Now if, upon reading theſe Sheets, it ſhould <hi>ſo fall out,</hi> that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all that has been done or ſaid to or of this poor injur'd Man,
it ſhould appear too plain for the moſt harden'd Lampooner or

and Injuſtice, and, as all the Judges of the Queen's-Bench
expreſt it, the deepeſt Track of Villainy that ever came before
them; What will theſe Men ſay for themſelves, and how will they
make Satisfaction to God or Man, to the affronted Diſſenters, to
their own expos'd Party, and to the poor injur'd Man that has
been inhumanely treated?</p>
            <p>If, after all their Clamour and barbarous Orders, I make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that this Man never broke out of <hi>Derby</hi> or any other Jayl,
never forg'd any Orders, but was fairly ordain'd by a Church of
<hi>England</hi> Biſhop, ws never Perjur'd, or a Vagabond, had never
two Wives at once, nor any Baſtards, was never ſeen to be Drunk,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0025001200:9"/>
or known to Swear; but that, on the contrary, has been always
a ſober, vertuous, and peaceable Liver, a conſtant Reſident at his
Cure for eleven or twelve Years together, a Man of Charity
and good Converſation, and, in ſhort, not in the leaſt guilty of
one of the Crimes charg'd on him, but that it has been all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
Malice, and Conſpiracy to ruin him, meerly for his quitting
the Church, and turning to the Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>If this ſhould happen to be made out, as I fairly undertake it
ſhall, I crave Leave to draw theſe two Inferences;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe Diſſenters who too haſtily believ'd, and too readily
handed on the Clamours and Slanders againſt an innoceut Man,
through whoſe Sides they were all wounded and aim'd it, ought to
acknowledge their want of Conſideration and Caution. 'Tis true,
it may be ſaid, in their Excuſe, they could not have imagin'd the
Earth had borne ſuch Monſters, and that ſuch a Cloud of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
could never be all forg'd; and therefore, in Charity to
the Church-men, they were drawn in to Cenſure an Innocent Man,
for which they ought to ask his Pardon; and reſtoring him to
their juſt Opinion, more diligently guard, for the future, his
injur'd Reputation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Forgers of all this, and the Authors of a Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too foul to relate, and blacker than the Ink I write it
with, I leave their Character to ſeaſon the Pallate of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
after he has been fill'd with Horror at ſome of the moſt
villainous Actions the World ever heard of. The Matter of Fact is
as follows.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="text">
            <head>The CASE of Mr. <hi>ABRAHAM GILL, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>ABraham Gill,</hi> the Subject of the enſuing Tragedy, was a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; He was born in <hi>Rivington</hi> in the
County of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> had his Education partly among the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
but laſt of all in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he
commenc'd Batchelor of Arts of <hi>Brazen-Noſe</hi> College.</p>
            <p>From whence Conforming to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into Holy Orders, and was admitted by the preſent Right.
Reverend the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe his Enemies have had the face to Charge him with
forging the Biſhop's Orders, We think it neceſſary, that we may
clear every thing as we go along, having abundance of dark things
to expoſe and Helliſh Conduct to lay open, to draw this Scene
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0025001200:10"/>
before we proceed, and to tell them, that the very Original Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Signed by the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi>'s own Hand, and Seal'd with
his Seal, is left with the reſt of the Vouchers of this horrid Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
at Mr. <hi>John Skey</hi>'s Tobacconiſt, at the <hi>Black-boy and Three
Tobacco-pipes</hi> at <hi>Queenhithe,</hi> where all the World, Friends or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
are promiſed a free and uninterrupted Opportunity to ſee
them, and detect the Forgeries if they are to be found.</p>
            <p>And that it may not be alledg'd, this Freedom of offering a
ſight of the Originals is but a preſumptive Proof, ſuppoſing no
Man will trouble himſelf to examine them, (<hi>tho' the Willingneſs of
ſome Gentlemen to expoſe the Diſſenters in this honeſt Man's Cauſe
ſuggeſts otherwiſe</hi>) yet eternally to ſtop the Mouth of the moſt
prepoſſeſs'd Malice, a Reverend Clergy-man of their own Church
is to be found, honeſt enough to do Juſtice to an injur'd Man,
and give a Sanction to the Truth.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman is one who entred into Orders with Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi>
and five Miniſters more at the ſame time, and has honeſtly ſworn
it: which Affidavit is left alſo with the reſt of the Vouchers at the
Place aforeſaid. And now if theſe Orders are Counterfeit or
Forg'd, it may fairly be ſeen, and Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> be expos'd; but if
not, let the World match the villainous Uſage this poor Man has
met with, if they can.</p>
            <p>After this Demonſtration of the Certainty and undoubted Truth
of his Orders, 'tis humbly deſir'd of all thoſe Gentlemen that
ſhall for the future charge him with forging Epiſcopal Orders,
that they would be pleas'd to ſhew their Faces, that we may
ſee if they do not bluſh; and that they would tell us their Names,
that after ſome few Examples of this ſort made for Satisfaction to
Juſtice and the Law out of the great Number of thoſe that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
detected, they may be recorded, as they deſerve, among
thoſe that <hi>bear falſe Witneſs againſt their Neighbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed to the Hiſtory of Mr. <hi>Gill:</hi> After he had thus
enter'd into Orders, he preach'd as Curate at <hi>Maney</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of
Ely,</hi> about 12 Miles from <hi>Wisbich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he Officiated in this Place, he was well receiv'd and
belov'd of his Congregation; and we never find any Complaint
made of him, ſave that he ſet an ill Example to his Neighbours
of the Clergy, by invading the Cuſtom of the Country, and
Preaching twice a day to the People.</p>
            <p>Having been two Years in <hi>Maney,</hi> he received an Invitation
from the Inhabitants of <hi>Welney,</hi> or <hi>Welneth,</hi> a Hamlet in the Pariſh
of <hi>Upwell</hi> in the ſame County, to preach in a certain Privileg'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0025001200:11"/>
Independent Chapel in this Pariſh; the Right of the Place em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering
the Inhabitants to chooſe their own Miniſter.</p>
            <p>After long and earneſt Sollicitations from the Inhabitants of
<hi>Wilney,</hi> and with the Conſent of his former Hearers, he agreed
to go to <hi>Wilney,</hi> and accordingly went and ſettled with his Family
in the Parſonage-houſe or Tenement belonging to the ſaid Chapel.</p>
            <p>The Freedom with which the Inhabitants of <hi>Wilney</hi> invited
Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> to be their Curate, appear'd in their chearful aſſiſting
him in his Removal thither, and preparing a Feaſt for his Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
all the Neighbours in general meeting him to bid him
Welcome.</p>
            <p>About a Fortnight or Three-weeks after his Settlement at <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
the Reverend Dr. <hi>Gregg,</hi> Rector of <hi>Upwell,</hi> came to pay him
a Viſit, thank'd him for coming to the ſaid Chapel, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he was glad his Pariſhioners were like to be ſo well ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>In this Chapel Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> continued about ſeven Years, <hi>viz.</hi> from
the Year 1695 to the Year 1702, Preaching twice a day, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
in all things to the Uſage of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But
in proceſs of Time being diſſatisfied in his Conſcience at the Uſe of
the Liturgy, he began at ſeveral times to omit ſuch part of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
as he diſlik'd; till at laſt his Scruples encreaſing, he wholly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Common Prayer, applying himſelf only to the Pulpit,
and conceiving he was not under equal Obligation as if Preaching
in a Pariſh-Church, the Chapel he preach'd in being wholly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent,
a Privileg'd Place, and in the Power of the People.</p>
            <p>As this was the Original of all the ſubſequent Malice of the
Church-Clergy, and of the barbarous Proceedings of which we
are to give an Account; ſo they are hereby fairly challeng'd to
produce one Shadow of a Crime in his Behaviour, which, Humane
Frailty excepted, appears wholly blameleſs, and which we ſhall
produce ſuch Teſtimonials to juſtifie, as few of the Clergy of
the Church can produce more, and ſuch as indeed no honeſt
Man need deſire better.</p>
            <p>If this Offence were as great as they would ſuppoſe it to be,
it yet admits of much to be ſaid in Extenuation; as, I. His
Scruples of Conſcience, which would not permit him to continue
the Exerciſe of the Common Prayer and Ceremonies, at leaſt
not in all parts; 2. His officiating in a private Independent Chapel,
in which, as before, he thought himſelf not oblig'd to an exact
and compleat Conformity.</p>
            <p>But, to oblige our Adverſary, we'll ſuppoſe it as heinous a
Crime as they can pretend to, yet they will have enough to do
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0025001200:12"/>
to make it out that their Proceedings with him have been legal, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
juſt, or humane: And for the Truth of this Suggeſtion,
we refer to the Particulars, and freely make all unprejudic'd
Members of their own Church the Judges: this Independency of
the Chapel of <hi>Wilney</hi> will in ſome meaſure appear as follows.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Gregg,</hi> the Rector of <hi>Upwell,</hi> underſtanding that Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>
omitted the Common Prayer, came to him, and told him, he was
ſorry he (Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>) did not hold to his Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that
he muſt therefore diſpoſſeſs him, and put in another Curate.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> replied, He was not, nor ever had been, his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and that it was not in his (Dr. <hi>Gregg</hi>'s) Power to diſpoſſeſs
him; and therewith Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> ſhew'd the Doctor <hi>his Authority for
holding</hi> the Place, which ſatisfied Dr. <hi>Gregg,</hi> ſo that he never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him the leaſt Diſturbance afterward.</p>
            <p>After ſome time Dr. <hi>Gregg</hi> died, and the Rectory of <hi>Upwell</hi> was
given to one Mr. <hi>Hubbart</hi>; but he being a weakly Man, and in
a deep Conſumption, he put in a Curate to Officiate; <hi>viz.</hi> one
Mr. <hi>Hugh James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>James</hi> finding his Pariſhioners flocking after Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi>
and but few caring to hear him, he expreſt his Diſpleaſure fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in threatning and malicious Speeches againſt Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>; but
the Incumbent Mr. <hi>Hubbart</hi> being a pious and peaceable Man,
would not permit him to moleſt Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> during his Life: but this
was not long; for, in about a Year and a half the ſaid Mr. <hi>Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart,</hi>
the Rector of <hi>Upwell,</hi> died, and the Living was then given
to the ſaid Curate, Mr. <hi>Hugh James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this Mr. <hi>James</hi> was a Man both of a different Temper and
Character from his two honeſt Predeceſſors, he reſolv'd to ſtrain
his Authority to the utmoſt, in order to diſpoſſeſs Mr. <hi>Gill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Step he took in this Undertaking, was that about the <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>
He comes to <hi>Wilney</hi> on a Lord's-day, and
demands the Pulpit for the morning: Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> quietly permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to Preach; which he did, or rather Rail, at an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
rate, againſt Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> bending his whole Diſcourſe to ſet
out the heinous Sin of Omitting the holy Ceremonies, and telling
Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> from the Pulpit, that he ought to lie at the Chapel-door
for three or four Months in Sackcloth, not daring to tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Conſecrated Ground, begging the People to pray to
God for him to forgive him that Sin: and to prove this, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as we are told, ſeveral Popiſh Writers, but not one Text
of Scripture as can be remembred; running on in ſuch a virulent
Stile and unſuitable manner, that many of the Inhabitants could
not bear to hear him, but went out of the Chapel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0025001200:13"/>
In the Afternoon there was no Sermon; for the ſaid Mr.
<hi>James,</hi> Rector of <hi>Upwell,</hi> gave notice to the People to meet him
after Dinner at an Alehouſe, where he Treated them with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
and, as a place more proper for the Subject, preach'd the
Second Part to his Morning Sermon, and beſtow'd another plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſtorm of ill Language on Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> deſiring the Inhabitants to
ſet their Hands to a Letter, Petition, or Paper written to the
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> in order to get Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> turn'd out: But they all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
refus'd him.</p>
            <p>Being diſappointed in his Expectations, and having ſpent his
Breath, as well as Ale, to no purpoſe, he went, as is reported,
that very Night to <hi>Ely,</hi> and the next Week to <hi>London,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
againſt Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Norwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Wilney</hi> having diſcovered the Deſign, and
being very loth to part with their Miniſter, importun'd Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>
to draw up a Petition to the Lord <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in order to
prevent Mr. <hi>James</hi> from obtaining his malicious Deſign.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> at the Deſire of his Congregation, did draw up the
ſaid Petition, which was Sign'd by near 80 Hands of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Wilney,</hi> and ſent up to the Lord <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> (by
the Poſt) who receiv'd it, as is ſuppoſed, before the ſaid Mr.
<hi>James</hi> got thither.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Arrival of the Petition, the Rector Mr. <hi>James</hi>
came up to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and makes his Complaint againſt Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi>
deſiring he might be diſmiſt: but his Lordſhip (as Mr. <hi>James</hi>
himſelf has reported) anſwer'd, That he had heard a very good
Report of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> from his Neighbourhood, That by the
Right of the Place the Choice of a Miniſter was in the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
and they teſtifying to his Behaviour, he could not diſmiſs
him, or credit the Accuſation of one Man againſt the unanimous
Voice of the whole Town, or Words to that effect. But, in
ſhort, he rejected the Requeſt of Mr. <hi>James,</hi> and refus'd to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or Diſpoſſeſs Mr. <hi>Gill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>James</hi> finding himſelf diſappointed here, applies himſelf to
the Spiritual Court at <hi>Norwich,</hi> and about <hi>May</hi> 1702 procures a
Citation againſt Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> to appear at <hi>Norwich.</hi> Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> obey'd
the Citation very readily, appear'd at <hi>Norwich,</hi> and retain'd one
Mr. <hi>Batchelour</hi> as his Proctor to manage his Defence.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>James</hi> finding himſelf ſtill defeated, and not venturing to
proceed in the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Court at <hi>Norwich,</hi> let drop his Citation,
and ceas'd his Proſecution till about <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1702, when he ſerv'd

While this was depending, Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> going to <hi>Cambridge</hi> to Vote

Knight, who pretending Friendſhip to Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> and his
Neighbours who were there preſent, began to perſwade them
to part quietly and lovingly; and to avoid continual Fewds,
perſwaded Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> to quit the Chapel of <hi>Wilney,</hi> as a Place not
worth ſo much Fewd and Conteſt; and upon his doing ſo, he
promis'd <hi>he would engage on the behalf of Mr. James,</hi> the Suit in the
Spiritual Court ſhould go no farther.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> conſented, and tho' much againſt the minds of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,

where, for want of his appearing, and <hi>that worthy Knight break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> having thus quitted his Charge, had a Call from <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
to a Diſſenting Congregation; which Call, after ſome time,
he accepted, and accordingly remov'd to go thither. And here
'tis neceſſary to advertiſe the Reader; that Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was ſo far

was near ten Weeks reſolving, removing, and ſettling his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> has been inform'd, this black piece of Malice had its
birth in <hi>Jeſus College</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> concerted there between
Dr. <hi>Cook,</hi> Dr. <hi>James,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lateward,</hi> and their Confederates; but
as he is not poſitive in that, he ſhall be glad of an Occaſion to ask
their Pardon for the Suggeſtion when they ſhall have purg'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
honourably from the Suſpicion; and till then, thinks the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0025001200:16"/>
Grounds he has for his Opinion are ſufficient to clear him of any
breach of Charity in believing it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was with his Family upon the Road from <hi>Wilney</hi> into
<hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> when this Publication was firſt made; and coming
to <hi>Boſton</hi> on a Thankſgiving-Day, he reſted, and went to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Meeting to hear the Sermon; when, after Sermon, Mr.
<hi>Keeling</hi> the Miniſter took him home to his Houſe, and ſhew'd him
the <hi>Gazette</hi> with the aforeſaid Advertiſement in it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> ſurpriz'd at the Reading of this <hi>Gazette,</hi> as he well
might, immediately took Horſe, leaving his Family in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and
reſolv'd to go to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he expected to find out the
bottom of the matter.</p>
            <p>In this place it will be neceſſary to leave Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> a while, and
the Reader may ſuppoſe him Travelling to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> with a Heart
full of Trouble to ſee himſelf perſecuted with ſo much Malice, and
in hopes to find out his Enemies and their Deſign. And while he
is on the Road, let us enquire upon what ſorry and ſandy Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all this Fabrick of Malice and Folly was erected, which will at
laſt tend to leſſen the Wonder at the Authors being confounded in
their own Devices.</p>
            <p>There had been a Man in <hi>Derby</hi> Jayl whoſe Name was <hi>Gill</hi> (<hi>but,
to avoid all poſſible Cavil, 'tis noted his Name was not</hi> ABRAHAM
GILL, <hi>but</hi> Stephen Clifford <hi>alias</hi> Gill. This Man having been
Committed for Forging Holy Orders, and Counterfeiting the
Coins, and Convicted of both, had broke out of the County Jayl
at <hi>Derby,</hi> and was fled from Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>James,</hi> the Rector of <hi>Upwell,</hi> having been inform'd of this
by his Attorney, immediately fixes it upon Mr. <hi>Gill, and he must
be the Man:</hi> And to bring this Plot to a Head, takes the pains, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>June</hi> 1702, to ſend to <hi>Derby,</hi> and informing the Jaylor there
that his Priſoner was found, procures two Men to be ſent from <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
to ſeize him, and ſo ſure was he of his Game, that he openly gave
it out that Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> had broke out of Jayl, and he ſhould be hang'd.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, the two Men ſent by the Jaylor came over to
<hi>Wilney,</hi> and pretending extraordinary Buſineſs with Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> ſent
for him to an Ale-houſe in <hi>Wilney.</hi> Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> went boldly, as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,
to them; and as they were Strangers, and had pretended
Buſineſs, he wonder'd they diſcours'd with him of ſeveral Things,
treated him courteouſly, paid the Reckoning, but never ſpoke a
a word of any Buſineſs to him, only frequently whiſper'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and left him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0025001200:17"/>
The Truth of this after came out, and Mr. <hi>Brookhouſe</hi> Jaylor
of <hi>Derby</hi> diſcovered the whole Affair to Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> how and on what
Pretence the two Men were procur'd to be ſent from <hi>Derby,</hi> whoſe
Buſineſs with him was <hi>to have apprehended him</hi>; but the reaſon of
their leaving him as they did, was, becauſe they found <hi>he was not
that Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Diſcovery Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> came to know that Mr. <hi>James</hi>'s Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant
in this new Plot was one <hi>Thomas Johnſon</hi> an Attorney of <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
a Man of ill Fame and foul Practice, who poſitively affirm'd
to the two Men that came from <hi>Derby,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was the ſame
Man that broke out of <hi>Derby</hi> Jayl.</p>
            <p>This Deluſion might in ſome meaſure have pleaded in Excuſe of
Mr. <hi>James,</hi> if his next Scene had not put him out of the reach of
any rational Shelter or Defence; for, not content with this Defeat,
he joyn'd with this infamous Attorney and one <hi>Tho. Beart,</hi> who
ſince died in a moſt horrible manner, rotting away above ground.
Theſe three went to one <hi>John Marriot</hi> of <hi>Upwell,</hi> and offer'd to give
him 10 Pounds, or to Guineas, if he would ſwear that Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>
was the ſame Man that had broke out of <hi>Derby</hi> Jayl for Forgery and
Counterfeiting.</p>
            <p>But here they were defeated again, and Heaven, the only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of Innocence, ſo blinded their Underſtanding, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
made an ill Choice of their Inſtruments. Honeſt <hi>John Marriot</hi>
told them plainly, he knew Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was not the ſame Man; and
ask'd them with what face they could deſire him to burthen his
Conſcience with a falſe Oath, or fell his Soul for 10 Guinea's?</p>
            <p>By this time the Reader is to ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
where having been above 14 Days, and all that while walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
publickly about the Streets, and openly enquiring about the
Notice in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> he receiv'd a Meſſage from the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
of <hi>Cambridge</hi> to come to him to <hi>Jeſus College</hi>; whither, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
and aſſur'd of his own Innocence, he freely went.</p>
            <p>Coming to the College, Dr. <hi>Cook</hi> demanded his Name, which
Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> readily told him, and the Place of his laſt Reſidence and
Preaching; <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Wilney.</hi> Dr. <hi>Cook</hi> told him that he was deſcrib'd
in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> and upon the Advertiſement therein he muſt ſend
him to Jayl; which he accordingly did on the 24th of <hi>March</hi> to the
<hi>Tolhooth</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> by a <hi>Mittimus</hi> in the following Words, or
to that effect:<q>

            <p>Thus, without any Proof that he was the Man mention'd in the
<hi>Gazette,</hi> without any Oath, or any Crime alledg'd, Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was
Committed to Priſon by the worthy Dr. <hi>Cook</hi>; of which 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
he may hear again in a different manner than this.</p>
            <p>Nor was the ſending him to Priſon the End of their Malice, but
as ſoon as he came thither he had heavy Irons laid upon him, and
was fetter'd like a Fellon or a Highway-man.</p>
            <p>At the General Quarter-Seſſions Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> being call'd, and Dr.
<hi>Cook</hi> ſitting on the Bench, the Dr. told him, Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> they had
nothing to charge him with: He told them, Then they had done
him a great deal of Wrong to keep him in Cuſtody ſo long, and
treat him ſo hardly, and loading him with Irons: And as they had
now nothing againſt him, he hoped they never would; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pray'd they would Diſcharge him.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, they remanded him to Priſon. Dr. <hi>Cook</hi>
alledg'd he had a Letter from Mr. <hi>James,</hi> Rector of <hi>Upwell,</hi> full of
Crimes againſt Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>; in which Letter, it ſeems, he deſir'd
Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> might be kept cloſe Priſoner till the next Quarter Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>In
Obedience to this Command of Mr. <hi>James,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cook</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to keep Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> in Priſon: but the Barbarity of this
Treatment appearing ſo exceeding great, and the Action ſo foul
that the Country began to talk of it, ſome Gentlemen of the Country
having ſpoken of it to Dr. <hi>Cook</hi>'s Diſadvantage, which coming to
his Ears, he was at laſt prevail'd upon to accept of Bail for Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi>
two eminent Freeholders of that Conuty of 80 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> each of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to be his Bail.</p>
            <p>The Bail being ſuch as could not be objected againſt, <hi>The
Dr. let him go,</hi> binding his Bail in 60 <hi>l.</hi> each, and himſelf in 120 <hi>l.</hi>
to appear at the Quarter-Seſſions.</p>
            <p>This Uſage of Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> with the Fury and Barbarity of their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and Rector, had ſo wrought upon the Inhabitants of <hi>Upwell,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the known Innocence of their Miniſter, that it fill'd
them with juſt Prejudices, and they unanimouſly invited Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>
to come and Preach to them as a Congregation Diſſenting from the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0025001200:19"/>
Church; which he did, duly Licencing the Place in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon's
Court at <hi>Norwich,</hi> and duly Qualifying himſelf according
to Law.</p>
            <p>From whence the Author of theſe Sheets humbly obſerves, and
recommends it to the Conſideration of the Clergy of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> Whether ſuch unjuſt and cruel Treatment of their
Fellow-Chriſtians, Neighbours and Brethren, is the Way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the People in their Adherence to the Church of <hi>England</hi>; or
whether they do not rather Wound the Church, drive their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners
from her, fill them with Prejudices, and encreaſe the
Number of the Diſſenters in this Nation.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> being thus ſettled among his old People, and knowing
that he was to appear at the Quarter Seſſions, where he had good
reaſon to expect all the foul Uſage his Enemies wer capable
of, and where he ſaw their Power was but too great, was adviſed
to remove it by <hi>Certiorari</hi> to the <hi>Queens-bench</hi>; which he did
accordingly, the <hi>Certiorari</hi> being allow'd in Court, and the Fees
of it paid by Mr. <hi>Gill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>James,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> the Curate hearing of this
<hi>Certiorari,</hi> they, or one of them, went to <hi>Cambridge</hi> at the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize;
and applying themſelves to my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt</hi> by
the means of Dr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Dr. <hi>James,</hi> they procur'd a <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>
to remove Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> to <hi>Norwich</hi> Jayl, pretending they could
prove Matter of Fact againſt him there.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he was Committed to <hi>Norwich</hi> Jayl for Felony,
Forgery, Treſpaſs, Contempt, and other high Crimes and Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours.</p>
            <p>Here
the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> lay till the Aſſizes; and ſtill his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
being able to bring nothing againſt him, he mov'd, by his
Conncil, to be Diſcharg'd, and was Diſcharg'd accordingly, by
Order of the Court; which Order is there to be ſeen upon
Record.</p>
            <p>Here he was credibly inform'd Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi>
ſtriving by ſome other Machinations and Conſpiracies to have
continued Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> in Jayl to the next Aſſizes, receiv'd a ſevere
Reprimand from the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> for their unjuſt and
inhumane Treatment of Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>; and that his Lordſhip threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them with Suſpenſion upon that account.</p>
            <p>Alſo that Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> the Regiſter of the Spiritual Court at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
being enquir'd of concerning his Name being put into the
Advertiſement in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> as, that he would give a Reward
for the Apprehending Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>; declared it was done without his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0025001200:20"/>
Privity or Conſent, and that it was a meer genuine Forgery; that
he knew nothing of it, but that it was as ſtrange and ſurprizing to
find his Name there, as it could be to Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> to ſee his there.</p>
            <p>Thus being return'd to his People, Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi>
whom henceforward, in Charity to them, I ſhall conceal under
the Title of the Conſpirators, theratned him, that if he preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
yet to Preach there, he ſhould be ſent to Priſon again:
But he continuing to do his Duty, it remains to examine how
punctual they were to their Words with him.</p>
            <p>About the 13th of <hi>April</hi> 1704, one <hi>Thomas Pitchford,</hi> Conſtable
of <hi>Wilney,</hi> ſerv'd a Warrant on Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> under the Hand of <hi>Tho.
Edwards</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Juſtice of the Peace for the <hi>Iſle of Ely</hi>; the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
requiring the ſaid Conſtable to bring Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> before him
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the 20th of the ſame Month at <hi>Wisbich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſtable having ſerv'd his Warrant, took Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s
Word for his Appearing; but Mr. <hi>Lateward,</hi> one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,
came in a great Paſſion, and railing at the Conſtable,
told him he muſt keep Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> cloſe Priſoner till his Appearnce,
for that then he ſhould certainly go to Jayl; and if he went away
from him, he <hi>the Conſtable</hi> ſhould go to Jayl in his room, and more
ill Language to the like effect: however, the Conſtable ſtill took
Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s Word for his Appearance.</p>
            <p>On the 20th of <hi>April,</hi> being a Seſſions, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
according to his Promiſe, at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> where was preſent
7 or 8 Juſtices, ſeveral Gentlemen, ſome Clergy men, and the
Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>L<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> one of <hi>the Conſpirators,</hi> call'd the Conſtable to bring
up <hi>Gill</hi> his Priſoner: upon which Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> readily appear'd. The
<hi>Conſpirators</hi> immediately told their Tale, and giving Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> baſe
and ſcurrilous Language, according to their particular Talent,
which abounds that way, they inform'd the Juſtices that Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>
bred great Diſturbances in the Pariſh by a Conventicle, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles
did all <hi>England</hi> over. <hi>Which, by the way, might be the
only Truth they ſpoke:</hi> for it ſeems by theſe very Words he bred no
more Diſturbance with his Conventicle than other Miniſters did
with theirs; <hi>ergo,</hi> they ſhould be all ſerv'd ſo. <hi>Shortest Way for
that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> one of the Juſtices, taking up the Cauſe, told
Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> he was inform'd he kept an unlawful Aſſembly or Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
at <hi>Upwell,</hi> and gave him a great deal of rough and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Language.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0025001200:21"/>
Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> with Calmneſs and Reſpect replied, He own'd he kept
a Meeting for Religious Worſhip at <hi>Upwell</hi> in the County of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
but, that it was no unlawful Aſſembly; for the Place was
Licenſed according to Law, and he had qualified himſelf as the
Law Directs: and therefore hoped he did not deſerve to receive
ſuch Abuſe in that place.</p>
            <p>The Juſtice then Demanded to ſee the Licence by which the
ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> held the Meeting; which he producing, both the
<hi>Conſpirators</hi> ſaid in open Court it was Forged: and whether the
Court believed them or no, is uncertain, or what other reaſon
they had for it will be enquir'd in another place, but they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
made a <hi>Mittimus</hi> and Committed Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> to the Jayl in
<hi>Wisbich</hi>—for Forging a Licence, and Preaching in a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.
And taking the Licence from him, they refus'd to reſtore
it him.</p>
            <p>They demanded indeed Bail, but gave him no leave to find it,
refuſing to let him ſtir out of the place: But Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Detriment to his Cauſe allow all their Pretenſions of Bail for
his Behaviour, ſince the Treatment he had received from them was
ſuch, as he might be ſure whoever he had brought to be his
Bail ſhould be brought into equal Trouble; and for that Reaſon
he reſolv'd to embroil none of his Friends.</p>
            <p>And being ſenſible of no Crime for which he ought by the
Law to be bound to his Behaviour, he was advis'd not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any Bail, and refer it to the Law ſtill to decide whether—it
could be juſtly demanded.</p>
            <p>The Wiſdom as well as Juſtice of theſe Magiſtrates is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
alſo here, that they ſhould know no better than to
Commit a Man in the <hi>Iſle of Ely</hi> for a Fact pretended to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the County of <hi>Norfolk</hi>; all which will help to their
Conſolation when they ſhall come to anſwer for it before a
Court and Judges that underſtand the Law.</p>
            <p>And as I undertook at firſt to prove every thing as I went along,
the following Affidavit is an undoubted Teſtimony of the Truth
of this laſt part of the Tragedy; <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with Forgery, which they could not pretend to prove,
and their treating him with baſe ſcurrilous Language, tho' all of
them are pleas'd to deny it upon Oath.<q>

Her Majeſty's Juſtices of the Peace at <hi>Wisbich</hi> in the

Complaint of Mr. <hi>Hugh James</hi> Rector of <hi>Upwell</hi> aforeſaid;
and that at that time there was one Mr. <hi>Lateward,</hi> Curate

that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> commanded the Conſtable (who

kept an unlawful Conventicle. And Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> to juſtifie the
keeping of a lawful Meeting for Worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> produced his
Licence; whereupon the ſaid Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi>
affirmed, That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> had forged the Licence, and

upon this way of Complaint, Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was committed to the

That the ſaid Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> have

And this Deponent verily believes, that the ſaid Mr.

<hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> against Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> was becauſe
Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> Preached twice every Lord's-day, and they but
once; and Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was more diligent in his Miniſtry, and
more charitable to the Poor, and better approved of in his
Place than they the ſaid Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi>
are. And this Deponent farther ſaith, That Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> hath
been a Freeholder in the ſaid Pariſh for ſeveral Years till
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0025001200:23"/>
about the 29th of <hi>September</hi> 1702, and that <hi>James Holms</hi>
of <hi>Welney</hi> (ſince deceaſed) held in Farm under Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>
for ſeveral Years, a parcel of Land of Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s Freehold of
the yearly Rent of 4 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> or thereabouts; and that Mr.
<hi>Gill</hi> had other Lands beſides, and lived in good Fame and
Plenty amongst his Neighbours; and he the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>
is greatly beloved in the whole Pariſh by all but a few that dare
not diſpleaſe the ſaid Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward.</hi>

            <p>In this Condition Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> remain'd a cloſe Priſoner without Bail
till the General Quarter-Seſſions, which was about five Days;
when, he expected to be call'd and lawfully charg'd with ſome
matter of Miſdemeanour, or elſe to be diſcharg'd.</p>
            <p>But now the Plot was ripe for Execution, and at the Quarter-Seſſions
he was omitted, and never call'd at all.</p>
            <p>The Aſſizes follow'd in two Days more, <hi>viz. April</hi> 26. 1704.
when he deſign'd to move for his Diſcharge, not doubting but he
ſhould find Juſtice there, as he had before at <hi>Norwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Deſign was calculated <hi>to diſappoint him here too,</hi> and now
the black Scene opened; for on the ſaid 26th of <hi>April,</hi> being the
firſt Day of the Aſſizes, the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> had procur'd two Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in Concert with themſelves, to come to <hi>Wisbich, tho' above</hi> 20
<hi>Miles out of their own Diviſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Names of theſe worthy Gentlemen are, (<hi>for they deſerve to

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Clerk;
for this Gentleman is both Clergyman and Magiſtrate, of whom we
ſhall ſay no more, till Juſtice thinks fit to take Cogniſance of them,
and treat them as they deſerve.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen, who now made up the number of the <hi>Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators</hi>
to be four, brought with them one Captain <hi>Marſhal,</hi> an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
in Colonel <hi>Lutteril</hi>'s Regiment of <hi>Marines,</hi> in order to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
Liſt, and Carry away this innocent Man as a Souldier, by
Virtue of the Law for Liſting Vagabonds.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral Officers in the Town who wou'd have been
very willing to have rais'd Men, and who ſtay'd there for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
but the Country had rung too loud of the Injury done this
poor Man, ſo that no Officer that knew the Circumſtance, could be
imagin'd <hi>Villain enough</hi> to confederate; but this Gentleman having
the Word of a Juſtice of Peace, and <hi>a Man of God made a Magiſtrate,</hi>
might the more eaſily be impoſed upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0025001200:24"/>
Upon the Arrival of theſe Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was ſent for
out of Priſon to the Sign of the <hi>Bell</hi> in <hi>Wisbich.</hi> All the <hi>Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators</hi>
being preſent, the Church Juſtice began with him in baſe and
villainous Language, as unbecoming his Commiſſion as his Gown,
calling him <hi>Diſturber of the Country,</hi> and <hi>Sawcy Fellow</hi> for anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for himſelf; told him he was <hi>a Drunkard, a Swearer,</hi> and a
great deal to the ſame purpoſe; that he rais'd a Conventicle in
Mr. <hi>James</hi>'s Pariſh, Impair'd the Congregation at the Church,
which was a thing of bad Conſequence, and <hi>ought to be ſupprest</hi>;
and that he was not fit to live in the Country, but to Serve
Her Majeſty, and that therefore he ſhould go for a Souldier.</p>
            <p>This Juſtice <hi>Fern,</hi> being juſtly aſham'd of this Treatment, is

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who at firſt vigorouſly oppos'd theſe Gentlemen; told
them he found Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> had a Licence, and he verily believ'd it was
a good one; that if he (Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>) was guilty of any Crimes, he ought
to be Tryed for them; and, that now was a good time to do
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0025001200:25"/>
it in, the Judges being in Town, and the Aſſizes begun, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
them to conſider if their Authority extended to Preſſing
him for a Souldier.</p>
            <p>This wholſome Advice (<hi>which they may have leiſure to repent they
did not accept of</hi>) they over-rul'd: They flew into ſome Heat at
Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s arguing for him, and told him, tho' they were not
in their own Diviſion, yet they were Juſtices there as well as he,
and expected that they had a Power to act all over the Iſle; and
if they had any Power they would try it, for <hi>the ſaid</hi> Gill <hi>ſhould
be Imprest,</hi> and ſent for a Souldier, and they would anſwer it—At
which Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> was over-ruled, and joyn'd with them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> told them, That beſides his Profeſſion, which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
exempted him from ſuch an Inſult as that, he had two
Qualifications expreſly excepted in the Act, and which legally
forbid them what they now purpos'd to do—Firſt, That he
was <hi>a Freeholder of England</hi>; and Secondly, That he was <hi>a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of a Corporation</hi>; both which were expreſly nam'd in the Act
of Parliament, as Qualifications excepted.</p>
            <p>Juſtice <hi>Bellamy</hi> urg'd again, That theſe were material Objections,
and ask'd him, Where he was a Freeholder, and for How much?
He told them he was a Freeholder to the Value of 10 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi>
Land of Inheritance in the County of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> where he was
born, and a Freeman of the Corporation of <hi>Wigan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> urg'd again, that he ſhould be remanded to Priſon
till they could ſend to the Place to be inform'd—. But the Plot
was otherwiſe laid, and they reſolv'd he ſhould go; ſo they
call'd Captain <hi>Marſhal,</hi> and order'd him to give him 20 S. which
Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> refus'd: then they order'd his Name to be entred in a
Certificate for Impreſt Men, and the Juſtices Sign'd it, and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
him over to the Capt. and Mr. <hi>Fern</hi> in particular call'd to
the Souldiers, and bid them tear his Band off, and take him along
with them, and uſe him <hi>Severely,</hi> (<hi>in ſo many Words.</hi>) Which
Command the Souldiers took care to execute; for they carried
him into a large Room crowded with Preſt Men, where he had
nothing but Straw to lie on. And in this Poſture and Place he
remain'd, ſitting up in his Cloaths and Boots for ſix or ſeven days,
and then was oblig'd to march on foot in his Boots, Riding-Coat,
<hi>&amp;C.</hi> to <hi>Downham</hi> 12 Miles, and from thence to <hi>Ely</hi> 16, and thence
to <hi>Cambridge</hi> 10 or 12.</p>
            <p>For the Proof of this Matter, and how cunningly and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
theſe Men acted, ſome to get out of the Room, and avoid
ſigning the Certificate of his Impreſſing, and others to ſink and

The <hi>Conſpirators</hi> appear'd at the <hi>Queen's Bench</hi> Court in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and mov'd for Time, and ſeveral Motions being made alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
in order to bring in Affidavits; at laſt they found themſelves
ſo preſs'd by the Courſe of the Law, that they were obliged to have
Recourſe to their old ſtock of Villany they had work'd upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and form'd a ſecond Conſpiracy to bring Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Court; the detecting whereof will conclude this part
of our Hiſtory: and the future Rewards Juſtice will beſtow upon
them for theſe things, are reſerv'd to their proper Seaſon; and
may ſerve for a Second Part of this Account.</p>
            <p>After ſeven Weeks Impriſonment at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> having
made up matters with his Creditor was releas'd, and went home to
his Family at <hi>Welney,</hi> ſhowing himſelf publickly, and Preaching
every Week to his Congregation as uſual; for now the <hi>Conſpirators</hi>
ſaw he was out of their power, and whatever they did they muſt
expect to account for.</p>
            <p>At laſt they mov'd the Court that Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> might appear in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to accuſe them, which was granted, and appointed to be on
the 4th of <hi>July</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s Attorney ſent him Notice of this Order, and he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
went for <hi>London</hi>; and ſetting out on the 3d of <hi>July,</hi> in order
to his appearing in the Court, with one Mr. <hi>Tokelove</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
he was arreſted on the Road about 6 Miles from his own
Houſe, by one <hi>Betts</hi> a Bailiff, in an Iſland Warrant, at the Suit of
one <hi>John Smith</hi> of <hi>Downham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Betts</hi> the Bailiff holding him to Bail, carry'd Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> to <hi>Maypole,</hi>
a little Village, 10 Miles from his own Houſe, Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
ſurpriz'd at this Arreſt, knowing the Conſequence of
his Diſappointment, perſwaded the Bayliff to go back with him,
5 Miles to <hi>Maney,</hi> where he got ſome Friends to be his Bail.</p>
            <p>This ended the Trifle of the Arreſt; but the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> End
was anſwered by it; for by that time Bail was given it was After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
and there was no poſſibility of Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s being in Court
at the time appointed, which was the next Morning, being not
able to ride all night, nor to ride ſo hard as to reach to <hi>London</hi>
time enough, (ſending Mr. <hi>Tokelove,</hi> who was then with him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to make Oath of what had paſs'd, which he
did accordingly, as will appear by his Affidavit) being above 60
Miles, <hi>ſo he went back to his own Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court reſented his Default, and the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> took Care
to have it improv'd to his Diſadvantage: But before we come to
relate the Conſequences of the Contempt in Court, 'tis proper to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0025001200:30"/>

            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Betts</hi> the Bayliff firſt arreſted Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> he told him, That

ſerve at <hi>Welney</hi> Chappel as Curate to Dr. <hi>Gragge,</hi> or to

Power to elect their Miniſter. And this Deponent farther

Years in <hi>Welney,</hi> and lived in good Fame and Plenty all the
time of two pious and ſober Rectors of the ſaid Pariſh; and
was well approved of both for Doctrine, Charity, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.
And this Deponent farther ſaith, That ſince Mr.
<hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> have been ſo malicious againſt
Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> he is elected and choſen a Preacher to a Diſſenting
Congregation of Proteſtants in <hi>Upwell</hi> aforeſaid; and is able
in Doctrine religious, and of ſober Life and Converſation,

<hi>James</hi> our preſent Rector at <hi>Upwell,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi>
his Curate (as this Deponent very believes) envying the ſaid
Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> and maliciouſly deſigning to ruin him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0025001200:33"/>
hath ſcandalouſly, maliciouſly, and without Cauſe,
ſpread abroad evil, unjuſt, and undeſerving Characters of
the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> which, by Strangers and Perſons remote
and Ill-wiſhers to the Diſſenting Party, may perhaps be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as coming from ſuch Authors; and this Deponent farther
ſaith, That it is his Opinion that by inſinuating Speeches and
Threatnings the ſaid Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> have
cauſed the Clerk, one <hi>Thomas Fewlis</hi> (who is a looſe, idle,
and wicked Perſon) to ſwear contrary to his Knowledge, and
to the Truth, and that only for fear of loſing his Clerk's Place
and their Favour; and this Deponent the rather believes this,
becauſe he hath heard the ſaid <hi>Fewlis</hi> commend the ſaid Mr.
<hi>Gill,</hi> and ſet forth a quite contrary-Character of him. And
this Deponent farther ſaith, That the ſaid Mr. <hi>James</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> have given Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> very unjuſt Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which hath reduc'd him to Poverty, Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> having been
impriſoned at their Complaint in ſeveral Goals, (<hi>viz.</hi>) at
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1702, and <hi>Aprill, May, June,</hi>
and <hi>July</hi> 1704, and removed to <hi>Norwich</hi> Goal, and kept
Priſoner all the Aſſize Week, till diſcharged the laſt Day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law; and believes that he was entered in the
Goaler's Calender <hi>July</hi> 1703: And after their Threatning
to impriſon him again if he preſumed to ſerve and preach to
our Congregation any more, they have this laſt <hi>April</hi> perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and impriſoned the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> and (without ſhewing
Cauſe of the Impriſonment, or giving any Proſecution at
Seſſions or Aſſizes, which was at the ſame time of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
at <hi>Wisbech</hi>) they cauſed him to be Impreſt out of
Goal for a Soldier, without Liberty to make any Defence,
when at the ſame time he was our Miniſter, and well appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of, and highly beloved, having (as he may have ſtill) a
very plentiful Allowance for his Maintenance, that way of
Preaching (as this Deponent doth apprehend) being a lawful
Employment for a Maintenance; and his Congregation is
large, conſiſting of Gentlemen, and very ſubſtantial Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
as well as Farmers: So that by the way of Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not only Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> but alſo this Deponent, and all the
ſaid Congregntion are Sufferers; and in truth Mr. <hi>James</hi> did
not only threaten and proſecute Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> and procured him
ſent to Goal, and impreſt for a Soldier, as aforeſaid, but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
ſent to the Meeting-place (though qualified according
to Law) and threatned ſome of the Congregation, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0025001200:34"/>
him this Deponent; and apprehended five ſeveral Men
by a Warrant from Mr. <hi>Upwood,</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace,
and carried them like Felons before the ſaid Mr. <hi>Upwood</hi>;
which Perſons (although Mr. <hi>James</hi> is pleaſed to ſwear they
were idle Perſons) yet ſome were very ſubſtantial Freeholders,
and the reſt ſubſtantial Farmers, and very honeſt Men: And
altho' Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> pretend no Malice in
their Proſecution, yet it is a real Truth they have highly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
both Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> and his Congregation, and conſtantly preach
railing Sermons, as this Deponent hath heard and believes;
and they are reputed very malitious and troubleſome Men in
the Pariſh, having excommunicated ſeveral Men, and totally
ruined one Mr. <hi>Whitworth,</hi> our School-Maſter; and in
carrying on that malicious Deſign againſt him, both Mr. <hi>James</hi>
and his Curate did ſwear falſly againſt him at <hi>Swaffam</hi> Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as one of the Grand Jury hath declared and affirmed;
and proſecuted the ſaid Mr. <hi>Whitworth,</hi> till they baniſhed
him the Town, cauſing him to be impreſt for a Soldier, as
they did Mr. <hi>Gill.</hi> And this Deponent ſaith, That it is
credibly affirmed by one <hi>John Marriot,</hi> that they would have
had him to have ſworn, That our Miniſter Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was one
Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> a Miniſter who eſcaped out of <hi>Darby</hi> Goal about
ſix Years ſince, being convict for forging of Holy Orders, and
counterfeiting the King's Coin; (altho' Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> had been
in this Country about us nine or ten Years) but the ſaid <hi>John
Marriot</hi> refuſed to go contrary to his Conſcience. And this
Deponent farther ſaith, That Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was never reported to
be a Swearer or Drunkard, as is alledged in their Affidavits;
and he verily believes he was never once ſeen to be drunk, nor
heard to ſwear one Oath ſince he came into our Country: And
this Deponent is very poſitive that neither Mr. <hi>James</hi> nor any
that made Affidavits at preſent againſt Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi> have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Acquaintance or perſonal Knowledge of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill,</hi>
excepting <hi>Nicholas Scott, Tho. Beart,</hi> and <hi>Tho. Fewlis</hi>;
which ſaid <hi>Thomas Fewlis</hi> is overawed to ſwear to carry
on and vindicate their unjuſt Proſecution, as this Deponent
believes; and this Deponent verily believes he would for a
Reward ſwear twice as much on Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s Behalf, if requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And this Deponent farther ſaith, That Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was
coming the Morning towards <hi>London,</hi> being the third Day

the ſame Pariſh; and did in that Barn, on the Sabbath-day,
preach to ſome Perſons of no great Credit: Upon which this

procured a Warrant from the ſaid Mr. <hi>Upton,</hi> to bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him <hi>Richard Tokelove,</hi> and four other idle Perſons,

his ill Life and illegal Practices. And this Deponent farther
ſaith, That he did not move to have him ſent to Goal, nor did
he affirm that his Licence was forged, but only that there was
great Suſpicion of the ſame, it being only a blank Certificate of
a Licence without date, and that it was not Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s

granted a Warrant to bring the ſaid <hi>Abraham Gill</hi> before this

and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> his Curate, and ſeveral others. And
the ſaid Mr. <hi>James,</hi> amongst other Crimes, accuſed the ſaid
<hi>Gill</hi> of living very lewdly and wickedly with a Woman whom
he kept when his former Wife was living, and had Children by
the ſaid Woman when his former Wife was living, and that it
was highly probable he was not then married to her; as alſo
of his ſetting up a Conventicle at <hi>Welney</hi> without any lawful

Authority that the ſaid Mr. <hi>James</hi> could find out or hear of;

And the ſaid <hi>Abraham Gill</hi> offering little or nothing in his

a very infamous Character and Reputation on divers accounts;
this Deponent, with the other Juſtices then preſent, required
him the ſaid <hi>Abraham Gill</hi> to give Sureties for his good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,

he not being able to do, although most of his ſubſtantial Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

Sealed his <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and ſent him to God till he ſhould

That he did not hear of any ſcurrilous or ill Language which

received of him, being under the Character of cohabiting with

by them both; and of being a drunken and debauch'd Man:

            <p>And 'tis fairly offer'd to Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who we believe has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
drawn into this Snare, That if but any one of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Articles can be prov'd by him, Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> will ceaſe giving
him any Trouble on account of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>'Tis very hard Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> on the bare Recommendation of any
Man, tho' never ſo great, ſhould allege ſuch black Things as
theſe upon an innocent Man, and neither he nor his Authors
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0025001200:52"/>
be able to make out one Clauſe of it: from which we wiſh him
a good Deliverance, and leave that part to the Iſſue of the Law.</p>
            <p>Indeed we have two hard-mouth'd Fellows that ſwear heartily;
but theſe diſcover ſo little Wit with their Good-will, that the
eaſineſs of proving them Perjur'd will be as much a Scandal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Senſes as their Honeſty; we mean Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Fowlis</hi> Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s Clark.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we ſhall begin with this ſwearing Curate, whoſe
Oath is, That Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> owns a Child by the Name of <hi>Abraham Gill</hi>
which is elder than a Child he had by his firſt Wife.</p>
            <p>No Man but Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> would ha' been caught in ſuch a <hi>Fool-Trap,</hi>
and have ſworn what is ſo exceeding eaſie to be detected, the
Children being to be produc'd, and their Ages prov'd.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis plain and known to all the Neighbourhood, and a
thing in which 'tis impoſſible the Truth can be conceal'd, that Mr.
<hi>Gill</hi>'s firſt Wife has been dead upwards of ſeven Years, and the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Child he has by his preſent Wife is but five Years and half old,
or thereabout.</p>
            <p>The neceſſary Proof of this is omitted here, not that it is not the
moſt eaſie of all this Affair to make out, but becauſe it being to
come before a Court of Juſtice as matter of Evidence, 'tis referr'd
to the genuine Proof of fact, and the Iſſue on a Tryal, when Mr.
<hi>Lateward</hi> will do well to produce this little <hi>Abraham in nubibus,</hi> and
prove his Age, and the Time of the Death of the firſt Wife, and
Marriage of the ſecond, and ſee how he can make theſe things out.</p>
            <p>As to the Clerk's Affidavit, he has frequently own'd in Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s
hearing ſince, that he was drunk when he made it, and that he knew
not what was in it, and that if he had known there had been any
ſuch thing in it, he would not have offer'd to ha' ſworn it.</p>
            <p>'Tis a moſt unaccountable thing, that Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> ſhould ſo far
expoſe himſelf in his Affidavit, when the Children are all alive,
born in the ſame Place, their Age regiſter'd in the Pariſh-book,
and ſo many living Witneſſes of the Time of their Birth; and
we bluſh for him to think, if he is not hardned beyond the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Father of Lyes himſelf, what Confuſion he muſt be in, when he
ſhall be ask'd to produce this Child of Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> that muſt be above
nine Years old, or to name where it was Born, when Regiſtred,
or any Circumſtances of the matter.</p>
            <p>So much is Malice frequently forſaken of its Sence, that the
juſt regard Providence always ſhews to Injur'd Innocence, is the
Safety of all honeſt Men, cauſing the Subtilty of wicked falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
to abandon them, and their Folly as well as Wickedneſs to go
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0025001200:53"/>
hand in hand, that Sin and Shame might come together, and their
falſe Accuſation carry its Detection in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>If theſe Gentlemen have any farther Defence to make, any
more Affidavits to bring into Court, the Editor of this promiſes
them to give them their full and free place in the ſecond part of this
Hiſtory; but humbly deſires them, whether Clergy-men or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
that, for the Honour and Dignity of their Offices and
Character, and the Juſtification of their Underſtandings, that
they would either more nicely adhere to the Matter of Fact, or
more politickly conceal the vicious part, that they may not expoſe
themſelves, and force their humble Servants to detect them, to
avoid the Scandal of Blindneſs and Stupidity: that they would
leave Trifling, Circling, and going Round-about Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
with <hi>Suppoſes,</hi> we <hi>have Heard,</hi> and we <hi>are Inform'd,</hi> and
Says that <hi>he is inform'd,</hi> and the like; but, that they would rather
tell us plainly, and make it out, When he was Drunk, or Swore,
or Broke Jayl, or Forg'd Orders, or Liv'd Scandalouſly; for
certainly, Gentlemen, theſe things ought to be made out, or elſe
to ſuggeſt them is a moſt barbarous Treatment, and a Slander that
redounds to the Infamy of the Contrivers.</p>
            <p>AND now we come to preſent the World with the Account
Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> gives of himſelf, not from his own Mouth, but
from the Mouth of numerous Throngs of Neighbours, Inhabitants,
and Perſons both knowing his Character and willing to do Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And firſt, to obviate the Scandal of his having Forg'd the Hand

<hi>Cambridge,</hi> Gent. maketh Oath, That <hi>Abraham Gill</hi> of <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
in the Iſle and County aforeſaid, is a Preacher to a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Proteſtant Diſſenting Subjects in <hi>Upwell</hi> in the County
of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> hath been a Preacher in
and about <hi>Welney</hi> aforeſaid for ſeveral Years last past, and that
he is now, and all the time hath been, well approved of for a
Teacher, and very charitable to the Poor, and hath lived well in
Fame and Plenty amongst his Neighbours. But this Deponent
farther ſaith, That he believes Mr. <hi>James</hi> Rector of <hi>Upwell,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Lateward</hi> Curate at <hi>Welney,</hi> have maliciouſly deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ruin the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> and his Family, conſiſting of a
Wife and four ſmall Children, for they have been very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> for near two Years, having cauſed
him to ſpend very much Money in defending himſelf from their
unjust and malicious Proſecution; ſo that they have now redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to Poverty, and at last would force him away for a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
from his Congregation, where he is beloved, and may have
very good Maintenance. And this Deponent farther ſaith, He
was with Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the Months of <hi>March,</hi>
                              <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> in 1703, where Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was a long time
kept Priſoner at the Complaint of Mr. <hi>James,</hi> without any Cauſe
ſhewed at all: and at the Request of Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> and ſeveral of his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0025001200:58"/>
good Friends, he this Deponent and one Mr. <hi>Thomas Neale</hi>
Bailed Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> out of Jayl, Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> being bound in 120l.
and this Deponent and Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> in 60l. each of them: and
Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> appeared the next Seſſions then after; and as there had
been no Cauſe of his Impriſonment before, ſo nothing appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him ſtill, as the Court declared; but they removed him
to <hi>Norwich</hi> Aſſizes from thence, where this Deponent hath
heard and believes, that upon Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s ſtaying all the time of
Aſſizes <hi>July</hi> laſt, and nothing could be brought againſt him, he
was diſcharged by my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt</hi> and my Lord
Baron <hi>Smith,</hi> or one of them. And this Deponent believes,
that Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> never gave any Cauſe of Offence to Mr. <hi>James</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Lateward,</hi> except it was by being more charitable to the
Poor, and more diligent, and better beloved and approved in his
Place than they are.</p>

And this Deponent farther ſaith, That about the latter end of

Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was Impreſſed and ſent away for a Soldier, to the great

               </gap>, Gentlemen, to go farther with our Adverſaries than
they can expect we ſhould—what if we ſhould ſuppoſe for once
that this <hi>Abraham Gill</hi> was this immoral Man they ſpeak of, if he was
ſuch a refin'd Cheat as to have Deluded all the <hi>Many, many honest
People</hi> who have Sworn to his Character, for who knows how far
the Wit and Subtilty of Man, under the Agency of a hardned
Mind, may furniſh a Man; and what Miſts the Devil may have
laid before the Eyes of Mankind, that this Man ſhould be a Common
Drunkard and Swearer, and Cohabiter with two Women at once,
and a Congregation of ſeveral Hundreds of his Hearers where he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0025001200:62"/>
liv'd all the time know nothing of it, nor his Enemies be able to
produce one Affidavit of any Man that ever ſaw him Drunk, or
heard him Swear.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe theſe ſtrange things come to paſs, for the World
is full of ſtrange things, what can be Inferr'd from hence to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the Treatment he has receiv'd, and all the Diſſenters through
his Intereſt?</p>
            <p>But on this premis'd Suppoſition I crave leave to draw a few Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
which ſhall ſerve to the Cloſe of this Work.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the Forgeries, all the Swearings, Drunkenneſſes, and
Lewdneſs they pretend to charge upon him, are antecedent to his
being a Diſſenter; and we do not find he receiv'd the leaſt Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
in the Execution of his Function on account of theſe known
Immoralities, and might to this day have kept his two Women
and his Cure of Souls both together, as too many of his Brethren
have done before him, and are like to do after him, for any great
Care we ſee taken to prevent it, had he but continued to read the
Common Prayer.</p>
            <p>I forbear to diſcant upon this unhappy Truth; and of the many
known Inſtances of an immoral Clergy, ſhall repeat none, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cover the Infirmities of our Guides, that the Obligation, if
poſſible, may move them both to reform, and to hide thoſe of
their Neighbours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Were all the Immoralities he is charg'd with True, they are
not comparable to thoſe committed in his Proſecution: the Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Subornations, Cruelties, Injuſtice, and illegal Proceedings,
are intolerable. This is Caſting out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince
of Devils: This is the Devil turn'd Reformer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What's all this to going for a Soldier? If every Clergy-man
muſt be Liſted that will be Drunk, if Swearing an Oath will pull a
Man's Band off and ſend him to the Army, if every Clergy-man
that keeps a Woman more than he ſhould do muſt go into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<hi>Lord have mercy</hi> and <hi>a Croſs</hi> ought to be ſet upon the Doors
of a great many Church-Tenements, and perhaps we need not
have ſo many ſevere Acts of Parliament for raiſing Recruits.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, upon the whole matter, we are not ſo concern'd
to Vindicate Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s Character, ſince were he all they could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
it does not in the leaſt palliate or excuſe their Dealings with
him, nor will it be any Extenuation of their illegal Practices when
it comes to be Examin'd before a Court of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore enough: Let them rummage Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>'s Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
to the bottom, let them confute the many Affidavits we have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0025001200:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
produced, perſwade the World to believe him an ill Man, a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,
a Swearer, a Whoremaſter, or any thing, we humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it is all againſt them ſtill; for they do not Perſecute him as an
Immoral Man, if they had, why did they not do it long before?
for it muſt have been known then: but they Perſecute him as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter,
a Diſturber of the Neighbours with a Conventicle, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Welney Chapel</hi> without Reading the Common Prayer: theſe
were the Crimes. All his Vices, if they were true, (<hi>which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
we do not grant</hi>) were committed while he was <hi>Mr.</hi> Gill
<hi>the Curate,</hi> not ſince he was <hi>Mr.</hi> Gill <hi>the Diſſenter.</hi> He was <hi>Their
Mr.</hi> Gill when they ſay he kept an ill Woman: he is unaccus'd of
the leaſt Immorality ſince he was <hi>Our Mr.</hi> Gill. What will they
ſay to this part of it? This makes it a peculiar Pique at a Party, a
Puſh made at the Diſſenters, a Sally of the Method call'd <hi>The ſhorteſt
way,</hi> ſending our Miniſters <hi>a Colonelling,</hi> Voting them a ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that do not live by a lawful Calling, and can give no good
Account of themſelves; and therefore, in the Eye of the Law,
are Vagabonds, and may all be Liſted for Soldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have therefore nothing more to ſay for Mr. <hi>Gill</hi>; we need
not undertake the Vindication of his Morals, we have the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
where he was Born, and Married his firſt Wife; we have
the Inhabitants of <hi>Maney,</hi> and of <hi>Upwell</hi>; All theſe Sign to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and the People Swear that he is ſuch a Man as they deſire to
be their Miniſter. If his Morals are bad, the Morals of the
People ſhould be queſtion'd that deſire a Common Drunkard and
Swearer to be their Miniſter. We leave the reſt of the Caſe
therefore upon them: if he is an ill Man, they will, no doubt,
make the Diſcovery, and diſmiſs him, in Vindication of their own
Character; if not, but he continues to be their Miniſter, and they
deſire he ſhould be ſo, 'tis a better Teſtimony of his Character than
ſome Hundreds of the Vicious Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> can
produce, whoſe Hearers and Pariſhioners would turn them out for
their Debaucheries, if they knew how: And of this I do not
deſire to be forc'd to enter into the Particulars.</p>
