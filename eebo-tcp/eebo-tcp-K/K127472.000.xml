            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE SURGEONS <hi>of</hi> London.</head>
            <p>THE Barbers of the City of <hi>London</hi> were incorporated by King <hi>Edward</hi> the IVth,
<note place="margin">1 Edw. IV. 1461.</note> in order to promote and improve the Science and Faculty of Surgery, upon Conſideration of the many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miſchiefs which had ariſen from the Ignorance and Unſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Perſons practiſing that Art.</p>
            <p>To remedy ſuch Evils for the Time to come, which the Charter recites to have been owing to the Want of a proper Overſight, Correction, and Puniſhment of ſuch as were not ſufficiently ſkilled in the Faculty of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, the Myſtery and Commonalty of Barbers were created a Body Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, with Power to make proper Statutes and Ordinances for their good Government.</p>
            <p>And the Maſters and Governors of that Company were to have the Overſight, Correction, and Government of all Perſons uſing the Myſtery of Surgeons, within the City of <hi>London,</hi> and Suburbs thereof; and the Puniſhment of them, for their Offences, in improperly exerciſing and practiſing their Art; and likewiſe the Overſight and Inſpection of all Inſtruments, Plaiſters, and other Medicines, by them uſed.</p>
            <p>And, in order to attain the End of their Inſtitution, no Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever were to be admitted or received into their Company, except Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſufficiently ſkilled and inſtructed in the Art of Surgery.</p>
            <p>This Charter was afterwards confirmed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth, in the 15th Year of his Reign, and by King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth, in the 2d Year of his Reign.</p>
            <p>In the 32d Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth, when Perſons of better Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and greater Abilities, began to apply themſelves to the Study and Practice of Surgery, the Legiſlature thought proper to unite this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which were ſtill all Surgeons, and, by the Terms of their Charter, could be compoſed of no other Perſons, with another Body of Men, likewiſe practiſing Surgery, but not incorporated.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0724300100:2"/>
            <p>The Act recites, That there then were, within the City of <hi>London,</hi> Two ſeveral and diſtinct Companies of Surgeons, occupying and exerciſing the Science and Faculty of Surgery; the one Company called <hi>The Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of</hi> London, the other called <hi>The Surgeons of</hi> London.</p>
            <p>And the End propoſed by the Legiſlature in uniting theſe Two diſtinct Companies of Surgeons, and making them One Body Corporate, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be, That, by their Union and frequent Aſſembly together, the good and due Order, Exerciſe, and Knowledge in the Science and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Surgery, ſhould be, as well in Speculation as in Practice, obtained, both to themſelves and their Apprentices.</p>
            <p>The Legiſlature then thought proper likewiſe to Enact, for particular Reaſons mentioned in the Act, That, for the future, the ſame Perſons ſhould not practiſe both as Surgeons and Barbers, but that, from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, they ſhould be ſeparated Profeſſions.</p>
            <p>The Surgeons having, ſince the Making of that Act, been more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and regularly educated, have directed and applied their whole Study and Attention towards the Advancement and Improvement of their Art.</p>
            <p>The Barbers have ever ſince been engaged in a different Way of Buſineſs, altogether foreign to the Practice of Surgery.</p>
            <p>It is evident therefore, that neither the Ends, which the Crown had in view at the original Incorporation of this Company, or thoſe which were afterwards propoſed to be attained by the Legiſlature, can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by their continuing united in the ſame Body.</p>
            <p>As the ſole End of their Incorporation was, that they ſhould overſee and ſuperintend the Practice of Surgery; and as the Legiſlature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that, by their Meeting and Aſſembly together, the Science of Surgery ſhould be promoted, as well in Speculation as in Practice; it is plain, that their whole Union and Meeting with the Barbers, if it were no Obſtacle, cannot in the leaſt be any Ways conducive towards attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Ends.</p>
            <p>But, if the Surgeons were incorporated, as a diſtinct Body, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would not then be deprived of the Help and Aſſiſtance of many ingenious Practiſers of their Profeſſion, who, at preſent, decline being Members of a Company, the Majority of which, being Strangers to their Art, cannot be ſuppoſed to have in their Views the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Improvement of it.</p>
            <p>The Majority of Perſons practiſing Surgery, would not then be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and prevented, as they now are, from being Members of the Company, by the Inconveniencies and Expences which neceſſarily attend the Execution of the ſeveral Offices of the preſent Company, which have no Relation to the Improvement and Profeſſion of Surgery; by which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0724300100:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Means, thoſe who practiſe Surgery are again divided, contrary to the Intention of the Legiſlature: The Number of theſe, at preſent, who are not Members of the Company, being almoſt double the Number of thoſe who are.</p>
            <p>The Publick Lectures, Examinations of Surgeons, and other Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, inſtituted for the Advancement of Surgery, would not then meet with any Interruption from Perſons, only Barbers, inſiſting, as they now do, that they ſhall always be preſent at ſuch Meetings.</p>
            <p>Since therefore, there are diſtinct and peculiar Privileges and Powers lodged with the Surgeons, which the Barbers ought neither to take Part or Trouble in; particularly that important Truſt, of examining Surgeons for the Royal Navy, which they have duly executed with the greateſt Chearfulneſs, to the great Advantage, as they hope, of the Publick:</p>
            <p>And, as the deſired Separation is founded upon Reaſons of general and publick Utility;</p>
            <p>The Surgeons of <hi>London</hi> humbly pray, To be ſeparated from the Barbers, as thoſe of other Countries have been, each to be made an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Corporation, and veſted with the ſame Privileges which they now enjoy under their preſent Charters.</p>
            <p>And, as all the Members of the preſent Company have an equal Intereſt in the Property belonging to the ſaid Company; and the original Members, who firſt acquired that Property, could only be Perſons ſkilled in Surgery (thoſe, practiſing as Barbers only, not having been Members of this Company till the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth); they hope, That an equitable and proportionable Diviſion and Diſtribution of their Property ſhall be made, in ſuch Manner as the Legiſlature ſhall think fit.</p>
