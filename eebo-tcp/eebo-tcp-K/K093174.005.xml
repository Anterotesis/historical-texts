            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <speaker>George.</speaker>
                  <p>I can tell you—It is for the lime-kiln; don't you ſee it juſt by?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>O yes, I do. But what is to be done to them there?</p>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, they are to be burned into lime; don't you know that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>But what is lime, and what are its uſes?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I can tell you, one; they lay it on the fields for manure. Don't you remember we ſaw a number of little heaps of it, that we took for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0191002605:5"/>
ſheep at a diſtance, and wondered they did not move. However, I believe we had better aſk our tutor about it. Will you pleaſe, Sir, to tell us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what about lime.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tutor.</speaker>
                  <p>Willingly. But ſuppoſe, as we talked about all ſorts of metals ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>time ago, I ſhould now give you a lecture about ſtones and earths of all kinds, which are equally valuable, and much more common, than metals.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray do, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhall be very glad to hear it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then. In the firſt place, the ground we tread upon, to as great a depth as it has been dug, conſiſts for the moſt part of matter of various ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and hardneſs, called by the general name of <hi>earths.</hi> In common language, indeed, only the ſoft and powdery ſubſtances are ſo named, while the hard and ſolid are called <hi>ſtone</hi> or <hi>rock:</hi> but chymiſts uſe the ſame term for all; as, in fact, earth is only
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0191002605:6"/>
crumbled ſtone, and ſtone only conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidated earth.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>What!—has the mould of my garden ever been ſtone?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>The black earth or mould which covers the ſurface wherever plants grow, conſiſts moſtly of parts of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vegetables, ſuch as ſtalks, leaves, and roots, mixed with ſand or looſe clay; but this only reaches a little way; and beneath it you always come to a bed of gravel, or clay, or ſtone of ſome kind. Now theſe earths and ſtones are diſtinguiſhed into ſeveral ſpecies, but principally into three, the properties of which make them uſeful to man for very different purpoſes, and are therefore very well worth knowing. As you began with aſking me about lime, I ſhall firſt mention that claſs of earths from which it is obtained. Theſe have derived their name of <hi>calcareous</hi> from this very circumſtance, <hi>calx</hi> being lime, in Latin; and lime is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0191002605:7"/>
got from them all in the ſame way, by burning them in a ſtrong fire. There are many kinds of calcareous earths. One of them is <hi>marble;</hi> you know what that is?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>O yes! Our parlour chimney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece and hearth are marble.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>And ſo are the monuments in the church.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>True. There are various kinds of it; white, black, yellow, grey, mottled and veined with different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; but all of them are hard and heavy ſtones, admitting a fine poliſh, on which account they are much uſed in ornamental works.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I think ſtatues are made of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; and where it is plentiful, columns, and porticoes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whole buildings. Marble is the luxury of architecture.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Where does marble come from?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>From a great many countries. Great Britain produces ſome, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0191002605:8"/>
moſtly of inferior kinds. What we uſe chiefly comes from Italy. The Greek iſlands yield ſome fine ſorts. That of Paros is of ancient fame for whiteneſs and purity, and the fineſt antique ſtatues have been made of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian marble.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe black marble will not burn into white lime.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, it will. A violent heat will expel moſt of the colouring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of marbles, and make them white. <hi>Chalk</hi> is another kind of calcareous earth. This is of a much ſofter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence than marble; being eaſily cut with a knife, and marking things on which it is rubbed. It is found in great beds in the earth; and in ſome parts of England whole hills are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Are chalk and whiting the ſame?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Whiting is made of the finer and purer particles of chalk waſhed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0191002605:9"/>
out from the reſt, and then dried in lumps. This, you know, is quite ſoft and crumbly. There are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a great variety of ſtones in the earth, harder than chalk, but ſofter than marble, which will burn to lime, and are therefore called <hi>limeſtones.</hi> Theſe differ much in colour and other properties, and accordingly furniſh lime of different qualities. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the harder the limeſtone is, the firmer is the lime made from it. Whole ridges of mountains in various parts are compoſed of limeſtone, and it is found plentifully in moſt of the hilly countries of England, to the great advantage of the inhabitants.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Will not oyſter-ſhells burn into lime? I think I have heard of oyſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell lime.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>They will; and this is another ſource of calcareous earth. The ſhells of all animals, both land and ſea, as oyſters, muſcles, cockles, crabs, lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0191002605:10"/>
ſnails, and the like, and alſo egg-ſhells of all kinds, conſiſt of this earth; and ſo does coral, which is formed by inſects under the ſea, and is very abundant in ſome countries. Vaſt quantities of ſhells are often found deep in the earth in the midſt of chalk and limeſtone beds; whence ſome have ſuppoſed that all calcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous earth is originally an animal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>But where could animals enow ever have lived to make mountains of their ſhells?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>That, indeed, I cannot anſwer. But there are ſufficient proofs that our world muſt long have exiſted in a very different ſtate from the preſent. Well—but beſides theſe purer calcareous earths, it is very frequently found mingled in different proportions with other earths. Thus, <hi>marle,</hi> which is ſo much uſed in manuring land, and of which there are a great many kinds,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0191002605:11"/>
all conſiſts of calcareous earth, united with clay and ſand; and the more of this earth it contains, the richer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure it generally makes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Is there any way of diſcovering it when it is mixed in this manner with other things?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—there is an eaſy and ſure method of diſcovering the ſmalleſt portion of it. All calcareous earth has the property of diſſolving in acids, and efferveſcing with them; that is, they bubble and hiſs when acids are poured upon them. You may readily try this at any time with a piece of chalk or any oyſter ſhell.</p>

                  <p>I will pour ſome vinegar upon an oyſter ſhell as ſoon as I get home. But now I think of it, I have often done ſo in eating oyſters, and I never obſerved it to hiſs or bubble.</p>

                  <p>Vinegar is not an acid ſtrong enough to act upon a thing ſo ſolid as a ſhell. But aqua-fortis, or ſpirit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0191002605:12"/>
of ſalt, will do it at once; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who examine the nature of foſſils always travel with a bottle of one of theſe acids, by way of a teſt of calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous earth. Your vinegar will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with chalk or whiting. This property of diſſolving in acids, and what is called neutraliſing them, or taking away their ſourneſs, has cauſed many of the calcareous earths to be uſed in medicine. You know that ſometimes our food turns very ſour upon the ſtomach, and occaſions the pain called heart-burn, and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy ſymptoms. In theſe caſes it is common to give chalk, or powdered ſhells, or other things of this kind, which afford relief by deſtroying the acid.</p>

                  <p>It is; but it has ſome peculiar properties which diſtinguiſh it from other calcareous earths, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly it will not burn to lime. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia is an artificial production, got from one of the ingredients in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, called the bitter purging ſalt.</p>

                  <p>Such of them as are hard ſtone, as the marbles and many of the lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, are uſed for the ſame purpoſes as other ſtones. But their great uſe is in the form of lime, which is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of many curious properties that I will now explain to you. When freſh burnt, it is called <hi>quicklime,</hi> on account of the heat and life, as it were, which it poſſeſſes. Have you ever ſeen a lump of it put into water?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Were you not much ſurpriſed to ſee it ſwell and crack to pieces,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0191002605:14"/>
with a hiſſing noiſe, and a great ſmoke and heat?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I was, indeed. But what is the cauſe of this?—how can cold water occaſion ſo much heat?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>I will tell you. The ſtrong heat to which calcareous earth is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in making it lime, expels all the water it contained (for all earths, as well as almoſt every thing elſe, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally contain water), and alſo a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of air which was united with it. At the ſame time it imbibes a good deal of fire, which remains fixed in its ſubſtance, even after it has grown cool to the touch. If water be now added to this quicklime, it is drunk in again with ſuch rapidity, as to crack and break the lime to pieces. At the ſame time, moſt of the fire it had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed is driven out again, and makes itſelf ſenſible by its effects, burning all the things that it touches, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0191002605:15"/>
turning the water to ſteam. This ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is called <hi>ſlacking</hi> of lime. The water in which lime is ſlacked diſſolves a part of it, and acquires a very pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent harſh taſte: this is uſed in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine under the name of lime-water. If, inſtead of ſoaking quicklime in water, it is expoſed for ſome time to the air, it attracts moiſture ſlowly, and by degrees falls to powder, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much heat or diſturbance. But whether lime be ſlacked in water or air, it does not at firſt return to the ſtate in which it was before, ſince it ſtill remains deprived of its air; and on that account is ſtill pungent and cauſtic. At length, however, it reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers this alſo from the atmoſphere, and is then calcareous earth as at firſt. Now, it is upon ſome of theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that the utility of lime depends. In the firſt place, its burning and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding quality makes it uſeful to the tanner, in looſening all the hair from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0191002605:16"/>
the hides; and deſtroying the fleſh and fat that adhere to them. And ſo in various other trades it is uſed as a great cleanſer and purifier.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>I have a thought come into my head. When it is laid upon the ground I ſuppoſe its uſe muſt be to burn up the weeds.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>True—that is part of its uſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>But it muſt burn up the good graſs and corn too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Properly objected. But the caſe is, that the farmer does not ſow his ſeeds till the lime is rendered mild by expoſure to the air and weather, and is well mixed with the ſoil. And even then it is reckoned a hot and forcing manure, chiefly fit for cold and wet lands. The principal uſe of lime, however, is as an ingredient in <hi>mortar.</hi> This, you know, is the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which bricks and ſtones are held together in building. It is made of freſh ſlaked lime and a proportion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0191002605:17"/>
of ſand well mixed together; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſome chopped hair is put into it. The lime binds with the other ingredients; and in length of time, the mortar, if well made, becomes as hard or harder than ſtone itſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I have heard of the mortar in very old buildings being harder and ſtronger than any made at preſent.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>That is only on account of its age. Burning lime and making mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar are as well underſtood now as ever; but in order to have it excellent, the lime ſhould be of a good quality, and uſed very freſh. Some ſorts of lime have the property of making mortar which will harden under water, whence it is much valued for bridges, locks, wharfs, and the like.</p>

                  <p>The powder you call plaſter of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0191002605:18"/>
Paris is made of an earth named <hi>gypſum,</hi> of which there are ſeveral kinds. <hi>Alabaſter</hi> is a ſtone of this ſort, and hard enough to be uſed like marble. The gypſeous earths are of the calcareous kind, but they have naturally a portion of acid united with them, whence they will not efferveſce on having acid poured on them. But they are diſtinguiſhed by the property, that after being calcined or burned in the fire, and reduced to powder, they will ſet into a ſolid body by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of water alone. This makes them very uſeful for ornamental plaſters, that are to receive a form or impreſſion, ſuch as the ſtucco for the ceilings of rooms.</p>
                  <p>Well—we have ſaid enough about calcareous earths; now to another claſs, the <hi>Argillaceous.</hi>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I think I know what thoſe are. <hi>Argilla</hi> is Latin for <hi>clay.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>True; and they are alſo called
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0191002605:19"/>
                     <hi>clayey</hi> earths. In general, theſe earths are of a ſoft texture and a ſort of greaſy feel; but they are peculiarly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the property of becoming ſticky on being tempered with water, ſo that they may be drawn out, and worked into form like a paſte. Have you ever, when you were a little boy, made a clay houſe?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes. I have.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you well know the manner in which clay is tempered, and worked for this purpoſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—and I remember helping to make little pots and mugs of clay.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you imitated the potter's trade; for all utenſils of earthen ware are made of clays either pure or mixed. This is one of the oldeſt arts among mankind, and one of the moſt uſeful. They furniſh materials for building, too; for bricks and tiles are made of theſe earths. But in order to be fit for theſe purpoſes, it is neceſſary that clay
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0191002605:20"/>
ſhould not only be ſoft and ductile while it is forming, but capable of being hardened afterwards. And this it is, by the aſſiſtance of fire. Pottery ware and bricks are burned with a ſtrong heat in kilns, by which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a hardneſs equal to that of the hardeſt ſtones.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I think I have read of bricks being baked by the ſun's heat alone in very hot countries.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>True; and they may ſerve for building in climates where rain ſcarcely ever falls; but heavy ſhowers would waſh them away. Fire ſeems to change the nature of clays; for after they have undergone its operation, they become incapable of returning again to a ſoft and ductile ſtate. You might ſteep brick duſt or pounded pots in water ever ſo long without making it hold together in the leaſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe there are many kinds of clays.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0191002605:21"/>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>There are. Argillaceous earths differ greatly from each other in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, purity, and other qualities. Some are perfectly white, as that of which tobacco-pipes are made. Others are blue, brown, yellow, and in ſhort of all hues, which they owe to mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of other earths or metals. Thoſe which burn red contain a portion of iron. No clays are found perfectly pure; but they are mixed with more or leſs of other earths. The common brick clays contain a large proportion of ſand, which often makes them crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and periſhable. In general, the fineſt earthen-ware is made of the pureſt and whiteſt clays; but other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are mixed in order to harden and ſtrengthen them. Thus <hi>porcelain,</hi> or <hi>china,</hi> is made with a clayey earth mixed with a ſtone of a vitrifiable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, which may be melted into glaſs; and the fine pottery called <hi>queen's-ware</hi> is a mixture of tobacco-pipe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0191002605:22"/>
clay, and flints burned and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Common <hi>ſtone-ware</hi> is a coarſe mixture of this ſort. Some ſpecies of pottery are made with mixtures of burned and unburned clay; the former, as I told you before, being incapable of becoming ſoft again with water like a natural clay.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—the richeſt ſoils are thoſe which have a proportion of clay; and marl, which I have already mentioned as a manure, generally contains a good deal of it. Then, clay has the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of abſorbing oil or greaſe, whence ſome kinds of it are uſed like ſoap for cleaning cloaths. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance called <hi>Fuller's earth</hi> is a mixed earth of the argillaceous kind; and its uſe in taking out the oil which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally adheres to wool is ſo great, that it has been one cauſe of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of our woollen cloths.</p>

                  <p>Then I ſuppoſe it is found in England.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes. There are pits of the beſt kind of it near Woburn in Bedford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. A clayey ſtone called ſoap rock has exactly the feel and look of ſoap, and will even lather with water. The different kinds of ſlate, too, are ſtones of the argillaceous claſs; and very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones, for covering houſes, and other purpoſes.</p>

                  <p>You have mentioned ſomething of ſand and flints, but you have not told us what ſort of earths they are.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>I reſerved that till I ſpoke of the third great claſs of earths. This is the <hi>ſiliceous</hi> claſs, ſo named from <hi>ſilex,</hi> which is Latin for a flint-ſtone. They have alſo been called <hi>vitrifiable</hi> earths,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0191002605:24"/>
becauſe they are the principal ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in glaſs, named in Latin <hi>vitrum.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I have heard of flint glaſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—but neither flint, nor any other of the kind will make glaſs, even by the ſtrongeſt heat, without ſome addition; but this we will ſpeak of by and bye. I ſhall now tell you the principal properties of theſe earths. They are all very hard, and will ſtrike fire with ſteel, when in a maſs large enough for the ſtroke. They moſtly run into particular ſhapes, with ſharp angles and points, and have a certain degree of tranſparency; which has made them alſo be called <hi>cryſtalline</hi> earths. They do not in the leaſt ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with water, like clays; nor are they affected by acids, nor do they burn to lime, like the calcareous earths. As to the different kinds of them, <hi>flint</hi> has already been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is a very common production in ſome parts, and is generally met
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0191002605:25"/>
with in pebbles or round lumps. What is called the <hi>ſhingle</hi> on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore chiefly conſiſts of it; and the ploughed fields in ſome places are almoſt entirely covered with flint-ſtones.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>But do they not hinder the corn from growing?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>The corn, to be ſure, cannot take root upon them; but I believe it has been found that the protection they afford to the young plants which grow under them, is more than equal to the harm they do by taking up room. Flints are alſo frequently found imbedded in chalk under the ground. Thoſe uſed in the Staffordſhire potte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries chiefly come from the chalk-pits near Graveſend. So much for flints. You have ſeen white pebbles, which are ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſparent, and when broken, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble white ſugar-candy. They are common on the ſea-ſhore, and beds of rivers.</p>

                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>O, yes. We call them fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0191002605:26"/>
When they are rubbed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the dark they ſend out great flaſhes of light, and have a particular ſmell.</p>

                  <p>It is called ſo by way of ſimile: thus we ſay of a thing, <q rend="inline">"it is as clear as cryſtal."</q> But the only true cryſtal is an earth of the kind I have been deſcribing. Well—now we come to <hi>ſand;</hi> for this is properly only quartz in a powdery ſtate. If you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0191002605:27"/>
examine the grains of ſand ſingly, or look at them with a magnifying glaſs, you will find them all either entirely or partly tranſparent; and in ſome of the white ſhining ſands the grains are all little bright cryſtals.</p>

                  <speaker>H.</speaker>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>That is owing to ſome mixture, generally of the metallic kind. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I once told you that all ſands were ſuppoſed to contain a ſmall portion of gold. It is more certain that many of them contain iron.</p>

                  <p>But what could have brought this quartz and cryſtal into powder, ſo as to have produced all the ſand in the world?</p>

                  <p>That is not very eaſy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. On the ſea-ſhore, however, the inceſſant rolling of the pebbles by the waves is enough in time to grind them to powder; and there is reaſon to believe that the greateſt part of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0191002605:28"/>
what is now dry land, was once ſea, which may account for the vaſt beds of ſand met with inland.</p>

                  <p>I have ſeen ſome ſtone ſo ſoft that one might crumble it between ones fingers, and then it ſeemed to turn to ſand.</p>

                  <p>There are ſeveral of this kind, more or leſs ſolid, which are chiefly compoſed of ſand conglutinated by ſome natural cement. Such are called <hi>ſand-ſtone,</hi> or <hi>freeſtone;</hi> and are uſed for various purpoſes, in building, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grind ſtones, and the like, according to their hardneſs.</p>

                  <p>Pray what are the common peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that the ſtreets are paved with? I am ſure they ſtrike fire enough with the horſe's ſhoes.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>They are ſtones of the ſiliceous kind, either pure or mixed with other earths. One of the hardeſt and beſt for this purpoſe is called <hi>granite,</hi> which is of various kinds and colours,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0191002605:29"/>
but always conſiſts of grains of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſiliceous earths cemented toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſtreets of London are paved with granite, brought from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. In ſome other ſtones, theſe bits of different earths diſperſed through the cement are ſo large, as to look like plums in a pudding; whence they have obtained the name of <hi>pudding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I think there is a kind of ſtones that you have not yet mentioned—precious ſtones.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe, too, are all of the ſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous claſs;—from the opake or half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſparent, as agate, jaſper, cornelian, and the like, to the perfectly clear and brilliant ones, as ruby, emerald, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paz, ſapphire, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Diamond, no doubt, is one of them.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>So it has commonly been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, and the pureſt of all; but ſome late experiments have ſhewn, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0191002605:30"/>
though it is the hardeſt body in nature, it may be totally diſperſed into ſmoke and flame by a ſtrong fire; ſo that mineralogiſts will now hardly allow it to be a ſtone at all, but claſs it among inflammable ſubſtances. The precious ſtones above mentioned owe their different colours chiefly to ſome metallic mixture. They are in general extremely hard, ſo as to cut glaſs, and one another; but diamond will cut all the reſt.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; and in this rarity conſiſts the greateſt part of their value. They are, indeed, beautiful objects; but the figure they make in proportion to their expence is ſo very ſmall, that their high price may be reckoned one of the principal follies among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. What proportion can there poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be between the worth of a glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſtone as big as a hazel-nut, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0191002605:31"/>
a magnificent houſe and gardens, or a large tract of country, covered with noble woods and rich meadows and corn fields? And as to the mere glitter, a large luſtre of cut glaſs has an infinitely greater effect on the eye than all the jewels of a ſovereign prince.</p>

                  <p>Will you pleaſe to tell us now how glaſs is made?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Willingly. The baſe of it is, as I ſaid before, ſome earth of the ſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous claſs. Thoſe commonly uſed are flint and ſand. Flint is firſt burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or calcined, which makes it quite white, like enamel; and it is then powdered. This is the material ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed for ſome very white glaſſes; but ſand is that commonly preferred, as being already in a powdery form. The white cryſtalline ſands are uſed for fine glaſs; the brown or yellow for the common ſort. As theſe earths will not melt by themſelves, the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in making glaſs is ſomewhat that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0191002605:32"/>
promotes their fuſion. Various things will do this; but what is generally uſed is an alkaline ſalt, obtained from the aſhes of burnt vegetables. Of this there are ſeveral kinds, as pot-aſh, pearl-aſh, barilla, and kelp. The ſalt is mixed with the ſand in a certain proportion, and the mixture then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in earthen pots to a violent heat, till it is thoroughly melted. The maſs is then taken while hot and fluid, in ſuch quantities as are wanted, and faſhioned by blowing and the uſe of ſheers and other inſtruments. You muſt ſee this done, ſome time, for it is one of the moſt curious and pleaſing of all manufactures; and it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to form an idea of the eaſe and dexterity with which glaſs is wrought, without an actual view.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>In many places. Some of the fineſt, in London; but the coarſer kinds generally where coals are cheap; as at Newcaſtle and its neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in Lancaſhire, at Stombridge, Briſtol, and South Wales. I ſhould have told you, however, that in our fineſt and moſt brilliant glaſs, a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the calx of lead is put, which vitrifies with the other ingredients, and gives the glaſs more firmneſs and denſity. The blue, yellow and red glaſſes are coloured with the calxes of other metals. As to the common green glaſs, it is made with an alkali that has a good deal of calcareous earth remaining with the aſhes of the plant. But to underſtand all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent circumſtances of glaſs making, one muſt have a thorough knowledge of chymiſtry.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I think making of glaſs is one of the fineſt inventions of human ſkill.</p>

                  <p>It is perhaps not of that capital importance that ſome other arts poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs; but it has been a great addition to the comfort and pleaſure of life in many ways. Nothing makes ſuch clean and agreeable veſſels as glaſs, which has the quality of not being corroded by any kind of liquor, as well as that of ſhowing its contents by its tranſparency. Hence it is greatly preferable to the moſt precious metals for drinking out of; and for the ſame reaſons it is preferred to every other material for chymical utenſils, where the heat to be employed is not ſtrong enough to melt it.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Aye; that is a moſt material comfort in a climate like ours, where we ſo often wiſh to let in the light, and keep out the cold wind and rain. What could be more gloomy than to ſit in the dark, or with no other light than came in through ſmall holes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0191002605:35"/>
with oiled paper or bladder, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſee any thing paſſing without doors! Yet this muſt have been the caſe with the moſt ſumptuous palaces before the invention of window-glaſs, which was a good deal later than that of bottles and drinking glaſſes.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>They are indeed very elegant pieces of furniture, and very coſtly too. The art of caſting glaſs into large plates, big enough to reach al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt from the bottom to the top of a room, is but lately introduced into this country from France. But the moſt ſplendid and brilliant manner of employing glaſs is in luſtres and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers, hung round with drops cut ſo as to reflect the light with all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the rainbow. Some of the ſhops in London, filled with theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, appear to realize all the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

                  <p>I did not mean to paſs them over, I aſſure you. By the curious invention of optical glaſſes of various kinds, not only the natural defects of the ſight have been remedied, and old-age has been in ſome meaſure lightened of one of its calamities, but the ſenſe of ſeeing has been wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully extended. The teleſcope has brought diſtant objects within our view, while the microſcope has given us a clear ſurvey of near objects too minute for our unaſſiſted eyes. By means of both, ſome of the brighteſt diſcoveries of the moderns have been made; ſo that glaſs has proved not leſs admirable in promoting ſcience, than in contributing to ſplendour and convenience. Well—I don't know that I have any thing more at preſent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0191002605:37"/>
to ſay relative to the claſs of earths. We have gone through the principal circumſtances belonging to their three great diviſions, the <hi>calcareous, argilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous,</hi> and <hi>ſiliceous.</hi> You will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, however, that moſt of the earths and ſtones offered by nature are not any one of theſe kinds perfectly pure, but contain a mixture of one or both the others. There is not a pebble that you can pick up which would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the ſkill of a mineralogiſt fully to aſcertain its properties, and the materials of its compoſition.

               <p>IT was a delightful evening about the end of Auguſt. The ſun ſetting in a pure ſky illuminated the tops of the weſtern hills, and tipped the oppoſite trees with a yellow luſtre.</p>
               <p>A traveller, with ſun-burnt cheeks and duſty feet, ſtrong and active, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a knapſack at his back, had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſummit of a ſteep aſcent, and ſtood gazing on the plain below.</p>
               <p>This was a wide tract of champaign country, chequered with villages, whoſe towers and ſpires peeped above the trees in which they were emboſomed. The ſpace between them was chiefly arable land, from which the laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of harveſt were buſily carrying away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0191002605:39"/>
A rivulet winded through the plain, its courſe marked with grey willows. On its banks were verdant meadows, covered with lowing herds, moving ſlowly to the milkmaids, who came tripping along with pails on their heads. A thick wood cloathed the ſide of a gentle eminence riſing from the water, crowned with the ruins of an ancient caſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> (that was the traveller's name) dropt on one knee, and claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hands, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, welcome, my dear native land! Many a ſweet ſpot have I ſeen ſince I left thee, but none ſo ſweet as thou! Never has thy dear image been out of my memory; and now, with what tranſport do I retrace all thy charms.

               <p>As he deſcended into the plain,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0191002605:40"/>
he overtook a little group of children, merrily walking along the path, and ſtopping now and then to gather ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the hedge.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Where are you going, my dears?"</q> ſaid Edward.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>The little innocents told their names. Edward's heart leaped at the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"And what is <hi>your</hi> name, my dear?"</q> ſaid he to a pretty girl, ſomewhat older than the reſt, who hung back ſhyly, and held the hand of a ruddy white-headed boy, juſt breeched.</p>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"And can you ſhow me the houſe you live at, Roſe?"</q> ſaid Edward.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"If you pleaſe,"</q> anſwered Roſe, heſitatingly.</p>
               <p>They walked on. Edward ſaid but little, for his heart was full, but he frequently kiſſed little Roger.</p>
               <p>Coming at length to a ſtile, from which a path led acroſs a little cloſe,

                  <q rend="inline">"This is the way to our houſe,"</q> ſaid Roſe.</p>
               <p>The other children parted. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſet down Roger, and got over the ſtile. He ſtill, however, kept hold of the boy's hand. He trembled, and looked wildly around him.</p>
               <p>When they approached the houſe, an old maſtiff came running to meet the children. He looked up at Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rather ſourly, and gave a little growl; when all at once his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance changed; he leaped upon him, licked his hand, wagged his tail, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured in a ſoft voice, and ſeemed quite overcome with joy. Edward ſtooped down, patted his head, and cried, <q rend="inline">"poor Captain, what, are you alive yet?"</q> Roſe was ſurpriſed that the ſtranger and their dog ſhould know one another.</p>
               <p>They all entered the houſe together. A good-looking middle-aged woman was buſied in preparing articles of

cookery, aſſiſted by her grown-up daughter. She ſpoke to the children as they came in, and caſting a look of ſome ſurpriſe on Edward, aſked him what his buſineſs was.</p>
               <p>Edward was ſome time ſilent; at length with a faultering voice he cried, <q rend="inline">"Have you forgot me, mother?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>News of Edward's arrival ſoon flew acroſs the yard, and in came from the barn his father, his next brother Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, and the third, William. The

               <p>An aged white headed labourer came in, and held out his ſhrivelled hand. Edward gave it a hearty ſqueeze. <q rend="inline">"God bleſs you,"</q> ſaid old Iſaac; <q rend="inline">"this is the beſt day I have ſeen this many a year."</q>

Here how was I forced to bluſh for my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe avarice and rapacity ſo often have laid waſte this fair land, and brought on it all the horrors of famine and deſolation!

               <head>THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.</head>
               <p>KEEPER was a farmer's maſtiff, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, brave, and vigilant. One day, as he was ranging at ſome diſtance from home, he eſpied a Wolf and Fox ſitting together at the corner of a wood. <hi>Keeper,</hi> not much liking their looks, though by no means fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, was turning another way, when they called after him, and civilly deſired him to ſtay. <q rend="inline">"Surely, Sir, (ſays <hi>Reynard</hi>), you won't diſown your relations. My couſin <hi>Ghaunt</hi> and I were juſt talking over family matters, and we both agreed that we had the honour of reckoning you among our kin. You muſt know,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0191002605:54"/>
that according to the beſt accounts, the wolves and dogs were originally one race in the foreſts of Armenia; but the dogs, taking to living with man, have ſince become inhabitants of towns and villages, while the wolves have retained their ancient mode of life. As to my anceſtors, the foxes, they were a branch of the ſame family who ſettled farther northwards, where they became ſtinted in their growth, and adopted the cuſtom of living in holes under ground. The cold has ſharpened our noſes, and given us a thicker fur and buſhy tails to keep us warm. But we have all a family likeneſs which it is impoſſible to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; and I am ſure it is our intereſt to be good friends with each other."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The wolf was of the ſame opinion; and <hi>Keeper,</hi> looking narrowly at them, could not help acknowledging their relationſhip. As he had a generous heart, he readily entered into friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0191002605:55"/>
with them. They took a ramble together; but <hi>Keeper</hi> was rather ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at obſerving the ſuſpicious ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which ſome of the weaker ſort of animals ſurveyed them, and wondered at the haſty flight of a flock of ſheep as ſoon as they came within view. However, he gave his couſins a cordial invitation to come and ſee him at his yard, and then took his leave.</p>
               <p>They did not fail to come the next day about duſk. <hi>Keeper</hi> received them kindly, and treated them with part of his own ſupper. They ſtaid with him till after dark, and then marched off with many compliments. The next morning, word was brought to the farm that a gooſe and three goſlings were miſſing, and that a couple of lambs were found almoſt devoured in the home-field. <hi>Keeper</hi> was too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt himſelf readily to ſuſpect others, ſo he never thought of his kinſmen on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0191002605:56"/>
the occaſion. Soon after, they paid him a ſecond evening viſit, and next day another loſs appeared, of a hen and her chickens, and a fat ſheep. Now <hi>Keeper</hi> could not help miſtruſting a little, and blamed himſelf for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtrangers without his maſter's knowledge. However, he ſtill did not love to think ill of his own relations.</p>
               <p>They came a third time. <hi>Keeper</hi> received them rather coldly, and hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſhould like better to ſee them in the day-time; but they excuſed themſelves for want of leiſure. When they took their leaves, he reſolved to follow at ſome diſtance and watch their motions. A litter of young pigs happened to be lying under a hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtack without the yard. The wolf ſeized one by the back, and ran off with him. The pig ſet up a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſqueal; and <hi>Keeper</hi> running up at the noiſe, caught his dear couſin in the fact. He flew at him, and made

him relinquiſh his prey, though not without much ſnarling and growling. The fox, who had been prowling about the hen-rooſt, now came up, and began to make proteſtations of his own innocence, with heavy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches againſt the wolf for thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing the family. <q rend="inline">"Begone, ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels both!

armies in their march, or devoured while green as fodder for the horſes. Pillage, robbery, and murder, are always going on in the out-ſkirts of the beſt diſciplined camp. Then, conſider what muſt happen in every ſiege. On the firſt approach of the enemy, all the buildings in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of a town are demoliſhed, and all the trees in gardens and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic walks are cut down, leſt they ſhould afford ſhelter to the beſiegers. As the ſiege goes on, bombs, hot balls, and cannon-ſhot, are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flying about, by which the greateſt part of a town is ruined or laid in aſhes, and many of the innocent people killed and maimed. If the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance is obſtinate, famine and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence are ſure to take place; and if the garriſon holds out to the laſt, and the town is taken by ſtorm, it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally given up to be pillaged by the enraged and licentious ſoldiery.</p>

It would be eaſy to bring too many examples of cruelty exerciſed upon a conquered country, even in very late times, when war is ſaid to be carried on with ſo much humanity; but, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, how can it be otherwiſe? The art of war is eſſentially that of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it is impoſſible there ſhould be a mild and merciful way of murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ruining one's fellow-creatures. Soldiers, as men, are often humane, but war muſt ever be cruel. Though Homer has filled his Iliad with the exploits of fighting heroes, yet he makes Jupiter addreſs Mars, the God of War, in terms of the utmoſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence.</p>

                  <p>To a very numerous one, with which it is worth your while to get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. Let us ſit down and examine them. The petal, you obſerve, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of four ſlat leaves ſet oppoſite to each other, or croſs-wiſe. From this circumſtance the flowers have been called <hi>cruciform.</hi> As moſt plants with flowers of this kind bear their ſeeds in pods, they have likewiſe been called the <hi>ſiliquoſe</hi> plants, <hi>ſiliqua</hi> being the Latin for a pod.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>True; and therefore the name is not a good one. Now pull off the petals one by one. You ſee they are faſtened by long claws within the flower-cup. Now count the chives.</p>

                  <p>There are ſix.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>But they are not all of the ſame length—two are much ſhorter than the reſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Well obſerved. It is from this that Linnaeus has formed a particular claſs for the whole tribe, which he calls <hi>tetradynamia,</hi> a word implying <hi>four powers,</hi> or the <hi>power of four,</hi> as if the four longer chives were more perfect and efficacious than the two ſhorter; which, however, we do not know to be the caſe. This ſuperior length of four chives is conſpicuous in moſt plants of this tribe, but not in all. They have, however, other reſemblances which are ſufficient to conſtitute them a natural family; and accordingly all botaniſts have made them ſuch.</p>
                  <p>The flowers, as I have ſaid, have in all of them four petals placed croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The calyx alſo conſiſts of four oblong and hollow leaves. There is a ſingle piſtil, ſtanding upon a ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bud,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0191002605:72"/>
which turns either into a long pod, or a ſhort round one called a pouch; and hence are formed the two great branches of the family, the pod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the pouched. The ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſel has two valves or external open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with a partition between. The ſeeds are ſmall and roundiſh, attached alternately to both ſutures or joinings of the valves.</p>
                  <p>Do you obſerve all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſhall examine them more minutely in a larger plant of the kind. Further, almoſt all of theſe plants have ſomewhat of a biting taſte, and alſo a diſagreeable ſmell in their leaves, eſpecially when decayed. A turnep field, you know, ſmells but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently; and cabbage, which is one of this claſs, is apt to be remarkably offenſive.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Yes—there is nothing worſe than rotten cabbage leaves.</p>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>And the very water in which they are boiled is enough to ſcent a whole houſe.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>The flowers, however, of almoſt all the family are fragrant, and ſome remarkably ſo. What do you think of wall-flowers and ſtocks?</p>

                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Then they are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>No—and eſpecially as not one of the whole claſs, I believe, is poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous; but, on the contrary, many of them afford good food for man and beaſt. Shall I tell you about the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of them?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray do, Sir.</p>

                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>The pungency of taſte which ſo many of them poſſeſs, has cauſed them
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0191002605:74"/>
to be uſed for ſallad herbs. Thus, we have creſs, water-creſs, and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard; to which might be added many more which grow wild, as ladyſmock, wild rocket, hedge-muſtard, and jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by-the-hedge, or ſauce-alone. Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard, you know, is alſo greatly uſed for its ſeeds, the powder or flour of which, made into a ſort of paſte with ſalt and water, is eaten with many kinds of meat. Rape-ſeeds are very ſimilar to them, and from both an oil is preſſed out, of the mild or taſteleſs kind, as it is likewiſe from cole-ſeed, another product of this claſs. Scurvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs, which is a pungent plant of this family, growing by the ſea-ſide, has obtained its name from being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the ſcurvy. Then there is horſe-radiſh, with the root of which I am ſure you are well acquainted, as a companion to roaſt-beef. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon radiſh, too, is a plant of this kind, which has a good deal of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0191002605:75"/>
One ſort of it has a root like a turnep, which brings it near in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the turnep itſelf. This laſt plant, though affording a ſweet and mild nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, has naturally a degree of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency and rankneſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>That, I ſuppoſe, is the reaſon why turnepy milk and butter have ſuch a ſtrong taſte.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>It is.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Then why do they feed cows with it?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>In this caſe, as in many others, quality is ſacrificed to quantity. But the better uſe of turneps to the farmer is to fatten ſheep and cattle. By its aſſiſtance he is enabled to keep many more of theſe animals than he otherwiſe could find graſs or hay for; and the culture of turneps prepares his land for grain as well, or better, than could be done by letting it lie quite fallow. The turnep-huſbandry, as it is called,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0191002605:76"/>
is one of the capital modern improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of agriculture.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I think I have heard that Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk is famous for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>It is ſo. That county abounds in light ſandy lands, which are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly ſuitable to turneps. But they are now grown in many parts of the kingdom beſides. Well—but we muſt ſay ſomewhat more about cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, an article of food of very long ſtanding. The original ſpecies of this is a ſea-ſide plant; but cultivation has produced a great number of varieties well-known in our gardens, as white and red cabbage, kale, colewort, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coli, borecole, and cauliflower.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>But the flower of cauliflower does not ſeem at all like that of cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage or turnep.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>The white head, called its flower, is not properly ſo, but conſiſts of a cluſter of imperfect buds. If they are left to grow for ſeed, they throw
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0191002605:77"/>
out ſome ſpikes of yellow flowers like common cabbage. Brocoli heads are of the ſame kind. As to the head of white or red cabbage, it conſiſts of a vaſt number of leaves cloſing round each other, by which the innermoſt are prevented from expanding, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main white on account of the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the light and air. This part, you know, is moſt valued for food. In ſome countries they cut cabbage heads into quarters, and make them undergo a kind of acid fermentation; after which they are ſalted and preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for winter food under the name of ſour krout.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Cattle, too, are ſometimes fed with cabbage, I believe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, and large fields of them are cultivated for that purpoſe. They ſucceed beſt in ſtiff clayey ſoils, where they ſometimes grow to an enormous bigneſs. They are given to milch kine, as well as to fattening cattle.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Do not they give a bad taſte to the milk?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>They are apt to do ſo unleſs great care is taken to pick off all the decayed leaves.</p>
                  <p>Coleworts, which are a ſmaller ſort of cabbage, are ſometimes grown for feeding ſheep and cattle. I think I have now mentioned moſt of the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plants of this family, which, you ſee, are numerous and important. They both yield beef and mutton, and the ſauce to them. But many of the ſpecies are troubleſome weeds. You ſee how yonder corn is overrun with yellow flowers.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes. They are as thick as if they had been ſown.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>They are of this family, and called charlock, or wild muſtard, or corn kale, which, indeed, are not all exactly the ſame things, though nearly reſembling. Theſe produce ſuch plenty of ſeeds, that it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0191002605:79"/>
to clear a field of them if once they are ſuffered to grow till the ſeeds ripen. An extremely common weed in gardens and by road-ſides is ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's—purſe, which is a very good ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of the pouch bearing plants of this tribe, its ſeed-veſſels being exactly the figure of a heart. Ladyſmock is often ſo abundant a weed in wet mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows as to make them all over white with its flowers. Some call this plant cuckow-flower, becauſe its flowering is about the ſame time with the firſt appearance of that bird in the ſpring.</p>

to ſome other flower, a yellow one, which appears at the ſame ſeaſon. But ſtill earlier than this time, walls and hedge-banks are enlivened by a very ſmall white flower, called whitlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs, which is one of this tribe.</p>

                  <p>Not very eaſy, for the general ſimilarity of the flowers is ſo great, that little diſtinction can be drawn from them. The marks of the ſpecies are chiefly taken from the form and manner of growth of the ſeed veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and we will examine ſome of them by the deſcriptions in a book of botany. There is one very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeed-veſſel which probably you have obſerved in the garden. It is a perfectly round large flat pouch, which after it has ſhed its ſeed, remains on the ſtalk, and looks like a thin white bladder. The plant bearing it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called honeſty.</p>

                  <p>True. So much, then, for the tetradynamious or cruciform-flowered plants. You cannot well miſtake them for any other claſs, if you remark the ſix chives, four of them, generally, but not always, longer than the two others; the ſingle piſtil changing either into a long pod or a round pouch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſeeds; the four oppoſite petals of the flower, and four leaves of the calyx. You may ſafely make a ſallad of the young leaves wherever you find them; the worſt they can do to you is to bite your tongue.</p>

               <head>GENEROUS REVENGE.</head>
               <p>AT the period when the Republic of Genoa was divided between the factions of the nobles and the people,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0191002605:82"/>
                  <hi>Uberto,</hi> a man of low origin, but of an elevated mind and ſuperior talents, and enriched by commerce, having raiſed himſelf to be the head of the popular party, maintained for a conſiderable time a democratical form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The nobles at length, uniting all their efforts, ſucceeded in ſubverting this ſtate of things, and regained their former ſupremacy. They uſed their victory with conſiderable rigour; and in particular, having impriſoned <hi>Uberto,</hi> proceeded againſt him as a traitor, and thought they diſplayed ſufficient lenity in paſſing a ſentence upon him of perpetual baniſhment, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of all his property. <hi>Adorno,</hi> who was then poſſeſſed of the firſt magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracy, a man haughty in temper, and proud of ancient nobility, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not void of generous ſentiments, in pronouncing this ſentence on <hi>Uberto,</hi> aggravated its ſeverity by the inſolent
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0191002605:83"/>
terms in which he conveyed it. <q rend="inline">"You (ſaid he)—you, the ſon of a baſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic, who have dared to trample upon the nobles of Genoa—You, by their clemency, are only doomed to ſhrink again into the nothing whence you ſprung."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uberto</hi> received his condemnation with reſpectful ſubmiſſion to the court; yet ſtung by the manner in which it was expreſſed, he could not forbear ſaying to <hi>Adorno</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"that perhaps he might hereafter find cauſe to repent the language he had uſed to a man capable of ſentiments as elevated as his own."</q> He then made his obeiſance and retired; and, after taking leave of his friends, embarked in a veſſel bound for Naples, and quitted his native country without a tear.</p>
               <p>He collected ſome debts due to him in the Neapolitan dominions, and with the wreck of his fortune went to ſettle on one of the iſlands in the Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0191002605:84"/>
belonging to the ſtate of Venice. Here his induſtry and capacity in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile purſuits raiſed him in a courſe of years to greater wealth than he had poſſeſſed in his moſt proſperous days at Genoa; and his reputation for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and generoſity equalled his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>Among other places which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſited as a merchant, was the city of Tunis, at that time in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Venetians, though hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to moſt of the other Italian ſtates, and eſpecially to Genoa. As <hi>Uberto</hi> was on a viſit to one of the firſt men of that place at his country houſe, he ſaw a young chriſtian ſlave at work in irons, whoſe appearance excited his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The youth ſeemed oppreſſed with labour to which his delicate frame had not been accuſtomed, and while he leaned at intervals upon the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with which he was working, a ſigh burſt from his full heart, and a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0191002605:85"/>
tear ſtole down his cheek. <hi>Uberto</hi> eyed him with tender compaſſion, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him in Italian. The youth eagerly caught the ſounds of his native tongue, and replying to his enquiries, informed him he was a Genoeſe. <q rend="inline">"And what is your name, young man? (ſaid <hi>Uberto</hi>) You need not be afraid of confeſſing to <hi>me</hi> your birth and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Alas! (he anſwered) I fear my captors already ſuſpect enough to demand a large ranſom. My father is indeed one of the firſt men in Genoa. His name is <hi>Adorno,</hi> and I am his only ſon."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>Adorno!</hi>"</q> 
                  <hi>Uberto</hi> checked himſelf from uttering more aloud, but to himſelf he cried, <q rend="inline">"Thank heaven! then I ſhall be nobly revenged."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He took leave of the youth, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went to enquire after the corſair captain who claimed a right in young <hi>Adorno,</hi> and having found him, demanded the price of his ranſom.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0191002605:86"/>
He learned that he was conſidered as a capture of value, and that leſs than two thouſand crowns would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. <hi>Uberto</hi> paid the ſum; and cauſing his ſervant to follow him with a horſe and a complete ſuit of handſome apparel, he returned to the youth who was working as before, and told him he was free. With his own hands he took off his fetters, and helped him to change his dieſs, and mount on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. The youth was tempted to think it all a dream, and the flutter of emotion almoſt deprived him of the power of returning thanks to his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous benefactor. He was ſoon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, convinced of the reality of his good fortune, by ſharing the lodging and table of <hi>Uberto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a ſtay of ſome days at Tunis to diſpatch the remainder of his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Uberto</hi> departed homewards, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by young <hi>Adorno,</hi> who by his pleaſing manners had highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiated
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0191002605:87"/>
himſelf with him. <hi>Uberto</hi> kept him ſome time at his houſe, treating him with all the reſpect and affection he could have ſhown for the ſon of his deareſt friend. At length, having a ſafe opportunity of ſending him to Genoa, he gave him a faithful ſervant for a conductor, fitted him out with every convenience, ſlipped a purſe of gold into one hand, and a letter into another, and thus addreſſed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"My dear youth, I could with much pleaſure detain you longer in my humble manſion, but I feel your impatience to reviſit your friends, and I am ſenſible that it would be cruelty to deprive them longer than neceſſary of the joy they will receive in recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you. Deign to accept this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for your voyage, and deliver this letter to your father. <hi>He</hi> probably may recollect ſomewhat of me, though you are too young to do ſo. Farewell! I ſhall not ſoon forget you, and I

will hope you will not forget me."</q> 
                  <hi>Adorno</hi> poured out the effuſions of a grateful and affectionate heart, and they parted with mutual tears and embraces.</p>
               <p>The young man had a proſperous voyage home; and the tranſport with which he was again beheld by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt heart-broken parents may more eaſily be conceived than deſcribed. After learning that he had been a captive in Tunis (for it was ſuppoſed that the ſhip in which he ſailed had foundered at ſea), <q rend="inline">"And to whom,"</q> (ſaid old <hi>Adorno</hi>) <q rend="inline">"am I indebted for the ineſtimable benefit of reſtoring you to my arms?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"This letter,"</q> (ſaid his ſon) <q rend="inline">"will inform you."</q> He opened it, and read as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"That ſon of a vile mechanic, who told you that one day you might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the ſcorn with which you treated him, has the ſatisfaction of ſeeing his prediction accompliſhed. For know,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0191002605:89"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adorno</hi> dropt the letter, and covered his face with his hand, while his ſon was diſplaying in the warmeſt language of gratitude the virtues of <hi>Uberto,</hi> and the truly paternal kindneſs he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced from him. As the debt could not be cancelled, <hi>Adorno</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved if poſſible to repay it. He made ſuch powerful interceſſion with the other nobles, that the ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on <hi>Uberto</hi> was reverſed, and full permiſſion given him to return to Genoa. In apprizing him of this event, <hi>Adorno</hi> expreſſed his ſenſe of the obligations he lay under to him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the genuine nobleneſs of his character, and requeſted his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <hi>Uberto</hi> returned to his country, and cloſed his days in peace, with the univerſal eſteem of his fellow-citizens.</p>

               <head>TRUE HEROISM.</head>
               <p>YOU have read, my Edmund, the ſtories of Achilles, and Alexander, and Charles of Sweden, and have, I doubt not, admired that high courage which ſeemed to ſet them above all ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of fear, and rendered them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the moſt extraordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The world calls theſe men <hi>heroes;</hi> but before we give them that noble appellation, let us conſider what were the motives which animated them to act and ſuffer as they did.</p>
               <p>The firſt was a ferocious ſavage, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the paſſions of anger and revenge, in gratifying which he diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded all impulſes of duty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. The ſecond was intoxicated with the love of glory—ſwollen with abſurd pride—and enſlaved by diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute pleaſures; and in purſuit of theſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0191002605:91"/>
objects he reckoned the blood of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions as of no account. The third was unfeeling, obſtinate, and tyrannical, and preferred ruining his country, and ſacrificing all his faithful followers, to the humiliation of giving up any of his mad projects. <hi>Self,</hi> you ſee, was the ſpring of all their conduct; and a <hi>ſelfiſh man</hi> can never be a hero. I will give you two examples of genuine he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm, one ſhown in acting, the other in ſuffering; and theſe ſhall be <hi>true ſtories,</hi> which is perhaps more than can be ſaid of half that is recorded of Achilles and Alexander.</p>
               <p>You have probably heard ſomething of Mr. Howard, the reformer of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom a monument is juſt erected in St. Paul's church. His whole life almoſt was heroiſm; for he confronted all ſorts of dangers with the ſole view of relieving the miſeries of his fellow-creatures. When he began to examine the ſtate of priſons, ſcarcely
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0191002605:92"/>
any in this country was free from a very fatal and infectious diſtemper called the gaol-fever. Wherever he heard of it, he made a point of ſeeing the poor ſufferers, and often went down into their dungeons when the keepers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would not accompany him. He travelled ſeveral times over almoſt the whole of Europe, and even into Aſia, in order to gain knowledge of the ſtate of priſons and hoſpitals, and point out means for leſſening the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that prevail in them. He even went into countries where the plague was, that he might learn the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of treating that terrible conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſe; and he voluntarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to perform a ſtrict qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantine, as one ſuſpected of having the infection of the plague, only that he might be thoroughly acquainted with the methods uſed for prevention. He at length died of a fever caught in attending on the ſick, on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0191002605:93"/>
of Crim Tartary, honoured and admired by all Europe, after having greatly contributed to enlighten his own and many other countries with reſpect to ſome of the moſt important objects of humanity. Such was <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Good;</hi> as great a hero in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving mankind, as ſome of the falſe heroes above-mentioned were in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroving them.</p>
               <p>My ſecond hero is a much humbler, but not leſs genuine one.</p>
               <p>There was a journeyman bricklayer in this town—an able workman, but a very drunken idle fellow, who ſpent at the alehouſe almoſt all he earned, and left his wife and children to ſhift for themſelves as they could. This is, unfortunately, a common caſe; and of all the tyranny and cruelty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the world, I believe that of bad huſbands and fathers is by much the moſt frequent and the worſt.</p>
               <p>The family might have ſtarved, but
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0191002605:94"/>
for his eldeſt ſon, whom from a child the father brought up to help him in his work; and who was ſo induſtrious and attentive, that being now at the age of thirteen or fourteen, he was able to earn pretty good wages, every farthing of which, that he could keep out of his father's hands, he brought to his mother. And when his brute of a father came home drunk, curſing and ſwearing, and in ſuch an ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that his mother and the reſt of the children durſt not come near him for fear of a beating, this good lad, (<hi>Tom</hi> was his name) kept near him, to pacify him, and get him quietly to bed. His mother, therefore, juſty looked upon <hi>Tom</hi> as the ſupport of the family, and loved him dearly.</p>
               <p>It chanced that one day, <hi>Tom,</hi> in climbing up a high ladder with a load of mortar on his head, miſſed his hold, and fell down to the bottom on a heap of bricks and rubbiſh. The byſtanders
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0191002605:95"/>
ran up to him and found him all bloody, and with his thigh broken and bent quite under him. They raiſed him up, and ſprinkled water in his face to recover him from a ſwoon in which he had fallen. As ſoon as he could ſpeak, looking round, with a lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tone, he cried, <q rend="inline">"O, what will become of my poor mother?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was carried home. I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent while the ſurgeon ſet his thigh. His mother was hanging over him half diſtracted. <q rend="inline">"Don't cry, mother!

               <p>
                  <hi>Tom</hi> was a ragged boy that could not read or write—yet <hi>Tom</hi> has always ſtood on my liſt of heroes.</p>

                  <p>That's well. Though we may live in log houſes at firſt, we ſhall want brick or ſtone work for chimneys, and hearths, and ovens, ſo there will

Pennſylvania, followed that plan; and when the Indians were at war with all the other European ſettlers, a perſon in a quaker's habit might paſs through all their moſt ferocious tribes without the leaſt injury.

               <head>THE TRAVELLED ANT.</head>
               <p>THERE was a garden encloſed with high brick walls, and laid out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the old faſhion. Under the walls were wide beds planted with flowers, garden-ſtuff, and fruit-trees. Next to them was a broad gravel walk running round the garden; and the middle was laid out in graſs-plots, and beds of flowers and ſhrubs, with a fiſh-pond in the centre.</p>
               <p>Near the root of one of the wall fruit-trees, a numerous colony of ants was eſtabliſhed, which had extended its ſubterraneous works over great part of the bed in its neighbourhood. One day, two of the inhabitants meeting in a gallery under ground, fell into the following converſation.</p>
               <p>Ha! my friend, (ſaid the firſt) is it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0191002605:107"/>
you? I am glad to ſee you. Where have you been this long time? All your acquaintance have been in pain about you, leſt ſome accident ſhould have befallen you.</p>
               <p>Why, (replied the other) I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſort of ſtranger, for you muſt know I am but juſt returned from a long journey.</p>
               <p>A journey! whither, pray, and on what account?</p>
               <p>A tour of mere curioſity. I had long felt diſſatisfied with knowing ſo little about this world of ours; ſo, at length, I took a reſolution to explore it. And, I may now boaſt that I have gone round its utmoſt extremities, and that no conſiderable part of it has eſcaped my reſearches.</p>
               <p>Wonderful! What a traveller you have been, and what ſights you muſt have ſeen!</p>
               <p>Why, yes—I have ſeen more than
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0191002605:108"/>
moſt ants, to be ſure; but it has been at the expence of ſo much toil and danger, that I know not whether it was worth the pains.</p>
               <p>Would you oblige me with ſome account of your adventures?</p>
               <p>Willingly. I ſet out, then, early one ſunſhiny morning; and, after croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our territory and the line of plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by which it is bordered, I came upon a wide open plain, where, as far as the eye could reach, not a ſingle green thing was to be deſcried, but the hard ſoil was every where covered with huge ſtones, which made travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling equally painful to the eye and the feet. As I was toiling onwards, I heard a rumbling noiſe behind me, which became louder and louder. I looked back, and with the utmoſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror beheld a prodigious rolling moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain approaching me ſo faſt, that it was impoſſible to get out of the way. I threw myſelf flat on the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0191002605:109"/>
a ſtone, and lay expecting nothing but preſent death. The mountain ſoon paſſed over me, and I continued, I know not how long, in a ſtate of inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. When I recovered, I began to ſtretch my limbs one by one, and to my ſurpriſe found myſelf not in the leaſt injured; but the ſtone beſide me was almoſt buried in the earth by the craſh!</p>
               <p>What an eſcape!</p>
               <p>A wonderful one, indeed. I journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on over the deſart, and at length came to the end of it, and entered upon a wide green tract, conſiſting chiefly of tall, narrow, pointed leaves, which grew ſo thick and entangled, that it was with the greateſt difficulty I could make my way between them; and I ſhould continually have loſt my road, had I not taken care to keep the ſun in view before me. When I had got near the middle of this region, I was ſtartled with ſight huge four-legged
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0191002605:110"/>
monſter, with a yellow ſpeckled ſkin, which took a flying leap directly over me. Somewhat further, before I was aware, I ran upon one of thoſe long, round, crawling creatures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out head, tail, or legs, which we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meet with under ground near our ſettlement. As ſoon as he felt me upon him, he drew back into his hole ſo ſwiftly, that he was near drawing me in along with him. However, I jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, and proceeded on my way.</p>
               <p>With much labour I got at laſt to the end of this perplexed tract, and came to an open ſpace like that in which we live, in the midſt of which grew trees ſo tall that I could not ſee to their tops. Being hungry, I climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the firſt I came to, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of finding ſome fruit; but after a weary ſearch I returned empty. I tried ſeveral others with no better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. There were, indeed, leaves and flowers in plenty, but nothing of which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0191002605:111"/>
I could make a meal; ſo that I might have been famiſhed, had I not found ſome ſour harſh berries upon the ground, on which I made a poor repaſt. While I was doing this, a greater danger than any of the former befel me. One of thoſe two-legged feathered creatures which we often ſee to our coſt, jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down from a bough, and picked up in his enormous beak the very berry on which I was ſtanding. Luckily he did not ſwallow it immediately, but flew up again with it to the tree; and in the mean time I diſengaged myſelf, and fell from a vaſt height to the ground, but received no hurt.</p>
               <p>I croſſed this plantation, and came to another entangled green, like the firſt. After I had laboured through it, I came on a ſudden to the ſide of a vaſt glittering plain, the nature of which I could not poſſibly gueſs at. I walked along a fallen leaf which lay on the ſide, and coming to the farther
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0191002605:112"/>
edge of it, I was greatly ſurprized to ſee another ant coming from below to meet me. I advanced to give him a fraternal embrace, but inſtead of what I expected, I met a cold yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter, in which I ſhould have ſunk, had I not ſpeedily turned about, and caught hold of the leaf, by which I drew myſelf up again. And now I found this great plain to conſiſt of that fluid which ſometimes falls from the ſky, and cauſes us ſo much trouble by filling our holes.</p>
               <p>As I ſtood conſidering how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on my journey, a gentle breeze aroſe, which, before I was aware, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the leaf I was upon away from the ſolid land into this yielding fluid, which, however, bore it up, and me along with it. At firſt, I was greatly alarmed, and ran round and round my leaf in order to find ſome way of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting back; but perceiving this to be impracticable, I reſigned myſelf to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0191002605:113"/>
my fate, and even began to take ſome pleaſure in the eaſy motion by which I was borne forwards. But what new and wonderful forms of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did I ſee inhabiting this liquid land! Bodies of prodigious bulk, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſhining ſcales of various colours, ſhot by me with vaſt rapidity, and ſported a thouſand ways. They had large heads, and ſtaring eyes, tremendous wide mouths, but no legs; and they ſeemed to be carried on by the action of ſomewhat like ſmall wings planted on various parts of their body, and eſpecially at the end of the tail, which continually waved about. Other ſmaller creatures, of a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of extraordinary forms, were moving through the clear fluid, or reſting upon its ſurface; and I ſaw with terror numbers of them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeized and ſwallowed by the larger ones before mentioned.</p>
               <p>When I had got near the middle,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0191002605:114"/>
the ſmooth ſurface of this plain was all roughened and moved up and down, ſo as to toſs about my leaf, and nearly overſet it. I trembled to think what would become of me ſhould I be thrown amidſt all theſe terrible mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. At laſt, however, I got ſafe to the other ſide, and with joy ſet my feet on dry land again. I aſcended a gentle green ſlope, which led to a tall plantation like that I had before paſſed through. Another green plain, and another ſtony deſart, ſucceeded; which brought me at length to the oppoſite boundary of our world, encloſed by the ſame immenſe mound riſing to the heavens, which limits us on this ſide.</p>
               <p>Here I fell in with another nation of our ſpecies, differing little in way of life from ourſelves. They invited me to their ſettlement, and entertained me hoſpitably, and I accompanied them in ſeveral excurſions in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. There was a charming fruit-tree
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0191002605:115"/>
at no great diſtance, to which we made frequent viſits. One day, as I was regaling deliciouſly in the heart of a green-gage plum, I felt myſelf all on a ſudden carried along with great ſwiftneſs, till I got into a dark place, where a horrid craſh threw me upon a ſoft moiſt piece of fleſh, whence I was ſoon driven forth in a torrent of wind and moiſture, and found myſelf on the ground all covered with ſlime. I diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged myſelf with difficulty, and looking up, deſcried one of thoſe enormous two-legged animals, which often ſhake the ground over our heads, and put us into terror.</p>
               <p>My new friends now began to hint to me that it was time to depart, for you know we are not fond of natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing ſtrangers. And lucky, indeed, it was for me that I received the hint when I did; for I had but juſt left the place, and was travelling over a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring eminence, when I heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0191002605:116"/>
hind me a tremendous noiſe; and looking back, I ſaw the whole of their ſettlement blown into the air with a prodigious exploſion of fire and ſmoke. Numbers of half-burnt bodies, together with the ruins of their habitations, were thrown to a vaſt diſtance around; and ſuch a ſuffocating vapour aroſe, that I lay for ſome time deprived of ſenſe and motion. From ſome of the wretched fugitives I learned that the diſaſter was attributed to ſubterranean fire burſting its way to the ſurface; the cauſe of which, however, was ſuppoſed to be connected with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of that malignant two-leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged monſter from whoſe jaws I had ſo narrowly eſcaped, who had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved juſt before the exploſion to pour through the holes leading to the great apartment of the ſettlement, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of black ſhining grains.</p>
               <p>On my return from this remote country, I kept along the boundary
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0191002605:117"/>
wall, which I knew by obſervation muſt at length bring me back to my own home. I met with ſeveral wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering tribes of our ſpecies in my road, and frequently joined their foraging par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in ſearch of food. One day, a company of us, allured by the ſmell of ſomewhat ſweet, climbed up ſome lofty pillars, on which was placed a vaſt round edifice, having only one entrance. At this were continually coming in and going out thoſe winged animals, ſomewhat like ourſelves in form, but many times bigger, and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a dreadful ſting, which we ſo often meet with ſipping the juices of flowers; but whether they were the architects of this great manſion, or it was built for them by ſome beneficent being of greater powers, I am unable to decide. It ſeemed, however, to be the place where they depoſited what they ſo induſtriouſly collect; for they were perpetually arriving loaded with a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0191002605:118"/>
ſubſtance, which they carried in, and they returned empty. We had a great deſire to enter with them, but were deterred by their formidable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and a kind of angry hum which continually proceeded from the houſe. At length, two or three of the boldeſt of our party, watching a time when the entrance was pretty free, ventured to go in; but we ſoon ſaw them driven out in great haſte, and trampled down and maſſacred juſt in the gate-way. The reſt of us made a ſpeedy retreat.</p>
               <p>Two more adventures which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me, had very nearly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my return to my own country. Having one evening, together with a companion, taken up my quarters in an empty ſnail-ſhell, there came on ſuch a ſhower of rain in the night, that the ſhell was preſently filled. I awaked juſt ſuffocated; but luckily, having my head turned towards the mouth of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0191002605:119"/>
the ſhell, I roſe to the top, and made a ſhift to crawl to a dry place. My companion, who had got further into the ſhell, never roſe again.</p>
               <p>Not long after, as I was travelling under the wall, I deſcried a curious pit, with a circular orifice, gradually growing narrower to the bottom. On coming cloſe to the brink in order to ſurvey it, the edge, which was of fine ſand, gave way, and I ſlid down the pit. As ſoon as I had reached the bottom, a creature with a huge pair of horns and dreadful claws made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance from beneath the ſand, and attempted to ſeize me. I flew back, and ran up the ſide of the pit; when he threw over me ſuch a ſhower of ſand, as blinded me, and had like to have brought me down again. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by exerting all my ſtrength, I got out of his reach, and did not ceaſe running till I was at a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. I was afterwards informed that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0191002605:120"/>
this was the den of an ant-lion, a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible foe of our ſpecies, which not equalling us in ſpeed, is obliged to make uſe of this crafty device to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap his heedleſs prey.</p>
               <p>This was the laſt of my perils. To my great joy I reached my native place laſt night, where I mean to ſtay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for the future. I do not know how far I have benefited from my travels, but one important concluſion I have drawn from them.</p>
               <p>What is that? (ſaid his friend.)</p>
               <p>Why, you know it is the current opinion with us, that every thing in this world was made for our uſe. Now, I have ſeen ſuch vaſt tracts not at all fit for our reſidence, and peopled with creatures ſo much larger and ſtronger than ourſelves, that I cannot help be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced that the Creator had in view their accommodation as well as ours, in making this world.</p>
               <p>I confeſs this ſeems probable enough;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0191002605:121"/>
but you had better keep your opinion to yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Why ſo?</p>
               <p>You know we ants are a vain race, and make high pretenſions to wiſdom as well as antiquity. We ſhall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with any attempts to leſſen our importance in our own eyes.</p>
               <p>But there is no wiſdom in being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>Well—do as you think proper. Meantime, farewell, and thanks for the entertainment you have given me.</p>
               <p>Farewell!</p>

               <head>SHOW AND USE; OR, THE TWO PRESENTS.</head>
               <p>ONE morning, Lord Richmore, coming down to breakfaſt, was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed with the tidings that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0191002605:122"/>
mare, Miſs Slim, had brought a foal, and alſo, that a ſhe-aſs kept for his lady's uſe as a milker, had dropt a young one. His lordſhip ſmiled at the inequality of the preſents nature had made him. <q rend="inline">"As for the foal (ſaid he to the groom) that, you know, has been long promiſed to my neighbour Mr. Scamper. For young Balaam, you may diſpoſe of him as you pleaſe."</q> The groom thanked his lordſhip, and ſaid he would then give him to Iſaac the woodman.</p>
               <p>In due time, Miſs Slim's foal, which was the ſon of a noted racer, was taken to Squire Scamper's, who received him with great delight, and out of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the donor named him <hi>Young Peer.</hi> He was brought up with at leaſt as much care and tenderneſs as the Squire's own children—kept in a warm ſtable, fed with the beſt of corn and hay, duly dreſſed, and regularly exerciſed. As he grew up, he gave
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0191002605:123"/>
tokens of great beauty. His colour was bright bay, with a white ſtar on his forehead; his coat was fine, and ſhone like ſilk; and every point about him ſeemed to promiſe perfection of ſhape and make. Every body admired him as the completeſt colt that could be ſeen.</p>
               <p>So fine a creature could not be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to any uſeful employment. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had paſſed his third year, he was ſent to Newmarket to be trained for the turf, and a groom was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the care of him alone. His maſter, who could not well afford the expence, ſaved part of it by turning off a domeſtic tutor whom he kept for the education of his ſons, and was content with ſending them to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of the pariſh.</p>
               <p>At four years old, Young Peer ſtarted for a ſubſcription purſe, and came in ſecond out of a number of competitors. Soon after, he won a country plate, and filled his maſter
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0191002605:124"/>
with joy and triumph. The Squire now turned all his attention to the turf, made matches, betted high, and was at firſt tolerably ſucceſsful. At length, having ventured all the money he could raiſe upon one grand match, Young Peer ran on the wrong ſide of the poſt, was diſtanced, and the ſquire ruined.</p>
               <p>Meantime young Balaam went into Iſaac's poſſeſſion, where he had a very different training. He was left to pick up his living as he could in the lanes and commons; and on the coldeſt days in winter he had no other ſhelter than the lee ſide of the cottage, out of which he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten glad to pluck the thatch for a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. As ſoon as ever he was able to bear a rider, Iſaac's children got upon him, ſometimes two or three at once; and if he did not go to their mind, a broomſtick or bunch of furze was freely applied to his hide. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0191002605:125"/>
he grew up, as the children themſelves did, ſtrong and healthy; and though he was rather bare on the ribs, his ſhape was good and his limbs vigorous.</p>
               <p>It was not long before his maſter thought of putting him to ſome uſe; ſo, taking him to the wood, he faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a load of faggots on his back, and ſent him with his ſon Tom to the next town. Tom ſold the faggots, and mounting upon Balaam, rode him home. As Iſaac could get plenty of faggots and chips, he found it a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable trade to ſend them for daily ſale upon Balaam's back. Having a little garden, which from the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoil yielded him nothing of value, he bethought him of loading Balaam back from town with dung for manure. Though all he could bring at once was contained in two ſmall panniers, yet this in time amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enough to mend the ſoil of his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0191002605:126"/>
whole garden, ſo that he grew very good cabbages and potatoes, to the great relief of his family. Iſaac, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſenſible of the value of his aſs, began to treat him with more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. He got a ſmall ſtack of ruſhy hay for his winter fodder, and with his own hands built him a little ſhed of boughs and mud in order to ſhelter him from the bad weather. He would not ſuffer any of his family to uſe Balaam ill, and after his daily journies he was allowed to ramble at pleaſure. He was now and then clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dreſſed, and, upon the whole, made a reputable figure. Iſaac took in more land from the waſte, ſo that by degrees he became a little farmer, and kept a horſe and cart, a cow, and two or three pigs. This made him quite a rich man; but he had always the gratitude to impute his proſperity to the good ſervices of Balaam, the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0191002605:127"/>
groom's preſent; while the ſquire curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Young Peer as the cauſe of his ruin, and many a time wiſhed that his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had kept his dainty gift to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Theſe things would be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous enough to you, I do not doubt, becauſe you have been accuſtomed to a very different way of living.

                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>All the children but the two youngeſt can read a little, Sir; but Meg, there, is the beſt ſcholar among

                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                  <p>I do, Sir. Here's an alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack, too, againſt the wall; and here are my favourite ballads of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Wood, and Chevy-chace.</p>

                  <p>I let the children paſte them up, Sir, and a few more that have no harm in them. There's Hearts of Oak, and Rule Britannia, and Robin Gray.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. E.</speaker>
                  <p>A very good choice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. I ſee you have a pretty garden there behind the houſe.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>It is only a little ſpot, Sir; but it ſerves for ſome amuſement, and uſe too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                  <p>What beautiful ſtocks and wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers! We have none ſo fine in our garden.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, maſter, to ſay the truth, we are rather proud of them. I have got a way of cultivating them that I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0191002605:135"/>
believe few beſides myſelf are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; and on Sundays I have plenty of viſitors to come and admire them.</p>

                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>

                  <p>Don't you know? It is roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                  <p>It is good for any thing?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>We like the ſmell of it; and then the leaves, mixed with a little balm, make pleaſant tea, which we ſometimes drink in an afternoon.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                  <p>Here are ſeveral more plants that I never ſaw before.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>Some of them are pot herbs, that we put into our broth or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge; and other are phyſic herbs, for we cannot afford to go to a doctor for every trifling ailment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                  <p>But how did you learn the uſe of theſe things?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, partly, maſter, from an old herbal that I have got; and partly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0191002605:136"/>
from my good mother and ſome old neighbours; for we poor people are obliged to help one another as well as we can. If you were curious about plants, I could go into the fields and ſhow you a great many that we reckon very fine for ſeveral uſes, though I ſuppoſe we don't call them by the proper names.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. E.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir, we have hands enow, and all of us like to be doing a little in it when our in-doors work is over. I am in hopes ſoon to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a bit of land from the waſte for a potato-ground, which will be a great help to us. I ſhall then be able to keep a pig.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Mr. E.</speaker>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0191002605:137"/>
pinched in dear times and hard weather; but, thank God, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant work, and my children begin to be ſome help to us, ſo that we fare better than ſome of our neighbours. If I do but keep my health, I don't fear but we ſhall make a ſhift to live.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. E.</speaker>
                  <p>Keep ſuch a contented mind, my friend, and you will have few to envy. Good morning to you; and if any ſickneſs or accident ſhould befal you, remember you have a friend in your neighbour at the hall.</p>

                  <p>Well, Charles, what do you think of our viſit?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                  <p>I am highly pleaſed with it, Sir. I ſhall have a better opinion of a poor cottager as long as I live.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. E.</speaker>
                  <p>I am glad of it. You ſee, when we compare ourſelves with this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0191002605:138"/>
weaver, all the advantage is not on our ſide. He is poſſeſſed of an art, the utility of which ſecures him a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood whatever may be the changes of the times. All his family are brought up to induſtry, and ſhow no ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in their ſeveral occupations. They are not without inſtruction, and eſpecially ſeem to be in no want of that beſt of all, the knowledge of their duty. They underſtand ſomething of the cultivation and uſes of plants, and are capable of receiving enjoyment from the beauties of nature. They partake of the pleaſures of home and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. Above all, they ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their lot, and free from anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cares and repinings. I view them as truly reſpectable members of ſociety, acting well the part allotted to them, and that, a part moſt of all neceſſary to the well-being of the whole. They may, from untoward accidents, be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0191002605:139"/>
objects of our compaſſion, but they never can of our contempt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, Sir, I am very far from deſpiſing them now. But would it not be poſſible to make them more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable than they are at preſent?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. E.</speaker>
                  <p>I think it would; and when giving a little from the ſuperfluities of perſons in our ſituation, would add ſo much to the happineſs of perſons in theirs, I am of opinion that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable not to do it. I intend to uſe my intereſt to get this poor man the piece of waſte land he wants, and he ſhall have ſome from my ſhare ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than go without.</p>

                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                  <p>And ſuppoſe, Sir, we were to give him ſome good potatoes to plant it?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. E.</speaker>
                  <p>We will. Then, you know, we have a fine ſow that never fails to produce a numerous litter twice a year. Suppoſe we rear one of the next brood
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0191002605:140"/>
to be ready for him as ſoon as he has got his potato-ground into bearing?</p>

                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                  <p>O yes! that will be juſt the thing. But how is he to build a pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtye?</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. E.</speaker>
                  <p>You may leave that to his own ingenuity; I warrant he can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage ſuch a job as that, with the help of a neighbour, at leaſt. Well—I hope both the weaver, and you, will be the better for the acquaintance we have made to day: and always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that, <hi>man, when fulfilling the duties of his ſtation, be that ſtation what it may, is a worthy object of reſpect to his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, I will explain it more at length. There are certain notions that we form in our minds without the help of our eyes, or any of our ſenſes. Thus, Virtue, Vice, Honour, Diſgrace, Time, Death, and the like, are not ſenſible objects, but ideas of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—We cannot feel them or ſee them, but we can think about them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>True. Now it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that we wiſh to repreſent one of theſe in a viſible form; that is, to offer ſomething to the ſight that ſhall raiſe a ſimilar notion in the minds of the beholders. In order to do this, we muſt take ſome action or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance belonging to it, capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0191002605:142"/>
expreſſed by painting or ſculpture; and this is called a <hi>type,</hi> or <hi>emblem.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>But how can this be done?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>I will tell you by an example. You know the Seſſions-houſe where trials are held. It would be eaſy to write over the door, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it, <q rend="inline">"This is the Seſſions-houſe;"</q> but it is a more ingenious and elegant way of pointing it out, to place upon the building a figure repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purpoſe for which it was erected, namely, to diſtribute <hi>juſtice.</hi> For this end, the notion of juſtice is to be <hi>perſonified,</hi> that is, changed from an idea of the underſtanding into one of the ſight. A human figure is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made, diſtinguiſhed by tokens which bear a relation to the character of that virtue. Juſtice carefully <hi>weighs</hi> both ſides of a cauſe; ſhe is therefore repreſented as holding a <hi>pair of ſcales.</hi> It is her office to <hi>puniſh</hi> crimes; ſhe therefore bears a <hi>ſword.</hi> This is then
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0191002605:143"/>
an <hi>emblematical figure,</hi> and the ſword and ſcales are <hi>emblems.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                  <p>I underſtand this very well. But why is ſhe blindfolded?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>To denote her impartiality—that ſhe decides only from the merits of the caſe, and not from a view of the parties.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>How can ſhe weigh anything, though, when her eyes are blinded?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Well objected. Theſe are two inconſiſtent emblems; each proper in itſelf, but when uſed together, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a contradictory action. An artiſt of judgment will therefore drop one of them; and accordingly the beſt modern figures of Juſtice have the balance and ſword, without the bandage over the eyes.</p>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly, or you could not know that it meant Death. How is he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented?</p>

                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe he is all bones, becauſe nothing but bones are left after a dead body has lain long in the grave.</p>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>True. This, however, is not ſo properly an emblem, as the real and viſible effect of death. But the ſcythe?</p>

                  <speaker>C.</speaker>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>It is. No inſtrument could ſo properly repreſent the wide-waſting
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0191002605:145"/>
ſway of death, which ſweeps down the race of animals, like flowers falling under the hand of the mower. It is a ſimile uſed in the ſcriptures.</p>

                  <p>The hour-glaſs, I ſuppoſe, is to ſhow people that their time is come.</p>

                  <p>Right. In the hour-glaſs that Death holds, all the ſand is run out from the upper to the lower part. Have you never obſerved upon a monument an old figure, with wings, and a ſcythe, and with his head bald, all but a ſingle lock before?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>O yes!—and I have been told it is <hi>Time.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Well—and what do you make of it? Why is he old?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>O! becauſe time has laſted a long while.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>And why has he wings?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe time is ſwift, and flies away.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>What does his ſcythe mean?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe that is, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0191002605:146"/>
and cuts down every thing like death.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>True. I think, however, a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon rather ſlower in its operation, as a pick-axe, would have been more ſuitable to the gradual action of time. But what is his ſingle lock of hair for?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>I have been thinking, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it out.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>I thought that would puzzle you. It relates to time as giving <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi> for doing any thing. It is to be ſeized as it preſents itſelf, or it will eſcape, and cannot be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus the proverb ſays, <q rend="inline">"Take time by the fore-lock."</q> Well—now you underſtand what emblems are.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I think I do. I ſuppoſe the painted ſugar-loaves over the grocer's ſhop, and the mortar over the apothecary's, are emblems too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Not ſo properly. They are only the pictures of things which are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0191002605:147"/>
the objects of ſight, as the real ſugar-loaf in the ſhop of the grocer, and the real mortar in that of the apothecary. However, an implement belonging to a particular rank or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, is commonly uſed as an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem to point out the man exerciſing that rank or profeſſion. Thus a crown is conſidered as an emblem of a king; a ſword or ſpear, of a ſoldier; an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, of a ſailor; and the like.</p>

                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>I remember Captain Heartwell, when he came to ſee us, had the figure of an anchor on all his buttons.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>He had. That was the emblem or badge of his belonging to the navy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>But you told me that an emblem was a viſible ſign of an inviſible thing; yet a ſea-captain is not an inviſible thing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>He is not inviſible as a man, but his profeſſion is inviſible.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not well underſtand that.</p>

                  <p>Profeſſion is a <hi>quality,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally to a number of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, however different they may be in external form and appearance. It may be added or taken away without any viſible change. Thus, if Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Heartwell were to give up his commiſſion, he would appear to you the ſame man as before. It is plain, therefore, that what in that caſe he had loſt, namely his profeſſion, was a thing inviſible. It is one of thoſe ideas of the underſtanding which I before mentioned to you, as different from a ſenſible idea.</p>

                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>He is got very high already, but he wants to be ſtill higher; ſo he ventures up the ladder, though it is only ſupported by a cloud, and hangs over a precipice.</p>

                  <p>Yes; you may call him which you pleaſe. But who is this ſower, that ſcatters ſeed in the ground?</p>

                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me conſider. I think there is a parable in the Bible about ſeed ſown, and it there ſignifies ſomething like <hi>Inſtruction.</hi>

                  <p>True; but it may alſo repreſent <hi>Hope,</hi> for no one would ſow without hoping to reap the fruit. What do you think of this candle held before a

                  <p>It repreſents <hi>Truth;</hi> the eſſence of which conſiſts in the fidelity with which objects are received and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back by our minds. The object is here a luminous one, to ſhow the clearneſs and brightneſs of Truth.

                  <p>Yes—or in other words, <hi>Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi> The ſtrength and ſtability of the pillar alſo denotes the ſecurity produced by this virtue. You ſee here a woman diſentangling and reeling off a very perplexed ſkein of thread.</p>

                  <p>True. She is <hi>Patience</hi> herſelf. The brooding hen ſitting beſide her is another emblem of the ſame quality that aids the interpretation. Who do you think this pleaſing female is, that looks with ſuch kindneſs upon the drooping plant ſhe is watering?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>It is; or you may call her <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity,</hi> which is nearly the ſame thing. Here is a lady ſitting demurely, with one finger on her lip, while ſhe holds a bridle in her other hand.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>The finger on the lip I ſuppoſe denotes Silence. The bridle muſt mean Confinement. I could almoſt fancy her to be a School-miſtreſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Ha! ha! I hope, indeed, many ſchool-miſtreſſes are endued with her ſpirit, for ſhe is <hi>Prudence,</hi> or <hi>Diſcretion.</hi> Well—we are now got to the end of our pictures, and upon the whole you have interpreted them very prettily.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>But I have one queſtion to aſk
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0191002605:154"/>
you, papa! In theſe pictures, and others that I have ſeen of the ſame ſort, almoſt all the <hi>good</hi> qualities are repreſented in the form of <hi>women.</hi> What is the reaſon of that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>It is certainly a compliment, my dear, either to your ſex's perſon, or mind. The inventor either choſe the figure of a female to cloath his agreeable quality in, becauſe he thought that the moſt agreeable form, and therefore beſt ſuited to it; or he meant to imply that the female character is really the moſt virtuous and amiable. I rather believe that the firſt was his intention, but I ſhall not object to your taking it in the light of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>But is it true—is it true?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I can give you very good authority for the preference of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſex in a moral view. One Led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, a great traveller, who had walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through almoſt all the countries of
