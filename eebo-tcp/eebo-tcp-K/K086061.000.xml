            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVERY one who amuſes himſelf with writing Works of Imagination, has a View to either Profit or Fame. Though the Author of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Trifles does not pretend to be above ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, yet he hopes his Anxiety is not powerful enough to render him unhappy one Moment, ſhould he be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſappointed. He is ſenſible how much Succeſs depends upon Circumſtances. A Poem muſt be read before it can be admired; nay more, it muſt be read with ſome Share of that Temper and Spirit in which it was written, or it will appear languid. A good Character, or a bad one, given by thoſe Gentlemen
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1003600100:3"/>who take upon themſelves the Office of Public Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in literary Matters, will frequently, at leaſt for a Time, determine its Fate. As he is entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, he is not in any Dread of a partial Sentence. If theſe Poems are worthleſs, let them reſt in that Oblivion which is the utmoſt Happineſs Unworthineſs can know: if the contrary happens to be the Caſe, he has no doubt but their Merits will be ſeen and acknowledged by every one whom Heaven has bleſt with Taſte and Judgment ſufficient to form the true Critic.</p>

                  <p>THERE is not any Thing, I believe, which calls forth the melancholy and ſympathetic Paſſions more forcibly than a Sight of thoſe Men who have once been great or famous, and have outlived their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or Faculties. Who can forbear ſighing when he beholds a BELISARIUS? Whoſe Heart is not wrung when he views a SWIFT in his Dotage?—Reflections of this Kind gave Birth to the following Stanzas. They were written upon an old Man in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Village, whoſe Strength, Activity, and ruſtic Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, were once the frequent Admiration of his Fellow-Swains; and when Age had deprived
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1003600100:16"/>him of them, and rendered him feeble and decrepid, the Remembrance of his paſt Exploits was often the Subject of their Exclamations, and the honeſt Motive of their Pity and Condolence, as well as the frequent Topic of his own Lamentation. The Effect that this Remembrance had upon his Mind cannot, perhaps, be conveyed more feelingly than by informing the Reader that the Sentence which I have choſen for a Motto was common in his Mouth, and generally attended with a Sigh.</p>
