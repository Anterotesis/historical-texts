            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>SO various and complicated are the
ſcenes of this life, that ſeven years
have elapſed ſince the following pages
were written, a period, perhaps, more
favourable for publiſhing than the
preſent; but timidity, or other hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
have repeatedly prevented their
appearing before the public; during
which time the author hoped ſome more
able advocate would have taken up the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0803200700:5"/>
cauſe, to do juſtice to a ſubject of ſuch
importance to ſociety at large, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
a much injured part thereof.
For, alas! it is too well known, that
female education, in general, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
within very narrow limits, and
ſeldom permitted to extend to claſſical
accompliſhments. The writer of this
volume being a female, with only a
female's education, is ſufficiently aware
of her inadequacy to the undertaking,
but truſts the importance of the ſubject
will claim ſome attention ; at the ſame
time, repoſing a full confidence in the
candour and unbounded goodneſs of
ſome part of her readers at leaſt, ſhe
is once more encouraged to reſume the
pen, to add, or amend ſuch remarks as
the nature of the times and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanccs
require, and, at length, has ſo far
ſurmounted her timidity, as to ſubmit
the following ſheets, with all their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0803200700:6"/>
perfections, to the inſpection of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
public, who are more ready to
appreciate the works of individuals
from the rectitude of intention, than
the beauty of compoſition. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
ſhe muſt acknowledge, has coſt
her many a painful emotion ; for a firſt
attempt, ſurrounded by all the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
peculiar to the ſex, ſeems, to
her, to require no ſmall ſhare of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and which, indeed, nothing but
the importance of the ſubject ſhould
have induced her to encounter.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of the following pages
is an attempt to delineate the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe poor, helpleſs, females
whoſe ſufferings, from a variety of
cauſes, are too grievous to be borne;
the ſources and dire conſequences of
which the exalted in life cannot form
the leaſt conception, unleſs they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend
to examine for themſelves,
when, it is to be hoped, their griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0803200700:7"/>
will be ſought into and redreſſed.
The munificence of the people of Great
Britain, which is ever ready and adequate
to the ſupport, aid, and comfort, of the
afflicted, when their troubles are fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigated;
and the great number of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
women, who, doubtleſs, would
rejoice to become virtuous and uſeful
members of ſociety, in ſome lawful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
have encouraged the author
to offer this feeble repreſentation. Nor
can ſhe deſpair of eventual ſucceſs to
the cauſe ſhe has engaged in, if ſhe is
but ſo happy as to excite the attention
of thoſe whoſe ſouls are enlarged with
the exalted ideas of Chriſtian charity.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it is a work which, as a duty
to our fellow creatures, ſhe has long,
very long, wiſhed to ſee executed by a
more able pen; but the ſilence of others,
the liberality of a generous public, and
a moſt ardent wiſh to ſee miſcry allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0803200700:8"/>
and virtuous induſtry crowned
with abundant ſucceſs, have been the
principal motives to her engaging in ſo
arduous an undertaking. Conſcious,
however, that whatever good may be
the reſult, the praiſe alone is due to
the benevolent principles of humanity.</p>
            <p>The author, at the ſame time, wiſhes
it to be underſtood, that ſhe has not
been ſtimulated, from vain and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
views, to appear in print, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the pure philanthropic mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of throwing in her humble mite
towards the much-wiſhed-for relief of
theſe moſt pitiable objects of diſtreſs;
numbers of whom, from the want of a
fair repreſentation of their caſe, ſhe
greatly fears, are unable to obtain ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under the auſpicious ſhade of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
charity; and, conſequently, are
compelled to ſhare the fate of the
moſt wretched of human beings. She
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0803200700:9"/>
wiſhes to repreſent the caſe of thoſe
who would be induſtrious, if they might,
but are held down by the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
influence of cuſtom and miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation;
and, conſequently, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable,
without the kind aſſiſtance of
humanity, to find redreſs, or even again
to tread the paths of virtue. But, alas!
finding herſelf ſo feeble an advocate, ſhe
can only hold the pen of Truth, whilſt
Reaſon and Juſtice plead their cauſe.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>LET not the fair fame of this country be
tarniſhed with an unnoticed appeal; in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
an appeal of ſuch magnitude as to
involve, at once, the peace, the happineſs,
and the welfare of every individual. The
author's deſign is by no means to contend
for power, but protection for this oppreſſed
people; imagining that to be the ſirmeſt baſis
on which to eſtabliſh the happineſs of both
ſexes.</p>
            <p>It muſt be allowed, however, when cuſtom
has given permanency to any practice, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
evil in its tendency, it is next to impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to effect its removal, or to ſucceed in any
reaſonable claim; therefore I contend not
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0803200700:11"/>
with the lords of the creation, for any other
privilege than that protection, which they
themſelves avow to be the <hi>real rights of
women.</hi> I would not have it underſtood,
that the generality of women, any more than
men, are incapable of acquiring the ſame
degree of knowledge and improvement in
literature; and happy am I to learn, that
this ſtate of prohibition is not general; and
that a claſſical education, in ſome parts, is
not confined to men alone; for, if the author
is not miſinformed, it is upwards of ſeven
years ſince there was an eſtabliſhment formed
in Philadelphia, where youth and innocence
find protection from the guardian genius, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
whoſe emblematical trophy may
very well be formed of Knowledge gaining
the victory over Ignorance.</p>
            <p>But theſe advantages, in Britain, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolized
by the male ſex, permit me to aſk,
if it is not their duty, at leaſt, to afford pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
in their ſlead; for, ſurely, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to protect, they have no right whatever
to govern.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0803200700:12"/>
               <l>"Britons, attend! be worth like this approv'd,</l>
               <l>"And ſhew you have the virtue to be mov'd."</l>
            </q>
            <p>Therefore I am led to keep firmly to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
that it is not power, but protection,
which is required; for the generality of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>natives of this country,</hi> are ſo perfectly
tamed, either through cuſtom or compulſive
ſubmiſſion, that, let but the lenient hand of
protection be ſtretched out to their aid, and,
doubtleſs, content and happineſs will reſume
their ſeat, and cheerfulneſs form the leading
feature, to beſpeak the tranquillity of thoſe
ſouls, which have been ſo long depreſſed.</p>
            <p>All women poſſeſs not the Amazonian ſpirit
of a Wolſtonecraft. But, indeed, unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
oppreſſion is ſometimes a ſufficient apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for their throwing off the gentle garb of
a female, and aſſuming ſome more maſculine
appearance; yet, when the curtain of miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
is once withdrawn, it is to be
hoped, (not donbted) that the cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
will quickly be removed,</p>
            <p>It ſeems, however, very neceſſary to call
in ſome able aſſiſtants, and conſequently I
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0803200700:13"/>
make my appeal to reaſon, juſtice, and truth,
which, in checking the ſpirit of malevolence,
ſhould it rear its hydra head to the prejudice of
the cauſe, will alſo be the means of ſhielding
the writer from the common cenſure which the
narrow-minded, in general, beſtow on a firſt
production.</p>
            <p>A ſerious ſtatement of facts, it is to be
hoped, will be productive of good to great
numbers, who would be happy to relieve
their fellow-creatures, but whoſe exalted ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
in life too generally preclude them the
opportunity of obtaining a knowledge of the
real wants of the wretched, or the cauſes of
their ſufferings; by exhibiting, though feebly,
a complicated picture of miſery and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Yet, it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that
having made my remarks chiefly on real, and
not imaginary grievances, ſhould any thing in
theſe pages do violence to the critical abilities
of any of my readers, whoſe ſuperior educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
exalts them above the level of the interior
ranks of ſociety, it is the writer's requeſt, that
the intention may be kept in remembrance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0803200700:14"/>
Still, methinks, I hear the voice of reaſon
reproaching me, after the many acknowledged
diſadvantages, for attempting to write on a
ſubject of ſuch weighty importance. Indeed,
conſidering the great number of eminent
writers that are daily diſplaying their erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a variety of ſubjects, and in ſtyles ſo
very far ſuperior to my poor abilities, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
were preſumption itſelf. But,
amidſt the abundant ſhew of publications
which are daily uſhered into the world, I have
not ſeen one on a ſubject ſimilar to this.
This alone is the exciting cauſe to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
in which it will be my utmoſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to be the humble means of directing
the tender eye of benevolence to worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of commiſeration; or, inducing ſome
more able advocate to take up the cauſe of a
much-injured and oppreſſed part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, in their journey through life, a
number of my fellow travellers have made the
same obſervations with myſelf, though they
have not made them public; yet, willing to
ſuppoſe <hi>that</hi> ſilence did not proceed from a
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0803200700:15"/>
want of thoſe philanthropic diſpoſitions which
have, at all times, diſtinguiſhed Britons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
will ſuppoſe this great omiſſion, for undoubt
edly great it will appear, when properly in
veſtigated, cannot poſſibly have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
from any other cauſe than the force o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
cuſtom, by which the greateſt part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
have been ſo long hoodwinked; and
thoſe grievances paſſed by in ſilence, of which
I am about to ſpeak. Many excellent chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
this country ſupports, and many worthy
individuals ſeem to exult in ſtepping forward
to the aid of the diſtreſſed ; nor is it to be
doubted, that many more would as cheerfully
contribute in ſupport of the ſtill unfortunate
and oppreſſed, were they made acquainted with
the real objects: but, alas! when keen adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
ſtrikes its pointed dart into the boſom of
the afflicted, the pain is too great to admit of
an explanation ; and when paſt, their only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
is to bury its remembrance in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion:
therefore, unleſs ſome friendly hand take
up the pen, how can thoſe, who are enabled by
fortune and prompted by compaſſion, ſtretch
forth the hand of clemency to diſtreſſes, of which
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0803200700:16"/>
they never heard; or, like the good Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
pour oil into wounds which they never
ſaw. In the mean time, then, let mine be the
painful, though voluntary, taſk; and even,
ſhould the deſign not immediately meet with
the deſired ſucceſs, no doubt, but in a ſhort
time it may, by the kindly interference of the
great, powerful, and humane inveſtigators of
human calamities, to the emancipation of this
oppreſſed part of the human kind.</p>
            <p>At the commencement of the Magdalen
charity, it is true, an objection was ſtarted,
which was founded upon this candid queſtion:
"What will you do with ſuch poor creatures,
when you have them?" But the difficulty
was as ſoon ſolved by Robert Dingley, Eſq.
the firſt humane propoſer of the charity. Nor
is there a doubt, were a ſimilar enquiry to
take place, it would as ſoon be ſolved; for
what undertaking is too bold for man to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
when a reſtoration of happineſs to his
fellow creatures is the object. I ſhall, then,
cheerfully proceed to offer the following ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
hints, which, it is hoped, will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
upon to the good of ſociety.</p>

TRADERS ENGROSSING WOMEN'S
OCCUPATIONS.</head>
            <p>TO detail human miſery in all its various
ſhapes is not in the power of any individual:
ſo complicated and numerous are the ills of
this life, and ſo various its misfortunes, that
we need not have recourſe to the airy regions
of fiction or romance, to find out objects of
diſtreſs, to pourtray the woes of our fellow
creatures; yet, from motives of delicacy,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0803200700:18"/>
beg leave to withhold names, leſt the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
objects ſhould feel hurt at the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
recital of their tale of woe; and
ſhall therefore only ſelect a few inſtances, and
leave the candid moraliſt to take a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
view of the reſt, through all the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
mazes and wide tracts, to which a part of
our fellow mortals have been condemned.—And
by what? not by divine law, which is,
or ought to be, the ſtanding rule of all our
action, but by an evil precedent, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to fall with all its force upon that part of
the community, whoſe feeble powers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
joined to an habitual paſſive ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
are the leaſt able to defend them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
it has never yet been thought a
buſineſs worth inveſtigation, although ſo many
others, of much leſs moment, have been
ſought out, and redreſſed.</p>
            <p>When we look around us, nothing is more
conſpicuous in the eyes of the world, than
the diſtreſſes of women. I do not ſay thoſe
whom a kind Providence hath placed under
the immediate care of a tender father, or an
affectionate and kind huſband; or, <hi>by chance,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0803200700:19"/>
a friend, or brother. But theſe, alas! com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
only one part of the community. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all are of the ſame nature, and
were formed by the ſame Divine Power, yet
their comforts differ very widely indeed. Still,
as women ſeem formed by nature to ſeek pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
from man, why, in the name of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
refuſe the boon? Does it not become
highly worthy the attention of men in general,
to conſider in what manner to redreſs the
grievances <hi>already within their notice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be ſaid, and very juſtly,
that, conſidering human frailty, there is
amongſt women, as well as men, a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of vicious and undeſerving. Granted;
ſtill, is it not better to paſs over a hundred
guilty, than let puniſhment fall upon one
innocent perſon?—Beſides, IS THERE NOT
A POSSIBILITY OF FORMING A PLAN OF
DISCRIMINATION, FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THOSE ONLY WHO MERIT SUCH HUMANE
AND FRIENDLY INTERFERENCE?</p>
            <p>Some years ago, who would have been
made believe, ſo many perſons could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to life, as the Royal Humane Society,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0803200700:20"/>
for the recovering of drowned perſons, has
effected? Yet ſo it is; which proves to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
the practicability of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
But before I proceed with my Hint for
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ecting any eſtabliſhed plan, for the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of peace and happineſs to the, perhaps,
once happy, but now moſt miſerable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
I cannot help making a remark, that,
in order to lay a good foundation, every
builder muſt find it neceſſary, firſt, to remove
the rubbiſh out of his way—So let us proceed
to the ground-work of the deſign; and. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any further ſleps are taken, aſk, What

and men ſtay-makers? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all the numerous train of other proſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
ſuch as hair-dreſſers, &amp;c. &amp;c.; all of
which occupations are much more calculated
for women than men. But, thanks to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions
of the times, for once, which have near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exploded that diſgraceful cuſtom of men
dreſſing ladies' hair, by the introduction of
all the brutuſes and chignons, of every deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
which have found their way to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0803200700:21"/>
Where is there a Stevens now? was there
ever a wider field for the diſplay of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents?
Yet, if perukes are the faſhion of the
day, what is to prevent a woman from diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her taſte upon a lady's head as well as a
man, who ſeems much better calculated for a
more maſculine employment.</p>
            <p>"Look," ſays an obſerver, "to the ſhops
of perfumers, toymen, and others of a ſimilar
occupation; and, above all, look to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdaſhery
magazines, where from ten to
twenty fellows, ſix feet high, may be counted
in each, to the utter excluſion of poor females,
who could ſell a tooth-pick, or a few ribbons,
juſt as well."</p>
            <p>A tax upon theſe fellows would be very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary,
ſo ſay I ; yet, for a poor female indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
to attack ſo numerous a body of men,
however inſignificant by cuſtom, is a bold
ſtroke, no doubt; yet, having thrown theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
together, in defence of the oppreſſed,
even the cenſure of malevolence itſelf <hi>will</hi>
not prevent the truth, which, like a huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
whip, cannot give pain to any <hi>but</hi> thoſe
it touches : for, as no rule can be eſtabliſhed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0803200700:22"/>
without exceptions, ſo in this caſe more than
one muſt be granted, which ſhall be treated
of in a ſubſequent part of theſe pages. To
claſs the innocent with the guilty would be
doing injuſtice to the cauſe.</p>
            <p>But, in the mean time, where are theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
huſbands, brothers, and profeſſed friends
to virtue and happineſs, who ſtep not forward
in the buſineſs? No doubt but there are many
men of great probity and humanity, and yet,
through the progreſſive courſe of cuſtom,
have not adverted <hi>either</hi> to the cauſe or its
fatal conſequences; or, in fine, are not aware
of the real diſtreſſes of our fellow-creatures;
from which idea it is ſo frequently wiſhed a
reference to facts may take place, ſince neither
the ſufferings of theſe poor women, nor the
cauſe of their ſufferings can poſſibly be known,
but by inveſtigation.</p>
            <p>It is not to be ſuppoſed but all, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
ſhare the: common misfortunes in life;
and few there are, however wretched their
ſituations, who cannot ſingle out other beings
as bad, if not in a more deplorable ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0803200700:23"/>
But, in the caſe of theſe poor women, where
is there a ſtate nearly equal to theirs? borne
down by fate's afflicting hand, they are not
able to act, or ſeck redreſs; and this, by the
unfeeling part of the world, we have too great
reaſon to fear, is termed idleneſs and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy.</p>
            <p>What a littleneſs of mind ! what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling
and deſpicable meanneſs muſt lurk in
the breaſts of thoſe, who can, with impunity,
inſult over diſtreſs! Into what fits of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have numbers of helpleſs females fallen
through theſe contemptible inſults and revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and even neglects! for, it is in thoſe
dark moments of diſtreſs, when the ſenſes are
all alive to the fine feelings of nature, that
every nerve is relaxed and ready to receive
the fatal dart.</p>
            <p>Then indeed it is, that ſhe ſtands expoſed in
the field of adverſity, ſurrounded by every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
without the aid of education, or the
guardian hand of protection; that is to ſay,
without either weapon or ſhield of defence: a
ſituation which, it is natural to ſuppoſe, would
draw pity from the moſt obdurate hearts. Yet,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0803200700:24"/>
how many are the inſtances of the cenſorious
part of the creation, daſtardly and cruelly
aſſaſſinating and murdering the character of
theſe poor unfortunate victims, and thoſe of
all murderers are the worſt under heaven.
The common and detected murderer ſtands
expoſed to the laws of his country, but the
aſſaſſin, who, under a cloak of hypocriſy,
can perſecute and deſame the characters of
oppreſſed females, are no longer worthy the
invaluable title of Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Then, paſs no longer, ſo unconcernedly and
without notice, the diſtreſſed and wretched
ſituation of the moſt helpleſs part of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
who are not impowered by any means
whatever to defend themſelves; having, by
the ſtrong power of cuſtom, ſo long been
deemed unworthy of notice.</p>
            <p>O! may that auſpicious day arrive. when
the curtain may be withdrawn, and the tragic
ſcene expoſed to open view; when every
true Briton who reveres his Maker, or his
king, may cheerfully exert himſelf in the
general cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0803200700:25"/>
What greater ſatisfaction can the good
heart feel, than to be the inſtrument of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſtreſs from the dark ſhades of obſcurity
and wretchedneſs? In addition to which, are
we not fully convinced, from the words of
our bleſſed Teacher, that a kind and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
diſpoſition towards our fellow-creatures,
is one of the greateſt precepts of our religion?
Does he not ſay, by this the world ſhall know
you to be my diſciples, if you love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
Then, on the ſtrength of divine exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
let us comfort theſe poor women in
the words of the immortal Milton:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"Be not diſheartened then, nor cloud thoſe looks,</l>
               <l>"That wont to be more cheerful and ſerene."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But with joyful expectation wait a relief to
thoſe trying hardſhips which the unfortunate
part of poor females have ſo long ſuſtained; not
doubting but ſome friendly and humane well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſher
to the diſtreſſed, <hi>and the public in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
will zealouſly undertake the cauſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
individually, or in general, matters not;
for it is not to be ſuppoſed, all men are in the
ſame mind at once, or can obtain a ſull know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0803200700:26"/>
of the caſe at firſt view; but when once
begun, doubtleſs others will as quickly join
in the grand cauſe, and from a ſerious ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,
diſcover ſome mode of regulating this
complex buſineſs, which carries ſuch a vaſt
train of grievances after it, and which is deeply
interwoven with the happineſs of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of the people, connected with the
whole, will manifeſt itſelf to every ſerious
enquirer, and ſhall be more fully enlarged
upon, as we explore the dreary ſcene. But
I can never force myſelf to a belief, that
woman, the mother of all mankind, was ever
intended by Divine Providence to become a
butt, or mark, to receive ſo many piercing
darts from the ſons of her boſom, as her only
reward for all that maternal affection and
kindneſs which the helpleſs ſtate of infancy
and childhood render ſo neceſſary: inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently,
does it not ſeem a ſocial intereſt
in nature, to give aid and ſuccour to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?</p>
            <p>No: it was never intended that women
ſhould be left deſtitute in the world, without
the common neceſſaries of life, which they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0803200700:27"/>
ſo frequently experience, even without any
lawful or reputable means of acquiring
them, through the vile practice of men fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch ſituations as ſeem calculated, not
only to give bread to poor females, but
thereby to enable them to tread the paths of
virtue, and render them uſeful members, in
ſome lawful employment, as well as ornaments
to their profeſſions and ſex. This lovely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
alas! is but too often thrown aſide,
and, frequently, <hi>not</hi> from vicious inclinations,
but the abſolute neceſſity of bartering their
virtue for bread.</p>
            <p>Then, is it not highly worthy the attention
of men, men who profeſs moral virtue and the
ſtricteſt ſenſe of <hi>honour,</hi> to conſider in what
mode to redreſs theſe grievances! for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were ultimately deſigned for ſomething
better, though they have ſo long fared other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</p>
            <p>That there ſhould he a mixture of characters
in the world is, beyond a doubt, for wiſe and
good reaſons, which we poor ſhort-ſighted mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
know not, more than that it is a principle
in which all reflecting perſons have agreed,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0803200700:28"/>
that our preſent ſtate, on this ſide the grave
is certainly deſigned for improvement, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to fit us for a better. This being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
where can the well-diſpoſed find a better
opportunity, than by deſending the innocent
and unprotected, ſelecting them from the
noxious part of mankind, with whom they are,
through keen adverſity, obliged to aſſociate;
and placing them in ſuch ſituations, as will
enable them, to purſue the paths of virtue, by
means of ſome honeſt employment?</p>
            <p>But to accompliſh ſo laudable a deſign
reſts both with the humane and the opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
by whoſe inveſtigation, there is not a
doubt, but it will be found a work of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
importance, not only in the preſent ſtate
of things but in looking forward to a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
For in times like the preſent, is not the
aid and aſſiſtance of men required in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
and naval departments? And in more
peaceable times, which we have to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to, are not, or ought not, the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of the country to be the firſt object con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered?
In either of theſe caſes, it evidently
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0803200700:29"/>
appears, that men may be much better employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than in filling women's occupations. For, in
the words of St. Luke, theſe poor females
may very juſtly ſay, "to dig I cannot, to beg
I am aſhamed." From this evil precedent,
there is no other alternative for theſe poor
women, but beggary or vice !</p>
            <p>Let us then, if you pleaſe, ſelect one of
theſe diſtreſſed females, out of the prodigious
multitude, and purſue her through the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating
ſcene of beggary: I believe it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that pride is well known to be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
paſſion of the human breaſt, and
conſequently any comments on that head are
needleſs; but certain it muſt be, that after,
perhaps, a life of eaſe and affluence, to be
compelled to ſuch a mortifying ſituation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
more than a common ſhare of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to ſupport. Still this prevailing paſſion,
with all its train of attendants, muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
in the dreadful ſituation of beggary
which cannot fail to bring down the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of theſe unhappy victims, with more
oppreſſive force than it is in the power of
words to expreſs, or pen to paint, and can
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0803200700:30"/>
only be conceived, <hi>in part,</hi> by the ſilent
ſenſations of thoſe who can adopt another's
woes, and trace the paſſions of the human
mind. For what muſt not be the perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a mind like this, when dire neceſſity
compels the poor, neglected victim to purſue
ſuch degrading ſteps, in order to ſupport a
miſerable exiſtence! See her trembling
limbs, which are ſcarcely able to ſupport her
load of wretchedneſs, whilſt ſhe aſks an alms
from the caſual paſſenger. She who, perhaps,
a ſhort time ſince, charmed her acquaintance
with her ſprightly converſation and vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tuous
example, by one adverſe ſtroke, is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſo ſoon become the contempt, the ſcorn,
and the outcaſt of mortals! Nor is this
wretched doom confined to youth alone; but,
by the cruel hand of fate, the poor, dejected
mother, as well as daughter, is condemned to
ſhare the ſame direful misfortunes, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the ſame low ſtate of wretchedneſs,
from which their characters are ſtigmatized
with infamy, and to which they unavoidably
fall a ſacrifice. In this miſerable ſtate
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0803200700:31"/>
they muſt for ever remain, until the ſpirit
of oppreſſion and miſtaken prejudice is
eradicated, and the heavy cloud of miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
cleared away, through a proper
inveſtigation of the cauſe, which, doubtleſs,
will lead to a conviction; that the diſtreſs
and wretchedneſs of theſe poor, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
creatures originate chiefly from the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious
and mercenary views of that ſet of
beings, who are "Eating the bread of the
hungry, and drinking the drink of the thirſty."
Nor are theſe poor women allowed "to pick
up the crumbs," which will appear in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let us, if you pleaſe, take
another view of this poor mother and her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
daughter, in this forlorn and diſtreſſing
ſtate of beggary, and there ſee what relief they
obtain, from their piercing accents and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſighs—little more, it is to be feared, than
contempt or inſults. Even the hand of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
accuſtomed to beſtow on the needy, no
ſooner obſerves the appearance of youth, or
a capability of induſtry, than it is inſtantly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0803200700:32"/>
withdrawn, and kept in reſerve (as it is
thought) for ſome more proper object.</p>
            <p>Good heavens, what a ſcene of woe! when
the poor mother and her helpleſs daughter
are turned adriſt, to the mercy of an unfeeling
world ; which neither their genteel education,
or delicate conſtitutions, broken down by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and hardſhips, can prevent. O! what
diſtreſs, in a ſituation like this! The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the fond mother, in the full bitterneſs
of maternal affection, takes another, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
view of her darling child; perhaps the
only remaining pledge of a late kind partner!
ſees her ſtill laden with the fruits of a
pious education at leaſt; views her with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable
fondneſs, "whilſt all the ſoft paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of her tender ſoul throb through her
breaſt with unavailing grief," at the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of their deſtruction! In vain do they
ſupplicate their former friends, for the voice
of cenſure has pointed them out as infamous!
Good God ! what grief can equal this? Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
by friends, and left to the reproach,
contempt, and cenſure of a cruel world,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0803200700:33"/>
without a proviſion, or any probable means of
gaining a ſubſiſtence, or even the ſmalleſt
glimpſe of diſtant hope.</p>
            <p>And, though ſhocking to relate, yet ſuch is
the miſerable ſituation of thouſands of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenceleſs
women.</p>
            <p>Nor let the unfeeling and cenſorious part of
mankind refute the aſſertion, until proviſion
is made for the relief of all thoſe who would
be both induſtrious and virtuous, had they the
means. After which, the remaining few
may juſtly be reckoned in the claſs of incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
ſinners, and be a ſufficient mode of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a diſcrimination.</p>
            <p>But until that proviſion is made, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human,
baſe, and cruel, and beneath the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of a Chriſtian, to load with infamy the
poor, neglected female, who ſuffers through
misfortunes, and the continuation of an evil
precedent; and whoſe paſſive virtue is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
at the very inſtant of calumny, offering
up the divine petition of, "Father, forgive
them, they know not what they do;" and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to arm with Chriſtian fortitude
herſelf and beloved child, according to the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0803200700:34"/>
advice of the wiſe man, who ſays, "Haſ
thou children, inſtruct them from their youth."
She remonſtrates with the child of her boſom
not with ſtanding ſhe is her partner in wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſtill encourages her to perſevere i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
virtue, and live in joyful hope.</p>
            <p>"Let us, my dear child,"; ſays ſhe, "form

and ſtrangers here. Let us keep in view the

the hand which made us is divine. Then, let
not our feet tread in the muddy paths of vice
nor ſuffer the purity of our good intentions to
be ſtained with a ſingle act of diſobedience to
a Supreme Power."</p>
            <p>And under theſe and ſuch like reviving
comforts, the effects of a religious and pious
education, ſhe ſtill endeavours to perſevere in
virtue, though in the midſt of poverty; a ſtate
which, without the interference of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
not any thing can hide them from but
the ſilent grave. Oh! let not then our ears
be polluted by the envenomed breath of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0803200700:35"/>
but endeavour to remove the cauſe, as
well as ſtigma, which, like the pendulum to a
clock, ſets every wheel of wretchedneſs in
motion; and by ſeriouſly inveſtigating the
cauſe, ſearching deeply into the ſtate of facts,
and the origin of this tribulation, let the
cenſure reſt where it is due. For, is it not
enough, enough indeed! for the innocent to
ſtruggle with the hardſhips of penury and
want, without the double load of malevolence?
Alas! even in this deſpicable ſtate, they
are ſtill liable to ſorrows they never yet felt,
nor are even aware of; for the very means
they are driven to uſe, to obtain the triſling
pittance which they ſue for, renders them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the mercileſs hand of any avaricious
ruſſian, who may be baſe enough to drag theſe
poor victims they know not where.</p>
            <p>What ſays the Vagrant Act?—"Perſons
who beg in the ſtreets are idle and diſorderlv;
and any perſon who apprehends and carries
ſuch a beggar before a juſtice, ſhall receive five

However ſhocking the ſentence, what num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers
of theſe poor objects have been drag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged
away by the ruthleſs hand of the unfeeling

               </gap>
of one or another? Good heavens! there
ſurely needs no Siddonian powers to heighten
ſuch a tragic ſcene. She who, perhaps, was
reared with all the gentle ſoftneſs and mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
care of a fond parent; ſhe, who ſo lately
was looked upon as an ornament to her ſex,
until the preſſure of misfortunes compelled
her to ſeek for bread, to be at once confined
in a dark priſon, there to be obliged to hear
all the opprobrious language of the very low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſet of beings, and that under a ſtorm of
oaths and imprecations, which, of itſelf, muſt
pierce her very ſoul. There to have her ears
grated with the rattling of bolts and bars, and
all the adamantine ſetters of miſery. Good
God! is it poſſible we can ſee our fellow
creatures debaſed ſo low ! Can we ſee the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and delicate frame, which was formerly
accuſtomed to eaſe and tranquillity, and which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0803200700:37"/>
was formed by nature to participate in others
misfortunes! can we let theſe innocent and
helpleſs beings paſs unnoticed, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate
their diſtreſs, and aſk, from whence
the cauſe?—No! it is impoſſible the eyes can
any longer be ſhut to their ſufferings, or the
ears to their piercing cries of, "Have pity on
me! Oh! ye, my friends, have pity on me!"</p>
            <p>Is not this real diſtreſs? Surely there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be any thing more wretchedly miſerable
than the ſituation of theſe poor women, who
are prohibited from ſharing in induſtry, or the
common neceſſaries of life, or even taſting
the very dregs of comfort. For let us but
figure to ourſelves this wretched pair upon
their bed of ſtraw, with all their innocence,
with all their tenderneſs, and quick ſenſations
of diſtreſs, ſtill laden with the fruits of a pious
education,
<q>
                  <l>"They ſhriek, ſtart up, the ſame ſad proſpect find,</l>
                  <l>"And wake to all the ills they left behind."</l>
               </q>
And thus they linger out a wretched exile in
this miſerable dungeon, until the law hath
had its courſe, and they again are liberated.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0803200700:38"/>
When ſee, the fond mother, the poor mother,
taking another, and another review of her
wretched offspring, groaning out a miſerable
exiſtence on the narrow verge of life! her
ſorrow ſurrounds her like the ſtern winter's
blaſt, and ſhe feels her worn-out ſenſes juſt
bordering upon deſponding madneſs; for,
when Hope no longer offers her conſolation,
deſpondency muſt take place; and with all
the bitter pangs of diſtreſs, ſhe, like the poor
widow in ſacred writ, ſets about to prepare
her laſt handful of meal, that "they may
eat it and die." A releaſe they moſt ardently
wiſh for, whilſt in a ſtate of innocence, rather
than keep life upon ſuch wretched terms as are
now preſented: for, alas! by this time, they
ſee that period near at hand, which muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the great and ſhocking alternative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
vice or death. And what muſt be the
conflict at this long-dreaded moment, to a heart
which, in early youth, was taught to ſerve
its great Creator, and ſtill retains an ardent
wiſh to be virtuous! Can any ſtate under
heaven be more diſtreſſing to a delicate and
ſuſceptible mind, than that between good and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0803200700:39"/>
evil? And, how ſhocking it muſt be, at length,
to hear theſe poor victims of wretchedneſs,
defend themſelves, by exclaiming, "I ſought
not redreſs in vice, till urged to it by ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence,
in order to ſupport an exiſtence,
which, though I no longer covet, it is my
duty to preſerve: nor is there any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for ills like mine; for, as the wiſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
ſays, "extreme oppreſſion maketh us
deſperate!"</p>
            <p>What a horrid and ſhocking ſtate! to be
driven, by abſolute neceſſity, to ſupport a
wretched exiſtence by the forfeiture of every
thing ſhe holds moſt dear in this life, and at
the hazard of what is ſtill more precious, her
immortal ſoul !</p>
            <p>Beſides, what muſt not be the agonies of
her ſoul in this wretched ſtate, on the dreadful
approach of death? a death which, though ſo
much deſired in innocence, is dreaded with
ſo great horror in guilt, when all her crimes
appear at once to her diſtracted view. Worn
out with intemperance and diſeaſe, ſhe feels
the dreadful period near at hand, when ſhe
muſt appear before the grand tribunal!
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0803200700:40"/>
How many are her penetential tears in ſuch a
horrid ſituation? She calls, and calls again,
upon her great Creator, "O Lord, rebuke
me not in thy fury, nor chaſtiſe me in thy
wrath ; for who can ſtand before the face of
thy indignation?" And thus ſurrounded
with all theſe diſmal and heart-piercing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
without a friend to comfort, or the
ſtill more invaluable conſolations of a dying
Chriſtian ; her every ſenſe is racked with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and little unlike the infernal regions is
her wretched ſituation.</p>
            <p>Whilſt her aſſociates in vice are revelling
in drunkenneſs, in order to baniſh from their
reflections all ideas of the horrid ſcene, and
thus ſhe lies, "Groaning out the poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of life," her limbs bathed in ſweat, and
ſtruggling with convulſive throws, pains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
throbbing in every pulſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
darts of agony transfixing her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"In that dread moment, how the frantic ſoul</l>
               <l>"Raves round the walls of her clay tenement,</l>
               <l>"Runs to each avenue and ſhrieks for help,</l>
               <l>"But ſhrieks in vain. How wiſhfully, ſhe looks</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0803200700:41"/>
"On all ſhe's leaving, now no longer her's.</l>
               <l>"A little longer, yet a little longer."</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus her exhauſted breath expires, and
ſhe dies in all the bitterneſs of woe. And this
alike muſt continue to be the fate (as it has
been ſo long to numbers) of both parents and
children, unleſs the kind hand of interference
ſhall ſever the chain of miſery, by which they
have ſo long been held down.</p>
            <p>But will not a ſerious inveſtigation into
theſe ſcenes of horror be ſufficient to arouſe
the moſt callous of mankind? for who would
not uſe their utmoſt endeavours to relieve ſuch
unheard-of diſtreſs? Or, what is ſtill better,
prevent ſuch dire calamities, and all ſuch
complicated ſcenes of miſery and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
for, is it not always granted, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
is better than cure?</p>
            <p>Then let it not be ſaid, that a country ſo

the utter deſtruction of families of all deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
in which caſe, is it poſſible unwary
youth ſhould eſcape ?</p>
            <p>What numbers of unguarded young men,
even with hearts inclined to virtue, have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
been drawn on to vice, by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
inſinuations of theſe poor abandoned fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0803200700:43"/>
who, like Eve in Paradiſe, is no ſooner
fallen herſelf, than, by deceitful artifice, ſhe
ſpreads the net of deſtruction to catch others.
For example: need we go any farther than
the theatres, the reſort of all, both good and
bad, and where abandoned females, of all ages
and degrees of profligacy, attend to make their
harveſt, and gather in their unlawful plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to ſupply the ordinary wants of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
day ? And what can better anſwer the
purpoſe of decoy than the drama? for, ſhould
it be comedy, the obſcenity which prevails in
many of our modern plays, cannot fail to act
as poiſon upon the young mind : or is it tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
what can have a greater influence upon
the feelings of ſenſibility, or ſooner awaken
the tender paſſions, which theſe miſerable
women take ſpecial care to tranſlate to their
own evil purpoſes ? Perhaps, in drawing a
ſimile of their own diſtreſs, or by ſome other
artful repreſentation or pretence, by which
ſuch numbers of innocent and inexperienced
young men are artfully led aſtray, in their
moſt unguarded moments, whilſt ſeeking a
rational and innocent amuſement, as a relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0803200700:44"/>
from the toils of the day, from which
too many have found themſelves, at once, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged
in deſtruction, and ingulphed in the
quickſands of vice.</p>
            <p>Horrid deſtruction! if all, or the greateſt
part, of this originates from women being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from ſupporting themſelves by means
of ſome lawful employment, who will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to countenance a precedent, big with ſo
much deſtruction?</p>
            <p>How many unhappy young men have fallen
a ſacrifice, both in mind and body, to the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
artifices which theſe poor, miſerable,
abandoned women are driven to practice for
bread! And how many Barnwells, who, not
able to ſupport, by honeſt induſtry, the wants
of a favourite miſtreſs, have forcibly purſued
ſuch methods as have brought them to miſery,
ſhame, and death, and their diſtracted parents
with ſorrow to their graves! leaving behind
them the remainder of an unprovided family,
to toil up the ſteep of difficulty; and, <hi>if fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males,</hi>
with all the tribulations before them
which we have been juſt tracing in others!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0803200700:45"/>
Nor does the dreadful calamity end here;
for, notwithſtanding ſo many unfortunate fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
have been obliged to ſeek bread in the
paths of vice, and ſo many young men have
fallen victims to their ſolly and wickedneſs,
ſtill the ſame devouring jaws of deſtruction
are open for its future prey; nor can they ever
poſſibly cloſe, until the grievous precedent of
men uſurping females' occupations is entirely
done away, <hi>or ſome proper ſubſtitute provided,</hi>
ſo as to enable women to ſhare the common
neceſſaries along with their fellow-creatures:
till then, we need not wonder at the vaſt
number of pickpockets and houſebreakers
which, at all times, infeſt the ſtreets, to the
diſturbance of all civil ſociety; for we may
again repeat with Milton, when night
<q>
                  <l>"Darkens the ſtreets, then wander forth the ſons</l>
                  <l>"Oh Belial, fluſh'd with inſolence and wine."</l>
               </q>
For when "young men, void of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,"
are ſeduced by ſuch lawleſs and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
methods to ſquander away, in riot and
drunkenneſs, what they have obtained by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
plander, it is no difficult talk to find
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0803200700:46"/>
out the cauſe of theſe nocturnal depredations;
for we may naturally ſuppoſe, theſe poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
women are always ready to benumb
and drown their reflections with intoxicating
liquors, the effects of which muſt lead them,
with their wretched aſſociates, into every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of ſin and wickedneſs, to the utter demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
of public happineſs and ſafety, as well
as incurring a heavy burden of expences upon
the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, the city of London alone pays
upwards of twenty thouſand pounds annually
to patrols, beadles, and watchmen; and it
may be a much greater ſum; yet, that of itſelf
ſeems a vaſt ſum indeed, to be raiſed by levy,
in which the honeſt trader muſt unavoidably
contribute a large ſhare. Would not that
contribution anſwer a much better purpoſe in
providing for the neceſſitous poor, ſuch as we
have juſt been treating of, and who are judged
unfit objects to be received into a pariſh work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe;
being, <hi>as it is termed,</hi> able enough to
earn their own bread out of the houſe?</p>
            <p>Yet, ſo long as there continues a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt women having an employment, it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0803200700:47"/>
is to be feared, double the ſum already raiſed
by the inhabitants will be found inefficacious.
But ſuch is the link of progreſſion, ariſing
from this dreadful uſurpation; which ſhews
the neceſſity of entering into the origin of
theſe melancholy truths, that ſo the chain of
connection may be found whole; otherways,
far be it from me to entertain a wiſh to offer
to the generous part of my readers a work
fraught with ſo many tragic repreſentations:
but, leaſt the want of a full narrative ſhould
leave the ſubject dark to comprehend, I ſtill
purſue my plan; and even ſhould my zeal in
the cauſe of happineſs lead into an eccentric
mode of writing, be it remembered it is an
eccentric cauſe, but with a moſt ſanguine wiſh
to ſee all the inhabitants of this favoured iſle
become uſeful and happy members of ſociety,
inſtead of being the harpies of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>That political and private happineſs are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably
connected, is beyond a doubt; and
that the morals of this nation are very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
is but too viſible, from the vaſt numbers
of diſgraceful women who infeſt the face of
the country. As for the number of theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0803200700:48"/>
ſerable beings, it cannot be an eaſy matter to
aſcertain : but ſuppoſe, from the prodigious
numbers, that are ſeen ſcattered about, like
ſheep having no ſhepherd, that in London, for
example, there are five or ſix thouſand: Nay;
I have either read, or heard it ſaid, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand!
but how that calculation can be made,
I ſhall not take upon me to ſay ; yet, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
we call it half that number; are not five
thouſand deſtitute females too many to ſuffer
through ſo poor a cauſe, and will not a much
leſs number ſuffice to contaminate the morals
of more than half the youths in town, and
prove a ſource of deſtructive oppreſſion to a
vaſt number of inhabitants? for, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
how can we expect happineſs, or what is
to ſupport the public good?</p>
            <p>Then, what ſort of beings are they, who
can, with impunity, oppreſs theſe unfortunate
women, to the entire deſtruction of all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
both national and domeſtic? Or where
is the breaſt, truly warm in the cauſe of virtue
and a country's good, who will ſuffer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of a precedent ſo deſtructively op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive,
without exerting themſelves in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0803200700:49"/>
cauſe? for granting it is a great part of the
Chriſtian religion, to aſſilt our neighbours
as far as we are empowered. To neglect an
inveſtigation of theſe grievances admits no
excuſe, when once the clouds of obſcurity
are diſperſed; for enquiry is the great ſource
of knowledge.</p>
            <p>From the holy ſcriptures we learn, that
"Wiſdom is juſtified in all her children;"
and from what but wiſdom and juſtice is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
the ſupport of our common weal, by
inveſtigating which, will not the judicious
quickly diſcover a numerous train of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
grievances not yet told. Let him but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the cauſe of ſuch vaſt numbers of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victs
having been ſent abroad, to the great
expence of the nation; and ſee if their
connection with theſe neceſſitous women
has not been a great means of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes:
for, alas! young men, upon their
firſt entrance into the world, are too often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebriated
with the pleaſing, but baneful, draught
of pleaſures, till their ſenſes are ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated,
that they run they know not where,
and at length find themſelves enſnared in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0803200700:50"/>
the net, which theſe poor abandoned women,
or rather the inſtigators of their miſery, have
ſo artfully ſet to entrap the unwary.</p>
            <p>Yet, a ſerious conſideration, no doubt, will
prompt an enquiry, and a perſeverance in the
purſuit; and ſurely we may hope, an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
founded on ſuch a baſis as the laws of
humanity, and a general good, can never fail
of ſucceſs. Nor will the more generous part
of men-traders, ſuch as are before deſcribed,
delay to reſign a privilege, maintained upon
ſuch unjuſt principles; for far, very far, be it
from me to ſuppoſe, or entertain a with to
inſinuate a ſuppoſition, that all effeminate
tradeſmen are equally guilty of a known vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
Nor is any individual accuſed for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
crimes: yet, does it not behove
every member of ſociety to inform themſelves,
eſpecially when the object of enquiry is of
ſuch great magnitude, as to extend beyond
the intereſt of individuals, and affect a whole
community?</p>
            <p>It is beyond a doubt, that many men,
through the force of cuſtom, are ignorant of
the injury they are doing their neighbour,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0803200700:51"/>
and mankind in general, the details of which
I have very ſcrupulouſly collected, and may
ſay with Shakeſpeare, I have "nothing exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated,
nor ſet down aught in malice."</p>
            <p>Indeed, I have not a wiſh to accuſe, or call in
queſtion, the conduct or motive of any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual.
No: ſuffice it that Pappeal to their own
feelings, to humanity, and the goſpel truths;
after which, let the inward monitor of the
guilty ſay,
<q>Thou art the man.</q>
But permit me to infer, this ſelf accuſation
only extends to one part of the oppreſſive
body; yet, what is to be ſaid for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
who ſhall ſtill perſevere in perfecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe poor helpleſs women, to the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

by the inſpired writer, "It is not the will of
our Father, which is in heaven, that one of
theſe little ones ſhould periſh." Then, in

            <p>That great numbers would be happy in
contributing to the aid and relief of thoſe who
appear to be objects of diſtreſs, is beyond a
doubt: but, alas! for helpleſs, injured females!
the heavy clouds of prejudice and miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
have thrown ſo dark a veil between
them and the pity of the world, that they are
deſpiſed by all. Yet, when the curtain is once
withdrawn, and the tragic ſcene expoſed to
open view, leading theſe poor creatures from
obſcurity into open light, then will be the
criſis, when every good Chriſtian may be
impowered to ſoften the affliction of another's
woes; and though it may not be in the power
of every ſympathiſing breaſt to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

not every one allow, ſo ſmall a recompence, in

thoſe days, it was found a ſufficient proviſion,

the reaſon is evident; every article of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
at that time bore a very inferior price to
what it does now. Wheat, for example,

I acknowledge, we are too apt to call things
juſt, that have been long in practice; and,
through ancient cuſtom, theſe oppreſſive
tradeſmen act in open defiance of either equity
or conſcience, thinking none will call them
to account, and they may ſtill ride triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
upon the ſtream of avarice. But let not
a precedent, abounding with ſo much miſchief,
any longer diſgrace the age; let not virtue
and happineſs any longer be bartered, which,
in the preſent caſe, they evidently are, to the
abuſe of all civil ſociety, and diſuniting the
very bands of mutual benefit and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
nor ſuffer theſe men to monopolize
the whole from the female part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            <p>Nothing, it is preſumed, can be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable

others of ſubſiſtence ſhould contribute to their
ſupport. For what law, either divine or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
will juſtify the continuance of a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
which has influence ſufficient to prevail
over the virtue of individuals? What ſtatute is
there, which grants that men alone ſhall live,

Britons can cheriſh a wiſh to oppreſs their ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

are merciful to the fatherleſs and the widow;

admit a woman of loſt reputation into their

            <p>Under ſuch a preſſure of misfortunes,

            <p>When ſuch an alternative is preſented, what

the avenue which leads to ſo much miſery.
Doubtleſs, through the viciſſitudes of human
affairs, neither great riches nor great happineſs
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0803200700:78"/>
are always permanent; the dark and crooked
paths of fate are, by the unerring hand of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, hid from mortal eyes: nor
can we ſee into futurity. "To-day we are here,
and to-morrow in the grave;" or, according
to the Proverbs, chap. xxvii. v. 1. "Who
knoweth what a day may bring forth?" For
how often does death, inſatiable death, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
ſnatch, in a moment, the indulgent
parent from the beloved child, who is at once
left at large in the wide world, perhaps in the
morning of her days, and in all the ſimplicity
of artleſs youth, without a proviſion, or any
means of obtaining one. Pitiable object!
thy fate ſeems hard indeed: yet ſo it but too
frequently happens to hundreds, beſides thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Where wilt thou go, to ſecure thee
from real want? A pariſh workhouſe is but a
poor conſolation for ſo great a loſs, at a period
when neither reaſon nor religion is ripened
into maturity, to moderate the grievance. But,
if, perhaps, a friend ſtep forward, the Aſylum
for the protection of Orphan Girls may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the poor fugitive; in which bleſſed and
happy inſtitution, through time, the memory
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0803200700:79"/>
of her woeful loſs, in parents and proviſion,
may, in ſome degree, be wiped away in the
benevolence of her new protectors, who not
only provide for her temporal, but alſo for her
ſpiritual concerns, in inſtructing her as a good
Chriſtian and a uſeful member. But, alas!
ſmall is the number which this inſtitution
can admit, when compared with the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
left in ſimilar ſituations. And for thoſe,
who are more advanced in age, to what ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
can they repair? It is true, neceſſity will
teach people to exert themſelves, who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their own induſtry to depend upon,
and conſequently they ſeek for a female occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.
But how great their ſurpriſe, and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible
their grief, to find, like the reſt, that
they are repulſed in every purſuit of induſtry,
whereby they might expect a maintenance!</p>
            <p>Good Heavens! what courſe can a poor,
young creature purſue, when, from the quick
tranſition from good to evil, at that early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of life, when diſcernment has not made its
way to a knowledge of the world, ſhe is at
once on the verge of the precipice, where ſo
many have unhappily been loſt? Without a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0803200700:80"/>
pilot, ſhe finds herſelf launched out into the
ocean of the world, where ſhe floats about ſo
awhile, until ſhe perceives her danger, and
would gladly retreat; but neither meeting pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tection
nor aid, neceſſity drives her back, and ſhe
ſhortly engages in the diſſipation of the
age, and at once becomes the object of ſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and contempt, and the real food for ſcandal

her reputation, and ſhe is now doubly diſtan
from a friend to defend her, or point out
mode of redreſs; for the unfeeling part of the
world exclaims, in the words of a much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired

withſtanding "God hath given to every one
the charge of his neighbour."</p>
            <p>This excellent charge being ſo very ſeldom
put in practice, ſuperadded to her youth and
inexperience, ſhe not being ſufficiently armed
with that fortitude, which is ſo neceſſary in
her time of trial, and ſeeing the frowns of the

and even launches out ſtill farther in the
ſtream of thoſe falſe and miſtaken pleaſures,
which cannot fail to terminate in her deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, perhaps, at length, ſhe triumphs
in obtaining (what ſhe thinks) protection from
thoſe whoſe acknowledged right it is to guard
the weaker ſex.</p>
            <p>But here, alas! under the ſpecious name of
friendſhip, ſhe too ſoon ſees her miſtake, and
finds herſelf the real object of diſtreſs, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
by the world, and left to her own bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reflections; until the kind hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
once more takes her under protection,
and admits her a member of that humane
charity, the Magdalen; where, in a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
ſhe is once more permitted to taſte a
portion of comfort, by the cheering rays of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0803200700:82"/>
Chriſtian charity; and her oppreſſed ſpirits
are ſomewhat enlivened by the following ſweet
and comfortable diſcourſe from the Matron,
on her admiſſion into that moſt excellent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>"You cannot be inſenſible of the kindneſs

            <p>How can charity be better employed than
in taking care of the ſoul as well as the body?
This is, perhaps, the moſt comfortable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
ſhe has heard ſince death cloſed the lips
of her dear parents. Yet how much greater
would be the charity for protecting the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,

            <p>How nearly do the humane contributors to
this excellent charity imitate the compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
ſentence of our bleſſed Lord, when he
bade the offending woman "Go, and ſin no
more?" For there is ſcarcely a period in
life, when the moſt irregular characters may
not be reclaimed. It is through misfortunes
and a want of employment, that ſuch as
theſe poor, helpleſs, young creatures have
brought ſo great an additional load of heavy
misfortunes upon their guilty heads; yet, we
are told, there is joy in heaven at the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of a ſinner:—What a bleſſed inſtitution,
then, to provide a means for that purpoſe!</p>
            <p>Human nature is undoubtedly liable to
corruption, yet it is impregnated with the
ſeeds of virtue; and when the mind is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cultivated, they will quickly grow up and
ripen into good works. It muſt afford a moſt
lively and pleaſing ſenſation to the humane
and ſympathiſing breaſt, in contributing their
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0803200700:85"/>
endeavours, to let the memory of former
woes be loſt in the enjoyment of preſent bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
            <p>Compaſſion is a heaven-born virtue, and
not only conſoles the innocent, but is the firſt
ſtep to reclaim the guilty: a kind and gentle
treatment muſt ever be efficacious, when harſh
proceedings, in general, drive to deſperation.
For the truth of this, we need but ſcrutinize
our own hearts, (the golden rule is a moſt
excellent guide) and there ſee, on a ſerious
inveſtigation, if any one of us is not more
ready to comply, in any caſe whatever, by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
means, than from the force of peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
methods.</p>
            <p>Yes: the moſt obdurate ſinner, if poſſeſſed
of one ſingle ſpark of grace, on the repeated
calm admonitions of a good Chriſtian, cannot
ſuppreſs that ſpark from kindling into a flame
of gratitude, at leaſt, and muſt bluſh at their
perfidy; whereas the hardened wretch, by
conſtant upbraidings and ſevere treatment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
callous to every thing.</p>
            <p>Therefore, theſe poor young women, who
have, through extreme neceſſity, been driven
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0803200700:86"/>
to criminal and unlawful purſuits, are not to
be deſpiſed or ſunk beneath our care, but
cheriſhed and ſupported, in order to reclaim
their wicked courſe of life. What ſays the
oracle of truth?—Whilſt we have time, let
us do good, for the night cometh, when no
man can work.</p>
            <p>For the opulent, and thoſe in power, to
ſuppoſe they have done their part, in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to relieve their ſpiritual wants only, is a
miſtake; ſo long as the ſoul and body act
in uniſon, proviſion muſt be made for their
temporal neceſſities alſo. What ſays St.
James, chap. ii. v. 15 and 16. "If a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or ſiſter be naked, and deſtitute of daily
food, and one of you ſay unto them, depart
in peace, be you warmed and filled, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
you give them not thoſe things which
are needful to the body, what doth it profit?"</p>
            <p>But in the humane charity of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,
as well as in others, the wants of the
needful are plentifully ſupplied, both as to
ſoul and body, and as many deſtitute objects
received as the foundation of the inſtitution
will admit; and, in general, ſuch as theſe it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0803200700:87"/>
is of whom we have been diſcourſing (if in
London) who reap the benefit. Their ages
of admiſſion being from ſixteen to twenty-ſix
years, between which periods they, in general,
find their fatal miſtake, and are happy to find
an aſylum under ſo beneficent an inſtitution.
Or if, unhappily, their ſituations in life are
too far diſtant, or other caſual accidents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them from obtaining the benefit, they
muſt inevitably fall a victim to their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
and vice, and the world's contempt.

But to conduct my readers to the various ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
which lead to the deſtruction and miſery
of the female part of the creation, would
ſwell this volume to a greater bulk than is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
therefore ſhall content myſelf with
juſt touching upon a few characters, who have
been plunged into this dreadful pit of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by the known miſconduct of connections,
or the miſhap of human events. From ſuch
as theſe it is we muſt gather our information.
Doubtleſs, imagination might lead to a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0803200700:89"/>
of viſionary flights, but, by engaging with
perſonalities, the faculties are confined, and
external appearances muſt diſtinguiſh the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>Let us then commence with a gentleman of
ſmall, independent fortune; for, as it is the
general maxim through life, that every one
ſhould endeavour to outvie his neighbour, the
gentleman alſo muſt keep up appearances for
the benefit of his family (as he is pleaſed to
term it;) and, in the preſent day, where do
we ſee the father or mother of a family, with
an independent fortune, be it ever ſo ſmall,
who would not be ſhocked at the bare idea of
placing their daughter in the world in ſuch
ſituations as would enable them to riſe, through
their own induſtry and merit, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it them for
becoming wives to ſome honeſt and induſtrious
tradeſman?—No: that would be a degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which muſt not take place. It is the eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette
of the times for the daughters to be bred
fine ladies, although it be without a fortune,
either dependent or independent, to ſupport it.
As for trade, that is out of the queſtion. The
ſons indeed are differently provided: the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0803200700:90"/>
in courſe, inherits the paternal eſtate
and the younger ones are placed in the church
the army, the navy, or at the bar; and others
again are genteelly ſituated in the mercantile
world: the whole of which are fit profeſſions
for a gentleman, and by which, if they have
merit and ſucceſs, they may acquire a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency.</p>
            <p>But for the female part of the family, what
appears in their favour? what proſpects have
they in life?—The parents die, and leave
them, without a proviſion, a burden upon
their connections; which forms the firſt ſtep
to deprive them of friends as well as ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
A miſerable inheritance, to be their
beſt and only portion! What can be ſaid in
behalf of ſuch parents? can their eaſy compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the faſhion of the times form any
apology for ſuch a miſtaken conduct?—This
ſurely cannot be called true paternal affection,
to entail upon theſe helpleſs young crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſuch a ſucceſſion of miſery as muſt even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
enſue. Is not this a ſufficient definition
of the ſecond divine commandment, that
"the ſins of the father ſhall deſcend to their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0803200700:91"/>
children, to the third and fourth generation."
Which under ſuch circumſtances is juſtly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified;
for, what leſs than a miracle can
deſtroy the entail of miſery brought upon
helpleſs innocence, by the ſins of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents?
which, however harſh the term, is
worſe than Herod's cruelty; that could only
affect the body, but by a compliance with this
miſtaken folly of the day, there is a great
chance of its affecting the ſoul alſo.</p>
            <p>What was it brought ruin upon the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed
female, who was admitted into the
Magdalen Charity; and what but a miracle
led her to taſte comfort<note n="*" place="bottom">See a book, entitled The Magdalen, or a Hiſtory of the Firſt Penitents received into that charitable Aſylum.</note>?</p>
            <p>What numbers of helpleſs and deſtitute
young women there are, who, ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
neglected and deſpiſed by their connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
notwithſtanding all the refined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
ideas which their education and mode of
bringing up have poſſeſſed them with, would
gladly endeavour, through neceſſity, to make
up the deficiency of their parents' neglect, by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0803200700:92"/>
putting themſelves forward in the world, in
order to obtain a ſupport. But, alas! to their
ſorrow, they quickly ſee it is not in their
power; for, under their preſent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
"the world is not their friend, nor the
world's laws;" and what was not effected by
their parents, cannot poſſibly be obtained by
an inexperienced young woman.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it is frequently ſaid, the female part
of the creation are by far the moſt ready in
cenſuring their own ſex. But permit me to
aſk, would it not be highly reprehenſible in
any lady to countenance even the appearance
of a guilty conduct? By ſo doing, it is not
only the means of encouraging vice, but muſt
unavoidably incur cenſure upon herſelf,
which, above all other misfortunes in life, is
the moſt to be dreaded, ſince a female charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
once loſt, is for ever irretrievable. But, in
juſtice to my own ſex, I would gladly hope,
there is not a female, who really conſiders the
many horrid miſchiefs which are the attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
upon cenſure, who will ever ſuffer the
ſmalleſt intimation thereof to eſcape the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0803200700:93"/>
bounds of her own breaſt, unleſs through the
moſt flagrant proofs of guilt.</p>
            <p>Out of the many, ſome there are, no doubt'
who, to colour their own vicious lives, are
ever ready to murder the character of any one,
without taking the ſmalleſt thought or concern
as to the conſequences, nor even ſparing the
innocent with any greater degree of lenity than
they would the guilty. But of this claſs we
hope there are but few; for, why ſhould it
be ſuppoſed that female objects in diſtreſs,
particularly thoſe who have youth and beauty
on their ſide, muſt unavoidably be objects of
contempt rather than pity? From what motive
can this certain part of the ſex continue to
load the ſufferings of theſe poor, helpleſs wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with reviling and contempt? None other,
muſt repeat it, but to draw a veil over their
own vicious lives; for neither religion nor vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue
ever countenanced ſo much injuſtice. To
cad the poor ſufferer with calumny, is cruel
indeed; ſuffice it, ſhe has to ſtruggle with
the hardſhips of penury!</p>
            <p>Let them be traced along from the moment
that fate's afflicting hand is ſtretched out againſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0803200700:94"/>
them: trace them through every ſtage of life
and then ſee if they are not the moſt pitiab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of all mortals! Then, how can the time of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
in ſearching into the ſource of their ſorrow
and endeavouring to obtain redreſs? To in

               </gap>
at hand. But for a continuation of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
diſtreſſes which poor females are ſubject
to, we need but take a general review, an
repreſent the caſe as it evidently is, which
will ſave the unpleaſant taſk of uſing names:
for, it is to be feared, few there are who have
any knowledge of life, but can reaſon upon
this ſubject, if not through fatal ſelf-expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
yet through experimental obſervations
on others. For example: how often do we
ſee whole families entirely ruined by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
conduct of a huſband or father, who,
through giving way to ſome predominant vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>,
at once overwhelms the whole of his family <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
ruin and diſtreſs, or, at leaſt, the female <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
of it, who, not being able to defend themſelves,
or ſeek redreſs, are liable to every misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0803200700:95"/>
How far the wife was intended to be the
ſlave to her huſband, I know not, but certain
we are, ſhe was deſigned to be his friend, his
companion, and united part; or, according
to the gentlemen's phraſe, his <hi>better part;</hi>
and yet how often do we ſee her ſinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the burden of a houſehold load, whilſt the
unfeeling huſband is laviſhing away the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which ought to be for the comfort and
ſupport of a family? Yet ſuch unnatural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
there are, who, by giving way to ſome
unlawful paſſion, can, without ſcruple or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe,
trample under foot all laws, divine
and human, and with impunity bring wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
upon thoſe he is bound to ſupport:
notwithſtanding St. Paul tells us, "if any one
provide not for his own, and eſpecially thoſe
of his own houſe, he hath denied the faith,
and is worſe than an infidel."</p>
            <p>Let us but look at the many unhappy
females, who come to ruin through merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
marriages. How many are the inſtances
of young women, who have been brought up
in affluence, and reared with all the tender
care and attention, which are in the power
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0803200700:96"/>
of maternal affection to beſtow; yet, perhaps,
through her youthful follies and credulity, ſhe
is led away by the artifice and falſe pretenſions
of one of theſe mercenary men, on whom ſhe
cheerfully beſtows her patrimony, whether
acquired by inheritance, or the ſmiles of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
upon the honeſt induſtry of her deceaſed
parents, avails not, for her expected happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is vaniſhed in empty air, and ſhe is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expoſed to all the ills of fate.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"O thoughtleſs mortals! ever blind to fate,</l>

            </q>
            <p>As leading to a further explanation, let us
repreſent a caſe which very frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens.
A gentleman's daughter, one of theſe
well-bred young ladies, which was ſpoken of at
the beginning of this diſcourſe; or be it a
tradeſman's daughter, it matters not, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
equally trained up in the ſame liberal plan
of female education, married to a reſpectable
and worthy tradeſman, who, we will ſay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the common run of the times, has
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0803200700:97"/>
made choice of a very proper partner for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending
the domeſtic concerns of his
houſehold, and conducting a table with taſte;
which, according to the beau monde, muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
be complied with, ſince his credit
in trade ſo greatly depends upon appearances;
and however great may be his diſlike to the
practice, yet <hi>he</hi> it is that is abſolutely obliged
to comply with the cuſtom of the times, and
make a figure in life, in order to ſupport the
credit of his trade; a precedent big with every
evil conſequence, yet he muſt comply, and act
like his neighbour, if he expects to receive
neighbour's fare. Therefore, before we cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or condemn ſuch conduct in any one
individual, let us, if you pleaſe, place choice
and neceſſity in the ſcales of juſtice, and ſee
which will preponderate.</p>
            <p>I recollect an obſervation upon this ſubject
ſome time ago, made by a noble and very
learned man, the Earl of—. Says his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
"it is the tradeſman and mechanic who
are under the neceſſity of making a figure in
life, in order to catch notice and obtain credit
in their line of buſineſs." But, continued his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0803200700:98"/>
lordſhip, "for ſuch as me there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
and conſequently we can ſave whilſt
they are obliged to ſpend: we can live as we
pleaſe, dreſs as we pleaſe, and, in fine, act as
we pleaſe; for our independence and anceſtry
will always command reſpect, and enable us
to do as we like."</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I thought it was a hard caſe,
that ſo many ſenſible, clever men, of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
claſs, with regard to pecuniary matters,
ſhould abſolutely be held down for what was
not a fault; but, after a moment's conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I could not help joining in the validity
of his lordſhip's opinion. Although I knew,
at the ſame time, his lordſhip was frequently
ridiculed for the meanneſs of his table and
dreſs; yet, it occurred to me, that <hi>did not</hi>
eraſe any names from his lordſhip's rent-roll;
though the ſame conduct might occaſion a
great deficiency in a tradeſman's ledger.</p>
            <p>In fine, need we advance any further than
Change-alley for a confirmation, that it is in
compliance with evil cuſtoms, and a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to deſtructive precedent, that bring on
ſuch a train of misfortunes, with the greateſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0803200700:99"/>
force, which is ſure to fall where there is the
leaſt reſiſtance? How frequent and ſudden
are the fluctuations in the ſtocks, owing to the
artifices of ſtock-jobbers, under ſome falſe
pretence or other: notwithſtanding it is a
practice ſo highly deteſted, both by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the generality of the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
yet appearances take the lead; ſo that,
however wrong the practice, ſince the tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
finds the abſolute neceſſity of acting like
his neighbour, no doubt but a generous public
will either point out an expedient, or abſolve
<hi>him,</hi> at leaſt, from cenſure, let the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
prove how it may. Pope ſays.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"True conſciencious honour is to feel no ſin,</l>
               <l>"He's arm'd without that's innocent within:"</l>
            </q>
            <p>and very juſtly ſo, <hi>with regard</hi> to men; but
for poor women, the weight of all theſe griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
muſt unavoidably reſt upon them, as the
weakeſt ſex; who, having ſtruggled through
the labyrinth of misfortunes, no ſooner arrive
at the gate of induſtry, viz. <hi>female occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
than they find it ſhut, and men, ſo much
ſtronger, and in power, the porters at the door.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0803200700:100"/>
So, begging pardon for the digreſſion, we will
leave theſe poor unfortunate women at the gate,
and peeping through the wicket to no effect,
till we proceed with our young couple, who
journey on a few years through this maze of
life, a life that ſeems calculated for felicity,
happy in each other, and bleſſed with a riſing
progeny, which, in courſe becomes the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
care, whilſt the father, attentive to the
intereſt of his family, endeavours to extend
his trade for the mutual advantage of all; and
thus tied with the ſilken bands of unity, they
paſs their days in one continued round of
bliſs, actuated by the amiable endearments of
the affectionate father, the fond huſband, and
the generous friend. But, alas! how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
does the malice of fate unſeen, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
and often blaſt, the happineſs of human
enjoyments.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Ah gentle pair! ye little think how nigh</l>
               <l>"Your change approaches, when all theſe delights</l>

            <p>Next, let us ſuppoſe, which ſuppoſition too
is frequently realized, that the father of this
happy family. whom we have juſt left in the
ſunſhine of proſperity, and in the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of conjugal and paternal bliſs, is ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away by the hand of death, and leaves his
diſconſolate widow, in the meridian of her
days, ſurrounded by her innocent offspring, who
muſt now look up to her alone for protection,
which even herſelf may ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>How keen, how poignant muſt be her grief
at ſuch a ſeparation, when, at once, ſhe is
robbed of a tender huſband, and her children
of an indulgent father! Yet, like a true
Chriſtian, ſhe endeavours to arm herſelf with
ſuch fortitude as is neceſſary to ſupport her in
the time of trial; and by the help of reaſon
and religion, ſhe begins to revive, and ſlatters
herſelf with new hopes, in the many comforts
ſhe is to receive from her darling children.</p>
            <p>Short-fighted mortal! ſhe now begins to
take new courage, from having ſubdued her
ſtubborn heart to ſubmit, as ſhe thinks, to her
greateſt affliction; which, alas! is no more
than a prelude to her future misfortunes: for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0803200700:102"/>
her late huſband's concerns come next to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted,
when it is found there is a very ſmall
proviſion, if any, left for herſelf and helpleſs
children: for the deceaſed huſband, having
been under the neceſſity of deceiving the
world by the vile pretext of appearances, has
now involved his family in the unavoidable
neceſſity of ſeeing the world had deceived
him; the dreadful conſequences of which they
are now left to ſtruggle with. Theſe are real
trials: yet how frequently do they happen!
and now, at once, are all her expectations of
future happineſs blaſted; an intervening cloud
has darkened the ſcene, and that maternal
triumph which uſed to gladden the face of the
fond mother, is now done away by the dark
gloom of adverſity; and her ſorrows are like
the impetuous torrent. A family, brought up
and educated with the idea of being gentlemen
and ladies, who have juſt been figuring away
in the gaieties of life, to find themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
in a wilderneſs of miſery, without
money, and conſequently without friends, or
any means of ſupport, requires more than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſtrength to combat; for, in ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0803200700:103"/>
ſituation, independent of real want,
the ſtruggles of reluctant nature are not eaſy
to ſuppreſs. The parent, the virtuous and
tender mother, ſees her darling offspring, with
all their innocence about them, upon the
verge of deſtruction, yeſterday, in the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of all the happineſs this world can
beſtow, and to-day turned ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſt into the wide
world, attended with all thoſe fine and delicate
feelings which nature, education, and a pious
example could beſtow. Yet, all cannot ſave
them from the cruel hand of fate, the die is
caſt, and they muſt now bid adieu to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of life, and plunge forward in an ocean
of miſery; for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by this time, their ſmall fund
being nearly, if not quite, exhauſted, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed
mother finds the abſolute neceſſity of
making her unhappy ſituation known to ſome
relation, or former acquaintance, which ſhe
had uſed to call friend. But, alas! ſhe has
yet to learn, the world in general takes but
little concern for the fate of individuals, and
too oft, will ſooner upbraid than relieve diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs;
and ſo precarious is the poſſeſſion of
friendſhip, that, <hi>in general,</hi> on the approach of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0803200700:104"/>
diſtreſs, it diſſolves like ſnow under the rays of
the ſun, or evaporates, like ether, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of poverty: yet, ſuch an unfeeling claſs
there are, who, in proſperity, uſed to extol her
conduct; and are, perhaps, at the very moment
decking out themſelves, table, and family after
her example, and yet can be the firſt to brand
her name with obloquy.</p>
            <p>O, cruel cenſure, are not the pangs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
and poverty enough to bear! is this
Chriſtian charity! is this acting the part of the
good Samaritan! Yet, yet, it is paſt diſpute,
that ſuch diſtreſs does afflicted poverty expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
although the cordial of friendſhip, and
the benevolent ſympathy of fellow mortals
would ſo very much alleviate: however, by
woeful experience, beginning to ſee the world
in its true colours, ſhe fees her only reſource
is in the conſolation of religion, and in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſubmiſſion to the Divine Will; and with
this ſhield, ſhe endeavours to guard herſelf
and innocent ſuffering offspring from the
impending, ſtorm which appears ready to
burſt upon their unfortunate heads. Still
their pious and laudable endeavours will
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0803200700:105"/>
not alone ſupply the neceſſity of extreme
want; they are mortal, and conſequently both
nature and duty preſs hard upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
mother, to look into the world for a
means of ſupport; for now every proſpect of
happineſs to her future days is blackened
by anxious care, and, perhaps, at a period
which might have been expected the happieſt
of her life: but ſince adverſity has taught
her ſubmiſſion, and ſhe finds ſhe has to climb
up the ſleep of difficulty, with her children
dragging after her like ſo many clogs at her
feet, to retard her progreſs, her firſt ſtep is to
look out for ſituations for her ſons, to whom
Providence having denied an education, ſo as
to command ſuch ſituations in life as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of men are enabled to look up to, and
without the aid of connections, or friends, to
lead them out into the world; if the poor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can obtain for them a ſituation at the
back of a counter, it is the higheſt ſtep in life
which ſhe can ſue for, <hi>or expect; and ſuch as
theſe,</hi> indeed, are an exception as to filling
women's occupations; for, if nothing elſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
what are they to do? But for the poor
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0803200700:106"/>
mother, who perhaps has not yet attained
her thirty-fifth year, and her ſtill unfortunate
daughters, what is there in their favour? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
money, friends, character, or means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
they are unavoidably doomed to wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
if any thing on earth can be wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
notwithſtanding her utmoſt exertions, as
well as her pious and exemplary conduct to
her children, who not inſenſible to her merit,
endeavour to ſoothe her ſorrows by their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
regard and fond affections.</p>
            <p>Alas! what can they do, they all ſeem to
look up to the poor mother for aid, who I as
it not in her power even to help herſelf. She
now takes a ſerious retroſpect of her paſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the mode of education in which herſelf and

does ſhe wiſh they had been reared with induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
at leaſt, inſtead of all thoſe bright accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments,
which muſt unavoidably be loſt in

of the tenth letter of the firſt Magdalen

who was admitted into that moſt excellent

            <p>"I was reduced," ſays ſhe, "to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

            <p>"To be willing and able to work, and yet

            <p>What a miſerable proſpect for helpleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence!
What a ſhocking caſe, that poor

being precluded earning an honeſt mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
by any other means of induſtry, merely
to make way for a ſet of beings who are much
better calculated for more manly employments;
and, in particular, at a time when ſo many
men are required in defence of their country.
Beſides, if there is not employment for the

whole, and ſome muſt feel the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
are not men much better calculated to

they may be prevented from becoming bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome,
or pining away for want of real ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries?
And, however ſhocking to the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſing

of theſe melancholy truths, yet the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of poor unhappy mothers and daughters,

Witneſs a paragraph I have this day, the 17th
of Auguſt 1798, copied from a well-known
daily paper, the Morning Herald, which runs
exactly as follows:</p>

                     <salute>Mr. Editor,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>My friend and ſelf, a few days ago, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dined with an officer at his barracks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home between ten and eleven: in
Panton-ſtreet we were accoſted by an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
woman, who firſt ſolicited our charity in
Engliſh; but overhearing us, in our progreſs
ſpeak French, ſhe renewed her ſuit in that
language, probably thinking we might be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
and therefore did not underſtand the
nature of her firſt application. You will own,
it is by no means aſtoniſhing, that hearing an
Engliſh mendicant, <hi>eſpecially a female,</hi> beg in
different languages ſhould excite our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
particularly as ſhe ſpoke both fluently and
elegantly, the evident reſult of a liberal educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Under this idea, we liſtened to her petition
delivered in French, which, being now ſo
common an acquiſition, made us deſirous of
knowing whether her learning was confined to
that tongue only; my friend, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to her in Italian, and we were not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſurpriſed to find her not only miſtreſs of
that language, but alſo well verſed in Latin.</p>
                  <p>

Shocked to diſcover ſuch extenſive learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in one who ſeemed to profit ſo little by its
poſſeſſion, and conceiving her an object of the
greateſt pity, probably abandoned by unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſordid relations, we delayed not inſtantly
affording her ſome temporary relief; but in
the moment of ſo doing, I was ſo unfortunate
as to be recognized by my parents, who were
returning from a friend's houſe, where they
had ſupped. In ſuch a place, at ſuch an hour,
and with a female, what could be thought?
We were immediately adjudged criminal;
and, upon our joining them, were accordingly
reproached, as if their ſuſpicions had been
true. Such is the power of prejudice, that
it was in vain we proteſted our innocence, in
vain we informed them of the nature of our
converſation with this woman; theſe availed
us nothing: we were not only cenſured for the
immorality of the affair itſelf, but alſo deſpiſed
for the meanneſs and vulgarity of our taſte.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, what tends to confirm
them in this their premature opinion, is the
circumſtance of my friend's ſtepping aſide im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
on perceiving their approach. But
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0803200700:115"/>
how eaſy is that accounted for? in ſuch a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
where all direct proof of the innocence
of the individual is, by the peculiar nature of

            <p>Suppoſing, or even admitting, this poor
unfortunate woman to be one of the wretched
tribe, of whom we have been ſpeaking. is it
not evident, her education was not calculated
either for beggary or vice? Nor can it be
ſuppoſed, from the diſtreſs which always
ſeems attendant upon this abject ſtate of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary
alone, that it can be by choice preferred
to ſome laudable and reputable employment.
No: it is not in nature.</p>
            <p>Then, in the name of reaſon, juſtice, and
truth, permit me to aſk, from whence origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
and what is it that countenances, the
cauſe of all theſe evils? Are they incurable?
Are not women, by nature, of a more gentle
and delicate compoſition than men, and leſs
able to bear the hardſhips which ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are forced upon them? Has it not, in
all ages, been the taſk, or rather the avowed
choice, of the male part of the creation, to
protect and defend the weaker ſex? and is not
the male part of the creation better able to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0803200700:117"/>
bear cold, hunger, fatigue, and hardſhips than
women are? Poor helpleſs women! who no
ſooner meet the heavy fate of indigence, than,
from their appearance, they are bound to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a load of infamous cenſure along with it.</p>
            <p>Although, at the ſame time, permit me to
infer, there is not the leaſt neceſſity for men to
undergo the ſmalleſt part of theſe handſhips,
even bad they relinquiſhed their claim to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's
occupations, ſince there is ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of branches in trade, beſide arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which are only calculated for men.
Surely, then, women ought to be permitted to
occupy the remaining few, nor any longer
ſuffered to be bound down by theſe oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
chains; for, does not generous Pity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a hearing in their behalf? Does not
common decency forbid they ſhould be inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the manner they are? Is it manly, is it
noble, is it generous, or humane? Would
not one think, from ſuch oppreſſions, that
men had determined to exert themſelves for
the miſery and torture of their fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0803200700:118"/>
I allow this kind of reaſoning, to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
parties, may ſound rather grating to the
ear: but, be it remembered, I have not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the taſk of panegyric, but plain truth,
which needs no high-ſlown language to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it: nor have I a wiſh to make an invidious

man, and much leſs to include a whole body
of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what ſucceſs in trade, if ſuch
they have, can make the ſmalleſt atonement,
on a death-bed, or come nearly adequate to
the loſs of a poor ſoul, whom they may have
been the means of caſting into the utmoſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
and diſtreſs, and forcing to ſeek an aſylum
in the jaws of perdition? Would but a mind,

            <p>But, ſays the reaſonable enquirer, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to ſuppreſſing this ancient cuſtom, which
is pointed out as productive o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſo much evil,
ſuppoſing an expedient is found out, will it
not be attended with ſuch a number of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0803200700:119"/>
as thereby to render the remedy as
bad as the diſeaſe. To which I beg leave to
reply: I do not preſume to inſtruct the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but ſimply to communicate my ideas; for,
a complicated buſineſs like this, which has
taken ſo deep root, requires a greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in human affairs to diſcuſs than the
writer is poſſeſſed of; and a general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the cauſes which facilitate or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the happineſs of the community is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoloutely
requiſite, which diſcovers the many
convincing reaſons why a buſineſs of ſo much
conſequence ſhould be properly inveſtigated;
and, upon theſe conſiderations, as all things,
whether great or ſmall, muſt have a beginning,
I have taken ſome pains to be informed as to
the nature of the ſubject. But as it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
a female can have much knowledge in
judicature, I go upon the grounds of common
ſenſe and reaſon, and not actuated by any
other motive than a wiſh to ſee happineſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
I ſhall accordingly beg leave to proceed
to the following conſiderations; for, as in the
eſtimation and choice of things, it is always
granted we are to prefer better to worſe, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0803200700:120"/>
ſuch things as are grounded in reaſon, to
others that hold no compariſon therewith:
we will, therefore, ſuppoſe the very worſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
on which the argument can be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which is, What are this body of men to
do, or how are they to be diſpoſed of, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of their preſent employment? Which
may be briefly anſwered:</p>
            <p>That although there may be ſome men, like
women, of a timorous diſpoſition, and thereby
may experience ſome inconveniencies, yet it is
not poſſible the whole body of them can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
by reaſon that, as I before obſerved, men
can turn themſelves ſo many ways in the
world, which, were a woman to attempt, ſhe
would be pointed at as ridiculous and frantic:
independent of which, after having ſtated the
heavy grievances under which, not only the female
part of the creation are oppreſſed, but the
community in general, it may juſtly be replied,
that no man, or body of men can, in reaſon,
lay claim to a privilege that is abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to all civil ſociety: after which, will
not all other reaſons appear to have little
weight? In other caſes, has it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad any weight
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0803200700:121"/>
with the police of the country? How many
repeated inſtances have we ſeen of men, and
even bodies of men, who, by certain obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
have been obliged to give up public or
private property, when a general good could
not be otherwiſe obtained?</p>
            <p>Then, why is there any diſtinction to be
made between relinquiſhing property and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,
when the public good requires it,
which in all exigencies muſt confeſſedly be
juſt? for, if change of circumſtances were to
have no weight with the legiſlature in direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
human affairs, what would the intercourſe
of mankind end in, but contention between
private intereſt and public good? But ſo long
as we are bleſſed with a happy conſtitution,
and rulers poſſeſſing humanity united with
wiſdom, what have we to fear?</p>
            <p>Were the deſire of procuring liberty or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
for this, or any other ſet of people, at
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>azard of injuring the community, or any
part of it, the requeſt would not only be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
but unjuſt: but after ſumming up,
under each reſpective head, all the evidences
I have collected, with a very gentle hint at the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0803200700:122"/>
enormous expence, as well as danger, and
other inconveniencies attending a continuance
of this precedent, and conſidering the many
great advantages which would accrue, not only
to the community, but to themſelves, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
in more manly employments, I ſhall
leave the impartial reader to draw the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and reſt the baſis of my obſervatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
with thoſe in power, for there are few, if any,
precedents of arbitrary commitments, except
the one in queſtion, which have not come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the watchful eye of the legiſlature, whoſe
vigilance and impartiality have, at all times,
been a ſtrong barrier and ſhield againſt any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringements
upon the rights and privileges of
the Britiſh nation; and, I preſume, an inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
into the grievances of theſe poor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
females will quickly be a means of
doing away the precedent of encouraging, or
countenancing, effeminate tradeſmen, which, it
is evident, are not only the origin of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of diſtreſſes to poor helpleſs females,
and preventing parents, who may be deſirous
of breaking through the faſhions of the
times, from placing their daughters to trades,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0803200700:123"/>
but is abſolutely leading to the diſſolution of
all good government.</p>
            <p>Nor is there the ſmalleſt danger, when once
the buſineſs is commenced, that the deep pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration
and humanity of the guardians of the
common weal will ever be baffled in ſo lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a purſuit. For, notwithſtanding the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety
of the enemy of mankind may invent a
number of falſe and artful reaſonings, yet
what will all that avail, when the curtain is
drawn aſide, for then the ſpirit of juſtice and
retribution is to be no longer appeaſed by
ſuch artifice; for neither law nor equity will
admit of mending their fortunes by fraud or
violence. And, although ſome of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
body may endeavour, by little artful chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry,
to gloſs over their crimes, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to palliate them with idle excuſes, yet
the only real plea theſe oppreſſive traders can
make, being that of private intereſt, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obſerved, it has at all times been judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ordered to be given up for a public good.</p>
            <p>What can poſſibly be deemed a more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
good, than to relieve the oppreſſed,
and preſerve ſo many poor miſerable ſouls
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0803200700:124"/>
from perdition. Yet it is greatly to be feared
theſe conſiderations to men, who are grown
torpid by cuſtom, or blind by ignorance, will
give but little room for reflection.</p>
            <p>Have we not every reaſon to believe, to the
diſgrace of ſuch part of the community as
call themſelves Chriſtians, that there are ſome,
though we will hope but a ſmall part, whoſe
hearts are too much contracted and bound
down by avarice, to admit of any humane ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
which, in a quarter of the globe,
where the refinements of the age are cried up
by all nations, is unaccountably ſtrange; for,
in a ſcrupulous ſearch for facts, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the writer's opinion on this ſubject, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, there is not a ſingle page in the New
Teſtament which does not explicitly, or on
the faireſt inference, condemn ſuch conduct,
either by the example or precepts of Chriſt
and his apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Then, ſince theſe men have become apoſtates
from Chriſtianity, why any longer ſuffer their
arbitrary power to be a ſubterfuge for fraud
and oppreſſion? Let the falutary laws of
Great Britain provide means for ſuppreſſing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0803200700:125"/>
a precedent, which, through time and unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
events, has become productive of ſo
much miſchief. Or let them appear and
ſhew cauſe, why they are entitled to oppreſs
theſe poor women, in order to enjoy indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and eaſe. And let their claims to the
flagrant violation of the rights of our fair
countrywomen be developed.</p>
            <p>Although, at the ſame time, permit me to
infer, I cannot flatter myſelf theſe modes of
proceeding are expected entirely to eradicate
the ſin againſt the ſeventh commandment.
But, from the prodigious numbers, which are
by compulſion driven to the paths of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
will it not be a means of ſaving thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of miſerable creatures from ſin and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and enable magiſtrates, and men in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to exerciſe juſtice and authority over the
wicked, without fear of puniſhing the innocent
with the guilty? for, believe me, it is not the
incorrigible ſinner I take upon me to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerate,
but the encouraged, or rather the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
ſinner; and ſtill more thoſe who ſuffer
in innocence, which is the hapleſs, wretched
fate of thouſands. And although I cannot recal
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0803200700:126"/>
to my memory the trifling obſervations I have
made on this occaſion, I am conſcious they are
my real ſentiments; and flatter myſelf, however
bad the compoſition, the deſign will be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the generous and humane; when there is
not a doubt, but the heavy burden, which theſe
children of miſery have ſo long ſupported,
will quickly be thrown off, and the ſtumbling
block to virtue and happineſs be rolled away.</p>
            <p>Have we not had ſufficient proofs, that the
happineſs and welfare of mortals have at all
times been thought worthy the attention of
a Briton. Witneſs the poor ſlaves; wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
exertions have not been uſed by the humane
friends of liberty in their behalf? Yet leſs,
much leſs, are their ſufferings to be lamented
than the poor females I ſpeak of, who have
been bred up and educated in the ſchool of
Chriſtianity, and foſtered by the tender hand
of Care.</p>
            <p>The ſlave is little acquainted with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
pangs a virtuous mind labours under,
when driven to the extreme neceſſity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
their virtue for bread. The ſlave can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
feel pain at the loſs of reputation, a term of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0803200700:127"/>
which they never heard, and much leſs know
the meaning. What are the untutored, wild
imaginations of a ſlave, when put in the balance
with the diſtreſſing ſenſations of a Britiſh fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
who has received a refined, if not a
claſſical, education, and is capable of the fineſt
feelings the human heart is ſuſceptible of. A
ſlave, through want of education, has little
more refinement than cattle in the field; nor
can they know the want of what they never
enjoyed, or were taught to expect; but a poor
female, who has received the beſt inſtruction,
and is endowed with a good underſtanding,
what muſt not ſhe feel in mind, independent
of her corporeal wants, after the adverſity of
fate has ſet her up as a mark, for the ridicule,
the cenſure, and contempt of the world?
Her feelings cannot be deſcribed, nor her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
ſufficiently lamented.</p>
            <p>I recollect ſome obſervations, made ſome
years ago, by a late honourable, humane,
learned, and truly worthy member of the
Houſe of Commons<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0803200700:128"/>
of the ſlave-trade, which doubly confirms my
opinion of the great neceſſity there is for an
inveſtigation into the grievances I have been
ſpeaking of, ſince it leads to a clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
that the moſt judicious and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
may ſtill remain in the dark, as to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of our Chriſtian ſlaves at home.</p>
            <p>"There is," ſaid the honourable gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
"no ſtate in human nature but had its
compenſations. What was a ſlave? a happy
ſlave was a degraded man; his happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in having no thought of the paſt, or the
future, and this deficiency of mind it was
which leſſened the dignity of man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerred
happineſs on the African."</p>
            <p>A very ſtriking and juſt obſervation, with
regard to the African, it muſt be granted; yet
I cannot but differ in opinion, when it is ſaid,
that all mankind are capable of a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For, admitting the ſame mode of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
to ſtand good, if the oppreſſions of one
part of the creation are moderated through
their ignorance, how much muſt the other be
heightened by their ſenſibility and the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of education. Nor can I ſee the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0803200700:129"/>
trait of compenſation remaining for theſe
miſerable females, ſince the very education
they have received in youth, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounds to
their misfortunes in maturity.</p>
            <p>Then, if an inveſtigation into the buſineſs of
the ſlave-trade has been ſounded on ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and generous principles, how much
greater pleaſure muſt it give the feeling heart,
to patronize the poor, unfortunate women of
our own nation, who labour under the very
worſt kind of ſlavery, and muſt continue to
languiſh under the fetters of a painful bondage,
till death, or the kindly hand of interference,
has ſevered the chain?</p>
            <p>But the juſtice of retribution taking place,
ſhall we not ſee theſe poor, helpleſs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and not be under the ſhocking and
cruel neceſſity of ſtarving in a land of plenty?
And when the face of ſorrow is enlivened with
the ſmile of happineſs and content, and the
weary tradeſman can lie down in peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear or danger of being annoyed, by the
lawleſs plunderer; when all are united in the
bands of mutual benefit and preſervation, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0803200700:130"/>
the memory of former woes is loſt in the

reaſonably expect, that leſs than half the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe

ſufficient to encourage honeſt induſtry.</p>
            <p>But to detail the extent of human woes in
ſo ſmall a compaſs is impoſſible, ſo various
and ſo fluctuating are the events of human
life, and its ills ſo numerous: ſo many ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

purchaſed, with the portion that was allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

deſign to free my mind from vulgar prejudices
and ſuperſtition, for ſo he called revealed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
As I was urged to chuſe virtue and
reject vice, from motives which had no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0803200700:133"/>
connection with immortality. I was not
led to conſider a future ſtate either with hope
or fear. My father, indeed, when I urged
him upon that ſubject, always intimated that
the doctrine of immortality, whether true or
falſe, ought not at all to influence my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
or interrupt my peace, becauſe the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which ſecured happineſs in the preſent
ſtate, would alſo ſecure it in a future ſtate: a
future ſtate, therefore, I wholly diſregarded,
and, to confeſs the truth, diſbelieved: for I
thought I could plainly diſcover, that it was
diſbelieved by my father, though he had not
thought fit explicitly to declare his ſentiments.
As I had no very turbulent paſſions, a ductile
and good diſpoſition, and the higheſt reverence
for his underſtanding, as well as the tendereſt
affection for him, he found it an eaſy talk to
make me adopt every ſentiment and opinion
which he propoſed to me, as his own, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as he took care to ſupport his principles
by the authority and arguments of the beſt
writers againſt Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>At the age of twenty, I was called upon to
make uſe of all the philoſophy I had been
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0803200700:134"/>
taught, by his death; which not only deprived
me of a parent I moſt ardently loved, but
with him of all the eaſe and affluence to
which I had been accuſtomed. His income
was only for life, and he had rather lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
than within it; conſequently, there was
nothing left for me, but the pride and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs
of genteel life, a taſte for every thing
elegant, and a delicacy and ſenſibility that has
doubled my ſufferings. In this diſtreſs, a
brother of my mother's, who was grown rich
in trade, received me into his houſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
he would take the ſame care of me as if
I had been his own. When the firſt tranſports
of my grief were abated, I found myſelf in an
eaſy ſituation, and from the natural cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my temper, I was beginning once
more to taſte of happineſs. My uncle, who
was a man of narrow underſtanding and illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
education, was a little diſguſted with me
for employing ſo much of my time in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but ſtill more ſo, when happening to
examine my books, he found, by the titles,
that ſome of them were what he called blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
and tended, as he imagined, to make me
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0803200700:135"/>
me an atheiſt. I endeavoured to explain my
principles, which I thought beneath the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of virtue to diſguiſe or diſavow; but
as I never could make him conceive any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between a deiſt and an atheiſt, my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
only ſerved to confirm him in the
opinion, that I was a wicked wretch, who, in
his own phraſe, believed neither God nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
As he was really a good man, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
zealous for the eſtabliſhed faith, though
more from habit and prejudice than reaſon,
my errors gave him great affliction. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it with the utmoſt concern; I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too, that he looked upon me with a degree
of abhorrence mixed with pity, and that I was
wholly indebted to his good nature for that
protection, which I had flattered myſelf I
ſhould owe to his love. I comforted myſelf,
however, with my own integrity, and even
felt a conſcious pride, in ſuffering this perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
from ignorance and folly, only becauſe
I was ſuperior to vulgar errors and popular
ſuperſtition. And that Chriſtianity deſerved
theſe appellations, I was not more convinced
by my father's arguments, than my uncle's
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0803200700:136"/>
conduct, who, as his zeal was not according
to knowledge, was by no means qualified to
"adorn the doctrine which he profeſſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve."</p>
               <p>I had lived a few months under the painful
ſenſibility of receiving continual benefits from
a perſon whoſe eſteem and affection I had loſt,
when my uncle one day come into my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and after preparing me for ſome unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
good fortune, told me, he had juſt had
a propoſal of marriage for me, from a man to
whom I could not poſſibly have any objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He then named a merchant with whom
I had often been in company at his table. As
the man was neither old nor ugly, had a large
fortune, and a fair character, my uncle
thought himſelf ſufficiently authoriſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
as he did, that I could not poſſibly
have any objection to him. An objection,
however, I had, which I told my uncle was
to me inſuperable; it was, that the perſon
whom he propoſed to me as the companion,
the guide, and director of my whole life, to
whom I was to vow, not only obedience, but
love, had nothing in him that could ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0803200700:137"/>
my affection: his underſtanding was low,
his ſentiments mean and indelicate, and his
manner unpolite and unpleaſing. "What
ſtuff is all this?" interrupted my uncle, "ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
indelicate, unpolite, his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forſooth, not equal to your own! Ah!
child, if you had leſs romance, conceit, and
arrogance, and more true diſcretion and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
it would do you more good than all the
fine books you have confounded your poor
head with, and, what is worſe, perhaps, ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your poor ſoul. I own it went a little
againſt my conſcience to accept my honeſt
friend's kind offer, and give him ſuch a pagan
for a wife. But I know not, whether the
believing huſband may not convert the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
wife? As to your ſlighty objections,
they are ſuch nonſenſe, that I wonder you
can ſuppoſe me fool enough to be deceived
by them. No, child, wife as you are, you
cannot impoſe upon a man who has lived as
many years in the world as I have. I ſee your
motive; you have ſome in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idel libertine rake in
your eye, with whom you would go headlong
to perdition. But I ſhall take care to have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0803200700:138"/>
your ſoul to anſwer for, as well as your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Either I ſhall diſpoſe of you to an honeſt
man that may convert you, or you ſhall diſpoſe
of yourſelf how you pleaſe for me; for I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
all farther care or trouble about you.
So I leave you to conſider, whether or no the
kindneſs I have ſhewn you, entitles me to
ſome little influence over you, and whether
you chuſe to ſeek protection where you can
find it, or accept of the happy lot Providence
has cut out for you."</p>
               <p>He left me at the cloſe of this fine harangue,
and I ſeriouſly ſet myſelf to conſider, as he
bade me, which of the two ſtates he had ſet
before me, I ought to chuſe.—To ſubmit to
a legal ſort of proſtitution, with the additional
weight of perjury on my conſcience, or to
expoſe myſelf to all the diſtreſs of friendleſs
poverty and unprotected youth. After ſome
hours of deliberation, I determined on the
latter, and that more from principle than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination;
for, though my delicacy would
have ſuffered extremely in accepting a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
at leaſt indifferent to me, yet as my
heart was perfectly diſengaged, and my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0803200700:139"/>
naturally eaſy, I thought I could have
been leſs unhappy in following my uncle's
advice than I might probably be by rejecting
it. But then I muſt have ſubmitted to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I could not think juſtifiable, in order to
avoid mere external diſtreſſes. This would
not have been philoſophical. I had always
been taught, that virtue was of itſelf ſufficient
to happineſs; and that thoſe things which are
generally eſteemed evils, could have no power
to diſturb the felicity of a mind governed by
the eternal rule of right, and truly enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the charms of moral beauty, I reſolved,
therefore, to run all riſques, rather than depart
from this glorious principle. I felt myſelf
raiſed by the trial, and exulted in the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of ſhewing my contempt of the ſmiles
or frowns of fortune, and of proving the
power of virtue to ſuſtain the ſoul under all
accidental circumſtances of diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>I communicated my reſolution to my uncle,
aſſuring him at the ſame time of my everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gratitude and reſpect, and that nothing
ſhould have induced me to offend or diſobey
him, but his requiring me to do what my reaſon
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0803200700:140"/>
and conſcience diſapproved; that ſuppoſing
the advantages of riches to be really as great as
he believed, yet ſtill thoſe of virtue were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and I could not reſlove to purchaſe the one
by a violation of the other; that a falſe vow was
certainly criminal; and that it would be doing
an act of the higheſt injuſtice, to enter into ſo
ſolemn an engagement without the power of
fulfilling it; that my affections did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on my own will; and that no man ſhould
poſſeſs my perſon, who could not obtain the
firſt place in my heart.</p>
               <p>I was ſurpriſed that my uncle's impatience
had permitted me to go on thus far; but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his face, I perceived that paſſion had kept
him ſilent. At length the gathering ſtorm
burſt over my head in a torrent of reproaches;
my reaſons were condemned as romantic ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
which I could not myſelf believe.
I was accuſed of deſigning to deceive, and to
throw myſelf away on ſome worthleſs fellow,
whoſe principles were as bad as my own. It
was in vain for me to aſſert, that I had no ſuch
deſign, nor any inclination to marry at all. My
uncle could ſooner have believed the groſſeſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0803200700:141"/>
contradiction, than that a young woman could
ſo ſtrenuouſly refuſe one man, without being
prepoſſeſſed in favour of another. As I
thought myſelf injured by his accuſations and
tyranny, I gave over the attempt to mitigate
his anger. He appealed to Heaven for the
juſtice of his reſentment, and againſt my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
and rebellion; and then giving me
a note of fifty pounds, which he ſaid would
keep me from immediate indigence, he bade
me leave his houſe, and ſee his face no more.
I bowed in ſign of obedience, and collecting
all my dignity and reſolution, I aroſe, thanked
him for his paſt benefits, and, with a low
curtſey, left the room.</p>
               <p>In leſs than an hour, I departed, with my
little wardrobe, to the houſe of a perſon who
had formerly been my father's ſervant, and
who now kept a ſhop and let lodgings. From
thence I went the next day to viſit my father's
nephew, who was in poſſeſſion of the family
eſtate, and had lately married a lady of great
fortune. He was a young gentleman of good
parts, his principles the ſame as my father's,
though his practice had not been quite
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0803200700:142"/>
agreeable to the ſtrict rules of morality. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſetting aſide a few of thoſe vices which
are looked upon as genteel accompliſhments
in young fellows of fortune, I thought him a
good ſort of man; and, as we had always liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in great kindneſs, I doubted not that I
ſhould find him my friend, and meet with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
and encouragement, at leaſt, if not
aſſiſtance, from him. I told him my ſtory,
and the reaſons that had determined me to the
refuſal that had incurred my uncle's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
but how was I diſappointed, when, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the applauſe I expected for my heroic
virtue and unmerited perſecutions, I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſmile of contempt on his face, when he
interrupted me in the following manner:</p>
               <p>"And what in the devil's name, my dear
couſin, could make a woman of your ſenſe
behave ſo like an ideot? What! forfeit all
your hopes from your uncle, refuſe an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
match, and reduce yourſelf to beggary
becauſe, truly, you were not in love? Surely
one might have expected better from you even
at fifteen. Who is it, pray, that marries the
perſon of their choice? For my own part, who
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0803200700:143"/>
have rather a better title to pleaſe myſelf,
with a good fifteen hundred a year, than you
who have not a ſhilling, I found it would not
do; and that there was ſomething more to be
ſought after in a wife, than a pretty face or a
genius. Do you think I cared three farthings
for the woman I married?—No, faith; but
her thirty thouſand pounds were worth hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
with that I can purchaſe a ſeraglio of
beauties, and indulge my taſte in every kind
of pleaſure. And, pray, what is it to me,
whether my wife has beauty, or wit, or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
when her money will ſupply me with
all that in others? You, couſin, had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of being as happy as I am. The
men, believe me, would not like you a bit
the worſe for being married; on the contrary,
you would find, that for one who took notice
of you as a ſingle woman, twenty would be
your admirers and humble ſervants, when
there was no danger of being taken in: thus
you might have gratified all your paſſions,
made an elegant figure in life, and have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out ſome gentle ſwain, as romantic and
poetical as you pleaſed, for your ceciſbeo.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0803200700:144"/>
The good John Trot huſband would have
been eaſily managed."</p>
               <p>My indignation could be contained no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and I was leaving the room in diſdain,
when he caught me by the hand. "Nay,
prithee, my dear couſin, none of theſe violent
airs: I thought you and I had known one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
better. Let the poor ſouls who are taught
by the prieſts and their nurſes to be afraid of
hell-fire, and to think they ſhall go to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
for following nature, and making life agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
be as outrageouſly virtuous as they
pleaſe, you have too much ſenſe to be fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
at bugbears. You know that the term
of our exiſtence is but ſhort, and it is highly
reaſonable to make it as pleaſant as poſſible."</p>
               <p>I was too angry to attempt confuſing his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments;
but, burſting from his hold, told
him, I would take care not to give him a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

my ſpirits ſunk into a dejection which took
from me, for many days, all inclination to

ſtir out of my lodging, or to ſee a human
face. At length I reſolved to try whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence
and friendſhip were really incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and whether I ſhould meet with the ſame
treatment from a female friend, whoſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been the principal pleaſure of my
youth. Surely, thought I, the gentle Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
whoſe heart ſeems capable of every tender
and generous ſentiment, will do juſtice to the
innocence and integrity of her unfortunate

Amanda was a ſingle woman, of a
moderate independent fortune, which I heard
ſhe was going to beſtow on a young officer,
who had little or nothing beſides his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
I had no doubt of her approbation of
my refuſing a mercenary match, ſince ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
had choſen from motives ſo oppoſite to
thoſe which are called prudent. She had been
in the country ſome months, ſo that my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
had not reached her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0803200700:146"/>
She heard me with great attention, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
with politeneſs enough, but with a
coldneſs that chilled my very heart.</p>
               <p>"You are ſenſible, my dear Fidelia," ſaid
ſhe, "that I never pretended to ſet my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in competition with yours. I know
my own inferiority, and though many of your
notions and opinions appeared to me very
ſtrange and particular, I never attempted to
diſpute them with you. To be ſure, you
know beſt: but it ſeems to me a very odd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
for one in your ſituation to give offence
to ſo good an uncle; firſt, by maintaining
doctrines which may be very true for ought I
know, but which are very contrary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
opinions we are brought up in, and
therefore are apt to ſhock a common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
and ſecondly, to renounce his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and throw yourſelf into the wide
world, rather than marry the man he choſe
for you; to whom, after all, I do not find you
had any real objection, nor any antipathy for
his perſon."</p>
               <p>"Antipathy, my dear," ſaid I, "are there
not many degrees between loving and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0803200700:147"/>
a man preferably to all others, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with abhorrence and averſion. The
firſt is, in my opinion, the duty of a wife, a
duty voluntarily taken upon herſelf, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in under the moſt ſolemn contract. As
to the difficulties that may attend my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
unprovided ſtate, ſince they are the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of a virtuous action, they cannot real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be evils, nor can they diſturb that happineſs
which is the gift of virtue."—"I am heartily
glad," anſwered ſhe, "that you have found out
the art of making yourſelf happy by the force
of imagination. I wiſh your enthuſiaſm may
continue, and that you may ſtill be farther
convinced, by your own experience, of the
folly of mankind, in ſuppoſing poverty and
diſgrace to be evils."</p>
               <p>I was cut to the ſoul by the unkind manner
which accompanied this ſarcaſm, and was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to remonſtrate againſt her unfriendly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when her lover came in, with another
gentleman, who, in ſpite of my full heart,
engaged my attention, and, for a while, made
me forget the ſtings of unkindneſs. The
beauty and gracefulneſs of his perſon caught
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0803200700:148"/>
my eye, and the politeneſs of his addreſs, and
the elegance of his compliments, ſoon preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
me in favour of his underſtanding. He
was introduced by the captain to Amanda as his
moſt intimate friend, and ſeemed deſirous to
give credit to his friend's judgment, by making
himſelf as agreeable as poſſible. He ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo well, that Amanda was wholly engroſſed
by the pleaſure of his converſation, and the
care of entertaining her lover and her new
gueſt. Her face brightened and her good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
returned. When I aroſe to leave her,
ſhe preſſed me ſo earneſtly to ſtay dinner, that
I could not, without diſcovering how much I
reſented her behaviour, refuſe. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I ſhould probably have done, as I was
naturally diſpoſed to ſhew every ſentiment of
my heart, had not a ſecret wiſh ariſen there to
know a little more of this agreeable ſtranger.
This inclined me to think it prudent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
my reſentment, and to accept the civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Amanda. The converſation grew more
and more pleaſing; I took my ſhare in it; and
had more than my ſhare of the charming
ſtranger's notice and attention. As we all grew
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0803200700:149"/>
more and more unreſerved, Amanda dropped
hints in the courſe of the converſation relating
to my ſtory, my ſentiments, and unhappy ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
Sir George Freelove, for that was the
young gentleman's name, liſtened greedily to
all that was ſaid of me, and ſeemed to eye me
with an earneſt curioſity, as well as admiration.
We did not part till it was late; and Sir
George inſiſted on attending me to my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
I ſtrongly refuſed it, not without a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
which more properly belonged to the
female than the philoſopher, and which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in myſelf, as ariſing from diſhoneſt
pride.</p>
               <p>I could not, without pain, ſuffer the polite
Sir George, upon ſo ſhort an acquaintance,
to diſcover the meanneſs of my abode. To
avoid this, I ſent for a chair, but was confuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to find that Sir George and his ſervants
prepared to attend it on foot, by way of guard.
It was in vain to diſpute: he himſelf walked
before, and his ſervants followed it. I was
covered with bluſhes, when, after all this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,
he handed me in at the little ſhop door,
and took leave with as profound reſpect, as if
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0803200700:150"/>
he had guarded me into a palace. A thouſand
different thoughts kept me from cloſing my
eyes that night. The behaviour of Amanda
wounded me to the ſoul: I found that I muſt
look on her as no more than a common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and that the world did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
one perſon whom I could call my friend.
My heart felt deſolate and forlorn. I knew
not what courſe to take for my future ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The pain which my pride had juſt
given me, convinced me that I was far from
having conquered the paſſions of humanity,
and that I ſhould feel too ſenſibly all the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
which attend on poverty. I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
however, to ſubdue this pride, and call
to my aſſiſtance the example of ancient ſages
and philoſophers, who deſpiſed riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and felt no inconveniencies from the
malice of fortune. I had almoſt reaſoned my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into a contempt for the world, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
myſelf ſuperior to its ſmiles or frowns,
when the idea of Sir George Freelove ruſhed
upon my mind, and deſtroyed, at once, the
whole force of my reaſoning. I found that,
however I might diſregard the reſt of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0803200700:151"/>
world, I could not be indiffernt to his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and the thought of being deſpiſed by
him was inſupportable. I recollected that my
condition was extremely different from that of
an old philoſopher, whoſe rags, perhaps, were
the means of gratifying his pride, by attracting
the notice and reſpect of mankind: at leaſt,
the philoſopher's ſchemes and wiſhes were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different from thoſe which, at that time,
were taking poſſeſſion of my heart. The
looks and behaviour of Sir George, left me
no doubt, that I had made as deep an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in his favour as he had done in mine. I
could not bear to loſe the ground I had gained,
and to throw myſelf into a ſtate below his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
I ſcorned the thought of impoſing on
him with regard to my circumſtances, in caſe
he ſhould really have had favourable intentions
for me; yet to diſgrace myſelf for ever in his
eye, by ſubmitting to ſervitude, or any low
way of ſupporting myſelf, was what I could
not bring myſelf to reſolve on.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of theſe reflections. I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed,
the next morning, by a viſit from Sir
George. He made reſpectful apologies for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0803200700:152"/>
the liberty he took; told me he had learned
from my friend, that the unkindneſs and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of an uncle had caſt me into uneaſy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
and that he could not know that
ſo much beauty and merit were ſo unworthily
treated by fortune, without earneſtly wiſhing
to be the inſtrument of doing me more juſtice.
He entreated me to add dignity and value to
his life, by making it conducive to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of mine; and was going on with the moſt
fervent offers of ſervice, when I interrupted
him, by ſaying that there was nothing in his
power that I could with honour accept, by
which my life could be made happier, but that
reſpect which was due to me as a woman and
a gentlewoman, and which ought to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
ſuch offers of ſervice from a ſtranger,
as could only be juſtified by a long-experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
friendſhip; that I was not in a ſituation
to receive viſits, and muſt decline his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
which, nevertheleſs, in a happier
part of my life would have given me pleaſure.</p>
               <p>He now had recourſe to all the arts of his
ſex, imputing his too great freedom to the force
of his paſſion, proteſting the moſt inviolable
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0803200700:153"/>
reſpect, and imploring on his knees, and even
with tears, that I would not puniſh him ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,
as to deny him the liberty of ſeeing
me, and making himſelf more and more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of my eſteem. My weak heart was but
too much touched by his artifices, and I had
only juſt fortitude enough to perſevere in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
his viſits, and to inſiſt on his leaving
me, which at laſt he did; but with ſuch a
profuſion of tenderneſs, prayers, and proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that it was ſome time before I could
recal my reaſon enough to reflect on the
whole of his behaviour, and on my own ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
which compared, left me but little doubt
of his diſhonourable views.</p>
               <p>I determined never more to admit him to
my preſence, and accordingly gave orders to
be denied, if he came again. My reaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded,
but my heart reproached me, and
heavily repined at the rigid determination of
prudence. I knew that I acted rightly, and I
expected that that conſciouſneſs would make
me happy; but I found it otherwiſe, I was
wretched beyond what I had ever felt, or
formed any idea of. I diſcovered that my
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0803200700:154"/>
heart was entangled in a paſſion which muſt
for ever be combated, or indulged at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of virtue. I now conſidered riches as
truly deſirable, ſince they would have placed
me above diſgraceful attempts, and given me
reaſonable hopes of becoming the wife of Sir
George Freelove. I was diſcontented and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
but ſurpriſed and diſappointed to find
myſelf ſo, ſince hitherto I had no one crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
action to reproach myſelf with; on the
contrary, my difficulties were all owing to my
regard for virtue.</p>
               <p>I reſolved, however, to try ſtill farther the
power of virtue to confer happineſs, to go on
in my obedience to her laws, and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wait the good effects of it. But I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ſtronger difficulties to go through than any I
had yet experienced: Sir George was too
much practiſed in the arts of ſeduction to be
diſcouraged by a firſt repulſe, every day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
either ſome new attempt to ſee me, or
a letter full of the moſt paſſionate proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and entreaties for pardon and favour: it
was in vain I gave orders that no more letters
ſhould be taken in from him: he had ſo many
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0803200700:155"/>
different contrivances to convey them, and
directed them in hands ſo unlike, that I was
ſurpriſed into reading them, contrary to my
intentions. Every time I ſtirred out, he was
ſure to be in my way, and to employ the moſt
artful tongue that ever enſnared the heart of
woman, in blinding my reaſon and awakening
my paſſions.</p>
               <p>My virtue, however, did not yet give way,
but my peace of mind was utterly deſtroyed.
Whenever I was with him, I ſummoned all
my fortitude, and conſtantly repeated my
commands, that he ſhould avoid me: his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
called for my reſentment, and, in
ſpite of my melting heart, I armed my eyes
with anger, and treated him with as much
diſdain as I thought his unworthy deſigns
deſerved. But the moment he left me, all
my reſolution forſook me, I repined at my
fate, I even murmured againſt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Ruler of all things, for making me
ſubject to paſſions I could not ſubdue, yet
muſt not indulge. I compared my own ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
with that of my libertine couſin, whoſe
pernicious arguments I had heard with horror
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0803200700:156"/>
and deteſtation; who gave the reins to every
deſire; whoſe houſe was the ſeat of plenty,
mirth, and delight; whoſe face was ever cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſmiles; and whoſe heart ſeemed free
from ſorrow and care. Is not this man, ſaid I,
happier than I am? and if ſo, where is the
worth of virtue? Have I not ſacrificed to her
my fortune and my friends? Do I not daily
ſacrifice to her my darling inclination; yet,
what is the compenſation ſhe offers me?
What are my proſpects in this world but
poverty, mortification, diſappointment, and
grief? Every wiſh of my heart denied, every
paſſion of humanity combated and hurt, though
never conquered! Are theſe the bleſſings
with which Heaven diſtinguiſhes it favourites?
Can the King of Heaven want power or
will to diſtinguiſh them? or does he leave
his wretched creatures the ſport of chance,
the prey of wickedneſs and malice? Surely
no. Yet is not the condition of the virtuous
often more miſerable than that of the vicious?
I myſelf have experienced that it is. I am
very unhappy, and ſee no likelihood of my
being otherwiſe in this world—and all beyond
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0803200700:157"/>
the grave is eternal darkneſs. Yet why do I
ſay that I have no proſpect of happineſs? does
not the moſt engaging of men offer me all the
joys that love and fortune can beſtow? Will
not he protect me from every inſult of the
proud world that ſcoffs at indigence? Will
not his liberal hand pour forth the means of
every pleaſure, even of that higheſt and trueſt
of all pleaſure, the power of relieving the
ſufferings of my fellow-creatures, of changing
the tears of diſtreſs into tears of joy and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
of communicating my own happineſs to
all around me? Is not this a ſtate far prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that in which virtue has placed me?
But what is virtue? Is not happineſs the laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
purſuit of reaſon? Is it not then laudable
to purſue it by the moſt probable means?
Have I not been accuſing Providence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs,
whilſt I myſelf only am in fault for
rejecting its offered favours? Surely, I have
miſtaken the path of virtue: it muſt be that
which leads to happineſs. The path which I
am in is full of thorns and briars, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
in impenetrable darkneſs; but I ſee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
that is ſtrewed with flowers, and bright
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0803200700:158"/>
with the ſun ſhine of proſperity: this, ſurely,
is the path of virtue and the road to happineſs.
Hither then let me turn my weary ſteps, nor
let vain and idle prejudices fright me from fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
It is ſurely impoſſible that I ſhould
offend God, by yielding to a temptation which
he has given me no motive to reſiſt. He has
allotted me a ſhort and precarious exiſtence,
and has placed before me good and evil. What
is good but pleaſure? What is evil but pain?
Reaſon and nature direct me to chuſe the firſt,
and avoid the laſt. I ſought for happineſs in
what is called virtue, but I found it not: ſhall
I not try the other experiment, ſince I think
I can hardly be more unhappy by following
inclination, than I am by denying it?</p>
               <p>Thus had my frail thoughts wandered into
a wilderneſs of error, and thus had I almoſt
reaſoned myſelf out of every principle of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
by purſuing, through all their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
the doctrines which had been taught
me as rules of life and preſcriptions for felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the taliſinans of truth, by which I ſhould be
ſecured in the ſtorms of adverſity, and liſten
without danger to the ſyrens of temptation;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0803200700:159"/>
when, in the fatal hour of my preſumption,
ſitting alone in my chamber, collecting argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on the ſide of paſſion, almoſt diſtracted
with doubts, and plunging deeper and deeper
into falſehood, I ſaw Sir George Freelove at
my feet, who had gained admittance, contrary
to my orders, by corrupting my landlady. It
is not neceſſary to deſcribe to you his arts, or
the weak effects of that virtue which had been
graciouſly implanted in my heart, but which I
had taken impious means to undermine by falſe
reaſoning, and which now tottered from the
foundation: ſuſſice it that I ſubmitted to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
I have ſo well deſerved, and tell you,
that, in the pride of human reaſon I dared to
condemn, as the effect of weakneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
the ſtill voice of conſcience, which
would yet have warned me from ruin; that my
innocence, my honour was the ſacrifice to
paſſion and ſophiſtry; that my boaſted philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
and too much ſlattered underſtanding,
preſerved me not from the loweſt depth of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamy,
which the weakeſt of my ſex with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and religion would have avoided.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0803200700:160"/>
I now experienced a new kind of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs:
my vile ſeducer tried in vain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
me to the ſhameful life to which he
had reduced me, by loading me with finery,
and laviſhing his fortune in procuring me plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
which I could not taſte, and pomp which
ſeemed an inſult on my diſgrace. In vain did
I recollect the arguments which had convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me of the lawfulneſs of accepting offered
pleaſures, and following the dictates of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
The light of my underſtanding was
darkened, but the ſenſe of guilt was not loſt:
my pride and my delicacy, if, criminal as I
was, I may dare to call it ſo, ſuffered the moſt
intolerable mortification and diſguſt every time
I reflected on my infamous ſituation. Every
eye ſeemed to upbraid me, even that of my
triumphant ſeducer. O depth of miſery! to
be conſcious of deſerving the contempt of him
I loved, and for whoſe ſake I was become
contemptible to myſelf.</p>
               <p>This was the ſtate of my mind during a
year which I paſſed in Sir George's houſe:
his fondneſs was unabated for eight months of
the time; and as I had no other object to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0803200700:161"/>
ſhare my attention, neither friend nor relation
to call off any part of my tenderneſs, all the
love of a heart naturally affectionate centered
in him. The firſt dawnings of unkindneſs were
but too viſible to my watchful eyes. I had
now all the torments of jealouſy to endure,
till a cruel certainty put an end to them; I
learnt, at length, that my falſe lover was on
the brink of marriage with a lady of great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
I immediately reſolved to leave him,
but could not do it without firſt venting my
full heart in complaints and reproaches. This
provoked his rage, and drew on me inſolence,
which, though I had deſerved, I had not
learnt to bear. I returned with ſcorn, which
no longer became me, all the wages of my ſin,
and the trappings of my ſhame, and left his
houſe in the bittereſt anguiſh of reſentment
and deſpair.</p>
               <p>I returned to my old lodgings; but unable to
bear a ſcene which recalled every circumſtance
of my undoing, aſhamed to look in the fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of any creature who had ſeen me innocent,
wretched in myſelf, and hoping from change
of place ſome abatement of my miſery, I p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0803200700:162"/>
myſelf into a poſt-chaiſe at two in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with orders to the driver to carry me as
far from town as he could before the return of
night, leaving it to him to chuſe the road.</p>
               <p>My reaſon and my ſenſes ſeemed benumbed
and ſtupified during my journey. I made no
reflections on what I was about, nor formed
any deſign for my future life. When night
came, my conductor would have ſtopped at a
large town, but I bid him go on to the next
village: there I alighted at a paltry inn, and
diſmiſſed my vehicle, without once conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what I was to do with myſelf, or why I
choſe that place for my abode. To ſay truth,
I can give no account of my thoughts at this
period of time: they were all confuſed and
diſtracted. A ſhort frenzy muſt have filled up
thoſe hours, of which my memory retains ſuch
imperfect traces. I remember only, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having pulled off my clothes, I left the
inn as ſoon as I ſaw the day, and wandered
out of the village.</p>
               <p>My unguided feet carried me to a range of
willows by a river's ſide, where, after having
walked ſome time, the freſhneſs of the air re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0803200700:163"/>
my ſenſes, and awakened my reaſon.
My reaſon, my memory, my anguiſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
returned together. Every circumſtance
of my paſt life was preſent to my mind; but
moſt the idea of my faithleſs lover, and my
criminal love tortured my imagination and
rent my bleeding heart, which, in ſpite of all its
guilt and all its wrongs, retained the tendereſt
and moſt ardent affection for its undo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r. This
unguarded affection, which was the effect of a
gentle and kind nature, heightened the anguiſh
of reſentment, and compleated my miſery.
In vain did I call off my thoughts from this
gloomy retroſpect, and hope to find a gleam of
comfort in my future proſpects. They were
ſtill more dreadful: poverty, attended by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
and want groaning under the cruel hand
of oppreſſion, and the taunts of inſolence were
before my eyes. I, who had once been the
darling and the pride of indulgent parents,
who had once been beloved, reſpected, and
admired, was now the outcaſt of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
deſpiſed and avoided by all who had
ever loved me, by all whom I had moſt loved!
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0803200700:164"/>
hateful to myſelf, belonging to no one, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to wrongs and inſults from all.</p>
               <p>I tried to find out the cauſe of this diſmal
change, and how far I was myſelf the occaſion
of it. My conduct, with regard to Sir George,
though I ſpontaneouſly condemned, yet, upon
recollection, I thought the arguments which
produced it would juſtify. But as my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
could not preſerve me from vice, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could they ſuſtain me in adverſity: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
was not to be perverted by the ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which had beclouded my reaſon. And if
any, by imputing my conduct to error, ſhould
acquit me of guilt, let them remember, it is yet
true, that in this uttermoſt diſtreſs, I was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuſtained by the conſciouſneſs of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
the exultation of virtue, nor the hope of
reward: whether I looked backward or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
all was confuſion and anguiſh, diſtraction
and deſpair. I accuſed the Supreme Being
of cruelty and injuſtice, who, though he gave
me not ſufficient encouragement to reſiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
yet puniſhes me with the conſequences
of indulgence. If there is a God, cried I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0803200700:165"/>
he muſt be either tyrannical and cruel, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
of her creatures. I will no longer
endure a being which is undeſervedly miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
either from chance or deſign, but fly to
that annihilation in which all my proſpects
terminate. Take back, ſaid I, liſting my eyes
to Heaven, the hateful gift of exiſtence, and
let my duſt no more be animated to ſuffering,
and exalted to miſery.</p>
               <p>So ſaying, I ran to the brink of the river,
and was going to plunge in, when the cry of
ſome perſon very near me made me turn my
eyes to ſee whence it came. I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted
by an elderly gentleman, who, with
looks of terror, pity, and benevolence, aſked
what I was about to do? At firſt I was ſullen,
and refuſed to anſwer him: but by degrees the
compaſſion he ſhewed, and the tenderneſs
with which he treated me, ſoftened my heart,
and gave vent to my tears.</p>
               <p>"O, Madam!" ſaid he, "theſe are gracious
ſigns, and unlike thoſe which firſt drew my
attention, and made me watch you unobſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
fearing ſome fatal purpoſe in your mind.
What muſt be the thoughts which could make
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0803200700:166"/>
a face like yours appear the picture of horror?
I was taking my morning walk, and have ſeen
you a conſiderable time: ſometimes ſtopping
and wringing your hands, ſometimes quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your pace, and ſometimes walking ſlow,
with your eyes fixed on the ground, till you
raiſed them to Heaven, with looks not of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
and piety, but rather of accuſation
and defiance. For pity tell me, how it is that
you have quarrelled with yourſelf, with life,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay even with Heaven? Recal your reaſon
and your hope, and let this ſeaſonable preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your fatal purpoſe be an earneſt to you
of good things to come, of God's mercy not
yet alienated from you, and ſtooping from his
throne to ſave your ſoul from perdition?"</p>
               <p>The tears which flowed in rivers from my
eyes while he talked, gave me ſo much relief,
that I found myſelf able to ſpeak, and deſirous
to expreſs my gratitude for the good man's
concern for me. It was ſo long ſince I had
known the joys of confidence, that I felt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
pleaſure and comfort from unbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening
my heart, and telling my kind deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
every circumſtance of my ſtory, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0803200700:167"/>
every thought of my diſtracted mind. He
ſhuddered to hear me upbraid the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and ſtopping me ſhort, told me he
would lead me to one who ſhould preach pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to me whilſt ſhe gave me the example
of it.</p>
               <p>As we talked he lead me to his own houſe,
and there introduced me to his wife, a middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged
woman, pale and emaciated, but of a
cheerful placid countenance, who received
me with the greateſt tenderneſs and humanity.
She ſaw I was diſtreſſed, and her compaſſion
was before hand with my complaints. Her
tears ſtood ready to accompany mine; her
looks and her voice expreſſed the kindeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern;
and her aſſiduous cares demonſtrated that
true politeneſs and hoſpitality, which is not
the effect of art but of inward benevolence.
While ſhe obliged me to take ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
her huſband gave her a ſhort account of
my ſtory, and of the ſtate in which he found
me. "This poor lady," ſaid he, "from the
fault of her education and principles, ſees
every thing through a gloomy medium. She
accuſes Providence, and hates her exiſtence
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0803200700:168"/>
for thoſe evils which are the common lot of
mankind in this ſhort ſtate of trial. You, my
dear, who are one of the greateſt ſufferers I
have known, are beſt qualified to cure her of
her faulty impatience, and to convince her, by
your own example, that this world is not the
place in which virtue is to find its reward.
She thinks no one ſo unhappy as herſelf; but
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſhe knew all that you have gone through,
ſhe would ſurely be ſenſible, that if you are
happier than ſhe, it is only becauſe your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
are better."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, my dear madam!" ſaid ſhe,
"that is the only advantage that I have over
you; but that indeed out weighs every thing
elſe. It is now but ten days ſince I followed
to the grave my only ſon, the ſurvivor of eight
children, who were all equally the objects of
my fondeſt love: my heart is no leſs tender
than your own, nor my affections leſs warm.
For a whole year before the death of my laſt
darling, I watched the fatal progreſs of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
and ſaw him ſuffer the moſt amazing
pains. Nor was poverty, that dreaded evil, to
which you could not ſubmit, wanting to my
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0803200700:169"/>
trials: though my huſband is, by his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
a gentleman, his income is ſo ſmall, that
I and my children have often wanted neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
and though I had always a weakly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
I have helped to ſupport my family
by the labour of my own hands At this time
I am conſuming, by daily tortures, with a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
which muſt ſhortly be my death. My
pains, perhaps, might be mitigated by proper
aſſiſtance, though nothing could preſerve my
life; but I have not the means to obtain that
aſſiſtance." O, hold! interrupted I, my ſoul
is ſhocked at the enumeration of ſuch intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſufferings: how is it that you ſupport
them? Why do I not ſee you, in deſpair like
mine, renounce your exiſtence, and put your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out of the reach of torment? But, above
all, tell me how it is poſſible for you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
amidſt ſuch complicated miſery, that
appearance of cheerfulneſs and ſerene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
which ſhines ſo remarkably in your
countenance, and animates every look and
motion.</p>
               <p>"That cheerfulneſs and complacency," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the good woman, "I feel in my heart.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0803200700:170"/>
My mind is not only ſerene, but often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
the higheſt emotions of joy and exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the brighteſt hopes can give." And
whence, ſaid I, do you derive this aſtoniſhing
art of extracting joy from miſery, and of ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amidſt all the terrors of pain, ſorrow, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
and death? She was ſilent for a moment,
then ſtepping to her cloſet, reached a Bible,
which ſhe put into my hands: "See there,"
ſaid ſhe, "the volume in which I have learnt
this art. Here I am taught, that everlaſting
glory is in ſtore for all who will accept it
upon the terms which Infinite Perfection has
preſcribed; here I am promiſed conſolation,
aſſiſtance, and ſupport from the Lord of Life;
and here I am aſſured, that my tranſient af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> eternal
and unſpeakable happineſs. This happineſs is
at hand. The ſhort remainder of my life
ſeems but a point, beyond which opens the
glorious proſpect of immortality: thus encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
how ſhould I be dejected? Thus ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
how ſhould I ſink? With ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
ſuch aſſured hopes, how can I be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

While ſhe ſpoke, her eyes ſparkled, and her
whole face ſeemed animated with joy. I was
ſtruck with her manner, as well as her words.
Every ſyllable ſhe uttered ſeemed to ſink into
my ſoul, ſo that I never can forget it. I
reſolved to examine a religion, which was
capable of producing ſuch effects as I could
not attribute either to chance or error. The
good couple preſſed me, with ſo much unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
kindneſs, to make their little parſonage
my aſylum till I could better diſpoſe of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that I accepted their offer. Here, with
the aſſiſtance of the clergyman, who is a plain,
ſenſible, and truly pious man, I have ſtudied
the Holy Scriptures, and the evidences of
their authority. But after reading them with
candour and attention, I found all the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic
arguments of their truth ſuperfluous: the
excellency of their precepts, the conſiſtency
of their doctrines, and the glorious motives
and encouragements to virtue which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
together with the ſtriking example I
had before my eyes of their ſalutary effects,
left me no doubt of their divine authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0803200700:172"/>
During the time of my abode here, I have
been witneſs to the more than heroic, the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the triumphant death of the dear good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
With as much ſoftneſs and tenderneſs as
I ever ſaw in a female character, ſhe ſhewed
more dauntleſs intrepidity than the ſterneſt
philoſopher, or the proudeſt hero. No tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could ſhake the conſtancy of her ſoul,
or length of pain wear out the ſtrength of her
patience. Death was to her an object not of
horror but of hope. When I heard her pour
forth her laſt breath in thankſgiving, and ſaw
the ſmile of extaſy remain on her pale face
when life was fled, I could not help crying
out in the beautiful language I had lately
learnt from the Sacred Writings, "O Death!
where is thy ſting? O Grave! where is thy
victory?"</p>
               <p>I am now preparing to leave my excellent
benefactor, and get my bread in a ſervice, to
which he has recommended me in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
family. A ſtate of ſervitude, to
which once I could not reſolve to yield, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
no longer dreadful to me; that pride,
which would have made it galling, Chriſtianity
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0803200700:173"/>
has ſubdued, though philoſophy attempted it in
vain. As a penitent, I ſhould gratefully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to mortification; but as a Chriſtian, I find
myſelf ſuperior to every mortification, except
the ſenſe of guilt. This has humbled me to
the duſt: but the aſſurances that are given me
by the Saviour of the world of the divine
pardon and favour, upon ſincere repentance,
have calmed my troubled ſpirit, and filled
my mind with peace and joy, which the world
can neither give nor take away. Thus, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any change for the better in my outward
circumſtances, I find myſelf changed from a
diſtracted, poor, deſpairing wretch, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
happy, grateful being; thankful for,
and pleaſed with my preſent ſtate of exiſtence;
yet exulting in the hope of quitting it for end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
glory and happineſs.</p>
               <p>O! Sir, tell the unthinking mortals, who
will not take the pains of enquiring into thoſe
truths which moſt concern them, and who are
led by faſhion, and the pride of human reaſon,
into a contempt for the ſacred oracles of God,
tell them this truth, which experience hath
taught me, that though vice is conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0803200700:174"/>
by miſery, virtue itſelf cannot confer
happineſs in this world, except it is animated
with the hopes of eternal bliſs in the world to
come.</p>
