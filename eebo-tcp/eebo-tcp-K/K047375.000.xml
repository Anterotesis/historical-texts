            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is really a tormenting thing to be a man of ſuch conſequence. I don't wonder now, that the Eaſtern monarchs ſuffer themſelves to be ſeen ſo ſeldom; for, in good truth, the homage that attends greatneſs is very troubleſome to men of indolent habits.</p>

Valencia is a pretty province; but for the neighbourhood, my good fellow, that, you muſt ſuppoſe, is moſt diabolical to a man like me, uſed not only to the ſociety of Madrid, but who have lived in London and Paris.

No, no, Diego; Engliſhmen are the only people who never conſider change of place, but are juſt the ſame harum-ſcarum mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caps in all parts of the world as they are at home: quite as ready to make an uproar in the court of the Great Mogul, as to break a lamp within the liberties of Weſtminſter.</p>

                  <p>Surely my maſter, Don Miguel de Lara, is the laſt man in the world that I ſhould have ſuſpected of accepting a poſt in the Holy Office. He uſed to be the moſt friendly, good-humoured old fellow in all Spain: what then could induce him to become an Inquiſitor? He is mightily altered, and yet, ſomehow, the change is only ſuperficial. He frowns at every body, and hardly ſpeaks a kind word; but I have reaſon to think his heart is as humane as ever. He has ſent me to ſeek out a melancholy being who, as he underſtands, chooſes to live in this lonely place. A man can't be void of tenderneſs who courts the ſociety of the unfortunate.—This muſt be the perſon I am ſent to—I'll obſerve him a little, before I accoſt him.</p>

                     <p>What! is that tribunal grown impolitic in cruelty, to ſeek a wretch like me to wreak its vengeance on? Thoſe who delight in human miſery ſhould ſingle out the happy, and force the groan of anguiſh from the heart that ne'er knew aught but rapture: I am ſo pre-eminent in wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that I can look with tranquil eye on all the horrors of the infernal court—miſnamed the Holy! Can its gloomy caverns terrify the man who loaths the ſight of day? can eternal ſilence be a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him to whom all converſe with mankind is hateful? or can the flames which fold around the victim of its wrath, equal the fire which burns within my boſom? No, no; the flames which kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle at the ſtake, poſſeſs the mercy too to counteract the vengeance that employs them, and ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the ſufferer to eternal peace; while here, here in this tortured heart, a fire more painful rages, and yet will not deſtroy.</p>

Some pleaſant little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be tried, no doubt. What!—A woman! My dear, dear Madam, if you have a grain of compaſſion—Hey!—It is ſhe!

my dear little girl. I thought to find her ſo ſnug and ſo cozey at the village where I ordered my man Pat to conduct her. Sure honeſt Pat has n't turned out a big rogue, and carried her back to the convent! Blood and fury! Why did I leave her in any body's care, without ſtaying myſelf to ſee that they did as I ordered them? I am in a pretty kind of a hobble.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1182701800:50"/>
whoſe dear remembrance her faithful boſom che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, while he may have abandoned her, and heape ſuch anguiſh on that heart, as falſehood hath lodged here. Let me behold the face of her whoſe ſorrows I conceive akin to mine. Immortal powers!

No, no! 'Tis ſhe, and ſent, that death, death by his hand ſhe hath wronged, may expiate her perfidy. Why does my heart ſhrink from an act of juſtice? How miſery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms reſentment! Yes, yes; 'tis that unnerves me. Did I behold her in the hall of ſplendour, decked in the robes of gaiety, her eyes ſparkling with bliſs, then ſhould I ruſh eager for vengeance, and exult to lay triumphant guilt in ruin. But here I view a wretched creature whom Heaven's hand hath humbled. Is that pale cheek, where ſufferance is marked with care's ſure traces—is that a ſtimulant to vengeance? Poor ill-fated girl! Thy heart has played thee treacherouſly—it wanted firmneſs to prevent thy falſehood, and yet has not been ſlack to upbraid thee with it. I did not think to have wept for thee, frail Angelina; but thus, thus fallen, even I can pity thee. <stage>
