            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THIS is the only Book of the Iliad which is a continued Deſcription of a Battel, without any Digreſſion or Epiſode, that ſerves for an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to refreſh the Reader. The heav'nly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines too are fewer than in any other. <hi>Homer</hi> ſeems to have truſted wholly to the Force of his own Genius, as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſupport him, whatſoever lengths he was carried by it. But that Spirit which animates the Original, is what I am ſenſible evaporates ſo much in my Hands; that, tho' I can't think my Author tedious, I ſhould have made him ſeem ſo, if I had not tranſlated this Book with all poſſible Conciſeneſs. I hope there is nothing material omitted, tho' the Verſion conſiſts but of ſixty five Lines more than the Original.</p>
                  <p>However, one may obſerve there are more Turns of Fortune, more Defeats, more Rallyings, more Accidents, in this Battel, than in any other; becauſe it was to be the laſt wherein the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> were upon equal Terms, before the Return of <hi>Achilles:</hi> And beſides, all this ſerves to introduce the chief Hero with the greater Pomp and Dignity.</p>

                  <p>The Diſſimilitude of Manners between theſe two Friends, <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus,</hi> is very obſervable: Such Friendſhips are not uncommon, and I have often aſſign'd this Reaſon for them, that it is natural for Men to ſeek the Aſſiſtance of thoſe Qualities in others, which they want themſelves.

                  </p>
                  <p>M. <hi>l' Abbè Teraſſon</hi> (in his Diſſertation on the Iliad) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prove that <hi>Longinus</hi> has miſrepreſented the whole Context and Senſe of this Paſſage of <hi>Homer.</hi> The Fact (ſays he) is, that <hi>Ajax</hi> is in a very different Situation in <hi>Homer</hi> from that wherein <hi>Longinus</hi> deſcribes him. He has not the leaſt Intention of fighting, he thinks only of finding out ſome fit Perſon to ſend to <hi>Achilles;</hi> and this Darkneſs hindering him from ſeeing ſuch an one, is the occaſion of his Prayer. Accordingly it appears by what follows, that as ſoon as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> has diſpers'd the Cloud, <hi>Ajax</hi> never falls upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but in conſequence of his former Thought orders <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus</hi> to look for <hi>Antilochus,</hi> to diſpatch him to <hi>Achilles</hi> with the News of the Death of his Friend. <hi>Longinus</hi> (continues this Author) had certainly forgot the Place from whence he took this Thought; and it is not the firſt Citation from <hi>Homer</hi> which the Ancients have quoted wrong. Thus <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> attributes to <hi>Calypſo,</hi> the Words of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in the twelfth Book of the Odyſſeis; and confounds together two Paſſages, one of the ſecond, the other of the fifteenth Book of the Iliad. [<hi>Ethic. ad Nicom.</hi> l. 2. c. 9. and l. 3. c. 11.] And thus <hi>Cicero</hi> aſcribed to <hi>Agamemnon</hi> a long Diſcourſe of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in the ſecond Iliad; [<hi>De divinatione</hi> l. 2.] and cited as <hi>Ajax</hi>'s, the Speech of <hi>Hector</hi> in the ſeventh. [See <hi>Aul. Gellius</hi> l. 15. c. 6.] One has no cauſe to wonder at this, ſince the Ancients having <hi>Homer</hi> almoſt by heart, were for that very Reaſon the more ſubject to miſtake in citing him by Memory.</p>
                  <p>To this I think one may anſwer, that granting it was partly the Occaſion of <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Prayer to obtain Light, in order to ſend to <hi>Achilles</hi> (which he afterwards does) yet the Thought which <hi>Longinus</hi> attributes to him, is very conſiſtent with it; and the laſt Line expreſſes nothing elſe but an

It was therefore neceſſary that his Work ſhould be above that of Men: To effect this, the Tripods were animated, and in this <hi>Homer</hi> doth not deviate from the Probability; for every one is fully perſuaded, that a God can do things more difficult than theſe, and that all Matter will obey him. What has not been ſaid of the Statues of <hi>Daedalus? Plato</hi> writes, that they walked alone, and if they had not taken care to tie them, they would have got looſe, and run from their Maſter. If a Writer in Proſe can ſpeak hyperbollically of a Man, may not <hi>Homer</hi> do it much more of a God? Nay, this Circumſtance with which <hi>Homer</hi> has embelliſh'd his Poem, would have had nothing too ſurprizing tho' theſe Tripods had been made by a Man; for what may not be done in Clock-work by an exact Management of Springs?

                  <p>I deſign to give the Reader the Sum of what has been ſaid on this Subject.

                     <p>It is the Fate (ſays M. <hi>Dacier</hi>) of theſe Arms of <hi>Achilles,</hi> to be ſtill the Occaſion of Quarrels and Diſputes. <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> was the firſt who appear'd againſt this Part, and was follow'd by a whole Herd. Theſe object in the firſt place, that 'tis impoſſible to repreſent the Movement of the Figures; and in condemning the manner, they take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to condemn alſo the Subject, which they ſay is trivial, and not well underſtood. 'Tis certain that <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeaks of the Figures on this Buckler, as if they were alive: And ſome of the Ancients taking his Expreſſions to the Strictneſs of the Letter, did really believe that they had all ſorts of Motion. <hi>Euſtathius</hi> ſhewed the Abſurdity of that Sentiment by a Paſſage of <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That Poet, ſays he, to ſhew that his Figures are not animated, as ſome have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by an exceſſive Affection for the Prodigious, took care to ſay that they <hi>moved and fought,</hi> as if <hi>they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Men.</hi>"</q> The Ancients certainly founded this ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Opinion on a Rule of <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> For they thought the Poet could not make his Deſcription more <hi>admirable</hi> and <hi>marvellous,</hi> than in making his Figures animated, ſince (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays) the <hi>Original ſhould always excel the Copy.</hi> That Shield is the Work of a God: 'Tis the Original, of which the Engraving and Painting of Men is but an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Copy; and there is nothing impoſſible to the Gods. But they did not perceive, that by this <hi>Homer</hi> would have
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0356200105:132"/>
fallen into an extravagant Admirable which would not have been probable. Therefore, 'tis without any Neceſſity <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtathius</hi> adds, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That 'tis poſſible all thoſe Figures did not ſtick cloſe to the Shield, but that they were detach'd from it, and mov'd by Springs, in ſuch a manner that they appear'd to have Motion; as <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> has feign'd ſomething like it, in his <hi>ſeven Captains againſt</hi> Thebes."</q> But without having recourſe to that C0onjecture, we can ſhew that there is nothing more ſimple and natural than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of that Shield, and there is not one Word which <hi>Homer</hi> might not have ſaid of it, if it had been the Work of a Man; for there is a great deal of difference between the Work itſelf, and the Deſcription of it.</p>
                     <p>Let us examine the Particulars for which they blame <hi>Homer.</hi> They ſay he deſcribes two Towns on his Shield which <hi>ſpeak different Languages.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not <hi>Homer,</hi> that ſays ſo; the Word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, is a common Epithet of Men, and which ſignifies only, that they have <hi>an articulate Voice.</hi> Theſe Towns could not ſpeak different Languages, ſince, as the Ancients have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, they were <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Eleuſina,</hi> both which ſpake the ſame Language. But tho' that Epithet ſhould ſignify, <hi>which ſpake different Languages,</hi> there would be nothing very ſurprizing; for <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaid what <hi>Homer</hi> it ſeems muſt not:<q>
                           <l>Victae longo ordine gentes,</l>

                           <bibl>Aen. 8.</bibl>
                        </q> If a Painter ſhould put into a Picture one Town of <hi>France</hi> and another of <hi>Flanders,</hi> might not one ſay they were two Towns which ſpake different Languages?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Homer</hi> (they tell us) ſays in another place; that <hi>we hear the Harangues of two Pleaders.</hi> This is an unfair Exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He only ſays, <hi>Two Men pleaded,</hi> that is, were repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pleading. Was not the ſame ſaid by <hi>Pliny</hi> of <hi>Nicomachus,</hi> that he had painted two <hi>Greeks,</hi> which ſpake one after another? Can we expreſs ourſelves otherwiſe of theſe two Arts, which tho' they are mute, yet have a Language?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0356200105:133"/>
Or in explaining a Painting of <hi>Raphael</hi> or <hi>Pouſſin,</hi> can we prevent animating the Figures, in making them ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to the Deſign of the Painter? But how could the Engraver repreſent thoſe young Shepherds and Virgins that dance firſt in a Ring, and then in Setts? Or thoſe Troops which were in Ambuſcade? This would be difficult indeed if the Workman had not the Liberty to make his Perſons appear in different Circumſtances. All the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the young Man who ſings at the ſame time that he plays on the Harp, the Bull that roars whilſt he is devoured by a Lion, and againſt the muſical Conſorts, are childiſh; for we can never ſpeak of Painting if we baniſh thoſe Expreſſions. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays of <hi>Apelles,</hi> that he paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Clytus</hi> on Horſeback going to Battel, and demanding his Helmet of his Squire: Of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> that he drew a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar whom we could almoſt underſtand, <hi>pene cum voce:</hi> Of <hi>Cteſilochus,</hi> that he had painted <hi>Jupiter</hi> bringing forth <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and crying out like a Woman, <hi>&amp; muliebriter ingemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centem:</hi> And of <hi>Nicearchus,</hi> that he had drawn a Piece, in which <hi>Hercules</hi> was ſeen very melancholy for having been a Fool, <hi>Herculem triſtem, Inſaniae poenitentiâ.</hi> No one ſure will condemn thoſe ways of Expreſſion which are ſo common. The ſame Author has ſaid much more of <hi>Apelles,</hi> he tells us, he painted thoſe things which could not be painted, as Thunder; <hi>Pinxit quae pingi non poſſunt:</hi> And of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus,</hi> that in all his Works there was ſomething more underſtood than was ſeen; and tho' there was all the Art imaginable, yet there was ſtill more Ingenuity than Art: <hi>Atque in omnibus ejus operibus, intelligitur plus ſemper quàm pingitur; &amp; cùm Ars ſumma ſit, Ingenium tamen ultra Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem eſt.</hi> If we take the pains to compare theſe Expreſſions with thoſe of <hi>Homer,</hi> we ſhall find him altogether excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his <hi>Manner</hi> of deſcribing the Buckler.</p>
                     <p>We come now to the <hi>Matter.</hi> If this Shield (ſays a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Critick) had been made in a wiſer Age, it would have been more correct and leſs charg'd with Objects. There are two things which cauſe the Cenſurers to fall into this falſe Criticiſm: The firſt is, that they think the Shield was no broader than the brims of a Hat, whereas it was large enough
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0356200105:134"/>
to cover a whole Man. The other is, that they did not know the Deſign of the Poet, and imagined this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription was only the Whimſy of an irregular Wit, who did it by chance, and not following Nature; for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as enter'd into the Intention of the Poet, nor knew the Shield was deſign'd as a Repreſentation of the Univerſe.</p>
                     <p>'Tis happy that <hi>Virgil</hi> has made a Buckler for <hi>Aeneas,</hi> as well as <hi>Homer</hi> for <hi>Achilles.</hi> The <hi>Latin</hi> Poet, who imitated the <hi>Greek</hi> one, always took care to accommodate thoſe things which Time had chang'd, ſo as to render them agreeable to the Palate of his Readers; yet he hath not only charg'd his Shield with a great deal more Work, ſince he paints all the Actions of the <hi>Romans</hi> from <hi>Aſcanius</hi> to <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> but has not avoided any of thoſe manners of Expreſſion which offend the Criticks. We ſee there the Wolf of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> who gives them her Dugs <hi>one after another, Mulcere alternos, &amp; Corpora fingere Linguâ:</hi> The Rape of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> and the War which follow'd it, <hi>ſubitoque novum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgere Bellum: Metius</hi> torn by four Horſes, and <hi>Tullus</hi> who draws his Entrails thro' the Foreſt: <hi>Porſenna</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the <hi>Romans</hi> to receive <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and beſieging <hi>Rome:</hi> The Geeſe flying to the Porches of the Capitol, and giving notice by their <hi>Cries</hi> of the Attack of the <hi>Gauls.</hi>

                        </q> Nothing can better juſtify <hi>Homer,</hi> or ſhew the Wiſdom and Judgment of <hi>Virgil:</hi> He was charm'd with <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Shield, and therefore would give the ſame Ornament to his Poem. But as <hi>Homer</hi> had painted the Univerſe, he was ſenſible that nothing remain'd for him to do; he had no other way to take than that of Prophecy, and ſhew what the Deſcendant of his Hero ſhould perform; and he was not afraid to go beyond <hi>Homer,</hi> becauſe there is nothing improbable in the Hands of a God. If the Criticks ſay, that this is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying one Fault by another; I deſire they would agree among themſelves; for <hi>Scaliger,</hi> who was the firſt that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd <hi>Homer</hi>'s Shield, admires <hi>Virgil</hi>'s; but ſuppoſe they ſhould agree, 'twould be fooliſh to endeavour to perſuade us, that what <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have done by the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of all Ages, is not good; and to make us think that their particular Taſte ſhould prevail over that of all other Men. Nothing is more ridiculous than to trouble one's ſelf to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Men, who ſhew ſo little Reaſon in their Criticiſms, that we can do them no greater Favour, than to aſcribe it to their Ignorance.</p>
                     <p>Thus far the Objections are anſwer'd by Monſ. <hi>Dacier.</hi> Since when, ſome others have been ſtarted, as that the Objects repreſented on the Buckler have no reference to the Poem, no Agreement with <hi>Thetis</hi> who procur'd it, <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oan</hi> who made it, or <hi>Achilles</hi> for whom it was made.</p>

                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0356200105:136"/>
To this it is reply'd, that the Repreſentation of the Sea was agreeable enough to <hi>Thetis;</hi> that the Spheres and celeſtial Fires were ſo to <hi>Vulcan;</hi> (tho' the truth is, any piece of Workmanſhip was equally fit to come from the Hands of this God) and that the Images of a Town beſieg'd, a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and an Ambuſcade, were Objects ſufficiently proper for <hi>Achilles.</hi> But after all, where was the Neceſſity that they ſhould be ſo? They had at leaſt been as fit for one Hero as for another; and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> tells us, knew not what to make of the Figures on his Shield.<q>

                     <p>But ſtill the main Objection, and that in which the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Moderns has triumph'd the moſt, is, that the Shield is crowded with ſuch a Multiplicity of Figures, as could not poſſibly be repreſented in the Compaſs of it. The late Diſſertation of Monſ. <hi>Boivin</hi> has put an end to this Cavil, and the Reader will have the Pleaſure to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it by ocular Demonſtration, in the Print annexed.</p>
                     <p>This Author ſuppoſes the Buckler to have been perfectly round: He divides the convex Surface into four concentrick Circles.</p>
                     <p>The Circle next the Center contains the Globe of the Earth and the Sea, in miniature; He gives this Circle the Dimenſion of three Inches.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Circle is allotted for the Heavens and the Stars: He allows the Space of ten Inches between this, and the former Circle.</p>
                     <p>The third ſhall be eight Inches diſtant from the ſecond. The Space between theſe two Circles ſhall be divided into twelve Compartiments, each of which makes a Picture of ten or eleven Inches deep.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Circle makes the Margin of the Buckler: And the Interval between this and the former, being of three Inches, is ſufficient to repreſent the Waves and Currents of the Ocean.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0356200105:137"/>
All theſe together make but four Foot in the whole in Diameter. The Print of theſe Circles and Diviſions will ſerve to prove, that the Figures will neither be crowded nor confuſed, if diſpoſed in the proper Place and Order.</p>
                     <p>As to the Size and Figure of the Shield, it is evident from the Poets, that in the time of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War there were Shields of an extraordinary Magnitude. The Buckler of <hi>Ajax</hi> is often compar'd by <hi>Homer</hi> to a Tower, and in the ſixth Iliad that of <hi>Hector</hi> is deſcribed to cover him from the Shoulders to the Ankles.<q>

                     <p>IT having been now ſhewn, that the Shield of <hi>Homer</hi> is blameleſs as to its Deſign and Diſpoſition, and that the Subject (ſo extenſive as it is) may be contracted within the due Limits; not being one vaſt unproportion'd Heap of Figures, but divided into twelve regular Compartiments. What remains, is to conſider this Piece as a complete <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Painting,</hi> and a Sketch for what one may call an <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Picture.</hi> This is certainly the Light in which it is chiefly to be admired, and in which alone the Criticks have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to place it.</p>
                     <p>There is reaſon to believe that <hi>Homer</hi> did in this, as he has done in other Arts, (even in Mechanicks) that is, comprehend whatever was known of it in his Time; if not (as is highly probable) from thence extend his Ideas yet farther, and give a more enlarged Notion of it. Accordingly it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that there is ſcarce a Species or Branch of this Art which is not here to be found, whether Hiſtory, Battel-Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Landskip, Architecture, Fruits, Flowers, Animals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>I think it poſſible that Painting was arrived to a greater Degree of Perfection, even at that early Period, than is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuppoſed by thoſe who have written upon it. <hi>Pliny</hi> expreſly ſays, that it was not known in the time of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> War. The ſame Author, and others, repreſent it in a very imperfect State in <hi>Greece,</hi> in, or near the Days of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> They tell us of one Painter, that he was the firſt who begun to ſhadow; and of another, that he fill'd his Outlines only with a ſingle Colour, and that laid on every where alike: But we may have a higher Notion of the Art, from thoſe Deſcriptions of Statues, Carvings, Tapeſtrys, Sculptures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Armour, and Ornaments of all kinds, which every where occur in our Author; as well as from what he ſays of their Beauty, the Relievo, and their Emulation of Life itſelf. If we conſider how much it is his conſtant Practice to confine himſelf to the Cuſtom of the Times whereof he writ, it will be hard to doubt but that Painting and Sculpture muſt have been then in great Practice and Repute.</p>

The Shield is not only deſcrib'd as a Piece of Sculpture but of Painting; the Outlines may be ſuppos'd engraved, and the reſt enamel'd, or inlaid with various-colour'd Metals. The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Colours is plainly diſtinguiſh'd by <hi>Homer,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the <hi>Blackneſs</hi> of the new-open'd Earth, of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Colours</hi> of the Grapes and Vines; and in other Places. The different Metals that <hi>Vulcan</hi> is feign'd to caſt into the Furnace, were ſufficient to afford all the neceſſary Colours: But if to thoſe which are natural to the Metals, we add alſo thoſe which they are capable of receiving from the Operation of Fire, we ſhall find, that <hi>Vulcan</hi> had as great a Variety of Colours to make uſe of as any modern Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. That Enamelling, or fixing Colours by Fire, was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed very anciently, may be conjectur'd from what <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> reports of one of the Walls of <hi>Babylon,</hi> built by <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis,</hi> that <hi>the Bricks of it were painted before they were burn'd, ſo as to repreſent all ſorts of Animals.</hi> lib. 2. chap. 4. Now it is but natural to infer, that Men had made uſe of ordinary Colours for the Repreſentation of Objects, before they learnt to repreſent them by ſuch as are given by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of Fire; one being much more eaſy and obvious than the other, and that ſort of Painting by means of Fire being but an Imitation of the Painting with a Pencil and Colours. The ſame Inference will be farther enforc'd from the Works of Tapeſtry, which the Women of thoſe Times interweaved with many Colours; as appears from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of that Veil which <hi>Hecuba</hi> offers to <hi>Minerva</hi> in the ſixth Iliad, and from a Paſſage in the twenty ſecond where <hi>Andromache</hi> is repreſented working Flowers in a Piece of this kind. They muſt certainly have known the Uſe of the Colours themſelves for Painting, before they could think of dying Threads with thoſe Colours, and weaving thoſe Threads cloſe to one another, in order only to a more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Imitation of a thing ſo much more eaſily perform'd by a Pencil. This Obſervation I owe to the <hi>Abbè Fraguier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may indeed be thought, that a Genius ſo vaſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive as that of <hi>Homer</hi> might carry his Views beyond the reſt of Mankind, and that in this Buckler of <hi>Achilles</hi> he rather deſign'd to give a Scheme of what might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0356200105:141"/>
than a Deſcription of what really was ſo: And ſince he made a God the Artiſt, he might excuſe himſelf from a ſtrict Confinement to what was known and practiſed in the Time of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War. Let this be as it will, it is certain that he had, whether by Learning, or by Strength of Genius, (tho' the latter be more glorious for <hi>Homer</hi>) a full and exact Idea of Painting in all its Parts; that is to ſay, in the <hi>Invention,</hi> the <hi>Compoſition,</hi> the <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Invention</hi> is ſhewn in finding and introducing, in every Subject, the <hi>greateſt,</hi> the moſt <hi>ſignificant,</hi> and moſt <hi>ſuitable</hi> Objects. Accordingly in every ſingle Picture of the Shield, <hi>Homer</hi> conſtantly finds out either thoſe Objects which are naturally the Principal, thoſe which moſt conduce to ſhew the Subject, or thoſe which ſet it in the livelieſt and moſt agreeable Light: Theſe he never fails to diſpoſe in the moſt advantagious Manners, Situations, and Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Next, we find all his Figures differently <hi>characterized,</hi> in their Expreſſions and Attitudes, according to their ſeveral Natures: The Gods (for inſtance) are diſtinguiſh'd in Air, Habit, and Proportion, from Men, in the fourth Picture; Maſters from Servants, in the eighth; and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Nothing is more wonderful than his exact Obſervation of the <hi>Contraſt,</hi> not only between Figure and Figure, but between Subject and Subject. The City in Peace is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt to the City in War: Between the Siege in the fourth Picture, and the Battel in the ſixth, a piece of Paiſage is introduced, and rural Scenes follow after. The Country too is repreſented in War in the fifth, as well as in Peace in the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth. The very Animals are ſhewn in theſe two different States, in the tenth and the eleventh. Where the Subjects appear the ſame, he contraſtes them ſome other way: Thus the firſt Picture of the Town in Peace having a predominant Air of Gaiety, in the Dances and Pomps of the Marriage; the ſecond has a Character of Earneſtneſs and Sollicitude, in the Diſpute and Pleadings. In the Pieces of rural Life, that of the Plowing is of a different Character from the Harveſt, and that of the Harveſt from the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. In each of theſe there is a Contraſt of the <hi>Labour</hi>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0356200105:142"/>
and <hi>Mirth</hi> of the country People: In the firſt, ſome are plowing, others taking a Cup of good Liquor; in the next, we ſee the Reapers working in one part, and the Banquet prepar'd in another; in the laſt, the Labour of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard is reliev'd with Muſick and a Dance. The Perſons are no leſs varied, Old and Young, Men and Women: There being Women in two Pictures together, namely the eighth and ninth, it is remarkable that thoſe in the latter are of a different Character from the former; they who dreſs the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being ordinary Women, the others who carry Baskets in the Vineyard, young and beautiful Virgins: And theſe again are of an inferior Character to thoſe in the twelfth Piece, who are diſtinguiſh'd as People of Condition by a more elegant Dreſs. There are three Dances in the Buckler; and theſe too are varied: That at the Wedding is in a circular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, that of the Vineyard in a Row, that in the laſt Picture, a mingled one. Laſtly, there is a manifeſt Contraſt in the Colours; nay, ev'n in the Back-Grounds of the ſeveral Pieces: For Example, that of the Plowing is of a dark Tinct, that of the Harveſt yellow, that of the Paſture green, and the reſt in like manner.</p>
                     <p>That he was not a Stranger to Aerial <hi>Perſpective,</hi> appears in his expreſly marking the Diſtance of Object from Object: He tells us, for inſtance, that the two Spies lay a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the other Figures; and that the Oak under which was ſpread the Banquet of the Reapers, ſtood apart. What he ſays of the Valley ſprinkled all over with Cottages and Flocks, appears to be a Deſcription of a large Country in Perſpective. And indeed a general Argument for this may be drawn from the Number of Figures on the Shield; which could not be all expreſs'd in their full Magnitude: And this is therefore a ſort of Proof that the Art of leſſening them according to Perſpective was known at that Time.</p>
                     <p>What the Criticks call the <hi>three Unities,</hi> ought in reaſon as much to be obſerved in a Picture as in a Play; each ſhould have only <hi>one principal Action,</hi> one <hi>Inſtant of Time,</hi> and one <hi>Point of View.</hi> In this Method of Examination alſo, the Shield of <hi>Homer</hi> will bear the Teſt: He has been more exact than the greateſt Painters, who have often deviated from one or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0356200105:143"/>
other of theſe Rules; whereas (when we examine the detail of each Compartiment) it will appear,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that there is but one principal Action in each Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and that no ſupernumerary Figures or Actions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. This will anſwer all that has been ſaid of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Crowd of Figures on the Shield, by thoſe who never comprehended the Plan of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that no Action is repreſented in one Peice, which could not happen in the ſame Inſtant of Time. This will overthrow the Objection againſt ſo many different Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appearing in one Shield; which, in this Caſe, is much as abſurd as to object againſt ſo many of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Cartons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in one Gallery.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It will be manifeſt that there are no Objects in any one Picture which could not be ſeen in one Point of View. Hereby the <hi>Abbè Teraſſon</hi>'s whole Criticiſm will fall to the Ground, which amounts but to this, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Objects of the Heavens, Stars and Sea, with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Proſpects of Towns, Fields, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could never be ſeen all at once. <hi>Homer</hi> was incapable of ſo abſurd a Thought, nor could theſe heavenly Bodies (had he intended them for a Picture) have ever been ſeen together from one Point; for the Conſtellations and the Full Moon, for example, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſeen at once with the Sun. But the celeſtial Bodies were placed on the Boſs, as the Ocean at the Margin of the Shield: Theſe were no Parts of the Painting, but the former was only an Ornament to the Projection in the middle, and the latter a Frame round about it: In the ſame manner as the Diviſions, Projections, or Angles of a Roof are left to be ornamented at the Diſcretion of the Painter, with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liage, Architecture, Groteſque, or what he pleaſes: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Judgment will be ſtill more commendable, if he contrives to make even theſe extrinſical Parts, to bear ſome Alluſion to the main Deſign: It is this which <hi>Homer</hi> has done, in placing a ſort of Sphere in the middle, and the Ocean at the Border, of a Work, which was expreſſly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repreſent the Univerſe.</p>

Deceas'd to watch his Corps, and prevent any Corruption before the ſolemn Day of his Funerals. It is plain this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir was thought an indiſpenſable one, ſince <hi>Achilles</hi> could not diſcharge himſelf of it but by impoſing it upon his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is alſo clear, that in thoſe times the Preſervation of a dead Body was accounted a very important Matter, ſince the Goddeſſes themſelves, nay the moſt delicate of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, made it the Subject of their utmoſt Attention. As <hi>Thetis</hi> preſerves the Body of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and chaſes from it thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects that breed in the Wounds and cauſe Putrefaction, ſo <hi>Venus</hi> is employ'd Day and Night about that of <hi>Hector,</hi> in driving away the Dogs to which <hi>Achilles</hi> had expos'd it. <hi>Apollo,</hi> on his part, covers it with a thick Cloud, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves its Freſhneſs amidſt the greateſt Heats of the Sun: And this Care of the Deities over the Dead was look'd upon by Men as a Fruit of their Piety.</p>
                  <p>There is an excellent Remark upon this Paſſage in <hi>Boſſu</hi>'s admirable Treatiſe of the Epic Poem, lib. 3. c. 10. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"To ſpeak (ſays this Author) of the Arts and Sciences as a Poet ought, we ſhould veil them under Names and Actions of Perſons fictitious and allegorical. <hi>Homer</hi> will not plainly ſay that Salt has the Virtue to preſerve dead Bodies, and prevent the Flies from engendering Worms in them; he will not ſay, that the Sea preſented <hi>Achilles</hi> a Remedy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Patroclus</hi> from Putrefaction; but he will make the Sea a Goddeſs, and tell us, that <hi>Thetis</hi> to comfort <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> engaged to perfume the Body with an Ambroſia which ſhou'd keep it a whole Year from Corruption: It is thus <hi>Homer</hi> teaches the Poets to ſpeak of Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

                  <p>The Diſcourſe of the ſame Critick upon theſe ſort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions in general, deſerves to be tranſcribed. That uſeleſs Nicety (ſays he) of avoiding every Repetition which the Delicacy of later Times has introduced, was not known to the firſt Ages of Antiquity: The Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> abound with them. Far from condemning their frequent Uſe in the moſt ancient of all the Poets, we ſhould look upon them as the certain Character of the Age in which he liv'd: They ſpoke ſo in his Time, and to have ſpoken otherwiſe had been a Fault. And indeed nothing is in itſelf ſo contrary to the true Sublime, as that painful and frivolous Exactneſs, with which we avoid to make uſe of a proper Word becauſe it was us'd before. It is certain that the <hi>Romans</hi> were leſs ſcrupulous as to this point: You have often in a ſingle Page of <hi>Tully,</hi> the ſame Word five or ſix times over. If it were really a Fault, it is not to be conceiv'd how an Author who ſo little wanted Variety of Expreſſions as <hi>Homer,</hi> could be ſo very negligent herein? On the contrary, he ſeems to have affected to repeat the ſame Things in the ſame Words, on many Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0356200105:183"/>
It was from two Principles equally true, that among ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral People, and in ſeveral Ages, two Practices entirely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent took their Riſe. <hi>Moſes, Homer,</hi> and the Writers of the firſt Times, had found that Repetitions of the ſame Words recall'd the Ideas of Things, imprinted them much more ſtrongly, and render'd the Diſcourſe more intelligible. Upon this Principle, the Cuſtom of repeating Words, Phraſes, and even entire Speeches, inſenſibly eſtabliſh'd itſelf both in Proſe and in Poetry, eſpecially in Narrations.</p>
                  <p>The Writers who ſucceeded them obſerv'd, even from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> himſelf, that the greateſt Beauty of Style conſiſted in Variety. This they made their Principle: They therefore avoided Repetitions of Words, and ſtill more of whole Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; they endeavour'd to vary their Tranſitions; and found out new Turns and Manners of expreſſing the ſame Things.</p>
                  <p>Either of theſe Practices is good, but the Exceſs of either vicious: We ſhould neither on the one hand, thro' a Love of Simplicity and Clearneſs, continually repeat the ſame Words, Phraſes, or Diſcourſes; nor on the other, for the Pleaſure of Variety, fall into a childiſh Affectation of expreſſing every thing twenty different Ways, tho' it be never ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and common.</p>
                  <p>Nothing ſo much cools the Warmth of a Piece or puts out the Fire of Poetry, as that perpetual Care to vary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly even in the ſmalleſt Circumſtances. In this, as in many other Points, <hi>Homer</hi> has deſpis'd the ungrateful Labour of too ſcrupulous a Nicety. He has done like a great Painter, who does not think himſelf oblig'd to vary all his Pieces to that degree, as not one of 'em ſhall have the leaſt Reſemblance to another: If the principal Figures are entirely different, we eaſily excuſe a Reſemblance in the Landſcapes, the Skies, or the Draperies. Suppoſe a Gallery full of Pictures, each of which repreſents a particular Subject: In one I ſee <hi>Achilles</hi> in Fury, menacing <hi>Agamemnon;</hi> in another the ſame Hero with regret delivers up <hi>Briſeis</hi> to the Heralds; in a third 'tis ſtill <hi>Achilles,</hi> but <hi>Achilles</hi> overcome with Grief, and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Mother. If the Air, the Geſture, the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the Character of <hi>Achilles,</hi> are the ſame in each of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0356200105:184"/>
theſe three Pieces; if the Ground of one of theſe be the ſame with that of the others in the Compoſition and general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, whether it be Landſcape, or Architecture; then indeed one ſhould have reaſon to blame the Painter for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of his Figures and Grounds. But if there be no Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but in the Folds of a few Draperies, in the Structure of ſome part of a Building, or in the Figure of ſome Tree, Mountain, or Cloud, it is what no one would regard as a Fault. The Application is obvious: <hi>Homer</hi> repeats, but they are not the great Strokes which he repeats, not thoſe which ſtrike and fix our Attention: They are only the little Parts, the Tranſitions, the general Circumſtances, or familiar Images, which recur naturally, and upon which the Reader but caſts his Eye careleſly: Such as the Deſcriptions of Sacrifices, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſts, or Embarquements; ſuch in ſhort, as are in their own Nature much the ſame, which it is ſufficient juſt to ſhew, and which are in a manner incapable of different Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

Thoſe who condemned <hi>Homer,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jupiter</hi> was for the <hi>Trojans;</hi> he ſaw the <hi>Greeks</hi> were the ſtrongeſt, ſo permitted the Gods to declare themſelves and go to the Battel.

that the <hi>Trojans</hi> ſhou'd be ſtronger than the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he has only a mind that the Decree of Deſtiny ſhould be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.

The Reader (ſays he) would naturally expect ſome great and terrible Atchievements ſhould enſue from <hi>Achilles</hi> upon his firſt entrance upon Action. The Poet ſeems to prepare us for it, by his magnificent Introduction of him into the Field: But inſtead of a Storm, we have a Calm; he follows the ſame Method in this Book as he did in the third, where when both Armies were ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a general Conflict, he ends the Day in a ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between two Heroes: Thus he always agreeably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes his Readers. Beſides the Admirers of <hi>Homer</hi> reap a farther Advantage from this Converſation of the Heroes: There is a Chain of ancient Hiſtory as well as a Series of poetical Beauties.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Dacier</hi>'s Excuſe is very little better: And to ſhew that this is really a Fault in the Poet, I believe I may appeal to the Taſte of every Reader who certainly finds himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed: Our Expectation is rais'd to ſee Gods and Heroes engage, when ſuddenly it all ſinks into ſuch a Combat in which neither Party receive a Wound; and (what is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary) the Gods are made the Spectators of ſo ſmall an Action!

Neither is it any Excuſe to ſay he has given us a peice of ancient Hiſtory; We expected to read a Poet, not an Hiſtorian.

his Subject: The opening of the Poem profeſſes to treat of the Anger of <hi>Achilles;</hi> that Anger draws on all the great Events of the Story: And <hi>Homer</hi> at every Opportunity awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the Reader to an Attention to it, by mentioning the Effects of it: So that when we ſee in this place the Hero deaf to Youth, and Compaſſion, it is what we expect: Mercy in him would offend, becauſe it is contrary to his Character. <hi>Homer</hi> propoſes him not as a Pattern for Imitation; but the Moral of the Poem which he deſign'd the Reader ſhould draw from it, is, that we ſhould avoid Anger, ſince it is ever pernicious in the Event.</p>

                  <p>THIS Book is entirely different from all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going: Tho' it be a Battel, it is entirely of a new and ſurprizing kind, diverſify'd with a vaſt Variety of Imagery and Deſcription. The Scene is totally chang'd, he paints the Combate of his Hero with the Rivers, and deſcribes a Battel amidſt an Inundation. It is obſervable that tho' the whole War of the Iliad was upon the Banks of theſe Rivers, <hi>Homer</hi> has artfully left out the Machinery of River-Gods in all the other Battels, to aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize this of his Hero. There is no Book of the Poem that has more force of Imagination, or in which the great and inexhauſted Invention of our Author is more powerfully exerted. After this Deſcription of an Inundation, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a very beautiful Contraſt in that of the Drought: The Part of <hi>Achilles</hi> is admirably ſuſtain'd, and the new Strokes which <hi>Homer</hi> gives to his Picture are ſuch as are deriv'd from the very ſource of his Character, and finiſh the entire Draught of this Hero.</p>

From this Obſervation the Poet draws his Alluſion which is very much to the Honour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſince it repreſents the <hi>Trojans</hi> with reſpect to him as no more than ſo many Inſects.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Commentator takes notice, that becauſe the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> in particular was us'd to practiſe this Method with the Locuſts, ſome Authors have conjectur'd that <hi>Homer</hi> was of that Country; but if this were a ſufficient Reaſon for ſuch a Suppoſition, he might be ſaid to be born in almoſt all the Countries of the World, ſince he draws his Obſervations from the Cuſtoms of them all.</p>
                  <p>We may hence account for the innumerable Armies of theſe Locuſts, mention'd among the Plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> without having recourſe to an immediate Creation, as ſome good Men have imagin'd, whereas the Miracle indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the wonderful manner of bringing them upon the <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians:</hi> I have often obſerv'd with Pleaſure the Similitude which many of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Expreſſions bear with the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and that the oldeſt Writer in the World except <hi>Moſes</hi>

The Poem now draws to a Concluſion, the <hi>Trojans</hi> are to be puniſh'd for their Perjury and Violence: <hi>Homer</hi> accordingly with a poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Juſtice ſums up the Evidence againſt them, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the very Founder of <hi>Troy</hi> as an injurious perſon. There have been ſeveral References to this Story ſince the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Poem, but he forbore to give it at large till near the end of it; that it might be freſh upon the Memory, and ſhew, the <hi>Trojans</hi> deſerve the Puniſhment they are about to ſuffer.</p>

                     <hi>Euſtathius</hi> gives the reaſon why <hi>Apollo</hi> aſſiſts the <hi>Trojans,</hi> tho' he had been equally with <hi>Neptune</hi> affronted by <hi>Laome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> This proceeded from the Honours which <hi>Apollo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the Poſterity of <hi>Laomedon; Troy</hi> paid him no leſs Worſhip than <hi>Cilla,</hi> or <hi>Tenedos;</hi> and by theſe means won him over to a Forgiveneſs: But <hi>Neptune</hi> ſtill was ſlighted, and conſequently continued an Enemy to the whole Race.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0356200105:290"/>
The ſame Author gives us various Opinions why <hi>Neptune</hi> is ſaid to have built the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wall, and to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of his Wages: Some ſay that <hi>Laomedon</hi> ſacrilegiouſly took away the Treaſures out of the Temples of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> to carry on the Fortifications: From whence it was fabled that <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> built the Walls. Others will have it, that two of the Workmen dedicated their Wages to <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Neptune;</hi> and that <hi>Laomedon</hi> detained them: So that he might in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to defraud the Deities themſelves, by with-holding what was dedicated to their Temples.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why <hi>Apollo</hi> is ſaid to have kept the Herds of <hi>Laomedon</hi> is not ſo clear: <hi>Euſtathius</hi> obſerves that all Plagues firſt ſeize upon the four-footed Creation, and are ſuppos'd to ariſe from this Deity: Thus <hi>Apollo</hi> in the firſt Book ſends the Plague into the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army: The Ancients therefore made him to preſide over Cattel, that by preſerving them from the Plague, Mankind might be ſafe from infectious Diſeaſes. Others tell us, that this Employment is aſcrib'd to <hi>Apollo,</hi> becauſe he ſignifies the Sun: Now the Sun cloaths the Paſtures with Graſs and Herbs: So that <hi>Apollo</hi> may be ſaid himſelf to feed the Cattel, by ſupplying them with Food. Upon either of theſe accounts <hi>Laomedon</hi> may be ſaid to be ungrateful to that Deity, for raiſing no Temple to his Honour.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable that <hi>Homer</hi> in this Story aſcribes the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wall to <hi>Neptune</hi> only: I ſhould conjecture the reaſon might be, that <hi>Troy</hi> being a Sea-port Town, the chief Strength of it depended upon its Situation, ſo that the Sea was in a manner a Wall to it: Upon this account <hi>Neptune</hi> may not improbably be ſaid to have built the Wall.</p>
