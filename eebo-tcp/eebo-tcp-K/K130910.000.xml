         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>DIRECTIONS FOR ROASTING.</head>
               <p>In the firſt place, you muſt regulate your fire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Piece of meat you are to dreſs:—
If it be a ſmall or thin piece, make a pretty
little briſk fire; but if it be a large joint, let a
very good fire be laid to cake. Take care to
keep your fire always clear, and let your ſpit be
very clean. When the ſteam draws near the
fire, it is a ſign that the meat is done enough;
but you will beſt judge of that from the time it
was put down. Obſerve, that in froſty weather
all kinds of meat take more time in dreſſing.</p>
               <div type="recipe">
                  <head>To roaſt Veniſon.</head>
                  <p>TAKE a haunch of veniſon, and when you have
ſpitted it, lay over it a large ſheet of white
paper, then a thin paſte with another ſheet of paper
over it, and tie it well to prevent the paſte from falling.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1036000400:4"/>
About five or ſix minutes before you take it up,
take off the paper and paſte, baſte it with butter,
and dredge it with a little flour: when you diſh it
up, let it be accompanied with ſome good gravy in
one ſauceboat, and ſweet ſauce in another. If it
be a large haunch, it will take three hours roaſting.
The neck and ſhoulder may be dreſſed the ſame
way. The ſauce for veniſon may be either cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
jelly warmed, or half a pint of red wine, with
a quarter of a pound of ſugar, ſimmered over a clear
fire for ſeven or eight minutes; or about half a pint
of vinegar, with a proportionate quantity of ſugar,
ſimmered till it becomes of the conſiſtence of a
ſyrup.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="recipe">
                  <head>To roaſt Mutton.</head>
                  <p>If it be a Chine or faddle of mutton, you muſt
raiſe the ſkin, and then ſkewer it on again; for that
will prevent its being ſcorched. Strip off the ſkin
about a quarter of an hour before you take it up;
throw ſome flour on your meat, together with a
handful of ſalt, and baſte it with butter. Roaſt mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
when ſerved up, may be accompanied with
French beans, broccoli, potatoes, cauliflower, horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſh,
or water creſſes.—N. B. Onion ſauce is
frequently uſed with a ſhoulder of mutton, either
roaſted or boiled.</p>

               <div type="recipe">
                  <head>To roaſt Mutton ſo as to make it eat like Veniſon.</head>
                  <p>Having procured a fat hind-quarter of mutton,
cut the leg in the ſhape of a haunch of veniſon, lay
it in a pan, and pour over it a bottle of red wine, in
which it muſt lie twenty-four hours; then put it on
the ſpit, and baſte it with the ſame liquor and butter
all the time it is roaſting. If you have a good
quick fire, your meat will be done in two hours.
You may ſend it to table with ſome good gravy in
one baſon, and current jelly in another.</p>

                  <head>To roaſt a Pig.</head>
                  <p>Put into the belly of your pig a few ſage leaves
chopped, a piece of butter, a cruſt of bread grated,
and ſome pepper and ſalt; ſew it up, ſpit it, and lay
it down to a large briſk fire. Flour it all over very
thick, and continue to do ſo till the eyes begin to
ſtart. As ſoon as you find the ſkin tight and criſp,
and that the eyes are dropped, ſet two baſons in
the dripping-pan, to receive the gravy that comes
from it. When the pig is done enough, put a lump
of butter into a cloth, and rub all over it, till the
flour is quite off; then take it up into your diſh, and
having cut off the head, cut the pig in two down
the back; chop off the ears, and place one upon
each ſhoulder; cut the under jaw in two, and lay on
each ſide; melt ſome butter, put it into the gravy
that came from your pig, boil it up and put it into
the diſh with the brains bruiſed fine, and a little
ſhred ſage; then ſend the whole to table, with bread
ſauce in a baſon, and garniſh with lemon.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="recipe">
                  <head>A Pig barbecued.</head>
                  <p>Take two or three anchovies, a few leaves of
ſage, and the liver of the pig; chop them very
ſmall, and put them into a marble mortar, with half
a pint of red wine, ſome butter, bread-crumbs, and
pepper: beat them all together to a paſte, and ſew
them up in your pig's belly; then lay it down to
the fire, ſinge it well, pour in the dripping pan
two or three bottles of red wine, and baſte it with
the wine all the time it is roaſting. When it is
almoſt done, take the ſauce out of your dripping-pan,
add to it one anchovy, half a lemon, and a
bunch of ſweet herbs, boil theſe a few minutes,
then take up your pig, put a ſmall lemon, or apple
in its mouth, ſtrain your ſauce, and pour it on
boiling hot; lay barberries and ſliced lemon round
the pig, and ſerve it up whole.</p>

ſmall ſkewers to the top of your beef; then lay it
down to a good fire, throw ſome ſalt on it, and baſte
it well with good dripping. A little while before
you take it up, remove the paper, dredge the meat
with ſome flour, and baſte it with a piece of butter.
Garniſh the diſh with ſcraped horſe-radiſh, and ſend
it to table with broccoli, French beans, potatoes,
horſe-radiſh, or cauliflower. When you want to
keep your meat a few days before you dreſs it, you
muſt dry it well with a clean cloth, then flour it all
over, and hang it up in a place where the air may

meat at ſome diſtance from the fire till it is ſoaked,
and then draw it nearer the fire; baſte it well with
butter, and duſt it with a little flour. The ſtuffing
for a fillet is made thus: take half a pound of ſuet,
about a pound of grated bread, ſome parſley, thyme,
ſweet marjoram, and ſavory, a piece of lemon-peel,
nutmeg, pepper, and ſalt, and mix them up together

is frequently ſtuffed with ſage and onion chopped

leg is as follows: firſt parboil it, then ſkin it and

the ſkin, and what fat you can; put it into a

four gallons of ſoft water, with ſix anchovies, half
an ounce of mace, a few cloves, half an ounce of
whole white pepper, three onions cut in two, a

with the bottom cruſt of a two-penny loat that is
well baked; cover it very cloſe, and let it have
a conſtant fire to do leiſurely for ſeven or eight
hours; then ſtir it well together, to make the meat
ſeparate; cover it cloſe-again, and in an hour try
your broth in a cup, to ſee if it will glutinate; if
it does, take if off, and ſtrain it through a canvas
bag into a clean pan; then have china or well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glazed
earthen cups, and fill them with the clear
jelly; put them into a broad gravy-pan, or ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,
with boiling water; ſet in the cups, and let
them boil in that till they are perfectly glue.—
When they are almoſt cold, run a knife round them,
and turn them upon a piece or new flannel, to draw
out the moiſture; in ſix or ſeven hours turn them,
and do ſo till they are perfectly hard and dry; put
them into ſtone jars, and keep them in a dry place.</p>
                  <p>This is very good for ſoups, ſauces, and gravies.

                  <p>Take a leg of veal, bone it, and take off all

chickens feet, waſhed clean and chopped to pieces;
put al into a large ſtoving-pot, with three gallons
of ſoft water and let it ſtove gently till the meat
is ſo tender as to ſeparate. You muſt keep your
pot tight covered, and a conſtant fire during the
time of its ſtoving; in about ſeven or eight hours
try your jelly in a cup, and when quite cold, if it
is ſo ſtiff that you can cut it with a knife, take
it off, and ſtrain it through a ſieve; but take off
all the fat and ſcum firſt with a ſpoon, and then
with filtering paper; provide china cups, and fill
them with the clear jelly; ſet them in a gravy-pan,
or a large ſtewpan of boiling water, over a ſtove;
in this water boil your jelly in the cups till it is as
thick as glue; after which, let them ſtand in the
water till they are quite cold: Before you turn
them out of your cups, run the edge of a knife
round to looſen them, then turn them upon a piece
of new flannel, which will draw out all the moiſture
gradually. Turn them every ſix or eight hours,
till they are perfectly dry, and like a piece of
glue; keep them in as dry a place as you can, and
in a little time they will be ſo hard, that you may
carry them in your pocket without the leaſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.
When you want to uſe it, take a piece

boiling water on it, ſtirring it till it is diſſolved;
ſeaſon it with ſalt to your taſte, and you will have
a baſon of ſtrong broth. If you want a diſh of
ſoup, boil vermicelli in water; then to a cake of
your ſoup pour a pint of water, ſo that four cakes
will make two quarts; when it is thoroughly

                  <head>How to chuſe Beef.</head>
                  <p>IF the beef be young, it will be ſmooth and
tender; if old, it generally appears rough and
ſpongy. When it is of a carnation colour, it is a
ſign of its being good ſpending meat.</p>

               <div type="instruction">
                  <head>To chuſe Mutton.</head>
                  <p>When mutton is old, the fleſh, when pinched,
will wrinkle, and continue ſo; if it be young, the
fleſh will pinch tender, and the fat will eaſily
part from the lean; whereas, when the meat is
old, the fat will ſtick by ſtrings and ſkins. The
fleſh of ewe mutton is in general paler than that
of wether mutton; it is of a cloſer grain, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1036000400:98"/>
parts more eaſily. When the fleſh of mutton is looſe
at the bone, and of a pale yellowiſh colour, it is an
indication of its being ſomewhat rotten.</p>

                  <p>If a hind-quarter of lamb has a ſaint ſmell under
the kidney, and the knuckle be limber, it is ſtale
meat. If the neck vein of a fore quarter be of an
azure colour, it is new and good meat; but if
greeniſh, or yellowiſh, the meat is nearly tainted.</p>

                  <head>To chuſe Pork.</head>
                  <p>If the pork be old, the lean will be tough, and
the fat ſpongy and flabby; if young, the lean,
when pinched, will break between your fingers,
and when you nip the ſkin with your nails, it will
make a dent. The ſkin of pork is in general
clammy and ſweaty when the meat is ſtale, but
ſmooth and cool when new. When many little
kernels, like hail-ſhot, are found in the fat of pork,
it is then meaſly.</p>

then take clear water, let it not be too hot, for that
makes them yellow, and ſtrain the water through a
cloth; then take the beſt ſoap, a ſmall quantity (as
your waſh is) put it upon a clean ſtick, beat up
your lather, let it not be with a whiſk, becauſe it
will make the water yellow, and leaves ſplinters in
the water, which will tear the muſlins.</p>
                  <p>After the lather is beat, put in your fouleſt

prevent tearing, whilſt the water is warm; then
ſqueeze them between both hands, for fear of
leaving the dirty ſuds in them: As you waſh them
out, ſhake them open into a diſh; then let your
ſecond lather be beat up as your firſt, only let the
water be hotter, but not ſcalding hot; waſh them
whilſt they are warm, and ſqueeze them as before;
then, as to your third lather, let your water be
ſcalding hot, but not boiling, for that makes the
water yellow; then take a ſmall quantity of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-blue,
put it in a cup, and put water to it, a
little more than will wet it, then ſhake the cup
about, afterwards pour it into the ſcalding water,
and ſtir it about till it is blue enough; then take
ſoap and beat up your lather as before, and put
the yelloweſt muſlins in firſt, then let them be
covered over with a clean cloth: You may waſh
them out whilſt warm, or let them ſtand all night
to clear them.</p>
                  <p>When you waſh them out, take care and waſh
the blue out, then lay them in clear pump-water;
if you have not time to ſtarch them all at once, put
no more in your ſtarch than you can finiſh in one
day, for lying in the ſtarch makes them look yellow
and ſtreaky. Let them be in water till you have
time to finiſh them; but do not excued two
days.</p>
                  <p>Moſt ſtarchers boil their muſlins, but they
ſhould not, becauſe it wears them out; but
the ſcalding and letting muſlins lie in the ſuds
do them more good than a boil: Likewiſe
obſerve never to ſoap your muſlins, for waſhing
out the ſoap will cauſe you to fray the muſlins.</p>

pour a little of it in the rinſing-water, and ſtir it
about; put your whiteſt muſlins in firſt, one by
one, and in caſe any blue ſhould ſettle, rub them
with your hand lightly in the water, and it will
come off; and if any of your muſlins be yellow,
you muſt make the rinſing-water a little bluer:
After you have rinſed them, ſqueeze them one by
one, very hard, becauſe they will not take the
ſtarch if any water is left in them, and pull them
out with dry hands, double them upon a clean
dry cloth, in order to ſtarch them. Some people
ſtarch them dry; but they ought not, for it makes
them yellow and ſtiff, and is very apt to fray
them.</p>

               <div type="instruction">
                  <head>To make Starch for the Muſlins.</head>
                  <p>Take a pint of pump water to a quarter of a
pound of ſtarch, put the water in a ſkillet, and put
it over a clear fire till it is luke-warm, then put in
your ſtarch, keep it ſtirring ſlowly one way till it
boils, one boil and no more, then pour it into a
pan, cover it with a plate till it is cold; when it is
cold, take ſome upon your hand, and ſome blue
in the other hand, then mix them together, but
make it not too blue, for the leſs blue the better:
You need not make any more at a time, keep it not
above a week, for that will make your muſlins look
yellow: Take your muſlins doubled as before, one
by one, then ſpread the ſtarch with your hand,
but not too thick, firſt on one ſide, and then on the
other, but not open it; then blue the fineſt muſlins
firſt, and then the thicker, for the ſtarch that
comes out of the fineſt will ſtarch the thick ones;
and the ſame ſtarch that comes out of the muſlins
will ſtarch aprons, caps and handkerchiefs, for
thin ſtarch is beſt for them, becauſe they muſt not
be too ſtiff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:1036000400:112"/>
When you have ſtarched the muſlins, lay them
in an earthen diſh, kneading them with your dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fiſt till the ſtarch ſticks about your hands, then
ſqueezing them hard, wipe them with a dry cloth,
after that open them, and rub them ſlightly through
your hands.</p>
                  <p>When you have opened them, and rubbed
them, take the two ends and ſo clap them between
your hands, pull them out very well, to you and
from you, to prevent the fraying. Be ſure your
hands are dry.</p>
                  <p>If any of the ſtarch remains on your hands, it
will fray the muſlin; dry them well, and as you
pull them out, hold them againſt the light to ſee if
they are clapped enough.</p>
                  <p>If any thing looks ſhining, that is the ſtarch,
you muſt rub it over gently; when they are clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
enough, you will obſerve them to fly aſunder,
and not ſtick to your hands; but obſerve to clap
very thick, and very hard, for if you let them dry
they will be limber, ſo that when you ſee no
ſhining, they are clapped enough. You muſt never
clap them ſingle, for that frays and tears them;
neither clap by the fire, except in froſty weather,
for that ſpoils the colour.</p>
                  <p>For the ironing of muſlins, pull them out dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
on the board, as ſmooth and even as you can,
and ſo on till you finiſh about ſix one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
then, with your box-iron, iron the under
two firſt, becauſe that is the drieſt, and ſhould be
pretty dry, but not quite dry, that you may iron
them even, and prevent fraying. Let fine plain
muſlin be ironed upon a ſoft woollen cloth; but
if you have any that is coarſe or thick, you muſt
firſt iron them upon a damp cloth, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon your ironing-cloth, the wrong
ſide.</p>
                  <p>As for lawns, in the waſhing and rinſing, do
them as you do muſlins; make a very thin ſtarch,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1036000400:113"/>
but not water ſtarch; dip them in, and ſqueeze
them out hard, wipe them with a dry cloth very
hard, and clap them carefully, for they are very
apt to ſlip; then fold them up, and put them into
a dry pan when they are clapped enough: If
you touch them with any wet, it will leave a ſort
of thick look, and ſo will muſlins. You may iron
them on a damp cloth like the muſlins, but not with
too hot an iron; and alſo iron them on the wrong
ſide, as you do the thick muſlins.</p>
                  <p>You muſt not ſtarch with ſtarch left from other
things, therefore make freſh as before, and ſee
that the ſame be a little matter bluer than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>As for night-caps, aprons, &amp;c. you muſt ſtarch
them in very thin ſtarch, which comes from the
muſlins; but it muſt be thicker than water ſtarch,
a ſmall matter of clapping ſerves them; but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that they are clear; you muſt alſo pull them
out towards the gathers, to prevent the fraying
them. Every way double them, and lay them on
the board as even as you can, and let them lie till
they are pretty near dry; then put them even, and
iron them on the wrong ſides.</p>
                  <p>To do lace the beſt way, you muſt ſew tape to
each ſide of the lace, then waſh it amongſt other
muſlins, or by itſelf, in three lathers, and if it
looks not white, put it into warm butter-milk,
and let it lie a day, then hang it to dry, and then
waſh it out in two or three lathers, but the lathers
muſt be blue, after which take it out, and pin it
upon your board by the tapes very even; then
take muſlins the length of the lace, and dip it in
water ſtarch, and ſo lay it upon the lace till it
dries; obſerve not to ſqueeze any of the ſtarch out
of the muſlin.</p>
                  <p>When the lace is dry, take off the tapes;
after which pick the purls and the foot very
tenderly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:1036000400:114"/>
If you open the purls, you muſt make a round
hardiſh pillow, and lay paper on it, which will
ſhew the purls the plainer; afterwards lay the
lace upon the paper, and, with a long ſlender nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
with a bit of wax at the head, you may eaſily
open them, if they are well picked out at firſt;
after you have opened them, lay them upon a
board, with a muſlin over them, and iron them with
an iron not too hot.</p>

               <head>Of Brewing Strong OCTOBER BEER.</head>
               <p>CARE, in the firſt place, muſt be taken that
the malt be very clean, and when it is ground,
it ſhould ſtand four and twenty hours at leaſt in the
ſacks.</p>
               <p>The quantity is five quarters of malt to three
hogſheads of beer, and eighteen pounds of hops,
unleſs the malt be pale dried, then there muſt be
added three or four pounds more.</p>
               <p>The choice of liquor for brewing is of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
advantage, the ſofteſt and cleaneſt water is the
beſt.</p>
               <p>You are to boil your firſt liquor, adding a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or two of hops to it, then, before your ſtrike it
over to your malt, cool it in as much liquor as will
bring it to a temper, not to ſcald the malt; for it
is a fault not to take the liquor as high as poſſible,
but not to ſcald.</p>
               <p>The next liquors do the ſame.</p>
               <p>And, indeed, all your liquors ought to be taken
as high may be, that is, not to ſcald.</p>
               <p>When you let your wort from your malt into the
under-back, put to it a handful or two of hops, it
will preſerve it from that accident which brewers
call, Blinking or Foxing.</p>
               <p>In boiling your worts, the firſt wort boil high
or quick; for the quicker the wort is boiled the
better it is.</p>
               <p>The ſecond boil more than the firſt, and the third
or laſt more than the ſecond.</p>
               <p>In cooling, lay your worts thin, and let each be
well cooled, and care muſt be taken in letting them
down into the tun, that you do it leiſurely, to the
end, that as little of the foeces, or ſediment, as
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1036000400:135"/>
poſſible, may paſs with it, which cauſes the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
to be fierce or mild, for,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> There is in all fermented liquors ſalt and
ſulphur, and to keep theſe two bodies in a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
that the ſalt does not exalt itſelf above
the ſulphur, conſiſts a great Part of the art in
brewing.</p>
               <p>When your wort is firſt let into your tun, put
but a little yeaſt to it, and let it work by degrees
quietly, and if you find it works but moderate,
whip in the yeaſt two or three times or more,
till you find your drink well fermented, for without
a full opening of the body by fermentation, it
will not be perfectly fine, nor will it drink clean
or light.</p>
               <p>When you cleanſe, do it by a cock from your
tun, placed ſix inches from the bottom, to the
end that moſt of the ſediment may be left behind,
which may be thrown on your malt to mend your
ſmall-beer.</p>
               <p>When your drink is tunned, fill your veſſel full;
let it work at the bung hole, and have a reſerve in
a ſmall caſk to fill it up, and do not put any of the
drink, which will be under the yeaſt after it is
worked over, into your veſſels; but put it by itſelf
into another caſk, for it will not be ſo good as your
other in the caſk.</p>
               <p>This done, you muſt wait for the finiſhing the
fermentation; then ſtop it cloſe, and let it ſtand
till the Spring, for brewing ought to be done in
the month of October, that it may have time to
ſettle and digeſt all the winter ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>In the Spring you muſt unſtop your vent-hole,
and thereby ſee whether your drink doth ferment
or not; for as ſoon as the warm weather comes,
your drink will have another fermentation, which,
when it is over, let it be again well ſtopped, and
ſtand till September, or longer, and then peg it if
you find it pretty fine, the hop well rotted, and of
a good taſte for drinking.</p>

gallons of liquor, becauſe, one-third part of the

will waſte in boiling. For the ſecond wort, put

you may make a third wort, putting in liquor, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

it off at the bottom, and pour it in at the top till it

               <head>SOME
GENERAL RULES
TO BE OBSERVED IN
COOKERY.</head>
               <p>BEFORE we conclude this Work, we think
it may not be improper to give our readers
ſome General Rules in Cookery.<list>
                     <item n="1">I. In all ſoups you muſt obſerve not to put in
your thickening, 'till your herbs are very tender.</item>
                     <item n="2">II. When you boil any greens, firſt ſoak them
near two hours in water and ſalt, or elſe boil them
in water and ſalt in a copper by themſelves, with
a great quantity of water: Boil no meat with them
for that diſcolours them.</item>
                     <item n="3">III. Uſe no iron pans, &amp;c. for they are not proper;
but let them be copper, braſs, or ſilver.</item>
                     <item n="4">IV. When you fry any Fiſh, firſt dip them in
yolks of eggs, and fry them rather in a ſtew-pan
over the fire, and that will make them of a light
gold colour.</item>
                     <item n="5">
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:1036000400:160"/>
V. White ſauces being now more generally uſed
than brown; theſe are chiefly to be made ſo with
cream, and adding a little Champaign or French
white wine, and butter rolled up in flour.</item>
                     <item n="6">VI. Parboil all your meats that you uſe for fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſees,
or elſe ſtewing them too long on the fire will
make them hard.</item>
                     <item n="7">VII. In roaſting or boiling, a quarter of an hour
to every pound of meat, at a ſteady fire, is the beſt
rule that can be given to do it to perfection.</item>
                     <item n="8">VIII. When you beat almonds, always put in
orange flower-water, or roſe-water, to prevent their
turning to oil, which they are ſubject to.</item>
                     <item n="9">IX. When you dreſs mutton, pigeons, &amp;c. in
blood, always wring in ſome lemon-juice, to keep
it from changing.</item>
                     <item n="10">X. When you grill any thing, let it be over a
ſtove of charcoal, rather than ſea-coal; it makes
it eat ſweeter and ſhorter; turn your meat very
often.</item>
