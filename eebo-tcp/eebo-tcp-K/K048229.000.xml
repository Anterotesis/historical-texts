            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>FINDING among the different pieces I have compoſed for Ranelagh and the Theatre a number of Ballads which I took great pains with, and which have been but little heard, I thought I could not better employ my leiſure time than in furniſhing upon ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar plan the dialogue neceſſary to work up theſe materials into a Ballad Farce, a ſpecies of entertainment which has always been well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and which as it has lain dormant for ſome time, I thought would have ſo far the charms of novelty to recommend it.</p>
            <p>I had heard of a piece of this ſort, which has the characters of a Waterman and a Gardener in it; and the ſcene of which is laid at Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſea: This I enquired after, but was informed it was out of print; I nevertheleſs liked the idea of thoſe two characters ſo well, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0054901100:4"/>
to purſue the hint as for as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for my purpoſe; I dare ſay it muſt be evident to every one that I have done no more; I never read the piece in queſtion, nor do I for a certainty at this moment know the title of it.</p>
            <p>I mention this circumſtance becauſe I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to acknowledge at all times from whence I collect any matter for the trifles I may have an opportunity of preſenting to the public. I muſt be an egregious egotiſt indeed, and little entitled to the indulgence they have hitherto favoured me with, if I could be ſo unconſcious of my own inability as to ſuppoſe I ever can preſent them with any thing worthy their notice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſiſtance of this ſort; beſide, in this I am ſerving myſelf, for I muſt be well convinced, the moſt effectual way to ſecure their indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is to deal as honeſtly by them as they deal generouſly by every man in my ſituation.</p>
            <p>With regard to the performers, if I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the merit of any one in particular, I
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0054901100:5"/>
ſhould do injuſtice to the reſt; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay in general, that their aſſiduity has been unwearied upon this, as well as upon every other ſimilar occaſion.</p>
            <p>The piece is indeed incomparably performed, and it is very apparent that the greateſt part of its ſucceſs is owing to this circumſtance.</p>

                  <p>This, now, is my delight, to ſit at breakfaſt while the men work. Come, honeſt Tom, let us make an end of our tankard, before my wife gets up; her raking ſo in London, (where between you and I, ſhe ſtays a deviliſh deal longer than while ſhe ſells the ſparrow-graſs) keeps her a-bed woundy late of a morning.</p>

                  <p>No, nor then neither; every thing muſt be her way, or there's no getting any peace. As ſoon as the marketing's over in town, away ſhe and her favourite Robin, trudge to the two-ſhilling gallery of one of the play-houſes; where they have pick'd up ſuch a pack of damn'd nonſenſe, about ſentiments and ſtuff, that I am not only obliged to put up with her ſcolding me all the time I do ſee her, but I am ſcolded in a language I don't underſtand.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>TUG.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Madam Bundle, be'n't you ſome how or other afraid, that what with one thing, and what with another, you'll hop all the money out of your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's pocket?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. BUN.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't direct my diſcourſe to you, Sir; but tis my huſband that encourages you to behave in ſuch a brutiſh and outrageous manner. He has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed you I know, that you ſhall have my daughter, but I'll make him know who's at home—I will:—I'll aſſure you, indeed!—Such a fellow as you!—A naſty, idling, ſcurvy rapſcallion, that leads a filthy, drunken, lazy life; ſotting in one ale-houſe, and ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in another; and ſhall ſuch a low brute dare to expire to the honour of marrying Miſs Wilelmina Bundle?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>TUG.</speaker>
                  <p>I'll tell you what, Ma'am Bundle, I ſhould not care much for marrying your daughter, if ſhe was not of a little better temper than yourſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. BUN.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, the villain!—Why you vile, wicked—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>BUN.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear, how can you put yourſelf in ſuch a paſſion, you, you know, who are ſuch a tame creature—one that never ſcolds, or riots?—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. BUN.</speaker>
                  <p>I'll riot you all to ſome tune, I will—therefore Mr. Bundle, unleſs you wou'd have me ſue for a ſeparate maintainance—mind what I ſay—next time I go to London, I ſhall take Robin with me to Doctor's Commons, and nothing but your conſent to his marrying your daughter, ſhall ever make me look upon you again.</p>

                  <p>Well, 'tis a moſt charming thing to plague theſe creatures—die for me—If I had not given myſelf ſome airs to him, he never cou'd have thought of ſuch a thing; but that's the way, if one does not uſe them like dogs, there's no getting any thing civil from them—but here comes Robin, I muſt plague him in another way.</p>

                  <p>Miſs Wilelmina, may I have the unſpeakable happineſs to tell you, how much words fall ſhort of the great honour, you wou'd prefer upon me, if you wou'd grant me the requeſt, of favouring me with your hand this evening at the hop.</p>

                  <p>What inclination, Miſs! aſk the plants why they love a ſhower? aſk the ſun-flower why it loves the ſun? aſk the ſnow-drop why it is white? aſk the violet why it is blue? aſk the trees why they bloſſom? the cabages why they grow?

                  <speaker>ROB.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, you never heard me ſay this in your life—now mind. My heart is for all the world juſt like a hot-bed, where the ſeed of affection, ſown by your matchleſs charms, and warmed by that ſun, your

eyes, became a beautiful flower, which is juſt now full blown; and all I deſires, Miſs, is that you'll condeſcend to gather it and ſtick in your boſom.</p>

                  <p>Reſiſting me, Miſs! no I don't know how you ſhou'd; my heart is ſtock'd with love, as a flower garden is ſtock'd with flowers. The Cupids that have fled from your eyes and taken ſhelter there, are as much out of number as the leaves on a tree, or the colours in a bed of tulips; You are to me what the ſummer is to the garden, and if you don't revive me with the ſun-ſhine of your favour, I ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with the weeds of diſappointment, and choak'd up with the brambles of deſpair.</p>

                  <p>Yes, but I hope I ſhan't have ſuch a crank and humourſome piece of ſtuff to deal with as you have; I don't know not I, but for my ſhare, I can't ſee why married people mayn't be happy as well as others; 'tis my mind, Miſs here, is trying which is the moſt loving of us two, and if ſo I wou'd not give my little Robin three-pence for his chance, for I know as well as can be, that he has no more notion of making a woman happy than nothing at all—but here ſhe comes.</p>

                  <speaker>TUG.</speaker>
                  <p>Why no, Miſs, I e'n't yet gone, I am in hopes there will be no occaſion, if there ſhould, I am always one of my word.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>WIL.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, you unkind creature! to diſappoint me ſo, I was in hopes by this time to have received a long letter from you, upbraiding me with my cruelty, and telling me that you were gone abroad with a broken heart at being diſappointed of me.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>TUG.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Miſs, as to breaking my heart, to be ſure I ſhould go well-nigh to do that, if I could not perſuade you to have me; but I have been thinking that it would be better to try if I can't ſtay at home, and do ſomething to obtain your conſent, for to be ſure the pleaſure of having you, is not what every body deſerves.</p>

                  <speaker>TUG.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, you know that the young watermen are to row for the Coat and Badge this afternoon, and ſo I have made bold to beſpeak a room at the Swan, for you and your friends to go and ſee the ſight.</p>

                  <speaker>TUG.</speaker>
                  <p>And do you think now, if ever I was to do any thing with an intent to pleaſe you, that you cou'd bring yourſelf to look upon me with kindneſs?</p>
               </sp>
