            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Obſervations on the <hi>Fifth Article of the Treaty of UNION,</hi> humbly offered to the Conſideration of the Parliament, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Foreign Ships.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Matter of Difficulty upon this Head, I take to be as follows. — By the Article, all Ships, any of whoſe Owners were Foreigners at the Signing of the Treaty, ſhall be Deem'd ſtill Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bottoms within the Terms of the Act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of this is plain, Moſt of the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping employ'd on the South-Eaſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bottoms, and ſeverals of them own'd by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, principally <hi>Dutch.</hi> Now, as <hi>England</hi> is very careful to Encourage her own Shipping; and as <hi>Britain</hi> will after the Union ſtill be ſo the Encreaſe, Employment and Building of Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Principal Foundations of her Wealth. — It would be hard to admit any Ships, which are Foreign built, to be free Ships in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when none that are ſo in <hi>England</hi> can be admitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> freely admits all Ships built in <hi>Scotland</hi> to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0129701600:2"/>
be free in all the Ports and Trade of <hi>Britain;</hi> — Nay, to go further, <hi>England</hi> allows by the Union, even <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, if bought by <hi>Scots</hi> Men, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Scots</hi> Owners, to be free, which is more than any <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> can be allow'd. — Nay, If a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign built Ship lay now at <hi>Leith</hi> Road, and her Owners were all <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> ſhe would not be Deem'd a free Ship by the Union, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Owners would looſe the benefit of employing her; and the Reaſon of this is, to Encourage our own Shipping, on which ſo much depends, and this Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit will be plainly <hi>Scotland's</hi> at laſt.</p>
            <p>But the Objection here, is, We have a great many Ships in our Trade that are Foreign built, and that are chiefly own'd by <hi>Scots-men,</hi> but perhaps may have one or more Owners abroad; and it would be hard that theſe <hi>Scots-men</hi> ſhould loſe the Benefit of their Ships which they employ in the Trade of their Native Country, only becauſe they have ſome <hi>Dutch-men</hi> concerned with them, — when at the ſame time 'tis plain, that if theſe <hi>Dutch-men</hi> were not concerned, the Trade of <hi>Scotland</hi> would with great difficulty be carried on.</p>
            <p>The Expedient propoſed for this, as I meet with it, is, That a reaſonable time ſhould be given for the Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> to buy out their <hi>Dutch</hi> Owners or ſell their own Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0129701600:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Or that it ſhould have been ſaid, All Ships &amp;c. whoſe Owners were <hi>Scots-men,</hi> at the End, or Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Treaty, &amp;c. ſince till the Treaty is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, every <hi>Scots-man</hi> has a Right to employ any Ship whatever.</p>
            <p>To Anſwer this, I crave leave to ſay, That this tho plauſible in its ſelf, has yet Inconveniencies of a nature Intolerable, becauſe by this, any Man in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> may in the name of <hi>Scotſmen,</hi> Buy what number of Ships in <hi>Holland</hi> they pleaſe, and at the end of the Union, they become free Ships, to the general Ruine of the Shipping in the whole Iſland.</p>
            <p>And this was Remarkably true, to <hi>England</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Loſs, when in the laſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War, the Ships taken from <hi>Holland</hi> as Prize, were made free, the People bought <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, cauſed ſham Privateers to take them, and for ſeveral years, ſome hundereds of them were Imployed in their Coal Trade, to the Ruine of the Town of <hi>Ipſwick,</hi> where all the large Coal Ships uſed to be Built, — which Loſs that Town never recovered.</p>
            <p>To give a time therefore, to have all Ships Own'd by <hi>Scotſmen</hi> come in to be free, is to open a Door to a Miſchief, which it cannot be deſired, <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſuffer in Trade; and the value now ſuppoſed to be Toucht here, is but very ſmall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0129701600:4"/>
All that I can ſee in this, is, That a <hi>Medium</hi> be found out, which if it muſt be, tho I do not grant that neceſſity neither, <hi>is this,</hi> That <hi>at the time of the Treaty,</hi> the MAJOR PART of ſuch Veſſel did belong to the Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I confeſs this ſeems to have ſome colour of Reaſon in it, that the Majority ſhould Denominate the whole, and I would hope <hi>England</hi> would not Diſpute it, ſince they do not deny any Foreigners, Holding or Owning any Share of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel, but the Legitimacy of the Veſſel conſiſts in her Bottom.</p>
            <p>Now if the Majority of Owners as to the Value, I mean, were not <hi>Scots,</hi> no Ship can be accounted Legitimate. If a <hi>Scots</hi> Merchant Owns ⅜ of a Ship, and a <hi>Dutchman</hi> ⅝ ſhe cannot be accounted in Reaſon, any thing but a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship, eſpecially when her Bottom is <hi>Dutch</hi> too, for the Denomination muſt go with the Major; and it's not the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant is a part Owner of the <hi>Scotſman</hi>'s Ship, but the <hi>Scotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is a part Owner of the <hi>Dutchman</hi>'s Ship.</p>
            <p>This ſmall <hi>Medium,</hi> I think, will reduce this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to a Square, and an Explanatorie Clauſe to that purpoſe, will in two Lines determine that Point.</p>
            <closer>All which is Humbly Remitted to the Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Right Honourable the Eſtates of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</closer>
