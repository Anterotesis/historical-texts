            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>SIGISMOND, the ſon of the Emperor Charles IV. was elected King of Hungary 1386, and Emperor of Germany 1410. His firſt wife, Mary, being dead, he eſpouſed, about the year 1414, Barbara, the daughter of Hernan, Count of Cilley. Sigiſmond made the Counts of Cilley independent Princes of the Empire; and called them to the Diets, without the conſent of the Houſe of Auſtria, their ſupreme Lords, who, unwilling to emancipate the County from its depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon them, declared war againſt the Count in poſſeſſion. By Barbara, Sigiſmond had only one child, a daughter, named Elizabeth. Sigiſmond died 1437.</p>
               <p>Albert V. Duke of Auſtria, who had married Elizabeth, Sigiſmond's daughter, ſucceeded him in the Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary. Albert died 1440, leaving two daughters; his Queen Elizabeth was big with child at the time of his death; the child proved a ſon, and was named Ladiſlaus.</p>
               <p>Upon the death of Albert II. as Emperor, and V. as Duke of Auſtria, his couſin, Frederick, great grandſon of Albert II. Duke of Auſtria, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately elected Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0536800300:17"/>The Hungarians, almoſt conſtantly engaged in war againſt the Turks, either for the defence of their own country, or of the neighbouring ſtates, deemed an infant Prince and a Queen Regent unequal to the ſafe government of a kingdom which, by frequent wars, was kept in continual alarm. The crown of Hungary, by the conſtitution of the kingdom, being elective, (though ſometimes poſſeſſed in hereditary ſucceſſion) Uladiſlaus, the young King of Poland, was choſen King, by the advice of John Corvin Huniades, Earl of Biſtrie, whom Uladiſlaus made Vaywode of Tranſylvania. Huniades was as cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for his virtues as for his valour. He was pious towards God, faithful to his country and his prince, and kind and benevolent to his friends; as a warrior he was politic, of invincible courage, and moſtly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate: he was the firſt Chriſtian commander who ſhowed that the Turks might be overcome; and he obtained more victories againſt them than any one of the Chriſtian Princes before him<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir William Temple ſays that, "Huniades was one of the three Worthies who deſerved a Crown without wearing one." The reward, merited by the virtues and great talents of the father, was paid to the ſon; for in 1458, the Hungarians, from their love to Huniades, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remembrance of his long ſervices, choſe his ſon, Matthias Corvinus, for their King.</note>.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth, unable to prevent this choice, put her ſon, Uladiſlaus, under the protection of the Emperor Frederick III. Thus, of Albert's poſſeſſions, only Auſtria, and the kingdom of Bohemia, remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienated from his poſthumous ſon, Ladiſlaus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0536800300:18"/>In the battle of Varna, 1444, fought between the Turks, commanded by their King, Amurath II. and the Hungarians, led by Huniades, Uladiſlaus the King of Hungary was ſlain; Huniades, by whoſe ſide he fought, having left him to go and rally the left wing of the Chriſtian army.</p>
               <p>The Hungarians now elected Albert's ſon Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaus King; and they choſe Huniades, their General, Governor of Hungary during his minority. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Frederick detaining the infant King in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Huniades, as Governor of Hungary, declared war againſt him. After a long conteſt, which the Hungarians were obliged to intermit, on account of their wars againſt the Turks, the Emperor, not ſtrong enough to defend his dominions from being ravaged by the incurſions of the Hungarians, at laſt in 1452 delivered up their king; then eleven years of age. An aſſembly was appointed at Vienna, to which the nobles of Hungary and Bohemia were invited. At this aſſembly it was decreed that, during the minority of Ladiſlaus, Huniades ſhould govern Hungary; that George Podiebrad ſhould govern Bohemia; and that Ulrick, Count of Cilley, great uncle to the King, ſhould govern Auſtria, and be guardian of his perſon.</p>
               <p>Count Cilley, envious of the glory of Huniades, excited ſome parties of Bohemians and Moravians to attack Upper Auſtria: but they proved unſucceſsful when oppoſed by Huniades. Ambitious of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of Hungary, Count Cilley accuſed Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niades, the Governor, to the King; but he juſtified
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0536800300:19"/>
himſelf from the accuſation. Count Cilley's ambition increaſing with the power which he derived from being the King's guardian; he attempted to make himſelf abſolute maſter of Auſtria. To effect which, he ſecured the principal fortreſſes, by giving them to the command of unprincipled people whom he had attached to his intereſt; gradually removing Elſinger, and the Auſtrian nobility, from all offices of import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. This conduct gave great umbrage to the people. Elſinger took advantage of their diſcontent; and, aided by Huniades, obliged Ulrick to retire to his own territory of Cilley. Thus, by the bravery and conduct of theſe two warriors, Auſtria was wreſted from Count Cilley's uſurpation.</p>
               <p>Mahomet II. the ſeventh King, and the firſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the Turks, who took Conſtantinople May 29, 1453, which his great grandfather, Bajazet I. and his father Amurath II. had unſucceſsfully beſieged, marched 1456<note n="*" place="bottom">New Univerſal Hiſtory, vol. XXVI. p. 296, there is a miſtake in the date of this Siege of Belgrade, which is there put down A.D. 1459; and in vol. XXXII. p. 149, the date is 1456, which laſt agrees with other Hiſtorians.</note> with an army of 150,000 men to beſiege Belgrade, then thought the key to Hungary.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the report of Mahomet's intention to beſiege Belgrade, reached the young King Ladiſlaus, then fifteen years of age, he fled to the court of the Emperor Frederick; which much diſpleaſed his Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian ſubjects, as it had before coſt them a long and tedious conteſt to get him out of the Emperor's power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0536800300:20"/>Beſides his numerous army, of 150,000 men, Mahomet provided a fleet, of 200 ſhips and gallies, which he ſent up the Danube from Viden to Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade; to the intent that no relief, or aid, ſhould be brought into the city out of Hungary by the great rivers of the Danube and the Save; upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of which, the city of Belgrade ſtands. Not contented with thus cloſely blockading the city on all ſides, Mahomet ſent part of his fleet further up the Danube, and landing troops ſpoiled the country in many places on the banks of the river. On his firſt coming before Belgrade, he made a fierce aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, but was repulſed: he found the Hungarians ready to receive him, and prepared to ſkirmiſh with his troops, without the walls, as well as to defend the city. Mahomet, finding his arms ſo reſolutely oppoſed, began to proceed more warily; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched his army. He provided for its ſafety, againſt the ſudden ſallies of the beſieged, by caſting up deep trenches and ſtrong rampires. After plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his battery, he began to ſhake the wall of the city moſt furiouſly with his great artillery: inſomuch that he battered down a part of it level with the ground. But the defendants with great labour and induſtry ſpeedily repaired it, by caſting up new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications and rampires, ſo that it was ſtronger than before.</p>
               <p>Campeſtran, a Franciſcan monk, having at this time preached, in Germany, a cruſade againſt the Turks, had collected an army of 40,000 men. With
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0536800300:21"/>
theſe, his followers, he entered Belgrade to aſſiſt in its defence againſt Mahomet, who was become the terror of all Chriſtendom by his conqueſts, his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing genius, his capacious mind improved by all the learning of the age, his indefatigable induſtry in the purſuit of whatever he undertook, his irreſiſtible courage, his inſatiable cruelty, his avowed impiety, his blood-thirſtineſs, his immeaſurable ambition, his impious treachery, and his unrelenting flinty-hearted ſeverity; ſo that againſt his ambition there was no mound, on his faith or friendſhip no dependance, and in his leaſt diſpleaſure death.</p>
               <p>Huniades, who was gone to Upper Hungary, to raiſe ſupplies, was expected to ſail from Buda, with a fleet of ſhips and gallies ſtored with warlike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; when Mahomet, having been a month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Belgrade, prepared to give a general aſſault, although his ſuperſtitious troops were much diſpirited from the appearance of two comets<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ohſſon's Hiſt. Gen. of the Othoman Empire, vol. 1. p. 539.</note>; and the death of Carazius the Lieutenant-General, who was killed by a canon-ſhot from the city; which circumſtances they conſidered as prognoſticks of ill ſucceſs. At this time, A. D. 1456, Auguſt 5, the fleet of Huniades came in ſight, and was met by Mahomet's fleet four miles up the Danube beyond Belgrade.</p>

So, Mademoiſelle! unleſs you mend your manners and alter you conduct, your fate will be, to wear the Veil,—eat Soup meager, ſleep in a Dormitory, and do Pennance for the remainder of your days.—</p>

                     <p>Lord, Madam! I thought my father would be there; and I was ſo wearied out, laſt night, with hearing of my ungrateful, rebellious conduct, of my incorrigible vulgarity, of my want of taſte and judgment; and of what a diſgrace I am to his name and blood; that I was truly glad to eſcape from his paſſionate exclamations, which gall and irritate me ſo, that I am forced to ſay things which he does not like.—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Marchioneſs.</speaker>
                     <p>Adelinda! you muſt take care how you provoke your Father: you made him ſo very angry laſt night that I trembled for you.</p>

                     <speaker>Adelinda.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, there was reaſon to tremble. I expect that he will give me a good beating in one of his paſſions: for, ſure, never was mortal in ſuch a rage, as he was in with me, laſt night. It is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate for me, that I have either eyes, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or the uſe of ſpeech: ſince I can neither look, think, nor ſpeak, without putting my father into a moſt horrible pucker.</p>

                     <p>It was impoſſible to forbear from being angry with you laſt night. I aſſure you, that I ſhould have joined in reſenting your behaviour, but your father's ſevere determination, after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you from his preſence, terrified me to death; and I forgot my own diſpleaſure againſt you, in my

He is juſtice herſelf, he holds the ſcales with a ſteady hand, and wields the ſword with unrelenting rigour;—except when he is himſelf the culprit. But thanks to you, Madam! for interpoſing, ſo that he has broken the Oath; 't was raſhly made; and not fit to be kept: but in his next paſſion, he will again ſwear, and as eaſily break the vow.</p>

Therefore, my dear Child! this is the criſis of your fate; and I am trembling for your future happineſs, with all the anxiety of a Mother, who ſees the rock, upon which your heedleſs youth will drive, to its aſſured deſtruction.</p>

The ſociety which delights you, is not my element: and I ſhall never be any thing in it, but a queer fiſh gaping and floundering about.

and very young, as ſhe has loſt her Father, whom I very much reſpected, I think her intitled to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; therefore, know certainly your own mind about this girl, before you lay ſiege to her heart. Your pride may ſtep in now, but I tell you, that it ſhall not afterwards. You have had ſeveral attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo I ſuſpect your conſtancy in this; and I will allow of no foolery in this affair: you have my conſent to court her for your wife; but not to dangle after her for your amuſement, and then leave her to wear the willow.</p>

Is that the girl who is thought ſo pretty? I met the Marquis, and he praiſed her ſo highly, that my curioſity brings me to ſee if ſhe be ſuch a peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs damſel.—That muſt be ſhe, with her back turned to us. What a fine figure ſhe is! does her face cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to it?</p>

My heart has made no choice.

ready—My plans were laid, my Brother is preparing for our flight, and to fly with us—but this night—we cannot fly this night—no precautions taken—my Brother abſent—for, as ſoon as he had joined our hands, he ſat off for the coaſt, in order to ſecure a ſhip.</p>

                     <p>Adelinda! if you ſaw my heart, though it beats with fear, yet it is not for myſelf, but for you. A moment of diſtraction, in ſpite of all my duty to my Maſter, and all my reſpect for you, made me diſcover my hopeleſs paſſion; you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned this act of preſumption and deſpair—you, like an angel, heard and pitied my ſufferings,—fatally heard, and pitied them, till you ſhared them. O Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda! do you not hate me, do you not deſpiſe the ſelfiſhneſs, that had not the courage to be wretched by itſelf? I ſee with deep repentance, for your ſake, the dreadful abyſs into which you are going to be plunged. Into what peril have I betrayed you!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adelinda.</speaker>
                     <p>The peril is equal for both.—Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for each other has been highly blameable:—but it is too late now for repentance. The hazard of our enterpriſe is not ſo great as you imagine.</p>

I believe you: for when a man is diſintereſted enough to reſign all hopes of fortune, and runs the hazard of his life for marrying his maſter's daughter,—he certainly loves her to deſperation. We muſt part now, for ſear we be ſurpriſed. Meet me in an hour in the Alcove

                     <p>I AM aſtoniſhed that Straſbourg, who thinks himſelf ſo adorable and a match for a Princeſs, ſhould condeſcend to think of the Daughter of Dorcas for a Wife. My Lord's interfering and breaking off the match is to be ſure a very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtep; yet I cannot think it a ſufficient reaſon for your ſuſpicions.</p>

                     <p>My ſuſpicions, as you well know, Madam! have been but too often right. And my Lord Marquis has had too many intrigues, for me, not to ſuſpect him very much, of entering into a new one, when he prevents a pretty girl's marriage, and takes away her Mother's authority, by declaring himſelf her Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</p>

                     <p>Yes, Madam! and Straſbourg is quite jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous about it.—I heard but little, for it was Lucy whom he charged with the embaſſy to you, but ſhe begged me to tell it to you. I believe that ſhe thinks as I do, for ſhe ſeemed half frighted out of her wits: ſhe ſays that Straſbourg has puzzled and confounded
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0536800300:316"/>
her, by telling her of his jealouſy. I queſtioned her; but ſhe ſaid ſhe dared not ſpeak what ſhe thought: and ran away from me. I knew not what to think of her flutterings; perhaps ſhe is in love with him herſelf.</p>

                     <p>Well! do not tell me of ſuch ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of ſuſpicions; I have enough for ſerious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, without anticipating vexations.</p>

                     <p>But, Madam! Straſbourg ſays, that he will lay his life, that the Marquis has deſigns upon the Girl; and that he will find her a very eaſy conqueſt, unleſs you interpoſe. Yet he charged Lucy not to tell you, that my Lord was in love with her, for fear of making you uneaſy; but he is ſure that he is; and that the girl perceives it, and that as ſhe is quite a village coquette, an artful little monkey, ſhe will know how to ſecure her conqueſt.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Marchioneſs.</speaker>
                     <p>I hope that my Lord is more hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable than to ſeduce her.</p>

                     <p>You may hope it, Madam! but you will be diſappointed. If I were you, I would order the little baggage into my preſence, box her ears, and command her to be turned out of doors. She ſhould not ſtay a minute under my roof.</p>

                     <p>Such conduct would ill become any woman. And though my Lord appears to be relapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his former errours, yet who knows, but what he may have ſome praiſeworthy motive for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>

and I could bite my fingers for madneſs, to ſee how you appear to ſtudy to deceive yourſelf. When I am ſure, Madam! that, in your heart, you muſt be as unhappy, as jealouſy, that worſt of demons, can make you.

Her grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, her underſtanding, her beauty, are enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the delicate modeſty of her deportment adds a thouſand winning graces to the bloom of youth, in the moſt lovely, animated countenance, that I ever beheld.</p>

                     <p>Zella, Madam! did not want to have her obedience to her Mother enforced upon her. The ſweet Girl was ready to obey her unfeeling mandate, with all the reſpectful ſubmiſſion of a Daughter, and all the reſignation of a martyr. I declare to you, Madam! that, but for her tears, I ſhould have thought an angel ſtood before me, when, after pleading for pity in vain, ſhe ſpoke the ſtrong ſenſe which ſhe had of her duty to her Mother, and of her reſolution to obey her, though at the price of all her future happineſs. Then, and not till then, I interpoſed my authority in her favour. The thoughts of her being devoted to miſery pierced my heart with grief; whilſt the fortitude of her reſignation almoſt awed me. I cannot conſent that ſhe ſhall be driven to deſpair; it would be a deep ſuffering to myſelf.</p>

                     <p>Zella! pity is not always reſtrained within proper bounds—I am neither unkind, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, nor willingly ſuſpicious: but Straſbourg is jealous, and you know very well his reaſons for being ſo.</p>

in the honeſt ſincerity of my heart, I declared before the Marquis. Orphaned as I am, he had the goodneſs to promiſe, that he would ſupply my Father's place, and, like an indulgent Father, he ſet aſide the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement which my Mother had entered into, ſo very contrary to my inclinations. Indeed, Madam! had I been forced to fulfil it, my future life, ſhort, as I hope, it would have been, would have run in one continued ſtream of grief, diſguſt, and wretchedneſs.</p>

                     <p>I have been upon the watch; and, as I ſaw nobody about; ſo I ſafely purſue my own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Love, by my hands, preſents you with theſe jewels. They never gave me a moment's pleaſure till now; for I deteſt the fatiguing pomp which obliged me to wear them. But, at this moment, I rejoice in having them, to give to you, as ſome compenſation, for the lucrative poſt which you quit for my ſake.</p>

                     <p>True, Straſbourg! and ſo it would, if I did not quit my inheritance, through regard for you. But whilſt my father lives, no part of his wealth, by any right, can be mine, unleſs by his own free gift: and of that all hopes muſt be reſigned:—for you cannot, even think, that he will ever be won to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me.</p>

can ſupport and prop the grandeur of his illuſtrious houſe; you have no Father in my Maſter, I promiſe you. Therefore I have taken theſe bills, becauſe we ſhall never have but this only opportunity of helping ourſelves.

I muſt leave you now: but remark what a change the next twenty-four hours will make in me; and how gratefully I ſhall prove my obligations to you, for giving me your advice, and thus kindly becoming my friend.

And how liberal he is not to mind my having ſo little money—"His heart faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates him to a moſt amiable woman, who has juſt convinced him, that ſhe has the virtue, ſenſe, and purity of an Angel."—What an elegant way he has of turning a compliment. He is quite a fine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be ſure. "The virtue, ſenſe, and purity of an Angel." Oh! bow I ſhall be envied, for many a heart aches, and will ache, for Monſieur Straſbourg.</p>

Surely, my love may hope for your pity; if you will not reward it by a richer gift,—your heart. Say then, in kind commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for my ſuffering love, that you will pity me. Whence this fullen ſilence, this ſoul-piercing Scorn?</p>

How inſidious are you, my Lord! thus pretending to admire my beauty, whilſt you are ſeeking to deſtroy it; for by invading the innocent ſerenity of my boſom, you would cover my face with the pale hue of diſcontent, and drown my eyes with tears. How ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and artful it is to plead your paſſion for me, which ſeeks only my deſtruction. How mean and contemptible to aſk my love or implore my pity. Why ſhould I love you? What pity, or what tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can my mind feel for you? You yourſelf, my Lord! now teach me what regard I ought to have for

And if you would have liſtened to my

My real Father's Brother brought me, within this hour, that letter.—My poor Father found out the deceit; but my unhappy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's threats prevented him from revealing it till he was upon his death-bed: when he told it to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and with ſuch circumſtances as avouch the

                  <p>HENRY De S—, Baron of D—, was betrothed to Eulalia De L—e, a Daughter of the Marquis De L—e. An offer more ſuitable to the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious views of the Marquis, being made to him, for his Daughter; he compelled her to write a refuſal to her firſt Lover, which was accompanied by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory one from himſelf. The young Lord, unable to bear the thoughts of ſeeing the amiable woman he doated on given in marriage to another, ſecretly quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his houſe; leaving a letter behind him, written in a ſtyle which indicated a mind bordering on deſpair and madneſs, declaring that all ſearch after him would be in vain; deſiring, in a formal manner, that his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might, as his Heir, take poſſeſſion of his Titles and Eſtate, giving to Eulalia De L—e, all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of which he had a right to diſpoſe. Let her be told, adds the unhappy De S—, "that this muſt be looked on as a Brother's, not a Lover's gift: that Duty and Virtue forbid the Wife of the Duke of — to ſhed one tear of Love, to the Memory of the Baron De S—; let one wretched Victim to affection ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0536800300:391"/>
—let him be forgotten.—May Heaven bleſs her. —Give her, great God! the happineſs which might have fallen to my ſhare!—add my date of days to hers!!—!"</p>
                  <p>When this young Nobleman diſappeared, it was imagined from the whole tenor of his incoherent Letter, addreſſed to ſeveral friends, in different parts, but directed to no one; from his taking nothing of value with him, and leaving even his purſe in his inkſtand, that he left his houſe with an intention of putting an end to his Life. And, though after the moſt careful ſearch, his body was not found, yet it was ſtill believed that he had completed his ſhocking purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Diſguiſed in the Habit of a Pilgrim, Henry De S— went to the Abbey of La Trappe, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Perche, in the dioceſe of Séez. He gained admiſſion. And the Father Abbot immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him into the fraternity. The Rules of this order are more auſtere than thoſe of any other of the Romiſh Church. Perpetual ſilence is enjoined to the Monks. They are allowed neither to receive nor write letters. None of their friends may ſee them, ſo that they are totally ignorant of what paſſes in the World. Their only food is Bread and Pulſe; their drink Water. Meat, Fiſh, Eggs, Milk, Butter, Wine and Oil, are forbidden to them.—They are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſtudy. The Bible, and a very few books of ſevere morality and ſelf-denial, compoſe the whole Library of a Monk of La Trappe. They live a very
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0536800300:392"/>
laborious Life, cultivating the earth, or following ſome manual employment, ſuch as they are found moſt fitted for. The Father Abbot only is allowed to ſpeak. When they are in the laſt agonies of Life, they are placed on a Bier covered with Straw and Aſhes; and carried into the Church. They lie on this Bier till they expire: and if they retain the power of ſpeech, in this laſt ſtrife of Nature, their Vow of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is diſpenſed with; in order that they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort their Brethren: this permiſſion has ſometimes given riſe to very affecting ſcenes and diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>The uncommon ſeverities which the young Baron De S— was obliged, by the Rules, to practiſe in the Monaſtery of La Trappe, injured his health. He had ſound retirement, but not peace. The continual agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his mind, which converſe with the friendly part of the World might have relieved, diſturbed his reaſon, after he had been in this gloomy ſolitude two years. The Monks of La Trappe dig a part of their Grave at certain ſtated hours: Whilſt employed in this occupation, Henry's now weakened mind pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured the form of his once-loved miſtreſs ſinking into it: This impreſſion once made upon his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſtantly returned, at the ſame place, and time. His reaſon was not enough extinguiſhed to make him ſuppoſe Eulalia really preſent; but the picture once formed by his diſordered imagination was ſo ſtrong, that he thought it a Viſion: Impreſſed from this Idea, the coinage of his weakened reaſon, he determined, difficult and dangerous as the execution of ſuch a
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0536800300:393"/>
deſign was, to eſcape from La Trappe: as he thought that Eulalia's appearance to him indicated a want of ſome aſſiſtance, which it might be in his power to give to her. Forbidden by the Rules of his order to ſpeak but in prayer; and all the Brethren avoiding one another, except at Church, as much as poſſible; the ſtate of Henry's mind, balancing between reaſon and madneſs, of which he himſelf at times was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, eſcaped obſervation. He got away amongſt a number of Pilgrims who came to La Trappe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſome acts of devotion; diſguiſed in the very dreſs which he had on two years before, when he entered the Monaſtery.—How or where he parted from the other Pilgrims is not known.</p>

Henry accepted of his offer, and, ſomewhat calmed, ſpent the remaining part of the night in prayer.</p>
