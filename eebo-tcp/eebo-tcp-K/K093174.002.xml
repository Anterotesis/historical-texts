            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.</head>
               <p>AT the time when Fairies and Genii poſſeſſed the powers which they have now loſt, there lived in the country of the Brachmans a man named <hi>Indur,</hi> who was diſtinguiſhed, not only for that gentleneſs of diſpoſition and humanity towards all living creatures, which are ſo much cultivated among thoſe people, but for an inſatiable curioſity reſpecting the nature and way of life of all animals. In purſuit of knowledge of this kind he would frequently ſpend the night among lonely rocks, or in the midſt of thick foreſts; and there, under ſhelter of a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0191002602:5"/>
hanging cliff, or mounted upon a high tree, he would watch the motions and actions of all the animals that ſeek their prey in the night; and remaining in the ſame ſpot till the break of day, he would obſerve this tribe of creatures retiring to their dens, and all others coming forth to enjoy the beams of the riſing ſun. On theſe occaſions, if he ſaw any opportunity of exerciſing his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towards animals in diſtreſs, he never failed to make uſe of it; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times reſcued the ſmall birds from the pityleſs hawk, and the lamb or kid from the gripe of the wolf and lynx. One day, as he was ſitting on a tree in the foreſt, a little frolicſome monkey, in taking a great leap from one bough to another, chanced to miſs his hold, and fell from a great height to the ground. As he lay there unable to move, <hi>Indur</hi> eſpied a large venomous ſerpent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to make the poor defenceleſs creature his prey. He immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0191002602:6"/>
from his poſt, and taking the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle monkey in his arms, ran with it to the tree, and gently placed it upon a bough. In the mean time, the enraged ſerpent purſuing him, overtook him before he could mount the tree, and bit him in the leg. Preſently, the limb began to ſwell, and the effects of the venom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came viſible over <hi>Indur</hi>'s whole frame. He grew faint, ſick, and pale; and ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ground, was ſenſible that his laſt moments were faſt approaching. As thus he lay, he was ſurpriſed to hear a human voice from the tree; and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, he beheld, on the bough where he had placed the monkey, a beautiful woman, who thus addreſſed him:—<q rend="inline">"<hi>Indur,</hi> I am truly grieved, that thy kindneſs to me ſhould have been the cauſe of thy deſtruction. Know, that in the form of the poor monkey, it was the potent fairy <hi>Perezinda</hi> to whom thou gaveſt ſuccour. Obliged to paſs a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of days every year under
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0191002602:7"/>
the ſhape of an animal, I had choſen this form; and though not mortal, I ſhould have ſuffered extreme agonies from the bite of the ſerpent, hadſt thou not ſo humanely aſſiſted me. It is not in my power to prevent the fatal effect of the poiſon; but I am able to grant thee any wiſh thou ſhalt form reſpecting the future ſtate of exiſtence to which thou art now haſtening. Speak, then, before it be too late, and let me ſhow my gratitude."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">—"Great Perezinda!"</q> replied <hi>Indur,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"ſince you deign ſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly to return my ſervice, this is the requeſt that I make: In all my tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations may I retain a rational ſoul, with the memory of the adventures I have gone through; and when death ſets me free from one body, may I inſtantly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate another in the prime of its powers and faculties, without paſſing through the helpleſs ſtate of infancy."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">—"It is granted,"</q> anſwered the Fairy; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately breaking a ſmall branch from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0191002602:8"/>
the tree, and breathing on it, ſhe threw it down to <hi>Indur,</hi> and bid him hold it faſt in his hand. He did ſo, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently expired.</p>
               <p>Inſtantly, he found himſelf in a green valley by the ſide of a clear ſtream, grazing amid a herd of <hi>Antelopes.</hi> He admired his elegant ſhape, ſleek ſpotted ſkin, and poliſhed ſpiral horns; and drank with delight of the cool rivulet, cropt the juicy herb, and ſported with his companions. Soon, an alarm was given of the approach of an enemy; and they all ſet off with the ſwiſneſs of the wind to the neighbouring immenſe plains, where they were ſoon out of the reach of injury. <hi>Indur</hi> was highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the eaſe and rapidity of his motions; and ſnuffing the keen air of the deſart, bounded away, ſcarcely deign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to touch the ground with his feet. This way of life went on very pleaſantly for ſome time, till at length the herd was one morning alarmed with noiſes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0191002602:9"/>
of trumpets, drums, and loud ſhouts, on every ſide. They ſtarted, and ran firſt to the right, then to the left, but were continually driven back by the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crowd, which now appeared to be a whole army of hunters, with the king of the country and all his nobles, aſſembled on a ſolemn chace, after the manner of the eaſtern people. And now the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle began to cloſe, and numbers of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted animals of various kinds throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the centre, keeping as far as poſſible from the dangers that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached them from all quarters. The huntſmen were now come near enough to reach their game with their arrows; and the prince and his lords ſhot at them as they paſſed and repaſſed, killing and wounding great numbers. <hi>Indur</hi> and his ſurviving companions ſeeing no other means of eſcape, reſolved to make a bold puſh towards that part of the ring which was the moſt weakly guarded; and though many periſhed in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0191002602:10"/>
yet a few, leaping over the heads of the people, got clear away; and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur</hi> was among the number. But whilſt he was ſcouring over the plain, rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his good fortune and conduct, an enemy ſwifter than himſelf overtook him. This was a falcon, who, let looſe by one of the huntſmen, daſhed like lightning after the fugitives; and alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the head of <hi>Indur,</hi> began to tear his eyes with his beak, and flap his wings over his face. <hi>Indur,</hi> terrified and blinded, knew not which way he went; and inſtead of proceeding ſtraight forwards, turned round and came again towards the hunters. One of theſe, riding full ſpeed with a javelin in his hand, came up to him, and ran the weapon in his ſide. He fell down, and with repeated wounds was ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched.</p>
               <p>When the ſtruggle of death was over, <hi>Indur</hi> was equally ſurpriſed and pleaſed on finding himſelf ſoaring high in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0191002602:11"/>
air, as one of a flight of <hi>Wild-Geeſe,</hi> in their annual migration to breed in the arctic regions. With vaſt delight he ſprung forward on eaſy wing through the immenſe fields of air, and ſurveyed beneath him extenſive tracts of earth, perpetually varying with plains, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, rivers, lakes, and woods. At the approach of night, the flock lighted on the ground, and fed on the green corn or graſs; and at day-break they were again on wing, arranged in a regular wedge-like body, with an experienced leader at their head. Thus for many days they continued their journey, paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over countries inhabited by various nations, till at length they arrived in the remoteſt part of Lapland, and ſettled in a wide marſhy lake, filled with numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reedy iſlands, and ſurrounded on all ſides with dark foreſts of pine and birch. Here, in perfect ſecurity from man and hurtful animals, they followed the great buſineſs of breeding and providing for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0191002602:12"/>
their young, living plentifully upon the inſects and aquatic reptiles that abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this ſheltered ſpot. <hi>Indur</hi> with great pleaſure exerciſed his various pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of ſwimming, diving, and flying; ſailing round the iſlands, penetrating into every creek and bay, and viſiting the deepeſt receſſes of the woods. He ſurveyed with aſtoniſhment the ſun, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of riſing and ſetting, making a complete circle in the heavens, and cheering the earth with a perpetual day. Here he met with innumerable tribes of kindred birds, varying in ſize, plumage, and voice, but all paſſing their time in a ſimilar manner, and furniſhed with the ſame powers for providing food and a ſafe retreat for themſelves and their young. The whole lake was covered with parties fiſhing or ſporting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded with their loud cries; while the iſlands were filled with their neſts, and new broods of young were continually coming forth and launching upon the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0191002602:13"/>
ſurface of the waters. One day, <hi>Indur</hi>'s curioſity having led him at a diſtance from his companions to the woody bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the lake, he was near paying dear for his heedleſſneſs; for a fox, that lay in wait among the buſhes, ſprung upon him, and it was with the utmoſt difficulty that by a ſtrong exertion he broke from his hold, not without the loſs of ſome feathers.</p>
               <p>Summer now drawing to an end, the vaſt congregation of water-fowl began to break up; and large bodies of them daily took their way ſouthwards, to paſs the winter in climates where the waters are never ſo frozen as to become unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable by the feathered race. The wild-geeſe to whom <hi>Indur</hi> belonged, proceeded with their young ones by long daily journies acroſs Sweden, the Baltic ſea, Poland, and Turkey, to Leſſer Aſia, and finiſhed their journey at the celebrated plains on the banks of the Cayſter, a noted reſort for their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

ever ſince the age of Homer, who in ſome very beautiful verſes has deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the manners and actions of the various tribes of aquatic birds in that favourite ſpot<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. Here they ſoon recruited from the fatigue of their march, and enjoyed themſelves in the delicious climate till winter. This ſeaſon, though here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely mild, yet making the means of ſuſtenance ſomewhat ſcarce, they were obliged to make foraging excurſions to the cultivated lands in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Having committed great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations upon a fine field of young wheat, the owner ſpread a net on the ground, in which <hi>Indur,</hi> with ſeveral of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0191002602:15"/>
his companions, had the misfortune to be caught. No mercy was ſhown them, but as they were taken out one by one, their necks were all broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indur</hi> was not immediately ſenſible of the next change he underwent, which was into a <hi>Dormouſe,</hi> faſt aſleep in his hole at the foot of a buſh. As it was in a country where the winters are pretty ſevere, he did not wake for ſome weeks; when a thaw having taken place, and the ſun beginning to warm the earth, he unrolled himſelf one day, ſtretched, opened his eyes, and not being able to make out where he was, he rouſed a female companion whom he found by his ſide. When ſhe was ſufficiently awakened, and they both began to feel hungry, ſhe led the way to a magazine of nuts and acorns, where they made a comfortable meal, and ſoon fell aſleep again. This nap having laſted a few days, they awaked a ſecond time, and having eaten, they ventured to crawl to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0191002602:16"/>
the mouth of their hole, where, pulling away ſome withered graſs and leaves, they peeped out into the open air. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking a turn or two in the ſun, they grew chill, and went down again, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up the entrance after them. The cold weather returning, they took an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other long nap, till at length, ſpring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fairly ſet in, they rouſed in earneſt, and began to make daily excurſions abroad. Their winter ſtock of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being now exhauſted, they were for ſome time reduced to great ſtraits, and obliged to dig for roots and pig-nuts. Their fare was mended as the ſeaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and they made a neſt near the bottom of a tree, where they brought up a young family. They never rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far from home, nor aſcended the higher branches of the tree, and paſſed great part of their time in ſleep, even during the midſt of ſummer. When autumn came, they were buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in collecting the nuts, acorns,

and other dry fruits that fell from the trees, and laying them up in their ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe under ground. One day, as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur</hi> was cloſely engaged in this occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, at ſome diſtance from his dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was ſeized by a wild cat, who after tormenting him for a time, gave him a gripe, and put him out of his pain.</p>
               <p>From one of the ſmalleſt and moſt defenceleſs of animals, <hi>Indur</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſtantly changed into a majeſtic <hi>Elephant</hi> in a lofty foreſt of the iſle of Ceylon. Elated with this wonderful advancement in the ſcale of creation, he ſtalked along with conſcious dignity, and ſurveyed with pleaſing wonder his own form and that of his companions, together with the rich ſcenery of the ever-verdant woods, which perfumed the air with their ſpicy odour, and lifted their tall heads to the clouds. Here, fearing no injury, and not deſiring to do any, the gigantic herd roamed at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0191002602:18"/>
large, feeding on the green branches which they tore down with their trunks, bathing in deep rivers during the heat of the day, and repoſing in the depths of the foreſts, reclined againſt the maſſy trunks of trees by night. It was long before <hi>Indur</hi> met with any adventure that could lead him to doubt his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. But one day, having penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a cloſe entangled thicket, he eſpied, lurking under the thick covert, a grim tyger, whoſe eyes flaſhed rage and fury. Though the tyger was one of the largeſt of his ſpecies, yet his bulk was trifling compared to that of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, a ſingle foot of which ſeemed ſufficient to cruſh him; yet the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cruelty of his looks, his angry growl, and grinning teeth, ſtruck ſome terror into <hi>Indur.</hi> There was little time, however, for reflection; for when <hi>Indur</hi> had advanced a ſingle ſtep, the tyger ſetting up a roar, ſprung to meet him, attempting to ſeize his lifted trunk. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0191002602:19"/>
was dexterous enough to receive him upon one of his tuſks, and exerting all his ſtrength, threw the tyger to a great diſtance. He was ſomewhat ſtunned by the fall, but recovering, renewed the aſſault with redoubled fury. <hi>Indur</hi> again, and a third time, threw him off; after which the tyger turning about, bounded away into the midſt of the thicket. <hi>Indur</hi> drew back, and rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his companions, with ſome abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the confidence he had placed in his ſize and ſtrength, which had not prevented him from undergoing ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an attack.</p>
               <p>Soon after, he joined the reſt of the herd in an expedition beyond the bounds of the foreſt, to make depredations on ſome fields of maize. They committed great havock, devouring part, but tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and trampling down much more; when the inhabitants taking the alarm, aſſembled in great numbers, and with fierce ſhouts and flaming brands drove
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0191002602:20"/>
them back to the woods. Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this, they were reſolved to make them pay for the miſchief they had done by taking ſome priſoners. For this purpoſe, they encloſed a large ſpace among the trees with ſtrong poſts and ſtakes, bringing it to a narrower and narrower compaſs, and ending at laſt in a paſſage only capable of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one elephant at a time. This was divided by ſtrong croſs-bars which would lift up and down, into ſeveral apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They then ſent out ſome tame female elephants, bred to the buſineſs, who approaching the herd of wild ones, inveigled the males to follow them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the incloſures. <hi>Indur</hi> was among the firſt who was decoyed by their arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and with ſome others following heedleſsly, he got into the narroweſt part of the incloſure, oppoſite to the paſſage. Here they ſtood awhile, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they ſhould go further. But the females leading the way, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0191002602:21"/>
the cry of invitation, they ventured at length to follow. When a ſufficient number was in the paſſage, the bars were let down by men placed for the purpoſe, and the elephants were fairly caught in a trap. As ſoon as they were ſenſible of their ſituation, they ſell into a fit of rage, and with all their efforts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to break through. But the hunters, throwing nooſes over them, bound them faſt with ſtrong ropes and chains to the poſts on each ſide, and thus kept them without food or ſleep for three days; when, being exhauſted with hunger and fatigue, they gave ſigns of ſufficient tameneſs. They were now let out one by one, and bound each of them to two large tame elephants with riders on their backs, and thus without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance were led away cloſe priſoners. They were then put into ſeparate ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and by proper diſcipline were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently rendered quite tame and gentle.</p>
               <p>Not long after, <hi>Indur,</hi> with five more,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0191002602:22"/>
was ſent over from Ceylon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of India, and ſold to one of the princes of the country. He was now trained to all the ſervices elephants are there employed in; which were, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſons on his back in a kind of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan or litter, to draw cannon, ſhips, and other great weights, to kneel and riſe at command, make obeiſance to his lord, and perform all the motions and attitudes he was ordered. Thus he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a long time, well fed and careſſed, clothed in coſtly trappings on days of ceremony, and contributing to the pomp of eaſtern royalty. At length a war broke out, and <hi>Indur</hi> came to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a different ſcene. After pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per training, he was marched, with a number of his fellows, into the field, bearing on his back a ſmall wooden tower, in which were placed ſome ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with a ſmall field-piece. They ſoon came in ſight of the enemy, and both ſides were drawn up for battle.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0191002602:23"/>
                  <hi>Indur</hi> and the reſt were urged forwards by their leaders, wondering at the ſame time at the ſcene in which they were engaged, ſo contrary to their nature and manners. Preſently all was involved in ſmoke and fire. The elephants ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, ſoon put to flight thoſe who were drawn up before them; but their career was ſtopped by a battery of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which played furiouſly againſt them. their vaſt bodies offered a fair mark to the balls, which preſently ſtruck down ſome, and wounded others. <hi>Indur</hi> received a ſhot on one of his tuſks, which broke it, and put him to ſuch pain and affright, that turning about, he ran with all ſpeed over the plain; and falling in with a body of their own infantry, he burſt through, trampling down whole ranks, and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with terror and confuſion. His leader having now loſt all command over him, and finding him hurtful only to his own party, applied the ſharp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0191002602:24"/>
he carried, to the nape of his neck, and driving it in with all his force, pierced his ſpinal marrow, ſo that he fell lifeleſs to the ground.</p>
               <p>In the next ſtage of his exiſtence, <hi>Indur</hi> to his great ſurpriſe found even the vaſt bulk of the elephant prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly exceeded; for he was now a <hi>Whale</hi> of the largeſt ſpecies, rolling in the midſt of the arctic ſeas. As he darted along, the laſh of his tail made whirlpools in the mighty deep. When he opened his immenſe jaws, he drew in a flood of brine, which, on riſing to the ſurface, he ſpouted out again in a ruſhing foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that roſe high in the air with the noiſe of a mighty cataract. All the other inhabitants of the ocean ſeemed as nothing to him. He ſwallowed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without knowing it, whole ſhoals of the ſmaller kinds; and the larger ſwiftly turned aſide at his approach. <q rend="inline">"Now,"</q> he cried to himſelf, <q rend="inline">"what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other evils may await me, I am
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0191002602:25"/>
certainly ſecure from the moleſtations of other animals; for what is the creature that can dare to cope with me, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his ſtrength with mine?</q> Having ſaid this, he ſaw ſwimming near him a fiſh not a quarter of his length, armed with a dreadful row of teeth. This was a grampus, which directly flying upon <hi>Indur,</hi> faſtened on him, and made his great teeth meet in his fleſh. <hi>Indur</hi> roared with pain, and laſhed the ſea till it was all in a foam; but could neither reach nor ſhake off his cruel foe. He rolled over and over, roſe and ſunk, and exerted all his boaſted ſtrength; but to no purpoſe. At length the grampus quitted his hold, and left him not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mortified with the adventure. This was however forgotten, and <hi>Indur</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived pleaſure from his new ſituation, as he roamed through the boundleſs fields of ocean, now diving to its very bottom, now ſhooting ſwiftly to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and ſporting with his companions
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0191002602:26"/>
in unwieldy gambols. Having choſen a mate, he took his courſe with her ſouthwards, and in due time brought up two young ones, of whom he was extremely fond. The ſummer ſeaſon being arrived, he more frequently than uſual roſe to the ſurface, and baſking in the ſun-beams, floated unmoved with a large part of his huge body above the waves. As he was thus one day enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a profound ſleep, he was awakened by a ſharp inſtrument penetrating deep into his back. Inſtantly he ſprung away with the ſwiftneſs of lightning, and feeling the weapon ſtill ſticking, he dived into the receſſes of the deep, and ſtaid there till want of air obliged him to aſcend to the ſurface. Here another harpoon was plunged into him, the ſmart of which again made him fly from his unſeen foes; but after a ſhorter courſe, he was again compelled to riſe, much weakened by the loſs of blood, which guſhing in a torrent, tinged the waters
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0191002602:27"/>
as he paſſed. Another wound was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, which ſoon brought him almoſt lifeleſs to the ſurface; and the line faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to the firſt harpoon being now pulled in, this enormous creature was brought, an unreſiſting prey, to the ſide of a ſhip, where he was ſoon quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, and then cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>The ſoul of this huge carcaſe had next a much narrower lodging, for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur</hi> was changed into a <hi>Bee,</hi> which, with a great multitude of its young compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, was on flight in ſearch of a new ſettlement, their parents having driven them out of the hive, which was unable to contain them all. After a rambling excurſion, the queen, by whom all their motions were directed, ſettled on the branch of a lofty tree. They all imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cluſtered round her, and ſoon formed a large black bunch, depending from the bough. A man preſently planting a ladder aſcended with a bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hive, and ſwept them in. After they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0191002602:28"/>
were quietly ſettled in their new habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were placed on a ſtand in the garden along with ſome other colonies, and left to begin their labours. Every fine morning, as ſoon as the ſun was up, the greateſt part of them ſallied forth, and roamed over the garden and the neighbouring fields in ſearch of freſh and fragrant flowers. They firſt col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a quantity of gluey matter, with which they lined all the inſide of their houſe. Then they brought wax, and began to make their cells, building them with the utmoſt regularity, though it was their firſt attempt, and they had no teacher. As faſt as they were built, ſome were filled with liquid honey ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the nectaries of flowers; and as they filled the cells, they ſealed them up with a thin covering of wax. In other cells, the queen bee depoſited her eggs, which were to ſupply a new progeny for the enſuing year. Nothing could be a more pleaſing ſight, than to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0191002602:29"/>
behold on a ſunſhiny day the inſects continually going forth to their labour, while others were as conſtantly arriving at the mouth of the hole, either with yellow balls of wax under their thighs, or full of the honey which they had drawn in with their trunks, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſpouting it out into the cells of the honey-comb. <hi>Indur</hi> felt much delight in this uſeful and active way of life, and was always one of the firſt abroad at the dawn, and lateſt home in the evening. On rainy and foggy days they ſtaid at home, and employed themſelves in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing their cells, and all the neceſſary work within doors; and <hi>Indur,</hi> though endued with human reaſon, could not but admire the readineſs with which he and the reſt formed the moſt regular plans of work, all correſponding in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and execution, guided by inſtinct alone.</p>
               <p>The end of autumn now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the bees had filled their combs with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0191002602:30"/>
honey; and nothing more being to be got abroad, they ſtaid within doors, paſſing moſt of their time in ſleep. They eat a little of their ſtore, but with great frugality; and all their meals were made in public, none daring to make free with the common ſtock by himſelf. The owner of the hives now came and took them one by one into his hands, that he might judge by the weight whether or no they were full of honey. That in which <hi>Indur</hi> was, proved to be one of the heavieſt; and it was therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take the contents. For this purpoſe, one cold night, when the bees were all faſt aſleep, the hive was placed over a hole in the ground, in which were put brimſtone matches ſet on fire. The fumes roſe into the hive, and ſoon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated great part of the bees, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified the reſt, ſo that they all fell from the combs. <hi>Indur</hi> was amongſt the dead.</p>
               <p>He ſoon revived in the form of a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0191002602:31"/>
young <hi>Rabbit</hi> in a ſpacious warren. This was like a populous town; being every where hollowed by burrows run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deep under ground, and each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by one or more families. In the evening, the warren was covered with a vaſt number of rabbits, old and young, ſome feeding, others friſking about, and purſuing one another in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſport. At the leaſt alarm, they all hurried into the holes neareſt them; and were in an inſtant ſafe from enemies, who either could not follow them at all, or if they did, were foiled in the chaſe by the numerous ways and turnings in the earth, communicating with each other, ſo as to afford eaſy means of eſcape. <hi>Indur</hi> delighted much in this ſecure and ſocial life; and taking a mate, was ſoon the father of a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offspring. Several of the little ones, however, not being ſufficiently careful, fell a prey either to hawks and crows continually hovering over the warren,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0191002602:32"/>
or to cats, foxes, and other wild qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds, who uſed every art to catch them at a diſtance from their holes. <hi>Indur</hi> himſelf ran ſeveral hazards. He was once very near being caught by a little dog trained for the purpoſe, who kept playing round for a conſiderable time, not ſeeming to attend to the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, till having got near, he all at once darted into the midſt of them. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time he received ſome ſhot from a ſportſman who lay on the watch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a hedge adjoining the warren.</p>
               <p>The number of rabbits here was ſo great, that a hard winter coming on, which killed moſt of the vegetables, or buried them deep under the ſnow, they were reduced to great ſtraits, and many were famiſhed to death. Some turnips and hay, however, which were laid for them, preſerved the greater part. The approach of ſpring renewed their ſport and pleaſure; and <hi>Indur</hi> was made the father of another family. One night,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0191002602:33"/>
however, was fatal to them all. As they were ſleeping, they were alarmed by the attack of a ferret; and running with great ſpeed to the mouth of their burrow to eſcape it, they were all caught in nets placed over the holes. <hi>Indur</hi> with the reſt was diſpatched by a blow on the back of the neck, and his body was ſent to the neareſt market town.</p>
               <p>His next change was into a young <hi>Maſtiff,</hi> brought up in a farm yard. Having nearly acquired his full ſize, he was ſent as a preſent to a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who wanted a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful guard for his houſe and grounds. <hi>Indur</hi> preſently attached himſelf to his maſter and all his family, and ſhowed every mark of a noble and generous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Though fierce as a lion when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thought the perſons or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of his friends invaded, he was as gentle as a lamb at other times, and would patiently ſuffer any kind of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms from thoſe he loved. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0191002602:34"/>
the children of the houſe to lug him about, ride on his back, and uſe him as roughly as their little hands were capable of; never, even when hurt, ſhewing his diſpleaſure further than by a low growl. He was extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to all the other animals of his ſpecies in the yard; and when abroad, would treat the impertinent barking of little dogs with ſilent contempt. Once, indeed, being provoked beyond bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not only by the noiſe, but by the ſnaps, of a malicious whelp, he ſuddenly ſeized him in his open mouth; but when the byſtanders thought that the poor cur was going inſtantly to be devoured, they were equally diverted and pleaſed at ſeeing <hi>Indur</hi> go to the ſide of a muddy ditch, and drop his antagoniſt, unhurt into the middle of it.</p>
               <p>He had, however, more ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts frequently to ſuſtain. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to attend the ſervant on mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket days to the neighbouring town;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0191002602:35"/>
when it was his office to guard the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion cart, while the man was making his purchaſes in the ſhops. On theſe occaſions, the boldeſt dogs in the ſtreet would ſometimes make an onſet in a body; and while ſome of them were engaging <hi>Indur,</hi> others would be mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cart, and pulling down the meat baſkets. <hi>Indur</hi> had much ado to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf and the baggage too; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he never failed to make ſome of the aſſailants pay dearly for their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and by his loud barking, he ſummoned his human fellow-ſervant to his aſſiſtance, in time to prevent their depredations.</p>
               <p>At length his courage was exerted on the moſt important ſervice to which it could be applied. His maſter, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home late one evening, was attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near his own houſe by three armed ruffians. <hi>Indur</hi> heard his voice calling for help, and inſtantly flew to his relief. He ſeized one of the villains by the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0191002602:36"/>
throat, brought him to the ground, and preſently diſabled him. The maſter, in the mean time, was keeping off the other two with a large ſtick; but had received ſeveral wounds with a cutlaſs; and one of the men had preſented a piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, and was juſt on the point of firing. At this moment <hi>Indur,</hi> leaving his van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed foe on the ground, ruſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſeizing the man's arm, made him drop the piſtol. The maſter took it up; on which the other robber fled. He now advanced to him with whom <hi>Indur</hi> was engaged, and fired the piſtol at him. The ball broke the man's arm, and from thence entered the body of <hi>Indur,</hi> and mortally wounded him. He fell, but had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing his maſter remain lord of the field; and the ſervants now coming up, made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of the two wounded robbers. The maſter threw himſelf by the ſide of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur,</hi> and expreſſed the warmeſt concern at the accident which had made him the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0191002602:37"/>
cauſe of the death of the faithful animal that had preſerved his life. <hi>Indur</hi> died, licking his hand.</p>
               <p>So generous a nature was now no longer to be annexed to a brutal form. <hi>Indur,</hi> awaking as it were from a trance, found himſelf again in the happy region he had formerly inhabited, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced the innocent life of a Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. He cheriſhed the memory of his tranſmigrations, and handed them down to poſterity, in a relation, from whence the preceding account has been extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the amuſement of my young readers.</p>

they were able with neceſſaries for the journey. I ſhall never forget the tenderneſs with which they parted with me. It was, if poſſible, beyond that of the kindeſt parents.

Though it is now fifteen years ſince my departure, I feel my affection for theſe good folks ſtronger than ever, and could not be eaſy without taking the firſt opportunity of ſeeing them.</p>

                  <speaker>George.</speaker>
                  <p>Why it is corn—don't you ſee it is in ear?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—but it ſeems too ſhort for corn; and the corn we juſt now paſſed is not in ear by a great deal.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I don't know what it is. Pray, Sir, will you tell us?</p>

                  <speaker>Tutor.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't wonder you were puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled about it. It is a ſort of graſs ſown for hay, and is called <hi>rye-graſs.</hi>

                  <p>There is no great wonder in that; for all corn is really a kind of graſs. And on the other hand, if you were a Liliputian, every ſpecies of graſs would appear to you amazing large corn.</p>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Then there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween corn and graſs but the ſize?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>None at all.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>But we eat corn; and graſs is not good to eat.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>It is only the ſeeds of corn that we eat. We leave the ſtalks and leaves for cows and horſes. Now we might eat the ſeeds of graſs, if they were big enough to be worth gathering; and ſome particular kinds are in fact eaten in certain countries.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>But is wheat and barley really graſs?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—they are ſpecies of that great family of plants, which botaniſts call <hi>graſſes;</hi> and I will take this opportunity of telling you ſomething about them. Go, George, and pull us up a root of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0191002602:66"/>
that rye-graſs. Harry and I will ſit down on this ſtile till you come to us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Here is graſs enough all round us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then—pull up a few roots that you ſee in ear.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Here is the graſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>And here is mine.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Well—ſpread them all in a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief before us. Now look at the roots of them all. What do you call them?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I think they are what you have told us are <hi>fibrous</hi> roots.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Right—they conſiſt of a bundle of ſtrings. Then look at their ſtalks—you will find them jointed and hollow, like the ſtraw of corn.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>So they are.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>The leaves, you ſee, of all the kinds are very long and narrow, taper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a point at their ends. Thoſe of corn, you know, are the ſame.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—they are ſo like graſs at
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0191002602:67"/>
firſt, that I can never tell the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Next obſerve the ears, or heads. Some of theſe, you ſee, are thick and cloſe, exactly like thoſe of wheat or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; others are more looſe and open, like oats. The firſt are generally called <hi>ſpikes;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>panicles.</hi> If you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them cloſely, you will find that they all conſiſt of a number of diſtinct huſky bodies, which are properly the flowers; each of which is ſucceeded by a ſingle ſeed. I dare ſay you have picked ears of wheat.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh yes—I am very fond of them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then—you found that the grains all lay ſingle, contained in a ſcaly huſk, making a part of the ear, or head. Before the ſeed was formed, there was a flower in its place. I do not mean a gay fine-coloured flower, but a few ſcales, with threads coming out among them, each crowned with a white tip. And
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0191002602:68"/>
ſoon after the ears of corn appear, you will find their flowers open, and theſe white tips coming out of them. This is the ſtructure of the flowers and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering heads of every one of the graſs tribe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>But what are the <hi>beards</hi> of corn?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>The beards are briſtles or points running out from the ends of the huſks. They are properly called <hi>awns.</hi> Moſt of the graſs tribe have ſomething of theſe, but they are much longer in ſome kinds than in others. In barley, you know, they are very long, and give the whole field a ſort of downy or ſilky ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, eſpecially when waved by the wind.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Are there the ſame kinds of corn and graſs in all countries?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>No. With reſpect to corn, that is in all countries the product of cultivation; and different ſorts are found beſt to ſuit different climates. Thus in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of the temperate zone, oats
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0191002602:69"/>
and rye are chiefly grown. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and ſouthern, barley and wheat. Wheat is univerſally the ſpecies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred for bread-corn; but there are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds of it, differing from each other in ſize of grain, firmneſs, colour, and other qualities.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Does not the beſt wheat of all grow in England?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>By no means. Wheat is better ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the warmer climates, and it is only by great attention and upon particular ſoils that it is made to ſucceed well here. On the other hand, the torrid zone is too hot for wheat and our other grains; and they chiefly cultivate rice there, and Indian corn.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I have ſeen heads of Indian corn, as thick as my wriſt. But they do not look at all like our corn.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—the ſeeds all grow ſingle in a ſort of chaffy head; and the ſtalk and leaves reſemble thoſe of the graſs tribe, but of a gigantic ſize. But there are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0191002602:70"/>
other plants of this family, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you have not thought of.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>What are they?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Canes and reeds—from the ſugar-cane and bamboo of the tropics, to the common reed of our ditches, of which you make arrows. All theſe have the general character of the graſſes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>I know that reeds have very fine feathery heads, like the tops of graſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>They have ſo. And the ſtalks are compoſed of many joints; as are alſo thoſe of the ſugar-cane, and the bamboo, of which fiſhing rods and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſticks are often made. Some of theſe are very tall plants, but the ſeeds of them are ſmall in proportion, and not uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for food. But there is yet another kind of graſs-like plants common among us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>What is that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Have you not obſerved in the marſhes, and on the ſides of ditches, a coarſe broader leaved ſort of graſs, with large dark-coloured ſpikes? This is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0191002602:71"/>
                     <hi>ſedge,</hi> in Latin <hi>carex,</hi> and there are many ſorts of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>What is that good for?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>It is eaten by cattle, both freſh and dry; but is inferior in quality to good graſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>What is it that makes one kind of graſs better than another?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>There are various properties which give value to graſſes. Some ſpread more than others, reſiſt froſt and drought better; yield a greater crop of leaves, and are therefore better for paſturage and hay. The juices of ſome are more nouriſhing and ſweeter than others. In general, however, different graſſes are ſuited to different ſoils; and by improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoils, the quality of the graſs is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Does graſs grow in all countries?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—the green turf which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally covers fertile ſoil in all countries, is chiefly compoſed of graſſes of various kinds. They form, therefore, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0191002602:72"/>
carpet extended over the earth; and humble as they are, they contribute more to beauty and utility, than any other part of the vegetable creation.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>What—more than trees?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, certainly. A land entirely covered with trees would be gloomy, unwholeſome, and ſcarcely inhabitable; whereas the meadow, the down, and the corn field, afford the moſt agreeable proſpects to the eye, and furniſh every neceſſary, and many of the luxuries of life. Give us corn and graſs, and what ſhall we want for food?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me ſee—what ſhould we have? There's bread, and flour for pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, and milk, for you know cows live on graſs and hay—ſo there's cheeſe and butter, and all things that are made of milk.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T.</speaker>
                  <p>And are there not all kinds of meat too, and poultry? And then for drink, there is beer and ale, which are

made from barley. For all theſe we are chiefly indebted to <hi>the graſſes.</hi>

                  <p>O—there are many things in common life that belong to the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of ſciences. Making tea is the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical operation called <hi>infuſion,</hi> which is, when a hot liquor is poured upon a ſubſtance in order to extract ſomething from it. The water, you ſee, extracts from the tea-leaves their colour, taſte, and flavour.</p>

                  <p>It would, but more ſlowly. Heat aſſiſts almoſt all liquors in their power of extracting the virtues of herbs and other ſubſtances. Thus good houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives were formerly uſed to boil their tea, in order to get all the goodneſs from it as completely as poſſible. The greater heat and agitation of boiling makes it act more powerfully. The
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0191002602:75"/>
liquor in which a ſubſtance has been boiled is called a <hi>decoction</hi> of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

                     <hi>Solution</hi> is when a ſolid put into a fluid entirely diſappears in it, leaving the liquor clear.

                  <p>It would. But if I were to throw in a lump of chalk, it would lie undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at the bottom.</p>

                  <p>True, while it was ſtirred; and then it would be a <hi>diffuſion.</hi> But while the chalk was thus mixed with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, it would loſe its tranſparency, and not recover it again, till by ſtanding the chalk had all ſubſided, and left the liquor as it was before.</p>

                  <p>Why, that is only <hi>diffuſed,</hi> for it takes away the tranſparency of the tea.

                  <p>The ſugar and ſalt would melt and diſappear. The tea-leaves would yield their colour and taſte. The chalk—I do not know what would become of that.</p>

                  <speaker>Tut.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, if the mixture were ſtirred, the chalk would be diffuſed through it, and make it <hi>turbid</hi> or muddy; but on ſtanding, it would leave it unchanged.</p>

                  <speaker>Tut.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes. The clear liquor would contain in <hi>ſolution</hi> ſalt, ſugar, and thoſe particles of the tea, in which its colour and taſte conſiſted: the remainder of the tea, and the chalk, would lie undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>

                  <speaker>Pup.</speaker>

                  <p>Undoubtedly. If taken out and dried they would be found to have loſt

part of their weight, and the water would have gained it. Sometimes, however, it is an extremely ſmall portion of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is ſoluble, but it is that in which its moſt remarkable qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. Thus a ſmall piece of ſpice will communicate a ſtrong flavour to a large quantity of liquid, with very little loſs of weight.</p>

                  <p>By no means. Many diſſolve in water, that will not in ſpirit of wine; and the contrary. And upon this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference many curious matters in the arts are founded. Thus, ſpirit varniſh is made of a ſolution of various gums or reſins in ſpirits that will not diſſolve in water. Therefore, when it has been laid over any ſurface with a bruſh, and is become dry, the rain or moiſture of the air will not affect it. This is the caſe with the beautiful varniſh laid upon coaches. On the other hand, the

varniſh leſt by gum-water could not be waſhed off by ſpirits.</p>

                  <speaker>Pup.</speaker>
                  <p>I remember when I made gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, upon ſetting the cup in a warm place, it all dried away, and left the gum juſt as it was before. Would the ſame happen if I had ſugar or ſalt diſſolved in water?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Yes—upon expoſing the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to warmth, it would dry away, and you would get back your ſalt or ſugar in a ſolid ſtate as before.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pup.</speaker>
                  <p>But if I were to do ſo with a cup of tea, what ſhould I get?</p>

                  <speaker>Tut.</speaker>
                  <p>Not tea-leaves, certainly! But your queſtion requires a little previous explanation. It is the property of heat to make moſt things fly off in vapour, which is called <hi>evaporation</hi> or <hi>exhalation.</hi> But this it does in very different degrees to different ſubſtances. Some are very eaſily made to <hi>evaporate;</hi> others very difficultly; and others not at all by the moſt violent fire we can raiſe. Fluids,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0191002602:80"/>
in general, are eaſily <hi>evaporable;</hi> but not equally ſo. Spirits of wine fly off in vapour much ſooner than water; ſo that if you had a mixture of the two, by applying a gentle heat you might drive off all the ſpirits, and leave the water pure. Water, again, is more evaporable than oil. Some ſolid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are much diſpoſed to evaporate. Thus, ſmelling ſalts by a little heat may be entirely driven away in the air. But in general, ſolids are more <hi>fixed</hi> than fluids; and therefore when a ſolid is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in a fluid, it may commonly be recovered again by evaporation. By this operation common ſalt is got from ſea-water and ſalt ſprings, both artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and in hot countries by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat of the ſun. When the water is no more than is juſt ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the ſalt, it is called a <hi>ſaturated ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> and on evaporating the water fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſalt begins to ſeparate, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little regular maſſes called <hi>cryſtals.</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0191002602:81"/>
Sugar may be made in like manner to form cryſtals, and then it is ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candy.</p>

               <sp>

                  <speaker>Tut.</speaker>
                  <p>That is, when ſo much ſugar is diſſolved as ſenſibly to thicken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, but not to ſeparate from it. Well—now to your queſtion about tea. On expoſing it to conſiderable heat, thoſe fine particles in which its flavour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, being as <hi>volatile</hi> or evaporable as the water, would fly off along with it; and when the liquor came to dryneſs, there would only be left thoſe particles in which its roughneſs and colour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. This would make what is called an <hi>extract</hi> of a plant.</p>

                  <p>It aſcends into the air, and unites with it. But if in its way it be ſtopped by any cold body, it is <hi>condenſed,</hi> that is, it returns to the ſtate of water again. Lift up the lid of the tea-pot, and you
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0191002602:82"/>
will ſee water collected on the inſide of it, which is condenſed ſteam from the hot tea beneath. Hold a ſpoon or knife in the way of the ſteam which burſts out from the ſpout of the tea-kettle, and you will find it immediately covered with drops. This operation of turning a fluid into vapour, and then condenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is called <hi>diſtillation.</hi> For this purpoſe, the veſſel in which the liquor is heated is cloſely covered with another called the head, into which the ſteam riſes, and is condenſed. It is then drawn off by means of a pipe into another veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel called the receiver. In this way all ſweet ſcented and aromatic liquors are drawn from fragrant vegetables, by means of water or ſpirits. The fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant part, being very volatile, riſes along with the ſteam of the water or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and remains united with it after it is condenſed. Roſe-water and ſpirit of lavender are liquors of this kind.</p>

                  <p>Yes. That is an old diſcovery lately revived. The ſalt in ſea-water, being of a fixed nature, does not riſe with the ſteam; and therefore, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſing the ſteam, the water is found to be freſh. And this indeed is the method nature employs in raiſing water by exhalation from the ocean, which collecting into clouds, is condenſed in the cold regions of the air, and falls down in rain.</p>

                  <p>I remember Capt. Cook brought over ſomebody from Otaheite; and poor Lee Boo was brought here from the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew Iſlands. But I believe they both came of their own accord.</p>

                  <p>They did. And it is a great proof of the better way of thinking of modern voyagers than of former ones, that they do not conſider it as juſtifiable to uſe violence even for the ſuppoſed benefit of the people they viſit.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0191002602:90"/>
as for the pleaſantneſs of a place, that all depends upon habit. The Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander, being accuſtomed to the way of living, and all the objects, of his own country, could not reliſh any other ſo well. He loved whale-fat and ſeal as well as you can do pudding and beef. He thought rowing his little boat amid the boiſterous waves, finer diverſion than driving a plough or a cart. He fenced againſt the winter's cold by warm cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the long night of many weeks, which you would think ſo gloomy, was to him a ſeaſon of eaſe and feſtivity in his habitation under ground. It is a very kind and wiſe diſpenſation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that every part of the world is rendered the moſt agreeable to thoſe who live in it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>June 10th.</hi> Laſt night we had a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alarm. A violent ſcream was heard from the hen-rooſt; the geeſe all ſet up a cackle, and the dogs barked. Ned, the boy who lies over the ſtable, jumped up and ran into the yard, when he obſerved a fox gallopping away with a chicken in his mouth, and the dogs in full chaſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. They could not overtake him, and ſoon returned. Upon further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, the large white cock was found lying on the ground all bloody, with his comb torn almoſt off, and his feathers all ruffled; and the ſpeckled hen and three chickens lay dead beſide him. The cock recovered, but appeared ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly frightened. It ſeems that the fox had jumped over the garden hedge, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0191002602:94"/>
then croſſing part of the yard behind the ſtraw, had crept into the hen-rooſt through a broken pale. John the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter was ſent for, to make all faſt, and prevent the like miſchief again.</p>
                  <p>Early this morning the brindled cow was delivered of a fine bull-calf. Both are likely to do well. The calf is to be fattened for the butcher.</p>
                  <p>The duck-eggs that were ſitten upon by the old balck hen were hatched this day, and the ducklings all directly ran into the pond, to the great terror of the hen, who went round and round, cluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all her might in order to call them out, but they did not regard her. An old drake took the little ones under his care, and they ſwam about very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
                  <p>As Dolly this morning was milking the new cow that was bought at the fair, ſhe kicked with her hind-legs, and threw down the milk-pail, at the ſame time
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0191002602:95"/>
knocking Dolly off her ſtool into the dirt. For this offence the cow was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to have her head faſtened to the rack, and her legs tied together.</p>
                  <p>A kite was obſerved to hover a long while over the yard with an intention of carrying off ſome of the young chickens; but the hens called their broods together under their wings, and the cocks put themſelves in order of battle, ſo that the kite was diſappointed. At length, one chicken, not minding its mother, but ſtraggling heedleſsly to a diſtance, was deſcried by the kite, who made a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſwoop, and ſeized it in his talons.—The chicken cried out, and the cocks and hens all ſcreamed; when Ralph the farmer's ſon, who ſaw the attack, ſnatched up a loaded gun, and juſt as the kite was flying off with his prey, fired and brought him dead to the ground, along with the poor chicken, who was killed in the fall. The dead
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0191002602:96"/>
body of the kite was nailed up againſt the wall, by way of warning to his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed comrades.</p>
                  <p>In the forenoon we were alarmed with ſtrange noiſes approaching us, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out we ſaw a number of people with frying pans, warming pans, tongs and pokers, beating, ringing, and making all poſſible din. We ſoon diſcovered them to be our neighbours of the next farm, in purſuit of a ſwarm of bees which was hovering in the air over their heads. The bees at length alighted on the tall pear-tree in our orchard, and hung in a bunch from one of the boughs. A ladder was got, and a man aſcending with gloves on his hands and an apron tied over his head, ſwept them into a hive which was rubbed on the inſide with honey and ſweet herbs. But as he was deſcending, ſome bees which had got under his gloves ſtung him in ſuch a manner, that he haſtily threw down the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0191002602:97"/>
hive, upon which the greater part of the bees fell out, and began in a rage to fly among the crowd, and ſting all whom they lit upon. Away ſcampered the people, the women ſhrieking, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren roaring; and poor Adam, who had held the hive, was aſſailed ſo furiouſly, that he was obliged to throw himſelf on the ground, and creep under the gooſeberry buſhes. At length, the bees began to return to the hive, in which the queen bee had remained; and after a while, all being quietly ſettled, a cloth was thrown over it, and the ſwarm was carried home.</p>
                  <p>About noon, three pigs broke into the garden, where they were rioting upon the carrots and turnips, and doing a great deal of miſchief by trampling the beds and rooting up the plants with their ſnouts; when they were ſpied by old Towzer the maſtiff, who ran among them, and laying hold of their long ears
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0191002602:98"/>
with his teeth, made them ſqueel moſt diſmally, and get out of the garden as faſt as they could.</p>
                  <p>Roger the plowman, when he came for his dinner, brought word that he had diſcovered a partridge's neſt with ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen eggs in the home field. Upon which the farmer went out and broke them all; ſaying that he did not chooſe to rear birds upon his corn which he was not allowed to catch, but muſt leave to ſome qualified ſportſman, who would beſides break down his fences in the purſuit.</p>
                  <p>A ſheep-waſhing was held this day at the mill-pool, when ſeven ſcore were well waſhed, and then penned in the high meadow to dry. Many of them made great reſiſtance at being thrown into the water; and the old ram, being dragged to the brink by a boy at each horn, and a third puſhing behind, by a ſudden ſpring threw two of them into
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0191002602:99"/>
the water, to the great diverſion of the ſpectators.</p>
                  <p>Towards the duſk of the evening, the 'Squire's mongrel greyhound, which had been long ſuſpected of worrying ſheep, was caught in the fact. He had killed two lambs, and was making a hearty meal upon one of them, when he was diſturbed by the approach of the ſhepherd's boy, and directly leaped the hedge and made off. The dead bodies were taken to the 'Squire's, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment of wilful murder againſt the dog. But when they came to look for the culprit, he was not to be found in any part of the premiſes, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have fled his country through conſciouſneſs of his heinous offence.</p>
                  <p>Joſeph, who ſleeps in the garret at the old end of the houſe, after having been ſome time in bed, came down ſtairs in his ſhirt, as pale as aſhes, and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the maids, who were going up. It
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0191002602:100"/>
was ſome time before he could tell what was the matter: at length he ſaid he had heard ſome dreadful noiſes over head, which he was ſure muſt be made by ſome ghoſt or evil ſpirit; nay, he thought he had ſeen ſomething mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though he owned he durſt hardly lift up his eyes. He concluded with declaring, that he would rather ſit up all night in the kitchen than go to his room again. The maids were almoſt as much alarmed as he, and did not know what to do; but the maſter, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing their talk, came out, and inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their accompanying him to the ſpot, in order to ſearch into the affair. They all went into the garret, and for a while heard nothing; when the maſter ordered the candle to be taken away, and every one to keep quite ſtill. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph and the maids ſtuck cloſe to each other, and trembled every limb. At length a kind of groaning or ſnoring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be heard, which grew louder and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0191002602:101"/>
louder, with intervals of a ſtrange ſort of hiſſing. <q rend="inline">"That's it!"</q> whiſpered Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, drawing back towards the door—the maids were ready to ſink; and even the farmer himſelf was a little diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed. The noiſe ſeemed to come from the rafters near the thatch. In a while, a glimpſe of moon-light ſhining through a hole at the place, plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſhadow of ſomething ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and on looking intently, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like feathers was perceived. The farmer now began to ſuſpect what the caſe was; and ordering up a ſhort ladder, bid Joſeph climb to the ſpot, and thruſt his hand into the hole. This he did rather unwillingly, and ſoon drew it back, crying loudly that he was bit. However, gathering courage, he put it in again, and pulled out a large white owl, another at the ſame time being heard to fly away. The cauſe of the alarm was now made clear enough; and poor Joſeph, after being heartily jeered
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0191002602:102"/>
by the maids, though they had been as much frightened as he, ſneaked into bed again, and the houſe ſoon became quiet.</p>

                  <p>MY dear father, you obſerved the other day that we had a great many <hi>manufactures</hi> in England. Pray what is a Manufacture?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>A Manufacture is ſomething made by the hand of man. It is derived from two Latin words, <hi>manus,</hi> the hand, and <hi>facere,</hi> to make. Manufactures are therefore oppoſed to <hi>productions,</hi> which latter are what the bounty of nature ſpontaneouſly affords us; as fruits, corn, marble.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hen.</speaker>
                  <p>But there is a great deal of trouble with corn: you have often made me take notice how much pains it coſts the farmer
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0191002602:103"/>
to plough his ground, and put the ſeed in the earth, and keep it clear from weeds.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>Very true; but the farmer does not <hi>make</hi> the corn; he only prepares for it a proper ſoil and ſituation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves every hindrance ariſing from the hardneſs of the ground, or the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of other plants, which might obſtruct the ſecret and wonderful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of vegetation; but with the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation itſelf he has nothing to do. It is not <hi>his</hi> hand that draws out the ſlender fibres of the root, puſhes up the green ſtalk, and by degrees the ſpiky ear; ſwells the grain, and embrowns it with that rich tinge of tawny ruſſet, which informs the huſbandman it is time to put in his ſickle: all this operation is performed without his care or even knowledge.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hen.</speaker>
                  <p>Now then I underſtand; corn is a <hi>Production,</hi> and bread a <hi>Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>Bread is certainly, in ſtrictneſs of ſpeech, a Manufacture; but we do not in general apply the term to any thing in which the original material is ſo little changed. If we wanted to ſpeak of bread philoſophically, we ſhould ſay, it is a <hi>preparation</hi> of corn.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hen.</speaker>
                  <p>Is ſugar a Manufacture?</p>

                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>No, for the ſame reaſon. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, I do not recollect the term being applied to any article of food; I ſuppoſe from an idea that food is of too periſhable a nature, and generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a proceſs too ſimple to deſerve the name. We ſay, therefore, ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, oil-mills, chocolate-works; we do not ſay a beer-manufactory, but a brewery; but this is only a nicety of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, for properly all thoſe are manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories, if there is much of art and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in the proceſs.</p>

                  <speaker>Hen.</speaker>
                  <p>Do we ſay a manufactory of <hi>pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>No; but for a different reaſon.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0191002602:105"/>
A picture, eſpecially if it belong to any of the higher kinds of painting, is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of genius. A picture cannot be produced by any given combinations of canvas and colour. It is the hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that executes, but the head that works. Sir Joſhua Reynolds could not have gone, when he was engaged to paint a picture, and hired workmen, the one to draw the eyes, another the noſe, a third the mouth; the whole muſt be the painter's own, that particular painter's, and no other; and no one who has not his ideas can do his work.

                  <p>The making of watches is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture: the ſilver, iron, gold, or whatever elſe is uſed in it, are produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the material of the work; but it is by the wonderful art of man that they are wrought into the numberleſs wheels

                  <speaker>Hen.</speaker>
                  <p>Then is there not as much art in making a watch as a picture? Does not the head work?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly, in the original inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of watches, as much, or more, than in painting; but when once invented, the art of watch-making is capable of being reduced to a mere mechanical la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which may be exerciſed by any man of common capacity, according to certain preciſe rules, when made fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him by practice. This, painting is not.</p>

                  <p>But, my dear father, making of books ſurely requires a great deal of thinking and ſtudy; and yet I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the other day at dinner a gentleman ſaid that Mr. Pica had <hi>manufactured</hi> a large volume in leſs than a fortnight.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>It was meant to convey a ſatirical remark on his book, becauſe it was compiled from other authors, from whom
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0191002602:107"/>
he had taken a page in one place, and a page in another; ſo that it was not produced by the labour of his brain, but of his hands. Thus you heard your mother complain that the London cream was <hi>manufactured;</hi> which was a pointed and conciſe way of ſaying that the cream was not what it ought to be, nor what it pretended to be; for cream, when genuine, is a pure production; but when mixed up and adulterated with flour and iſinglaſs, and I know not what, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Manufacture. It was as much as to ſay, art has been here, where it has no buſineſs; where it is not beneficial, but hurtful. A great deal of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of language depends upon an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate knowledge of the ſpecific mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſingle terms, and a nice attention to their relative propriety.</p>

                  <speaker>Hen.</speaker>
                  <p>Why ſo?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>For the ſame reaſon, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that individuals, who are rich without any labour of their own, are ſeldom ſo induſtrious and active as thoſe who depend upon their own exertions: thus the Spaniards, who poſſeſs the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gold and ſilver mines in the world, are in want of many conveniences of life which are enjoyed in London and Amſterdam.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hen.</speaker>
                  <p>I can comprehend that; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve if my uncle Ledger were to find a gold mine under his warehouſe, he would ſoon ſhut up ſhop.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>I believe ſo. It is not, however, eaſy to eſtabliſh Manufactures in a <hi>very poor</hi> nation; they require ſcience and genius for their invention, art and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance for their execution; order, peace, and union, for their flouriſhing; they require a number of men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0191002602:109"/>
together in an undertaking, and to proſecute it with the moſt patient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; they require, therefore, laws and government for their protection. If you ſee extenſive Manufactures in any nation, you may be ſure it is a civilized nation; you may be ſure property is accurately aſcertained and protected. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire great expences for their firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, coſtly machines for ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manual labour, and money and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit for purchaſing materials from diſtant countries. There is not a ſingle Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of Great Britain which does not require, in ſome part or other of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, productions from the different parts of the globe; oils, drugs, varniſh, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, and the like; it requires, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>ſhips</hi> and a friendly intercourſe with foreign nations to tranſport commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and exchange productions. We could not be a manufacturing, unleſs we were alſo a commercial nation. They require time to take root in any place,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0191002602:110"/>
and their excellence often depends upon ſome nice and delicate circumſtance; a peculiar quality, for inſtance, in the air, or water, or ſome other local circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance not eaſily aſcertained. Thus, I have heard, that the Iriſh women ſpin better than the Engliſh, becauſe the moiſter temperature of their climate makes their ſkin more ſoft and their fingers more flexible: thus again we cannot dye ſo beautiful a ſcarlet as the French can, though with the ſame drugs, perhaps on account of the ſuperior pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their air. But though ſo much is neceſſary for the perfection of the more curious and complicated Manufactures, all nations poſſeſs thoſe which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the common conveniences of life—the loom and the forge, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, are of the higheſt antiquity.</p>

                  <p>Yes. Man is as much ſuperior to the brutes in his outward form, by means of the hand, as he is in his mind by the gifts of reaſon. The trunk of the elephant comes perhaps the neareſt to it in its exquiſite feeling and flexibility (it is, indeed, called his hand in Latin), and accordingly that animal has always been reckoned the wiſeſt of brutes. When Nature gave man the hand, ſhe ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"Exerciſe your ingenuity, and work."</q> As ſoon as ever man riſes

the labour of man, by performing it in leſs time, or to perform what the ſtrength of man alone could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh:—the other in fuſing and working ores, in dying and bleaching, and extracting the virtues of various ſubſtances for particular uſes: making of ſoap, for inſtance, is a chemical operation; and by chemiſtry an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious gentleman has lately found out a way of bleaching a piece of cloth in eight and forty hours, which by the common proceſs would have taken up a great many weeks.—You have heard of Sir Richard Arkwright who died lately—</p>

                  <p>He did ſo; but having a ſtrong turn for mechanics, he invented, or at leaſt perfected, a machine, by which one pair of hands may do the work of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty; and, as in this country

every one is free to riſe by merit, he acquired the largeſt fortune in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had a great many hundreds of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men under his orders, and had leave given him by the King to put <hi>Sir</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his name.</p>

                  <p>It pleaſed him, I ſuppoſe, or he would not have accepted of it; and you will allow, I imagine, that if titles are uſed, it does honour to thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them, that they are given to ſuch as have made themſelves noticed for ſomething uſeful.—Arkwright uſed to ſay, that if he had time to perfect his inventions, he would put a fleece of wool into a box, and it ſhould come out broad cloth.</p>

                  <p>You hardly would; but there are Manufactures in which the material is much more changed than in woollen cloth.

Yet the furnace transforms this into that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent cryſtal we call <hi>glaſs,</hi> than which nothing is more ſparkling, more bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, more full of luſtre.

                  <p>It is certain that if a perſon ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Manufacture were to ſee one of our capital ſhops, he would think all the treaſures of Golconda were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered there, and that every drop of cut glaſs was worth a prince's ranſom.—Again, who would ſuppoſe, on ſeeing the green ſtalks of a plant, that it could be formed into a texture ſo ſmooth, ſo ſnowy-white, ſo firm, and yet ſo flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible as to wrap round the limbs and adapt itſelf to every movement of the body?

                  <p>Then you can form an idea of it; but you have ſeen only the moſt common ſorts. There was a chain made at Woodſtock, in Oxfordſhire, and ſent to France, which weighed only two ounces, and coſt 170l. Calculate how many times <hi>that</hi> had increaſed its value.</p>

                  <p>This is what Manufactures can do; here man is a kind of a creator, and, like the great Creator, he may pleaſe himſelf with his work, and ſay it is good.

                  <p>We have at preſent a greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety than I can pretend to enumerate, but our ſtaple Manufacture is woollen cloth. England abounds in fine paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and extenſive downs, which feed great numbers of ſheep; hence our wool has always been a valuable arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of trade; but we did not always know how to work it. We uſed to ſell it to the Flemiſh or Lombards, who wrought it into cloth; till in the year 1326, Edward the Third invited ſome Flemiſh weavers over to teach us the art; but there was not much made in England till the reign of Henry the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.

Mancheſter and Birmingham are towns which have ariſen to great conſequence from ſmall beginnings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt within the memory of old men now living; the firſt for cotton and muſlin goods, the ſecond for cutlery and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, in which we at this moment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all Europe. Of late years, too, carpets, beautiful as fine tapeſtry, have been fabricated in this country. Our clocks and watches are greatly eſteemed. The earthen-ware plates and diſhes, which we all uſe in common, and the elegant ſet for the tea-table, ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with muſical inſtruments, which we admired in our viſit yeſterday, belong to a very extenſive manufactory, the ſeat of which is at Burſlem in Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire. The principal potteries there belong to one perſon, an excellent chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and a man of great taſte; he, in conjunction with another man of taſte who is ſince dead, has made our clay more valuable than the fineſt porcelain

of China. He has moulded it into all the forms of grace and beauty that are to be met with in the precious remains of the Greek and Etruſcan artiſts. In the more common articles he has pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled it with the moſt elegant deſigns, ſhaped it into ſhells and leaves, twiſted it into wicker-work, and trailed the ductile foliage round the light baſket. He has filled our cabinets and chimney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces with urns, lamps, and vaſes, on which are lightly traced, with the pureſt ſimplicity, the fine forms and floating draperies of Herculaneum. In ſhort, he has given to our houſes a claſſic air, and has made every ſaloon and every din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room ſchools of taſte. I ſhould add that there is a great demand abroad for this elegant Manufacture. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of Ruſſia has had ſome magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſervices of it; and the other day one was ſent to the King of Spain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a preſent from him to the Archbiſhop of Toledo, which coſt a

               <p>THE Flying Fiſh, ſays the fable, had originally no wings; but being of an ambitious and diſcontented temper, ſhe repined at being always confined to the waters, and wiſhed to ſoar in the air. <q rend="inline">"If I could fly like the birds,"</q> ſaid ſhe, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould not only ſee more of the beauties of nature, but I ſhould be able to eſcape from thoſe fiſh which are continually purſuing me, and which render my life miſerable."</q> She therefore petitioned Jupiter for a pair of wings: and immediately ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her fins to expand. They ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly grew to the length of her whole body, and became at the ſame time ſo ſtrong as to do the office of a pinion. She was at firſt much pleaſed with her

new powers, and looked with an air of diſdain on all her former companions; but ſhe ſoon perceived herſelf expoſed to new dangers. When flying in the air, ſhe was inceſſantly purſued by the tropic bird, and the Albatroſs; and when for ſafety ſhe dropped into the water, ſhe was ſo fatigued with her flight, that ſhe was leſs able than ever to eſcape from her old enemies the fiſh. Finding herſelf more unhappy than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhe now begged of Jupiter to recal his preſent; but Jupiter ſaid to her, <q rend="inline">"When I gave you your wings, I well knew they would prove a curſe; but your proud and reſtleſs diſpoſition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this diſappointment. Now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what you begged as a favour, keep as a puniſhment!"</q>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>And from men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>True; but if you had been talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about birds, you would not have found it ſo eaſy to diſtinguiſh them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>How ſo! a man is not at all like a bird.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet an ancient philoſopher could find no way to diſtinguiſh them, but by calling man <hi>a two-legged animal without feathers.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>I think he was very ſilly; they are not at all alike, though they have both two legs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Another ancient philoſopher, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diogenes, was of your opinion. He ſtript a cock of his feathers, and turned him into the ſchool where Plato, that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0191002602:131"/>
was his name, was teaching, and ſaid, Here is Plato's man for you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>I wiſh I had been there, I ſhould have laughed very much.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Probably. Before we laugh at others, however, let us ſee what we can do ourſelves. We have not yet found any thing which will diſtinguiſh a horſe from an elephant, or from a Norway rat.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>O, that is eaſy enough. An ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant is very large, and a rat is very ſmall; a horſe is neither large nor ſmall.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Before we go any further, look what is ſettled on the ſkirt of your coat.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>It is a butterfly; what a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious large one! I never ſaw ſuch a one before.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Is it larger than a rat, think you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>No, that it is not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet you called the butterfly large, and you called the rat ſmall.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>It is very large for a butterfly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0191002602:132"/>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>It is ſo. You ſee, therefore, that large and ſmall are <hi>relative terms.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not well underſtand that phraſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>It means that they have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and determinate ſignification in themſelves, but are applied differently according to the other ideas which you join with them, and the different poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in which you view them. This butterfly, therefore, is <hi>large,</hi> compared with thoſe of its own ſpecies, and <hi>ſmall</hi> compared with many other ſpecies of animals. Beſides, there is no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which varies more than the ſize of individuals. If you were to give an idea of a horſe from its ſize, you would certainly ſay it was much bigger than a dog; yet if you take the ſmalleſt Shetland horſe, and the largeſt Iriſh greyhound, you will find them very much upon a par: ſize, therefore, is not a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by which you can accurately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0191002602:133"/>
one animal from another; nor yet is colour.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>No; there are black horſes, and bay, and white, and pied.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>But you have not ſeen that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of colours, in a hare, for inſtance.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>No, a hare is always brown.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet if you were to depend upon that circumſtance, you would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the idea of a hare to a mountaineer, or an inhabitant of Siberia; for he ſees them white as ſnow. We muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, find out ſome circumſtances that do not change like ſize and colour, and I may add ſhape, though they are not ſo obvious, nor perhaps ſo ſtriking. Look at the feet of quadrupeds; are they all alike?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>No; ſome have long taper claws, and ſome have thick clumſy feet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out claws.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>The thick ſeet are horny; are they not?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0191002602:134"/>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I recollect they are called hoofs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>And the feet that are not covered with horn, and are divided into claws, are called <hi>digitated,</hi> from <hi>digitus,</hi> a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; becauſe they are parted like fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Here, then, we have one grand diviſion of quadrupeds into <hi>hoofed</hi> and <hi>digitated.</hi> Of which diviſion is the horſe?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>He is hoofed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>There are a great many different kinds of horſes; did you ever know one that was not hoofed?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>No, never.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you think we run any hazard of a ſtranger telling us, Sir, horſes are hoofed indeed in your country, but in mine, which is in a different climate, and where we feed them differently, they have claws?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>No, I dare ſay not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Then we have got ſomething to our purpoſe; a circumſtance eaſily marked, which always belongs to the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0191002602:135"/>
animal, under every variation of ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or treatment. But an ox is hoofed, and ſo is a ſheep; we muſt diſtinguiſh ſtill farther. You have often ſtood by, I ſuppoſe, while the ſmith was ſhoeing a horſe. What kind of a hoof has he?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>It is round, and all in one piece.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>And is that of an ox ſo?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>No, it is divided.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>A horſe, then, is not only hoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>whole-hoofed.</hi> Now how many quadrupeds do you think there are in the world that are whole-hoofed?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed I do not know.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>There are, among all animals that we are acquainted with, either in this country or in any other, only the horſe, the aſs, and the zebra, which is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of wild aſs. Now, therefore, you ſee we have nearly accompliſhed our purpoſe; we have only to diſtinguiſh him from the aſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>That is eaſily done, I believe; I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0191002602:136"/>
ſhould be ſorry if any body could miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my little horſe for an aſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not ſo eaſy, however, as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; the eye readily diſtinguiſhes them by the air and general appearance, but naturaliſts have been rather puzzled to fix upon any ſpecific difference, which may ſerve the purpoſe of a definition. Some have, therefore, fixed upon the ears, others on the mane and tail. What kind of ears has an aſs?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>O, very long clumſy ears. Aſſes' ears are always laughed at.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>And the horſe?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>The horſe has ſmall ears, nicely turned, and upright.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>And the mane, is there no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>The horſe has a fine long flowing mane; the aſs has hardly any.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>And the tail; is it not fuller of hair in the horſe than in the aſs?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; the aſs has only a few long hairs at the end of his tail; but the horſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0191002602:137"/>
has a long buſhy tail, when it is not cut.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Which, by the way, it is pity it ever ſhould. Now, then, obſerve what particulars we have got. <hi>A horſe is an animal of the quadruped kind, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofed, with ſhort erect ears, a flowing mane, and a tail covered in every part with long ears.</hi> Now is there any other animal, think you, in the world that anſwers theſe particulars?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not know; this does not tell us a great deal about him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>And yet it tells us enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh him from all the different tribes of the creation which we are acquainted with in any part of the earth. Do you know now what we have been making?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>What?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>A DEFINITION. It is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a definition to diſtinguiſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the thing defined from every other thing, and to do it in as few terms as poſſible. Its object is to ſeparate the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0191002602:138"/>
ſubject of definition, firſt, from thoſe with which it has only a general reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; then, from thoſe which agree with it in a greater variety of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; and ſo on, till by conſtantly throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out all which have not the qualities we have taken notice of, we come at length to the individual or the ſpecies we wiſh to aſcertain. It is a kind of chaſe, and reſembles the manner of hunting in ſome countries, where they firſt encloſe a very large circle with their dogs, nets, and horſes; and then, by degrees, draw their toils cloſer and cloſer, driving their game before them till it is at length brought into ſo narrow a compaſs, that the ſportſmen have nothing to do but to knock down their prey.</p>

                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>Juſt as we have been hunting this horſe, till at laſt we held him faſt by his ears and his tail.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhould obſerve to you, that in the definition naturaliſts give of a horſe, it is generally mentioned that he has
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0191002602:139"/>
ſix cutting teeth in each jaw; becauſe this circumſtance of the teeth has been found a very convenient one for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſing large claſſes: but as it is not abſolutely neceſſary here, I have omitted it; a definition being the more perfect the fewer particulars you make uſe of, provided you can ſay with certainty from thoſe particulars, The object ſo characteriſed muſt be this, and no other whatever.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>But, papa, if I had never ſeen a horſe, I ſhould not know what kind of animal it was by this definition.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Let us hear, then, how you would give me an idea of a horſe.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>I would ſay it was a fine large prancing creature, with ſlender legs and an arched neck, and a ſleek ſmooth ſkin, and a tail that ſweeps the ground, and that he ſnorts and neighs very loud, and toſſes his head, and runs as ſwift as the wind.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>I think you learned ſome verſes
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0191002602:140"/>
upon the horſe in your laſt leſſon: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them.</p>

                     <l>Pamper'd and proud, he ſeeks the wonted tides,</l>

                  <p>A deſcription is intended to give you a lively picture of an object, as if you ſaw it; it ought to be very full. A definition gives no picture to thoſe who have not ſeen it; it rather tells you what its ſubject is not, than what it is, by giving you ſuch clear ſpecific marks, that it ſhall not be poſſible to confound
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0191002602:141"/>
it with any thing elſe; and hence it is of the greateſt uſe in throwing things into claſſes. We have a great many beautiful deſcriptions from antient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſo looſely worded that we cannot certainly tell what animals are meant by them, whereas if they had given us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, three lines would have aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their meaning.</p>

               <head>THE PHENIX AND DOVE.</head>
               <p>A Phenix, who had long inhabited the ſolitary deſerts of Arabia, once flew ſo near the habitations of men as to meet with a tame Dove, who was ſitting on her neſt, with wings expanded, and fondly brooding over her young ones, while ſhe expected her mate, who was foraging abroad to procure them food. The Phenix, with a kind of inſulting compaſſion, ſaid to her, <q rend="inline">"Poor bird, how much I pity thee! confined to a ſingle ſpot, and ſunk in domeſtic cares, thou art continually employed either in laying eggs or in providing for thy brood; and thou exhauſteſt thy life and ſtrength in perpetuating a feeble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs race. As to myſelf, I live ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from toil, care, and misfortune. I feed upon nothing leſs precious than rich gums and ſpices; I fly through the trackleſs regions of the air, and when I
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0191002602:143"/>
am ſeen by men, am gazed at with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and aſtoniſhment; I have no one to controul my range, no one to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for; and when I have fulfilled my five centuries of life, and ſeen the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of ages, I rather vaniſh than die, and a ſucceſſor without my care, ſprings up from my aſhes. I am an image of the great ſun whom I adore; and glory in being, like him, ſingle and alone, and having no likeneſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Dove replied, <q rend="inline">"O Phenix, I pity thee much more than thou affecteſt to pity me! What pleaſure canſt thou enjoy, who liveſt forlorn and ſolitary in a trackleſs and unpeopled deſert; who haſt no mate to careſs thee, no young ones to excite thy tenderneſs and reward thy cares, no kindred, no ſociety amongſt thy fellows. Not long life only, but immortality itſelf would be a curſe, if it were to be beſtowed on ſuch uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable terms. For my part, I know that my life will be ſhort, and therefore
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0191002602:144"/>
I employ it in raiſing a numerous poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and in opening my heart to all the ſweets of domeſtic happineſs. I am beloved by my partner; I am dear to man; and ſhall leave marks behind me that I have lived. As to the ſun, to whom thou haſt preſumed to compare thyſelf, that glorious being is ſo totally different from, and ſo infinitely ſuperior to, all the creatures upon earth, that it does not become us to liken ourſelves to him, or to determine upon the manner of his exiſtence. One obvious differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, however, thou mayeſt remark; that the ſun, though alone, by his prolific heat, produces all things, and though he ſhines ſo high above our heads, gives us reaſon every moment to bleſs his beams; whereas thou, ſwelling with thy imaginary greatneſs, dreameſt away a long period of exiſtence, equally void of comfort and uſefulneſs."</q>

               <head>THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.</head>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>I WILL now, as I promiſed, give you an account of the elegant and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manufacture of <hi>Paper,</hi> the baſis of which is itſelf a manufacture. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and beautiful ſubſtance is made from the meaneſt and moſt diſguſting materials, from old rags, which have paſſed from one poor perſon to another, and at length have perhaps dropped in tatters from the child of the beggar. Theſe are carefully picked up from dunghills, or bought from ſervants by Jews, who make it their buſineſs to go about and collect them. They ſell them to the rag-merchant, who gives from two-pence to four-pence a pound, according to their quality; and he, when he has got a ſufficient quantity, diſpoſes of them to the owner of the paper-mill. He gives them firſt to women to ſort and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0191002602:146"/>
pick, agreeably to their different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of fineneſs: they alſo with a knife cut out carefully all the ſeams, which they throw into a baſket for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: they then put them into the duſting-engine, a large circular wire ſieve, from whence they receive ſome degree of cleanſing. The rags are then conveyed to the mill. Here they were formerly beat to pieces with vaſt ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, which roſe and fell continually with a moſt tremendous noiſe that was heard from a great diſtance. But now they put the rags into a large trough or ciſtern, into which a pipe of clear ſpring water is conſtantly flowing. In this ciſtern is placed a cylinder, about two feet long, ſet thick round with rows of iron ſpikes, ſtanding as near as they can to one another without touching. At the bottom of the trough there are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding rows of ſpikes. The cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder is made to whirl round with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable rapidity, and with theſe iron
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0191002602:147"/>
teeth rends and tears the cloth in every poſſible direction; till, by the aſſiſtance of the water, which continually flows through the ciſtern, it is thoroughly maſticated, and reduced to a fine pulp; and by the ſame proceſs all its impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are cleanſed away, and it is reſtored to its original whiteneſs. This proceſs takes about ſix hours. To improve the colour they then put in a little ſmalt, which gives it that bluiſh caſt which all Paper has more or leſs: the French Paper has leſs of it than ours. This fine pulp is next put into a copper of warm water. It is the ſubſtance of paper, but the form muſt now be given it: for this purpoſe they uſe a mould. It is made of wire, ſtrong one way, and croſſed with finer. This mould they juſt dip horizontally into the copper, and take it out again. It has a little wooden frame on the edge, by means of which it retains as much of the pulp as is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the thickneſs of the ſheet, and the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0191002602:148"/>
ſuperfluity runs off through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the wires. Another man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly receives it, opens the frame, and turns out the thin ſheet, which has now ſhape, but not conſiſtence, upon ſoft felt, which is placed on the ground to receive it. On that is placed another piece of felt, and then another ſheet of Paper, and ſo on till they have made a pile of forty or fifty. They are then preſſed with a large ſcrew-preſs, moved by a long lever, which forcibly ſqueezes the water out of them, and gives them immediate conſiſtence. There is ſtill however, a great deal to be done. The felts are taken off and thrown on one ſide, and the Paper on the other, from whence it is dexterouſly taken up with an inſtrument in the form of a T, three ſheets at a time, and hung on lines to dry. There it hangs for a week or ten days, which likewiſe further whitens it; and any knots and roughneſſes it may have are picked off carefully by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0191002602:149"/>
It is then ſized. Size is a kind of glue; and without this preparation the Paper would not bear ink; it would run and blot as you ſee it does on grey Paper. The ſheets are juſt dipped into the ſize, and taken out again. The exact degree of ſizing is a matter of nicety, which can only be known by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. They are then hung up again to dry, and when dry taken to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing-room, where they are examined a new, preſſed in the dry preſſes, which gives them their laſt gloſs and ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; counted out into quires, made up in reams, and ſent to the ſtationer's, from whom we have it, after he has folded it again and cut the edges; ſome too he makes to ſhine like ſatin, by gloſſing it with hot plates. The whole proceſs of Paper-making takes about three weeks.</p>

                  <p>It is true that there is hardly any thing we uſe with ſo much waſte and profuſion as this manufacture; we ſhould think ourſelves confined in the uſe of it, if we might not tear, diſperſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it in a thouſand ways; ſo that it is really aſtoniſhing from whence linen enough can be procured to anſwer ſo vaſt a demand. As to the coarſe brown papers, of which an aſtoniſhing quantity is uſed by every ſhopkeeper in pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, &amp;c. theſe are made chiefly of oakum, that is, old hempen ropes. A fine paper is made in China of ſilk.</p>

                  <p>Your queſtion is very natural. In order to anſwer it, I muſt deſire you to take a ſheet of common Paper, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0191002602:151"/>
hold it up againſt the light. Do not you ſee marks in it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſee a great many white lines running along lengthways, like ribs, and ſmaller that croſs them. I ſee, too, letters and the figure of a crown.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe are all the marks of the wires; the thickneſs of the wire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents ſo much of the pulp lying upon the ſheet in thoſe places, conſequently wherever the wires are, the Paper is thinner, and you ſee the light through more readily, which gives that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of white lines. The letters too are worked in the wire, and are the maker's name. Now to prevent theſe lines, which take off from the beauty of the Paper, particularly of drawing Paper, there have been lately uſed moulds of braſs wire exceeding fine, of equal thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and woven or latticed one within another; the marks, therefore, of theſe are eaſily preſſed out, ſo as to be hardly
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0191002602:152"/>
viſible; if you look at this ſheet you will ſee it is quite ſmooth.</p>

                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhould mention to you, that there is a diſcovery very lately made, by which they can make Paper equal to any in whiteneſs, of the coarſeſt brown rags, and even of dyed cottons; which they have till now been obliged to throw by for inferior purpoſes. This is by means of manganeſe, a ſort of mineral, and oil of vitriol; a mixture of which they juſt paſs through the pulp, while it is in water, for otherwiſe it would burn it, and in an inſtant it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges the colours of the dyed cloths, and bleaches the brown to a beautiful whiteneſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H.</speaker>
                  <p>That is like what you told me before of bleaching cloth in a few hours.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>It is indeed founded upon the ſame diſcovery. The Paper made of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0191002602:153"/>
theſe brown rags is likewiſe more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, from being very tough and ſtrong, almoſt like parchment.</p>

                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>It is a diſputed point, but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the fourteenth century. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention has been of almoſt equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to literature, as that of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf; and ſhows how the arts and ſciences, like children of the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, mutually aſſiſt and bring forward each other.</p>
