            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Eſſays, among many more of the ſame Nature, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as is hinted in the Title-Page, at the Deſire, and for the Uſe, of a young Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and tranſmitted to him in ſo many Letters, on the following laudable Occaſion. His Friends had procured him a confiderable Benefice in the Country, where he no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came to reſide, than he was attacked by ſeveral of his Neighbours, moſt of them Men of Wit and Figure, and profeſſed Sceptics, about the above-mentioned, and other ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subjects, of the like important Nature; in which he had the Misfortune to be ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0177700400:3"/>
verſed, that he muſt, in all Likelihood, have become the frequent Subject of their Raillery, and led a very uneaſy Life among them, had not his good Senſe, and ſingular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, directed him to an Expedient, that would at leaſt intitle him to, if not procure him, better Quarter from them: And this was, by ingenuouſly owning himſelf, as yet, too young, and unacquainted with the Topicks they urged againſt him, to enter the Liſts with ſuch ſeaſoned Opponents; and begging of them, for Truth's ſake, that he might be allowed the Liberty of turning theſe Points in Diſpute over to a Perſon whom he knew to have been, of a long time, converſant with that kind of Learning; and who had lately publiſhed ſome occaſional Remarks upon ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Subjects of the like controverted Nature, which had been well received by the Public. So juſt and modeſt a Propoſal could hardly fail of being complied with; and they came into it the more readily, it ſeems, when he appriſed them, that the Perſon he deſigned to apply to was an obſcure Layman, who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0177700400:4"/>
had ſpent a great Part of his latter Years in Privacy and Retirement, and who, he had Reaſon to believe, was in no way addicted or bigotted to either Party or Opinion. They only expreſſed a Deſire to know his Name, and ſuch other Particulars as he ſhould think fit to acquaint them with; both which he declined to do, without my Leave, leſt that ſhould induce me to refuſe the Taſk; as he was fully appriſed of the Care I had taken to conceal my being the Author of thoſe Productions from all but a few ſelect Friends. I failed not, in my next Letter, to thank him for his kind Caution; and to aſſure him of my Unwillingneſs to comply with his Requeſt upon any other Terms: To which he inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, ſoon after, they all readily acquieſced: Immediately after which our epiſtolary Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence began; and each of the Subjects in Debate were regularly conveyed to me by him, with full Liberty of methodizing both the Objections and Anſwers, in ſuch manner as I thought would prove moſt convincing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0177700400:5"/>
and ſatisfactory to them; or to the Public, in caſe I ſhould be inclined to make them ſo.</p>
            <p>This Licence proved the more acceptable to me, becauſe, though I had then no View of printing them, yet I found the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of thoſe Subjects treated by his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts in ſo trivial and ludicrous a manner, as if they had been fitter for Ridicule, than an impartial Examination. So that I made no Difficulty to take them at their Word, and to retrench as much of the ſarcaſtical Pleaſantry out of their Objections, as I found void of Reaſoning; as well as to ſoften the Profaneneſs and Scurrility of their Language, where-ever it could be done without leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Weight and Strength of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. And thus much may ſuffice for the Occaſion of my writing theſe Eſſays.</p>
            <p>I muſt, however, acquaint the Reader, that the five above-mentioned Subjects were not the only controverted ones that were ſent to me from the ſame Quarter. Several others
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0177700400:6"/>
they ſucceſſively communicated to me, no leſs curious and important: Some of which, I found, had been ſo fully and learnedly treated, by a Set of Gentlemen, in a late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Work, that I made no Scruple to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our Antagoniſts to it, for a ſatisfactory Anſwer to all their Objections<note n="a" place="bottom">

               </note>. Of this Nature were thoſe two miraculous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, mentioned in the Old Teſtament; <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſſage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> through the <hi>Red Sea (Exod.</hi> xiv.); and the ſupernatural Solſtice obtained by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> their new Chief, in the Land of <hi>Canaan (Joſh.</hi> x.): To which I may add a third, which gave me no leſs Pleaſure to find ſo juſtly and evidently clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe curious Gentlemen, and in a manner entirely new; <hi>viz.</hi> the different Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies given of Chriſt, in the Goſpels of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi>

                  <hi>Ibid. vol.</hi> x. <hi>p.</hi> 451, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> (R).</note>; a Point that hath lately exerciſed ſome of our beſt Heads. And this I the more readily did, in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0177700400:7"/>
hopes that if I could, by that means, bring my polemic Correſpondents to be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that extenſive Work, they would find ſo many Difficulties of the like Nature ſo ſatisfactorily cleared, as would, of courſe, much leſſen the Matter of this our epiſtolary Controverſy, as well as induce them to treat theſe ſerious and important Subjects in a leſs ludicrous and offenſive manner.</p>
            <p>As for the Occaſion of my now publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the five following ones, I ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt here on the kind Invitations I had to it, from ſome of my worthy Country Friends, who had both peruſed them, and been Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the good Effect they had on ſome of my young Clergyman's Antagoniſts; for if that had had a ſufficient Weight with me, they had appeared in Print ſome Years ago. Neither could the various Attempts that have been made, from time to time, by ſo many eminent Hands, againſt the Authority of the ſacred Books, have induced me to it ſince
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0177700400:8"/>
then; becauſe I could ſee neither Objection nor Argument in any of them, if we except, perhaps, the Newneſs and Variety of their Dreſs, but had been fully exploded over and over, by Perſons of equal Senſe and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and much ſuperior to them, in the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World's Eye, in point of Judgment, and fair ſolid Reaſoning; and (what could not but leſſen one's Value of them) without paying any Regard to, or taking the leaſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, what had been ſo often, and ſo powerfully, urged on the other Side of the Queſtion. This Treatment appears ſtill the more unfair, as they have not hitherto made any freſh Attack on their Side, but hath been ſoon after fairly examined and confuted on ours; and, I may add, in a more civil, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, candid, and impartial Way, than we have, as yet, met from them, though they ſo frequently charge us with the contrary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; but how juſtly, let every Reader judge, from all that hath been written on either Side. I was therefore ſo well ſatisfied, upon the Whole, that the Foundation of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0177700400:9"/>
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and Chriſtian Revelation, as well as the Evidence of the Miracles upon which both are built, were out of all Danger of being ſhaken by any Attempt that had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been made, or, as I imagined, could be made, againſt it from that Quarter, that I could not ſuppoſe this occaſional Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of mine could add any Weight to that Variety of ſolid Arguments, and Cloud of unqueſtionable Teſtimonies, that had been urged in its Defence. I was rather in hopes, that after the Divine Authority both of the Law and Goſpel had been ſo clearly and learnedly demonſtrated, all the other Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Cavils which have been raiſed againſt them, would eaſily have yielded to that ſuperior Evidence, and have ſubſided of their own Accord; inſtead of furniſhing our ſceptic Opponents with freſh Occaſion of diſcrediting and ridiculing the ſacred Records, by magnifying and miſrepreſenting thoſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties at the unfair Rate they have lately done, and as if they were of themſelves ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to invalidate their divine Authority,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0177700400:10"/>
and the Credibility of the great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Miracles upon which it is founded<note n="c" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See the Author of the Characteriſtics, Collins, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, Chub, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note>. But as thoſe further Exceptions could never be deemed, by the ſerious Part of Mankind, ſufficient to outweigh ſo great an Evidence, a new Expedient muſt be thought on, that might at once overturn both the Foundation and Superſtructure; and that was, by trying to deſtroy, not only the Probability, but even the Poſſibility, of all Miracles. To this End, among other Champions, one of them, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed Infidel, boldly enters the Liſts, under the Diſguiſe of a <hi>Moral Philoſopher;</hi> and not only attacks the greateſt and beſt atteſted Miracle of the Goſpel, againſt the learned Author of the Trial of the Witneſſes<note n="d" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Reſurrection conſidered, p.</hi> 89, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
               </note>; but, on the Strength of an imaginary Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, concludes that indigeſted Performance with what he ſtiles a full and unanſwerable Confutation of the Reality and Poſſibility of any of the reſt: His ſwelling Stile induces
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0177700400:11"/>
one to believe, that he comes fraught with ſome new-ſet Arguments, that will give a deciſive Blow to the Controverſy between us; whilſt, in Fact, he produces none but ſuch trite and exploded ones, as give Reaſon to expect, that ſomething more effectual is ſtill behind, and kept in reſerve for the concluding Blow; without which one would hardly have the Patience to follow him through ſo much Scurrility, Arrogance, and Impiety; and you are not appriſed of your Miſtake, till you are inſenſibly brought to the End of the Book.</p>
            <p>This Piece, however, which had ſo little Novelty to recommend it, except the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Inveteracy of its Stile, gave our Country Antagoniſts ſuch new Matter for Triumph, that my young Clergyman was forced to call upon me for freſh Aſſiſtance; every Argument in it appearing to them both new and deciſive, ſo little were they verſed in that trite Controverſy: And I ſhould have had the irkſome Taſk of confuting them, had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0177700400:12"/>
not I been timely relieved by a much abler Hand, which appeared ſoon after, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Trial of the Witneſſes;</hi> and, in a few Pages at the End of it, exploded all his pretended Reaſoning againſt the Poſſibility of Miracles, in ſo clear, nervous, and convincing a manner<note n="e" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Evidence of the Reſurrection cleared, p.</hi> 143, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
               </note>, as, I doubted not, would, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bare Reading, effectually ſatisfy them, and excuſe my proceeding farther upon that Head, as well as from publiſhing any of the other Subjects of our epiſtolary Controverſy; unleſs ſome future, and more proper, Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould induce me to it. But this, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, would not be in Haſte, conſidering the ſignal Defeat which that daring Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion had met with, after having ſpent ſo long a time in raking up all the Objections, and ſophiſtical Reaſoning, of his whole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Tribe, againſt the Poſſibility of all Miracles, and in dreſſing them up in the moſt aſſuming and invidious Terms; for this bold Piece did not appear in Print, till the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0177700400:13"/>
one he pretended to anſwer had gone through a tenth Edition: And it was, in all Likelihood, the Succeſs, and univerſal Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, this laſt ſo juſtly met with, that cauſed ſuch an extraordinary Profuſion of Gall in our pretended Moral Philoſopher, beyond what is uſually met with in the Writings of his Brethren: So that it was now high time for them to look out for ſome ſkilful Hand, to wipe off, as much as poſſible, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit which that frantic Performance had done to them, and their Cauſe; by reſuming its Defence, if not by a new Recruit of more ſolid Arguments (their Logic and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy having been long exhauſted), by dreſſing the old exploded ones in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite and artful Trim, as might carry, at leaſt, the Appearance of Novelty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more eaſily inſinuate them into the Minds of the Thoughtleſs and Unwary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving ſuch great Offence to thoſe of the oppoſite Side.</p>

            <p>Now, if the Notion of future Rewards and Puniſhments, founded on a mere abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſe Reaſoning, be allowed to be of any Efficacy towards the Preſervation of the Peace and Intereſt of Society; how much greater Influence muſt it be ſuppoſed to have on the Minds and Actions of Men, when once ſirmly believed to be founded on the Authority of a Divine Revelation; and ſuch a Revelation, as is ſo exactly calculated to promote the moſt ſocial and exalted Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and to enforce them, by the nobleſt and moſt powerful Motives?

by gradual Steps, to its full Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by our Divine Redeemer, under the Light of his glorious Goſpel. For if it can be once fairly proved, againſt all our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, to be every way conſiſtent with the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to interpoſe his divine Power, in order to rectify the enormous Diſorders that had been introduced into the moral World, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in Religion; then it will be no leſs evident, that no Period could be more ſeaſonable, to lay the Foundation of ſuch a Reformation, than this; when the civil Power, and the Avarice of the heathen Prieſts, had rendered the Diſtemper incurable by any other means, than by ſuch a Series of Wonders: No Scene more proper to diſplay them in than <hi>Egypt;</hi> where the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Idolatry and Worſhip had its Birth, and had ſpread itſelf into all other Countries, far and near.

their pretended Deities, or againſt ſome other Branch of their idolatrous Theology; and conſequently every way conducive to the main Deſign of convincing that infatuated People, by the moſt rational means, of God's abſolute Superintendency and Government over the whole Creation.</p>
            <p>The extraordinary Adventure of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the ſingular Circumſtances that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied it, have been likewiſe the Subject of much Cavil and Ridicule among our Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and of Doubt and Diſſatisfaction among the far greater Part of Believers, both <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians; either for want of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or Capacity, to give it a due and ſerious Examination; many of them, even among the latter, looking upon the whole Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action as ſcarce worth, or fit to bear, a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny. Yet I am willing to hope, that what I have ſaid upon it will eaſily reconcile any impartial Reader to the moſt exceptionable Part of it, and make the Whole to appear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uniform, agreeable, and conducing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0177700400:28"/>
to the ſame gracious Syſtem of the Divine Providence. But of all the Tranſactions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Old Teſtament, none have been objected ſo much againſt, or with ſo great Appearance of Reaſon, as thoſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing ſwift Marches, and ſignal Victories, aſcribed to <hi>Joſhua, Saul,</hi> and other <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chiefs; and which, conſidering the plain and ſuccinct Stile in which they are related by the ſacred Penmen, are clogged with ſo many geographical and other Difficulties, as have appeared, to ſome of the ableſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators, altogether inſurmountable. I have, in the following Eſſays, ſingled out two of the moſt remarkable Inſtances of that Kind; <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Joſhua</hi> over <hi>Jabin,</hi> King of <hi>Hazor,</hi> and his numberleſs Confederates; and the ſwift Conqueſt of Northern <hi>Canaan,</hi> that immediately followed it<note n="r" place="bottom">

               <note n="s" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xi. <hi>paſſ.</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0177700400:29"/>
which give it the Appearance of Impoſſibility, that moſt Critics and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators have been contented to let the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility of it reſt on the ſole Authority of the inſpired Writer. And yet I dare flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have made it plainly appear, in the laſt of theſe Eſſays, that there wanted nothing but a competent Acquaintance with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Laws, and martial Diſcipline, of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> together with ſome Attention to the Geography of their Country, and the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of their reſpective Tribes, both with regard to each other, and to the heathen Nations round about them, to diſpel all thoſe ſeemingly unſurmountable Difficulties, and to demonſtrate that whole Tranſaction to be every way as feaſible and probable (though, in moſt reſpects, as great and noble, if not much more ſo), as any that is to be met with in ſacred or profane Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>This laſt Piece, it is hoped, the Reader will not be diſpleaſed to ſee publiſhed in a different Form from the reſt (<hi>viz.</hi> in that of a

And I own my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf highly obliged to you, for having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged yourſelf to conceal my Name, unleſs permitted by me to do otherwiſe; which I cannot by any means conſent to, upon ſeveral Conſiderations I need not trouble you and them with; one of which will, however, eaſily occur to you, that it is too obſcure, and too little known, to add any Weight to what I ſhall tranſmit to you. On its own Merit let it ſtand or fall. One thing you may indeed acquaint them with, becauſe it may, in all Probability, make a favourable Impreſſion on them; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Writer is a Layman, who, tho' neither deſigned for, nor ever intending to enter into Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, hath yet choſen to dedicate the greater Part of his latter Life to this kind of Study; but hath ſtill, for ſome not unworthy Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0177700400:34"/>
carefully concealed his Name; altho' ſome of his Productions have met with a good Reception from the Public. And as you are ſufficiently appriſed, that this is my caſe, ſo it can hardly fail of meeting with a ready Belief from a Perſon of your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Integrity. Thus much in Anſwer to the former Part of your Letter.</p>
               <p>As to the Objections and Difficulties raiſed by them againſt ſeveral miraculous and other hiſtorical Facts, recorded in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="a" place="bottom">Theſe are particularly mentioned in the Title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page and Preface.</note>, as I have long ago had occaſion to examine them at my leiſure Hours, ſo I doubt not to convince them in the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Eſſays, that they chiefly ariſe either from their not being ſufficiently acquainted with, or their not having given ſufficient Attention to, the peculiar Genius of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Idiom, the Laws, Diſcipline, and Cuſtoms, of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the uniform and general Deſign of Providence towards them; and more particularly to a Miſapprehenſion of their being calculated ſolely in favour of that Nation; whereas, in fact, they were no leſs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0177700400:35"/>
deſigned and fitted for the Benefit of the reſt of the heathen World. So that if your ſceptic Neighbours are the Perſons of Senſe and Candour you repreſent them, I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf I ſhall find no great Difficulty in removing all that Heap of Doubts and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which they have thrown in your way, with reſpect to the Facts in queſtion; and, at the ſame time, make it appear to their Satisfaction, that this admirable and long Series of Miracles which were wrought both in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were ſo far from being calculated in favour of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation only, that they are no leſs than a gradual and uniform Sequel of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scheme, which had been laid ever ſince the Creation, for the Benefit of all Mankind, and was to be fully completed in the Perſon of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> when the Fulneſs of the Time was come.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, as you inform me, that ſome of your Antagoniſis are great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of the noble Author of the <hi>Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtics,</hi> of <hi>Collins, Tindal,</hi> the late Writer of the <hi>Moral Philoſopher,</hi> and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Oppoſers of Divine Revelation, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0177700400:36"/>
of the Miracles on which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion are built, it will be highly requiſite, before I proceed farther, to take a ſhort Examen of the Arguments by which thoſe Authors pretend to prove, not only the Incredibility, but likewiſe the Impoſſibility, of all Miracles in general, as well as of thoſe which are urged in Confirmation of the Law and Goſpel. Were a mere Stranger to gueſs at the Merit of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Revelation, by the indefatigable Pains which theſe pretended Well-wiſhers to Mankind, and public Society, have taken to overthrow it, he muſt of courſe conclude it to be one of the worſt, and the moſt dangerous, inſtead of the moſt beneficial and comfortable Syſtems of Religion in the World. And if we were to meaſure the Succeſs of their Labour, either by the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Admirers, or by the victorious Applauſes they aſſume to themſelves, or have received from them, we could not hardly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any thing but that they had long ſince gained their Point, and ſilenced all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, by the moſt irreſragable Arguments, and cleareſt Demonſtration<note n="b" place="bottom">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0177700400:37"/>
plainly ſee, that as on the one hand they have never dared yet openly to impugn the excellent Morality of its Precepts, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they been able, on the other, to undermine its Foundation, by all the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Engines they have ſet on work for that purpoſe. They have all, indeed, made ſtrong Efforts to cry down the Validity, Truth, Probability, and ſome of them even Poſſibility, of thoſe numberleſs Miracles on which its Evidence is chiefly founded: They have left no Art untried, to expoſe them as contrary to Reaſon, and the Experience of Mankind, and what they know of the ſtated Laws and Courſe of Nature: They have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented them as inconſiſtent with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of the Supreme Being, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Evidences of the Doctrines they are urged in Proof of. Some of them have endeavour'd to expoſe the Law, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as unneceſſary and impertinent Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>Mens natural Faculties being able to teach them the moſt excellent Morals, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with the moſt effectual Incentives to</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0177700400:38"/>
                  <hi>the Obſervation of them, and to inſpire them with the trueſt Notions of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a well grounded Belief of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, and his Providence:</hi> Which, if true, overturns at once the Neceſſity of a Revelation, and of the Miracles urged in Proof of it. Others again as poſitively affirm, that ſuch Revelations were not only need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but that the admitting of any ſuch, implies ſome extraordinary Defect in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rai World, which requires a Divine Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to amend it: Whereas all God's Works, being the Reſult of infinite Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, can never be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſtand in need of any Amendment, much leſs of a Divine Interpoſition to rectify them. Laſtly, they affirm, with the ſame Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that if ſuch an Interpoſition of the Divine Power was ever requiſite upon that, or any other Occaſion, it muſt have been always, and ever continue to be ſo. If Miracles, therefore, were thought neceſſary or expedient at any time, they muſt be ſo at all times; becauſe, ſay they, whoever ſuppoſes God to have wrought them in one Generation, and not in another, muſt of

               <p>From this ſhort Scantling I have given of the Premiſes and Concluſion, you, and your ſceptic Neighbours, may clearly ſee what Pains thoſe Authors have taken to eradicate, as far as poſſible, the very Notion of a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, founded on Miracles, out of the World. And it was natural for them to prefer that expeditious Way to any other: And ſince they could not ſtand againſt the Shafts that galled them from that Battery, to endeavour, by any means, to blow it up. And if their ſanguine Hopes have hitherto failed of Succeſs, the World will at leaſt ſay
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0177700400:40"/>
thus much in Juſtice to them, that their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment is owing to ſome other Cauſe, than to the want of Zeal, or hard ſtruggling for it, on their Part: Whilſt thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect more juſtly upon it, will, probably, be reminded of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s infallible Promiſe to his Church<note n="e" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> xvi. 18.</note>, that he would protect it to the End of Time, and againſt much more powerful and dangerous Attempts than any of theſe Gentlemen can make againſt it. But this more properly belonging to your Province, I ſhall leave to you to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and urge againſt your Opponents, as occaſion offers. And as I doubt not but you are by this time thoroughly acquainted with thoſe excellent Authors, who have written in Defence of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Revelation<note n="f" place="bottom">I ſhall here inſert ſome of the principal of them, for the ſake of the younger Sort of Readers.

againſt Revelation more ſolidly founded, and their Inferences more fairly drawn, than they will be found, upon cloſer Examination, to be: For, even in ſuch caſe, the Merit of the Controverſy, at the beſt, will be ſtill left in Suſpenſe, until they have fully conſulted all that hath been urged in Defence of it; and all that a Reader of a moderate Capacity could conclude, after a careful Peruſal of both Sides, would be only this, that it was a Point about which much might, and had been urged <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con.;</hi> but on which Side to fix, he was ſtill at a Loſs. 'Tis true, one thing muſt greatly help to determine him in favour of our Side, who are the Defendants in Poſſeſſion; <hi>viz.</hi> our Readineſs, at all times, to enter the Liſt with them on the faireſt Terms, and to give their Arguments a candid Hearing, as well as the moſt ſolid and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Anſwers; whilſt they, without paying the leaſt Regard to them, take all Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities they can, to appear in the Field with the ſame Air of Triumph, tho' ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, and with the ſame old weather-beaten Invalids, kept up, it ſeems, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, upon every freſh Occaſion, to make a ſhort-liv'd Parade in ſome new modiſh Dreſs,

and be laid up again till farther Orders. It would be no difficult Matter to diſcover the Grounds of theſe ſo frequent and indecent Inſults on a Revelation that hath the Seal of Heaven for its Credentials; the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and exalted Morality for its Voucher; the Teſtimony of all Antiquity, Foes as well as Friends, for its Evidence; the moſt conſiderable Men of all Ages for Learning, Judgment, and Integrity, for its Defenders; and the Legiſlative Power for its Support. But I ſhall leave that to you, and others, to infer from the plain Tendency and Spirit of their Writings, and the Nature of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they would ſubſtitute in its ſtead. There you'll likewiſe ſee, with Eaſe, the true Motive of their ſingular Contempt for the Clergy, eſpecially of thoſe who have written moſt clearly and powerfully in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Chriſtianity, or moſt effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and exploded the Sophiſtry and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of their Arguments againſt its Evidence from Miracles. This laſt is indeed an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, or Injury, perhaps, in their Senſe, they will not eaſily forgive them; as it hath caſt no ſmall Reflection on their Integrity, as well as Judgment; and, by that means,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0177700400:43"/>

It is not unlikely neither, that your ſceptic Neighbours, and others of their Admirers and Diſciples, may flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Hopes of better Days, and an happier World, ſhould theſe Demagogues prove ſo ſucceſsful as to become the only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors and Reformers of it; and, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their ſo much boaſted Syſtem of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion to be adopted inſtead of the Chriſtian, which is now eſtabliſh'd, ſet hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Reaſon at once free from the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of myſterious Creeds, and their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubjects from the Dominion of Prieſtcraft, and other religious Impoſitions: So that every one might live peaceably under his own Vine, and under his own Fig-tree: And I may add, in his own Way, without Fear or Danger of Coercion, or other Diſturbance from thoſe hot Zealots for Revelation. But were that more likely to be ever the caſe than it is, I can ſee but little Reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0177700400:44"/>
that we of the Laity ſhould meet with berter Quarter, by becoming the Diſciples and Catechumens of theſe new Guides, than we enjoy under our preſent ones; or that Men that betray ſo much Subtilty and Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in their Reaſonings, and ſhew themſelves, in the higheſt Degree, either ſceptical or dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, as beſt ſuits with their Purpoſe, could much better agree in any one Syſtem of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality or Religion than ours do, or indulge their Diſciples in a greater Freedom of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acting than theſe do their Flocks. Hitherto they have been only endeavouring to undermine and pull down an old Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture they do not like: But if we may gueſs from thence, how they will act when they come to build their new one, it is much to be feared, that, let them ſplit themſelves into ever ſo many Syſtems about it, they will agree in this one Canon, to turn Scepticiſm over to their Hearers, and to allow of none to act the Dogmatiſts but thoſe that ſit in the Chair. But, not to create to ourſelves need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fears from their ill-grounded Hopes, let us now take a ſhort Survey of thoſe pretended irrefragable Arguments they have hitherto urged againſt the Credibility and Poſſibility
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0177700400:45"/>
of Miracles; and on the Strength of which one of their lateſt Writers hath made no Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to affirm they may, and ought to be, rejected, as Deluſions and Forgeries, merely on account of their being Miracles, let the Authority of the Recorder, or Evidence of the Fact, be what they will; becauſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, the Evidence of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony muſt naturally riſe or fall, according as the Fact related is more or leſs agreeable to our common Experience and Obſervation: The Conſequence of which muſt be, That <hi>where the Fact atteſted hath ſeldom fallen under Obſervation, there is a Conteſt of two oppoſite Experiences, of which the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the other, as far as its Force goes</hi>

This ſtrange Way of Reaſoning, which ſeems to imply, that <hi>want of Obſervation,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Obſervation, are the ſame Thing,</hi> hath been already ſo clearly confuted by a learned Author<note n="i" place="bottom">

Roſes would be apt to make, concerning their Gardener, and conclude him to be ſome eternal and unchangeable Being, becauſe they had never obſerved any Alteration in him, either with reſpect to Age, Dreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, if I may be permitted to carry the Alluſion a little farther, Let us ſuppoſe, that they had ſome authentic Records, that this ſame Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener had, many Generations before, made a much finer Appearance for ſome time, that is, in his <hi>Sunday</hi>'s Dreſs; or that in ſome Corner of the Roſe-buſh there had been kept a conſtant Tradition, and very authentic Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents and Records, that the ſame Gardener, in ſome Ages ſtill more remote, had been ſo kind to the whole Shrub, as to cut down a Tree which greatly incommoded it by its Shade, and frequent dropping of Rain; or that he had planted a very convenient and comfortable Fence to ſhelter them againſt the cutting North-winds. In this caſe, if that Author reaſons juſtly, it is plain, that all theſe Facts muſt be rejected as fabulous, or mere Forgeries, becauſe they could not find, either by Obſervation, or Experience, that they had been ever incommoded by any ſuch Tree on the one Side, or had ever wanted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0177700400:47"/>
ſuch a Shelter on the other, or that ever the Gardener had been ſeen in any but one and the ſame Dreſs.</p>
               <p>But is there no Diſparity between the Facts recorded of the Gardener, and thoſe which the Sacred Writers aſcribe to the Supreme Being? Yes, doubtleſs, a vaſt one: But as the Want of Obſervation could be no ſufficient Argument againſt the Authenticity of the Facts in one Caſe, ſo neither can it be againſt that of the other, unleſs either of them can be demonſtrated to be above the Power of their reſpective Agents, or to have implied a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Contradiction. An hard Point this, one would think, to prove, with reſpect to the Deity: Let us therefore ſee now how they have ſucceeded in their Attempt to do it. But here you will, I doubt not, eaſily excuſe me, if, for Brevity and Clearneſs ſake, as well as to avoid troubling you with a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Quotations, I chooſe to link the Sum and Subſtance of all their Objections and Reaſonings, together with my Anſwer to them, in one Chain; and to contract both in one ſhort View, rather than as they lie ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Works of the Writers on both
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0177700400:48"/>
Sides of the Controverſy. And you will do me the Juſtice to think, that as I would not charge them with any thing but what is expreſsly found in their Writings, much leſs would I omit any thing they have ſaid on this important Head, that carries any Weight with it: For tho' your Antagoniſts at <hi>P.—</hi> may not perhaps carry their Oppoſition ſo far as the Authors I am going to examine; in which caſe they can eaſily diſculpate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it to you; yet would it by no means excuſe my omitting any material thing that hath been urged by others on ſo momentous a Point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then, as to that old and trite Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Miracles, that they are no proper Proofs of any Doctrine, I have already ſhewn ſome Inſtances in which they really are; and that the Raiſing of the Dead is as full and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Evidence of the Doctrine of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as any that could be poſſibly given, or reaſonably required<note n="l" place="bottom">See the Preface.</note>. Again, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cures wrought on the Blind, Lame, Lepers, Lunatics, Paralytics, and other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, were no leſs proper, as well as preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0177700400:49"/>
Proofs both of the univerſal Depravity of Mankind, and of the Guilt incurr'd by it, when the ſame miraculous Power that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them from the dire Effects of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, pronounced them abſolved from the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="m" place="bottom">

                  </note>. What greater Proof could any one require to convince him, that his Guilt or Sin was really remitted to him with reſpect to the Penalty or Puniſhment of it in the next Life, than ſuch a miraculous Deliverance from that only Part of it which was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it in this? With reſpect to the monſtrous Idolatry, and abominable Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which had over-run the greateſt Part of the heathen World, at the time when <hi>Moſes</hi> made his ſecond Appearance in <hi>Egypt,</hi> could any thing be more proper or pertinent to convince that Nation of the Abſurdity and Impiety of their worſhiping, and putting any Confidence in, the falſe Deities of their own creating, or of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Supreme Governor and Diſpoſer of all ſublunary things, than that long and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Conteſt, which he condeſcended to enter into with them; wherein every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle wrought under his Direction and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpices,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0177700400:50"/>
by his Servant, was ſo exactly levelled againſt ſome one or other of their pretended Deities, and every other Branch of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Worſhip, as will be more fully ſhewn in the next Eſſay? And if <hi>Egypt</hi> was at that time the chief Seat of Learning, from which every Branch of it, together with that vaſt Variety of Extravagancies which related to their Worſhip, flowed into moſt other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries about it, far and near; if their Prieſts and Doctors were allowed to excel all others, not only in the Knowlege of their profound and myſtic Theology, but in their Skill in Aſtronomy, Aſtrology, Natural Philoſophy, Magic, Divination, and other pretended oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Arts and Sciences; where could there be a more proper Scene for this Diſplay of his ſupreme and irreſiſtible Power, than that? What Means more likely to convince, not only <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Subjects, but all other Nations which had received their falſe Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy from thence, of the Vanity and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of their imaginary Deities, than the conſtant Defeat which was given to them at every new Tryal? What Time more proper than this for it, when the Infection was grown ſo univerſal, and become incurable by any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0177700400:51"/>
other Means, by its reigning under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Divine Sanction, whilſt thoſe who alone had the Power of ſuppreſſing, made it their Intereſt and Glory to ſupport and propagate it? Laſtly, What Occaſion more worthy of the Divine Interpoſition, than the reducing ſuch a Number of Nations from the moſt deſtructive and abominable Errors in Faith and Practice, to ſuch a Senſe of his unerring Providence, ſuch an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Will, and ſuch pure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Worſhip of him, as could alone intitle them to his Favour and Bleſſings in this, and the next Life?</p>
               <p>Hence then we may ſafely conclude, that Miracles were ſo far from being ſuch impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Evidences of God's gracious Deſign of reclaiming a degenerate World from that Multitude of Errors and Enormities, into which it was irretrievably immerged, that they appear to have been the moſt effectual, if not the only Means, that could bring about ſo deſirable a Change; as they were moſt apt to awaken the Attention of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; appealed to their rational Faculties, without offering any Violence to their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0177700400:52"/>
and gave them the ſtrongeſt Aſſurances of his over-ruling Providence over the whole Creation; and, what ſtill more nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them to know, over all thoſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Deities, whether the Luminaries, Planets, Stars, Elements, or any other miſtaken Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Worſhip and Confidence. Hence alſo we may judge, how worthy of the Divine Goodneſs and Juſtice ſuch a miraculous Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ought to appear to every ſerious Thinker, that is, not as merely calculated in Favour of the poor and deſpicable Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as our Oppoſers falſly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, but for the Benefit, both preſent and future, of the heathen World; and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, as a Part of Prelude to the grand Syſtem of the Redemption of Mankind<note n="n" place="bottom">See <hi>Grot. de Verit.

               <p>Firſt, then, with regard to the univerſal Diſaſter, which we lately obſerved had over-run the moral World, and ſtood in need of nothing leſs than the divine Interpoſition to rectify, they peremptorily object, <hi>That both the material and moral World, being alike the Production of infinite Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, cannot be otherwiſe than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, each in their Kind; and conſequently out of all Poſſibility of ever ſtanding in Need of any ſuch Interpoſition to amend it.</hi> This is one of their fundamental Axioms; which whoſoever can admit, without any farther Proof (for none they have, or can give of it), muſt of courſe give up the Cauſe of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as abſurd, and utterly exploded. What they affirm of the material World being leſs pertinent to our preſent Controverſy, I ſhall content myſelf with reminding them, that a much greater Natural Philoſopher, than they

can produce out of their Claſs, made no Scruple to declare himſelf of a contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; <hi>viz.

With reſpect to the moral World, it is no leſs certain, that two as great Moral Philoſophers, as ever Antiquity, or the World, could boaſt, were ſo far from dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing like its having been created in ſuch pretended Perfection, as to be above all Poſſibility of ever wanting the Divine Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to reform it, that one of them, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>

We may indeed ſafely leave it to them, to make out this pretended Impoſſibility of the World's ever wanting to be amended, againſt the known Sentiment of the reſt of the World, and the conſtant Experience of all Ages and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and to ſhew in what Senſe ſuch a Divine Revelation, as that we are defending, can be ſaid to amend God's original Work, except that in which a good Education, or Inſtruction, is known to do; for what doth a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation elſe, than offord Mankind a clearer and more certain Knowledge of his Divine Nature and Attributes, than bare unaſſiſted Reaſon could do, in order to render us more conformable to his Will, and to the Ends for which he made us? We may therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the moral World perfect, when every Part of it is endowed with Faculties anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe Ends. And it is in this very Senſe, that the wiſe Man<note n="r" place="bottom">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0177700400:57"/>
made Man perfect, or upright; yet adds, that they ſought out many Inventions, or, as the Original imports, vain Imaginations. He was endowed with ſufficient Faculties to know what is right or wrong, and a free Power over his own Actions; that is, of making a good or bad Uſe of thoſe Faculties; without which he would have been only a mere Piece of Machinery, inſtead of rational free Agent; and conſequently incapable of Virtue or Vice, of Reward or Puniſhment. But as this doth not exclude, but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces, the Neceſſity of Tutors to inſtruct and direct, and Monitors to encourage or deter, to reprove or reclaim Individuals, ſo much more will it do ſo with reſpect to the whole moral World. And ſince the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of every Age and Nation ſhews it to be in a continual Fluctuation, one while making vaſt Advances and Improvements in Virtue and Knowlege, and, by-and-by, ſunk into the groſſeſt Ignorance and Immorality, Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatry; if ſuch has been the State of the moral World, that the far greater Part of it hath preferred Falſhood to Truth, Vice to Virtue, Superſtition to a pure Worſhip, with what Face can theſe Pretenders to Reaſoning
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0177700400:58"/>
and Philoſophy affirm it out of all Poſſibility of wanting any Amendment? They may indeed ptonounce thoſe Diſorders to be incurable; and ſo they do, in fact, by excluding the only Means that can poſſibly rectify them. But what Reaſon can they give us, the Diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus far above all human Remedy, to believe the Divine Goodneſs too unconcerned to interpoſe, in our behalf, and furniſh us with a more ſuitable, powerful, and effectual one; <hi>viz.</hi> a more perfect Revelation of himſelf, and a Syſtem of Morality more ſuitable to his Divine Will? But here they tell us again, that we aſſume too much, when we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the diſaſtrous State of Mankind to be beyond all human Power to rectify, ſeeing <hi>the Faculties with which he hath endowed Mankind are abundantly ſufficient to recover Mankind from any Miſcarriage, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with ſuch a Syſtem of Religion and Morality, and ſuch a competent Nation of God, and his Providence, as will anſwer all the Ends of ſuch a ſuppoſed Revelation.</hi> This they poſitively affirm; and tho' none of them hath hitherto dared, as they have in other Caſes, to appeal to common Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Obſervation for the Truth of ſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0177700400:59"/>
bold an Aſſumption, they being point-blank againſt it; a ſmall Retroſpection on the brighteſt Ages of the moſt polite antient Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans, Babylonians, Greeks, Romans,</hi> &amp;c. will ſoon convince us how few there were amongſt their wiſe and learned Men, that had any true Notion either of the Deity, or of Religion and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; how fewer ſtill, thoſe who had either Credit, or Courage, to ſtem the Current of Superſtition and Degeneracy, in Compariſon of thoſe who ſuffered themſelves to be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with it; to ſay nothing of the ſmall, if not rather ill Succeſs, of ſuch an Oppoſition againſt ſuch powerful Supporters as the Civil Power, the Prieſthood, and an headſtrong Populace. Our Antagoniſts therefore, being conſcioushow little able that vain Aſſertion was to ſtand againſt two ſuch powerful Witneſſes, have thought it more expedient to endeavour to prop it up by ſome far-fetch'd Arguments, which, how inconcluſive ſoever, might at leaſt bear the ſpecious Face of Reaſoning. And firſt, they tell us, that <hi>ſuch a miraculous Revelation is inconſiſtent with God's Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, one of his moſt eſſential Attributes;</hi> that is, according to their Logic, if God is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0177700400:60"/>
immutable in his Nature, he muſt be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo in his Actions. Wild Concluſion this! and of no Force, unleſs they can alſo prove all his Creatures to be as unchangeable as himſelf, than which nothing is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Obſervation and Experience, nor more abſurd and unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, and much more ſo with reſpect to the moral World: For if the Experience of all Ages ſhews it to have been in a conſtant Fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if whole Nations appear to have ſunk from a good Pitch of Learning, to the loweſt Dregs of Ignorance; from the trueſt and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeſt Notions of the Supreme Being, and of the pure Worſhip that is due to him, to the baſeſt Degrees of Idolatry and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and from the nobleſt Sentiments of Virtue and Morality, to the moſt ſhameful Degeneracy and Corruption, both in Theory and Practice; what Reaſon can there be to ſuppoſe, much leſs to affirm ſo peremptorily, as our Oppoſers do, that a <hi>Divine Interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt neceſſarily be contrary to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability?</hi> Is it not rather more juſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that the very Immutability of his Nature and Counſels muſt incline, I might ſay, oblige him to alter his Meaſures with his Creatures,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0177700400:61"/>
as often as he ſees them deviate from, or go contrary to them, or abaſe thoſe Faculties, and that Freedom of Choice, with which he had endowed them, to Purpoſes quite oppoſite to the Ends for which he had created them? Can a Clock-maker be ſaid to change his Mind or Deſign, when he goes about mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is amiſs in a Clock; or a Phyſician, when the Irregularity of his Patient obliges him to alter his Preſcriptions, and Method of treating him, in order to his Recovery? Much more abſurd, if not impious, will it be, to infer a Mutability in the Supreme and All-wiſe Being, who, foreknowing from all Eternity all the poſſible Exigencies of his moral World, and the ill Uſe Men would make of thoſe Faculties, and the Liberty, with which he had endowed them, muſt neceſſarily be thought to have decreed likewiſe, in his eternal Counſel, a proper Supply for every Want, and Remedy for every Diſorder: So that every ſuch extraordinary Interpoſition, as we are contending for, that is, where the Subject is worthy of it, is ſo far from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying any thing like a Mutability in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as our Oppoſers would infer, that it is in Reality no other than an Effect of his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0177700400:62"/>
eternal and unalterable Decrees. I dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to appeal to every conſidering Man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Immutability, in this Senſe, is not more truly, and every way, worthy of the Divine Nature, than that which our Oppoſers attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to him, and which repreſents the whole Creation as a mere large Piece of compound Mechaniſm; which, having been once ſet in Motion by its Maker, is left to go on its own Way, without any farther Care or Regard from him, notwithſtanding that great Variety of Diſorders and Irregularities which is ſeen and felt in our moral Part of it?</p>
               <p>But here, again, we are ſtrangely ſtopped on the ſudden, and are boldly arraigned, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining too high Notions of the Divine Nature and Attributes; and all our Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, from the Effects to the Cauſe, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing thoſe Perfections to the latter, in an infinite Degree, which we obſerve in the former, is, it ſeems, all falſe Logic: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Degrees of Wiſdom, Juſtice, Goodneſs, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we aſcribe to the Creator, <hi>beyond what hath immediately fallen under our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation on the Works of Nature, being all together unſupported by any Reaſon or</hi>

                     <hi>Hume Eſſay,</hi> xi. p. 228.</note>. So that, according to this Author's Reaſoning (which is, for Form's ſake, put into the Mouth of an <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philoſopher, ſuppoſed to defend his Doctrine before an <hi>Athenian</hi> Senate), as many as have aſcribed <hi>any higher, or any other kind of Attributes or Perfections, to the Deity, than actually appear to have been exerted to the full, in his Works, have been guilty of Flattery and Panegyric, rather than Maſters of juſt Reaſoning and Philoſophy; which can never be able to carry us beyond the uſual Courſe of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, or give us different Meaſures of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Behaviour from thoſe which are furniſhed by Reflection on common Life</hi>

Whence we are taught theſe two ſpecial Leſſons; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, to take care, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how we launch out in the Praiſes of the Supreme Creator, at that extraordinary rate the greateſt Divines, and Moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, have hitherto done, ſeeing the Notion of his infinite Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no better than abſurd Nonſenſe, an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0177700400:64"/>
Contradiction to Experience and Reaſon; the one plainly ſhewing, that he never did, and the other, that it is impoſſible for him ever to exert any of his Perfections or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, were they ever ſo truly infinite, in any ſuch Degree as we may ſafely pronounce to be ſuch, from any effectual Appearance, or Impreſſion, they can make upon a finite Mind: The other Leſſon we may learn from it is, not to ſuffer ourſelves to be any more impoſed upon, by any Pretence, how ſpecious ſoever, that he ever did, or ever will, interpoſe his Power, or furniſh us with any new Means to amend his moral World; ſince, if our Author's Logic is good, we have no Reaſon or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to convince us, that, bad or corrupt as it may appear to us, it is not in as good and perfect Condition as he could, or knew how to, make it; and the contrary Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that he might, if he would, is at beſt but mere <hi>Conjecture and Hypotheſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall readily leave it to him to make the moſt of all this bold aſſuming Stuff againſt the cleareſt and moſt convincing Reaſonings of thoſe great Divines, and learned Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who have hitherto argued in Defence
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0177700400:65"/>
of God's infinite Perfection. If ſuch dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Aſſertions as his may paſs for Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations with any Set of Men, not only the Notion of the divine Attributes, but that of the divine Nature, may be in ſome Danger of dwindling into a mere imaginary Shadow, in their Eſtimation: And we may plainly ſee, by the Topics they have hitherto made uſe of, to explode the bare Poſſibility of its interpoſing in human Affairs, upon any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or Exigence whatſoever, how much they have already ventured to ſink it below the Mark to which moſt other Schools, except their own, had ſo univerſally raiſed it.</p>
               <p>But ſince this Author not only makes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Obſervation the ſole Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone by which we may judge of the Truth of any hiſtorical Facts, but ſeems to engroſs the ſole Property and Evidence to his own Side, whilſt he abſolutely excludes ours from challenging any Benefit from it, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe we challenge in Defence of the divine Revelation are of a miraculous Kind, it will not be improper here to examine which of the Two hath the better Claim to it, even according to his way of Reaſoning:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0177700400:66"/>
For if that Experience may be moſt ſafely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, which is founded upon the beſt Teſtimony, it is plain, that ours hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ampleſt, the moſt poſitive, unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, and univerſal, from Friends and Foes, and been confirmed by other authentic Monuments, in Proof of the Miracles recorded in our ſacred Books<note n="u" place="bottom">

                  </note>; whereas all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Experience he objects againſt them, being of the negative Kind, and implying no more than a Want of Experience and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and not a Contrariety to it, can never be allowed to outweigh the Evidence of a ſingle well-atteſted Teſtimony, much leſs of ſuch a Number and Variety of them as we allege againſt him. This he could not but be ſenſible of; and that, as he could not object any thing againſt the Sufficiency of them, either on account of their Paucity, or of the Character of the Witneſſes, but what had been fully anſwered long ago, and by many able Pens, he muſt likewiſe think, that his conſining his negative Experience to ſuch Periods of Time, in which no ſuch divine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0177700400:67"/>
Interpoſitions were become unneceſſary, and, conſequently, could not fall under our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, is but a weak Argument againſt the Credibility of their having been diſplayed in former ones; when the Exigencies of the moral World did more immediately require them, and the Occaſion of them was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether worthy of them. And when could there be a more worthy one, than when Mankind were not only ſunk into the moſt diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Notions of the Deity, and the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Rites in his Worſhip; but had even degenerated ſo far, as to ſhelter them under the Sanction of his Authority and Inſtitution, barring up by that means, all poſſible Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues againſt Conviction, and rendering the Diſtemper incurable by any other Means, but that of a new Revelation of himſelf, and his divine Will? If in ſuch a Caſe we have ſufficient Teſtimony, that the divine Providence interpoſed, and, by a long Series of Miracles the moſt appoſite, ſtrove to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were the firſt Broachers and Propagators of that deteſtable Theology and Worſhip, of the Vanity of their falſe Deities, the Impiety of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Rites, and of his alone and abſolute
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0177700400:68"/>
Superintendency over all his Creatures (and our Author is not above ſuppoſing, that <hi>the Teſtimony for thoſe Miracles, conſidered apart, and in itſelf, may amount to a full Proof),</hi> I would gladly know of what Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his negative Experience of latter Ages, when no ſuch Exigence called for them, can be, againſt that of the former ones, when there was ſuch a viſible Neceſſity for them? Or how the want of Obſervation in the former can invalidate the Teſtimony which we have of their having been ſo frequent, and ſo ſignal, in the latter? At this rate of Reaſoning, an Inhabitant of <hi>Lower Egypt</hi> muſt never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and other Countries, enjoy the Benefit of the former and latter Rain, let ever ſo many credible Eye-witneſſes aſſure him of it; becauſe ſuch a Bleſſing is ſeldom or never obſerved in his own: And, for the ſame wiſe Reaſon, thoſe that live within the Tropics, ought not, on any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to believe that there is either Snow or Ice without, becauſe there is no ſuch Thing to be ſeen within them: And one-half of the Moon's Globe muſt not believe, that our Earth is a Planet to it, becauſe it can never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0177700400:69"/>
by thoſe of that Side, by reaſon of its being conſtantly turned from us.</p>
               <p>But here it may be asked, How doth all this affect our Author's Argument, drawn from Non-experience, and Non-obſervation, againſt Teſtimony? which is not here le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled againſt a few rare Phaenomena of Nature, but againſt Miracles, which are a plain Deviation from, or (as he pleaſes to ſtile them) a Violation of, the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Is not this ſingle Conſideration ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſcredit it, and explode the bare Poſſibility of them, againſt any Teſtimony whatever, <hi>tho', conſidered apart, and in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, amounting to a full Proof?</hi> I grant that the Charge of Violation of Nature's Laws, were Miracles really ſuch, as is here ſo boldly affirmed, carries an Abſurdity ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any thinking Perſon from admitting the bare Possibility of it, let who will be Violator of them, whether the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of thoſe Laws, or any other ſubordinate Power. But here the Abſurdity lies, in the Suppoſition of either being poſſibly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with it; for in what Senſe can the former be poſſibly taxed with violating his own Laws, whenever he ſees fit, for Motives
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0177700400:70"/>
worthy of himſelf, to ſuſpend or diſpenſe with them? Or how can the latter, who only act as Inſtruments under him, and by his ſole Direction and Power? That Nature would act conſtantly, and uniformly, to the Laws that were firſt impreſſed upon it by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, is out of all Queſtion; but what leſs, than being of his own eternal Council, or having it revealed to him, can embolden any Creature to affirm, or even imagine, that he diveſted himſelf of all Power of ever ſuſpending, or diſpenſing with them, upon any Occaſion whatſoever? much leſs, that ſuch a Suſpenſion of, or diſpenſing with, was a Violation of them; eſpecially as we ſtill ſee the ſame Laws conſtantly obſerved in every Inſtance, but where the Exigencies of the moral World rendered ſuch a caſual Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition neceſſary or expedient: In which caſe in cannot be deemed any other than an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his divine Wiſdom and Preſcience, and a Part of his eternal Decrees, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to it, as I obſerved a little higher to you.</p>
               <p>Here, again, therefore, the Author laſt-quoted hath greatly overſhot himſelf in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

from interpoſing in the extraordinary and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Way we are told, from ſufficient Teſtimony, he did in favour of his moral World, eſpecially as that was the only one conſiſtent with the Liberty of rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that could poſſibly reclaim it, and the doing of it, by ſuch means, every way wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the divine Goodneſs and Wiſdom.</p>

That if God be ſuppoſed to have thus mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly interpoſed his divine Power in any Age, or to have made uſe of that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Method, to reveal his Will to any People, he muſt of courſe be concluded to do ſo in all Ages, and towards all Nations: So that, according to their Way of Reaſoning, if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were ever neceſſary or expedient to anſwer any of the Deſigns of the divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, they muſt be ever ſo; becauſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Nature of Things, or the Laws of Nature, be allowed to be changeable, or not, yet God, being unchangeable in his Nature, muſt ſtill purſue the ſame Methods, whether we allow the State of the moral World to require it or no; that is, in other Words, if God ever wrought any Miracles, when the State of Mankind made them expedient or neceſſary, he cannot but continue ſo work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, when they ceaſe to be ſo. This Inference, wild as it is, they draw not only from his Immutability, which hath been already proved to be out of the preſent Caſe; but back it by another Argument, no leſs aſſuming and inconcluſive; <hi>viz.</hi> That he cannot ceaſe to do ſo, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chargeable with Partiality towards one Age or Nation, above another. I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0177700400:75"/>
reflecting on the Boldneſs of ſuch a Charge, as well as on the Preſumption of theſe Writers, who dare thus freely to cavil at the Counſels of infinite Wiſdom; which, extending to all Ages, cannot but be above all poſſible Comprehenſion: Let it ſuffice to obſerve here, that as God will ever act with the ſame unalterable Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Juſtice, towards his Creatures, ſo he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſplay the ſame miraculous Interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whenever the State and Circumſtances of the moral World make it expedient or requiſite; but at no other time doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he muſt or can do ſo, becauſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Confeſſion, he can do nothing in vain. That he condeſcended to act in this miraculous manner, upon ſome particular Occaſions, at ſome particular Times, when nothing leſs than ſuch an extraordinary Interpoſition, could reduce Mankind from thoſe Enormities into which it was plunged, both with regard to their Religion and Morals, as both were then eſtabliſhed and upheld by the civil and prieſtly Power, and under the Pretence of the divine Sanction, we have ſuch ſufficient Evidence, as they have not been able hitherto to overthrow. But after he had, by a long Series of Wonders, made
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0177700400:76"/>
ſo ample a Manifeſtation of his Will, Nature, Attributes, given them the moſt ſenſible Proofs both of his over-ruling Power, and of his high Diſpleaſure at their abominable ſuperſtitious Idolatries, inhuman Rites, by the ſevereſt Puniſhment of thoſe whom the milder Diſplays of his Arm could not ſoften into an Acknowlegement of his Almighty Power and Sovereignty, as in the Inſtance of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> of which ſee the next Eſſay; laſtly, after he had cauſed thoſe Wonders to be recorded in ſuch inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Characters, both under the <hi>Moſaic</hi> and much more ſo under the Chriſtian Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; where could there be any occaſion for renewing and repeating them in every Age and Nation, when the Memory of them, if duly preſerved, was of itſelf ſufficient to anſwer all the Ends for which they had been wrought? Now, that they have been ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the ſacred Records of the Old and New Teſtament, the frequent and vain Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and illuſory Shifts, the Oppoſers have hitherto uſed to diſcredit thoſe ſacred Books, in which they are recorded, would of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves afford us a ſufficient Proof, had we no other Evidence of their divine Authority, or were thoſe Facts which they relate deſtitute
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0177700400:77"/>
of that Cloud of Teſtimonies which we have of them, from all Antiquity, and from Foes, as well as Friends, of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Revelation. But I have already ſaid enough on this Head; and may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to reſume and back it with ſome freſh Proofs, in ſome of the following Eſſays. But before I take my Leave of them, and the Subject of Miracles, I cannot paſs by a new illuſory Argument, or rather an old one, in a new Dreſs, they have ſtarted to invalidate this preſſing Teſtimony we urge againſt them; eſpecially, becauſe it may, tho' a poor one, chance to impoſe on ſuch of their Readers as are either byaſſed in their Favour, or too indolent to look beyond the Surface of it. One of the laſt Writers gives it to us, in Words to this Purpoſe: Moſt Religions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther antient or modern, and how different ſoever from one another, were at firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on the like pretended Evidence of Miracles; which, if of any Weight, would argue them to be all alike true, and to ſtand alike on a ſolid Foundation; which yet muſt appear to be abſolutely impoſſible, to every one who conſiders their vaſt Contrariety. To make this Aſſertion appear more plauſible,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0177700400:78"/>
we are reminded of an <hi>Apollonius Tya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> at <hi>Rome, a Simon Magus</hi> at <hi>Samaria,</hi> an <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> a <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and many others, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to have wrought much the ſame Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which are urged in Confirmation of the Chriſtian Revelation.

               <p>By this time, I hope I have ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all the Objections which have been hitherto raiſed againſt the Reality and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Miracles; and by that means cleared, in ſome meaſure, the way to the ſubſequent Eſſays; in which I am to remove the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which your neighbouring Antagoniſts urge againſt thoſe which were wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And if the Subject I have been upon hath been ſo far exhauſted, by much better Hands, that it was ſcarcely poſſible for me to add any new Thing to it, I hope you'll find the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ones treated in a more untrite, tho' no leſs clear and ſatisfactory way, than they have hitherto been: And if I have taken the Liberty to ſuſpend the taking Notice of thoſe

               </opener>
               <p>THE Text, you may remember, runs thus: <hi>For I will paſs through the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>this Night, and will ſmite all the Firſt-born in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>both Man and Beaſt; and againſt all the Gods of</hi> Egypt <hi>will I execute Judgments. I am the Lord.</hi> But what is meant by <hi>the Gods of Egypt,</hi> and in what manner this <hi>Judgment was executed upon them</hi> by God, is what hath hitherto been variouſly, and, I may add, unſatisfactorily accounted for, by all the Expoſitors I have hitherto met with; ſome of them interpreting the Words <hi>Elohe Mizraim,</hi> the Gods of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of the Princes or Rulers of that Nation, which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Scriptures ſtiled Gods (Pſal. lxxxii. 6) and who, following their King in his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> periſhed with him, and his Hoſt, in the <hi>Red Sea:</hi> Others underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word <hi>Elohim</hi> to mean no more than the <hi>Idols,</hi> which they carried about with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0177700400:84"/>
them in their Armies on all ſuch Emergencies, and which were all ſwallowed up by the Waves on that remarkable Night. In this Senſe, the antient <hi>Jews,</hi> and particularly the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> underſtood it; and the latter ſubjoins the following Remark upon the extraordinary Completion of that threatened Judgment, <hi>That the Idol which is made with Hands is curſed, as well as he that made it, being both alike hateful to God, and both deſerving to be puniſhed by him: Therefore,</hi> adds he, <hi>upon the Idols of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhall there be a Viſitation, becauſe the Creature of God is made thereby to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Abomination, and a Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block, to the Souls of Men, a Snare to the Feet of the Unwiſe, the Occaſion of ſpiritual Fornication, and of the Corruption of Mens Lives.</hi> Wiſd. xiv. 8-12.</p>
               <p>But whoever ſeriouſly weighs the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Dignity, and Deſign, of this whole miraculous Tranſaction, will hardly allow either of thoſe Interpretations to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to, or worthy of, ſuch a ſolemn and dreadful Denunciation. Firſt, Not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it, becauſe this Judgment was to be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0177700400:85"/>
executed not at the fatal Deſtruction of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> but on the ſame Night in which all the Firſt-born of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were to be miraculouſly cut off. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Not worthy of it, becauſe, from the very Tenour of it, it plainly appears to be levelled againſt ſomething greater than Princes or Magiſtrates, who were to be alike Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with the reſt of the People in the Loſs of their Firſt-born, from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> their haughty Monarch, down to the loweſt Slave in his Dominions; and much leſs can it be ſuppoſed to have been levelled againſt their dumb and ſenſeleſs Idols. The Words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which we tranſlate, <hi>I will execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or rather <hi>Judgments,</hi> as the Text hath it, muſt mean ſomething of an higher Nature than the bare drowning of their Rulers or Idols in the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> and the Words <hi>Ani Jehovah,</hi> which conclude the Verſe, and which we tranſlate, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> but may be more properly rendered, I, even I, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or the Supreme Being, <hi>will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it,</hi> plainly ſhew, that nothing leſs here is threatened, than the whole Colluvies of falſe <hi>Egyptian</hi> Deities, as they ſtand juſtly oppoſed to the true and only God, whom
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0177700400:86"/>
                  <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had hitherto refuſed to acknowlege, notwithſtanding the Variety of Miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> had already wrought in his Name, and ſuch as the very <hi>Magicians</hi> had been forced to own were wrought by the only Finger of the Supreme Being.</p>
               <p>But to make this, and what I am farther to ſay, in order to diſplay the genuine Senſe of the Text in Queſtion, ſtill plainer, it will be neceſſary to take the Matter a little higher, and make ſome previous Remarks on the Nature and Deſign of this divine and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Diſpenſation, from the Account which the inſpired <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lawgiver hath given us of it; and from which it will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that tho the Deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their preſent dreadful Thraldom ſeems to be the main Point in View; yet God had ſtill a much higher and nobler Deſign in it, namely, to convince not only the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> now more immediately concerned in it, but by that means all other Nations, far and near, of theſe three important Truths; <hi>viz.</hi> I. That the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whom the <hi>Hebrews</hi> worſhiped, was the Supreme Being, the Creator, and ſole Governor and Diſpoſer, of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0177700400:87"/>
all Things. 2. That all the other pretended Deities, which either the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or any other heathen Nations, worſhiped, as Mediators and Benefactors, whether the celeſtial Bodies, Angels, Demons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were either Fictions of their own Brain, or, at beſt, Beings created by him, and intirely ſubordinate to his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power and Diſpoſal. And, 3. That the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> now groaning under their ſevere Servitude, were the peculiar People of that one only Supreme and Almighty Being; in conſequence of which he ſent <hi>Pharaoh</hi> this ſpecial Meſſage, and abſolute Command, to let them go and ſerve him, under the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Penalty, in caſe of Refuſal, of being made to feel the moſt ſevere Effects of his Anger and Reſentment. This laſt is plainly implied in thoſe Words of God to <hi>Moſes</hi>

<p>As to the time of this Invaſion, <hi>S. Marſham</hi> places it 157 Years before the Exod; and Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> ſoon after the Time of <hi>Joſhua</hi> entering into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>

any of the Monarchs of <hi>Lower Egypt,</hi> and, we may add, of any other heathen Nation, would, upon the like Occaſion, have behaved in the very ſame manner; eſpecially as it was backed with no better Authority than that of the Meſſenger's bare Word. However, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was of <hi>Egyptian,</hi> or any other Race; and whether the Meaning of his Anſwer was, that he did not know or acknowlege ſuch a Supreme Deity; or that he did not believe this pretended God of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to be Him; it plainly appears by the whole Tenour of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Commiſſion and Miracles, that God's Deſign was to convince him, and his People, of both thoſe important Truths, by ſuch infallible Signs as ſhould at once extort from him a free Confeſſion of them, and an infallible Compliance with the Divine Command.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Point which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were to be made ſenſible of, by this Divine Meſſage, and which is but a natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the firſt, was, that all the other pretended Deities, both of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and other heathen Nations, whether Angels, Demons, and the like, or the Stars and Planets,

But this Doctrine, reaſonable and juſt as it was in itſelf, could not but meet with the moſt ſtrenuous Oppoſition, not only from the heathen Prieſts, but from the Laity too, conſidering that Polytheiſm had then over-run the greateſt Part of the World; and that <hi>Lower Egypt</hi> was, at that time, ſo overſtocked with thoſe imaginary Deities, and ſo ſtupidly fond of that ſuperſtitious Sort of Worſhip, that they had altogether forgot that of the Supreme Being, if not the very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him; inſomuch that we are told<note n="i" place="bottom">

But theſe few will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſhew, at once, where this Notion of Polytheiſm had its Origin, and what ready and univerſal Reception it met with every-where: And this raiſed the Reputation of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts and Sages to ſuch an Height, that thoſe of other Nations, not content with what had been brought to them from hence by others, were eager to travel
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0177700400:96"/>
thither, in order to be ſtill more deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in their Myſteries, Rites, and other Branches of Learning, for which they were no leſs famous.

And this Notion was accordingly ſo univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that whatever the Learned of other Nations met with in it, that ſeemed to ſhock their Reaſon, they readily choſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome deep Myſtery to be wrapped up in it, rather than to think that any thing, either abſurd or unreaſonable, could poſſibly be contained in the Religion of ſo wiſe a People; not conſidering, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> rightly obſerves<note n="q" place="bottom">

introducing, inſtead of one only Supreme, Almighty, and All-wiſe Being, an infinite Number and Variety of inferior Deities; and ſinking into ſuch a Degree of Folly and Depravity, as to worſhip not only all the celeſtial Bodies, Angels, Demons, Heroes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but even Beaſts, Fowls, Reptiles, and Plants; whilſt, on the other hand, they ſuffered their Pride to ſwell to ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Height, as to challenge an extravagant Antiquity above all other Nations, and to pretend to have been governed by a long Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods and Demigods, above 34,000 Years before <hi>Menes,</hi> their firſt Monarch of human Race. Theſe were the boaſted Sages whom <hi>Moſes</hi> was, now, not only to enter the Liſts with (for their Monarchs ſeldom, if ever, did or reſolved any thing of Moment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out previouſly conſulting them), but was to convince, by irrefragable Proofs, that all the boaſted Variety of Deities, which they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped, were mere Deluſions of their own Brain, an Impoſition upon Mankind, or, at the moſt, that they were only Beings created by, and wholly ſubordinate to, the great and only God <hi>Jehovah;</hi> in whoſe Name, and by whoſe expreſs Orders, he was ſent to demand the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0177700400:98"/>

Well might <hi>Pharaoh</hi> tell the Meſſenger, that he knew of no ſuch an over-ruling Power as he ſpoke to him of; which was a thing he never heard of, and point-blank oppoſite to the then <hi>Egyptian</hi> Theology: For if any of the wiſer Sort of his Prieſts or Magicians had any Notion left of a Supreme Being, as many of the Philoſophers of other Nations had; yet the Belief of his having transferred the Care of all ſublunary Things to the Stars, Planets, and other inferior Deities, prevailed ſo far every-where, that it had quite obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated that of his over-ruling Providence.

But to return to the true and real Intent of the Divine Providence in this wonderful Conteſt between its commiſſioned Meſſenger and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, and his Magicians; we have already ſeen how <hi>Egypt</hi> was at this time not only immerged in the ſtrangeſt, and moſt monſtrous Polytheiſm, but had likewiſe infected moſt other Nations, far and near, with it; and, I might have added, that a great Number of inhuman and unnatural Rites had alſo been gradually introduced into the Worſhip of thoſe falſe Deities, which were deſtructive of common Society, and a Scandal to human Nature itſelf<note n="D" place="bottom">It hath indeed been queſtioned, whether the Worſhip of the <hi>Egyptians, Canaanites, &amp;c.</hi> had any ſuch abominable Rites, at leaſt ſo early as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, if at all; and I muſt own, it is not eaſy to fix the time when they were firſt introduced among them.

For this was plainly hinted to <hi>Moſes</hi> from the Beginning; <hi>Go, and tell</hi> Pharaoh, Iſrael <hi>is my Son, my Firſt-born; and if thou refuſe to let him go, behold, I will ſlay thy Son, even thy Firſt-born</hi>

And it is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able here, that the <hi>threatened Judgments on the Gods of</hi> Egypt, which never were once mentioned before, are now joined together with the Death of the Firſt-born; as if the laſt was to be no other than the effectual Completion of the former: For, ſays God<note n="r" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxxxv. 5, <hi>and</hi> 6.</note>. But, to make this appear ſtill plainer to every unbiaſſed Reader, let us now take a ſhort Review of the Deſign and Management of this whole Tranſaction.</p>
               <p>And, firſt, Let it be remembred, that the Deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their long and hard Bondage, was only deſigned by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to be ſubſervient to a much nobler one; that of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Nations, from their ſtrange Ignorance, or, at beſt, baſe and unworthy Notions, of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being; from their vain and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confidence in their falſe Deities, and the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0177700400:121"/>
more deteſtable Rites they uſed in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of them, in order to reduce and allure them, by degrees, to the true primitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, from which they were ſo ſcandalouſly degenerated. It was to this End that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> of whom God made Choice to be the Reviver of it, was called out of his idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Country and Kindred; and that both he, and his two immediate Deſcendants, <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> were made to wander through ſeveral Parts of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and thence at laſt into <hi>Egypt,</hi> in order to ſow the Seeds of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came. It was to confirm their Faith, and encourage their Obedience, that God was pleaſed ſo frequently to appear to them, to bleſs and protect them in ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a Manner, and to allure them by ſtill greater Promiſes. Laſtly, It was with the ſame gracious View, that God ſhewed ſuch ſignal Favours to, and heaped ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Bleſſings upon them; to the end that the People among whom they lived, ſeeing a Set of Strangers, who profeſſed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion point-blank oppoſite to theirs, and which conſiſted chiefly in acknowleging one only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, relying upon one only Mediator between God and Man, and profeſſing an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0177700400:122"/>
Abhorrence for all their falſe Gods, and their ſtill more deteſtable Worſhip of them, to be ſuch Favourites of Heaven, above all the reſt of human Race, might the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually be weaned from their vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in, and execrable Worſhip of, their imaginary Deities; and be allured by degrees to look up to that almighty and all-benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Creator, as the ſole Diſpenſer of all Bleſſings; for other than temporal ones they ſcarcely dreamed of; and ſuch they were, of which theſe Worſhipers of the true God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them to have the far larger Share<note n="u" place="bottom">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0177700400:123"/>
with a foreign Enemy againſt them, they found themſelves obliged to doom them to the moſt inhuman Thraldom; which brought on the till then unheard of Series of Wonders, and fearful Puniſhments, which ended in, and haſtened, their glorious Deliverance.</p>
               <p>I have already obſerved, that <hi>Egypt</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably made Choice of by God for the Scene of this wonderful Diſplay of his Divine Power, as it was the Parent and Nurſe of all the falſe Deities, and ſuperſtitious Idolatry, that had been tranſplanted thence into a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Nations, far and near. And it might be much more ſo, on account of the great Name it then bore, both for being the Inventreſs, and for exceeding all others, in the Art of Magic, Divination, Inchanting, and other ſuch conjuring Knowlege; which was, at that time, and long after, eſteemed as the higheſt Pitch of Learning, and human Wiſdom<note n="y" place="bottom">

                     <p>Much leſs can this Art have conſiſted in a greater Skill in the Nature, Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Motion, of the heavenly Bodies: For tho'they believed them all, as well as the Elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be endued with peculiar Intelligences; by which theſe Magicians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to perform great Feats, to foretel Events, and the like; as being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to govern the World<note n="9" place="bottom">

So that if his Magicians, who were commonly the Prieſts, and ſacred Scribes, could not ſtand this Competition, but were ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly defeated in every Inſtance of it, there
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0177700400:126"/>
could be no room for ſuppoſing, that thoſe of any other Nation could have been more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions only two Magicians who withſtood <hi>Moſes; viz. Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="bottom">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 8.</note>: Theſe two were perhaps the two Chiefs of that Sect, and are celebrated as ſuch by the <hi>Talmud,</hi> under the Names of <hi>Juchani</hi> and <hi>Mamri;</hi> and by <hi>Pliny,</hi> as the Founders of the magic Sect in Conjunction with <hi>Moſes</hi>

                  <note n="b" place="bottom">Targum Jonath. in loc.</note>. But, without laying too much Streſs upon thoſe Authors, we may well aſſure ourſelves, that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monarch would ſpare neither Pains nor Coſt, to procure the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Maſters of the Art upon ſo ſingular an Emergency; nor neglect any other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to prevent being impoſed upon by the two <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chiefs. Neither can it be ſuppoſed, that the Divine Providence, which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0177700400:127"/>
directed the Whole to ſo wiſe and gracious an End, would ſuffer any thing to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that could leave any room to doubt of his being that only true and almighty God, whom <hi>Pharaoh</hi> refuſed to acknowledge; and that he was too righteous to puniſh him for his Diſobedience, before he had given full Conviction of his ſupreme Authority over the whole Creation.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the Conteſt proceeds gradually on between <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Magicians, and in ſuch a manner, that the former hath viſibly the Advantage over the latter. Both turn their Rods into Serpents at the firſt Trial, and that of <hi>Aaron</hi> ſwallows up all the reſt: And this perhaps is not without its particular Meaning; that as the Serpent was ever look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the Emblem of Wiſdom and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note n="c" place="bottom">

                     <p>This was likely to have proved the Caſe, when their <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Governor above-mentioned firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſuppreſs it: For that River not riſing on the next Year to its uſual Mark, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one proving ſtill worſe, the People were all ready to revolt, and tear him in Pieces: Upon which he perſuaded them, <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to accompany him to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Mountain; and there exhorted them to ſtrive, by fervent Prayers to God, to obtain the Bleſſing they wanted: And on the next Morning they were congratulated with the joyful News, that the River had riſen in that Night twelve full Pikes. It continued doing ſo during the reſt of the time; and that Year was bleſſed with ſuch extraordinary Plenty, that whenever its Waters are like to fail, they have had ever ſince recourſe to that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and to their Prayers, inſtead of their inhuman Sacrifices<note n="4" place="bottom">

               <p>Here then was one of their chief Deities fairly tried and condemned, in two ſuch Inſtances, as might have convinced the ſenſeleſs <hi>Egyptians,</hi> how eaſily that River, in which they placed ſo great a Confidence, and which they looked upon as one of their

greateſt Bleſſings, could be turned into the greateſt Curſe, by the bare Stroke of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Rod; and that nothing but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power could reſtore it to its native Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Fecundity<note n="g" place="bottom">

               <p>The fourth Trial was that of the Lice; a Trial, to all Appearance, as eaſy, if not more ſo, to be imitated, than any of the former; but in which, however, they are ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly foiled, that they make no Difficulty to own their Impotence and Diſappointment to be the Effect of a Divine Power<note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. Verſe</hi> 19.</note>. Hence ſome Divines have been induced to believe, that this ſmall Vermin was a new Kind of Creature, and out of the Power of any but God to produce; whereas the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle here chiefly conſiſted in reſtraining the Power of thoſe Magicians from working a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, every whit as eaſy as thoſe they had done before; and thereby forcing them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege that ſuperior Power, or, as they expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the King, the Finger of God, which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0177700400:132"/>
was the Cauſe of it; by which both he and they might ſee, that what they had hitherto performed was chiefly owing to his Divine Permiſſion, beyond which they found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to go. And this the Magicians ſo readily acknowleged, that we do not find, that the King made any farther Trial of their Art, or that they intermeddled any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Conteſt.</p>
               <p>However, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians appeared ſo little affected by the Advantage which <hi>Moſes</hi> had hitherto gain'd over them in it, that there is Reaſon to think he did not believe them, if he did not indeed ſuſpect them to have been privately drawn in to act in concert with the two <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chiefs, it was requiſite that the ſucceeding Plagues ſhould be of a more pungent and awakening Nature; and, by falling on the Magicians, as well as the reſt of the People, remove all poſſible Suſpicion of any latent Juggle or Confederacy. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the next was that of the Swarm of Flies, which, by their poiſonous Sting, ſo terribly annoyed both Man and Beaſt, that the Air was now as much infected with them, as the Earth and Water had been by the

But what was ſtill more ſingular and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in this new one was, that thoſe little poiſonous Inſects were directed to make a Difference between the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Canton of <hi>Goſhen;</hi> ſo that they had no more Power to annoy an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> than to ſpare an <hi>Egyptian:</hi> And this ſo plainly ſhewed them to be ſent by an angry God, and not by Chance or Art, that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſiſt ſuch an Evidence, conſents to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go and ſacrifice to their God, if he will but vouchſafe to rid him of this Plague<note n="k" place="bottom">

By this time, therefore, the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whom we may reaſonably ſuppoſe to have applied in vain to all their fanſied Deities for Help, muſt be fully convinced of their Impotence, and their own Stupidity, in place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Confidence in them; as well as of the Vanity of their ſo much boaſted Skill in the magic Art, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which had ſo egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly failed them in this important Conteſt. Neither can we well queſtion but <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Confeſſion came from his Heart, when he ſaid to <hi>Moſes, I have ſinned againſt the Lord your God, and againſt you—Intreat the Lord for me, that he may remove this only one dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Plague more from me, and I will diſmiſs you</hi>

                  </note>. But here it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that tho' the Confeſſion was the Effect of a full Conviction; yet the Promiſe being rather extorted from him by the preſent Smart, the one was no ſooner removed, than
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0177700400:137"/>
the other muſt of courſe have proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, till rouſed again by a freſh and more efficacious Stroke.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the very next proves a more dreadful and awakening one than any of the former; as it extended itſelf beyond the four Elements, even to the celeſtial Bodies, and more particularly over the two grand Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, which were worſhiped by the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> as the chief and moſt powerful of all their Deities, and as the immediate Vicegerents of their great <hi>Eneph,</hi> or ſupreme Being<note n="y" place="bottom">

                  </note>; yet to be on the ſudden deprived of their chearful Light; to be doomed to a ſtrange and diſmal Night, not only ſix times as long as the common ones, but which was made ſtill more ſo, by the Horror that reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every-where, muſt appear to them more extraordinary and dreadful, than if they had ſtood ſtill over their Heads; becauſe it was not now a bare Privation of Light, but a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0177700400:138"/>
Darkneſs that might be felt<note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> x. 21, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>; and that, in ſuch a Degree, that they had neither Power nor Will to ſtir out of their Places: So that being left wholly to the Horror of their Thoughts, they either imagined thoſe Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, together with the whole Train of celeſtial Bodies, to be totally extinguiſhed; or that the whole Creation was returning to its original <hi>Chaos.</hi> Now they had Leiſure to reflect upon all the former Puniſhments they had undergone, and to think, with awful Dread, how punctually the Lord God of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had fulfilled all that <hi>Moſes</hi> had foretold to them; and how ineffectual all their Addreſſes to their numerous Deities had been, towards averting or removing any of his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. They are now convinced, to their Coſt, that this Lord is, as <hi>Moſes</hi> truly ſaid, the only ſupreme Being, to whoſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Will all things are forced to ſubmit; but dare not apply to him for Mercy, for fear of incenſing his Anger ſtill more againſt them. The only Remedy that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his People can think of, to ſupport them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their heavy Load of Dread, is to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to appeaſe it, both by an immediate
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0177700400:139"/>
Compliance with his Command, and by the moſt earneſt Intreaties, and generous Preſents, to prevail upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to intercede for them, and to obtain them that Pardon from God, which they dared not aſk for themſelves.</p>
               <p>This, at leaſt, appears by the Sequel, to have been the Reſult of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s moody Thoughts, during the Time of this long and dreadful Night. He had indeed more than once intreated <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to intercede with God for him<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid. int. al.

In this Perplexity both he and his People are joyfully ſurpriſed with the Return of the wiſhed for Light; and <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> are once more ſent for, to be informed, that he, and his whole Nation, both ſmall and great, are at full Liberty to depart; only their Cattle are to ſtay behind, as a Security for their Return. But upon

their abſolute Refuſal to comply with this laſt Condition, for which they gave him a ſufficient Reaſon<note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> x. 25.</note>, the haughty Monarch falls into an indecent Fury with them; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them to be gone, and, under Pain of Death, never to ſee his Face more: And <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> retires from him, with a Promiſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his Command<note n="d" place="bottom">

               <p>Thus far the Competition had been carried on, with the moſt evident and ſenſible Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in every Inſtance; either with reſpect to their boaſted magic Art, or to the pretended Power of all their Deities. There is not now the leaſt room left to doubt of the Lord God of the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> being the only ſupreme and abſolute Governor of All; and every Stroke of his ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Arm falls heavier and heavier on that infatuated and idolatrous Nation; and yet <hi>Pharaoh</hi> refuſes to yield, and will rather run the Riſque of a new and ſeverer Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than let the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> take their Cattle with them. And no Wonder he ſhould ſtill continue obſtinate, ſeeing the greateſt of all

his Crimes remained unpuniſhed by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge of Heaven and Earth; namely, the Murder of ſo many innocent <hi>Hebrews,</hi> whom the Tyrant had cauſed to be deſtroyed as ſoon as born; and which was to be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated now by the Deſtruction of all the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Firſt-born. For as the Dooming of thoſe Innocents to immediate Death, was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Thraldom and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and that which brought on their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; ſo the miraculous Slaughter of the Firſt-born was to give the final Stroke to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tyranny, and haſten the total Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Hoſt, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſoon after.

                     <p>That, during the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Oeconomy, the Firſt-born, or Heads of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Family, were alſo the Prieſts of it, is too plain to need any Proof: From which we may reaſonably infer, that this Hierarchy was of Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Noah,</hi> as ſuch, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the ſmall Remains that were ſaved with him in the Ark<note n="1" place="bottom">

                     <p>It is therefore more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe, that this Hierarchy, as the moſt rational, convenient, and primitive, was continued among the other Deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of <hi>Noah;</hi> and that <hi>Mizraim,</hi> the firſt Peopler of <hi>Egypt,</hi> introduced it thither; than that they ſhould leave the Choice of their Prieſts to the caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Votes of the People, or to the Nomination of the Heads of them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it probable, that theſe would eaſily give up ſuch a choice Prerogative, which raiſed them to the higheſt Rank and Power, next to their Monarchs; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled them to ſo great a Share in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them: Which Prerogative, <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us<note n="3" place="bottom">

Here is no Need of any Depth of Learning or Sagacity to decide the Point; a common Share of unbiaſſed Reaſon will eaſily enable a Man to judge in ſo plain a Caſe; and ſo did the <hi>Egyptians</hi> accordingly, when they cried out, <hi>We be all dead Men</hi>

               <p>But, 4<hi>thly,</hi> The Death of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Firſt-born was no leſs an Evidence of God's ſupreme Goodneſs and Juſtice, than of his Omnipotence, and abſolute Sovereignty: For ſince <hi>Egypt</hi> was now become ripe, upon ſo many accounts, for Puniſhment, and for ſuch an exemplary one as ſhould convince both its Inhabitants, and all other Nations that heard of it, of the over-ruling Power of the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and of the Impotence and Vanity of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Deities; what could be a more pregnant Proof of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Juſtice, than the ſparing the guiltleſs and miſguided Laity, and cauſing the Effects of his Anger to fall only on their miſcreant Guides; who, inſtead of preſerving, had, for the moſt baſe and ſelfiſh Ends, not barely corrupted, but in a great meaſure obliterated, the old patriarchal Religion; and ſubſtituted to it the impious, as well as monſtrous, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ſuch a vaſt Variety of falſe Deities; and with it the moſt unnatural and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rites and Superſtitions; which, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

There remained one thing more to be done to crown this wonderful Tranſaction; and that was, to have it recorded in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible Characters, that the lateſt Poſterity might have all the moral Certainty of its Truth and Reality, that the Nature of it could poſſibly admit of. And to this end it was that God ordained the grand Feſtival of the Paſſover, or Eating of the Paſchal Lamb, to be yearly celebrated; and commanded moreover all the firſt-born Males, both of Man and Beaſt, to be ſanctified to him; and to be ſeverally redeemed; the former with the Price of five Shekels, as ſoon as they were thirty Days old<note n="t" place="bottom">

               <p>However that be, it cannot but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that this laſt miraculous Cataſtrophe was a moſt convincing Proof, both to the ſurviving <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and to all the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about, of the Falſhood of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which had hitherto ſo fatally miſled them from the Knowlege and Worſhip of that one ſupreme and almighty Being, into a Belief and Confidence in their own reſpective imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Deities.

But even this Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>a priori,</hi> might be juſtly decreed againſt them by God, from a Preſcience that they would infallibly refuſe his more peaceful Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, out of an invincible Reluctance to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their Idolatries, and impious Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for his more pure and rational Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; upon which Conditions only they were to be admitted to the Benefit of them. So that this Exception, with reſpect to them, might mean no more than this: As for theſe ſeven Nations, who, notwithſtanding I have in Mercy ſpared hitherto, have now filled the Meaſure of their Iniquity, by the moſt horrid and abominable Superſtitions; you may ſpare all farther Offers of Pardon, and act againſt them, as if they had actually rejected them; becauſe I well know, that they are determined to do ſo, and are therefore unworthy of any farther Invitation or Encouragement. The Event did ſufficiently juſtify it; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy which they unanimouſly entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, not only againſt <hi>Joſhua,</hi> but againſt the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who, tho' included in the ſame

upon the Enemy with his uſual Bravery; and ſlacks not his Purſuit of them, till he hath utterly deſtroyed them. And what is ſtill more remarkable, God is ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving him for it, that he encourages him to go on, with the Promiſe of a complete, and even a miraculous, Victory<note n="p" place="bottom">

Thus far went the Divine Interdict againſt the ſeven Nations above-mentioned. But as to the reſt of the People to be conquered, they were to be treated in a different manner, and to have the Offers of Peace, on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions lately mentioned, ſent to every City; which if accepted, they became tributary; and, in all other reſpects, were left to enjoy their Freedom and Laws: But if rejected, a ſecond Offer was ſent to them, to depart quietly and unmoleſted, whitherſoever they would: But if this laſt was ſtill refuſed, then they were at Liberty to begin Hoſtilities againſt them; and, when ſubdued, to kill every Man, and ſeize on their Women, Children, and Cattle, as their Spoil<note n="s" place="bottom">

               <p>The next Proof which God gave the now diſheartened <hi>Canaanites,</hi> of his irreſiſtible Power, was the ſurpriſing manner in which they beſieged and took the firſt City in that Country, and the miraculous Downfal of its ſtout Walls, by the Circumvection of the ſacred Ark, in a formal Proceſſion: Which, how ſtrange ſoever it might appear to the Beſieged, during the firſt ſix Days, could not fail of convincing them of it on the ſeventh;

they would, like them, have ſtill perſiſted in their Defiance to his ſupreme Power, and been involved in the ſame Fate; whereas God here permits his People to be over-reached by, and to make a ſolemn Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with, them; in Vindication of which he diſplays his almighty Power in a more ſignal manner, than ever he had done upon any Occaſion, to preſerve them, as laſting Monuments of his Clemency, and Readineſs to receive all that fled to him for Protection, as to the true and only ſupreme Being.</p>
               <p>The ſame may, in a great meaſure, be ſaid of all the other <hi>Canaanites;</hi> whom, if he had abſolutely decreed to utter Exciſion, he would never have ſuffered to have been preſerved alive, and live intermixed with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as he did<note n="O" place="bottom">It is indeed more than probable, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged many others to accept of the ſame peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Terms; and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Council, to admit them to the ſame Benefit: For though theſe laſt were at firſt highly provoked at the fraudulent manner by which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them, yet when they found, ſoon after, how manifeſtly God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and what Wonders he wrought to ſave them from the Fury of the five <hi>Amorite</hi> Kings, they might perceive juſt Cauſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Words of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in a more moderate Senſe, and confine the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Exciſion only to thoſe who ſhould perſiſt in an obſtinate Defiance.

So that, in a little while, the very Remembrance of them would have been quite obliterated; and both they, and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> have ſhared in the ſame common Bleſſings, and have had Cauſe to rejoice under the bliſsful Sunſhine of the Divine Providence; from which none would then have been excluded, but the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and Irreclaimable.</p>

               <p>Whether this famous Perſon was a real Prophet, and Worſhiper of the true God, or an Heathen, and a mere Conjurer, or Soothſayer, is, you know, much diſputed by the Learned among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> both antient and modern.

no Reaſon why we may not admit him to have been a real Prophet, tho' otherwiſe a bad Man, and much given to Incantation, and other heatheniſh Superſtitions; and a Worſhiper of the true God, tho' not in all reſpects a true Worſhiper of him.

chiefly for the Good and Benefit of thoſe that acknowleged and relied on him: And, 2<hi>dly,</hi> That all the Deities they had adopted, and confided in, were either imaginary Deluſions, or elſe Creatures ſubordinate to, and wholly directed by, him.</p>
               <p>Here your Antagoniſt, having nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to object againſt ſo reaſonable a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſets himſelf wholly to find Fault with the ſtrange, and, as he is pleaſed to call it, unaccountable Method, by which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted: The Whole of whoſe Objections may be reduced to the following Heads; <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. His opening the Mouth of the dumb Aſs, to reprimand him for his pretended ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim'd Reſentment and Cruelty.</p>

               <p>Let us now examine each of theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by the Rules of Reaſon; and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon an impartial Examination, they will appear in that ridiculous Light in which he hath ſtated them; or not rather as uniform and well conducted Series of Events, all tending to the End propoſed; the reducing thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated Nations from their vain Confidence in their falſe Deities, to a due Senſe of, and a ſteady Reliance on, God's all-wiſe and over-ruling Providence, in a way the moſt adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0177700400:185"/>
to their Capacities, and, at the ſame time, the moſt effectual to convince rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, without the leaſt Infringement on their natural Liberty.</p>
               <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> then, With reſpect to the pretended Improbability of God's endowing a Perſon of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Character with the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, I cannot ſee whence it ariſes: And it being his declared Deſign to convince thoſe ſuperſtitious Nations, who placed no ſmall Confidence in their pretended Prophets, of his over-ruling Power; where is the Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or even Wonder, if, in compliance with their Notion, he ſhould raiſe a real one among them, that ſhould fully anſwer that End? But why ſhould he make Choice of one of his vile Character? Moſt probably, becauſe one of a better would not have anſwered the End propoſed; and his bleſſing <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of curſing them, might have been looked upon as the Effect of his Zeal for that favourite Nation of Providence, and of his Hatred to the idolatrous Notions and Rites of the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Midianites;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Perſon of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s unbounded Ambition and Avarice, and moreover addicted to the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0177700400:186"/>
reigning Sorceries and Inchantments of thoſe Times, being forced, againſt his own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Intereſt, to bleſs thoſe, whom <hi>Balak</hi> would have bribed him, at any Rate, to curſe, could not but convince them, as well as all the reſt of his Behaviour on this Occaſion did, that he was driven to it by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, or rather irreſiſtible Power; as, on the other hand, had he been leſs than a real Prophet, or had he been, as many learned Men have ſuppoſed him, only a mere Conjurer or Inchanter, all that he uttered in favour of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> People, might have been imputed either to his Want of Skill, or to a ſudden, inward Fear of bringing ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Reſentment from them upon his Head, or to any other Cauſe, rather than to ſuch a divine and irreſiſtible Impulſe.</p>
               <p>But here your Antagoniſt further objects againſt the Probability of God's condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to converſe, or, as he modeſtly words it, to dialogue it, with ſuch an infamous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, or, at beſt, a baſe Proſtituter of the prophetic Gift.

was to end in Diſgrace and Diſappointment, who could be more deſerving of it, than he who appeared ſo ready to proſtitute his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic Office to his own ambitious Views?</p>
               <p>But, 2<hi>dly,</hi> Why, ſays your Antagoniſt, ſhould God ſo ſtrictly forbid him to go with <hi>Balak</hi>'s firſt Meſſengers; and yet not only permit him, but oblige him, to go with the ſecond? I anſwer, for the greater Pomp and Grandeur of the Thing. Had he been
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0177700400:189"/>
ſuffered to go with the firſt, who, the Text intimates, were but few in Number, and Perſons of a lower Rank; their Report of the extraordinary Oppoſition which he was to meet with on the Way, having no other Witneſſes than they, and the Prophet's two Servants, might have been liable to Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion; and ſo failed of making a due Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on thoſe that had ſent them. But when <hi>Balak</hi> ſees himſelf obliged to ſend new ones of an higher Rank, as well as in greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (who may be ſuppoſed to have had a ſuitable Retinue after them, being ſtiled Princes by the ſacred <note n="m" place="bottom">

               <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> But here the next Objection ſtarted by your Antagoniſt is, Why was God angry with <hi>Balaam</hi> for going with the Meſſengers, ſeeing he had not only permitted, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, him to do ſo? The common Solution which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers give us, is, that <hi>Balaam</hi> flattered himſelf, that God had or might be prevailed upon to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Intentions with reſpect to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> either by his Sacrifices or Inchantments; by which means he would gain ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Preferment, as well as great Reputation, among the <hi>Moabites.</hi> But if this had been the only Cauſe of God's Anger, would he not more probably have ſuffered him to go on in his fond Conceit, and then puniſhed his Preſumption, in the Face of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Midian;</hi> either by forcing him to bleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of curſing, or by turning his Curſes into
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0177700400:191"/>
Bleſſings? Which would have equally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his End, without being at the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſending an Angel to obſtruct his Way. It muſt be owned that the Crime which the Angel here lays to his Charge, is but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely expreſſed, and, according to moſt Verſions and Commentators, implies no more than that he had warped or perverted his Way before God<note n="o" place="bottom">

But this Rencounter, as related and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated by the inſpired Hiſtorian, is, it ſeems, what your Antagoniſt thinks can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be treated with too great Contempt. A celebrated Prophet and Diviner, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Perſon well acquainted of courſe with ſuch Viſions, is oppoſed by an Angel, with a drawn Sword; yet goes reſolutely on, inſenſible of his Danger; whilſt the Beaſt he rides on, the moſt ſtupid Animal of the whole Creation, is clear-ſighted enough to perceive and avoid it, by turning out of the Way, and ſaves her Rider from running blindfold into it. This is repeated twice more, in two ſuch narrow Paths, that the Aſs is forced, in the one, to cruſh her Rider's Foot againſt the Wall; and, in the other, to crouch down upon her Belly, to avoid his ruſhing on his Deſtruction; for which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Care and Concern ſhe is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a ſevere Drubbing. Which, ſays your Friend, deſerves the greater Admiration or Laughter; the Perſpicuity and Prudence of the dumb Creature, or the Stupidity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of the Prophet? But what is even this, compared to the ſurpriſing Dialogue
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0177700400:194"/>
that enſues between the Maſter and his Beaſt, in which the latter hath ſo much the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the former, in point of Reaſoning and Temper; in that ſhe contents herſelf with calmly expoſtulating his unjuſt Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; whilſt he, on the contrary, breaks out into a furious Reſentment, and wiſhing at that Inſtant for a Sword to diſpatch her, for her extraordinary and repeated Services to him<note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> xxii. 22-29.</note>? The Angel likewiſe, in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, makes but a mean Figure amongſt them: His ill-timed Anger againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, whoſe Eyes he knew to be with-holden from ſeeing him; and his rebuking him for his ill Requital to his Aſs, whoſe new-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Gifts of Speech and Reaſoning, he thinks, made him ſufficient Amends for his ſevere Drubbing; are, he ſuppoſes very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to the Character of an heavenly Meſſenger<note n="q" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. Verſe</hi> 32.</note>; and his telling him, that he would have killed him upon the Spot, if the Aſs had not timely ſaved him, by turning aſide out of his Reach<note n="r" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. Verſe</hi> 33.</note>, is what he judges would have rather become the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0177700400:195"/>
of an infernal one. So that, upon the Whole, he highly commends <hi>Joſephus</hi> for ſuppreſſing that Part of the Dialogue, rather than expoſing his Credulity, by trying in vain to palliate it<note n="s" place="bottom">

               <p>I have now given your Antagoniſt's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections their full Strength, tho' not couched them in his ludicrous and ſarcaſtical Terms; to avoid, as much as poſſible, the diſtaſteful Contraſt that would appear between them, and the Seriouſneſs with which the Subject, whatever he may think to the contrary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be treated. In doing which I ſhall not, like ſome of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers, have recourſe to allegorical and other eluſory Subterfuges<note n="C" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Maimonides,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, pretend that this whole Scene was tranſacted only in a Viſion, in which they have been followed by ſome Chriſtians. Others think, that the whole Tranſaction muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in an allegorical Senſe; that the Aſs was ſtopped from going on by ſome extraordinary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe; that the Blows which its Rider gave it ſet it not a ſpeaking articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lately, but a braying; which he, however, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his conjuring Skill, or his Acquaintance with the Language of Brutes, rightly interpreted as a juſt Rebuke for ſtriking her. Others again think, that <hi>Moſes</hi> copied this whole Account out of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs which were found in <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Cuſtody, after he had been ſlain by the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been written by him: Upon which Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Moſes</hi> thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to tranſmit them in the very Terms they were couched in; not, indeed, to have them believed as true, but merely to expoſe the Vanity of the Diviners of his Time<note n="1" place="bottom">

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0177700400:196"/>
aught I know, have rather given Birth to thoſe ſatirical Reflections, with which your Friend, and many more of the ſame Stamp, have treated this and other ſcriptural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but confine myſelf to making ſuch Remarks as naturally reſult from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Relation of this ſingular Event, and ſhew how every Step and Circumſtance tended to the main Deſign, which was to convince both <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Midian,</hi> in the moſt ſenſible and rational Manner, of the Injuſtice and Inefficacy of all their Efforts againſt a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0177700400:197"/>
from whom they had nothing to fear; and conſequently, no Grounds for any ſuch hoſtile Stratagems, as they were hatching againſt them; and who, being under the Guidance and Protection of an infinitely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Power to all their pretended Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were out of the Reach of all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Darts, unleſs it were to return them with double Force on their own Heads.</p>
               <p>Let us then ſuppoſe, that this celebrated Diviner, by whoſe Inchantments the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and their Confederates, expected to prove more fatal to the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Hoſt, than all their united Force and Valour could be, is now in full March, at the Head of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Train of Noblemen, and in full Scent of Honour and Preſerment; when, on the ſudden, and contrary to its uſual Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, his Beaſt makes a full Stop, without any viſible Hindrance, and will not be ſet forward again, but by dint of dry Blows: They come next to a narrow Path, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file; where, after a freſh Stop, and a ſecond Drubbing, they ſee the fearful Beaſt ſqueeze itſelf quite cloſe to the Wall, to avoid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in its Way, which neither he nor his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0177700400:198"/>
Company can perceive; and in doing which, it is forced to cruſh its Rider's Foot againſt the Wall. This could not but be ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing to them; but ſtill more ſo, when, after ſome Miles riding, they come into a ſtreight Path, where they ſee the frighted Beaſt, inſtead of going forward, crouch ſuddenly on its Belly; becauſe it ſaw no Way to ſlide by the unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Oppoſer, and continue a while motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, under a third, and more ſevere, Volley of Blows. All this could not fail of drawing the Attention, as well as Wonder, of the whole Caravan: But whilſt they are ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Strangeneſs of the Adventure, a new Scene offers itſelf; in which tho' the Prophet had the largeſt Share of the Surprize, yet it could not but fill the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with freſh Aſtoniſhment. For here, on the ſudden, the dumb Beaſt's Mouth is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly opened; not in its uſual braying Tone, but in ſuch a manner, that the Rider feels himſelf ſeverely reproved for his ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timed Severity; but whether in ſuch articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Words as were underſtood by the reſt, or only by the Prophet, I ſhall not preſume to determine; tho' there is no Doubt but they underſtood the paſſionate Reply which he made
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0177700400:199"/>
to it. They muſt be no leſs ſurpriſed at his paſſionate Expreſſions on that Occaſion, when they heard him wiſh for a Sword to ſlay the guiltleſs Animal; without being able ſo much as to gueſs at the Cauſe of all this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Behaviour, both of the Aſs and its Rider. Whilſt they ſtand in this Suſpenſe, they ſee the latter fall proſtrate on his Face before the Angel, and making his Apology to him for what he had ignorantly done, and offering to return to his own Home, ſince God ſeemed now ſo diſpleaſed with his Journey to the Land of <hi>Moab</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Num. ub. ſup. Ver.</hi> 21-34.</note>. I will not pretend to decide, whether the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of <hi>Balak,</hi> who were preſent at this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Scene, did ſee the Angel, or heard what he ſaid to the Prophet, becauſe the Text hints nothing of it; but as they could not but hear what he ſaid to the heavenly Meſſenger, and admire his humble Behaviour to him, they muſt of courſe ſuppoſe, that there muſt be ſomething more than natural, that had thus ſtayed the Aſs in its Way, and now at laſt extorted ſuch Language and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment from its Rider; for hitherto he had
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0177700400:200"/>
betrayed ſuch uncommon Eagerneſs to go with them, and ſatisfy their Deſires, in hopes of the large Rewards promiſed to him, that he could not forbear expreſſing an indecent Reſentment againſt the Beaſt, for ſeeming to oppoſe or retard his Speed; whereas, after the ſeeing of this unexpected Viſion, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears altogether diſcouraged, and ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and give up all further Hopes of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And as this Rencounter made him ſo ſtrangely alter his Behaviour, and caſt ſuch a Damp upon his ſanguine Views; ſo I doubt not, but in the Account he gave them of it, as they went on, it produced a different Kind of Diſcourſe with them, and ſuch as would prove a proper Preface to the Diſappointment they were like to meet with. For it is plain, from the ſtrict Charge which the Angel gave him, <hi>of ſpeaking only what God ſhould dictate to him</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Num. ub. ſup. Verſe</hi> 35.</note>, that he had no great Hopes, that the Event would prove according to his and their Wiſhes. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, upon his firſt Approach to the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> King, he prepares him in the ſame Way, by telling him, that, now he was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0177700400:201"/>
come, he had no Power at all to ſpeak any thing, but what the Lord ſhould pleaſe to put in his Mouth<note n="w" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Num. ub. ſup. Verſe</hi> 38.</note>. And it is hardly to be doubted, but his Meſſengers took alſo Care to inform him of all that had paſſed in their Journey homewards; particularly, the Rencounter with the Angel, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of the Aſs: From both which they might find Occaſion to infer a Likelihoood, that their Deſigns againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> were going to be defeated by a ſuperior Power; and might be more upon their Guard to examine every Circumſtance, to prevent their being impoſed upon by the Perſon who was pitched upon to be the chief Actor in it. For hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I ſee no Reaſon to ſuſpect him of any Cheat; becauſe, tho' he might be eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have contrived that ſurpriſing Scene, and pretended an extraordinary Viſion, in order to cover his Want of Power or Skill, or to avoid <hi>Balak</hi>'s Reſentment; yet how could he ever manage his dull Beaſt ſo art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as make it contribute its Part in, and to act it with the ſame Exactneſs as he did his own, without being perceived by ſome
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0177700400:202"/>
of the By-ſtanders? How could he make it ſtand ſtock ſtill in one Place, ſqueeze itſelf againſt a Wall in another, to avoid ſomething which neither he nor they could ſee; and in the third to crouch at once on its Belly; and in all three of them to continue motionleſs, under ſuch a Volley of dry Blows, and eſcape the Notice of ſome or other of his numerous Retinue? But I ſhall ſufficiently ſhew, by-and-by, how inconſiſtent his Deportment in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> the ſingular manner of his bleſſing the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Tribes, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Extent of the Prophecy he uttered on that Occaſion, is to ſuch a Suppoſition. But before I am come to that, it will be neceſſary to remove the two great Difficulties which your Antagoniſt raiſes againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the Adventure; <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Aſs's aſſuming, as he terms it, an human Voice and Speech, and a reaſonable Faculty, which, even according to the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, appears much ſuperior to that of its Maſter, tho' a Prophet and Diviner: And, 2<hi>dly,</hi> The ſtrange Rebuke which the Angel gives to the latter, for his ill-timed Cruelty to the former, allowing the Caſe to have

               <p>As to the firſt, the Impoſſibility of an Aſs's <hi>aſſuming</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid rather, being miraculouſly endowed with) an human Voice, and rational Faculty, it will be time enough to anſwer it, when he hath proved that pretended Impoſſibility of all Miracles, of which this is allowed to be one; and that no more againſt Nature, or above the Power of an almighty Agent, than any of thoſe that were wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or at the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> and for which I ſhall refer him to what hath been ſaid upon that Subject in the laſt Eſſay<note n="x" place="bottom">

                  </note>. For if it be once allowed that God hath ſtill reſerved to himſelf the Power, for ſome wiſe and important Ends, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with his own Laws (and his bare De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it, againſt all Reaſon, and the Senſe of all Nations, is no Proof, that he hath not or cannot do ſo), how will he make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that it is more above the Power of an

almighty Being, to enable a dumb Animal to pronounce ſome few articulate Words, in a rational Order, than to cleave the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> to rain down Manna ſix Days, and with-hold it on the ſeventh, or to cure the deadly Sting of fiery Serpents by the bare looking on an artificial brazen one? And if it be farther objected, that the dumb Beaſt ſhewed a greater Degree of Wiſdom than the Prophet that rode it, where even then will be the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if we conſider who inſpired it? And if ſome of the Brute Creation do, in many Caſes, diſplay a greater Sagacity in their Actions than thoſe of the human Species, who value themſelves ſo much on their ſuperior Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; need we be ſurpriſed here, that the moſt ſtupid of all Animals, being, on ſuch a particular Occaſion as this, endowed with a much higher Degree of Rationability, which is the utmoſt Extent that can be allowed to the Miracle, ſhould argue more juſtly than its Maſter, whoſe Judgment was hurried away by the Torrent of his boundleſs Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and the Proſpect of ſome conſiderable Advancement? If any thing ſeems to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our Admiration on this Occaſion, it muſt be, one would think, the Method which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0177700400:205"/>
the Divine Providence made choice of to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Stupidity of the Prophet<note n="z" place="bottom">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 16.</note>; and to deter both him, and thoſe who ſent for him, from purſuing their malevolent Views againſt the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and his chooſing rather by that means to forewarn them of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they would bring upon them, than to puniſh them for perſiſting in them. He might as eaſily have ordered the Angel to puniſh <hi>Balaam</hi> with immediate Death, as barely to obſtruct his Career; but if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the ſparing him, in order to make him a more effectual Inſtrument to convince both <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Midian,</hi> how vain and dangerous all their Efforts would prove, againſt a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom he had taken under his ſpecial Conduct and Favour, why ſhould the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the Miracle be deemed a ſufficient Proof againſt the Reality of it, when it is, in all other reſpects, ſo agreeable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs?</p>
               <p>I would farther obſerve here, that the opening the Mouth of the dumb Aſs could not but be a convincing Proof, both to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0177700400:206"/>
and his Company, how vain and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it would be for him to attempt, or them to bribe him, to ſpeak otherwiſe than God ſhould direct him; ſince the ſame Power that could enable a dumb Beaſt to ſpeak, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its Nature, was no leſs able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict the Tongue of its Rider from utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing but what ſhould be dictated to him. God might, indeed, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miracle, have put it wholly out of his Power to have done otherwiſe; but if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of depriving him of his Liberty upon this extraordinary Occaſion, he is rather pleaſed to deter him from abuſing it, and his <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Retinue from tempting him to it, by the miraculous Speaking of a dumb Aſs; was not this a moſt rational Way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing both, of his divine Interpoſition in favour of the <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> And here, by-the-by, did your Antagoniſt never read of an Aſs ſpeaking to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> a Lamb to <hi>Phrixius,</hi> an Horſe to <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> a Bull to <hi>Europa,</hi> and an Elephant to <hi>Porus.</hi>

If your Antagoniſt ſhould inſiſt, that the above Inſtances, out of Heathen Authors, ought to be underſtood in a figurative or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical Senſe, I would aſk of him, why may not the ſame be as well ſaid of this I am upon? Sure I am, that it carries with it a much more excellent and inſtructive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, than any that he can draw out of his profane Mythologiſts; whilſt it repreſents to us, in the moſt glaring Light, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects of Ambition and Avarice, in the Perſon of one of the moſt celebrated Diviners of the Eaſt; who, in ſpite of his great Skill, Learning, and other ſingular Qualifications, ſuffers himſelf to be hurried, as it were blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, by his predominant Paſſion, into the greateſt Danger; ſo that neither God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Prohibition and Threats, nor his other miraculous Warnings, can prevent his falling a fatal Sacrifice to it. I may ſafely add, that ſuch an allegorical Application is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with the main Scope of whole Tranſaction, that the moſt remarkable ones of this Nature, recorded in Holy Writ, plainly appear to have been conducted by the Divine Providence, with this further View,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0177700400:209"/>
either of prophetic Warning to the Perſons concerned, or of Inſtruction to thoſe that ſhould read or hear of them afterwards. Thus I obſerved, in the former Eſſay, how <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod, ſwallowing up thoſe of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Inchanters, was deſigned, moſt probably, to ſhew the ill Succeſs that would attend the latter, in their ill-timed Oppoſition of the former; and that the turning the Waters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Blood did no leſs pre-ſignify the dreadful Cataſtrophe that was to cloſe up the whole Conteſt<note n="d" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See before, p.</hi> 97, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> 110, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>. And why may we not ſuppoſe this whole Tranſaction to have been thus conducted with the ſame gracious View, not only towards the infatuated Prophet, whoſe Thirſt after Honour and Preferment made him overlook the moſt imminent Danger to which that had expoſed him; and, at the ſame time, to deter both <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Midian</hi> from purſuing their vain and injurious Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts againſt the <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> Your Antagoniſt ought to have known, that ſuch allegorical Way of Writing and Interpreting was one of the moſt eſteemed Branches of Learning in thoſe Days; and no Man was better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0177700400:210"/>
than <hi>Balaam</hi> to have made a true Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of every particular Event, had his Ambition permitted him to reflect ſeriouſly upon it. However, the Iſſue ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained their Intention: <hi>Balak,</hi> having tried in vain to avert God's ſpecial Bleſſing from the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by all the Ways which his Superſtition could ſuggeſt to him, or <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Skill contrive, diſmiſſes him with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Speech; <hi>I thought indeed to promote thee to great Honour; but the Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>hath kept thee back from Honour</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> xxiv. 11.</note>. After which we do not find, that he tried any further Inchantments, or other means, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> if we except his joining with the <hi>Midianites</hi> in the Project of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching them by the Charms of their beautiful Females; of which moſt pernicious Attempt I ſhall ſpeak in the Sequel; but, from that time, left them to enjoy the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bleſſing and Guidance unmoleſted; by which he ſaved himſelf, and his People, from that dreadful and univerſal Deſtruction, which the <hi>Midianites</hi> brought upon themſelves, by too greedily purſuing <hi>Balaam</hi>'s deſtructive
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0177700400:211"/>
Counſel; and in which they quickly became the dreadful Victims; he, of his Ambition and Avarice; and they, of their unjuſt Hatred and Impiety<note n="f" place="bottom">

               <p>By this time, I hope, another of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt's Difficulties is pretty well cleared; whether the perverſe View of the ambitious Prophet was a thing of Moment enough to deſerve the Commiſſioning of an Angel to oppoſe him? God might indeed have ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him ſhort, by an immediate and irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Impulſe; but how could the By-ſtanders have known whether it was a divine one, or only occaſioned by ſome conſcious Fear, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his own Inability, or of expoſing himſelf to ſome dreadful Reſentment, either from the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Monarch, or from the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Hoſt? Beſides, ſuch an abſolute Reſtraint upon the Will would have been inconſiſtent with the Method of God's deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with rational Creatures; nor could it have turn'd to his Glory, like that of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing them by Arguments ſuitable to their rational Faculties, and Freedom of Will:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0177700400:212"/>
For, by this means, he no leſs diſplays his Mercy and Goodneſs, than he doth his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in puniſhing them for their Abuſe of it; as here in the Caſe of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the <hi>Midianites.</hi> And can it be ſaid, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of the divine Will, either to a whole Nation, or even to one ſingle Perſon, for their Sakes, in order to convince them, that their Devices, and hoſtile Stratagems, were quite oppoſite to it, and would not only prove vain and fruitleſs, but dangerous and hurtful, was beneath the Office or Dignity of an Angel?</p>
               <p>But your Antagoniſt ſeems moſtly diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Behaviour and Reproof of the Angel to the Prophet; and thinks, that his declaring, that he would ſurely have killed him, if his Aſs had not prevented it, by luckily avoiding to come within his Reach, is more becoming the Language of an infernal, than that of an heavenly, Meſſenger. But here again he quite miſtakes the Caſe. The Words of the Angel, how ſevere ſoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only deſigned to deter the ambitious Prophet from purſuing a Deſign, which, how intereſting ſoever it might appear to him,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0177700400:213"/>
would ſurely turn to his Deſtruction, and of thoſe who engaged him in it, cannot be juſtly ſaid to ſavour of the Malignancy of an infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit; but rather, by far, to be exactly agreeable to the benevolent Nature of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly one; and, if candidly interpreted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Idiom, and duly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Conteſt, muſt be readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged to amount to no more than this; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"How couldſt thou thus unjuſtly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly abuſe thy innocent Beaſt, and not rather conclude, from her unuſual ſtarting aſide, and crouching under thee, that ſomething extraordinary muſt have ſtood in her Way, and obliged her to do ſo? For, behold, I was indeed ſent on Purpoſe to oppoſe thee; becauſe thy Views were perverſe before God, and oppoſite to his Deſign, in permitting thee to go with all this People. This Sight of me hath made thy Aſs decline me theſe three times; and well it is for thee, that ſome divine Impulſe enabled her both to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and avoid me, which was a ſure Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to me, that I ſhould ſpare and let thee go on; and that the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence deſigned to croſs thy malicious Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

The ſeverer therefore the Threatening was, the more kindly muſt we judge it to have been meant; as it was indeed the moſt effectual Way to deter the infatuated <hi>Balaam</hi> from ruſhing farther into his utter Ruin<note n="g" place="bottom">

I come next to the Apology which the Prophet makes to the Angel, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Verſion, runs thus<note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> xxii. 34.</note>: <hi>I have finned; for I knew not that thou ſtoodeſt in my Way.</hi> But that this cannot be the true Meaning of his Words, is manifeſt; for how could he be guilty in this reſpect, if his Eyes were with-held from ſeeing him? But, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Idiom, they carry a much higher Senſe, and more agreeable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text; <hi>viz. I have ſinned, or tranſgreſſed, in that I did not know, or duly conſider, that thou ſtoodeſt in my Way;</hi> or, in other Words, <hi>that thou didſt oppoſe my Proceeding</hi>

                     <p>Much ſuch another Apology did St. <hi>Paul</hi> make before the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> when accuſed of reviling God's High-Prieſt, for unjuſtly cauſing him to be ſmitten in the Mouth: <hi>I wiſt not, Brethren,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that he was the High-Prieſt</hi>

it be reaſonably ſaid that thoſe Miracles, which were wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> were wrought in vain, becauſe they met with ſo little Regard from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Court? But I ſhall not repeat here what hath been ſaid in a former Eſſay upon that Subject<note n="l" place="bottom">

               <p>It muſt be owned, that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Account of this extraordinary Tranſaction is very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, and leaves us to ſeek for ſundry par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtances; which, though he thought of leſs Moment to the main Deſign of his Narrative, yet would, in all Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, have obviated many of the Difficulties ſtarted by your Antagoniſt, if they had been mentioned by him.

Now it plainly appears, from the Tenor of his Relation, that the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> King, as well as his new Allies, placed ſuch Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Efficacy of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Bleſſings and Curſes (which was no extraordinary thing, conſidering the reigning Superſtition of thoſe Times), that he would have ſpared neither Rewards, nor ſumptuous Promiſes, to have obtained a plentiful Shower of the latter upon the ſo much dreaded <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Hoſt<note n="m" place="bottom">

It is true, God might eaſily have turned their hoſtile Deſigns, with a tenfold Uſury, upon their own Heads; but yet he rather chooſes to ſpare them; doubtleſs out of the ſame Regard to their Anceſtor <hi>Lot,</hi> that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to forbid the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to commit any Hoſtilities againſt them<note n="n*" place="bottom">

               <p>Whether <hi>Balaam</hi> did certainly conclude, from the Angel's ambiguous Commands, not to ſpeak any thing but what was put into his Mouth<note n="o" place="bottom">

On the other hand, the Dread of <hi>Balak</hi>'s, and the <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Princes Reſentment, who had him now in their Power, and might ſuſpect his Non-compliance to proceed from ſome ſecret Confederacy with their Enemies, rather than a Divine Interpoſition, added to the Mortification of ſeeing himſelf at once deprived of all his flattering Proſpects, could not but give him the greateſt Uneaſineſs: So that, to extricate himſelf, if poſſible, from ſo dangerous a Dilemma, he ſees himſelf obliged to have recourſe to ſome of thoſe Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, according to the ſuperſtitious Theology of thoſe Times, were imagined to be the moſt capable of engaging the Sun, Moon, Stars, and all other inferior Dignities, to eſpouſe the Quarrel of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Midian</hi> againſt the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> And here again the

Divine Providence, purſuing ſtill the ſame mild and gracious Tract, is pleaſed to permit him to try the utmoſt of his Skill, in order the more effectually to convince him, and his infatuated Clients, of the Vanity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficacy of his Art; and oblige them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege with him, that <hi>ſurely there was no Inchantment againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>nor Divination that could prevail againſt</hi> Iſreal<note n="o" place="bottom">

               <p>But here it may appear ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, that <hi>Balaam</hi> ſhould ſo ſoon forget his former Reſolution, or obliterate the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which his late Encounter with the Angel had made upon him; and much more ſo, how he could be ſo ſoon prevailed upon to act contrary to that noble Declaration he had ſo lately made to <hi>Balak,</hi> That if he would give him his Houſe full of Silver and Gold, he could not be allowed to utter one Word beyond what the Lord <hi>(Jehovah)</hi> was pleaſed to dictate to him. But the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will ſoon vaniſh, if we conſider, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That <hi>Balak</hi> might take that as an artful Grimace, chiefly calculated to extort a more
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0177700400:224"/>
ample Reward from him; and, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, be the more profuſe in his Promiſes to him; as he could not but plainly ſee, that Avarice and Ambition were his predominant Paſſions. 2<hi>dly, Balaam</hi> had, by this time, beheld ſo much of the Splendor of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abitiſh</hi> Court, and received ſuch extraordinary Honours and Careſſes, both from that, and from the <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Princes, as might eaſily outbalance all other Conſiderations with him; and if he ſtill retained, as he could hardly do otherwiſe, any Fear of the Divine Diſpleaſure, it was now outweighed by a greater and more affecting one, to a Man of his Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>viz.</hi> that of forfeiting all thoſe Honours, and flattering Promiſes, and being diſmiſſed with Shame and Diſgrace. However, 3<hi>dly,</hi> He had ſtill a Salvo againſt his Fear of the Divine Diſpleaſure, namely, that he did not intend, by thoſe Inchantments, to thwart the Purpoſes of the Supreme Being; but only to try to render them more favourable to his Wiſhes, by taking to his Aſſiſtance all thoſe inferior Deities, and ſtriving to obtain that by their Mediation, and benign Influence, which he could not procure to his generous

Clients by any other Intereſt<note n="E" place="bottom">There could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all this, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent either with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Theology of thoſe Nations, or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the Character of <hi>Balaam,</hi> both as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and Worſhiper of the true God, as I have ſhewn at the Entrance on this Eſſay. And in caſe his Endeavours to obtain the ſo much deſired Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour did not meet with Succeſs, he could but, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his former Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, comply with God's Injunction of bleſſing <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> in what manner, and to what Degree, he ſhould pleaſe to order it; in which caſe he would be then ſo far acquitted by <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Midian,</hi> that he had done all in his Power to anſwer their Requeſts, and that his Diſappointment was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly owing to a divine and irreſiſtible Interpoſition; to the Truth of which, the Rencounter with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and the Miracle of the dumb Aſs's ſpeaking, as ſeen and vouched by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak</hi>'s Meſſengers, would give a ſtill greater Sanction.</note>. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, the firſt Eſſay he made was the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeven Altars to be built, and a Bullock and a Ram to be offered upon each of them<note n="p" place="bottom">

more than one at a time, either under the Patriarchal, or <hi>Moſaic,</hi> Diſpenſation; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed was a greater Number compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the Notion of one Supreme Being, which <hi>Balaam</hi> profeſſed to worſhip. But if he reared them to the ſeven Planets, which were eſteemed the greateſt and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all the ſubordinate Deities, as we have great Reaſon to ſuppoſe he did, becauſe that kind of Theology had been ſome time in vogue in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſpread itſelf all over thoſe Parts<note n="r" place="bottom">

What makes this Interpretation appear to me the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is, that upon his firſt Rencounter with God, at the Concluſion of the firſt of thoſe grand Ceremonies, he addreſſes him in theſe Terms; <hi>I have prepared ſeven Altars, and offered upon each of them a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, and a Ram</hi>

offered, to him: So that he means no more, according to the Theology then reigning, than this; <hi>I have invoked, by the uſual Rites, the ſeven Planets, or inferior Deities, to whom thou haſt committed the Government of the World, to interpoſe their Mediation with thee, on the behalf of</hi> Moab <hi>and</hi> Midian. What confirms this Senſe ſtill more is, that after he has declared the Tenor of the Divine Anſwer, in Terms the moſt oppoſite to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak</hi>'s Wiſhes, that Monarch doth not deſire him to apply himſelf to ſome other inferior Deities; there being little Reaſon to hope, that theſe ſhould prove more ſucceſsful than the former; but only deſires him to repeat the ſame Sacrifices to them, from ſome other<note n="t" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> xxiii. 13.</note> Eminence, which might prove more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than this. To which I may add, that the laſt two Trials are performed at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and in Compliance with, the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious King; and not by the Prophet's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or Choice; who could not but certainly conclude, from the expreſs Tenor of the firſt Divine Anſwer, the Impoſſibility of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Reverſion of it. However, as this
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0177700400:228"/>
Worſhip and Invocation of the Planets was one of the main Branches of heatheniſh Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, which God had ſo ſolemnly declared his Diſpleaſure againſt, and done ſo many Wonders, both in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other Places, to extirpate out of the Minds of thoſe infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated Nations; we may reaſonably rank it among the unlawful means which <hi>Balaam</hi> made uſe of upon this Occaſion, and which <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions under the Name of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Inchantments. Others he might, and probably did uſe, which that Lawgiver hath given us no farther Account of, than where he tells us, that when he <hi>(Balaam)</hi> found, at the third Trial, that God was determined to bleſs <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he went not, as at other times, to ſeek for them, but ſet his Face towards the Wilderneſs; that is, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Hoſt; and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Divine Impulſe, delivered his third Bleſſing on them, in more emphatical and magnificent Terms, than he had done at the two former; till <hi>Balak,</hi> quite out of all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience at his expreſſing himſelf in ſo high and extraordinary a manner in favour of them, and at his ſtill uſing ſome freſh and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Expreſſions, of God's peculiar and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable

               <p>However, the Divine Providence took ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Care to convince, not only them, but future Ages, of his prophetic Commiſſion, before he left the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Court: For he no ſooner had, in ſome meaſure, appeaſed the King's Anger, than he felt himſelf ſeized

with a freſh prophetic Impulſe; and, having gained the Attention of the whole Aſſembly, began to extend his Predictions on ſundry King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and People, and to diſplay their various Fates, both by Sea and Land, in ſo plain a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that whatever ſlight Impreſſion they might make on thoſe that then heard him, yet, by their timely Accompliſhment afterwards, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhew'd, that they all flowed from the ſame divine Original<note n="y" place="bottom">

To all which I ſhall only add a Remark or two more, upon the Whole; namely, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> On the great Condeſcenſion of the Almighty towards thoſe infatuated Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whoſe Minds being ſadly byaſſed by Prejudice and Cuſtom, as well as by the Craftineſs and Artifices of their ſelfiſh Prieſts, who took ſpecial Care to calculate their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Superſtitions, as beſt ſuited with the depraved Taſte of their Votaries, were, in a great meaſure, incapable of being reduced by Arguments drawn from Reaſon; and could only be wrought upon by ſuch ſtrong Impulſes of Senſe, and intereſting Motives, as theſe I have been animadverting upon, and which were indeed the fitteſt to be ſet in Oppoſition to, and to preponderate, thoſe art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and illuſory ones, by which their Minds had been till then captivated by thoſe jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling Guides. The next is, His extreme Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards them, in delaying to make them Examples of his Juſtice, for the Determent of others, till their incorrigible Obſtinacy plainly proved them to be unworthy of any
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0177700400:238"/>
farther Tokens of his Forbearance. This I have ſhewn, in my firſt Eſſay, to have been the Caſe of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> notwithſtanding all the Wonders which he wrought among them<note n="g" place="bottom">

                  </note>; and will no leſs plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, upon an impartial Review, to be the Caſe of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Midian</hi> here. An ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Jealouſy conceived againſt a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who, by all that God had already done for them, appeared to have been deſigned by his Providence to become the happy Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> inſtead of the old Inhabitants, who had polluted it with the moſt abominable Idolatries, and the vileſt and moſt inhuman Rites, engages thoſe two infatuated Nations to enter into an unjuſt and hoſtile Confederacy againſt them; to render which the more effectual, <hi>Balaam,</hi> a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Prophet and Inchanter, is ſent for, to ſupply, by his Curſes, what was wanting in them, either of Courage or Strength, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them. He refuſes their firſt Preſents and Promiſes, telling the Meſſenger, that the Supreme Being had taken them into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and would not permit him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0177700400:239"/>
any thing to their Hurt. <hi>Balak</hi> ſends a ſecond Embaſſy, conſiſting of a greater Number of his Nobles; and <hi>Balaam</hi> is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Reſtrictions, permitted to go with them, that they might be ſo many credible Witneſſes of the extraordinary Rencounter he was to meet with in his Way, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Check to his perverſe and ambitious Views, and a proper Preparative to his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abitiſh</hi> Retinue, for the Diſappointment that was to enſue. His Beaſt is thrice ſtopped in the Way, in a ſtrange and unuſual manner, at the Sight of an Angel, and forced to crouch at laſt under the Weight of its Rider's Blows before their Eyes; and being, on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, endowed with an human Voice, reproves him for his unjuſt Treatment of her; upon which his Eyes, till then with-held from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heavenly Meſſenger, behold him with his Sword drawn: He hears himſelf ſeverely reproved for ſtill entertaining ſuch perverſe and oppoſite Views to the Deſigns of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and particularly for his Cruelty to his own Beaſt, to whoſe Deflexion he owed the Preſervation of his Life, ſeeing he ſtood there ready to ſlay him, had not the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence directed the innocent Beaſt to avoid
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0177700400:240"/>

                  </note>. In all which there was nothing, as I have elſewhere obſerved, but what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the common Belief of thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Nations; and the artful Practices of their Diviners and Prieſts, which, whether real or pretended, that is, whether wrought by the Help of Demons, or the Effect of Juggling, or mere Deluſion (a Point not yet ſufficiently cleared), ſeldom failed of making a deep Impreſſion on the Beholders. Nothing therefore could well be more aptly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendingly calculated, than this real and twofold Miracle, to convince the ſuperſtitious <hi>Moabites,</hi> in their own Way, that if <hi>Balaam</hi> did, in the Sequel, thwart, inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with, their Monarch's Requeſt, it was owing to the Divine Interpoſition, which it was out of his Power to reſiſt; and, at the ſame time, nothing could be a properer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment to the Prophet, from cheriſhing his ambitious Views, than this miraculous Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and the Angel's ſevere Reproof and Interdiction. Again, when <hi>Balak</hi>'s pompous Promiſes to him had ſo far obliterated thoſe
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0177700400:241"/>
Impreſſions, as to ſet him upon the trying the Power of his Inchantments, in order to oblige that Monarch, he is foiled again and again in his Attempts; and forced, in ſpite of his Heart, to pronounce the nobleſt and moſt endearing Bleſſings on thoſe, on whom he was hired, and earneſtly wiſhed, to have poured the bittereſt Curſes; whilſt <hi>Balak</hi> hath the ſingular Mortification to find every freſh Trial he makes of his Art, to come out more irkſome and diſcouraging; till his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and Deſpair provoke him to diſmiſs him out of his Preſence and Territory. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Balaam,</hi> irritated at his Diſgrace and Diſappointment, forgets all the former Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and, in a Fit of Reſentment, deviſes that impious Stratagem, which he hopes will draw down that Curſe upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which his Inchantments could not effect; and, by his dreadful End, and the univerſal Slaughter of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> his infatuated Accomplices, God gives a freſh and irrefragable Proof to <hi>Moab,</hi> and all the Kingdoms round about, of his unerring Providence, his Power, Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and Goodneſs, in defeating and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the impious Attempts of the Enemies of his choſen People, and ſparing the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi>

But even in theſe Inſtances of his Rigour on thoſe implacable Enemies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is plain that he did not let them feel the Effects of it, till they had reſiſted all thoſe rational means which he had been uſing, in order to reclaim them; whilſt, on the other hand, he appears to have been no leſs ſevere towards the offending <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the ſudden and exemplary Death of thoſe 24,000 Miſcreants, who had been drawn away to the Worſhip of <hi>Baal-peor,</hi> than gracious and merciful to the reſt, by putting ſuch an effectual and ſpeedy Stop, by that means, to the further ſpreading of that Defection and Apoſtaſy<note n="i" place="bottom">

How could they imagine it poſſible for their Forces, how nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and valiant ſoever, to ſtop the <hi>Hebrew</hi> General's Career, whom they knew to have ſtop that of the two Luminaries, their two grand Deities, in the midſt of theirs; and to have engaged the very Elements to over-whelm ſo many Myriads of the flying Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates with Hailſtones; whilſt that Day was miraculouſly lengthened, to give him Time to cut off their diſcomfited Remains<note n="a" place="bottom">

                  </note>? What Help could they hope for from their Deities, who had thus far already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the utter Exciſion of their South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Votaries, and ſuffered the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to deſtroy all their Temples, Altars, and Images<note n="b" place="bottom">

their whole Country to the irreſiſtible Force of ſuch an Enemy, rather than ruſh into unavoidable Deſtruction, by attempting to oppoſe him?</p>
               <p>This Difficulty, how great ſoever it may appear, will quickly vaniſh, if we conſider, that theſe were, like the reſt, given up by God to a judicial Infatuation, and to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Refuſal of all Offers of Peace, on the Conditions required of them<note n="c" place="bottom">

                  </note>. Nor is it indeed to be much wondered at, that they ſhould be ſo unanimous in their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of dying Sword in Hand, in Defence of their Liberty, Religion, and Country; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Spirit reigned almoſt every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where among thoſe Nations; and thoſe among them were held in the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Abhorrence, that preferred not Death, in ſo intereſting a Cauſe, to an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Servitude, on ſuch diſhonourable Terms, as they eſteemed the Exchange of their old idolatrous Worſhip for that of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom they looked upon, by this time, as an incenſed and inexorable
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0177700400:248"/>
Judge, rather than as an Object worthy their Adoration and Love. In this deſperate Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what could be expected from them, but that their Reſolutions ſhould prove equally deſperate; and that they ſhould try, by one bold Stroke of their united Force, either to ſave their All, or periſh in the Attempt?</p>

               <p>But here your Opponent raiſes a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Difficulty againſt the Poſſibility of <hi>Joſhua's</hi> (whom he ſuppoſes to have been ſtill at his Camp at <hi>Gilgal)</hi> reaching them, in ſo ſhort a time, to the Place of their Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0177700400:251"/>
at the Waters of <hi>Merom;</hi> which he likewiſe ſuppoſes to be the <hi>Samachonitiſh</hi> Lake, ſituate about half-way between that of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezareth,</hi> and the Spring-head of the River <hi>Jordan.</hi> For, according to that twofold Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he and his Army muſt have marched at leaſt an hundred Miles, and a great Part of the Way over high Mountains, and narrow Defiles, in that ſhort time; which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently impoſſible. Your Friends may indeed wonder, that the ſacred Hiſtorian ſhould have given us ſo confuſed and imperfect an Account of that ſignal Victory; eſpecially if <hi>Joſhua</hi> himſelf was, as he is ſuppoſed by moſt Interpreters, the Penman of it; for, as he was ſo conſummate a General, it might be reaſonably expected, that he would have, if not embelliſhed his Relation, yet at leaſt been more particular in deſcribing the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances both of his March, and of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the Enemy. But they ought to have remembred, that it is the peculiar Character, I might have called it Excellency, of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtorians, to relate Facts with a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing unaffected Simplicity; and, in all Actions of this Nature, to avoid, as much as poſſible, entering into ſuch Particulars, as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0177700400:252"/>
relate to their own Prudence, Conduct, or Valour; leſt they ſhould appear to aſſume any Share of that Glory to themſelves, which was intirely due to their Heavenly Protector. Hence it is, that the inſpired Writer here thought fit to confine himſelf to the two moſt material Points; <hi>viz.</hi> The Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a complete Victory over that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and ſo much dreaded, Hoſt; and the Event of it in their total Defeat. Other Circumſtances of that Battle might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have convey'd to us a clearer Idea of the Conduct and Bravery of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but could not have given us ſo lively an one of the Diſplay of the Divine Power, in favour of his People, as the repreſenting him here as the ſole Author of the whole Tranſaction; and aſcribing the whole Glory of it, where it was moſt juſtly due.</p>
               <p>However, as <hi>Gilgal,</hi> the ſtanding Camp of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was at too great a Diſtance from the Waters of <hi>Merom,</hi> where the Confederate Forces were rendezvous'd, for <hi>Joſhua</hi> to reach it in ſo ſhort a time; whether we ſuppoſe the latter to be the <hi>Samachonitiſh</hi> Lake, or,

as I ſhall ſhew by-and-by, ſome Plain much nearer than the former; it were abſurd to ſuppoſe the Divine Promiſe to have been made to him before his decamping from it, and not rather upon his being come within a ſhort Day's March from, if not in full View of, the Enemy's Army. The Text ſeems plainly to be in favour of this latter Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for <hi>Joſhua</hi> could hardly, before that time, be ſo ſufficiently appriſed of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Strength, as to want this freſh Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance from God: Neither will Reaſon permit us to think, that ſo old and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced a General would have ſuffered ſuch a grand Confederacy to be made againſt him, without uſing all poſſible Expedition to go and oppoſe them; eſpecially as ſo great a Tract of South <hi>Canaan,</hi> which he had lately conquered, lay between him and them; and being now, in ſome meaſure, deſtitute of its old Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, might have eaſily become a Prey to them.</p>

                  </note>; which, if true, plainly ſhews that thoſe Places muſt have been much nearer to each other; and conſequently, that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> Waters here ſpoken of could not be the <hi>Samachonitiſh</hi> Lake above-mentioned, as ſome Commentators conjecture; for neither could ſuch an Army, as his muſt be ſuppoſed to have been, have reached it in twice that time, it being, as I hinted before, above an hundred Miles over high Mountains, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Paſſes: Nor is it likely, that the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Army would chooſe that for the Place of their Rendezvous; it being almoſt at the fartheſt End, North of their Country; and have left ſo vaſt a Territory on the South ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>What hath given Birth to that Miſtake is, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentions the City of <hi>Hazor,</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0177700400:255"/>
the Capital of <hi>Jabin,</hi> the chief of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Kings, as ſituate upon that Lake; but, beſides that he doth not hint any thing like the Battle having been fought there, is it not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſurd to ſuppoſe, that ſo politic a King, and who was the chief Promoter of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, ſhould chooſe his own Territory to be the Scene of War; and a Plain, ſo near his Metropolis; for the Field of Battle? Is it not much more reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that both he, and his Allies, would haſte all they could, to meet the Enemy, before he could penetrate into any of their Territories? Hence it is generally concluded, that the <hi>Merom,</hi> here ſpoken of, is the ſame which <hi>Euſebius</hi> calls <hi>Merus,</hi> and places at about twelve Miles Diſtance from <hi>Sebaſte,</hi> or <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> towards <hi>Dothaim,</hi> and on this Side of the Torrent of <hi>Kiſhon,</hi> and in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> and the Waters of <hi>Megiddo,</hi> and the City of <hi>Thaanach:</hi> For upon that ſame Spot it was, that was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fought the famous Battle between <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera,</hi> General of <hi>Jabin,</hi> King of <hi>Hazor,</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chief, about 150 Years after; in which the former, tho' vaſtly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,

was totally cut off<note n="i" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Judg.</hi> iv. <hi>paſſ.</hi> v. 19.</note>. For there was a very important Paſs, which guarded the Entrance into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Phoenice;</hi> or from thence into South <hi>Canaan.</hi> It was therefore of the utmoſt Conſequence to the Confederates to ſecure it, ſeeing the Loſs of it would open, as it actually did, after their Defeat, a Way into all the Northern Part, which they inhabited, quite into upper <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee.</hi> Now this Spot being at moſt but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fifty or ſixty Miles from <hi>Gilgal,</hi> it was eaſy for <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and his Army, to reach it in leſs than five Days, conſidering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious Way which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had of marching their Armies, not only in different Columns, more or leſs numerous, as the Ground would allow, but even in ſmall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whenever they could do it ſafe from the Attacks and Inſults of their Enemies; as they could, on this particular Occaſion, through all the South Part of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where they had already deſtroyed all that could poſſibly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy them; and had, in all Probability, left here and there a Gariſon, at proper Places, to ſecure either their March, or a Retreat,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0177700400:257"/>
in caſe of Need. For it is to be obſerved here, that they were encumbered with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Artillery nor Baggage, that could retard their Speed. They took nothing with them but their Arms, which were either the Sling. Sword, Lance, or Bow; all light of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; beſides their Proviſions; which, being chiefly of the dry Kind, as Bread, parched Corn, Peas, dried Figs, Raiſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they eaſily carried a ſufficient Quantity about them, for the preſent Occaſion; or, in caſe of a long March, they had their Aſſes, Mules, and other Beaſts of Carriage, for the Purpoſe; by which means they marched, with a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Expedition; from one End of the Country to the other. But of this I ſhall give as remarkable an Inſtance, in the laſt of theſe Eſſays, as is to be met with in any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, either antient or modern. I muſt ſtill add one peculiar Advantage they had, in this reſpect, above other Nations, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Diſcipline eſtabliſhed among them by their inſpired Lawgiver, and improved by his worthy Succeſſor, the preſent <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chief, <hi>Joſhua;</hi> and that was, that every Man that was able to bear Arms, that is, from twenty to ſixty Years of Age, was obliged to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0177700400:258"/>
in the Muſter-Roll of his own Tribe, and to appear under the Standard of it, with his Proviſions, and military Accoutrements, upon the firſt Summons, under the ſevereſt Penalties. Theſe Muſter-Rolls were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerved, not only by every Tribe; but a general one of the Whole was likewiſe to be kept in the Hands of the chief Judge, or General. The former of thoſe Rolls was to be called over at the Head of each reſpective Tribe, to ſee that none were abſent, but ſuch as were detained by ſome unavoidable Impediment, as Sickneſs, Lameneſs, and the like. Here, likewiſe, as many as had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Wife, built a new Houſe, planted a Vineyard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within the Year, having made good their Claim before the Head of the Tribe, were likewiſe diſmiſſed to their own Home, and ſet down as ſuch in the Muſter-Book: After which the reſt were to march to the Place of Rendezvous, under their reſpective Heads of Thouſands, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and Fifties. Here their Names were called afreſh, to ſee whether any were miſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and then the whole Amount was given to the head Commander. So that there could hardly be any that dared deſert from his
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0177700400:259"/>
Colours, becauſe they knew not whither to go without Danger, no other Tribe daring to admit them within their Roll; and they being branded in their own for Run-aways, and liable to be puniſhed with Death, as ſoon as found. They had ſtill another pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Tie; <hi>viz.</hi> their Family: For all the Men were obliged to marry ſoon after they had attained to their twentieth Year, and were generally fruitful. But in caſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, ſhould they by good Chance have eſcaped from being taken, yet they muſt be for ever baniſhed from their Parents, Wives, and Children; beſides living, perhaps, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Servitude, in a ſtrange Place, and in conſtant Fear of being diſcovered. To have fled into an Enemy's Country for Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was not only equally dangerous, but much more dreaded; becauſe that reſcinded them from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Apoſtates; which was eſteemed the greateſt Curſe that could befal them. Upon all theſe Accounts, Deſertion was ſo rare, that they could truſt their Men to march through their own Country, without that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Regularity, which was commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by other Nations; and, on all Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0177700400:260"/>
that required a more than ordinary Expedition, permit them to divide themſelves into ſmall Bodies, go over Mountains, or fetch a Compaſs about, or take any other Method, that would bring them ſooneſt to the Place of Rendezvous. It was, therefore, by this excellent Diſcipline, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Armies, tho' ſometimes very numerous, were able to make ſuch ſurpriſing quick Marches, either over Mountains and Defiles, or by fetching a Compaſs about, as to come upon their Enemies, when they leaſt dreamed of their being ſo nigh; and by attacking them on the ſudden, on two, or three, ſometimes on all, Sides, in diſtinct Bodies, to give them a total Overthrow. Upon the Whole then, though <hi>Gilgal</hi> was at leaſt an hundred Miles Diſtance from <hi>Hazor,</hi> the Capital of the chiefeſt of the confederate Kings; yet the Text tells us, that when theſe laſt were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together, they marched their Army to the Waters of <hi>Merom,</hi> in order to engage the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>

                  <hi>Kiſhon,</hi> or, as they are elſewhere ſtiled, the Waters of <hi>Megiddo.</hi> To this I beg Leave to add one Argument more; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Joſhua</hi> is ſaid, in the Text, to have purſued the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, after their Defeat, to <hi>Great Zidon,</hi> to <hi>Mizrephoth-majim,</hi> and to the Valley of <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> on the Eaſt. Now that <hi>Mizpeh</hi> was in the Tract of Mount <hi>Gilead,</hi> is plain from the Story of <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who gave it both thoſe Names <hi>(Geneſ.</hi> xxxi. 49.): And it is as plain, that it lies Eaſtward of the Waters of <hi>Merom,</hi> or Torrent of <hi>Kiſhon,</hi> but full South from the Lake <hi>Samachon;</hi> and therefore this laſt could not be the Waters of <hi>Merom,</hi> mentioned in the Text, but thoſe of the River <hi>Kiſhon</hi>
                  <note n="C" place="bottom">To this there can be but one thing objected; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Text places <hi>Mizpeh</hi> under Mount <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
                     <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Joſh.</hi> xi. 3.</note>, which lies above Fifty Miles North of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead,</hi> and North-eaſt of the <hi>Samachonitiſh</hi> Lake; ſo that it cannot be that in the Land of <hi>Gilead;</hi> for, according to that Situation, it lies Eaſt from the Lake, and from <hi>Zidon,</hi> as the Text places it, in the 8th Verſe. But, allowing that, it will not follow, that the Battle was fought near that Lake; but that <hi>Jabin,</hi> King of <hi>Hazor,</hi> prevailed on all the Nations, from the <hi>Hittites</hi> that lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Mount, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently were ſituate the fartheſt North from South <hi>Canaan,</hi> quite down to thoſe who inhabited the South Parts, from the Lake <hi>Genezareth</hi> Eaſtward, to the Borders of <hi>Dor</hi> on the Weſt, to join in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with him; that is, that he engaged all the Nations about him, quite to the very Borders of South <hi>Canaan,</hi> to engage in that War. In Revenge of which, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> having totally defeated them, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them to the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Part of their reſpective Territories; that is, to <hi>Mizrephoth-majim</hi> Weſt, to <hi>Zidon</hi> North, and to this <hi>Mizpeh</hi> under <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Eaſtward: Which I gladly ſubſcribe to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Text obſerves, that after he had purſued them thus far North, he turned back, and took and burned the City of <hi>Hazor</hi>

                        <hi>Joſh.</hi> xi. 10.</note>. But this cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what I have ſaid, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Field of Battle, or of <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s attacking the Enemy by diſtinct Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but rather confirms it.</note>. And accordingly we
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0177700400:262"/>
find <hi>Zidon</hi> on the North of that River; and the <hi>Mizrephoth-majim,</hi> the other Place where <hi>Joſhua</hi> purſued them, may be reaſonably ſuppoſed to have lain Weſtward towards the Sea. For the Word ſignifies the Burnings of Waters; and is commonly underſtood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Salt-pits, or melting of Sand to make Glaſs. And both theſe Manufactures were carried on, along the Weſtern Coaſts, about <hi>Acra,</hi> or <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> but eſpecially the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the Sand of the River <hi>Belus,</hi> which falls into the Sea not far from it, being reckoned

excellent for that Uſe, and ſaid to have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred the firſt Hint to that Invention.</p>
               <p>Here then we have the three Points to which he purſued them; <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> Eaſtward; to <hi>Zidon,</hi> Northward; and to <hi>Mizrephoth-majim,</hi> Weſtward: For the South being already conquered, it is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they would venture to flee to any Part of it. We may therefore reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this was the Scene of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Action; and that it lay near the Confines of both: And I think it highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the River <hi>Kiſhon</hi> did, at this time, divide the Southern <hi>Canaan,</hi> conquered by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> from the Northern, ſtill unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; and hither it was that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chief led his Forces to oppoſe them<note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Joſh.</hi> xi. 7.</note>; and there it was that he gained the ſignal Victory, mentioned a little after, which enabled him, in four or five Years, to complete the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the whole Northern Tract<note n="m" place="bottom">

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>There remains but one Difficulty unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; and that is, How <hi>Joſhua,</hi> with his
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0177700400:264"/>
ſmall flying Army, for ſuch it might juſtly be deemed, in compariſon of that of the Confederates, could give them ſuch a total Overthrow, and chaſe them ſo many differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Ways, and at ſo great a Diſtance from each other; and cut them off, that none of them ſhould remain, but thoſe few that fled into fortified Cities; burn all their warlike Chariots; hamſtring their Horſes; and open to himſelf a Way thro' all that hilly Country, quite to the City of <hi>Hazor,</hi> which ſtood above fifty Miles farther North; without meeting, that we read of, any farther Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from the Enemy? But here likewiſe the ſacred Hiſtorian wholly aſcribes the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the whole Expedition to God, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up that numerous Hoſt into his Hand<note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Joſh.</hi> xi. 8.</note>; and leaves us to gueſs at the Methods which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> General took to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, by ſome few Hints interſperſed, as it were accidentally, in the Text; but yet ſufficient to remove all Appearance of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability in the Relation.</p>
               <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> then, As to the prodigious Superiority of the Confederates, with reſpect to Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0177700400:265"/>
it is univerſally allowed to be a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, rather than Advantage; not only as it is apt to inſpire them with too much Confidence, Security, and Negligence; but likewiſe, as it often proves an unwieldy and dead Weight; eſpecially when engaged againſt a General, who knows how to chooſe his Ground, ſo as to render the greater Part of it uſeleſs; for the Truth of which we need not ſeek for a more pregnant Inſtance, than in the two Armies of <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Alexander the Great.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> By the Hint the Text gives us, of <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s purſuing the flying Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, quite to <hi>Great Zidon,</hi> to <hi>Mizrephoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>majim,</hi> and to the Valley of <hi>Mizpeh;</hi> and ſmiting them, till none remained; that is, as the Text plainly imports, till none remained undiſperſed; we may draw this very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inference from it; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Joſhua</hi> had divided his Army into ſeveral diſtinct Bodies, both to attack them on different Sides, and to purſue and kill thoſe that fled: For that was a Method much in vogue in thoſe antient times, ſeeing we find it practiſed as early as the time of <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Geneſis</hi> xiv. 15.</note>. Another Remark
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0177700400:266"/>
I would make on thoſe flying and ſeparate Bodies, is, that they generally aimed at, and were deſigned to ſurpriſe, the Enemy, and fall unexpectedly upon them on as many Sides as they could; by which means ſuch a ſudden Panic was generally convey'd from the Out-guards to the main Body of the Army, as ſeldom failed of being attended with their total Overthrow. The many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind of ſucceſsful Stratagems, in <hi>Barak, Gideon, Saul,</hi> and other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chiefs; and among the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> in later Ages; are not only ſtanding Proofs of its Uſe and Excellence, but give us a moral Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who was ſo well verſed in all the Arts of War, would not omit put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this in Practice, whenever a fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offered. And where can the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be, that ſuch a vaſt Army as that of the Confederates, who, in all Likelihood, lay negligently encamped, truſting chiefly in their Number and Strength, ſhould afford him ſuch an one as he could wiſh; eſpecially if he took the Opportunity of coming upon them in the Night, and attacking them upon the firſt Dawn of the Day? Did not <hi>Gideon,</hi> with his three hundred Men, by much the ſame
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0177700400:267"/>
well-concerted Stratagem, inject an univerſal Panic into the numerous Hoſt of <hi>Midian, Amalek,</hi> and their Confederates, in the Dead of Night; and diſcomfit them on the next Morning<note n="q" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> xiv. <hi>paſſ.</hi>
                  </note>? For, in the general Confuſion and Miſtruſt that reigned through thoſe numerous Hoſts, which was ſtill much greater, when they conſiſted of various Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether Confederates or Auxiliaries, they commonly fell foul upon one another, with ſuch deſperate Fury, that the Enemy had little elſe to do, but to ſtand ſtill and ſee them ſheath their Weapons into each other's
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0177700400:268"/>
Side. How much more grievous muſt the Horror and Deſpair of theſe Northern <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> be, at this unhappy Juncture, to ſee themſelves ſurpriſed, and on all Sides ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with ſuch an irreſiſtible Enemy; all the Union of their Confederacy at once broken; their Politics defeated; and their united Force diſſolved; by the univerſal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt and Dread which reigns among them; whilſt every Nation, I might almoſt ſay eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Individual, forgetting the Ties of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Alliance, can think on nothing but of ſeeking their own Safety, by the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſperate means? Such, I believe, will eaſily be allowed to be the neceſſary Conſequence of ſuch ill-concerted Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, when acting in Oppoſition to a Force, which, how inferior ſoever in Number, is ſo ſtrongly cemented by one common Intereſt; directed by a wiſe and experienced Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; kept up by a good martial Diſcipline; and inſpirited with ſuch frequent Divine Aſſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Victory. What Wonder is there then, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Army, with ſo many great Advantages, nay, with every Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage but that of Numbers, if that be really one, ſhould thus totally rout and diſperſe that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0177700400:269"/>
of ſo many ill-united and intimidated Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates; make ſuch a dreadful Slaughter among them that fled; purſue them to the very farthermoſt Borders of their reſpective Territories; and, in their Return, make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of every Part of that Northern Tract? But we may further remember, that immediately after their ſignal Defeat, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> cutting off all the Men that he could come at, hamſtringing all their Horſes, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their Chariots, in which it is likely their chief Strength conſiſted, put it wholly out of their Power to make any farther De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt him.</p>
               <p>The only Difficulty that can be ſtarted, therefore, againſt this ſignal Tranſaction, is, that ſuch a numerous Hoſt, as that of the Confederates, who had with them ſuch Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Horſe, and warlike Chariots, and could ſend Scouts enough abroad, to give them Intelligence of what paſſed, ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be ſurpriſed by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chief; and, what is more amazing, by an old threadbare Stratagem, that had been in Uſe even ſince <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Days; and had been ſo lately practiſed with Succeſs by him

in the Relief of <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and the Defeat of the confederate Army of <hi>Canaanites,</hi> that were then beſieging it on all Sides. Was not all this enough to put them upon keeping a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Guard around them than uſual, to avoid the like Surprize? To this I anſwer, That nothing is more common, than for ſuch large Armies to truſt ſo far to their Numbers, Strength, advantageous Situation, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of their Camp, as to become quite negligent of this main Point. We meet with numberleſs Inſtances of this, both in ſacred and profane Hiſtory; and ſome of them of a much more modern Date. Theſe Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, having formed their ſeveral Camps in the propereſt manner, and, as is moſt likely, ſurrounded them with their armed Chariots, perhaps two or three Rows deep, and poſted their Vanguards about them, might think themſelves ſufficiently ſecured from any ſudden Attack, without troubling themſelves about any further Precautions. This was the Caſe, we find, above 200 Years after, of the confederate <hi>Midianites, Amalek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> and their Eaſtern Allies; whom the ſacred Hiſtorian repreſents as lying negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcattered about like Locuſts, when <hi>Gideon</hi>

fell ſuddenly upon them, in the Night, and gave them ſuch a total Overthrow, that they dared not ſhew their Faces againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for ſome Scores of Years after<note n="u" place="bottom">

               <p>But, 2<hi>dly, Joſhua,</hi> who was become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all South <hi>Canaan,</hi> might eaſily put it out of the Power of the Enemy to receive any Intelligence of his Approach, by cauſing all the Paſſes and Defiles to be cloſely guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For, as I obſerved before, the Battle was fought near the Frontiers, between North and South <hi>Canaan;</hi> though on which Side I will not pretend to affirm. It was eaſy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent their Scouts, or even any of his Deſerters, if any ſuch there had been, to bring them Notice of his March or Route: So that hearing nothing from any Side, they might eaſily imagine that he dared not come to attack them.</p>

3<hi>dly,</hi> I likewiſe obſerved, that he uſually marched his Army in different Columns; and that not only for the ſake of Expedition, but likewiſe that he might attack the Enemy on different Sides. It was eaſy therefore for him to order one Corps to march towards them, by the neareſt Way, but ſomewhat more ſlowly; whilſt he ordered the reſt of his Army to fetch a Compaſs about, both on the Right and Left; and, by a ſpeedier March, to arrive time enough to fall unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly upon them, on the Flank or Rear, whilſt theſe attacked them in Front; which could not fail of throwing them into Diſorder and Confuſion. Let me add, that ſuppoſing their Camp ever ſo well fortified, <hi>Joſhua</hi> had ſtill another Stratagem to play againſt them, as he had lately done to the Inhabitants of <hi>Ai</hi>

               <p>By all therefore that hath been ſaid upon this memorable Tranſaction, you may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

ſee, that there was nothing done in it, but what might have been performed by any other experienced Chief, in the common martial Way of Conqueſt; tho' he had never been favoured with ſuch Encouragements, and Aſſurances of Succeſs, as God was pleaſed ſo frequently to give to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and his Troops. It is therefore no Wonder, that the ſacred Writers, inſtead of dwelling on a long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of the Arts and Stratagems that were uſed by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chiefs, chooſe rather to aſcribe the whole Glory of all their ſignal Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and the happy Conſequences of them, to the Divine Providence, that ſo viſibly proſpered their Arms; ſince it was chiefly owing to their ſure Truſt and Confidence in thoſe repeated Aſſurances, that they fought ſo valiantly and ſucceſsfully againſt Enemies that wholly relied on their Number and Strength, and on the Aſſiſtance of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Deities; and who, by their deteſtable Worſhip of them, had not only forfeited all Title to the Protection of God, but had made themſelves worthy of his moſt ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Nevertheleſs it would be abſurd to infer from thence, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> neglected any
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0177700400:274"/>
Art or Stratagem, that could either ſecure or facilitate the promiſed Conqueſt; for that were an Abuſe of, rather than a Reliance on, the Divine Aſſiſtance; and ſuch as we have no Reaſon to ſuſpect him to have been capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. If therefore thoſe Arts and Means are not recorded in the Text, it cannot be ſuppoſed to be done with any other View, than to intimate to us the ſmall Efficacy they muſt all have had, without ſuch a ſteady Reliance on the one Side, and God's Bleſſing on the other; than which nothing could be more proper to keep up their Confidence in him, and to fill them with the moſt grateful Senſe, for all the Succeſs they had hitherto, or ſhould hereafter be bleſſed with; whilſt, on the other hand, inſtead of arrogating any Share of the Glory of it, they looked upon themſelves only as the mere Inſtruments of his Providence, and Executors of his Divine Will. Agreeable to this was that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Precaution which he was pleaſed to take, on a like Occaſion, with regard to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> and his 30,000 Men, when he made him diſmiſs them, all but 300 tried Men; <hi>viz.</hi> leſt they ſhould boaſt, that their own

But here I am aware of an Objection, that will hardly fail of being ſtarted by your Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, as it hath been by many others, in the ſame Way of thinking; <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch Stratagems for ſurpriſing and routing an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, cannot but appear below the Character of thoſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chiefs, and much more ſo of the Divine Providence, that is ſaid to have directed and proſpered them; eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how deſpicably all ſuch Artifices were looked upon by the <hi>Romans, Celtes, Gauls, Greeks,</hi> and other warlike Nations; ſome of which were ſo far from ſeeking to ſurpriſe their Enemies, that they appriſed them of the Time and Place where they deſigned to attack them<note n="a" place="bottom">

ſo diſhonourable, or below the Character of the greateſt Monarch or General: On the contrary, it cannot be thought inglorious in them to uſe all proper means to ſave the Lives of as many of their Subjects as they can, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Victory, that is not gained with this Advantage, may prove too dearly bought; and be, perhaps, as diſhonourable and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous as a Defeat. <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in the Caſe before us, was to engage, with his ſmall fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army of Foot, an Hoſt of Confederates, as numerous as the Sand on the Sea-ſhore, together with a numerous Cavalry, and armed Chariots<note n="c" place="bottom">

What could therefore more become his Valour, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried Experience, or turn more to his Glory, than contriving the moſt effectual means to deſtroy as many as he could of the one, and to ſave all he could of the other? Or where would his Advantage have been, if the Loſs of each of his Men had been attended with that of twenty of the Enemy, at ſo great a Diſtance from his main Camp? As to what
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0177700400:278"/>
we are told of the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Nations, ſcorning to fight upon ſuch unequal Terms, or to gain a Victory by Artifice, Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, or Surprize, or any other means, but by dint of Strength and Courage; it is well, if all this was not rather ſaid by way of wiping off the Scandal of ſome ſignal Defeats they had met with, from ſome more vigilant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Commander, than they chanced to have at thoſe times. For we are not without fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Inſtances of their Generals having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves to be overthrown by ſuch kind of Surprizes and Stratagems; which might put them under a Neceſſity of uſing them afterwards, if it be really true, that they did not at firſt. For nothing is more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, than that in After-times they not only put in Practice all Kinds of Stratagems, but even of Treachery, againſt thoſe brave antient Nations, both in and out of <hi>Italy,</hi> which they, by degrees, brought under their Yoke<note n="d" place="bottom">

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0177700400:279"/>
without Artifice or Stratagem, we need not wonder ſo much, that his unbounded Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, of being thought the invincible Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> did not permit him to deſcend to ſuch low and derogatory Arts; but how he would have acted againſt more warlike Nations, may be eaſily gueſſed at, ſeeing all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that one Caſe excepted, were but one continued Series of the moſt deeply concerted Arts and Stratagems againſt the Liberties and Properties of ſo many Nations, over which he had neither Title nor Claim; and that frequently at the Expence of his own faithful <hi>Macedonian</hi> Troops, whoſe Lives he was juſtly blamed for being as laviſh of, as our <hi>Hebrew</hi> Heroes were careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe of their own. In a Word, therefore, I can ſee nothing in theſe martial Artifices, but what is highly agreeable to the Character of the nobleſt Generals, or to the juſteſt Notions we can conceive of the Divine Providence; whilſt they were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concerted for the Preſervation of ſo many Lives, appointed, ſeveral Centuries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be the happy Poſſeſſors of this fertile Land, and muſt have been loſt by a more equal Warfare; and, at the ſame time, gave

Thouſands of the diſmayed <hi>Canaanites,</hi> when recovered from their Panic, an Opportunity of conſulting their mutual Safety by a timely Retreat, unleſs reſolutely bent upon their own Deſtruction.

                     <hi>Judg.</hi> xix. 1. xxi. 25.</note>. To which give me Leave to add, that in this the <hi>Benjamites</hi> did but too plainly verify the Prophecy of their dying Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that fierce and untractable Tribe<note n="g" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Vid. int. al.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii. 8. 12, <hi>&amp; ſeq. &amp; alib. paſſ.</hi>
                  </note>. But in this, and the like Caſes, it were unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to draw any Inference from the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and irregular Actions of a Tribe or People, to the leſſening of the Authority of the Writer of any Hiſtory, who ought rather to be admired for the Impartiality with
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0177700400:288"/>
which he relates a Fact ſo little to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his Nation.</p>
               <p>The main Difficulty therefore which you are concerned to remove, with reſpect to the bloody War of the eleven Tribes againſt that of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> is neither the unnatural Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the <hi>Gibeathites</hi> to the <hi>Levite,</hi> and his Concubine; nor that of that whole Tribe, in refuſing to ſurrender thoſe brutiſh Wretches to condign Puniſhment: For how ſtrange ſoever either of them may appear, yet is there nothing in it either improbable, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Degeneracy of thoſe times, and the Character of that haughty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable Tribe. Neither will there any thing appear extraordinary in that laudable Zeal, which the other Tribes ſo unanimouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on this Occaſion; nor in the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution they took of puniſhing thoſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants with the utmoſt Severity; when we call to mind how expreſly this had been commanded them by God, to the utter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of thoſe that ſhould be found guilty of ſuch vile Abominations<note n="i" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid. Deut.</hi> xiii. 12, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> xxiii. 17. <hi>Levit.</hi> xviii. 22. xx. 13. <hi>&amp; alib. paſſ.</hi>
                  </note>. And it was
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0177700400:289"/>
on account of that, among many other cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sins, that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were doomed to utter Deſtruction; which Puniſhment was no leſs ſeverely denounced againſt the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> that ſhould be found guilty of them. It would have, indeed, been more ſurpriſing, if, in a Caſe of this Nature, they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed leſs Warmth and Abhorrence than they did, not only againſt the brutiſh Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators of that unnatural Deed, but much more againſt the more wicked <hi>Benjamites,</hi> for patronizing it, inſtead of ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the moſt forward in puniſhing it.</p>
               <p>The chief Difficulty therefore remaining, that is really ſuch, and that no ſmall one in your Opponent's Eye, lieth in accounting for the ill Succeſs that attended the laudable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the eleven Tribes, and for their being ſo ſhamefully repulſed, and with ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a Loſs; eſpecially after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Divine Oracle about this War, and received ſuch an encouraging Anſwer from it, as could hardly be interpreted to import leſs than a Promiſe of a complete Victory, as a due Reward for their Zeal: Whilſt, to their great Mortification and Aſtoniſhment, they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0177700400:290"/>
ſee the Arms of that impious and untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tribe crowned with an undeſerved Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Theſe are the ſtrong Terms in which your Opponent couches his Objection: In which, however, he ſeems to overlook two material Points, amiſs, in their Behaviour, on this important and extraordinary Occaſion; namely, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> However laudable and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law their Intention might be, to puniſh the impious <hi>Gibeathites</hi> with the utmoſt Severity; yet this ſudden and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Reſolution, of declaring an offenſive War againſt the whole Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> appears plainly enough, by all Circumſtances, to have been the Effect of their Reſentment againſt it, for daring to oppoſe themſelves, in Defence of ſuch Miſcreants, againſt the whole <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Congregation, rather than the Reſult of a cool, ſincere, and deliberate Debate, about the moſt effectual Means to extirpate ſuch ſhameful Impieties out of their Commonwealth. Had they given themſelves time to think coolly upon it, they muſt have remembred, that if it was not permitted to them to declare War, even againſt Strangers, without conſulting the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracle, that is, the High-Prieſt, by
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0177700400:291"/>
                  <hi>Urim;</hi> much leſs was it for them, not only to reſolve, but to bind themſelves by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath, to engage in one againſt one of their own Tribes; and to purſue it with ſuch furious Zeal. For it is plain, however your Antagoniſt may have overlooked it, that they never once thought of conſulting the Divine Will, or, as the inſpired Writers commonly word it, of <hi>inquiring of,</hi> or <hi>aſking Counſel of, the LORD,</hi> till the War was unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly reſolved upon, and ſworn to. And then it was not to inquire about the Fitneſs or Lawfulneſs of it, for that they took for granted; but only which Tribe ſhould have the Poſt of Honour, and the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in this hoſtile Expedition; that no Jarring or Diſpute about it might obſtruct the Execution or Succeſs of it. The other Circumſtance which your Opponent hath overlooked, is, that the Divine Oracle, or, as is commonly underſtood, the Anſwer of the High-Prieſt by <hi>Urim,</hi> only informs them, that the Preference inquired after is due to the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> But this Anſwer was not attended with any Promiſe of Succeſs<note n="k" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Judg.</hi> xx. 18, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0177700400:292"/>
which was rather expected by them as a thing of courſe, or as the natural Conſequence of ſo picus and laudable an Enterprize. The Cauſe, they ſo far rightly judged, was God's; how could they ſuppoſe that it would end in their Defeat? They were ſuperior by far in Number to the rebellious Tribe; how ſhould they then expect any thing but Victory? In this Perſuaſion and Confidence, they never inquire whether God will bleſs them with one, but only aſk who ſhall lead them to it: And this it was that proved the Cauſe of their firſt Defeat; and that juſtly too, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Puniſhment for their Preſumption, in raſhly decreeing the Exciſion of a Tribe, without either conſulting God's Will about it, or trying ſome previous Method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to Reaſon, by more pacific means: For this was, in Fact, making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Judges and Executioners in God's Cauſe, without his Authority, Advice, or Conſent. To this I may add, what the <hi>Jews</hi> farther allege againſt them, that they fought his Cauſe with unhallowed, or with Hands as guilty as thoſe of that rebellious Tribe; in ſuffering a new Kind of Idolatry to be ſet and kept up amongſt them; if they were
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0177700400:293"/>
not, for the moſt part, infected with it<note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid. Judg.</hi> xviii. 30, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>; and which it was their Duty to have extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, before they preſumed to draw their Swords in God's Cauſe, upon any other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. This is, indeed, the more probable, becauſe not only the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> but moſt other Chronologers, place the ſetting up of <hi>Micah</hi>'s Idol, in their new <hi>Dan,</hi> much about the ſame time that this War happened; both Tranſactions being diſtinguiſhed by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtorian<note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> xvii. 6. xviii. 1. xix. 1. xxi. 25.</note>, that they happened when <hi>there was no King in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but every one did what was right in his own Eyes.</hi> In this State therefore of Anarchy and Apoſtaſy, how little Reaſon had they to expect a Bleſſing on a Zeal ſo partial and blind; which, in all Likelihood, would have been as cold and unactive againſt <hi>Benjamin,</hi> as againſt <hi>Dan,</hi> had it not been blown up into a Fury againſt the former, partly by the then unheard of Circumſtance of a Concubine hewn and diſpatched in Pieces to the Tribes, and partly by the more ſurpriſing Reſolution of the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> to ſtand in the Defence of the brutiſh <hi>Gibeathites!</hi> And in this Caſe,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0177700400:294"/>
how could they be more effectually brought to a juſter Way of Thinking, than by their being ſuffered to meet with a ſignal Defeat, where they expected nothing leſs than a complete Victory? Accordingly, we find, that the firſt Diſcomfiture brings them to their Tears and Prayers; they now begin to conſult God, not about a General, but about the Lawfulneſs of the War; and, upon their finding it approved by him<note n="n" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Judg.</hi> xx. 23, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>

               <p>It will not be amiſs here to obſerve, that the Phraſe here uſed, upon both theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, of aſking Counſel of the Lord, doth often mean no more, than conſulting their grand Council, or <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> with the High-Prieſt at their Head; and theſe were the proper Judges of all ſuch things; and whoſe Sentence was of equal Force, though not ſo infallibly ſure, as if it had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Divine Oracle<note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> xvi. 18, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> xvii. 11, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>. So that it was no leſs than a capital Crime to refuſe to abide by their Determination. And this is
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0177700400:295"/>
all the Inquiry and Application which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſeem to have made upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; <hi>viz.</hi> They firſt inquired of this grand Council, then ſolemnly aſſembled, who ſhould have the Command of the Army; and, upon their being unexpectedly defeated, they conſulted them about the Lawfulneſs of the War, which they now began to fear was diſpleaſing to God; ſince they had ſucceeded no better on their firſt Onſet. For as to their conſulting the Lord, in the uſual ſolemn Form, that is, by the <hi>Urim,</hi> and before the Ark, and the High-Prieſt, it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, from the Tenor of the Text, that they thought of it till after their ſecond Defeat: For then it is plainly ſaid, that <hi>all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>even all the People, went up unto the Houſe of God; where they not only faſted and wept until the Evening,</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced their Addreſs to him, with the uſual Sacrifice of Burnt and Peace Offerings; upon which <hi>Phinehas,</hi> the then High-Prieſt, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Ark, aſked Counſel, with the uſual Solemnity, in their Name; ſaying, <hi>Shall I go once more to Battle againſt the Children of</hi> Benjamin <hi>my Brother, or ſhall I ceaſe?</hi> And received this favourable Anſwer from
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0177700400:296"/>

                  </note>; as he accordingly did, to the almoſt total Extirpation of that rebellious Tribe<note n="q" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. ad fin.</hi>
                  </note>. Upon the Whole, therefore, the two firſt Battles, in which <hi>Iſrael</hi> loſt 40,000 Men, may be juſtly looked upon as their raſh and inconſiderate Act and Deed; in which, whatever Countenance may be ſuppoſed to have been given to that Enterprize, whether by God, or by the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> yet it was ſtill without any Promiſe of Succeſs; and I may add, without any juſt Grounds to hope for it, from any thing that might be inferred from the two firſt Anſwers, and much leſs from their irregular Way of Proceeding, in a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that great and univerſal Concern. But now that God is not only applied to in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Way, and prevailed upon by the Prayers and Tears, the Sacrifices, and other Acts of Humiliation, of the whole People, to give them a more encouraging Promiſe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Hoſtilities with more Caution and Regularity: <hi>Benjamin</hi> is ſoon made to pay dearly, not only for the Lives of the 40,000 they had ſlain, on the two former Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0177700400:297"/>
but likewiſe for their daring to take up Arms in Defence of the impious <hi>Gibeathites;</hi> whilſt the Fire conſumes the Cities, and the Sword the Lives, of thoſe rebellious Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants: Inſomuch that the whole Tribe is now reduced to about 600 fugitive Deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, who went and fortified themſelves upon a barren Rock<note n="r" place="bottom">

               <p>But there was ſtill another, and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, Effect to be feared, from their too raſh and precipitate Zeal againſt the <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> at firſt; <hi>viz.</hi> the general and ſolemn Curſe they had pronounced againſt any one that ſhould give his Daughter in Marriage to any of that rebellious Tribe, whilſt they had ſuffered their furious Zeal to tranſport them ſo far, as to deſtroy all their Females; ſo that the ſparing of theſe 600 Men could be
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0177700400:298"/>
of little Service towards the ſaving of that Tribe from periſhing, unleſs they could alſo find them Wives, on whom to beget a new Offspring. In this Perplexity they return all to <hi>Bethel,</hi> filling the Air with their Cries, about the Feet of the Ark; but come not ſo much to inquire of God, whether the Oath they had thus raſhly ſworn was lawful or no; and if the latter, whether he would not in Mercy forgive and diſpenſe them from it, as to expoſtulate, in a kind of tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with him, for ſuffering them to bind themſelves by it, to the endangering the Loſs of one of their Tribes. <hi>Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, ſay they, <hi>why is this come to paſs, that there ſhould be To-day a Tribe lacking in</hi> Iſrael? They proceed next to offer new Sacrifices and Burnt-offerings, and to implore his Pity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poor Remains of that once flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Tribe: But as the Text takes no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their conſulting him in the uſual Form, nor of their receiving any Direction from the High-Prieſt, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, either that they omitted that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, or that God refuſed to give them any Direction, how they ſhould act upon
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0177700400:299"/>
that Emergency. For we meet with ſome ſuch Inſtances in Scripture, in which God has thought fit to ſuſpend his Anſwer, when thus aſked, in the uſual Form; and upon perhaps a leſs provoking Occaſion than this, as he did, ſome time after, to <hi>Saul,</hi> upon his Son <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s having incurred his Curſe, by taſting of the forbidden Honey<note n="u" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid. int. al.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xiv. 37.</note>: And this, not ſo much, in all Probability, to ſhew his Diſpleaſure for a Tranſgreſſion unwittingly committed, as to inſpire the People with a deeper Senſe of his all-ſeeing Eye, who would not ſuffer even ſo ſmall and inconſiderable a Fault to paſs by uncenſured. Something pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to this, tho' more aggravated, we may reckon the concealed Theft of <hi>Achan;</hi> for which, not only the guilty Perſon, but the reſt of the People, were puniſhed with an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Defeat before <hi>Ai</hi>

                  </note>; tho' altogether ignorant of it, till it was diſcovered to them by the <hi>Urim;</hi> whereas, in the Caſe before us, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not but be ſenſible, both of the Raſhneſs and Unlawfulneſs of the Oath which they had taken againſt <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min;</hi> and, now the Fury of their Zeal againſt
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0177700400:300"/>
them was abated by the great Slaughter they had made of them, had ſtill leſs Reaſon to aſk or expect an Anſwer from the Divine Oracle, in ſo plain a Caſe. They had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed on God's Prerogative, in dooming a whole Tribe to utter Exciſion; and bound themſelves under an heavy Curſe, to become the Executioners of his Vengeance, without conſulting his Will and Pleaſure: What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for them now to do, but to bewail their own Preſumption, and beg of him to releaſe them from their Oath, and permit them to raiſe up again that Tribe, which they had ſo inconſiderately doomed to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>
               <p>Had they taken this laudable Method, I doubt not but God would have either ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved them from their Oath, or directed them to ſome means how to ſupply the remaining 600 <hi>Benjamites</hi> with Wives, without the Breach of it; whether by diſpenſing with the Obligation of marrying <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; or permitting them to ſeize on them by Force, and without their Parents Conſent; or, laſtly, by naturalizing ſuch a Number of their Virgin Slaves, as would have ſufficed

for their Purpoſe; any of which the High-Prieſt in being could have authorized, in ſuch an Emergency, without any Infringement of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law; as he was ſupreme Judge in all ſuch doubtful Caſes, eſpecially when inveſted with the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>

Men, Women, and Children, in order to ſave all the Virgins they found amongſt them, and beſtow them upon the remaining 600 <hi>Benjamites.</hi> But the Number of them proving inſufficient, they have recourſe to another Stratagem, equally eluſory and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous; <hi>viz.</hi> permitting the other 200, that were ſtill unprovided for, to fall foul on a Company of Damſels, coming down from <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the then Place of <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Worſhip, and forcing them into Matrimony, without either their own, or their Parents, Conſent.

For it plainly intimates, that this Epoch, ſhort as it proved, was a time of Anarchy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; wherein the People, for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Governors to reſtrain them, had run themſelves into all kind of Licentiouſneſs. The idolatrous Worſhip ſet up by the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> in their new Settlement; the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attempt made by the <hi>Gibeathites,</hi> on the travelling <hi>Levite;</hi> the unnatural Abuſe of his Concubine; and the tumultuous War, with all its dire Effects that enſued; are brought in as pregnant Inſtances of the then reigning Corruption; and, being ſo little to the Credit of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation, are no leſs manifeſt Proofs of the Sincerity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality of the inſpired Hiſtorian. It is therefore in vain that your Antagoniſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to offer ſome more rational Expedients, by which the ſpilling of ſo much Blood might have been prevented, inſtead of thoſe violent ones, into which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to be hurried. Any Man of common Senſe might do the ſame; and yet ſo unhappy is he in his Choice of them, that
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0177700400:304"/>
the moſt conſiderable one of all he propoſes; <hi>viz.</hi> that for the ſaving the <hi>Gileadites</hi> from Deſtruction; can by no means be allowed of, as being altogether inconſiſtent with the Laws and martial Diſcipline of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> He tells you very gravely, that theſe, inſtead of dooming the Inhabitants of <hi>Gilead</hi> to utter Exciſion, ought only to have obliged them to give all their unmarried Females in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the 600 <hi>Benjamites;</hi> which they might the more lawfully have done, becauſe, as they did not appear in Arms at the Place of Rendezvous, they could not be affected by the general Oath which the reſt of the Tribes had ſworn. But here he ſhould have conſidered, that by their not anſwering the general Summons, they had, according to the martial Laws of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> forfeited their Lives, and incurred the Penalty of military Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which no Power could then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them; there being, at this Juncture, neither King nor Judge among them. And if he ſays, that the grand Council, or <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin,</hi> could have diſpenſed with the Severity of that Law; which, by-the-by, he will find an hard Matter to prove; yet it ought to be conſidered, how impolitic ſuch a Step muſt
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0177700400:305"/>
have been, and what an Encouragement it might have given to the reſt, to neglect the excellent Diſcipline which <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> had left amongſt them, and on which, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, as I ſhall ſhew in my next, how they were ſurrounded every-where with Enemies, beſides thoſe which they were forced ſtill to entertain within their own Bowels, was the greateſt Security they could have againſt any Attempt, either from within, or from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note n="x" place="bottom">

               <p>I have, by this time, gone thro' every thing worth Notice in your Opponent's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except the ſmall Sting which he leaves at the Cloſe of it; but which neither carries Sharpneſs or Poiſon enough to fright one from handling it. He thinks it very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, on the one hand, that <hi>Phinehas,</hi> who, as High-Pontiff, ſat at the Helm of, and ſteered, the whole <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> ſhould yet be ſo far wanting, either in Zeal, Courage, or Conduct, as not to make uſe of all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Authority with them, to ſuppreſs
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0177700400:306"/>
all thoſe ſhameful Diſorders that then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and on the other, that if ſuch was his Remiſſneſs, or Want of Authority, upon ſuch an Occaſion, one would reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expect, that God ſhould, as he has often done before and ſince, have interpoſed his Divine Power, either to inflame his Zeal, or give a due Weight to his Authority, both over the grand Council, and over the reſt of the People.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the firſt, I ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that <hi>Phinehas</hi> wanted neither Zeal nor Courage in God's Cauſe: Had his Authority been equal to either, there could never ſuch a general Apoſtaſy and Corruption have crept into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Commonwealth. A Perſon who had even dared to ſtop a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Defection of the whole Nation by the Death of the two chief Offenders, and thoſe of the higheſt Rank<note n="y" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See Num.</hi> xxv. 6.</note>, cannot be juſtly ſuppoſed to have connived at this general Apoſtaſy, for want of Zeal or Courage, had he been ſupported, as he ought, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power. But the whole Tenor of the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0177700400:307"/>
Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> and the frequent Apoſtaſies that crept in again and again, after the Death of any of thoſe Chiefs, whom God ſet up for Rulers and Deliverers of that rebellious Nation, is but too plain an Evidence of the little Influence which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pontiffs, and the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> had over them, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there happened an Interregnum, or the Want of a ſtrenuous Judge, to give it a due Sanction.</p>
               <p>But here, ſays your Opponent, the more viſible Need was there of the Divine Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to give that Sanction to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded Authority, in order to check that general Depravity. Before I anſwer this laſt Objection, give me Leave to obſerve to you, and I would adviſe you to do the ſame to him, how widely and inconſiſtently Men in this Way of Thinking are apt to argue, as beſt ſerves their Turn. At one time, you ſhall hear them exclaim againſt the Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of God's interpoſing ſo wonderfully, and ſo frequently, in favour of ſuch a poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Nation; which, moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were apt to repay his ſignal Favours with black Ingratitude, Murmurs, and downright
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0177700400:308"/>
Apoſtaſy: At other times, as in the Caſe before us, they will not ſcruple to aſcribe all thoſe Diſorders and Corruptions to the Want of this extraordinary Interpoſition. Sometimes theſe Divine Interpoſitions are arraigned, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as beneath the Dignity of the Supreme Being, or as an Infringement on the Liberty of rational Agents: And at other times, the Want of them is urged as an Argument againſt his Providence. So that, unleſs he will pleaſe to rain or ſhine, to act or not act, as they think proper, they will, at all Hazards, take the Liberty of cenſuring, or calling in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what the ſacred Books relate of him. How vaſtly ſhort was the great Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> of theſe fine Reaſoners, in Sagacity and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, who could freely own, that <hi>he had ſpent the latter Part of his Life in the Study of them, and could never be weary of admiring the great Views of thoſe Divine Oracles, and the juſt Relation of each Part; in which every Diſcovery he made, was a new Subject of the deepeſt Admiration</hi>

               <p>THE Occaſion of this dreadful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Summons of the newly choſen <hi>Hebrew</hi> Monarch, to the ten Tribes on this Side <hi>Jordan,</hi> you will find mentioned at the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0177700400:315"/>
Beginning of the Chapter; where <hi>Nahaſh,</hi> King of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> a moſt inveterate Enemy to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is related to have reduced the Inhabitants of <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead,</hi> on the other Side of that River, to ſuch Streights, that they were upon the Point of buying their Lives at the Expence of a moſt unworthy Slavery; and to ſubmit to the cruelleſt and moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Conditions, of being deprived of their right Eyes, as an eternal Brand of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy to their whole Nation, and an effectual means of rendering them utterly uſeleſs in War, and incapable of regaining their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Pretence for this unjuſt and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Behaviour of the <hi>Ammonitiſh</hi> King, you may read in the tenth and following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> where you will find the Caſe between the two Nations fairly ſtated, and the Ground of the Quarrel as fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exploded, by the then valiant <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chief, <hi>Jephthah</hi> the <hi>Gileadite.</hi> But as his Reaſons could not prevail upon them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, till he had forced them, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Victory he ſoon after gained over them; their Defeat had ſo excited their Rage ever ſince, that they thought now no Revenge bloody enough for their Reſentment. And
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0177700400:316"/>
this it was that made their haughty Monarch to refuſe the <hi>Jabeſhites</hi> any other, than thoſe cruel and ignominious Terms you have heard. So that the moſt that their Submiſſion and Diſtreſs could obtain from him, was a poor Truce, or rather Reprieve, of ſeven Days; in which Space of Time if no Relief could be procured from the other ten Tribes, they agreed to ſubmit to their hard Fate. And it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Wonder, that he, who breathed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Diſgrace and Ruin againſt the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> ſhould yet yield to them this ſhort Reſpite, and run the Riſk of a Delay. But here the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtorian tells us <hi>(Antiq.</hi> l. vi. c. 5.), that the Beſieged had already ſent to implore the Aſſiſtance of the two Tribes and an half on their Side of <hi>Jordan;</hi> and that none of them dared to ſtir an Hand to their Relief. So that there being ſo little Likelihood, that the other ten on this Side, which were ſtill at a greater Diſtance, ſhould be able to bring them any in ſo ſhort a time; he might, in that Confidence, eaſily grant them that Breathing-time; unleſs we will rather ſuppoſe, as moſt likely, that the Divine Providence ſo far reſtrained his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, in order to give the new <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0177700400:317"/>
Monarch an Opportunity of ſignalizing this Expedition, which was, in ſome meaſure, the firſt Eſſay of his Government, with ſuch an eminent Proof of his Fortitude and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and to reward his Generoſity with ſuch ſuitable Succeſs, as ſhould inſpire his new Subjects with a greater Regard to, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in, him.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the ſacred Hiſtorian tells us, that <hi>Saul,</hi> upon his Return from the Field, and receiving the firſt News of the <hi>Jabeſhites</hi> extreme Diſtreſs, was inſpired with a more than human Courage; whilſt the reſt of the People could only expreſs their Concern, by their doleful Outcries: And that having, in a kind of enthuſiaſtic Fury, hewed a Yoke of Oxen into ſmall Pieces, he diſpatched them with all Speed, by proper Meſſengers, to all the Tribes, with the dreadful Threat mentioned in the Text, <hi>Whoſoever cometh not forth after</hi> Saul <hi>and after</hi> Samuel, <hi>ſo ſhall it be done unto his Oxen,</hi> &amp;c. The Conſequence of which was, that the ten Tribes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately gathered themſelves with one Conſent, or, as the Original elegantly expreſſes it, <hi>as one Man;</hi> and obeyed his Summons, with
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0177700400:318"/>
ſuch ſurpriſing Readineſs and Speed, as to be able to join him, at the Time and Place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him for the general Rendezvous, tho' ſome of the Tribes were ſeated at above an hundred Miles Diſtance from it, as will be ſhewn to you in due time.</p>
               <p>As I am called upon, by my Duty and Office, to ſpeak to you from this Place, on this bleſſed Sabbath-day, you will have the leſs Cauſe to wonder at my chooſing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you, on this Occaſion, with this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and truly generous Expedition, of the new <hi>Hebrew</hi> Monarch; and to remind you of the ſingular Bleſſing that attended it; if you will but ſeriouſly reflect, that you are now called upon, and commanded, by your King and Country, to an Enterprize no leſs glorious and preſſing, the reſcuing of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City of this Realm from falling into the Hands of a no leſs inveterate Enemy; and ſome Thouſands of your brave Fellow-Subjects from the fatal and unavoidable Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſacrificing their Lives, to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to the loweſt State of Slavery: And whoſe Diſtreſs, and imminent Danger, though not perhaps quite ſo urgent as that of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0177700400:319"/>
the <hi>Jabeſhites</hi> in the Text, yet calls as loudly for all your wonted Valour, and quickeſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch, for their Relief. The next thing I would have you conſider is, how little Hopes the late Murmuring and Diſcontent (not to call it by a worſe Name, which you have expreſſed during a two or three Days long and difficult March, made perhaps ſomewhat more tireſome by the Badneſs of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther), afford us of your meeting with the ſame Succeſs as thoſe brave <hi>Hebrews</hi> did, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you be brought to a better Senſe of your Duty, before you come to engage our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy. And let me add, thirdly and laſtly, that ſhould this prove the happy Caſe, and God ſhould ſo far proſper what I am now going to deliver to you, as to inſpire and bleſs you with an equal Courage and Readineſs, which thoſe generous <hi>Hebrews</hi> diſplayed on the like Occaſion, I muſt not forbear remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, that you will, even then, have the leſs Reaſon to become arrogant and aſſuming upon it; a thing but too common in the like Caſes, ſeeing, ſhould your returning Loyalty and Valour atchieve what their ſteady and unſhaken one formerly did, the effectual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the City, and the total Over-throw
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0177700400:320"/>
of the Enemy, yet your Laurels would come ſtill vaſtly ſhort of theirs, and be no leſs tarniſhed by the mutinous Reluctance you have hitherto ſhewn on this Occaſion, than theirs muſt have been imbrightened by the ſurpriſing Chearfulneſs and Diſpatch, which they diſplayed in that; ſince it plainly appears, that this Exploit, great and arduous as it was, did not, from firſt to laſt, that is, from their receiving <hi>Saul</hi>'s firſt Summons to the War, to their putting an effectual End to it by the total Overthrow of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> take them up above five, or, at the moſt, ſix Days.</p>
               <p>But here it may be perhaps objected, that this laſt and mortifying Caution I have been giving you, might have more properly been deferred, till your ſingular Valour and Succeſs againſt the Enemy had called for it, than inſiſted upon at this time, when you have ſtill a two Days long and difficult March to come at them; and the greateſt Part of you ſeem to have ſo little Stomach to either. It will perhaps be thought, that, inſtead of damping your Zeal and Valour, by this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying Caution, I ought rather to try to rouſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0177700400:321"/>
it up, by ſuch enlivening Examples, as are to be met with in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Greek, Roman,</hi> and other antient Nations. And I might, indeed, here entertain you with a long Detail of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s arduous and hazardous March through <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> over the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> and forcing his Way thro' Mountains of Ice, and impenetrable Rocks, to come and attack the Enemies of his dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in the very Heart of theirs. I might remind you likewiſe of thoſe ſurpriſing and almoſt incredible Journeys, ſhall I call them, or not rather Flights? which <hi>Caeſar</hi> is recorded to have taken from <hi>Rome,</hi> either to the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> or the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to quaſh ſome dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt in the Birth; and in which he himſelf tells us, that he had already reached the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, before the News of his Departure was known in that Capital. I might alſo, and with no leſs Pleaſure, expatiate on that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and unparalleled Retreat, which the celebrated <hi>Xenophon</hi> made at the Head of his 10,000 <hi>Greeks,</hi> by a March of above 23,000 Miles, through ſtrange and impaſſable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, haraſſed and purſued all the Way, as they were, by their implacable Enemies, from <hi>Babylon</hi> quite to the <hi>Euxine Sea.</hi> Theſe
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0177700400:322"/>
and many other the like Inſtances of Valour and Indefatigableneſs, could I produce out of profane Hiſtory; ſufficient, one would think, the leaſt of them, to rouſe the moſt daſtardly and deſponding amongſt you to Courage and Activity, on ſuch a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juncture as this. But what Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can I expect ſuch an elaborate Diſplay of Oratory would make on ſuch a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Audience as I am ſpeaking to, but that of an obſtinate Unbelief? Would not moſt of you be ready to think, or even to ſay, that <hi>Caeſar, Xenophon,</hi> and other pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrical Retailers of their own heroic Deeds, do too plainly appear to have had a greater Regard to their own Glory than to Truth, to deſerve to be credited in every thing they have ſaid? Would not you likewiſe be apt to allege, in Excuſe for your Want of Zeal or Courage, that the unbounded Ambition, Thirſt after Glory, Revenge, and other the like Motives, which hurried an <hi>Hannibal,</hi> or a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> on ſuch arduous and deſperate At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, are of too baſe a Nature, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for Imitation to a Chriſtian Army, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on ſuch a Juncture as this, and after your late mutinous Behaviour hath ſo plainly
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0177700400:323"/>
convinced me, how hardly you are like to be wrought upon by thoſe of a more noble Nature, the Love and Defence of your Country, and the Preſervation of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Liberties?</p>
               <p>Well then, ſo far I hope I ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, for not attempting to reduce you to your Duty from ſuch precarious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable Examples; and for confining my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch only, as are to be found in the ſacred Books, and of whoſe Authority you can have no Pretence for any ſuch Doubts or Objections: For this Reaſon I have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſingled out this Inſtance, of <hi>Saul</hi>'s quick and effectual Relief of the diſtreſſed <hi>Jabeſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> not only as it bears a viſible Analogy to the noble Enterprize, to which you are commanded by your King and Country, and againſt which you have ſhewed ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous and diſloyal Reluctancy, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in hopes that the great and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable Difficulties, which the new <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Monarch, and his Army, were forced to overcome, in order to effect it in the ſhort Space that was allotted to them, and the Bleſſing that attended their zealous Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0177700400:324"/>
and ſurpriſing Diſpatch, will at once quell all your Murmurings and Diſcontents; and, by God's Aſſiſtance, inſpire you again with the like generous Ardour for your diſtreſſed Fellow-Subjects, and ſuch as may intitle you, in ſome meaſure, to the ſame Glory and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with them: For if you duly compare with me the Nature of the Exploit I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſet before your Eyes, the Difficulties that accompanied it, and the ſhort Space that <hi>Saul</hi> had to perform it, with the wonderful Succeſs that attended it; if you conſider that he had but five, or, at moſt, ſix Days, to raiſe a ſufficient Force againſt a powerful, inveterate, and ſucceſsful Enemy, out of the ten Tribes on this Side <hi>Jordan,</hi> and to reach the Beſieged on the other; and that he not only appeared there, at the Head of 330,000 armed Men before the Expiration of the time, but that he forecaſt his Matters with ſuch uncommon Prudence, as to ſurpriſe them on the very Morning in which they expected the City, with all its Inhabitants, to have been delivered up into their Hands; and, by falling upon them on every Side, to give them ſuch a total Overthrow, as put at once an End to that threatening War; I ſay, if
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0177700400:325"/>
you duly weigh all theſe Circumſtances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you muſt be forced to own it to be one of the moſt conſiderable Actions that can be met with in any Hiſtorian, either ſacred or profane; eſpecially if you add to it, that the whole Deſign was conducted by a young Monarch, who had hardly reigned three Months when he went upon this Enterprize; had been till then converſant only in rural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and was ſtill wholly unaccuſtomed to martial Feats; and at a time when the <hi>Hebrews</hi> laboured under the moſt grievous and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Circumſtances, as you will hear by and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Only give me Leave to obſerve to you here, that this Tranſaction, great, important, and ſurpriſing, as it was, is nevertheleſs tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us here by the inſpired Penman, not in the pompous and ſwollen Language of profane Hiſtorians, but in the plaineſt and moſt unaffected Stile, and ſuch as any one would deem much below the Dignity of the Subject, did we not certainly know this to be an Excellency peculiar to the ſacred Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and which is not to be met with in any but their inſpired Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0177700400:326"/>
I doubt not but moſt of you have read this ſingular Price of ſacred Hiſtory over and over; and yet I much queſtion, whether any of you have looked upon it as any other than a plain Relation of ſome notable Fact, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted long ago; and in which you, at this Diſtance, are little or not at all concerned, beyond the bare Knowlege of it. And may it not be chiefly owing to the artleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable Simplicity, with which it is recorded by the ſacred Hiſtorian, that you have over-looked the moſt ſurpriſing and remarkable Circumſtances of it, which could not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have eſcaped you, had they been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with thoſe florid Strokes of Rhetoric, which Hiſtorians commonly deal in, when they want to raiſe our Attention or Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But if that be the Caſe, it is no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I muſt plainly tell you, that you read the Scriptures to ſo little Purpoſe; and I hope I ſhall do you no inconſiderable Service, if what I have to ſay on this Subject proves an Inducement to you, to make you admire them the more, and to peruſe them with greater Reverence, as well as Profit, for their being thus diveſted from all artful Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0177700400:327"/>
but that of Conciſeneſs, and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Stile. For tho' this peculiar Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of theirs hath often expoſed them to the Cavils and Ridicule of ſome bold Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, and daring Infidels; yet it hath never failed, upon the ſtricteſt Search, and moſt impartial Scrutiny, of making their Authority appear the more venerable, and worthy of our deepeſt Regard. A lively Inſtance of which I ſhall now give you, in the ſurpriſing Exploit mentioned in my Text: For the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſplay of which I propoſe,</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place, To lay before you all the Difficulties that attended it, and have been, or may be, objected againſt the Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Fact.</p>
               <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> To ſhew you how thoſe Difficulties, great and infurmountable as they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by ſome late Critics, may have been overcome with Eaſe by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Monarch, by means of the excellent Laws, and martial Diſcipline, then known among the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and by the ſtrict and prudent Uſe he made of them, upon that Emergency, in order to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0177700400:328"/>
cauſe his Summons to be obeyed with a ſuitable Readineſs and Diſpatch.</p>
               <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> And, by way of Application, I ſhall not ſcruple to remind you, in the ſtrongeſt Terms, not only of the Shame and Diſgrace, but the complicated Danger, to which your Diſobedience and Diſloyalty will expoſe you, ſhould you, in ſpite of the bright and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Example I am going to ſet before your Eyes, ſtill perſiſt in a ſhameleſs Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of your Duty to your King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, on ſo preſſing on Occaſion as this to which you are called,</p>
               <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> then, I am to lay before you the vaſt, unſurmountable Difficulties, that attended this Expedition of the new <hi>Hebrew</hi> Monarch, in the timely Relief of his diſtreſſed Subjects. For theſe, upon Examination, will be found to have been ſuch, in the Eyes of ſome other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe learned Critics, as exceeded all Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or even Poſſibility, with regard to their having been ever ſurmounted in the manner, and in the ſhort Space of Time, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Hiſtorian aſſures us they were. So that ſome of them have made no Scruple to ſay,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0177700400:329"/>
the Relation would have been as much above their Belief, as it was above their Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had it not been tranſmitted to us by an inſpired Penman. Theſe Difficulties, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſhall, for Order's ſake, reduce under the three following Heads: 1. The diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous and diſtracted State which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Commonwealth was in, at the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this <hi>Ammonitiſh</hi> War. 2. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelihood there is that the <hi>Ammonitiſh</hi> King ſhould grant the befieged <hi>Jabeſhites</hi> even that poor Reſpite of ſeven Days; or, if he did, that he ſhould be ſo remiſs in that martial Diſcipline, for which his Nation was no leſs famed than the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as to have no kind of Intelligence of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his Army, being in full March againſt him; but ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſurpriſed, ſurrounded, and cut in Pieces, by three diſtinct Bodies, conſiſting in all of 330,000 Men. And, 3. The Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or rather Impoſſibility, of <hi>Saul</hi>'s raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo vaſt an Army, out of the ten Tribes on this Side <hi>Jordan,</hi> and conducting them to the Enemy's Camp, in ſo ſhort a Space as five or ſix Days, which is the utmoſt Length of time he had to do it in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0177700400:330"/>
1<hi>ſt,</hi> As to the diſadvantageous and diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed State the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were in, at the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this unexpected War, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to you, that though the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had ſignally diſplayed itſelf in their Favour, ſince the late dreadful Overthrow of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> by the grievous Plagues he ſent, ſucceſſively, to each of their five Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, during the ſeven Months in which the ſacred Ark remained amongſt them<note n="a" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> iv. v. <hi>&amp; ſeq. paſſ.</hi>
                  </note>; and more particularly afterwards, when <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Prayer obtained for them that ſignal and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Victory over the ſame Enemy, which enabled them to recover all the Fortreſſes which they had taken from them<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid, cap.</hi> vii. <hi>paſſ.</hi>
                  </note>; yet they were no ſooner threatened with this new War, than they aſſembled themſelves before that Prophet, and, in an obſtinate and tumultuous manner, inſiſted upon being thenceforth governed by a King, like other Nations; by which they not only introduced a new kind of Government, till then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known among them, which could not be done without creating ſome Diſorder and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0177700400:331"/>
Confuſion, altogether incompatible with their preſent diſtreſſed State; but, at the ſame time, caſt from them that divine Aſſiſtance, which had ſo manifeſtly diſplay'd itſelf in their Favour, and of which they never ſtood in greater need, than at this Juncture<note n="b" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> viii. 5, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>. And tho' God did indeed vouchſafe to yield to their unreaſonable Requeſt, yet it was in ſuch a manner, as gave them little Hopes of bettering their Condition by their Change; and accordingly <hi>Samuel</hi> failed not to expoſe their Folly and Ingratitude, as well as God's Reſentment, in the ſtrongeſt Terms, for thus caſting off the Divine Government and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, to put themſelves under that of a weak Mortal. So that when the Prophet came to acquaint them with the News of <hi>Saul</hi>'s being appointed King over them, they conceived ſuch ſmall Hopes of him, that they began to think themſelves in a worſe Caſe than they were before, and him to be ſet over them, rather for a Puniſhment, than a Defender. He was indeed taller than the reſt, by the Head and Shoulder<note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> ix. 2.</note>; but, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his Courage and Conduct were equal
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0177700400:332"/>
to his Stature, it only expoſed him the more to the Shots of the Enemy. And what Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood was there, that they ſhould entertain any ſuch Hopes of a young Man, whoſe Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, till then, had never reached higher than the Plough and Cart; and whoſe ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Behaviour, in hiding himſelf among his Father's Lumber, to avoid being introduced to the People<note n="d" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> x. 22.</note>, ſhewed nothing leſs than a Soul fit to take the Reins of Government over ſuch a ſtubborn Nation, and at ſuch a critical Juncture? To which if we add, that <hi>Kiſh</hi> his Father, who muſt be beſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, could find no better Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him, than to ſend him in queſt of ſome ſtraggling Aſſes<note n="e" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> ix. 3.</note>; and that he did not exempt him from following his rural Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even after he had been declared King by <hi>Samuel,</hi> at the Head of all the Tribes<note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> xi. 5.</note>; we ſhall ſee little Reaſon to ſuppoſe, that they could expect any greater Feats from him, either on this, or any other, Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, than thoſe Malecontents did, who, in a ſcoffing manner, cried out, <hi>How ſhall</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0177700400:333"/>
                  <hi>this Man ſave us?</hi> and refuſed to pay him the Compliments and Preſents uſual on the like Occaſions<note n="g" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> x. 27.</note>.</p>
               <p>If we now look upon the Condition the People were in, at the breaking out of this War, we ſhall find it to the full as melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and unpromiſing, as that of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed new Monarch. <hi>Joſephus</hi> informs us<note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> vi. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>ad fin.</hi>
                  </note>, that the diſtreſſed <hi>Jabeſhites</hi> had ſent in vain to implore the Aſſiſtance of the two Tribes and half on the other Side <hi>Jordan;</hi> and that not a Soul dared ſtir Hand or Foot to their Relief. And the Text tells us, that when their Meſſengers reached the City of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> the Place of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Reſidence, and acquaiuted the Inhabitants with their extreme Diſtreſs, they could only have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to their Cries<note n="i" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xi. 4.</note>; which plainly ſhews, that their Hearts were readier to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail, than to aſſiſt, thoſe poor Sufferers; who, on their Part, were ſo far ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Deſpondency, that, inſtead of reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to die Sword in Hand, in Defence of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0177700400:334"/>
their Liberty, they had already engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſubmit to a baſe and ignominious Slavery, if they could not obtain ſome time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aſſiſtance from their Brethren on this Side<note n="k" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xi. 3.</note>. How improbable is it therefore, how abſurd, to ſuppoſe that the whole <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Nation, deſponding and unprepared as they were for ſuch an Exploit, ſhould agree, <hi>as one Man,</hi> ſo the Text expreſſes it<note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. ver.</hi> 7.</note>, to follow ſuch a Novice of a Monarch, to the Number of 330,000, on ſo difficult and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an Expedition, and againſt a warlike and inveterate Enemy, who had been, for many Years, premeditating this War, and making all the neceſſary Preparations for, as well as made already ſuch a confiderable Progreſs in it! Eſpecially if we add to all this, the great Diſtance of ſome of the ten Tribes to the Place of Rendezvous, and the apparent Unlikelihood, not to ſay Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of their reaching the Beſiegers Camp ſoon enough to ſave the City. And thus much may ſuffice for the firſt Kind of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which are objected againſt the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of this Piece of ſacred Hiſtory, from
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0177700400:335"/>
the diſadvantageous and diſtracted State of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Commonwealth, at this Jun cture.</p>
               <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> The next is drawn from the great Unlikelihood, that the <hi>Ammonitiſh</hi> King ſhould grant the reduced <hi>Jabeſhites</hi> even ſo poor a Reſpite as ſeven Days; or, allowing that he did ſo, that he ſhould be ſo remiſs in his martial Diſcipline, and be ſo void of all Intelligence of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his great Army, being in full March againſt him, as to ſuffer himſelf to be ſurpriſed, ſurrounded, and cut in Pieces, by three ſuch vaſt Bodies as his Army conſiſted of. For, with relation to the firſt, the antient Hatred between the two Nations of <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was ſtill more exaſperated by the total Over-throw which <hi>Jephthah,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Hero, gave them, about fifty Years before, makes it but too probable, that they undertook this War with a full Deſign of taking a ſevere Revenge on them for that ſignal Victory<note n="A" place="bottom">This cruel Conteſt of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> for the Land of <hi>Gilead,</hi> is elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed by the Prophet <hi>Amos (C. i. Ver.</hi> 13, <hi>&amp; ſeq.)</hi> by their ripping open the pregnant Women (or, as the Original likewiſe imports, and the Margin of our Bibles tranſlates it, their tearing open the Mountains) of <hi>Gilead:</hi> For which that Prophet denounces utter Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the <hi>Ammonitiſh</hi> King, and his whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note>. And the unmerciful Terms which
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0177700400:336"/>
                  <hi>Nahaſh</hi> their King impoſed on the <hi>Jabeſhites,</hi> make it very unlikely, that he ſhould be ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prevailed upon to ſuſpend his Reſentment ſo long as ſeven Days; much more that, having agreed to grant them that Reprieve, he ſhould not be more attentive to what was tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the other Side of the River, than to ſuffer himſelf to be thus ſhamefully ſurpriſed by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Monarch, at the Head of ſo numerous an Army. This is the ſecond Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that is objected againſt the Probability of this Expedition, as it is related by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtorian; and to which I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give likewiſe a ſufficient Anſwer in its proper Place. But,</p>
               <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> The third and laſt Objection is ſtill ſtronger; and is urged, not only againſt the Probability, but even againſt the Poſſibility, of the Fact; as it is circumſtantiated by the ſacred Penman. It is drawn from the Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0177700400:337"/>
of the Time allowed for completing ſo ſignal a Deliverance, compared with the Diſtance of the ſeveral Places to which <hi>Saul</hi>'s dreadful Summons were directed; the Space of Time required for ſuch a vaſt Army to be equipped, and ready for a March; and the Length of the Way they had to go, to reach the Place of Rendezvous, and thence to come at the Camp of the Beſiegers. To make this the more plainly to appear, it muſt be obſerved, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That the beſieged City of <hi>Jabeſh</hi> could ſtand at no leſs Diſtance from <hi>Gibeah,</hi> the Place of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Reſidence, than between ſixty and ſeventy of our Miles; but perhaps conſiderably more, if we add to it the Mountainouſneſs of the Country, the Windings and Turnings of the Roads, and the like: So that allowing the ſeven Days Time to have been granted to the Beſieged ever ſo early in the Morning, their Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers can hardly be ſuppoſed to have reached <hi>Gibeah,</hi> till the Evening of the next Day. <hi>Soul</hi> therefore could have but five more Days to ſummon the ten Tribes to Arms; ſome of which, eſpecially on the South Side, were above an hundred Miles from <hi>Gibeah,</hi> and above an hundred and ſixty from <hi>Bezek,</hi> the

Place appointed for the general Rendezvous<note n="B" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Gibeah,</hi> the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place and Reſidence of <hi>Saul,</hi> was ſituate pretty near the Centre, between the North and South Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> and between ſix and eight Miles North of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> according to <hi>Joſephus, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom.</hi> From <hi>Gibeah</hi> to <hi>Bethſhean,</hi> the Place where the Army was to croſs the <hi>Jordan,</hi> were about ſixty more; and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek,</hi> the Place of Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, was ſituate within two or three Miles from <hi>Bethſhean.</hi> The Authors above-mentioned take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of two Towns, of the Name of <hi>Bezek,</hi> but place them only within a Mile or two from each other: So that which of the two ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was that <hi>Saul</hi> pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, for the Meeting of his Army, their Diſtance from <hi>Bethſhean</hi> could not be above five or ſix Miles at moſt; and from this laſt to <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead,</hi> may be computed about ten or twelve more; for there is no coming at any Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to the true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thoſe Places; and it will be ſufficient, if we can, by the moſt equitable Computation we can make from the Authors above-quoted, and from <hi>Reland,</hi> and other Moderns, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode the pretended Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of <hi>Saul</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Exploit above-mentioned within the Time limited by the ſacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian.</note>; where, nevertheleſs, upon a Review of the whole Army, they were found to amount to 300,000 effective Men, beſides 30,000 more of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi>

requires now-a-days, to raiſe and fit up an Army of 30 or 40,000 Men among us, or even to equip a General, to appear at the Head of them, can ever imagine, that ſo raw and unexperienced a Monarch as <hi>Saul,</hi> ſhould ever have been able to raiſe one, of almoſt ten times that Number, out of ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tribes; much leſs to lead them, armed <hi>Cap-à-pé,</hi> againſt ſo powerful an Enemy; and with ſuch Speed and Secrecy, as to fall unexpectedly upon them, and give them ſuch a ſignal Overthrow, as put an effectual End to the threatening War, and to all future Hoſtilities from that Quarter, during his whole Reign? And to perform all this, in a ſmaller Number of Days, than a much leſs difficult and important Enterprize would have taken up Months amongſt us<note n="D" place="bottom">That is, within the ſhort Space of five, or, at moſt ſix Days, from the time that <hi>Saul</hi> received the News of the Siege of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſh;</hi> which, the Text tells us, was in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he was returning from his rural Affairs<note n="1" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xi. 5.</note>.

Thus far goes the Objection of our Hypercritics, againſt the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0177700400:342"/>
Poſſibility of the Fact; to which I doubt not, nevertheleſs, to give ſuch a full Anſwer, as will leave no room for doubting of the Feaſibleneſs of it, when duly weighed with the excellent Conſtitution, and martial Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation; a Circumſtance with which the Objectors ſeem not to have been fufficiently acquainted, or, at leaſt, not to have paid due Attention to. But I am, under this next general Head, to remove the two grand Difficulties that are raiſed againſt the Probability of the ſacred Narrative.</p>
               <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> then, In Anſwer to the firſt of theſe Difficulties, drawn from the diſadvantageous Situation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Commonwealth, at the breaking out of this <hi>Ammonitiſh</hi> War, both with reſpect to the apparent Inability of their new Monarch, and the Deſpondency of the People, on account of their late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from God; might not the ſevere Threats which <hi>Samuel</hi> pronounced againſt them, which we find extorted ſo humble and pathetic a Confeſſion from them of their
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0177700400:343"/>
Guilt and Ingratitude, prove a moſt effectual Spur to that uncommon Readineſs, with which they complied with <hi>Saul</hi>'s Commands? However, it will be ſufficient here to obſerve to you in general, that the whole Affair ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly to have been conducted by the Divine Providence, and with the ſame gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and conſtant View, of reducing that ungrateful and rebellious People to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, and ſteady Dependence on him; from both which they had ſo ſhamefully ſwerved, during the latter End of <hi>Eli</hi> their Judge and High-Prieſt's remiſs Government; and as a due Puniſhment for which, he had ſuffered them to be thus depreſſed at this time<note n="n" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii. 27, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> iii, II, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> iv. <hi>paſſ.</hi>
                  </note>. The Book of <hi>Judges</hi> furniſhes us with many ſignal Inſtances of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein God was pleaſed to ſuffer them to ſink into the loweſt State of Slavery and Deſpondency, for their frequent Defections and Idolatries; and afterwards to raiſe them to their priſtine Freedom, and proſperous State, by ſuch unlikely and diſparate means, as might beſt direct their Eyes and Hearts to him. This we find was the Caſe, when he delivered them from their ſeveral Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0177700400:344"/>
under the Conduct of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack,</hi> of <hi>Gideon, Jephthah,</hi> and others of their Chiefs<note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid. int. al. Jud.</hi> vii. 2, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>. And let me add here, that as the People never ſtood in greater Need of ſuch a gracious <hi>Memento,</hi> than at this time, when, in the Height of all their Diſtreſs, they ſeem to have ſo far caſt off the Divine Protection, as to put their ſole Hope and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in having a King ſet over them, for their Deliverer; ſo nothing could be more proper to reduce them from their miſplaced Confidence, than the giving them ſuch an unpromiſing one as <hi>Saul</hi> was; and then, upon the very firſt Emergency, to inſpire him with ſuch unexpected Fortitude and Conduct; and to crown it with ſuch wonderful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoped for Succeſs. For this could hardly fail of inſpiring both King and People with a freſh and ſurer Truſt and Dependence on God, above any human Help. Accordingly, you may remember, that God had taken care to encourage the new Monarch with ſuch a kind of Promiſe, from the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, by the Mouth of his Prophet, in theſe Words; <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou ſhalt become</hi>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0177700400:345"/>
                  <hi>another Man; and let it be, when theſe things are come unto thee, that thou do as Occaſion ſhall require; for God is with thee</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> x. 6, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</note>. In conſequence of which Divine Aſſurance it was, no doubt, that <hi>Saul,</hi> on his returning from the Field, and hearing the Outcries of the People, on account of the <hi>Jabeſhites,</hi> felt ſuch an uncommon Warmth at their Diſtreſs, as well as Reſentment againſt the puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and deſponding <hi>Gibeathites,</hi> that he immediately ordered the two Bullocks to be hewn in Pieces, and ſent to each Tribe, with the dreadful Summons mentioned in my Text; <hi>Whoſoever cometh not forth after</hi> Saul <hi>and after</hi> Samuel, <hi>ſo ſhall it be done unto his Oxen.</hi> The Reſult of which was, that they were ſtruck with Fear and Dread, and made ſo quick a Diſpatch to join him at the Place of Rendezvous, that they were all got thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from every Tribe, with one Conſent, a Day at leaſt before the Expiration of the Truce, and to the Number of 330,000 ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective Men. How eaſily this might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, is what I ſhall ſhew under another Head: In the mean time I cannot but obſerve to you, from what hath been ſaid under this,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0177700400:346"/>
as well with reſpect to the generous and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic Spirit which <hi>Saul</hi> diſplay'd on this preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Occaſion, and the extraordinary Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which the People obeyed his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as with reſpect to the wonderful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with which both were crowned, that the Whole plainly appears to have been the Work of the Divine Providence. For as to the firſt, the Text expreſly affirms, that <hi>the Spirit of God came upon</hi> Saul; and it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſuppoſed, that any thing but ſuch an extraordinary Impulſe, could have frighted his heartleſs and deſponding Subjects into ſo ready, quick, and univerſal, Compliance with his Commands; eſpecially as the Danger that threatened them was ſo far off, <hi>Jabeſh</hi> being on the other Side <hi>Jordan,</hi> and at a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the greateſt Part of the Tribes; and the Loſs of it not appearing to them of ſuch Conſequence, as to require ſo quick a Diſpatch, had there been a much greater Probability of their ſucceeding in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to relieve it. So that, upon the Whole, it cannot be doubted, that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, by this ſingular Diſplay of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to ſignalize the firſt warlike Eſſay of his new Anointed, in ſuch a manner, as
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0177700400:347"/>
ſhould inſpire his People with a due Regard to him, and both him and them with a more ſure and ſtedfaſt Reliance on the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, as well as a warmer Zeal for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than they had hitherto ſhewn for it; more eſpecially ſince that ſhameful and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Degeneracy, which the Wickedneſs of <hi>Eli</hi>'s and <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Sons had cauſed among them. In all this there is nothing but what is exactly uniform and agreeable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which the Divine Providence had ſhewn already, upon ſeveral Occaſions of the like Nature; and more particularly in the Caſes of <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Gideon, Jephthah,</hi> and other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chiefs; and what he continued ſtill to ſhew, ſince then, in favour of many of their Monarchs. And this is, indeed, what the Prophet took care to inculcate into them, in the ſtrongeſt Terms, in that pathetic Speech which he made to them, ſoon after the ſignal Overthrow of <hi>Nahaſh,</hi> and his Hoſt; wherein he aſſures them, that provided they did caſt off all their vain and ſuperſtitious Confidence in their Idols, and falſe Deities, and truſt in God alone, and abide in his Truth, they ſhould never fail of his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

and Protection<note n="q" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xii. <hi>paſſ. &amp; ver.</hi> 20, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>

               <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> I come now to the ſecond, which is objected againſt the Probability of the Fact; <hi>viz.</hi> the Unlikelihood there is that <hi>Nahaſh,</hi> who breathed nothing but Ignominy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould yet be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to grant to the <hi>Jabeſhites</hi> even that ſhort Reprieve of ſeven Days; and much more, that, having once granted it, he ſhould keep ſo bad a Look-out, as to be wholly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what was tranſacting on the other Side <hi>Jordan,</hi> and ſuffer his Camp to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and ſurrounded by <hi>Saul,</hi> and his Army, on the very Morning on which he expected the City to be delivered up to him: But as ſurpriſing and uncommon ſoever as that Over-ſight may appear, we meet with Inſtances enough of it, in ſacred and profane Hiſtory, and even among modern and warlike Nations, to confute the pretended Improbability of it.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0177700400:349" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I ſhall here only remind you of that ſignal Infatuation of the <hi>French</hi> General, Count <hi>Tallard,</hi> who, when he might eaſily have oppoſed the confederate Army, under the late glorious Duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> from paſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to come at him, did yet ſuffer them to croſs that rapid River unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted; alleging, that the more ſhould come over to them, the more would be either killed or taken; the Conſequence of which egregious Overſight, you may well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was the total Defeat of the <hi>French</hi> Army at <hi>Hockſtedt,</hi> the Taking of their inſolent General Priſoner, with a prodigious Number of other commanding Officers of Diſtinction, and the Saving of the Empire from the moſt impending Danger.</p>
               <p>But were this preſumptuous Negligence of the <hi>Ammonitiſh</hi> King even without any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, yet, when duly weighed with all its Circumſtances, it will appear far enough from having any thing that can exceed your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, in few Words, that <hi>Nahaſh</hi> had ſo mean an Opinion of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> at this Juncture, that he made no Difficulty to comply with the Beſiegers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0177700400:350"/>
And if we look upon the deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Figure which, as I obſerved to you, the <hi>Jews</hi> made, at this time, under their new Government and Monarch, we ſhall find nothing among them, but what might contribute to lull that inveterate Enemy into the fatal Security, in which they ſo happily ſurpriſed him. Had even <hi>Saul</hi> ever ſhewn himſelf a Man of a more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Diſpoſition, yet what Likelihood was there, that he ſhould raiſe ſo powerful an Army, in ſo ſhort a time; or be in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to attack the Enemy in their Camp, before the Expiration of ſo ſhort a Truce? Where is then the Wonder, that <hi>Nahaſh</hi> ſhould conſent to ſuſpend his Cruelty for ſo little a while, when he had no other Proſpect before him, than that of execute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with greater Satisfaction, at the End of it? Whereas might he not have ſome Cauſe to fear, leſt an abſolute Refuſal of their Requeſt ſhould force the Beſieged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome deſperate Attempt, to ſave their Lives and Liberty; which might coſt him the Loſs of a good Number of his Troops, or, at leaſt, prove of much worſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0177700400:351"/>
to him, than a ſeven Days Reſpite could, all things conſidered, be poſſibly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do. It is hardly credible, indeed, that the <hi>Ammonites</hi> ſhould be wholly unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed of the Motions of the ten Tribes on this Side the River; but that they ſhould be intended for the Relief of the Beſieged, much leſs that there ſhould be any Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their reaching the Place time enough to effect it, is what never could come into their Heads; and the moſt they could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from them was, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to oppoſe their farther Progreſs. It is alſo no leſs unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that ſo warlike and well-diſciplined a Nation ſhould be without their Piquet, their Vanguard, Scouts, Spies, and other martial Precautions, at that Juncture; and all theſe they may have had, and yet ſeveral unforeſeen Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents may have concurred, thro' the Policy of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Monarch, to render them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, if not, perhaps, contribute to their Indolence, and fatal Security. <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſome of the Tribes, might take the Advantage of their Nearneſs to the Place of Rendezvous, to ſecure all the Paſſes and Defiles leading from <hi>Jordan</hi> to the Enemy's Camp, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0177700400:352"/>
thereby intercept all kind of Intelligence of his Approach from reaching them; which would, of courſe, make them think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the more ſecure, upon that very Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: They might, in all Likelihood, be ſtill more confirmed in it, by thoſe very Meſſengers whom <hi>Saul</hi> ſent to acquaint the Beſieged on the Night before his Arrival, with his Deſign of attacking the Enemy by the next Morning: For, whilſt they were carrying the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and encouraging News to the Beſieged, they might take that Opportunity to ſpread a contrary Report thro' the Beſiegers Camp; and make them believe, that neither <hi>Saul,</hi> nor any of his Tribes on the other Side, had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Power or Courage to come to their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. But that which, in all Appearance, contributed moſt to lull them aſleep, was the ſubtle Meſſage which the <hi>Jabeſhites</hi> ſent to the <hi>Ammonitiſh</hi> King; That, having in vain implored the Help of their Brethren on the other Side <hi>Jordan,</hi> they had now no other Reſource left, than to march out by the next Morning, and caſt themſelves at his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: For this News, being once ſpread through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Camp, could hardly fail of rendering both Guards and Centinels more remiſs and negligent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0177700400:353"/>
There was ſtill a further Stratagem, not unuſual in thoſe early Days, which <hi>Saul</hi> might uſe with Succeſs, in order to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them unawares; <hi>viz.</hi> fetching a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs about, inſtead of taking the neareſt Way to them, which he might the more eaſily do, as he marched his Army in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Columns<note n="E" place="bottom">This was a Method very uſual, as well as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in theſe mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Countries, where the frequent Deſiles, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Paſſes, muſt otherwiſe have obſtructed the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the March of a whole Army; conſidering how numerous they were wont to be, in thoſe Days. And as for that of dividing them into two, three, or more Bodies, as Occaſion required, in order to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe an Enemy, we find it was practiſed even ſo early as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, and with good Succeſs; tho' his whole Force, we are told, conſiſted only of 318 of his own Servants, and, in all Likelihood, about much the ſame Number of thoſe of his two Confederates<note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Conf. Geneſ.</hi> xiv. 13, <hi>&amp; ſeq. &amp; verſ.</hi> 24.</note>.</note>; and moſt probably under the Guidance of ſome of thoſe <hi>Jabeſhites,</hi> who had been deputed to appriſe him with their Diſtreſs, and who muſt be ſuppoſed to have been beſt acquainted with all the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to it, as well as with the Situation of the Enemy's Camp. So that by continuing their March all that Night, and with as little
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0177700400:354"/>
Noiſe as poſſible, he might with Eaſe come upon them unperceived and unexpected; till their ſurrounding Shouts waked them, perhaps, out of their profound Sleep; and the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Day-light diſcovered them on every Side of their Camp, and ready to ruſh upon them with all their Might. In the Confuſion, which muſt be reaſonably ſuppoſed to have reigned thro' the whole Hoſt of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers, we may likewiſe expect, that the <hi>Jabeſhites</hi> would not fail to make good their Promiſe of coming out to them, and falling upon their Rear, whilſt their Front and Flanks were no leſs bravely plied by <hi>Saul</hi>'s three powerful Corps. No Wonder then, if, with all theſe Advantages, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> gained ſo ſignal and eaſy a Victory, and made ſuch a dreadful Slaughter among them; which, the Text tells us, laſted from Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, till the Heat of the Day obliged them to give it over<note n="s" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xi. 10, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0177700400:355"/>
which they injected ſuch a Panic among them, as ſeldom failed of ending in their total Defeat.

                  </note>. Thus far then, I hope, I have fully removed the two firſt Difficulties, which are objected againſt the Probability of this remarkable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit.</p>
               <p>I come now to the third and laſt, in which our Unbelievers ſeem to triumph over us, with a <hi>Credat Judoeus;</hi> and is levelled not only againſt the Probability, but againſt the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, of the Fact, as related and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated by the ſacred Hiſtorian; that is, as you have already heard, the Shortneſs of the Time in which it is affirmed to have been effected. For if we allow, that the <hi>Jabeſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> Meſſengers could not reach <hi>Saul</hi> till after the ſecond Evening of the Truce, it will of Neceſſity follow, that he had but five Days more to ſend his Summons to every Part of his Kingdom, on this Side <hi>Jordan,</hi> and to get his vaſt numerous Army punctually rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, upon the Spot, at the general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; which, conſidering the Length of the Way, and other obvious Difficulties, muſt needs make ſuch a March appear altogether
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0177700400:358"/>
impracticable. And ſo it muſt needs appear to thoſe, who only reflect on the Time that it would take up, to raiſe an Army of even the tenth Part of that Bulk among us, and to get it ready equipped, and fit for Action, as this was; and that an equal Number of Months would hardly ſuffice now-a-days, to fit out one of our Generals to appear at the Head of it. But the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were, in this reſpect, under much better Regulations, and a more excellent Diſcipline; and ſo they had need indeed, conſidering that they were not only ſurrounded, on all Sides, with ſuch war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and powerful Enemies, but likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed, within, with a great Number of others, equally inveterate, and ready to join Hands with the reſt, in every hoſtile Attempt againſt them<note n="F" place="bottom">The <hi>Ifraelites</hi> were encompaſſed on the North by the <hi>Syrians,</hi> on the Eaſt by the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> on the South by the <hi>Edomites</hi> and <hi>Amalekites;</hi> and on the Weſt moſt of their Coaſts were hemmed in by the <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> and the reſt lay expoſed to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion from the <hi>Tyrians, Sidonians, Egyptians,</hi> and other maritime Nations; all of them ill affected, and the far greater Part irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable Enemies, to them.

                     </note>; theſe, I ſay, were ſtill more dangerous Enemies than the reſt; and their Hiſtory but too plainly ſhews, how watchful they were of all Opportunities of retaliating upon them, and bringing them under the ſevereſt Subjection and Slavery<note n="2" place="bottom">

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0177700400:359"/>
that a Nation ſo ſituate, ſo hated, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by ſuch a Variety of warlike Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſhould take all proper Methods to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure itſelf, as much as poſſible, from being ſurpriſed or overpowered by them?</p>
               <p>But this is not all: They had, from their firſt coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> been inured to an excellent martial Diſcipline under <hi>Moſes;</hi> who, beſides his being thoroughly inſtructed in all the Wiſdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had acted all along under the Direction of the Divine Providence. So that nothing was more regular and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than their Method of encamping, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping, marching, and engaging; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the whole <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Hoſt conſiſted of no leſs 600,000 fighting Men; that is, Males between twenty and ſixty, beſides thoſe above and under that Age, Women, Servants, and an innumerable Mixture that followed
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0177700400:360"/>
their Camp<note n="x" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See Exodus</hi> xii. 37, 38.</note>: All of which, put together, could hardly amount to leſs than three Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Souls. A prodigious Hoſt indeed! to be led about, during forty whole Years, thro' ſuch a Wilderneſs, and under ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Difficulties and Diſcouragements, by a ſingle Perſon. All which could only be owing to that excellent Diſcipline which he had eſtabliſhed among them; and to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Interpoſition, and ſevere Puniſhments inflicted upon them, upon every murmuring or rebellious Attempt. Accordingly, as ſoon as they were directed, by the ſupernatural Cloud, for a new March, they had three Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals given through the whole Camp; the firſt, for taking up their Tents, and packing up their Baggage; the ſecond, for ſummoning each Tribe to appear under their reſpective Standards and Chiefs, accoutred and armed, or to repair to the ſeveral other Poſts aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; and the laſt, for moving in ſuch a Number of Columns, as they were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or as the Ground would permit. All which was performed with wonderful Order and Regularity; inſomuch that this vaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy Body hath, upon ſome Occaſions,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0177700400:361"/>
been able to march eighteen or twenty Miles in one Day, before the firy Pillar gave them the Signal to encamp. At which time they obſerved the ſame Order and Method for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitching their Tents; which, <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, was done with ſuch Exactneſs, that it reſembled a moſt regular City, compoſed of as many Quarters as there were Tribes, with ſpacious Streets, Lanes, and all other Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies; whilſt the ſacred Ark was placed under the ſtately Tabernacle, in the Centre of the Whole; ſurrounded by regular Rows of Tents, belonging to <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and the reſt of the Prieſts and Levites; and placed at a due Diſtance from the reſt of the Tribes.</p>
               <p>This excellent <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſcipline was, no Doubt, greatly improved afterwards, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted to the Exigencies of their preſent Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in <hi>Canaan,</hi> by their new General <hi>Joſhua,</hi> a Perſon no leſs experienced in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Affairs, and equally under the Divine Conduct with his Predeceſſor. Their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Situation, among ſuch vigilant and potent Enemies, challenged his utmoſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſo important a Point; and had he not been directed by the Divine Providence,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0177700400:362"/>
yet Neceſſity muſt have been the Mother of Invention, and put him upon finding out all poſſible Ways and Methods of defending himſelf, and People, againſt all Surprizes, as well as public Attacks, from any Side; and, upon all ſuch Emergencies, for conveying the Alarm through all the Tribes, at leaſt thoſe on this Side <hi>Jordan,</hi> in the moſt expeditious manner.</p>
               <p>Now it is certain, that no Country was better furniſhed with wide and commodious Roads, for the Expedition of Meſſengers and Travellers, than theirs; and this owing chiefly to the Injunctions given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and cloſely followed by his worthy Succeſſor <hi>Joſhua,</hi> to have all the Roads leading, not only to the ſix Cities of Refuge on each Side the <hi>Jordan,</hi> for the innocent Man-ſlayers to flee to<note n="y" place="bottom">

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0177700400:363"/>
other neceſſary Conveniencies, to render their Travelling as eaſy and expeditious as poſſible. All which, though chiefly contrived for the Benefit of thoſe who were obliged to flee to ſuch Places of Refuge, yet equally contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the quick Diſpatch of Couriers and Meſſengers, when ſent from one Part of the Kingdom to another, upon any important Buſineſs; for thoſe Cities and Sanctuaries, being ſcattered through the whole Country, and at proper Diſtances from each other, made it requiſite to have the greater Number of thoſe commodious Highways, in every Tribe; and theſe did not a little facilitate the Marches of their Armies from one Part of the Kingdom to the other, upon all Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies.</p>
               <p>They had another Convenience likewiſe, for the quick Diſpatch of their Intelligence; <hi>viz.</hi> by their Dromedaries; a Creature very common in all thoſe Eaſtern Parts, and ſo ſwift-footed, that they were chiefly uſed for Expedition by the Rich; and we are told, that they commonly travelled 100 Miles, and ſome of them 150 Miles, a Day<note n="a" place="bottom">

then might the <hi>Jabeſhite</hi> Meſſengers reach <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Gibeah</hi> on the firſt Evening of the Truce; and this will give him one Day more to atchieve their Deliverance, than the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors ſeem willing to allow. But all this will ſtill go but a little Way towards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for the prodigious Diſpatch he made in ſending his threatening Summons to all the ten Tribes, and they in joining him at the general Rendezvous; unleſs we can find out ſome ſtill more expeditious Method, from their martial Diſcipline, for conveying the Alarm throughout the Kingdom, and for the ſummoned Tribes repairing to their reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive Standards, armed and expedited for ſuch a March.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that the Alarm, or Summons for a general Armament, were conveyed thro' the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Beacons, or firy Signals, kindled upon the Tops of the Hills; which, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Mountainouſneſs of the Country, and the few Plains of any Length there were in it, might eaſily ſpread itſelf thro' every Part of it, in the Space of a few Hours. Theſe Beacons we find often mentioned
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0177700400:365"/>
in the Prophets, and were in uſe not only among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but among all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Nations that were ſeated in hilly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries<note n="G" place="bottom">Of theſe firy Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, or Beacons, we find frequent Mention in the Prophets<note n="1" place="bottom">

We may likewiſe reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuppoſe them to have been diſtinguiſhed by ſome proper Difference, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nature of the Notice they were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, and in order to direct the Alarm-trumpets in the lower Lands to ſpread it, by their proper and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sounds; of which they had a Variety, according to the various Exigencies for which they were blown. For, in ſome Caſes, only two or three Tribes were to be ſummoned to Arms, as in the Caſe of <hi>Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah,</hi> &amp;c.; and in others, as in that of all the Tribes againſt the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamites</hi>

                     </note>, and in that we are upon, the whole Nation was to appear in Arms. They ſeem like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, from the different Names uſed by the inſpired Writers, to have had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sort, probably for the Day-time, when the firy ones could not be ſo eaſily perceived; and theſe were Enſigns, differently diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on thoſe Eminences, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, in ſome Sort, to thoſe uſed at Sea; and ſerving to convey the Summons to the low Lands, with much the ſame Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note>; and, being eaſily perceived at a
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0177700400:366"/>
vaſt Diſtance from each other, eſpecially in the Night-time, and being moreover diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by ſome well known Difference, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Notice or Orders they were to convey, were immediately anſwered by the Sounds of the Trumpets in the Valleys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; ſo that not a City or Village, whether ſituate on high or low Ground, could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the general Alarm, or ignorant of the Deſign of it, either from the Nature of the Signal, or the different Sounding of the Trumpets, in a leſs Space than a Night. Whenever therefore the Import of the Alarm was for a general Armament, every Man that was able to bear Arms, being obliged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their martial Diſcipline, to repair with their proper Weapons and Accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to their reſpective Standards, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſevereſt Penalties; they had nothing to do but to haſten to their Arms, and to furniſh themſelves with two or three Days Proviſions for the Mouth; which, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of the dried Kind, ſuch as Bread, parched Corn, Pulſe, Figs, Raiſins, Dates, and the like, was ſpeedily got; and to join their Brethren of the ſame Tribe, at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rendezvous belonging to it. Here
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0177700400:367"/>
they were firſt muſtered by their reſpective Chiefs, or Captains of Hundreds, of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and at laſt by the Head of the whole Tribe. After which they had nothing to do, but to wait till the Orders came from above, when and whither to begin their March. Thus, <hi>Gibeah</hi> being ſituate about the Centre of <hi>Judea,</hi> or at about an equal Diſtance from <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> the two extreme Boundaries of it, North and South; it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe, that the Alarm had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both, by theſe expeditious Signals, long enough before the next Morning; whilſt thoſe that were ſeated nearer the Centre were, in all Likelihood, ready for March, as ſoon as they received their Orders and Route from their King or Chief: For I take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that theſe were not diſpatched to every City and Village of the Kingdom; which would have required too long a time, as well as too great a Number of Couriers, but were communicated only at this general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of each Tribe; and this, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was at, or near, the Place of Reſidence of each reſpective Chief of it. For this we find was the Method which the <hi>Levite</hi> took to acquaint all the Tribes with the Indignity
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0177700400:368"/>
offered to his Concubine at <hi>Gibeah; viz.</hi> by ſending to each of them a Piece of her mangled Body: And to each of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Aſſemblies it muſt reaſonably be ſup. poſed to have been, that <hi>Saul</hi> diſpatched his threatening Summons, accompanied with the Pieces of the hewn Oxen<note n="H" place="bottom">This laſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeems very much to confirm my laſt Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Orders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to the general Alarm, were not ſent to every City, Town, or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, but only to ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Places, as were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Men of each Tribe to repair to their reſpective Chiefs; elſe the two Oxen, though hewn ever ſo ſmall, could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſufficed them all: And much leſs ſo, if, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirms, and the original Word ſeems to countenance his Verſion of it, <hi>Saul</hi> only cut off the Legs of the Oxen, and ſent them by the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers<note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> vi. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note>. I may add, that the Expreſſion which we tranſlate, to all the Coaſts of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> might be more properly rendered, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Boundary, or, perhaps, rather, to every Place fixed and aſſigned for a Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, between Tribe and Tribe; or that appointed for their general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, whether upon civil or military Affairs. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering therefore the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſudden Irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they were expoſed to, from their Enemies within, and round about, them; there could not be a more expeditious Way found out, than for every Tribe to repair, armed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred, to ſuch appointed Places of Rendezvous, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Alarm, for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Armament; and there to wait for further Orders from above, how to act, and whither to march.</note>; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired them with ſuch a general Dread, and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0177700400:369"/>
Readineſs to obey them. By this excellent and expeditious Way, thoſe Tribes that were near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the Reſidence of their Judge or King, being the firſt that received both the Alarm, and Summons to Arms, could, in few Hours, be equipped, and ready to march to the Place appointed; and there begin to be reviewed, or even diſpatched upon any neceſſary Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; whilſt the more diſtant ones were daily arriving in their Turns, till they amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſufficient Number for the deſigned Enterprize. Allowing therefore the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead</hi> to have reached <hi>Gibeah</hi> on the firſt Evening of the Truce, and the general Alarm to have reached both Ends of the Kingdom in that one Night (both which I have ſhewn to have been very feaſible); where, I pray you, is the Impoſſibility, or even Improbability, that the moſt diſtant Tribes from <hi>Bezek,</hi> the Place of Rendezvous, which were thoſe of <hi>Judah, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> the fartheſt of which was not above 160 Miles, ſhould reach it in the following ſix Days, or even in leſs time, conſidering that they might take the Advantage of marching in Columns, thro' a Country that abounded with Highways, kept eaſy and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0177700400:370"/>
plain for Expedition; and that they had no other Luggage to retard them, than their Weapons and Proviſions, nor any Enemies to obſtruct their Way, or retard their Speed?</p>
               <p>But farther let me obſerve to you here, that if we compare the Muſter of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Army upon this Occaſion, with thoſe we find recorded both before and ſince that time, we ſhall find it to come ſo far ſhort of them<note n="I" place="bottom">Thus we find, in the War which the Tribes undertook againſt the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamites,</hi> mentioned in the laſt Eſſay, they amounted to 400,000 effective Men, excluſive of that of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
                     <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Jud.</hi> xx. 2.</note>: Whereas here <hi>Saul</hi> had but 330,000. In a <hi>Cenſus</hi> likewiſe which <hi>David</hi> cauſed to be made of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death, the total Sum of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was 800,000, and of <hi>Judah</hi> 500,000<note n="2" place="bottom">1 <hi>Kings</hi> xxiv. 9.</note>. So that the 30,000, which joined <hi>Saul,</hi> were but a ſmall Part of what this laſt Tribe muſt have amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, had he ſtaid for the reſt; who, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, being the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of all, were not able to reach him time enough, with all the Speed they could make; which, in this Caſe, was a ſufficient Excuſe.</note>, as to give us room to ſuppoſe, that he did not ſtay for the coming of thoſe that were the moſt remote; but that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that were already arrived, by the laſt Day of the Truce, to be more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0177700400:371"/>
for his Purpoſe, he gave immediate Orders for marching againſt the Enemy with all Speed, leaving the reſt to come after as ſoon as they could; ſince they were equally included in the Summons, and anſwerable for Non-attendance.</p>
               <p>For I muſt take Leave here to remind you of another Piece of their Diſcipline, mentioned in a former Eſſay, as eſtabliſhed among them by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua; viz.</hi> that every Male, from twenty to ſixty, was to be inrolled in his reſpective Tribe, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to appear in Arms under his reſpective Standard, upon every ſuch Alarm, under the ſevereſt Penalties; unleſs hindered by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Lameneſs, or any other lawful Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>What thoſe other Impediments and Abatements from the Rigour of this martial Law were, the Reader may ſee, among other Places, in</hi> Deut. xx. 5, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>. Theſe Rolls were ſo carefully kept, not only by the Heads of every Tribe, but by the inferior Captains of the Hundreds and Thouſands, and called over before and after the Engagement, that none could ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves without being diſcovered, and called to an Account for it. And this afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a farther Conveniency, that, as there was
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0177700400:372"/>
no Danger of their deſerting, ſo there was no Neceſſity of their marching in large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Bodies, unleſs it were through an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Country; but, in their own, they might ſafely move on towards the Rendezvous, in the moſt convenient or expeditious manner, as Occaſion required, ſo they but reached it time enough to anſwer to their Names, at the general Review. Let me add, that the dreadful Cataſtrophe of the Inhabitants of this very City of <hi>Jabeſh,</hi> who were all put to the Sword, except about 400 Virgins, for not having joined the reſt of the Tribes in the War they waged againſt that of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> two or three Centuries before, is a plain Indication of the Severity with which they puniſhed all ſuch Defaults. So that the very Name of <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead</hi> was enough, at this time, to remind the whole Nation of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of diſobeying <hi>Saul</hi>'s preſſing Commands. Thus, then, you ſee how poſſible, and even eaſy, it was for that Monarch to get ſuch a numerous Army ready at the Place of Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, and to lead them againſt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers time enough before the Expiration of the Truce; which ſurpriſing Diſpatch, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was chiefly owing to the excellent
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0177700400:373"/>
Laws, and military Diſcipline, which had been eſtabliſhed among them; ſo that by the Help of it he was able to accompliſh that, in five or ſix Days, which, without it, would have been impracticable in ſo many Weeks, and, in our Times, in ſo many Months. Hence therefore you may plainly ſee, it was not without good Grounds that I affirmed, that the pretended Impoſſibility, urged by our Critics, doth wholly proceed from their Ignorance of, or Inattention to, this Branch of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>I may, therefore, by this time, preſume to hope, that I have effectually removed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Difficulty that can be reaſonably raiſed againſt the Truth of this remarkable and ſignal Tranſaction. However, it may juſtly appear, when conſidered in all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and ſurpriſing Succeſs, to exceed any that we meet with, either in ſacred or profane Hiſtory. So that we need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it ſhould inſpire the <hi>Hebrews</hi> with ſuch extraordinary Regard for their new Monarch, that nothing leſs could now ſatisfy them, than the immediate Death of thoſe Malecontents, who had lately affronted him
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0177700400:374"/>
by their contemptuous Language and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our<note n="c" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 17, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> xxii. 17, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>: And had he been as vindictive and reſenting, as they were now zealous for him, he muſt unavoidably have ſullied the Glory of that noble Victory by ſuch a mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Piece of Revenge. But here alſo <hi>Saul</hi> ſhewed himſelf no leſs worthy to reign, by the ſingular and unhoped for Moderation he diſplayed on this Occaſion. <hi>As the Lord liveth,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>there ſhall no Man die this Day: For To-day the Lord hath wrought Salvation in</hi> Iſrael. And it was no ſmall Addition to his Glory, that he, who could ſhew ſuch a prodigious Ardour and Eagerneſs to ſhed the Blood of his Enemies, ſhould prove himſelf no leſs tender in ſparing that of his very worſt Subjects. Well might they triumph now, that they had a King indeed given to them by God! And ſuch an one, as they might firmly hope would, upon all Occaſions, behave as his choſen and worthy Vicegerent, whether in protecting his own People, ſuppreſſing their Enemies, or in the gaining the Love of ſuch of his rebellious Subjects, by his ſignal Benignity, whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Dignity, Valour, nor Conduct, could
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0177700400:375"/>
reduce to their Duty. Happy King! happy Subjects! happy in the Protection and Favour of the Divine Providence! happy in the Zeal and Harmony which now reigns between them, and the pleaſing Proſpect which they have now before them! But neither of them did continue long, either in this bliſsful Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or under the Favour of their Almighty Protector. <hi>Saul</hi> grew proud, diſobedient, and cruel<note n="d" place="bottom">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxi. 1.</note>; and was rejected by God; and the People, returning to their old Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and heatheniſh Idolatries, became ſuch Daſtards, and errant Cowards, that, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very next Danger that threatens them, inſtead of obeying his Summons, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him againſt the Enemy, with the ſame Courage and Readineſs they had done againſt the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> they only ſeek to <hi>hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Caves and Dens, in Rocks, high Places, and Pits, or to croſs over the</hi> Jordan <hi>into the Land of</hi> Gilead<note n="e" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xiii. 6, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>: Inſomuch that, when he came to number his ſmall Force, he found it dwindled to 600 Men<note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. ver.</hi> 15, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>, and all of them deſtitute of warlike Weapons. So evidently were <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Words verified in
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0177700400:376"/>
both, that their Succeſs and Happineſs would riſe and fall, according to the Regard they paid to their Divine Protector.</p>
               <p>But it is now high time for me to haſten to my laſt general Head; wherein I promiſed to lay before you, by way of Application, both the Shame and Diſgrace, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated Danger, to which your Diſobedience and Diſloyalty muſt inevitably expoſe you, if you ſhould ſtill perſiſt in imitating the cowardly <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in this laſt Inſtance, of Deſpondency, and Diſregard for the Safety of their King and Country, rather than in that noble and generous Eagerneſs, with which they accompanied their Prince to the Relief of their diſtreſſed Brethren. You may remember, that <hi>Saul</hi> had no ſooner muſtered his numerous Army at <hi>Bezek,</hi> and ſeen the ſurpriſing Readineſs with which they had complied with his Commands, than both he and they drew from it an happy Omen; and, as if they had been divinely inſpired, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of gaining the Victory, ſend a poſitive Promiſe to the <hi>Jabeſhites,</hi> that they ſhould receive the deſired Aſſiſtance, and be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the impending Danger, by the next
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0177700400:377"/>
riſing Sun<note n="g" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xi. 8, <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.</note>: In which they not only proved true Prophets, but, by the Divine Bleſſing, performed even more than they had promiſed (and perhaps more than they could have hoped for), in the total Overthrow they gave to the Enemy. But now, alas! how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent a Proſpect doth your late Behaviour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me, from that of the brave and generous <hi>Hebrews</hi> I have been entertaining you with! We are here met together, to beg the Divine Bleſſing, on an Expedition of no leſs Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>England,</hi> than the Deliverance of the <hi>Jabeſhites</hi> was to the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation; and which would yield you no leſs an Harveſt of Laurels, than that did to them. And had you bat ſhewn the ſame generous Ardor for the ſaving of a Mother City, and with it ſome Thouſands of brave loyal Fellow-Subjects, from the impending Danger of falling into the Hands of a no leſs cruel and inveterate Enemy; it might have been juſtly looked upon as an Earneſt of the Divine Aſſiſtance crowning you with the ſame Succeſs.</p>
               <p>But oh! what ſhall I ſay, or hope for, when I reflect on your late ſhameful Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0177700400:378"/>
little ſhort of a Revolt, compared with the glowing and generous Heat with which thoſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> Soldiers underwent greater Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues and Difficulties, than any you can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, to come at the Victory, on an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of much leſs Conſequence to their Commonwealth, than this you are ſummoned to is to ours? <hi>Jabeſh,</hi> being on the other Side <hi>Jordan,</hi> might have been loſt without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering any more than the ſmall Canton round about it; whereas, on the ſaving or loſing of this, depends, for ought we know, the Honour and Safety of our King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Preſervation of our Religion, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and whatever is, or ought to be, moſt dearly valued by us. Our brave <hi>Engliſh Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſhites</hi> are not, indeed, threatened with ſo dreadful a Brand of Infamy, as the Loſs of their Right Eyes, with that of their Liberty; but will not their Valour, and unſhaken Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, expoſe them to as diſmal a Fate, and to all the cruel Inſults of an enraged Enemy? And will they not rather chooſe to die Sword in Hand, in Defence of ſo noble and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cauſe, than to ſave their Lives at the Expence of their Honour and Loyalty? And can it be poſſible, that you ſhould, with your
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0177700400:379"/>
Eyes open, or rather judicially blinded, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo many thouſand noble and valuable Lives, and never more ſo than at this fatal Criſis, to be ſacrificed to your Baſeneſs and Treachery, to the Shame and Reproach of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name? What if your Commanders have, perhaps, ſhewed a little leſs Regard to your Conveniency, than to the Urgency of the preſent Occaſion, which calls you to fight <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> and juſtly challenges your utmoſt Courage and Speed; and in which we muſt conſequently be all either Actors or Traitors; either reach the wiſhed for Port of Victory, or be ſhipwrecked in the Ocean of an ignominious Slavery? Could it ever have been thought, that ſo great a Part of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army ſhould grudge a few more long Strides to reach the Enemy, before they can be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſtrong Reinforcement, which they only wait for, to renew the Attack with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Vigour and Efficacy? And which, if once received, will infallibly turn the Scale on their Side, and render all our Efforts againſt them more difficult and dangerous, if not to end in our total Defeat, and the Ruin of our Country? You will pleaſe to obſerve, that I have all along forborn entering into a ſtrict
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0177700400:380"/>
Inquiry into the Motives of your preſent Diſcontent, as a Matter quite out of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and which may be more ſafely refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe whom Providence has ſet over you; and are beſt acquainted with our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Exigencies, and the propereſt means of ſupplying of them. But it behoves me here to take Notice to you, of a ſtrange Saying, now current amongſt you, which is become a kind of Watch-word, and gives one but to much Reaſon to think, that ſome Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans have been the Leaders of this rebellious Dance. I mean that Text in <hi>Job</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Job</hi> xii. 11.</note>, that <hi>Wiſdom is with the Antients:</hi> By which you would ſeem to inſinuate, as if thoſe few old Leaders knew much better what is ſit, or not ſit, to be done, upon this Emergency, than thoſe who ſit at the Helm, and have a Right to direct and command you. But, let me tell you, this is another of your bungling Ways of interpreting the Scriptures; and that <hi>Job</hi> meant nothing leſs, than what you would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort from him: He expected, indeed, to have found it ſo; and that his three old Viſitors would have proved much better Counſellors and Comforters than they did: But, upon
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0177700400:381"/>
finding himſelf ſadly diſappointed, you may ſee plainly enough, that he ſcruples not to expoſe both their boaſted Wiſdom and Kindneſs in ſuch ſtrong Terms, as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſerved. Nay, you'll find, if you read on but to the thirty-ſecond and following Chapters, how <hi>Elihu,</hi> tho' a much younger and modeſter Perſon, diſplay'd a much higher Degree of Wiſdom, and ſublimer Theology, than they all; and how ſeverely God himſelf reproved thoſe three Pretenders, for their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Folly: And I doubt not but thoſe Antients, who are the Fomenters of your preſent Diſcontent, will, upon a fuller In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, be found to be Men of the ſame, if not worſe, Leaven; wiſe indeed in their own and your Opinion, but Traitors in their Hearts. But what I would gladly know is, what Arguments theſe old Pretenders to ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Wiſdom could uſe, to draw you into this dangerous and ſhameful Step: Not ſurely ſuch as flow from Scripture; for that plainly tells you, that Obedience is better than Sacrifice; and that Rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 23.): Nor yet from Reaſon; for that goes Hand in Hand with the Word of God; and both will tell you, that Anarchy
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0177700400:382"/>
and Ruin muſt be the neceſſary Conſequence of all ſuch unnatural Defections, if not timely ſuppreſſed, when our All lies at Stake, as it doth now. What then could they urge to faſcinate and bewitch you into this baſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty? Have they chilled your daſtardly Hearts with the falſe Pretence of ſome great Diſparity between you and the Enemy you are to engage? At preſent, Thanks be to God, you are greatly ſuperior to them in Number; and might be much more ſo in Strength and Courage, would but your tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Spirit ſuffer you to conſider, what a juſt Cauſe you are engaged in, and what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there is to hope, that we have a juſt God on our Side. And you, as well as I, may well enough remember the times when this very laſt Conſideration would have inſpired an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hoſt, on an Occaſion like this, with ſuch noble Ardour, that they would have deſpiſed much greater Difficulties to attack an Enemy, though in all other reſpects ſuperior to them. The Time was, I ſay, and you cannot but know, when the Greatneſs of the Danger, Fatigues, or other Obſtacles, would, on ſuch an Emergency as you are now called upon, have only ſerved to whet their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0177700400:383"/>
and inflame their Hearts with a noble Ardor, either to conquer or die in ſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Cauſe: Whence then this ſtrange, this ſhameful, this ill-boding, Change? Hath your old martial Genius forſaken you? Are Loyalty to your King, the Love of your Country, and Zeal for our Religion, ſo far extinguiſhed in you, by a few Days unuſual Fatigue, that you ſhould all appear thus reſolutely, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treacherouſly, bent againſt complying with the Orders of your Commanders, and acting with the requiſite Diſpatch, which alone, for aught you know, can prevent our preſent Danger from becoming deſperate, and the Loſs of our Laws and Liberties irretrieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? How ſhall we interpret this monſtrous Behaviour, this unnatural Defection, of yours? Muſt we take it as a ſad Omen, that God hath forgot to be gracious to this once happy Iſle? and that he will no longer protect our religious and civil Rights, againſt the avowed Enemies of both? Good Heaven preſerve us from ſo ungrateful a Deſpondency! God is ſtill able to ſave us, whether by few or many; and is never more ready to do ſo, than when called upon in our greateſt Extremities. And ſhould you ſtill obſtinately perſiſt in your
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0177700400:384"/>
Diſobedience, or even turn your Arms againſt your native Country—But Heaven be praiſed, who bids me, by your relenting Tears, and ſudden Change, to hope for better things, and to expect a quite contrary Behaviour, from you! A Behaviour, worthy of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Blood you boaſt of; and ſuch as will not only wipe off the Shame and Diſgrace of your baſe Murmurings and Complaints, but yield you, in a few Days, a plentiful Harveſt of Laurels, and to the Nation a joyful Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Thankſgiving: Whilſt the Remorſe for your late Defection inſpires your Hearts with freſh Motives of Courage and Loyalty, and with ſuch Confidence in God, and Pity for your diſtreſſed Fellow-Subjects, as may bring down a Bleſſing from Heaven upon our preſent Expedition. Heaven alone knows what will be the Effect of this happy Change I perceive in you: I may, perhaps, have given my Hopes too great a Scope; we are naturally apt to do ſo in things which we moſt earneſtly wiſh; and, for that Reaſon, am the more willing to ſubmit the Event of it to him, who alone could ſo timely work it in you: For, if it prove ſincere and laſting, I ſhall have much greater Cauſe to aſcribe it to his
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0177700400:385"/>
Grace, than to any thing that I did, or could have preſſed, upon the preſent Occaſion, from that ſingular and ſucceſsful Example of the generous <hi>Hebrew</hi> Monarch. And if his Goodneſs ſhould magnify itſelf ſtill further in our Favour, and crown this preſent Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize with the deſired Succeſs; if the ſame Divine Aſſiſtance, which ſeems to have thus timely rekindled your wonted Valour and Courage in your Breaſts, ſhould farther enable you, as it did thoſe noble <hi>Hebrews,</hi> not only to free your diſtreſſed Fellow-Subjects from the impending Danger they are in, but to give the Enemies of our Country as total an Over-throw as they did to theirs; if this, I ſay, ſhould prove the happy Iſſue of this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall have the leſs to ſay to you, by way of Warning; ſince your late Miſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and Defection, duly laid to Heart, will be the beſt Antidote I can give you, againſt your becoming inſolent and arrogant, or your aſcribing any Part of the Glory to any, but to his divine and all-gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>However, as there may be ſtill ſome Cauſe to fear, leſt this ſudden and unhoped for
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0177700400:386"/>
Change ſhould not prove ſo ſteady and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, as I do heartily wiſh it to be; and leſt there ſhould ſtill remain, in any of your Breaſts, ſome bitter Root of Diſcontent and Murmuring againſt your Superiors; I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Diſcourſe with one Conſideration more, which I earneſtly adviſe you to mind (whatever elſe you may think unworthy your Attention with reſpect to what I have hitherto ſaid); and that is, that if there be ſtill any ſuch amongſt you, that have ſo far hardened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Sword of the Spirit, by which I have been ſtriving to reduce you to a Senſe of your Duty and Loyalty, and is the only kind of Weapon that our Church is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to uſe; they will find, to their Coſt and Sorrow, that the State is entruſted to, and, Thanks be to Heaven, is ſtill in Poſſeſſion of, one of a much harder Metal, and keener Edge, and ſuch as will admit of no Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And this I am bound in Duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you of, more particularly at this time, not only as it is equally granted by God, for the Puniſhment of the ſtubborn and diſloyal, as for the Preſervation and Defence of the peaceable and liege Subject<note n="i" place="bottom">

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0177700400:387"/>
as it cannot be made uſe of to a better and more honourable End, than againſt the baſe and cowardly Betrayers, as well as againſt the open and avowed Invaders, of our-civil and religious Rights and Properties. But I muſt call to mind, that you will, in a few Hours, be ſummoned to march; and ſhall cloſe this Diſcourſe, as the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> did to the murmuring <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xii. 23.</note>; <hi>As for me, God forbid that I ſhould ceaſe praying and interceding for you, and ſhewing you the good and right Way;</hi> your Duty to your King and Country, and the Guilt and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of oppoſing yourſelves againſt it! And may the Divine Goodneſs inſpire your Breaſts with ſuch a Senſe of both, that you may all behave, on the approaching Juncture, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and Proteſtants; that our Meeting on the next Sabbath-Day may be ſuch, as may afford a joyful Subject for Praiſe and Thankſgiving, for the Succeſs of this Expedition. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>The CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>THUS far, Sir, went this occaſional Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which, as I formerly hinted to you, had the deſired Effect on the lower Claſs of the Audience, to whom it ſeemed chieny directed; tho', in Fact, principally le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled againſt the Heads of thoſe Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. You will excuſe me, if my Fear of hurting ſome of them, who are ſtill alive, and, I hope, in a better Mind, reſtrains me from giving you any farther Account of the Occaſion of it, than that the underhand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of this Defection being moſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Deiſts and Republicans, though, in other reſpects, Men of Figure and Authority, there was an abſolute Neceſſity to draw away the inferior Officers and Soldiers from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Confidence they put in them: And this, it was thought, could not be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually done, conſidering the Shortneſs of the time, than by cauſing ſome ſuch rouſing Diſcourſe as this to be penned, and preached to them; and, at the ſame time, by making Choice of ſome ſuch curious and uncommon Topics, as might, as much as poſſible, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0177700400:389"/>
the Attention of thoſe Leaders, who were Men of Parts, and polite Literature, in order to prevent their cauſing any Diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which might interrupt the Preacher from going on.</p>
               <p>The Taſk of penning it being impoſed upon me, the Urgency of the Occaſion, and the ſhort time given me to perform it, ſoon brought into my Mind that noble and ſignal Overthrow, which <hi>Saul,</hi> the new <hi>Hebrew</hi> King, gave to the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> a Subject up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I had formerly beſtowed ſome Pains, and which now appeared to me ſo ſuitable to the Occaſion, that I immediately ſet about and dreſſed it up in the Form, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and very Words, in which you have ſeen it above; excepting only that I have thrown ſome Geographical, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory Remarks, into Notes; which, in ſome meaſure, clogged and interrupted the Stile of the Text. An Inconveniency which could not be ſo well avoided, in a Diſcourſe that was to be delivered off-hand to an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as when it is penned to be read at one's Leiſure. However, the Piece was liſtened to without Interruption; and was
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0177700400:390"/>
ſcarcely finiſhed, before the good Effect of it appeared, in the ſurpriſing Change it wrought on the malecontent. Troops, as well as in the Succeſs that crowned, ſoon after, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved Loyalty and Bravery.</p>
               <p>I ſhall take it as a Favour, if you'll let me know, in your next, how it is reliſhed by your Sceptic Neighbours; after which I ſhall readily ſend you my Anſwers to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Queries and Objections, with all the Diſpatch I am able to make: Being, in the Interim,</p>
